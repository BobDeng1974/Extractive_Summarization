@entity14 rising star @entity13 is among the models allegedly diverted away from the agency to a rival business set up by @entity3			1
@entity18 - whose staff and models are the subject of the @entity23 ‘ the @entity24 ’ - has accused mr @entity3 of poaching models while still under their employment			1
a top judge has heard that the former male model was so good at his job that , at times , he generated a third of @entity34 's income			0
mr @entity3 was dismissed from his position on july 24 and he was served with court papers on the same day			2
the case has now reached @entity8 ’s @entity5 , with @entity38 , for the agency , telling judge @entity40 that mr @entity3 is accused of ' diverting away ' models from @entity34 to a rival modelling business - whilst still in the agency ’s employ			1
mr @entity38 also accused mr @entity3 of ' perpetrating a very serious fraud ' whilst working for premier and of breaching his contract of employment			1
mr @entity3 is claimed to have tried to gain an unfair competitive advantage for new model management venture , @entity51 ( @entity52 ) , which he is alleged to have started up in january this year with business partner , @entity53			1
the allegations of diverting models relate to three individuals who are on the books of @entity52 , mr @entity38 told the court , including @entity14 rising star , @entity13 , and @entity60 , a @entity61 model , who was the runner up of @entity23 ’s @entity63 show			2
@entity53 and @entity52 are also defendants in the action			0
@entity13 , left , and @entity60 , right , are two of the models @entity3 is accused of ' diverting ' from his former employers nasty : the claws are out between @entity18 - whose staff and models were the subject of @entity23 ' the @entity24 ' - and one of the stars of show , @entity3 , back left mr @entity38 told the judge : ' what we have here is a case of real damage that has been perpetrated on the claimant and we want to get on with this case and find out exactly what the damage is , so we can get on with rectifying the situation with our customers , our clients and models			1
' there is a prima facie case that a very serious fraud has been perpetrated , ' he added , asking for the judge to make an interim order that mr @entity3 disclose to his former employers ' all confidential information or property in his possession , but belonging to the claimant			1
' the barrister said @entity34 - whose boss @entity100 and chief booker @entity101 attended the hearing - were seeking that order because , ' mr @entity3 still is n’t coming to heel and doing that which he needs to do to remedy the situation he had created			1
' ' mr @entity3 has acted for eight or nine months completely behind our backs and deceitfully			2
we do n’t know what he ’s done			0
we want him to tell us what he ’s been up to , ' the barrister said			0
@entity111 , for mr @entity3 , mr @entity53 and @entity52 , asked for the application for the ' onerous order ' to be rejected , saying that it would unfairly restrict mr @entity3 ’s ability to earn a living when no wrongdoing has been proved against him			2
she described mr @entity3 as ' good at his job , well known in the industry and he has a lot of contacts , ' saying the claim was ' an attempt to stifle him and prevent him earning money doing his job and using his skills elsewhere			2
' ' the claimant has not shown what this unfair competitive advantage that the defendant has gained is			0
we contend that his summary dismissal was wrongful			0
they should not have dismissed him but they did , ' she added			0
denying there had been any wrongdoing , let alone fraud , by mr @entity3 , miss @entity111 went on : ' the claimants contacted him to say they were concerned about his loyalty to the business			1
' they put the case that he was working for @entity52 during his employment ... he said he was willing to talk to them about that but did n’t hear anything back until he received a claim form			0
' judge @entity150 , delivering his ruling , allowed @entity152 ’ application for disclosure , giving mr @entity3 seven days in which to produce the material requested			2
legal arguments : the case at the @entity5 , pictured , has heard that mr @entity3 has been accused of ' perpetrating a very serious fraud ' whilst working for @entity34 and of breaching his contract of employment the judge said : ' this is case where it is alleged that mr @entity3 , who was an employee of the claimant since 2007 , has been in breach of the terms of his employment contract by taking steps to set up a rival business with his business partner mr @entity53 from january this year			1
' it is said that he has been passing on copyrighted information and other material with a view to gaining an advantage for the rival business			0
' there is a clear prima facie case of a flagrant breach of those obligations which mr @entity3 owed and would have realised on the face of it were his obligations , and would justify in my judgement various forms of relief			2
' this is a case where serious allegations are made that £ 850 was charged to clients of @entity152 which related to a model of @entity52 ’s			0
i do n’t see how that can be anything but an attempt to defraud @entity152 , ' he went on			0
' in all the circumstances , it seems to me that , while the orders may be onerous , there is a strong arguable case for interim relief			0
the claimants are entitled to protect their business , ' he said			0
