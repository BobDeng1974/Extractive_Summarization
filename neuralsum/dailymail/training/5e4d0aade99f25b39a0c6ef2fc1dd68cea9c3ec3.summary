by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 09:50 est , 18 october 2013 updated : 10:00 est , 18 october 2013 third class rail travel could return to @entity4 as the government faced claims it was turning the clock back half a century			0
plans to re-privatise the @entity10 main line from @entity11 to @entity12 include proposals for three different classes of travel			1
unions warned the return to a controversial ticketing system , not seen since it was ditched by @entity19 in june 1956 , raised the prospect of cut - price budget service seen on airlines like @entity23			1
back to basics : the idea of a third class of train travel would mark a return to a system not seen for 50 years unions also accused the government of trying to ‘ bulldoze through ’ the re-privatisation of the @entity10 line which has been in state hands for four years			1
the @entity35 ( @entity35 ) said it had seen a copy of the prospectus for returning the @entity38 to a private operator by early 2015			0
the @entity40 has been considering recreating a third class of rail travel for at least a year			1
ministers have suggested it could be an additional class of travel between the existing first and standard classes – broadly equivalent to a ' premium economy ' class on airlines			1
it comes just days after transport secretary @entity51 suggested the government could strip out first class carriages from busy routes to make more room for standard ticket holders			1
on track : the @entity10 line has been in state hands since 2009 , but ministers want it returned to the private sector by 2015 @entity62 - topped : it was only in 1844 that the law was passed to ensure third - class carriages were covered			1
this drawing appeared in a newspaper in 1847 third class travel first became an option in 1838			2
six years later an act of parliament forced train companies to provide a roof in third class			0
the @entity74 stipulated that all third - class passengers should be carried in covered accommodation			1
railway companies also began providing lighting in third - class carriages			2
however , whereas there were several oil lamps in the first class carriages , third - class carriages only had one			2
in 1844 the railways introduced @entity85 for government workers			0
the @entity88 car , introduced in @entity4 in 1874 , created a new level of comfort			0
@entity91 abolished second class travel in 1875 , upgrading third class passengers to second class standards			2
other railways followed the example			0
second class disappeared from fare tables until 1956 , when third class was renamed second			0
@entity19 later renamed this standard class			1
but @entity35 general secretary @entity101 said : ‘ this leaked document , coming on the day of union protests at @entity104 aimed at keeping the @entity10 in public ownership , is political dynamite which blows the lid off the lengths to which the government are prepared to go to bulldoze through re-privatisation before the next election			0
‘ if the government are allowed to get away with this , passengers can expect third class services , shoddy performance and higher fares while the private companies get a gold - plated , eleven year franchise that will enable them to launder hundreds of millions of pounds into the pockets of their shareholders			1
it stinks and it must be stopped			0
’ he said if the third - class plan went ahead it could be a ' @entity23 model with passengers rammed in to creaking cattle trucks with a surcharge for everything from your bags to using the lavatories '			1
the draft prospectus gives firms bidding for the franchise to run services on the line the option of establishing an intermediate ‘ class between @entity142 and @entity143 ’			1
it could mean customers who book standard tickets in advance are guaranteed a seat , while those without bookings are crushed into even less space in what would effectively be third class			2
@entity154 , @entity155 ’s shadow transport secretary , said : ‘ @entity156 says we 're all in this together , but if that 's true then why is he going back to the 1950s and reintroducing third class ? ‘ @entity10 passengers deserve better than this			2
@entity10 is working well and will have returned £ 800 million to the taxpayer by the end of this financial year			0
’ campaigners have highlighted figures announced last week which showed that @entity10 paid £ 208 million in premium and dividend payments to the @entity168 in the last financial year			0
anger : @entity35 union boss @entity101 said the plan to re-privatise the @entity38 ' stinks ' and should be stopped its turnover increased by 4.2 per cent and it carried more than 19 million passengers - up 1 per cent on the previous year			2
the campaigners also point out that figures from the @entity176 show that @entity10 received the lowest public subsidy of any rail operator by some considerable margin			0
in addition , those keen to keep @entity10 publicly run say that the government is rushing through this particular re-franchising so it takes place before the 2015 general election			0
a @entity40 spokesman said : ‘ the independent @entity187 into rail franchising was clear that franchising remains the best way to secure services for passengers			1
‘ a strong private - sector partner will not only provide certainty of ownership for the @entity10 franchise but will be best placed to build on the significant investment planned for the route , delivering benefits to passengers and taxpayers for years to come			0

@entity40 included option in prospectus for line sell - off
expected to include an extra tier between first class and standard class
unions warn it will mean ' passengers rammed in to creaking cattle trucks '
