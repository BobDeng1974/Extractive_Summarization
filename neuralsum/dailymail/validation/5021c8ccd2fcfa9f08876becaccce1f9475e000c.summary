he said : ' the low level of weaponry is extraordinary by today 's standards			0
there 's a pellet gun , crossbow and what looks like a child 's catapult			1
' some of the items are somewhat more serious like @entity5 's bayonet and knife , but then there is also his artist 's paint set			1
' these really are the personal effects of the twins			2
amongst @entity6 's objects there is his cigarette case , comb and draught set as well as a sawn - off shotgun			1
' and then again showing another side there 's his pen and his infamous glasses			2
' also in a letter from their mother to a friend discussing her sons , she mentions that they ' are the most understanding and kindest of people one could meet and they have never hurt anyone only their own kind			0

pictured : @entity6 's cigarette case mr @entity15 , curator of @entity100 museum in the @entity18 , said he was given the items by @entity5 and his family			1

they were gifted to me after a visit to see him at @entity218			0
' i became friendly with him and he basically donated quite a number of items for display at what we call the " @entity225 " collection at @entity226			2
' mr @entity15 said the pair became friendly after @entity5 contacted him with a view to donating some of his items			1
he said : ' he contacted me with a view to introducing himself and a number of other notorious gangland figures who have since donated a number of items for display at the museum			2
' i visited him several times in prison in the 1990s			0

' he added that the museum is a ' very controversial and politically incorrect museum ' and said it 's ' not everyone ’s cup of tea '			0
the @entity5 were almost born into a life of crime			2
their father , @entity270 , was hardly the ideal role model			0
at the outbreak of the @entity272 he was called up to join the @entity273 , but deserted			0
frequently away from home and up to no good , the twins probably saw more of the police , who kept visiting their house at 178 @entity279 in @entity109 , than they did their father			2
it was up to their mother , @entity47 , to keep the family together , which was a struggle			0
from left to right : @entity5 , @entity245 and @entity5 outside their home in @entity109 , east @entity65 for a while , her three sons stayed out of trouble , and spent much of their spare time in the boxing ring , where the twins would win many a competition			1
however , by their late teens , @entity6 and @entity5 were also fighting on the streets , and they soon started their own gang			2
when they turned 18 in 1951 , they decided that military service was not for them			0
they spent most of their @entity69 in the guardroom			0
matters came to a head when they were arrested for assaulting a policemen , and were imprisoned in @entity306 , @entity307			0
upon their return to the @entity23 , it was clear they would never settle into regular lives			0
their first business venture was a club called the @entity316 , off the @entity317 , which looked like a dive from the outside but which the @entity5 turned into a glamorous , fashionable nightspot			2
@entity6 and @entity5 pictured in the 1960s in their sharp suits , they did their best to maintain , publicly at least , a veneer of respectability , but they were involved in just about every form of criminality imaginable , from straightforward theft to gang violence and - ultimately - murder			1
of the two siblings , @entity6 was considered the more dangerous			0
he was imprisoned in 1957 for @entity333			0
while locked up , he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia , which partly explained his violent tendencies			0
unusually for that time , @entity6 was also publicly bisexual , which @entity5 found difficult to accept			1
despite @entity5 also being jailed in 1959 , the @entity5 ' ' business ' activities went from strength to strength , and by the @entity341 they were hobnobbing with stars such as @entity343 , and eminent politicians such as @entity345 , with whom @entity6 is likely to have had an affair			2
@entity6 remained unmarried , and @entity5 's marriage to @entity348 in 1965 only lasted for eight months			2
it is thought that she committed suicide , although according to one account , @entity348 was murdered by @entity6 , for reasons that are unclear			0
in the middle of 1968 , the twins ’ older brother @entity245 were arrested for murder			0
@entity6 had shot a rival gang member called @entity75 in the face when he was drinking in a pub , and @entity5 , normally the ' gentle ' one , had repeatedly stabbed gang member @entity78 ' the @entity79 in the face and neck for not following orders			2
both men were given life sentences , with a recommendation that they should serve at least 30 years			0
@entity245 was sent down for ten years , for being an accessory to the murder of @entity368			0
