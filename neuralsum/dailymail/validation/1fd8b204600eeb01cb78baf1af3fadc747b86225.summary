it was one of the deadliest attacks during @entity2 leaving more than 100,000 people dead and destroying large parts of @entity5 but is often forgotten from history			1
now 70 years on , new before and after pictures have been released showing how the @entity8 capital recovered after the firebomb strike that killed more than @entity10 in a single night			1
on march 10 , 1945 , @entity13 b - 29 bombers flew over @entity5 in the dead of night , dumping massive payloads of cluster bombs			1
the raids left a fifth of @entity5 smouldering under an expanse of charred bodies and rubble			2
but the attack , and similar ones that followed in more than 60 other @entity8 cities , have received little attention and were eclipsed by the atomic bombings and @entity8 's postwar rush to rebuild			1
where earlier raids targeted aircraft factories and military facilities , the @entity5 firebombing was aimed largely at civilians , in places including @entity5 's downtown @entity73 area , where people lived in traditional wood and paper homes at densities sometimes exceeding 100,000 people per square mile			1
exhausted residents also chose to pull blankets over their heads and sleep when air - raid sirens blew instead of heading to shelters turned icy by an unusually cold winter			2
@entity87 , was just eight when the bombs fell and was among many survivors who kept silent about that night until recently			2
a half - century passed before she even shared her experiences with her own son			2
despite the massive bombing campaign , the @entity92 , left , and the @entity95 department store , right , remained standing today , the bar and the department store still remain as commuters in @entity5 cross the road outside the two buildings , which are still in use she said : ' our parents would just say , " that 's a different era			2
" ' they would n't talk about it			0
and i figured my own family would n't understand			0
' ms @entity87 , now 78 , was mesmerised as she watched the attack from a railway embankment			2
she added : ' it was a blazing firestorm			0
i saw a baby catch fire on its mother 's back			0
and she could n't put out the fire			0
' i saw a horse being led by its owner			0
the horse balked and the cargo on its back caught fire , then its tail , and it burned alive , as the owner just stood there and burned with it			0
' the destruction in the area around the @entity127 after the @entity5 firebombing			2
the attack , and similar ones that followed in more than 60 other @entity8 cities , received little attention on the 70th anniversary of the bombing campaign a man walks near to the bridge among the modern high rise buildings which make up the @entity5 skyline from january 1944 to august 1945 , the @entity13 dropped 157,000 tons of bombs on @entity8 cities , according to the @entity141 the same area now , which is popular with locals and tourists and boasts of shops and restaurants			1
@entity8 rushed to rebuild their capital city at the end of the war @entity151 , then 13 , fled his family 's noodle shop with a friend			1
turned back by firefighters , they headed toward @entity157 and again were ordered back and they crouched in a factory yard , waiting as flames consumed their neighborhood			0
he explained : ' we saw a fire truck heaped with a mountain of bones			0
it was hard to understand how so many bodies could be piled up like that			0
' survivors also speak of the hush as dawn broke over a wasteland of corpses and debris , studded by chimneys of bathhouses and small factories			0
from january 1944 to august 1945 , the @entity13 dropped 157,000 tons of bombs on @entity8 cities , according to the @entity141			1
nine days after the bombing campaign , a man walks across the @entity127 bridge among the devastation caused in @entity5 by the bombs in an image taken from the same spot 70 years on , another man walks across the same bridge , with new buildings in the background it estimated that 333,000 people were killed in total , including the 80,000 killed in the august 6 @entity58 atomic - bomb attack and 40,000 at @entity10 three days later			1
the bombing campaign set a military precedent for targeting civilian areas that persisted into the @entity198 and @entity199 wars and beyond			0
but the non-atomic attacks have been largely overlooked			0
@entity201 , a @entity202 history professor said : ' both governments , the press , media , radio , even novelists ... decided the crucial story was the atomic bomb			0
' this allowed them to avoid addressing some very important questions			0
' destruction : the @entity95 department store days after the firebomb campaign saw 2,000 tonnes of explosives dropped on @entity5 exactly 70 years ago on march 9 , 1945 , @entity13 warplanes launched a huge firebomb campaign against @entity8 by dropping 2,000 tonnes of explosives over @entity5			1
the raids targeted a 16 square mile area across the @entity8 capital , killing 104,500 civilians , making it the deadliest conventional air raid ever			1
the campaign began early on march 9 , when @entity13 @entity228 crews met on islands off the coast of @entity8 for a military briefing			1
the plan was to attack @entity5 at a low level that evening using aircraft that were stripped of all of their guns			1
the decrease in weight meant that the planes were able to increase their bomb load capacity and speed when flying			0
it is believed that @entity13 general @entity242 said they were going to deliver a ' big firecracker '			2
the firebombing was aimed largely at civilians , in places including @entity5 's downtown @entity73 area , where people lived in traditional wood and paper homes at densities sometimes exceeding 100,000 people per square mile			1
around 334 bombers were used in the raid and exhausted residents chose to pull blankets over their heads and sleep when air - raid sirens blew instead of heading to shelters turned icy by an unusually cold winter			2
this meant that there was huge human carnage with the smell of burning flesh even making the pilots grab oxygen masks to stop themselves from vomiting			0
from january 1944 to august 1945 , the @entity13 dropped 157,000 tons of bombs on @entity8 cities , according to the @entity141			1
it estimated that 333,000 people were killed , including the 80,000 killed in the august 6 @entity58 atomic - bomb attack and 40,000 at @entity10 three days later .			1

exactly 70 years ago , more than 100,000 people were killed in a @entity5 air strike during the @entity2
came as @entity13 bombers dumped cluster bombs and destroyed a fifth of the @entity8 capital in just one night
the attack was more deadly than @entity10 but received little attention as @entity5 rebuilt itself *quickly* after the war
new then and now pictures have been released showing how @entity8 recovered following @entity2
