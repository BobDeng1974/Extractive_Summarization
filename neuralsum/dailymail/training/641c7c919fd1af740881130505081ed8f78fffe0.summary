by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 has boasted he is smarter than @entity3 , and does not need anyone else to tell him what to think			1
in a bid to shake off his reputation for being ‘ weird ’ , the @entity7 leader posed at home in casualwear for a newspaper interview to prove he ready to be prime minister			1
but mr @entity2 ’s claim to have ‘ much more intellectual self - confidence ’ risked backfiring because he actually got a worse degree than mr @entity3			2
labour leader @entity2 boasted that he has the ' intellectual confidence ' to take on @entity3 , despite gaining an inferior degree a recent poll found 40 per cent of people think mr @entity2 is ‘ weird ’ and a third suspected he was bullied at school			1
labour strategists privately admit that many voters are put - off by their leader ’s focus on abstract concepts such as ‘ pre-distribution ’ , ‘ predators ’ and ‘ responsible capitalism ’			0
today he moved to win over swing voters in the @entity31 with a pledge to crackdown on rich landlords buying up property in @entity36 but leaving it empty			2
the announcement will be used to prove he is in touch with ordinary voters ' concerns			0
meanwhile , portraying mr @entity2 as ‘ weird ’ and ill - suited to being prime minister is expected to be a key plank of the @entity44 election attack			1
@entity3 , pictured in @entity45 today , gained a first class degree in @entity47 in an interview with the @entity49 today , mr @entity2 brushed off the abuse , claiming he is clever than mr @entity3			1
he said : ‘ what ’s interesting is that of the two leaders in this who could be prime minister , between myself and @entity3 , i feel i am the one with much more intellectual self - confidence , actually			2
‘ i ’m not the guy who says , “ oh i just want to be prime minister because it is a place to reach ”			0
i actually have strong beliefs about how to change the country			0
this is an incredibly powerful weapon			0
‘ if you think about what sustains me — and it is not the easiest job in the world being leader of the opposition — what sustained me over three - and - a - half years is that sense of deep conviction			0
‘ i look at @entity3 across the dispatch box and i think to myself , i ’m the one with the intellectual self - confidence because i actually know what i believe and i do n’t need @entity73 to tell me			1
’ he added that mr @entity3 was trying to avoid election tv debates because ‘ he obviously does n’t have the confidence ’			2
however , making an issue of intelligence could come back to haunt mr @entity2 , who famously only secured a 2:1 in @entity47 ( @entity47 ) at @entity79 , @entity80			1
mr @entity3 , by contrast , gained a first after studying @entity47 at @entity82 , @entity80			1
a poll in march by @entity84 for @entity85 found some 41 per cent of voters think @entity2 is ' weird ' , compared to only 27 per cent who thought the same of @entity3 more than half of under - 24s think mr @entity2 is weird , the opinion poll found mr @entity2 also rejected the idea that the @entity92 will portray him as ‘ weird ’ as the general election nears			1
‘ have they decided that ? i think the @entity92 are very unclear how they are to attack me			0
half the time they say it is “ back to the @entity100 ”			0
half the time they say , “ he does n’t seem to stand for anything ”			0
’ mr @entity2 meanwhile today promised a new crackdown on ' ghost homes ' being hoarded by wealthy investors across @entity36			1
the @entity7 leader claimed rich owners leave 60,000 properties standing empty driving in the capital up house prices for everyone else			1
he told the @entity49 : ' we ’ve got to stop this phenomenon of empty properties being bought by overseas investors and nothing done about it			0
' we live in one of the richest , most diverse and exciting cities that has ever existed on the planet , but the connection between the great wealth @entity36 creates and everyday family finances has been broken			0
' @entity7 would double council tax for owners who let their flats lie empty and unused			2
and after the property has been empty for a year , councils would have powers to impose a 100 per cent increase in bills .			0

@entity7 leader boasts of how he is smarter across the dispatch box
*ignores* ' weird ' jibe and claims @entity44 attacks on him are confused
but he only got a 2:1 in @entity47 at @entity80 , @entity3 got a first
@entity2 also *unveils* crackdown on rich *landowners* leaving homes empty
says 60,000 ' ghost homes ' pushing up prices of ordinary family properties
