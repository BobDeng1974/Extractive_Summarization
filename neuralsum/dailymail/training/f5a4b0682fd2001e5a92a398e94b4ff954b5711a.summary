@entity0 , @entity1 ’s youngest ever international is not signing for anyone before the end of monday 's transfer deadline day , according to sources very close to the 15 - year - old			1
lots of big clubs remain interested in @entity0 , who is currently with the @entity1 @entity10 team , including @entity11 and @entity12			1
he more than anyone else linked with a transfer today has time on his side			2
he can wait for six months and move when he ’s 16			2
@entity0 's father , @entity34 , told @entity35 : ' we have feet on the ground but we know everything has taken off and there 's so much attention on him			1
i 've said to all the agents and the clubs that he is too young to go alone			0
' i do n't think it 's good for any 15 or 16 - year - old boy to move abroad to a different country with a different language , different culture , to be alone sitting in a flat , coming in late on february nights , hungry			1
you need a family to feel secure			1
' so if that 's going to happen soon , we move with him			2
and that 's not easy because i have a job , working for my father - in - law 's textile shops , and we have a family			1
' @entity60 belief : @entity0 takes a picture before his international debut against the @entity63 and @entity18 manager @entity64 told @entity35 : ' we can not do anything			1
we 're a small club in @entity1			0
we 've got a kid that everybody is after			0
if somebody comes to get him , he will leave			0
' it 's pretty simple , really			0
but i still believe the best way for him to develop is by playing first team football and this is one of the only places he is going to play first team football			0
i think he 's at the right place			0
for at least another year - and - a - half , maybe two years , he 's at the right club			1
' @entity0 made his international debut for @entity1 on august 27 in a friendly against @entity63 at the age of 15 years and 253 days			2
in doing so he broke a record that had stood for more than a century and almost marked his debut with a goal in a game that finished 0 - 0			0
@entity88 face @entity1 next monday in a friendly at @entity90 , but @entity0 has not made the cut			2
floored genius : the teenager could have a massive future in the game after early hype			0

@entity0 was linked with @entity11
the 15 - year - old caught attention of @entity26 's elite and is up for grabs
@entity0 's father tells @entity35 that his family would move with him , but this is now likely to be in a future transfer *window*
' i do n't think it 's good for any 15 or 16 - year - old boy to move abroad to a different country with a different language , different culture , ' he says
' you need a family to feel secure . so if that 's going to happen soon , we move with him , ' adds @entity0 's father @entity34
