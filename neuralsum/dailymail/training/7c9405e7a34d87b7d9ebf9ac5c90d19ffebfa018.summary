by @entity0 published : 14:06 est , 9 july 2012 updated : 12:41 est , 10 july 2012 @entity1 is back with a brand new series of @entity3 and @entity5 's @entity4			1
the judging panel has been refreshed with two new faces , @entity10 model @entity8 , and @entity12 male supermodel @entity11 , who join @entity13 and outspoken @entity15 designer @entity14 for this eighth series			1
the 20 finalists were selected from auditions across the country for their model potential and what @entity21 have dubbed ' fashion fierceness '			1
the girls this year are the strongest yet , says @entity14			1
' i think this is the best selection of young girls we ’ve ever had			1
they are energetic and they capture the essence of the look at the moment and of what is going on in fashion , youth culture and modelling			0
i do n’t know who will win but i think they will be the best winner we ’ve had , with the most potential			0
' top row , from left to right : @entity44 , 18 ; @entity45 , 18 ; @entity46 , 19 ; @entity47 , 22 ; @entity48 , 19 ; @entity49 , 20 ; @entity50 , 23 ; @entity51 , 19 ; @entity52 , 22 ; @entity53 , @entity55 row , from left to right : @entity56 , 19 ; @entity57 , 19 ; @entity58 , 22 ; @entity59 , 21 ; @entity60 , 22 ; @entity61 , 18 ; @entity62 , 19 ; @entity63 , 19 ; @entity64 , 19 ; @entity65 , 21 @entity13 agrees , saying this groups is the ' most skilled ' yet			0
' this particular bunch of girls has been the most skilled as far as modelling is concerned , ' @entity13 says			2
' we have seen girls start strong and get stronger , and we ’ve also seen girls start strong who have not been able to maintain it because looks only go so far			2
' @entity77 , stamina , sense of humour , courage , willingness to try new things , being flexible , reinventing themselves ... there are a lot of challenges for them			0
a gorgeous girl can come in and then leave in the first couple of episodes because she does n’t have that range			0
by the time they get to the last shows , these girls are really skilled			2
' and @entity13 says the brand new judging panel is a hit			1
' it ’s been absolutely amazing working with @entity8 , who is a great role model for my girls , ' she said			1
@entity11 is gorgeous and of course @entity99 ! he is on great form , he ’s fun and sexy and looks great			1
he ’s gorgeous , and thin , this year			0
i think the dynamics are really cool and fresh			0
we all have a different perspective on the business and the girls and we have different ways of giving feedback			2
' the judging panel , from left to right : @entity1 , @entity14 - who says this year 's girls are the ' best yet ' - @entity8 and @entity11 in tonight 's episode , the group will be in for a few surprises as @entity1 unleashes the unexpected on the nervous girls			1
the group meet at the @entity117 in @entity118 , where host @entity1 reveals their first challenge – a catwalk in front of @entity4 fans and members of the press , and of course , @entity13 herself			1
@entity13 says : ' i want to see your personalities , i want to understand who you are , your personal style			0
' some girls struggle with nerves in front of the crowd , while others work the catwalk and sparkle with model potential			1
but as @entity13 gathers the girls to give her opinion , she has a surprise in store : ' i do n’t think i ’ve seen the best of you all yet , so i really need the help of my fellow judges			2
now unfortunately they ’re not here at the moment , so i guess what we ’re going to have to do is go and join them			0
in @entity152 ! never before on @entity4 have we taken 20 girls on a trip , so you guys are really special ... i ’ll see you there			1
' but it 's not long before the claws come out , and the girls find themselves fighting soon after arriving in @entity152			1
personality clashes come to a head as the girls discuss their competition			2
@entity49 is singled out , with @entity62 voicing that she ' can not stand ' her			0
although others defend her , believing that ' she ’s just very confident , ' @entity52 adds that she finds her character to be ' very aggressive			0
' @entity45 concludes ' she ’s come here to win , not to make friends			0
' it 's just a taste of things to come as tensions will no doubt reach boiling point as the show unfolds			0
watch this space as we report on all the drama , from the highs and lows inside the house to the evictions and interviews with the girls			2
@entity3 and @entity5 's @entity4 airs tonight and every monday at 9pm @entity183 .			0
