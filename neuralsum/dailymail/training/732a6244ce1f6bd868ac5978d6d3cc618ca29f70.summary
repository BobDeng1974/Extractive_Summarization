@entity11 has never been one to hide his feelings and , as he began digesting an eye - catching scoreline , he was at his most colourful			2
a @entity16 victory over @entity17 had not been expected but there was nothing fortuitous about a 3 - 2 win , built on hard work and ruthlessness , which handed @entity11 his first success since being re-appointed to the managerial hot seat at @entity25			1
@entity4 scored his first goal for his new club in the 54th minute to put his side 2 - 1 up at @entity28 summer signing @entity4 is congratulated by his @entity16 after he bagged his side 's second goal @entity4 hugs team - mate @entity32 after netting his first competitive goal in @entity16 colours @entity35 was in buoyant mood after scoring his first @entity38 goal for the @entity16 @entity39 rushes to celebrate with @entity35 after the winger grabs his side 's third goal of the afternoon @entity43 had previously put his side 1 - 0 up thanks to a left - footed strike by the @entity17 forward @entity43 stares at the @entity17 crowd after putting his side in the lead during the opening exchanges of the @entity38 encounter @entity51 tried to round @entity16 goalkeeper @entity52 however the @entity54 custodian managed to save the @entity17 starlet 's effort @entity17 ( 4 - 2 - 1 - 3 ) : @entity57 5 : stones 5.5 ( @entity59 64mins 6.5 ) , @entity60 6 , @entity61 5.5 ( @entity62 83mins ) , @entity63 6.5 : @entity64 7 , @entity65 6 : @entity66 6 : @entity67 7 , @entity43 6 , @entity51 6.5 ( @entity68 64mins 6 ) unused : @entity69 ( gk ) , @entity62 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 goals - @entity43 9 , @entity63 83 @entity16 ( 4 - 5 - 1 ) : @entity52 7 : @entity74 7 , @entity75 6.5 , @entity76 7 , @entity77 7 : @entity39 8 , @entity78 7.5 ( @entity79 83mins ) , @entity80 8 , @entity32 7 , @entity81 8.5 : @entity4 7 unused : @entity82 ( gk ) , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 goals – jedinak 30 , @entity4 54 , @entity35 69 booked – @entity67 , @entity39 , @entity68 , @entity52 attendance – 37,574 referee – @entity92 @entity93 – @entity81 though @entity95 described @entity16 's statistics as ' spooky ' – three efforts on target led to three goals – to say they were lucky would be grossly unfair ; relentless in their running and committed in their approach , they took full advantage of @entity17 's miserable defending			1
from being in a position of strength thanks to @entity106 ’s ninth minute opener , @entity17 fell asunder as , first , a penalty from @entity80 , then a header from @entity4 and , finally , a smart finish from @entity81 – the game ’s outstanding player – put @entity16 in command			1
it left @entity11 hopping gleefully on the touchline , oblivious to the howls of the home support , who were so vexed by @entity17 ’s defending			1
days such as these are why he always felt there was one more job for him before retirement			0
‘ i thought we deserved to win it , i really did , ’ said @entity11			2
‘ in the first 20 minutes we probably gave them a bit too much respect			0
' but from then , we grew into the game and at half - time we said we should go and try and win it			0
’ such an outcome looked improbable when @entity60 popped a ball forward to @entity66 in the ninth minute ; he fed @entity43 and the @entity130 international finished smartly			0
had @entity66 then take a chance to double @entity17 ’s lead in the 29 minutes , it would have been a long way back for @entity16			1
but @entity16 hung in and @entity17 ’s downfall started in the next attack , when @entity136 and @entity57 made a hash of trying to thwart @entity78			1
instead of clearing their lines , @entity78 scampered on to a loose ball but was chopped down by @entity57			0
referee @entity92 had no hesitation pointing to the penalty spot			2
@entity80 did the rest , smashing in his kick from 12 yards – two goalkeepers would not have saved it ; @entity16 might have led at the break but @entity81 struck a post via a deflection from @entity150			1
@entity80 converted from the penalty spot to put his side on level terms during his side 's match at @entity28 @entity16 stars @entity4 , @entity32 and @entity78 embrace their skipper after he scores past @entity57 @entity4 joined the south @entity159 side in the summer after sealing a move away from @entity162 outfit @entity161 mins @entity163 @entity17 total 101.4 63.0 @entity66 90 11.3 7.0 @entity65 90 10.6 6.6 @entity64 90 10.1 6.3 @entity16 total 105.5 65.6 @entity32 90 11.2 7.0 @entity78 90 10.8 6.7 @entity80 90 10.5 6.5 data courtesy of the @entity165 , the @entity166 of the @entity38 no matter			1
in the 54th minute when @entity74 bombed forward and hoisted in a cross to the back post that looked set to be comfortably gathered by @entity57 but , instead , he dropped the ball and presented @entity4 with a simple header			2
frustration swirled around @entity28 and worse was to follow when @entity66 dithered , allowing @entity39 to pick his pocket and the winger fed @entity81 , who kept his calm and rolled a right - foot finish under @entity57 ’s flailing dive			2
@entity63 ’ penalty was just a consolation			2
‘ team like us can go and give a good account of themselves , ’ said @entity11			0
‘ look at ( the results of ) @entity186 and @entity187			0
i just feel it is wide open			0
but this just gives everyone a lift , does n’t it ? ' we had to make headers and blocks at the end			0
but i like that kind of football			0
’ and he certainly was n’t afraid to show it			0
@entity80 pursues @entity17 midfielder @entity66 as @entity16 kept up the pressure on the @entity17 ' midfield @entity35 stole the show at @entity28 to inspire his side to victory in the blue half of @entity206 @entity84 , pictured with @entity17 's @entity62 , came off the bench to make a late appearance for the south @entity159 outfit @entity63 scored a late penalty against @entity16 but it proved to be nothing more than a late consolation goal @entity17 left back @entity63 netted from 12 yards to score past @entity52 with seven minutes left on the club @entity95 lost out in his tactical battle with @entity16 manager @entity11 jedinak and @entity52 salute @entity16 's travelling fans after picking up all three points against @entity17 goalscoring hero @entity35 applauds the @entity16 fans after the final whistle @entity16 's travelling support sung their hearts out to inspire their side to victory against the @entity17 @entity11 shakes hands with @entity17 defender @entity60 - a player he managed during his time at @entity225			1

the @entity16 came away from @entity28 with all three points as @entity11 claimed his first win since taking back over the reins at @entity25
@entity106 opened the scoring after just nine minutes , only for @entity80 to level the scoring from the spot
@entity4 then netted his first goal for @entity16 before winger @entity35 grabbed his first @entity38 goal
@entity63 scored a late penalty for @entity17 however it proved to be nothing more than a consolation goal
