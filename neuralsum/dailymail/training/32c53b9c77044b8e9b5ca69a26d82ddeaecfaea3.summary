by @entity0 published : 18:25 est , 8 january 2014 updated : 18:25 est , 8 january 2014 help : treasury minister @entity2 , pictured , hinted a minimum wage rise would soon be given the green light the cost to businesses of a big hike in the minimum wage would be offset with tax breaks under plans being drawn up by conservative ministers			1
further cuts to corporation tax or an increase in national insurance relief could help firms contend with an expected rise in the minimum pay rate			2
business leaders broadly back raising the rate , but say it could be hard to implement			2
treasury minister @entity2 yesterday gave a clear signal that the move , designed to help struggling workers reap the rewards of @entity27 ’s economic recovery , is likely to be given the green light			1
the minimum wage is £ 6.31 for over- 21s , but in real terms it is now worth the same as in 2004 – and is about ten per cent lower than 2008			1
analysis for @entity33 suggests hiking the minimum pay rate by 50p an hour would also save the government as much as £ 1billion , because people in work would pay more tax and claim less in benefits			1
independent advisers have been asked to look at restoring the value of the rate , which has been undermined since the crash of 2008 and 2009			2
mr @entity2 told the @entity46 ’s @entity45 programme that there was a strong case for a rise			2
‘ @entity50 has asked the @entity51 to look into this			0
they ’re going to report back shortly and we ’ll see what they come up with , ’ he said			0
‘ it [ the minimum wage ] is about 10 per cent lower in real terms than where it was in 2008			1
i think that ’s a strong case to look at it			0
' the important thing is that the right people to look at this decision are the @entity51			0
’ squeezed : in real terms minimum wage is now worth the same as in 2004 - and is about ten per cent lower than 2008 international development secretary @entity65 said : ‘ one of the things we tried to do is support hard - working people , it ’s been one of the key planks of our long - term economic plan			1
‘ we ’ve supported the minimum wage and actually it ’s looked at by the @entity51 , so there ’s been an independent body that ’s looked at that – i think that ’s the right thing to do			1
international development secretary @entity65 said a minimum wage rise was key plank in a long - term economic plan ‘ but i think we ’ve been very clear as a government that we want to see work pay			1
‘ i think we ’ve absolutely targeted our help on the people on the lowest incomes			0
’ conservative mp @entity88 , who led a successful campaign to persuade the chancellor to freeze fuel duty until 2015 , said : ‘ although i would like to see it increase with the current level of inflation , i recognise that a significant rise could put jobs at risk , as many small businesses would be unable to afford a rise			0
' i believe it is important that we look at the other ways of giving people a living wage , namely cutting people ’s taxes and letting them keep more of their salary			0
’ @entity107 , national chairman of the @entity108 , said : ‘ with confidence returning to most sectors , it makes sense to look at increasing the minimum wage			2
‘ however , we would urge the government to tread carefully			0
in some industries , such as retail and social care , small businesses operate very fine margins and are struggling with rising costs			0
‘ it is for this reason we have argued that any increase in the national minimum wage this year should not exceed the rate of inflation			1
’ the commission ’s report is due to be handed to ministers at the end of next month .			0
