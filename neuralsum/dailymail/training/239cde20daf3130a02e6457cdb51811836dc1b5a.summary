the seemingly endless run of clear blue skies that left @entity11 basking in tropical sunshine is over , according to forecasters , to be replaced by a mixture of scattered rain and sunny spells			1
while the mercury may not top this year ’s high of @entity20 ( @entity21 ) or match the baking conditions in mainland @entity23 , it will still be pleasant for millions choosing a staycation			2

@entity35 , sprout technical advisor			2
