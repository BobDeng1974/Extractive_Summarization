by @entity0 published : 12:41 est , 14 november 2013 updated : 12:45 est , 14 november 2013 since the 1800s , populations around the world have grown six fold causing a rapid expansion of cities and towns			2
to plot the extent at which some of these cities have grown , cartographers created colourful and striking maps showing the age of every building in certain countries			1
properties in @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and its borough @entity20 have been colour coded to not only show how populations have expanded , but also highlight the places within those cities that are still growing			1
the colours in the @entity25 map , pictured , appear to spread outwards from the centre of the @entity28 city in ripples			1
the oldest buildings are plotted around this centre and date back to the 15th century and much of the architecture that was built before the revolution remains largely untouched the colours in the houses of @entity16 map , for example , appear to spread outwards from the centre of the @entity28 city in ripples , resembling how bacteria multiplies in a petri dish			1
the oldest buildings are plotted around the centre , dating all the way back to the 15th century and much of the architecture that was built before the revolution remains largely untouched			0
as the map is zoomed out , the newer developments sit predominantly on the outskirts of the city			2
houses of @entity16 , created by @entity28 ’s @entity49 , lists six historical @entity51 map covers pre-revolutionary @entity28 , and then @entity28 under @entity52 and the @entity53 ( 1922 to 1952 ) , @entity54 ( 1958 to 1964 ) , @entity55 ( 1964 to 1982 ) , @entity56 ( 1982 to 1984 ) , @entity57 ( 1984 to 1985 ) , @entity58 ( 1988 to 1991 ) and @entity59 ( 1992 to 2010 )			1
the @entity17 map , pictured , shows the age of the building in @entity64 ’s capital city			1
it was created by cartographer @entity66			0
the dark brown buildings dates back to before 1900 , while the whiter buildings were built from 1995 onwards the age of @entity71 map shows the age of the buildings in @entity64 ’s capital city			1
this map , created by cartographer @entity66 , is n’t as colourful as the @entity75 one ; instead the darker the brown colour of the buildings , the older they are			1
dark brown buildings date back to before 1900 , while the whiter buildings were built from 1995 onwards			0
@entity66 ’s map has a sci - fi feel to its colour scheme , caused in part by the city ’s layout , and the map has similarities with main viewer screen from the @entity90 series			2
users can hover their mouse over any of the buildings on any of these maps to view their precise addresses and age			0
in @entity18 there are two maps that plot the age of its buildings			1
the @entity18 map , including the five boroughs of @entity20 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 , was designed and created by website @entity107			1
the @entity18 map , pictured , including the five boroughs of @entity20 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 , was designed and created by website @entity107			1
there are a total of 1,053,713 buildings on a colour range of pink to yellow , dating from 1830 to 1995 onwards there are a total of 1,053,713 buildings on a colour range of pink to yellow , dating from 1830 to 1995 onwards			0
unlike @entity16 and @entity120 , @entity18 is a much newer city in terms of architecture			1
few buildings remain that date back to the 19th century but one of the oldest properties is shown as 67 @entity127 , built in 1765			0
this is the @entity129 located in the historic district in @entity131			0
the district consists of 49 rowhouses and apartment buildings built between 1882 and 1909			0
many of the buildings are made of wood or brick rowhouses in the @entity139 and romanesque styles			0
other older buildings can also be found in @entity142 as well as along the @entity143 in @entity103			0
alternatively , people interested in seeing the ages of buildings in just @entity20 can use the @entity148 map			2
this map covers buildings built in 1825 , shown in blue , up to buildings built since 2000 , shown in dark red			0
properties in @entity20 appear to be more evenly spread in terms of age , but the predominant colour is yellow , and this indicates houses built at the start of the 20th century			2
the newest developments are found in the north and east of the borough including @entity163 and its shopping mall , dating back to 2001 , and 5502 @entity165 built in 2010			0
both the @entity18 and @entity20 maps were built using @entity18 ’s @entity168 data from @entity169 .			2

colourful maps plot the different ages of buildings across @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity20
*individual* buildings are colour coded making it possible to see expansion of these cities at a *glance*
the @entity28 houses of @entity16 map shows developments growing outwards from the city centre
few properties from the 1800s remain in @entity18 , while @entity17 has a *broader* *mix* of older and newer properties
all the maps were created using open *source* data and age information
