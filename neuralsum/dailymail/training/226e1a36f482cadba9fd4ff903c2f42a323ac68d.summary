one in five single mothers fall into poverty in the wake of a relationship break - up , research suggests one in five single mothers fall into poverty in the wake of a break - up , new research suggests			1
the study by the @entity10 at the @entity11 found that women and children are those who are hit the hardest following the breakdown of a relationship			2
researchers , who analysed data from the @entity18 between 1991 and 2008 , also found that 19 per cent of children fall into relative poverty after their parents split			2
the study also found that mental health and life satisfaction declines for both men and women in the wake of a split			1
however , while they return to pre-split levels in the short - term , women are left struggling in the long - term with income and living standards			1
the study , funded by the @entity35 , found that on average , it takes two to three years for a woman ’s household income to return to its pre-split levels			0
in comparison , on average , a man ’s income rises by around 80 per cent at the time of a split and never falls back to pre-split levels			0
women 's income is usually helped by meeting a new partner , the study found			2
the study ’s authors , professor @entity52 and dr @entity53 , said : ‘ women and dependent children , on average , see living standards fall more than men after a split			1
‘ these changes are much greater for those women and children from formerly high - income couples , because the loss of the man ’s earnings is in no way compensated for by higher income from alimony , child maintenance , benefits and tax credits , and having fewer mouths to feed			2
‘ our research suggests that partnership dissolution has relatively short - term adverse impacts on mental distress and subjective well - being , but can have long - term negative consequences for income and living standards			1
’ @entity80 , chief executive of @entity81 – a charity providing advice and support to single parents – said the government must ensure that the number of single parents struggling does n’t fall any lower			0
both men and women experience a decline in mental health and life satisfaction in the wake of a break - up but while these return to pre-split levels in the short - term , women are left with lower income and living standards she told @entity102 : ‘ this research chimes with what many of the single parents we work with tell us every day : that they are really struggling to pay essential bills and put food on the table			1
she said that fewer than two in five of single parents – of whom nine out of 10 are mothers – received maintenance from their child ’s other parent , something which she said needed to be addressed urgently			0
‘ the government must ensure the changes it is making to the child maintenance system do n’t see this figure fall even lower , ’ she added			0
the government is currently examining whether family breakdown should be considered when measuring child poverty			0
a child is deemed as living in poverty if the family household income is less than 60 per cent of the average wage .			0
