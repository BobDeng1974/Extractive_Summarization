election plan : @entity1 will today launch the six key themes of his party ’s pitch to voters in may @entity6 will not feature at the heart of the @entity9 election manifesto even though it is voters ’ top concern , it emerged last night			1
@entity1 will today launch the six key themes of his party ’s pitch to the voters in may , saying they will be the deficit , jobs , taxes , education , housing and retirement			1
but immigration , @entity22 and the @entity23 are conspicuous by their absence			1
this is despite the fact that last month pollsters revealed immigration is now consistently the most important political issue of concern to voters			1
@entity33 said that since may 2014 , people have in every month put it above or tied with the economy			2
the issue of immigration remains sensitive for the @entity39 , who have failed on deliver on their 2010 pledge to cut net immigration to the ‘ tens of thousands ’ every year thanks largely to an influx of workers from the @entity47			2
net migration is currently running at 260,000 , according to official figures published last month			0
@entity51 ’s @entity50 is still polling about 13 per cent and now has two mps following the defections of @entity54 and @entity55 to the @entity39			2
and critics will point out that the absence of the @entity23 is no coincidence given that it is currently going through an @entity60 crisis			1
it remains a core @entity63 issue and one on which @entity65 feels he can still score points			0
last night the @entity9 said that although immigration and the @entity23 are not due to be manifesto themes , it would be wrong to say they are being ‘ ignored ’			1
tackling immigration is a key plank of the party ’s long - term economic plan , a source said			1
mr @entity1 will launch his party ’s themes in a speech this morning – concentrating on tackling the deficit			1
the inclusion of the deficit as his first key theme contrasts with the way mr @entity65 forgot to mention the issue at all in his conference speech last year			1
the prime minister will say that parents must ‘ look at the children they love ’ and decide whether they should be saddled with the huge debts that he claims a @entity63 government would entail			0
latest polling shows that voters name the economy , health and pensions as the key issues facing them and their family , with immigration a key concern for the country slip - up : the inclusion of the deficit as his first key theme contrasts with the way mr @entity65 forgot to mention the issue at all in his conference speech last year he will insist the @entity108 of the future must live within its means – and will warn that if it does not , the country would be on the ‘ road to ruin ’			1
he will warn that a @entity63 victory could leave the @entity108 with a ‘ mountain of debt ’ to the next generation that they could ‘ never hope to re-pay ’			0
‘ this is n’t just about the straightforward economic arguments , ’ he will say			0
‘ it is about the values of this country – whether we as a nation are going to pass on a mountain of debt to the next generations that they could never hope to repay			0
‘ i say we have a responsibility to act			0
we can get @entity108 back to living within our means in a way that is fair and sensible and secure			0
’ he will say that dealing with the deficit is crucial to make sure the @entity108 can carry on investing in hospitals , schools and strong public services – and cope with future shocks in the global economy			2
‘ this means @entity108 will have to run a surplus so that we start paying down our debts and keep our economy secure , reduce spending and cut out waste instead of increasing taxes on working people , control the welfare budget to save money and reward work , crack down on tax avoidance and ensure those who can afford to pay the most do , and continue to increase spending on the @entity23			1
‘ with the other parties , all you get is confusion ; un-costed plans ; the spectre of more debt			0
yesterday chancellor @entity157 ( r ) claimed @entity63 was planning a ‘ tax bombshell ’ equivalent to 3p on income tax or three percentage points on @entity158 ‘ with the @entity9 , you get the opposite : a strong and competent team , a proven record , and a long - term economic plan that is turning our country around			0
’ yesterday chancellor @entity157 claimed @entity63 was planning a ‘ tax bombshell ’ equivalent to 3p on income tax or three percentage points on @entity158			0
in an interview yesterday , mr @entity65 repeatedly refused to say how much of the savings needed to tackle the deficit would come from cuts to public services and how much would come from tax rises			2
mr @entity157 claimed that @entity63 will be forced to put up taxes because it will not match his pledge to deliver the £ 30billion fiscal consolidation needed to eliminate the deficit through spending cuts and welfare reductions alone			1
the chancellor told @entity184 any party rejecting his plan to balance the books purely through cuts was ‘ either offering the country a tax bombshell or a borrowing bombshell or both ’			2
he has asked mr @entity65 to make clear whether he is planning £ 15billion worth of tax hikes .			0
