there are obvious difficulties in wearing a blanket in the street			1
for example , a few days ago i met a very fashionable person wrapped in one in the country , and was not alone in assuming she was recuperating from something nasty			0
or , at worst , people might think you ’d slept in a doorway and got up to stretch your legs			1
however , absurd as it sounds , the blanket ( or poncho , drape , cape , wrap , maxi scarf or whatever you want to call it ) is having a moment			1
@entity22 ’s , thick , 15 per cent cashmere , 85 per cent wool blankets in yellow , blue and red — and costing nearly £ 900 — were the toast of their autumn / winter show this year , and looked rather fetching ( not a hard task , admittedly ) on @entity30 and @entity31			1
to someone like me who loves their bed and hates getting out of it , wandering around draped in a blanket is a good halfway house			2
there are drawbacks , however : with no toggles anywhere , they can slide off ; you ca n’t run in them , and you have to drink coffee extremely carefully , in case your blanket slips off , taking your mug with it			1
it ’s easy to wear , with no special wrapping required — and as it ’s knitted , its weight stops it from sliding off			0
you could tie it at the front if you needed your hands free			0
i looked a little like a tarot - card reader , but it ’s pretty , and either bohemian or dressy depending what you wear it with			0
beat the chills check wool and cashmere blanket , £ 895 , burberry.com the original @entity22 masterpiece that kicked off the blanket trend			1
this does feel very expensive , which is lucky because it is			0
it ’s very thick — perhaps overly so for a transitional autumn day , but wonderful on a chilly , breezy one			2
as it ’s heavy , it stays on better than most			0
stylish checks blanket , £ 25 , ikea.com the utilitarian option			1
i have to admit that when draped by a stylist — i certainly could n’t manage to make it look stylish myself — you might think this was designed for a person rather than a sofa			2
but it feels rough and scratchy			0
i got the sense that if i lay down in a @entity107 park , people might start parking their flasks and sandwiches on my back ! @entity112 colours @entity114 block poncho , £ 129 , jigsaw - online.com @entity116 ’s attempt is made of lovely fabric , with rough , blankety edges , and it ’s in strong colours just like the @entity22 one			1
however , there ’s so much of it you could set up camp in it , so careful draping is required			0
i would n’t wear this one anywhere near an escalator			2
warm and @entity129 stripe blanket cape , £ 25 , @entity131 tasselled and , washable , this grey - and - white blanket goes with anything and is very easy to wear because it ’s thin enough to be flexible , thick enough to be warm , cosy as afternoon tea and incredibly comforting ; i did n’t want to take it off			1
in fact , i did n’t take it off for hours			0
but you do have to part company with it when drinking coffee , or you ’re asking for trouble .			0

@entity145 and @entity30 have both modelled blanket capes for @entity22 but are they acceptable outerwear ?
the blanket is having a moment , despite the *potential* for looking like you are *recovering* from illness or have slept on the street
@entity22 *'s* £ 900 cashmere and wool cape were the toast of their autumn / winter show
they can slide off , you ca n’t run in them , and you have to drink coffee extremely carefully
