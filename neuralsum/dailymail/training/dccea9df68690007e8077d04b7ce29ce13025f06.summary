@entity0 has accused the @entity2 media of attempting to destabilise @entity3 following the latest rumours linking him with a move away from the team			1
earlier this week it was reported @entity0 and @entity9 would swap teams for next season , despite the former having another two years remaining on his contract , whilst the latter has an additional year with @entity14			1
@entity0 is clearly becoming exasperated at the need to constantly fend off questions on the subject of whether he will leave @entity3 , more so than the team 's lack of results as he is now without a win for 27 races , a statistic that often fuels the rumours regarding a potential departure			1
@entity0 is committed to staying at @entity3 the two - time world champion wonders around the paddock at the @entity29 @entity28 asked to clarify the situation ahead of sunday 's @entity31 , @entity0 said : ' i 've been commenting about my future for 13 months now - since last august - so i have nothing new to say			1
' sometimes it 's sad when it comes from @entity2 , or they create these rumours for some strange purpose which is not helping @entity3 , which is why we 're all here			1
' @entity3 is a much bigger brand than any individual person , or even @entity28 in general			2
' i respect @entity3 a lot and i try to create a good atmosphere in the team with the guys - from going out to dinner to playing basketball , playing poker , whatever - to ensure we are united			0
' it 's what we need , and it 's what people expect from us driving for @entity3 and working for @entity3			2
' so when all these things come from @entity2 , it 's not really clear what the purpose is			2
when we know then one day i will tell you			0
' @entity0 's frustration is matched by @entity9 , especially this season now he is on the back foot after four years of title glory			1
@entity0 retires from the @entity2 @entity28 at @entity62 earlier this month @entity9 has reiterated his desire to stay at @entity14 the @entity65 world champion flies around the track at @entity62 giving short shrift to the interviewer when quizzed on his future , @entity9 said : ' i 'm not thinking any differently to when i was asked the question a couple of weeks ago			1
' i have a contract , and nothing has changed			0
the relationship i have with @entity14 is very special as they 've been supporting me since i was 12 years old			0
' back then it was impossible to predict what would happen , that one day they would have their own team , or two @entity28 teams			0
' it was impossible to know i would be driving for one of them at some stage , or both of them			0
' so it 's impossible to predict the future			0
i 've been with @entity14 a long time , i have a strong link to them , so in that regard nothing has changed , and does n't look like it will change			0
