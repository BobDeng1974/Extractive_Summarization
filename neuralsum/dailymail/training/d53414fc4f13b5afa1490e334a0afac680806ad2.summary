@entity1 viewers will miss the first 15 minutes of saturday 's game due to broadcasting regulations			1
he 's done it before can he do it again ? no , not that … the goal on the comeback or on the debut			0
@entity10 will combine his debut and his comeback this saturday and he will do it in the biggest fixture in world football – @entity15			2
@entity17 supporters are hopeful the precedent of last season will mean he makes an instant impact on his return to competitive action			0
after serving his 10 - game ban for biting @entity24 , @entity10 scored twice in his first match back			1
video : scroll down to see @entity17 back in training ahead of their @entity29 clash @entity30 gets a lift from @entity10 ( second right ) and his @entity34 team - mates at training on thursday @entity10 shares a joke with @entity38 star @entity37 ( left ) at @entity17 training during the week @entity40 ( right ) has played in a deeper role this season with @entity10 set to play on the right of the front three saturday 's game at the @entity46 could be the first time @entity10 , @entity37 and @entity40 are deployed together how @entity17 may line up against @entity48 that afternoon a @entity50 side still reeling from the mismanagement of @entity52 and under the temporary stewardship of @entity54 were the opponents			1
it was n't the @entity50 team beaten by eight goals by @entity60 's @entity59 , it was an even worse version and @entity10 took full advantage			2
he tapped in a @entity63 cross in the first half and lifted his shirt to reveal the words ' @entity66 ' to mark the birth of his son @entity69			0
so confident was he of scoring again he wore a different ' welcome @entity66 ' shirt under his @entity72 shirt in the second half and duly scored again from another @entity63 assist			2
one of the advantages for him that day was that although he was coming back from a long lay - off he was returning to very familiar surroundings			0
he had built - up a good understanding with @entity63 and when the @entity80 got going again , it was as if @entity10 had never been away			2
that will not be the case this time			0
@entity83 is a fledgling threesome and apart from training sessions , there has been no opportunity for @entity17 to play @entity10 , @entity37 and @entity40 together			1
what they have been able to do however is ensure that the system employed by the team fits perfectly with the incoming @entity10			0
@entity40 has played ever so slightly deeper and whoever has played on the right of the front three , where @entity10 can expect to be used if he starts the game , has been given license to run into the centre - forward territory which will suit the @entity97 perfectly			1
@entity10 wore two different ' welcome @entity66 ' shirts to mark the birth of his son against @entity50 in 2013 after serving his 10 - game ban for biting @entity24 , @entity10 scored twice against the @entity50 @entity10 will return to competitive action on saturday for the first time since biting @entity105 ( left ) @entity10 formed a lethal partnership with fellow @entity72 striker @entity63 ( right ) last season the omen of the brace on his comeback is not the only precedent that @entity34 fans are hanging on to			1
@entity10 also has a habit of scoring on his debut			0
he scored on his league debut and his home debut for @entity117 and he hit the back of the net against @entity120 on his first @entity72 outing			1
he came off the bench on 63 minutes and had notched by minute 79			0
@entity123 and @entity124 were his fellow strikers in the those early weeks at @entity126			0
