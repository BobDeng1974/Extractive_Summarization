@entity2 's @entity1 headset maker @entity3 is getting into movies with an in - house studio dedicated to making virtual - reality films			1
the firm has hired staff from @entity9 , the animation studio behind films including ' @entity11 ' and ' @entity12 , ' and and highly respected computer games firm @entity14 for the new @entity16 unit			2
it will show its first short movie at the @entity19 on monday , the company said			1
@entity3 will debut the short film ' @entity21 ' at @entity19 , which the in - house studio developed over the past six months			1
' lost ' is designed to be interactive and is between 4 and 10 minutes long , depending on the viewer 's interactive choices			2
' we felt the 360 - side of filmmaking has been covered , ' @entity3 ceo @entity29 told the @entity32 ' , referring to live - action cinema			1
' what has n't been explored is the animated side			2
' the movies will be made exclusively for @entity3 ' @entity1 platform and will not come in a traditional 2 - @entity39 format , @entity29 said			1
@entity1 allows for a larger degree of interactivity than traditional cinema - paths can be explored and characters may materialize depending on where a viewer chooses to look			2
the group of roughly 10 people includes several veterans of @entity9 and @entity49 , including @entity50 , the creative director , a former cinematographer at @entity9 , and @entity53 , a supervising technical director and another @entity9 veteran			0
the @entity56 will develop film content for virtual reality and advise other filmmakers seeking to try the technology			0
@entity2 bought @entity3 last year for $ 2 billion			1
so far the business has largely focused on video games for its pioneering wrap - around @entity64 headset			0
but virtual reality has recently been enticing @entity67 's filmmakers to expand into the 360 - degree panoramic view offered by headsets			0
at the annual @entity19 in @entity70 , @entity71 , part of the event has been dedicated to virtual - reality short movies by filmmakers including @entity77 and @entity78 , to draw the independent film community			1
@entity3 ' @entity16 will develop film content for virtual reality and advise otherfilmmakers seeking to try the technology			1
' i think the ( film ) community has done a really good job about getting excited about @entity1 and starting to work on things in @entity1 , ' said @entity3 chief executive officer @entity29			1
@entity3 also hopes to explore @entity1 film experiences in real time , which would allow viewers to interact inside the headset with objects and characters , he said			1
' this is really tuning in to what a lot of people who are extending 360 - degree film into @entity1 can not do yet			0
it 's getting into the heart and soul and magic of @entity1			0
' @entity3 will debut the short film ' @entity21 ' at @entity19 , which the in - house studio developed over the past six months			1
' lost ' is designed to be interactive and is between 4 and 10 minutes long , depending on the viewer 's interactive choices			0
the firm has hired staff from @entity9 , the animation studio behindfilms including ' @entity108 , ' and ' up ' ( pictured ) but virtual - reality films are still a long way from becoming mainstream as the headsets to display them have yet to reach the mass market			0
while @entity117 offers its @entity1 headset with its @entity120 smartphone and @entity121 has its @entity123 device to use with smartphones , the consumer version of @entity3 ' @entity64 headset is still in development			2
there are also technological and creative constraints to developing film in virtual reality , said @entity50 , a @entity9 veteran who is now creative director of @entity56			0
challenges include computers running too slowly to handle the intensive rendering of graphics in real time , as well as how to find a format for storytelling in a 360 - degree environment where the viewer can look anywhere			0
' film has very linear storytelling , it 's one - dimensional , ' @entity50 said			0
' in @entity1 , you need to find a three - dimensional way of telling the story where the space around you matters			0

movies will be made exclusively for @entity3 ' *vr* platform
will show its first short movie at the @entity19 on monday
