@entity0 has backed @entity1 and @entity2 to take the @entity3 by storm			1
@entity1 will miss a third successive game for @entity6 on sunday due to a groin problem , although @entity0 is sure the @entity8 forward will be fit enough to go to the @entity3			1
but while @entity1 is a household name opposition teams will be well aware of , @entity2 is something of an unknown threat			2
the midfielder only pledged his allegiance to @entity21 - the country of his birth - last @entity22 used @entity2 sparingly towards the end of his tenure as @entity6 boss as he feared the teenager would break down due to exhaustion			1
but @entity0 has no qualms about @entity2 heading to @entity15 with his new international team - mates this summer			1
' @entity2 is the kind of player who could light up a @entity3 , whether that is starting games or off the bench , ' said the @entity6 interim player - manager , who started @entity2 in the 3 - 1 win over @entity38 on tuesday			1
decision made : @entity2 ( left ) pledged his allegiance to @entity21 , the country of his birth , last month ' i was excited when he got the ball the other night - when i was on the pitch and on the bench			2
' he floats with the ball effortlessly			0
he is just one of those players you love watching			0
' @entity21 are outsiders in the running for @entity3 glory , but with the likes of @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity2 and @entity56 among their ranks , they have the potential to reach at least the quarter - finals			1
@entity8 will hope to reach that stage in the tournament too			2
and they will rely heavily on @entity1 to get there			0
@entity1 is @entity8 's most dangerous player			1
his power , pace and eye for goal will worry @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 , who make up @entity73 danger man : @entity1 will lead @entity8 's attack at the @entity3 in @entity15 this summer but the fact remains that the 28 - year - old has yet to live up to his billing on the global @entity80 's previous two @entity3 campaigns have been hampered by injury , and hie best international tournament came 10 years ago , when he burst onto the scene at @entity84			1
@entity0 is sure @entity1 can be a leading star for @entity8 this summer though			1
' @entity1 is at the peak of his powers , ' said @entity0 , who has played alongside @entity1 for 10 years			1
' @entity1 is a top player			0
he is at a good age			0
' i know for a fact he ca n't wait for it			0
' he has had a fantastic season and he is ready to make an impact			0
' team - mates : @entity0 ( left ) has backed fellow @entity6 player @entity1 to be a leading star for @entity8 @entity1 broke a metatarsal in april 2006 , limiting his impact at the @entity3 in @entity97 and four years later he suffered an ankle injury just before the tournament in @entity100			1
the former @entity102 striker recently had a spell out with a toe injury and he now has a groin complaint			0
the injury will not stop the striker scoring goals at the @entity3 , according to @entity0 , who is also confident that @entity108 will be named in @entity109 's 23 on monday despite a shoulder injury			1
' @entity1 will be fine for the @entity3 , ' @entity0 said			1
' it was just a little groin strain			0
he has done all the work in the gym			0
he is going away next week and working on his fitness as well so it has probably helped him			0
dejection : @entity1 struggled for @entity8 in @entity100 in 2010 after suffering an ankle injury ' the injury has probably done him a favour			2
' sunday 's trip to @entity122 will be @entity0 ' final game in charge of @entity6			2
when asked whether his short reign had given him more of an appetite for a career in management , @entity0 said : ' yes			2
' sometimes you probably think i could do without it and other times it gives you so much pleasure			0
' it has definitely helped me prepare for what will come after my playing career			0
' keen for more : @entity0 says his reign as interim manager has given him an appetite for a career in management @entity0 remains undecided on what he will do next year			1
he would like to be @entity6 manager one day , but he does not hold it against the board for looking to appoint a more experienced candidate this summer , like @entity148 , who could be appointed next week			2
' there is no major disappointment , ' @entity0 said			0
' i have plenty of time ( to manage )			0

the @entity6 interim manager says @entity21 's @entity2 could light up the @entity3 in @entity15 this summer
@entity0 reckons @entity1 can shine for @entity8 this summer with the striker at the ' peak of his powers '
@entity0 agrees his spell as interim manager has given him an appetite for a career in management
