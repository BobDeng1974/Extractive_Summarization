on the eve of the tenth regular season game on these shores , the @entity0 continues to aggressively export its product			1
and it is an @entity5 , @entity6 , at the heart of the sport ’s international growth			1
@entity6 , the @entity0 ’s executive vice president international , says the process is nearing critical mass. ‘ i always said when we started this in 2007 that i felt that this was a 15 - year project to assess seriously and robustly what we could accomplish in that marketplace			1
and i feel we ’re half way down that path			0
’ the @entity0 are set on @entity19 becoming a home from home across the @entity22 by the 2022 season 2007 - october 28 , @entity24 : 81,176 @entity25 13 - 10 @entity26 2008 - october 26 , @entity24 : 83,226 @entity27 32 - 37 @entity28 2009 - october 25 , @entity24 : 84,254 @entity29 patriots 35 - 7 @entity30 2010 - october 31 , @entity24 : 83,941 @entity31 16 - 24 @entity32 49ers 2011 october 23 , att : 76,981 @entity33 24 - 18 @entity30 2012 - october 28 , @entity24 : 84,004 @entity29 45 - 7 @entity34 2013 - september 29 , @entity24 : 83,518 @entity35 27 - 34 @entity36 october 27 , @entity24 : 83,559 @entity32 42 - 10 @entity37 2014 - september 28 @entity26 38 - 14 @entity38 as the @entity40 prepare to tackle the @entity41 at the national stadium on sunday , it seems no longer a question of if @entity44 gets a franchise , but when			1
but @entity46 has been crying out for a team since losing the @entity34 to @entity34 in 1995			0
alongside the @entity38 and the @entity27 , they are one of three clubs on year - to - year leases			1
and then there are the @entity37 , owned by @entity53 supremo @entity52 , who embark upon the second ' home ' game of their four - year deal at @entity19 against the @entity58 next month			1
the speculation and intrigue is intense			0
but @entity6 dismisses claims of a master plan			1
‘ one thing we ’ve always tried to avoid is determining an outcome and then trying to manage to that			0
as long as you keep growing the fanbase and you keep showing the level of fan support , then you ’ll get to the right answer , whether that ’s putting a team there , playing a season of games across multiple teams or two teams			1
i do n’t think we have a pre-conceived view			0
‘ i do know that the conversation of putting a team in @entity29 is much more real than it was seven years ago			0
’ there are no plans to make the jump from three to four games next season , with the @entity86 - which sees @entity19 host two games in late september - a major factor			1
the @entity40 touched down at @entity90 ahead of sunday 's game with the @entity41 the @entity19 turf following the @entity38 game ‘ that impacts for us , particularly on @entity19 availability and making sure that there ’s a playing surface that works well for @entity86 level as well for us and for @entity29 soccer			1
‘ so i think we will end up with a three - game schedule again			2
the difference i think will be that we will look to play two of those games back - to - back			1
’ the likes of the @entity107 , the @entity108 and the @entity35 have enormous fan bases and the chances of them giving up a home game to travel across the pond appear slim			2
‘ nothing is ever impossible , but the more passionate and loyal and strong your market is and your home field advantage is the more reluctant you are to give it up , ' @entity6 says			2
‘ i ’ll be honest as well , there are a whole number of teams whose leases do n’t allow them to give up a home game			2
if you think back to the development of stadiums in this country and i think probably in the @entity129 , a lot of those stadiums were publicly funded as well as privately funded			2
‘ and as part of the public funding was a commitment in the leases that the games that would be played would be played in those stadiums			2
‘ there are definitely a range of clubs for whom their current lease would not allow them to play a game outside of their home stadium			2
’ @entity144 scores the @entity26 ' second touchdown during their 38 - 14 victory over the @entity38 last month with three sell - out games this season , the @entity0 has never been more popular across the pond			1
but would players find it an attractive proposition ? @entity6 brushes off logistical concerns and the 50 per cent tax levy on foreign athletes , two often - touted stumbling blocks			1
‘ every time you do something for the first time you ’re going to encounter a number of issues , some of them real , some of them imaginary			0
even within the @entity167 the tax rate is different in different states			0
we ’ve crossed that a little in the @entity167 quite successfully			0
we do n’t have any issues there – players choose to play where they play			0
and again as we do the thinking on the @entity129 market and if we can put a team there , all those things need to be factored in			0
‘ the travel time , where their families would live , the cost of living , all of those will be part of the thinking we need to do if we ’re going to get to a solution that works			0
we ’re going to solve those issues			0
’ and once the @entity44 plan is in place , will the @entity0 explore new markets to continue its global growth ? ‘ we ’ve been very clear that our focus is always " let ’s get the @entity129 strategy up and running " , and when we feel good about where we are and what the next steps are we ’ll look at the next market			1
and @entity196 is an obvious next market , ' @entity6 explains			1
‘ i definitely want to look at @entity198			2
the stadium work they ’ve done is obviously very impressive			0
it has the logistical benefit of being on the same timezone as the @entity167			0
and so it solves a lot of the practical issues if we were able to play games there			0
' it ’s a long flight , which will obviously be considered as well , but having seen it for the @entity86 , we would be foolish not to look at it			0
’ will the @entity0 be flying down to @entity211 as part its continued commitment to grow the game across the globe ?			1

@entity5 @entity6 heads the @entity0 's international strategy
the @entity0 aim to have a franchise on these shores by the 2022 season
with one game a year from 2007 - 2012 , and two in 2013 , three regular season games will be played this this year - all sell - outs
and @entity6 says there will be three games next season , with two of them back - to - back
once the @entity44 plan is finalised , there are *ambitions* for the @entity0 to expand into @entity196 and @entity198
