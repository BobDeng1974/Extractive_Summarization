these neon waves may look supernatural , but they are created by one of nature ’s smallest creatures			1
millions of plankton glowed like fireflies to light up a @entity7 beach , enabling a photographer to capture this eerie spectacle			1
scientists believe the phenomenon is the result of plankton being disturbed , causing them to emit light though a complex chemical reaction			1
a haunting spectacle : millions of plankton were recently captured lighting up a @entity7 beach , enabling a photographer to capture the rare and eerie spectacle ( pictured )			2
scientists believe the phenomenon is the result of plankton being disturbed , causing them to emit light bioluminescence is the production and emission of light by a living organism			1
it occurs widely in marine vertebrates and invertebrates , as well as in some fungi and microorganisms such as phytoplankton			0
the word comes from the @entity40 ' bios ' for living and the @entity43 ' lumen ' for light			0
bioluminescence is a type of light energy produced by a chemical reaction			1
different types of animals use bioluminescence in different ways			0
deep sea squid use it for counter illumination camouflage so they match their environmental light , but @entity59 use it to lure prey with a light - up dangling appendage from their head that draws in smaller fish , which they can eat			2
fireflies use bioluminescence to attract mates by flashing their abdomens , while their larvae use it to repel predators			2
millipedes also glow to put predators off from eating them			0
@entity73 caught the ghostly scene at @entity75 on @entity77 's east coast where he watched the tiny organisms riding waves and being washed up on the beach , to create dazzling patterns in the water			1
@entity73 , of @entity83 , said the effect , called bioluminescence or cold light , looked like lightning in the water			1
‘ it ’s always at twilight , which is around 11pm at this time of year			0
‘ it 's more abundant in summer - i guess the warmer waters trigger it off and it 's always been an electric blue - though of varying shades and intensity			2
’ the photographer said he had seen the glowing plankton around six times in the last 12 to 18 months at @entity75			1
‘ you tend to see it at high tide and you need a bit of movement to stir up the plankton , ’ he said			1
‘ some displays are stronger than others but it 's incredible to watch			0
some friends of mine came down to swim in it last weekend - to get themselves lit up in the water - it was great fun			0
’ @entity73 said that sometimes the effect only affects a small area of water , while other times it stretches all along the coast			2
‘ when the waves break it almost looks like a lightning storm in the wave			0
when you walk on the pebbles at the water 's edge , the pebbles light up			0
‘ you could put your hand in the water and watch it light up , then see the glowing particles slipping through your fingers			0
’ dr @entity135 , a marine biologist at @entity137 's @entity136 , explained : ‘ the light is created by small organisms called plankton , which are producing this light through a complex chemical reaction			1
riding waves : @entity73 caught the ghostly scene at @entity75 on @entity77 's east coast where he watched the tiny organisms , riding waves ( pictured ) and being washed up on the beach , to create dazzling patterns in the water ‘ this whole process is known as bioluminescence			1
many organisms use very similar methods to produce light , including fish , jellyfish , squid and even fireflies			1
‘ it 's an example of how organisms have evolved complex responses to external stimulus			0
dr @entity135 said he had seen bioluminescence only twice in five years , but said that late spring and early summer are the best times to see the phenomenon			0
@entity167 occurs widely among some groups of animals , especially in the open sea and in insects			0
‘ most marine light - emission is in the blue and green light spectrum - the wavelengths that pass furthest through seawater , ’ he said			0
‘ however , some loose - jawed fish emit red and infrared light , and the genus @entity180 emits yellow light			2
‘ sometimes thousands of square miles of the ocean shine with the light of bioluminescent bacteria in the milky seas effect to watch			0
’ lightning bolt moment : @entity73 said the effect ( pictured ) called bioluminescence or cold light , looked like lightning in the water			1
he added that the phenomenon is seen at twilight at this time of year and is more abundant in the summer - perhaps because the water is slightly warmer an eerie view : marine biologist @entity135 said ' the light is created by small organisms called plankton , which are producing this light through a complex chemical reaction			1
this whole process is known as bioluminescence			0
many organisms use very similar methods to produce light , including fish , jellyfish , squid and even fireflies			1
' the glowing plankton can be seen on the rocks at the forefront of the picture			2

the glowing waves are created by plankton , which emit light like fireflies when they are disturbed
the phenomenon , called bioluminescence , was captured by a photographer at @entity75 on @entity77 's east coast
@entity73 said the glowing plankton can be seen at twilight in the summer , particularly at high tide
a marine biologist explained that the creatures emit light through a complex chemical reaction
fish , jellyfish , squid and fireflies use the same *technique* to glow in a bid to warn off predators - or *distract* them
