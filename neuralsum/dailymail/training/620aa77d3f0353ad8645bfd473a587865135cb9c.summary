@entity0 broke his silence but had not changed his tune , reiterating his belief that there is a campaign putting pressure on referees to treat @entity8 unfairly			1
the @entity9 offered some praise for the work of @entity13 officials but claimed they could be swayed by the media and other managers			1
@entity0 said he did n’t have a chance of successfully contesting an @entity18 charge for claiming there was a ‘ campaign ’ against @entity8 after they were denied a penalty in a 1 - 1 draw against @entity23 last month			1
‘ referees are not guilty , ’ he said			2
‘ they want to do their best but clearly there are measures and there are ways of reacting , and with my club and myself there are different standards			2
’ @entity0 drew on perceived examples , ranging from @entity51 not being given a stadium ban for pushing @entity0 at @entity53 to @entity54 not receiving protection from referees			1
‘ you could say hazard is a player with more fouls against him than anyone , ’ said @entity0 , ‘ @entity8 is the team with more attacks and shots and dominance , and with the fewest penalties			1
that is a big contradiction			0
‘ @entity58 is still the pure , naive boy he was as a kid			0
for him to go on the floor , it has to be nasty and he has no protection			0
’ @entity0 also refused to deny telling referee @entity29 he was ‘ too fat to referee and should retire ’ after @entity8 ’s 5 - 3 defeat at @entity32 on @entity73			1
but @entity0 focused his blame on the environment in which referees operate and said : ‘ for the players to express themselves they must feel no pressure			1
‘ with them ( referees ) it has to be exactly the same thing			0
they have to enjoy the matches			0
it is also important for them			0
@entity0 ( right ) talks to his support staff after @entity34 was booked for diving against @entity23 @entity34 was shocked after being denied a penalty and is instead booked for simulation @entity34 appears to be brought down by @entity23 's @entity91 during the match at @entity93 's @entity0 added his weight to calls for officials to be able to see live replays of incidents adding that he now felt ‘ worried ’ every time @entity8 play in a competition without goal line technology			1
‘ i want them to be able to see replays , ’ he said			0
‘ we can speak to them 30 minutes after the game , sometimes we go and the words are the normal ones : well done and so on			2
other times we discuss what happened			0
‘ with @entity29 , he made a big mistake and was not happy			2
i go in a privileged position because i have seen it on tv			0
