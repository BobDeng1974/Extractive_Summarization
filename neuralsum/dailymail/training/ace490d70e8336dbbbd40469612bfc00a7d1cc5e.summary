lt. @entity0 retired from the @entity1 as the second-most decorated soldier during @entity3 , earning four @entity4 , four @entity5 , seven @entity6 and the @entity7 after 28 straight months in combat			1
but despite backing from congressmen , senators , military veterans and historians , he never received the @entity13 , the nation 's highest military distinction , awarded for life - risking acts of valor above and beyond the call of duty			1
now a federal judge in @entity20 has ended his widow 's 17 - year quest to see that her husband received the prestigious medal posthumously			1
@entity25 lost : a @entity20 judge ruled that lt. @entity0 will not receive a @entity13 because his widow waited too long to try and amend her husband 's service record @entity31 district judge @entity30 ruled tuesday that a technicality will prevent @entity33 of @entity34 , @entity20 , from continuing her campaign on behalf of her husband , who died in november 1998 at age 79			1
@entity30 concluded that @entity33 waited too long to present new evidence to the @entity38 , which rejected her bid to alter her husband 's service record			1
@entity30 praised @entity0 's ' extraordinary courage and patriotic service , ' but said there was nothing he could do for the family			2
' dismissing this claim as required by technical limitations in no way diminishes lt. @entity0 's exemplary service and sacrifice , ' @entity30 wrote			1
@entity54 , a former @entity55 and amateur military historian who has researched @entity0 's service , said @entity0 deserves the @entity13			2
hero and heartthrob : @entity60 became the most decorated @entity31 soldier in @entity3 and went on to star in dozens of @entity63 films @entity54 vowed to get resolutions from lawmakers and veterans ' groups in all 50 states in an attempt to get @entity70 to act on @entity0 's behalf			1
' i want to make sure they ca n't walk away from this , ' @entity54 told @entity75 on wednesday			0
' he 's a man worthy of this			0
' roughly 3,400 people have received the @entity13 since it was created in 1861 , including actor @entity60 , the most decorated @entity31 soldier in @entity3 @entity60 fought in the same regions as @entity0 and went on to star in dozens of @entity63 films , most of them @entity80 and war flicks			1
@entity0 served with the @entity84 , which fought in @entity85 and @entity86 in 1945			0
the @entity1 in 2001 named @entity87 in @entity88 after @entity0			0
' he was a real hero , ' said attorney @entity89 of @entity90 , who represents @entity0 's family			2
@entity0 's citation for the @entity7 states that on january 24 , 1945 , near @entity93 , @entity85 , he slipped away from a military hospital with a hip wound to rejoin his unit rather than return home to @entity20			1
the wounded solider then unreeled a telephone wire , plunged into a shallow ditch in front of the battle line and directed multiple rounds of fire for three hours as @entity106 troops continued their offensive , sometimes getting within five yards of @entity0 's position			2
the board first rejected @entity0 's application in 1997 on its merits and turned away an appeal in june 2000 , saying at the time no new evidence warranted a hearing or a new decoration despite more than a dozen letters of support for @entity0			2
in the years that followed , lawmakers in @entity20 , @entity119 and three other states passed resolutions backing the effort to see @entity0 receive the @entity13			2
after @entity54 found three eyewitness accounts to @entity0 's deeds in 2006 , @entity33 resubmitted the case to the board in 2008 — two years after the statute of limitations expired			1
impressive hardware : @entity0 was awarded a @entity7 ( left ) for going above and beyond the call of duty while fighting in @entity85 , but his application for a @entity13 ( right ) was rejected twice a bipartisan group of current and former members of @entity70 has backed @entity0 's application in the past , including retired sen. @entity135 , a @entity137 @entity136 and @entity3 veteran ; retired sen. @entity139 , a @entity140 from @entity20 ; current senate minority leader @entity141 of @entity20 ; and @entity142 , who represents @entity0 's home town near the @entity119 line			1
noted @entity3 historian @entity145 , who died in 2002 , wrote in november 2000 to support @entity0 's application , saying his actions were ' far above the call of duty			1
' the review board remained unmoved by @entity0 's submission			2
' the most recent information received 22 december 2008 is not new evidence and does not warrant granting an exception to the above cited regulation and a formal hearing , ' wrote @entity155 , the director of the @entity156 february 9 , 2009			0
while the military board has upgraded other recipients of the @entity7 to a @entity13 , the action is rare			0
a s of 2012 , the last year available , 178 @entity160 had been elevated to @entity13 status out of 13,000 issued since 1917			0
military policy dictates that the first decoration must be re-examined , re-justified and then re-evaluated with new evidence before any action can be taken			0
the military can also conduct a review at the behest of @entity70			0
in february , the @entity168 announced that president @entity169 will bestow the @entity13 on 24 other veterans after a decade - long congressionally mandated review of minorities who may have been passed over for it because of prejudices			0
the unusual mass ceremony , scheduled for tuesday , will honor veterans — most of @entity178 or @entity179 heritage — who already had been recognized with the @entity7			0
@entity0 's commander in @entity3 , retired maj. gen. @entity182 filed an affidavit saying @entity0 's work , while injured , provided valuable intelligence			1
friends in high places : senate minority leader @entity141 of @entity20 is part of a bipartisan group of current and former members of @entity70 who have backed @entity0 's application ' there is no doubt that lt. @entity0 should have been awarded the @entity13 for his actions , ' @entity182 wrote			1
' one of the most disappointing regrets of my career is not having the @entity13 awarded to the most outstanding soldier i 've ever had the privilege of commanding			0
' @entity0 's fellow soldiers also filed affidavits crediting @entity0 with helping not only save the lives of fellow soldiers but being key to defeating the @entity106 in the battle			0
retired lt. @entity210 , a member of the @entity211 , 7th @entity212 , said that between the artillery strikes @entity0 called in and spray from his own machine gun , he killed at least 50 @entity106 soldiers and wounded twice as many			2
" his heroic and entirely voluntary act saved our battalion , " @entity210 wrote			0
" if he had n't done what he did , we would have had to fight for our lives			0
