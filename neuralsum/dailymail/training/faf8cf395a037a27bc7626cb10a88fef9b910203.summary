staring back at the camera with a look of resignation , bogus bride @entity5 is frogmarched out of a register office in handcuffs			1
@entity11 , 20 , arrived for the sham ceremony with @entity13 , a 31 - year - old @entity14 graduate whom she barely knew , in a tight white dress wrapped in a fur coat			1
the happiest day of their lives : @entity21 ' bride ' @entity5 and her @entity14 husband - to - be @entity13 are marched away from their wedding ceremony in handcuffs jailed : @entity5 ( left ) was sentenced to 15 months in prison , while @entity13 ( right ) was given two years but the couple found officers from the @entity29 ready to arrest them after being tipped off by a suspicious registrar			1
officers discovered @entity13 had arrived in @entity31 four years earlier to study on a legitimate visa at a @entity34 university			2
but the visa had expired			0
@entity35 heard how he offered money , believed to be £ 2,500 , to @entity38 citizen @entity5 if she married him , which would have allowed him to remain in the @entity31			1
@entity5 , a warehouse worker , was jailed for 15 months while @entity13 , described as the driving force behind the deception , was jailed for two years after they admitted conspiring to breach immigration laws with their sham wedding			1
sentencing the pair , judge @entity46 said the bogus ceremony struck at the ' sanctity of marriage '			1
he said : ' you were caught undergoing a sham marriage for the purposes of immigration			1
' this is a serious offence , not only because it breaches our immigration laws but because of the aggravating feature that it strikes at the sanctity of marriage			0
@entity62 : officers from the @entity29 arrested the couple at @entity64 just as they were about to go through with the ceremony ' such offences are still prevalent today as anyone who reads the newspapers knows			2
sentences of some length are needed for such blatant and cynical offending			0
' you , @entity13 , were the instigator and had most to gain			0
you are intelligent and knew perfectly well what you were doing			0
you , @entity5 , went along with this enterprise for money			0
' they claimed to have met in a nightclub last march			1
@entity13 said they toasted their engagement with vodka – in honour of @entity11 's @entity21 heritage			1
in december the couple met the registrar at @entity64 – where they would be arrested the next week – to plan the ceremony			2
the official became suspicious when @entity13 could not spell his bride - to - be 's name and did not know her home town			2
the only thing he could tell the official about his bride 's homeland was that it was cold , had forests and that soup and ham dominated the national diet			0
@entity100 , prosecuting , said : ' there was a ceremony planning meeting on december 19 at which the registrar became concerned this wedding did not appear to be genuine			0
' she noticed @entity13 was answering all the questions and the bride appeared to be entirely disinterested in what was to take place			2
there was also no intimacy or contact between them			0
' after the hearing , a @entity29 spokesman said : ' as they pleaded guilty , the notes were not subject to handwriting analysis so we can not say they were definitively written by @entity13 but it 's true to say they were found in the boot of his car			0
' inspector @entity125 , of the @entity29 's @entity127 team , added : ' this was a marriage of convenience - convenient for @entity5 because it would have lined her pockets and convenient for @entity13 because it was a means to @entity31 residency			1

' bride ' and ' groom ' were arrested as they made their vows during ceremony
pair were jailed after admitting taking part in the sham marriage
@entity13 claimed he wooed @entity5 by cooking her a curry and serving her vodka after they met in a nightclub
