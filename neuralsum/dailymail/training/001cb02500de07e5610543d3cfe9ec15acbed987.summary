' @entity1 sees the largest fall in the top 50 centres , ' said @entity33			0
@entity33 also pointed to @entity1 's regulatory environment as a reason for its slip			1

' according to the report , @entity0 's two - point lead is ' statistically insignificant ' on the survey 's 1,000 point scale			0
