by @entity1 reporter nothing to fear			0
that 's how a few of the first @entity6 athletes to arrive at the @entity7 feel after getting their first look at an unprecedented security presence ringing the @entity10			1
with militant groups threatening to attack during the next few weeks , security and the safety of competitors and visitors to the coastal area and in the nearby mountains that will host the events has become both heightened and inescapable			1
although the overwhelming forces - an estimated 100,000 police , agents and army troops are on hand - do n't ensure there wo n't be any problems , the sheer numbers of security personnel have put some athletes at ease			1
ring of steel : more than 100,000 @entity32 security personnel will be guarding the winter games in @entity34 , @entity32 athletes and visitors will have to pass through security checkpoints in order to enter the venues for @entity10 events ' as far as safety over here , i 'm looking at it from the standpoint of a soldier , ' said @entity6 bobsled member @entity46 , who is also a sergeant in the @entity47			1
' a lot of our soldiers are in combat zones where there 's hundreds of thousands of people who do n't want them there , people that are headhunting			1
we 're in an area where there 's hundreds of thousands of people protecting us			1
' i feel pretty safe			0
' so secure , in fact , that on sunday @entity46 and teammate @entity61 ventured outside the athlete 's village on bicycles and rode to the media center to get a better grasp of the immense security detail			1
' we rode to the front door and circled around before four or five guards looked at us and finally said , " hey , you ca n't be here , " ' mr @entity46 said			0
' but they 've been great			0
they 've been respectful and very professional			0
' we 've had a lot of fun and i do n't anticipate us being in any more harm 's way than going down the mountain in a bobsled at 85 miles per hour			2
' in recent weeks , the @entity83 warned @entity6 about traveling to @entity34 and advised @entity6 athletes not to wear any team - issued uniform gear outside the venues , contending it could make them targets			1
feeling safe : @entity6 men 's @entity90 teammates @entity46 - a soldier in the @entity47 - ( left ) and @entity61 ( right ) said that after touring the @entity10 compound , they both felt safe in @entity34 while @entity6 skeleton athlete @entity94 is mindful of the advice and will be careful of his surroundings , the two - time @entity93 is not going to hide his @entity6 pedigree			1
he intends to dress in the red , white and blue			0
' i 'm planning on wearing it out around here , ' said @entity94 , from @entity102 , @entity103			0
" everyone back home kept saying , " oh , be careful and it 's too bad you ca n't wear it			2
" but if they were here , they would realize how safe it is			0
' it ( security ) is top notch			2
i do n't think there 's going to be an incident at all and if i did n't feel confident i would n't have my family come over			2
i 'm glad they 're here			0
i know they 're safe and i 've got full trust in @entity32			1
' for many athletes , these early days in @entity32 are a chance to get acclimated to the change in climate and culture			1
there are new foods to sample at the 24 - hour buffet , and it 's a chance to make new friends from around the globe			2
@entity32 soldiers ride a chairlift above the @entity10 downhill course at the @entity134 alpine resort outside @entity34 but early monday morning was devoted to a truly @entity6 tradition : watching the @entity136			1
despite a nine - hour time difference , some members of the @entity6 contingent gathered in front of the tv to watch the @entity142 and @entity143 kick off at 3.30am local time			1
' i did n't wake up ( until ) 6 o'clock to watch the last quarter and i was a little disappointed to come down and see the score , ' said @entity149 bobsled driver @entity148 , alluding to the @entity142 43 - 8 blowout win			0
' it was a little surprising			0
' @entity148 , a three - time olympian and the defending gold medalist in four - man , hopes getting to @entity34 early will put he and his teammates ahead of the field before they get to the track			1
' i think right now we 're at an advantage , ' @entity148 said			0
' we 're getting used to the situation			0
' the @entity6 moguls team also deviated from past scripts , staying in the athletes village for the games , and reigning @entity10 moguls champion @entity164 said that 's another advantage			1
from there , it 's just a short trip for the skiers to the mountain and they can avoid an additional security check since they 're already inside a secure area			2
any way to be more relaxed helps , @entity164 said			0
' it 's actually a little less stressful here			2
... it 's been wonderful , ' @entity164 said			2
' clearly , there have been a lot of questions about security , a lot of focus on it			0
i think with that it came in with some expectations that it would be different or more stressful , and it has not , which is great			0
