@entity1 's first outing after winning the @entity2 did not go according to plan as he finished the first round of the @entity5 on three over par. the 21 - year - old has enjoyed a whirlwind few days since dominating in @entity8 to win by four shots from @entity10 and @entity11 , but that rollercoaster ride interrupted his preparations here as he did not play a practice round and he looked tired as he struggled in difficult conditions in @entity16			1
@entity1 looked tired as he struggled in difficult conditions in @entity16 in cold temperatures and with strong northerly winds , @entity1 three - putted the sixth to drop his first shot of the day and looked lethargic as he missed birdie opportunities on the ninth and 10th greens			1
he dropped another shot on the 11th and on the par - three 14th he sent his tee shot straight into the water , setting up a double bogey that put him four over par. he pulled one back with a birdie on the par - five 15th , but nevertheless finished well off the pace with three - over 74 even as the conditions kept the scoring under control			1
the @entity2 champion finished well off the pace by carding a three - over - par 74 after his round , @entity1 told @entity38 4 he had no idea how many interviews and appearances he has made since sunday			1
' i 've lost track , ' he said			0
' just getting to experience all these incredible things , whether it 's a business interview , a sports interview , appearing on @entity48 ( the @entity49 ) , meeting president @entity50 , a lot took place and it 's almost sad to leave			0
' there were so many great experiences you 'd like to have each of those each day , to have them all in one is almost a shame , but it 's good sharing my story , sharing our story , getting our brand out there			0
' @entity1 admitted lack of preparation affected his first round in @entity16 unless he has something very special up his sleeve for friday , @entity1 appears set for a much - needed weekend off			2
@entity69 and @entity70 shared the lead on five under after the first round at @entity73			1
in difficult conditions , with strong winds and a distinct chill in @entity16 , birdies were hard to come by but @entity69 carded six before a bogey on the 18th , while @entity70 matched him only in reverse after bogeying the first			1
given the way the course was playing , staying at the top of the leaderboard was as much about survival as anything			0
' i was greasy today , ' @entity69 said on the @entity89 website			2
' it was n't my best ball striking , it was n't easy out there , but i got the best out of it			0
@entity70 shared the lead on five under with @entity69 after the first round ' it was blowing			1
back in the trees , when it 's coming from the north and banking off the trees going the other way , it 's dicey , but for the most part i did a good job			0
' @entity108 is alone in third place , one shot back , ahead of a five - way tie for fourth which includes @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115			2
@entity115 could have been much better placed but for a bogey on the third and a double bogey on the seventh , where his tee shot put him in the trees and he faced a long road back			0
he had earlier carded five birdies in six holes between the second and seventh holes .			0

@entity1 struggled on his return to action following @entity8 *triumph*
the 21 - year - old carded three - over - par 74 in first round at the @entity5
he finished eight shots behind leaders @entity69 and @entity70
