by @entity0 published : 20:09 est , 29 december 2012 updated : 20:39 est , 29 december 2012 new role : @entity2 is to play a @entity4 journalist in an upcoming film the death of dashing @entity7 broke the hearts of millions of @entity11 fans on christmas day			1
but @entity2 , the actor who played him , already has his next job lined up – playing a @entity4 journalist in a new @entity16 film about @entity18 founder @entity17			1
he will appear alongside his friend @entity19 , of @entity21 fame , who has landed the lead role of the controversial whistleblower			1
@entity2 , who is currently on @entity24 in the play @entity25 , told @entity26 in @entity27 that ‘ we ’re in negotiations ’ about the movie			2
@entity17 had a turbulent relationship with @entity4 when they collaborated over the release of 250,000 secret @entity35 diplomatic cables last year			1
@entity2 ’s character , who is called @entity37 , is based on @entity4 deputy editor @entity38			1
@entity40 ’s @entity39 , which is making the film , has struck a rights deal with @entity4 , although a spokesman insisted that neither @entity38 nor editor @entity44 had personally benefited from the arrangement			1
filming will take place next year – at the same time as the fourth series of @entity11 is shot , which may explain why @entity2 had to quit the @entity49 period drama			2
he has previously said : ‘ there are some very exciting opportunities			0
@entity11 was a very monopolising job			0
i have n’t done as many films as i would have liked			0
’ @entity57 beauty @entity55 , 24 , has also signed up for the film , which may be called @entity59			1
it is not being made with the blessing of @entity18			0
but the studio has bought up the rights to two biographies of @entity17 – one by former @entity18 spokesman @entity65 and another by @entity4 journalists @entity67 and @entity68			1
the studio behind the film has bought the rights to two biographies of @entity17 ( pictured ) who is currently hold up in the @entity74 embassy monopolising : @entity2 said that his role in @entity11 ( cast pictured ) did not allow him to do as many films as he would have liked all of the authors have fallen out with @entity17 , who is currently holed up in @entity74 embassy in @entity79 to avoid extradition to @entity57 to face sexual assault charges			1
@entity18 spokesman @entity82 said : ‘ if the film reflects what is written in those books , it will provide a negative view of @entity18 with limited impartiality			2
@entity16 is not exactly the best reflection of contemporary history			0
‘ i do n’t believe @entity18 or @entity17 has been contacted by @entity39 , but i do n’t expect any courtesy from any organisation within @entity16			1
’ last year , at least five film versions of the @entity18 story were said to be in development			2
in the @entity98 episode she played @entity99 , a flirtatious housemaid whose clumsy attempt to seduce a topless @entity101 , the former chauffeur who has married into the @entity7 family , led to her being dismissed from service			0
but such antics are tame compared with what @entity105 gets up to in @entity109 crime drama @entity107 , which begins tonight			0
set in 1889 in the aftermath of the @entity113 murders , it stars the @entity57 - born actress , 28 – who played a vampire in two of the twilight films – as @entity118 , a feisty brothel - keeper who is on the run from the law in @entity35			0
@entity121 woman : @entity105 with @entity123 ( left ) in @entity107 clumsy : @entity105 played @entity99 , a flirtatious housemaide whose attempt to seduce a topless @entity125 , led to her being dismissed from service @entity118 and her ex-lover @entity127 , a renegade former @entity129 surgeon ( @entity127 ) , have a tempestuous relationship and are forever arguing			0
the situation is n’t helped by the fact that @entity127 , a drunk and a gambler , is now sleeping with @entity135 , a prostitute played by @entity123			0
viewers first see @entity105 ’s character as she watches through a peephole as @entity127 makes love to @entity135			2
in another risque storyline , @entity127 discovers @entity118 has hired out @entity135 to a man who may be a murderer			0
@entity11 will thrive despite the controversial death of @entity7 , the show ’s writer @entity142 has insisted			0
lord @entity142 said the character ’s demise shortly after he had become a father would mean a pivotal role for his widow @entity149 in the fourth series of the @entity49 drama next year			1
‘ @entity149 is back on her own , establishing her rights as the guardian of her baby son , fighting to get the estate through the dark days of the @entity156 , struggling to re-find her own life , ’ said @entity142 .			2
