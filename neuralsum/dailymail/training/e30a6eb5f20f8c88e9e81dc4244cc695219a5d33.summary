by @entity0 published : 05:30 est , 19 october 2012 updated : 09:04 est , 19 october 2012 a computer thought to be one of the oldest in the world has been brought back to life by two dedicated scientists in a garden shed			1
@entity8 and @entity9 have spent hundreds of hours breathing life into ' @entity11 ' , an @entity13 mainframe that cost £ 250,000 - or £ 4.2million today - in 1962			1
over the last nine years the duo have had to overcome nearly 1,000 problems with the machine to get it working again			2
@entity9 and @entity18 with the ticker tape used to program ' @entity11 ' in @entity9 's garden shed - which the pair spent nine years rebuilding the @entity22 shed where the team rebuilt @entity11 over nine years @entity25 's computing power is roughly equivalent to a digital watch			1
the computing power of the huge machine is tiny by modern standards at a miniscule 2kb of memory running at 1mhz speed			1
technology has progressed so much that its 16,000 transistors and 4,000 logic boards could fit onto two 10mm silicon chips today , while its 27 reels of magnetic tape and 100,000 punch cards would fit on less than a third of a cd			1
they now face the painstaking task of using 27 reels of magnetic tape and 100,000 punch cards to recover the computer 's ' software '			1
despite being 25 square feet and weighing five tons ' @entity11 ' is only 1/10 as powerful as a modern - day smart phone and has roughly the same power as a digital wristwatch			1
it featured as a prop in the climax of the 1974 @entity54 film @entity53 , starring @entity55			1
the scientists believe they need another six months to recover the computer 's software - which they believe will offer a fascinating insight into the birth of the @entity61 computer industry			1
but their plans could be scuppered if a new home can not be found for ' @entity11 '			0
the old computer is currently housed in a shed on a farm in @entity22 , with the owners in the process of selling the property			2
all of the data the computer has inside it would fit onto 1/3 of a cd			2
an advertising image of @entity11 , an @entity13 , in the sixties			0
the computer 's main purpose was to produce @entity76 exam results and certificates @entity78 in the 1960s			1
@entity8 , 67 , and @entity9 , 59 , have spent 2,500 man hours working on breathing life into the machine over the past decade			2
@entity9 , a volunteer of the @entity82 , said : ' the technologies in this machine need to be recorded for archaeological reasons			0
' it is important they are available to future @entity61 generations			0
' whether we can start the process to do that is an unknown at the moment			0
@entity55 and @entity94 with a 1301 control panel in @entity97 's lair in the @entity98			0
the computer first featured as a prop in the climax of the 1974 @entity54 film @entity53 , starring @entity55			1
as well as featuring in @entity54 , the computer was also used as a prop in numerous early episodes of dr who and the @entity110 science fiction series @entity107			1
it also appeared in the @entity113 job			0
however , even in it 's retirement , @entity11 has still kept in touch with the tv world - the farm where the computer currently resides was used to film the hit @entity119 television series @entity121			1
the 1301 control panel appeared several times in @entity97 's lair in the @entity98			0
' we are talking to a couple of places about where it could eventually go			0
' it would be nice if it could end up at the @entity131 or @entity132			0
' i know 1/3 of a cd does n't sound like much , but that contains the early years of the @entity61 computer industry			2
' since the 1960s we have lost the race to the @entity138 , but this is a reminder that there once was a great early @entity61 computer industry			0
' the foundation of the early @entity61 computer industry is enshrined in this machine			2
' we ca n't run it in the winter as it is too cold , in the meantime we are trying to find it another home			0
' the 1962 @entity13 mainframe computer - the first machine out of the factory - is the only example of second - generation @entity61 mainframe that is still in working order			1
where 's the keyboard ? @entity25 's main control panel where programmers would use dials and switches to issue commands to the machine the interior of the shed where @entity11 has been brought back to life it was bought by a group of students from @entity170 and @entity9 acquired it from them in the 1970s			2
the computing power of the huge machine is tiny by modern standards at a miniscule 2kb of memory running at 1mhz speed			1
technology has progressed so much that its 16,000 transistors and 4,000 logic boards could fit onto two 10mm silicon chips today			0
originally there were 150 of the computers worldwide			0
only four are left but ' @entity11 ' is the only one of the computers which still works			0
the remaining three are in @entity187 , @entity188 and @entity189			0
as well as featuring in @entity54 , the computer was also used as a prop in numerous early episodes of dr who and the @entity110 science fiction series @entity107			1
the farm where the computer currently resides was used to film the hit @entity119 television series @entity121			0

1962 computer would have cost £ 4.2 million pounds to build built today
two dedicated engineers have spent nine years *resurrecting* the machine , which starred as a prop in dozens of tv shows and films *including* dr who and @entity53
@entity231 now face the painstaking task of using 27 reels of magnetic tape and 100,000 punch cards to recover the computer 's software
machine has roughly the same computing power as a digital watch
