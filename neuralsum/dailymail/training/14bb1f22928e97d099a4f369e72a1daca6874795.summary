@entity0 claimed his fourth goal in a week and @entity2 their third straight win after deservedly beating local rivals @entity4 1 - 0 at @entity5			1
@entity0 , a big - money move from @entity7 in the summer , continued his red - hot form with a 24th minute winner , heading in from close range after indecision from @entity12 and keeper @entity13			1
@entity14 missed a gilt - edged chance for @entity4 in the second half but @entity0 could have claimed a hat - trick after lobbing over when clean through and then seeing a shot cleared off the line by @entity20			1
leap : @entity0 rises high in the box to score his fourth goal in as many games for the @entity2 @entity4 : @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 ( c ) , @entity20 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity14 , @entity29 , @entity30 ( @entity31 72 ) , @entity32 ( @entity33 72 ) , @entity34 ( @entity35 71 ) @entity2 : @entity36 ; @entity37 ( c ) , @entity38 ( @entity39 7 ) , @entity40 , @entity41 ; @entity42 , @entity43 ; @entity44 ( @entity38 53 ) , @entity45 ( @entity46 83 ) , @entity47 ; @entity0			1
goals : @entity0 24 @entity2 shaded the early possession , but it was typical derby fare played out under a red - hot atmosphere but with little composure			1
a nice break from @entity2 right - back @entity41 saw his shot comfortably gathered by @entity13 with the angle against the defender			2
the @entity59 keeper was again equal to a shot from outside the area , from @entity0 after good work from @entity63 halfway through a tight first half			2
two minutes later , the visitors broke the deadlock after a horror show from the @entity59 defence			0
after a corner was initially cleared , @entity42 headed back in and @entity0 got in between @entity28 and @entity13 to head in from close range with the home defence claiming offside			0
it was his fourth of the season after scoring twice in midweek against @entity74 , following his first goal for the club against @entity77 last saturday			0
frustrating : @entity13 looks to his defence as @entity2 take advantage of a defensive lapse to take the lead delighted : @entity0 celebrates with fellow new signing @entity44 after putting @entity2 ahead @entity4 went close to equalising in the 29th minute with @entity29 shooting just wide after a neat free - kick from @entity12			1
it took the hosts 37 minutes to finally test @entity36 , though @entity14 's shot lacked power , before they almost equalised five minutes after the restart when a patient build - up lead to @entity32 's teasing cross met powerfully by @entity14 who headed wide of the far post from the edge of the six - yard box			0
just two minutes later , @entity2 were guilty of missing an equally good chance when @entity39 's through ball found @entity0 in space but he opted to try and chip @entity13 and a great chance to provide breathing space sailed harmlessly over the bar			1
elated : @entity102 celebrates the first derby win of his managerial career with midfielder @entity43 shortly before the hour mark , @entity29 tested @entity36 at his near post before @entity0 saw a speculative volley pushed away by @entity13			2
the in - form forward went even closer after being released by @entity43 but , after rounding @entity13 , his effort was cleared off the line by the backtracking @entity20			0
with neither side giving an inch , @entity59 sub @entity33 got beyond the @entity2 defence but his dangerous cross was hacked clear by @entity40			0
with 10 minutes to go , @entity45 almost made the points safe breaking clear down the left but having a powerful shot blocked by @entity13			0
real chances , and entertainment , was few and far between as the clock ticked down and leaving the @entity2 fans celebrating a local derby victory .			0

@entity0 's first - half goal was enough for @entity2 to win at @entity5
@entity0 has now scored four goals in as many games for the @entity2
@entity2 go top of the league with their third straight league win
