by @entity0 mirrors have existed for thousands of years but the looking glass has just been given a 21st century makeover			0
a new digital mirror gives people x-ray vision to let them see their insides – complete with bones , organs and muscle on show			2
the 3d art installation , called the ‘ @entity13 , ’ recreates what a body looks like inside and eerily tracks a person ’s movements as if they are seeing themselves			1
this information is processed so that if the person stands in front of the ' mirror ' , they can see their insides because the scans and x-rays are projected on the screen in realtime			1
even people who have not been scanned can see a similar person 's anatomy			0
a @entity45 captures the participants ’ movements			2
a gender - determining algorithm chooses whether to project a masculine or feminine form on the screen			2
the mirror shows a 3d image of the human body on a 65 - inch screen			1
when a person comes sufficiently close to the projection , they see the interior of ‘ their ’ body as if through a magnetic resonance image			0
the x-ray and nuclear imaging reveal the texture of the bones and muscles , cerebral activity , the functioning of organs			0
the scientists said : ‘ fascinated , the participant discovers her internal organs with , which she has always lived without ever seeing them			0
a new intimacy is established with the stranger that is our own body			0
’ the mirror will go on show at the @entity83 conference in @entity84 , @entity85 , and viewers who experienced the technology in @entity88 reacted self - consciously to seeing their anatomy in a new way			1
one woman tried to shield herself from being laid bare on the giant black screen , which the mirror ’s creators say it helps people explore how they relate to their bodies			1
the mirror works by using @entity30 scans , mri scans and x-rays of people to capture details of their anatomy in high resolution , which takes around three - and - a - half hours			1
this information is processed so that if the person stands in front of the ' mirror ' , they can see their insides because the scans and x-rays are projected on the screen in realtime			1
even people who have not been scanned can see a similar person 's anatomy			0
the mirror also knows if they are male or female thanks to a gender recognition algorithm to make a close match			1
the 65inch ( 165cm ) screen uses @entity45 ’s motion - capture camera to track the movements of a person standing in front of the screen , focusing on the movement of 24 joints			1
laid bare : a digital mirror , which is a @entity126 art installation recreates what your body might look like inside and eerily tracks a person 's movements as if they are seeing though themselves experience recorded : @entity134 , a medical imaging researcher at the @entity136 , who came up with the concept , observed the reactions of 30 people who were left alone with the revealing mirror for three minutes each and then completed a questionnaire about their experience ( pictured ) the x-ray and nuclear imaging reveal the texture of the bones and muscles , cerebral activity and the functioning of organs			1
‘ if the visitor stands in front of this mirror , gets closer or farther , she or he enters or exits her or his @entity157 , x-ray , or nuclear body that is reflecting her or him			2
she or he discovers by own means an intimacy that was hidden so far to her or him , ’ the scientists said			0
@entity134 , a medical imaging researcher at the @entity136 , who came up with the concept , observed the reactions of 30 people who were left alone with the revealing mirror for three minutes each and then completed a questionnaire about their experience			2
they were shown images of other people of the same sex – to save time and so that the experiment had more impact – and the team of researchers found one third of people naturally tried to cover ‘ their ’ exposed bodies and felt uncomfortable			2
peculiar and profound : the installation is designed to create ' a profound image ; a peculiar and unexpected avatar of our identity			0
' around a third of people looking at ' themselves ' in a new way reported feeling self conscious insides revealed : the mirror shows the results of a pet scan , x-ray and mri scan and @entity45 technology animates them to match a viewer 's movements mr @entity134 explained that peoples ’ reactions to the mirror were similar to a child ’s unsure if their reflection is actually an image of themselves			1
‘ it 's as if you 're inside your body			0
you 're discovering something that belongs to you , ’ he told @entity205			0
in the study , the researchers explained that the more a person embodies an avatar , the more the avatar influences their self - perception			0
they said the self - conscious reaction is as old as the @entity218 mythological character @entity219 and that ‘ standing in front of a reflecting medium is a fundamental self - perception - building experience ’			2
self - conscious ? one woman tried to shield herself from being laid bare on the giant black screen , which the mirror 's creators say helps people explore how they relate to their bodies mr @entity134 explained that peoples ’ reactions to the mirror were similar to a child ’s unsure if their reflection is actually an image of themselves			1
here ' naked ' bodies appear to dance rediscovery : ' if the visitor stands in front of this mirror , gets closer or farther , she or he enters or exits her or his @entity157 , x-ray , or nuclear body that is reflecting her or him			1
she or he discovers by own means an intimacy that was hidden so far to her or him , ' the scientists said they also noted that inner images of living bodies often make people uncomfortable if they are suggesting ‘ extreme nudity ’			2
‘ this association of body interior and personal privacy is characteristic of the @entity259 culture , for which the inner self lies deep in the body , ’ they said			0
mr @entity263 hopes to make the experience more realistic by making the heart on the screen beat and the lungs move			0
while then mirror is currently an art project , he hopes the technology could be used by doctors in the future to help people prepare for operations			0
the digital mirror is not the only project using augmented reality for use in a medical environment			0
a different mirror called ‘ @entity281 medical imagery directly onto a person 's body , while another technology can animate mri data on a standard computer screen and show body parts that might prove troublesome in the future			1
naked ? the person standing in front of the mirror sees an animated version of themselves without any skin in realtime			1

@entity306 will go on show at the @entity83 conference in @entity84 , @entity85 and has been experienced by viewers in @entity88
creators of the mirror at @entity136 believe it helps people explore how they relate to their bodies
the screen shows pet scan , mri scan and x-ray images and uses a gender recognition algorithm to match them to users
it uses @entity45 ’s motion - capture camera to track the movements of a person standing in front of it
