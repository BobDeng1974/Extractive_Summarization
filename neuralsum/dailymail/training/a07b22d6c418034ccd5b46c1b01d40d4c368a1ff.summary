@entity0 has been widely attacked for selling his services to some of the world ’s most authoritarian leaders mr @entity0 , 61 , has been widely attacked for selling his services to some of the world ’s most authoritarian leaders , including the @entity33 leader @entity32 and @entity35 president @entity34			1
after detailing mr @entity0 ’s work for several questionable world leaders , the author of the profile and interview , @entity18 contributing editor @entity41 , wrote : ‘ and is there anyone he would n’t work for ? ‘ for instance , would he work for @entity1 if @entity1 called asking for advice ? @entity0 smiled , and switched the topic to @entity35			1

’ he insisted the @entity24 leader was never likely to seek his services			0
mr @entity0 , who insisted that ‘ whatever criticisms people have of me , they ’ve seldom thought of me as politically stupid ’ , said there were no conflicts of interest between his charity role and lucrative work as an international advisor			1

and i keep saying , that ’s why you should listen to me			0
