@entity0 and @entity1 have cleared the air after @entity5 ’s @entity4 manager gave his blessing for @entity7 to be selected for @entity9 ’s under - 21s			1
@entity0 and @entity10 became embroiled in a spat when @entity9 ’s head coach said the issue of @entity7 ’s fitness had been ‘ mentioned ’ at the @entity16 finals			1
@entity10 hit back by saying that @entity0 was ‘ in no position ’ to make such a judgment			1
however , @entity0 and @entity10 have spoken extensively in recent weeks and dealt with the issue of @entity7 being made available for @entity21 ’s under - 21 squad for the @entity23 play - off against @entity24			1
@entity7 's fitness was raised as a problem following his move to @entity5 in the summer @entity1 ( left ) and @entity0 ( right ) were embroiled in a spat over the player , but have since made up @entity0 and @entity21 went to see @entity7 , who has just returned from a hamstring problemmake his @entity5 debut in the 2 - 1 win over @entity33 11 days ago and @entity10 ’s felt it would be beneficial for the 18 - year - old ’s development — and his fitness — to be involved in two pressurised matches			1
@entity21 said : ‘ at the moment @entity0 would deal with louis direct			1
with some of the players i ’ll deal with the first team manager but in this instance , because @entity0 is dealing with @entity44 on @entity45 and hopefully others that will be involved , @entity0 had that conversation			2
‘ the last time i saw @entity10 was in a lift in @entity49 during the @entity16			0
it broke down on the morning they were playing @entity52 , so we had a laugh about that — him and @entity56 , our lift got stuck between floors , thankfully for not too long ! @entity7 has now received @entity1 's blessing to play for the @entity61 squad @entity7 , right , will play for @entity21 's side in a @entity23 play - off match against @entity24 ‘ but i know from the conversation that he was really positive about him coming and playing matches			1
it is not something we ’ve just thought “ we ’ll make this squad as strong as we possibly can ” – we are thinking about the individuals all the time and what is the right experience for them			0
’ @entity21 , meanwhile , has moved to clarify the situation surrounding @entity75 ’s selection for the senior squad , when he had gone more than a year without playing for the under - 21s			2
@entity0 ’s decision was met with stinging criticism from former under - 21 head coach @entity80			2
but @entity21 said : ‘ the first squad i selected last september , he was injured			0
in the october games , he was still carrying an injury and @entity84 were in @entity85			0
there was a lot going on because his girlfriend was pregnant so i did n’t think he was ready			0
‘ i had a good chat with him ( when he arrived at @entity90 ) about it as obviously he ’s thought “ what have i walked into ? ” he was n’t eligible for @entity94 because of his age			0
could i have called him back in ? yes i could , but i ’m very big on the group and rewarding those that have done well			0
’ @entity101 hails @entity103 inclusion			0
