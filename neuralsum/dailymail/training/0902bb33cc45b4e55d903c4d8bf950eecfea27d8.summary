thousands of people are claiming to experience pleasure from listening to whispers and scratchy noises in a bizarre phenomenon known as @entity6 , it has emerged			1
even watching the gentle act of folding towels gives some people a tingle down the spine and a tingle in their scalp			1
known as @entity6 , the idea of it may seem like an @entity16 ’s day joke			1
there are @entity6 videos of polished fingernails tapping on a plastic surface , of someone wrapping presents , of people being given massages , of performers whispering to camera in @entity47			1
there are people pretending to be doctors giving the viewer a ‘ cranial nerve exam ’ , and others pretending to cut your hair , pretending to give you a job interview or pretending to be a receptionist at hotel check - in			0
there is no scientific evidence to explain @entity6 but brain scientists say the hard wiring of some people ’s brains mean they get stimulation from quietly satisfying things			1
viewing videos to recreate the sensation provides an extra ‘ shot ’ of pleasure , it is claimed			0
there are @entity6 videos of polished fingernails tapping on a plastic surface and of people wrapping gifts one @entity6 video shows someone rustling plastic bags			2
devotees insist it is a real phenomenon , and has spawned a cottage industry , with dozens of video artists creating pleasurable sensations for viewers they are astonishingly popular , with 770,000 views over two years notched up so far for an 18 minute video of a woman demonstrating ways to fold towels and napkins			1
among the many who own up to @entity6 is @entity95 science reporter @entity94 , whose experiences date back decades			2
he said ‘ when i was a child i sometimes experienced a pleasant physical sensation in my scalp when i was especially intrigued or fascinated by something , or when being touched or stroked in certain ways			0
‘ the sensation continued into adulthood , but when i tried to explain what i was feeling to other people i was met with baffled looks and a quick change of subject			2
’ he says the videos can trigger - in a minority of people - a particular sensation in their scalp , best described as a buzzing or tingling that ’s warm , relaxing and extremely pleasurable			2
one video of a blonde woman with an eastern @entity116 accent who calls herself @entity117 lasts 16 minutes and has been viewed 7.6 million times some fans say they feel calmer after watching an @entity6 video , or that it helps with sleeping difficulties			1
@entity123 , professor of neuroscience at @entity126 @entity125 , has failed to find any research to support a neurobiological basis for why these sensory experiences should be induced by observing @entity6 videos			0
but he is profoundly sceptical of their use as a kind of home - brewed alternative therapy : “ he said ‘ what worries me is susceptible individuals who want to believe this kind of thing because they really have problems and need some kind of psychological help - that is where i get a little bit annoyed , because people can be led up the garden path by techniques that clearly are snake oil , and do not and will not provide any long term benefit for an underlying condition			0
’ @entity152 neuroscientist @entity151 , who has written about @entity6 , says he ’s ‘ inclined to think it ’s a real phenomenon ’ not least because so many people report similar experiences			1
he said ‘ i have never experienced this myself			0
i listened to the whispering in @entity47 video , which was eerily intimate at first , and then just a bit weird , although i always love listening to @entity47			0
‘ but i experienced no tingling or euphoria			0
’ he said ‘ it is plausible that a subset of the population has a particular pattern of neural hard wiring so that when they experience certain things that are typically quietly satisfying they get a little extra shot to their pleasure centre			1
‘ once they experience this then they seek out greater and greater triggers of this response , and perhaps then a learning or conditioning component kicks in			0
’ the @entity181 and @entity182 website , which lists the triggers , seeks volunteers for research who have @entity6 experiences – and also those who do not for comparison purposes .			0
