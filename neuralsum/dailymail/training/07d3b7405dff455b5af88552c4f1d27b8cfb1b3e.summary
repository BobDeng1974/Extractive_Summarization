even the finest dish can taste bland when the telly is switched on , because it causes distractions that ruin our taste perception , say scientists			1
and it ’s bad news for slimmers as well as gastronomes			2
the telly causes distractions that ruin our taste perception when eating , say scientists ditching the dining table for the sofa can also lead us to eat more by removing the sense of how much we are scoffing , the researchers found			1
six out of ten meals in @entity25 homes are now eaten while watching tv , but simply switching it off could help reduce calorie intake and improve the enjoyment of a meal , according to the report			2
in a series of experiments , @entity33 researchers made diners carry out complicated memory tests while eating food that was either salty , sweet , or sour			1
the study , published in the journal @entity41 , found that those who were distracted by the mental task were more likely to perceive the food as bland			0
another experiment found they consumed more food in order to obtain the same taste level and were less aware of how much they ate			0
distracted individuals were more likely to eat crackers that were saltier or add extra sugar to their lemonade			0
the report , by dr @entity55 of @entity56 and @entity57 of @entity58 , concluded : ‘ these results are highly relevant in today ’s society , in which multi-tasking is common			1
six out of ten meals in @entity25 homes are now eaten while watching tv ‘ when cognitively engaged , such as while watching tv or driving a car , people ’s taste perception is likely attenuated , which may contribute to unhealthy eating behaviours , such as increasing the intake of certain foods or adding more of certain flavourings			1
’ previous @entity25 research has found that eating while distracted can boost consumption by 10 per cent – and at later meals by more than 25 per cent			0
the average @entity75 now eats 13 meals at home each week – eight of them while watching television , a study earlier this year found			0
more than a third of adults told the poll it was normal to eat a meal on the sofa , to not appreciate the food on their plate or notice the flavour .			0
