a new @entity1 video gives a terrifying portrayal of the vulnerability of drunk women - and the shocking lengths that some men will go to in order to take advantage of their inebriated state			1
the video , which was created by social media entrepreneur @entity11 , follows a young woman - who is pretending to be seriously intoxicated - as she tries to find her way home from @entity16			1
throughout the video , the young woman , who introduces herself as @entity17 , appears to be sipping from a beer can as she staggers from one man to another asking for directions to her bus stop			1
introducing the video , the woman briefly explains the details of the experiment , saying : ' hey guys , today i 'm on @entity16 , i 've had a little too much to drink			1
let 's see if anyone will help me to get home			2
' shockingly , of the five men featured , only one actually offers her assistance , while the rest attempt to lure her back to their homes - despite her obviously drunken state			1
' hey , where you going ? ' the first man asks			0
' you do n't need to take a bus , we 're going to go this way			2
we 're going to go somewhere else ... to my house			0
there 's a bus line at my house			2
' ' i just want to help you ' : another man tries to get the young woman into his car ( pictured ) ' i have more beer ' : one of the last men @entity17 approaches offers to give her more alcohol - if she will go back to his place and ' hang out ' he later adds : ' i got a water bed , i got all of that			1
come on , it 's right there			0
' another asks whether @entity17 wants to ' hang out ' at his home , before he tries to convince her to get into his car			2
' @entity82 , come on , ' he says			0
' i just want to help you so much			0
it 's ok , just come with me			0
' the last two men featured in the video nearly come to blows deciding who will get the chance to escort @entity17 home			1
while one is offering to take @entity17 back to his place , where he has ' more beer ' , the second interrupts their conversation - and for a brief moment it seems like he might actually be staging a rescue , as he tells the first man to ' f * * k off '			0
' f * * k off ' : two men nearly come to blows over who will get the chance to escort the drunk woman home @entity108 in shining armor : only one man ( pictured ) offers to help @entity17 find her bus stop sadly that is n't the case			1
' you 're not going home with him , you 're coming home with me , ' he says to @entity17 , before adding : ' you should n't hang around with such losers , [ my place ] is close by			0
' only one man - the second person to be approached during filming - tries to help @entity17 find her bus stop and even offers her assistance as she makes her way down some stairs			1
the shocking video footage comes just a few weeks after a similar clip ( see below ) , which documented the verbal harassment one woman received while walking around @entity132 , surfaced online , sparking outrage from women around the world			0
that video has since been watched by more than 35 million people .			0

an *actress* , pretending to be drunk , asked five men on @entity16 if they would help her find her bus stop - and filmed their *reactions*
of the five men featured , only one offered her assistance while the rest tried to take her home
