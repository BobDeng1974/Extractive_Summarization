by @entity0 published : 18:43 est , 25 october 2013 updated : 03:54 est , 26 october 2013 warning : professor @entity1 , pictured , says the @entity3 levy is something the government ' really should not do ' plans to make foreigners pay a £ 200 @entity3 surcharge would create the ‘ best travel insurance on the planet ’ , a leading surgeon has warned			1
professor @entity1 said the government ’s move would be a ‘ disaster ’ and simply attract more ‘ health tourists ’			1
the proposals , which affect migrants and foreign students staying in the @entity19 for more than six months , came as the government estimated that health tourism was costing the @entity3 up to £ 2billion a year			1
professor @entity1 , a cancer specialist , was one of the first whistleblowers to expose the financial impact of @entity26 residents seeking free healthcare on the @entity3			1
he said : ‘ it [ the levy ] is the worst thing they could do			0
the biggest disaster that can happen to the solution of health tourism would be to accept this £ 200 levy for migrants wanting to come to this country and for students			2
’ he added : ‘ if you sell to the visitor what is essentially a travel insurance of £ 200 , the health tourists will go , “ wow , that ’s even easier than it was before with all the loopholes ; we had to jump a few fences before			1
' " all we are going to do is pay £ 200 , which is the best travel insurance on the planet and it gives us entitlement to @entity3 care ”			1
‘ of all the things that the government are proposing , that is the one thing they should really not do – allow visitors and students to pay £ 200 at the border for access to the health service			2
that would be an absolute disaster			0
’ professor @entity1 also said the £ 2billion figure quoted by the government regarding the cost of health tourism was wildly inaccurate			1
‘ i do n’t accept those figures ; they grossly underplay the total cost , ’ he said			0
‘ for example , i know of examples where the bill for individual health tourists has been between £ 500,000 and £ 1million			2
i know of one district general hospital where they get about 15 health tourists a month			0
’ he pointed to @entity19 citizens who have retired in the sun and then return to the @entity19 when they find out they have cancer or another illness			0
costly : a report estimated the health tourism costs the @entity3 up to £ 2billion a year extra strain : according to professor @entity1 , the @entity3 levy will make coming to the @entity19 for treatment even more attractive ‘ the longest example i have is 48 years , but i have other examples of 20 , 30 and 40 years , who then suddenly just walk back into the country with a serious illness			1
they are impossible to identify			0
’ for years professor @entity1 has criticised how the three main political parties subscribe to the mantra that the @entity3 should be ‘ free at the point of use ’			1
‘ the consequence of such altruism - all at the @entity19 taxpayer ’s expense - is health tourism and abuse of the @entity3 by ineligible patients			1
the general public seem unaware of this deception despite being rightly exercised about other examples of similar abuse , such as benefit fraud			0
how is this any different ? ’ a report from the @entity107 this week concluded the @entity108 had ‘ some of the most generous rules in the world ’			0
and it even found evidence of relatives of migrants taking advantage of visits to @entity19 to have free treatment			0
the bill was put at between £ 1.9billion and £ 2billion – with only about 16 per cent of the money clawed back			2
health secretary @entity120 hopes to recover up to £ 500million a year , arguing @entity19 can not afford an ‘ international health service ’			2
the @entity122 plans a new annual levy of £ 150 on foreign students and £ 200 on temporary migrants			2
the surcharge is expected to generate £ 200million			0
a @entity107 spokesman said : ‘ the surcharge proposed is very competitive with the level charged by other countries and strikes a careful balance between making a fair contribution and maintaining the @entity19 as an attractive place to visit , study and do business			0

professor @entity1 *attacked* plans for an @entity3 surcharge
he said it would create the ' best travel insurance on the planet '
a recent report found health tourism costs the @entity3 up to £ 2billion a year
