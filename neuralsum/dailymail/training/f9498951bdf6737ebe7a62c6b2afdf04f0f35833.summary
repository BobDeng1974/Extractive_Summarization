the father of prince @entity2 ’s friend @entity1 has been accused of callously dragging out a court case after a tourist was skewered by a rampaging elephant on the wildlife estate he runs in @entity7			1
@entity8 has spent 14 years fighting for justice after suffering horrific injuries during the attack			1
the elephant ’s tusks pierced her torso from front to back , destroying one of her kidneys			1
the animal then tossed her in the air , dragged her battered body through the bush and knelt on her , its three - ton weight shattering her pelvis			1
@entity8 was on holiday with her husband and three children when she was gored so badly by a rampaging elephant that her intestines were left hanging out last week , she finally settled her long - running legal battle for an undisclosed sum			1
defendants including @entity32 had previously appealed a ruling that found them guilty of negligence and ordered them to pay more than £ 500,000 in damages			1
in an exclusive interview , mrs @entity8 , who has spent £ 100,000 in legal fees fighting her case , told @entity39 : ‘ frankly , it ’s extraordinary i ’m still alive , but i was branded as some kind of gold - digger			1
‘ i believe he hoped i would give up and go away but i wanted to know why it happened and to try to ensure no one else suffers a similar fate			1
’ she was attacked when on holiday at the @entity48 in 2000 with her husband @entity49 , a @entity51 diplomat , and their children , @entity54 , then aged ten , @entity55 , eight , and @entity56 , four			1
they had been living in @entity58 for four years and had been to the lodge – described as a ‘ wilderness experience with little or no game ’ – twice before and felt comfortable there			1
mrs @entity8 , a physiotherapist from @entity62 , @entity63 , had been invited on an early - morning run by a guide when , with two other guests , they encountered an elephant protecting its young			1
the guide first told them to stop , but then shouted ‘ run ’ and they scattered			0
mrs @entity8 later learned that had they stayed together , they would have had more chance of frightening the animal away – and also that the party were just 300 yards from the safety of the lodge			1
she said : ‘ i remember every heart - stopping moment			2
i tripped and the guide hauled me , then i was running for my life			0
i could hear the elephant closing in on me			2
it had huge tusks and its ears were flapping			0
’ terrified , she dived under a bush and curled into a ball			0
‘ @entity90 thing i knew , its head was butting into me and i could hear the sound of its tusks slicing through the earth around me			0
@entity32 , the father of @entity1 ( pictured ) , who is friends with prince @entity2 , owned the @entity7 ranch where the attack happened it pushed me about 60 yards through the bush , its tusks piercing my body before it picked me up and tossed me into the air			1
‘ when i landed , i can remember thinking that i must play dead in the hope it would stop			0
the elephant disappeared into the bush with a snort			2
’ @entity8 was horrifically wounded			1
the tusks pierced her body from front to back in four places , destroying her kidney and narrowly missing vital organs			1
@entity8 recalls : ‘ i was in excruciating pain			1
i looked down at my body and i ’ll never forget the horrific sight			2
' there were holes everywhere and out of my side spilled a mass of blood and flesh			0
i knew from the medical training i ’d done as a physiotherapist that it was my intestines			2
‘ one of my first thoughts was that i needed to get covered up as i was getting cold despite the rising heat of the @entity134 bush , and that i was going to be die of shock			0
’ incredibly , none of the lodge staff seemed to have any medical training			2
realising that she was very seriously wounded , @entity8 knew it was important to stay conscious , to stay alive			1
as lodge staff radioed mr @entity1 for help , @entity8 ’s husband , who had been inside with their children , rushed to the scene			1
the distraught couple began to say their final farewell to each other and @entity8 asked @entity49 to say goodbye to the children			1
but she clung on for about 30 minutes until mr @entity1 arrived with two planes and a private nurse who had been caring for one of his friends with terminal cancer			1
@entity8 was flown to a bush hospital an hour away , but doctors declared her injuries were too severe to treat with their limited facilities			1
she was then sent on to @entity58 , arriving in hospital four hours after the attack			0
it took surgeons six hours to stabilise her condition			0
her list of injuries includes a destroyed kidney , which was removed , multiple fractures to her pelvis and bones in her lower back , broken ribs and wounds to the abdomen , lumbar areas and legs			0
doctors warned her family to expect the worst			0
‘ i remember feeling certain that i would die from my injuries			0
every time i opened my eyes , i was astonished i was still alive , ’ @entity8 says			1
‘ the hardest part for me came four days later when the children came to visit for the first time , it still makes me tearful to think about it now			2
‘ i ’d never been parted from them before , and they arrived to see my face swollen with bruises and my body hooked up to all sorts of machines			2
' the three children just stood at my bedside and cried			2
they were very distressed and the look of trauma and pain etched on their faces will stay with me forever			0
’ after ten days @entity8 , who had private health insurance , was flown back to the @entity51 where she spent a further three months in hospital			1
but her shattered body required more delicate surgery			2
she risked paralysis during an operation to pin her pelvis back together with ten - inch metal screws and suffered from two lumbar and two abdominal hernias			2
the wound in her left leg also became infected , opening up to a point where it was gaping eight inches wide			2
‘ at one stage , i feared i was going to have to have my leg amputated , ’ she says			0
‘ it was a very hard time for me			0
‘ i had to focus on my life hour by hour			0
i was in constant excruciating pain and there always seemed to be something else going wrong , meaning i had to be rushed back into hospital			0
it was very difficult with three children to look after			2
’ the once active and fit mother found that a good day meant hobbling around on a walking frame or using a wheelchair			0
even after the wounds started to heal , she struggled to come to terms with her new body			2
‘ i felt like a mangled wreck , ’ she says			0
‘ i ’d always been very proud of my figure , i went to the gym and ate healthily , ’ she says			0
‘ my body is covered with large ugly scars			2
at first i did n’t feel entirely comfortable wearing swimwear because people do stare at my scars , but now they are badges of my survival that i wear with pride			0
’ it took an astonishing three years of legal correspondence before it even emerged that there was no insurance at the lodge			0
‘ it was obvious to us that mr @entity1 was distancing himself from what had happened , ’ said mrs @entity8			1
‘ i had no idea at the time that he was a powerful landowner			0
‘ it ’s been incredibly difficult watching his business and influence grow through his royal and society connections while he would n’t take responsibility for what had happened to me			0
’ mrs @entity8 accuses @entity32 ( pictured ) of dragging his feet over the court case and hoping she would go away mr @entity1 – whose daughter @entity259 was with prince @entity2 on a controversial boar hunt in @entity261 last week – is a shareholder in @entity48 as well as its managing director and owner of the adjacent @entity265 , where the @entity2 proposed to @entity266 in 2010			1
mr @entity1 and the two companies were found guilty of negligence in 2007 – which they appealed			1
during the long legal battle , it emerged that the lodge manager and mr @entity1 knew a herd of elephant with young had been reported nearby			1
mr @entity1 argued that a ruling against him would damage conservation efforts but mrs @entity8 , now 53 , said : ‘ this case has nothing to do with conservation			1
it ’s about having a duty of care to paying guests			0
‘ neither was it about money			0
i felt a responsibility to try to prevent another family enduring such a horrific experience			0
‘ this ruling sends a message to every lodge in @entity7 and has changed the law there for the better			1
@entity265 now publishes a list of safety regulations , one of which says guests are not allowed out on foot without armed guides			0
’ when asked to comment last night , @entity32 directed @entity39 to a statement on the @entity265 website , which stated : ‘ on february 10 , @entity304 , the @entity265 and @entity32 settled , for an undisclosed sum , the damages awarded to mrs @entity8 and withdrew their appeal			1
' this brings to an end the legal proceedings in the case			0
