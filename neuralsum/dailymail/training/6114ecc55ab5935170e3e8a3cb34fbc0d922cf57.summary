fantasy author @entity0 , whose ' @entity4 ' book series has been turned into the hit @entity6 program ' @entity1 , ' has a new book being released this week , which includes what he says are faithful renderings of the landmarks and castles fans know and love			1
@entity0 's book is ' @entity16 : the @entity17 of @entity18 and the @entity1 , ' and offers 300 pages of back story and original artwork by the some of the world 's top fantasy illustrators			1
he agreed to the companion volume in 2006 and expected it would take just a couple of years			0
naturally , it took longer			0
he intended to write some brief text to accompany the drawings , but ended up setting down some 300,000 words , more than enough to make his editor 's ' head explode			2
' ' it was bigger than i anticipated , ' he said during a recent telephone interview , acknowledging that ' @entity16 ' might have delayed still further the next ' @entity4 ' novel			1
' i start these things that i think wo n't take much time and they grow and grow			0
( fans of @entity68 , be advised : @entity0 includes little about the character he has called his favorite			1
he 's saving that for future books )			2
@entity71 spent working on ' @entity16 ' also means time spent on publicity , and on sunday the resident of @entity75 , @entity76 came to @entity77 and appeared before hundreds of fans at @entity80 's 92nd @entity79 dressed all in black - black corduroys , black shirt , and black vest set off by his white hair and beard - he was interviewed on stage by @entity88 critic @entity87 and responded to written questions from the audience			1
a video of the interview was posted online			0
@entity0 was filmed saying at the panel that he had been inspired by @entity94 when imagining @entity46 at the @entity94 , where members of the @entity96 defend @entity97 from what lies beyond - including the @entity99			2
at the edge of the world : @entity0 has said he was inspired by @entity94 when imagining @entity46 at the @entity94 , where the @entity96 guard the edge of @entity103 as seen on tv : @entity105 plays @entity106 , one of the members of the @entity96 on the @entity6 series dramatic : the @entity109 at @entity46 is seen perched on the edge of steep cliffs adapted : the @entity109 's design appears much taller and narrower on tv not yet ! ' @entity4 ' author @entity0 , seen in july 2014 , has not yet released the next book , ' @entity115 ' speaking about the @entity46 , @entity0 also said at the panel ' nobody ever got it right			1
there were comic book versions , and there were versions in the card game and the board game , and there were versions on the cover [ of books ] , and there were versions that were done for conventions			2
. there was a wooden one that i sat on in 1996			0
. but none of them were ever really right			0
' ' i said repeatedly the @entity46 is huge , ' he also said			0
' it towers over the room like a great beast			0
and it 's ugly ; it 's asymmetric			2
it 's put together by blacksmiths not by craftsmen and experts in furniture manufacture			2
and you have to walk the iron steps , and when a king sits on it he 's like 10 feet above everybody else in the hall so he 's in this raised position looking down on everyone			0
' @entity0 was also filmed saying the @entity53 , the former fortress of the @entity54 , ' has been a b * * * * because it 's really a unique castle			1
you know some of this is very easy for me as a writer to describe , but it 's not necessarily easy for the artist to draw			0
' winter is coming : large towers are seen on the top of the @entity171 stronghold @entity169 the @entity172 remembers : @entity169 is a much lower structure on the hit @entity6 fantasy program @entity0 , 66 , has completed five of seven planned novels : the most recent , ' @entity179 , ' came out in 2011 , the same year the @entity178 - winning @entity6 adaptation ' @entity1 ' first aired			1
@entity0 said sunday that one challenge is keeping track of so many characters and events spread out over thousands of pages			1
like a filmmaker hiring a continuity director , he works with longtime ' @entity4 ' experts @entity188 and @entity189 , who run the fan site http://www.westeros.org and are credited as co-authors of the new book			1
' they displayed , right away , an almost obsessive knowledge of my world			0
in fact , i had to alter my world because of that obsessive knowledge , ' @entity0 said in his phone interview , noting that they had caught errors in his work			1
a native of @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity0 loved comic books and writing as a kid and by high school had won an award for a superhero story			1
he has been publishing books since the 1970s and began his ' @entity4 ' series in the 1990s , intending to write a trilogy			2
during his telephone interview with the @entity215 , @entity0 said some of his fondest early memories were of reading illustrated versions of ' @entity219 ' and other classics and that he wanted ' @entity16 ' to have a similar appeal			1
he admires the @entity222 , but prefers reading on paper and thinks the new book is especially suited for its hardcover edition			0
' my feeling was " let 's make it a coffee table book and let 's fill it with some great fantasy art by some of the top illustrators in the fantasy world , " ' he said			1
' we 're at a time in publishing history where you can have you stories in many different ways			0
but i 'm still an old fart			0
i love a physical book			0
