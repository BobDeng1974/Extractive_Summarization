by the end the @entity1 players were all smiles , cavorting in a corner celebrating a famous @entity6 victory in front of their fans			1
@entity10 , who might have been at the @entity11 ’ @entity6 had the @entity12 @entity6 pushed harder for his inclusion , was at the centre of a scrum of ecstatic players , as two goals in the last seven minutes plucked an unlikely victory from a day which had seem likely to end in bitter recriminations			1
and amidst all the joy , even @entity22 , by then on the bench , might have found a moment to smile			1
the @entity26 striker has only been in @entity27 for a fortnight and his first impressions of the country ca n’t be altogether positive			2
it was the @entity26 striker ’s first start , having played 25 minutes last weekend in the defeat to @entity34			2
at @entity35 he missed a simple chance on ten minutes from close range in an otherwise energetic and good performance but that was n’t the worst of it			1
@entity1 scored twice in the final 10 minutes to come from behind and dump @entity35 out of the @entity6 at @entity42 @entity35 took the lead after @entity44 sent @entity45 , who was making his debut , the wrong way from the penalty spot the @entity27 winger celebrates his goal for @entity35 in the @entity6 , it was his second goal in two games after he scored in the @entity53 @entity44 leaps in celebration in front of the @entity35 supporters , many of whom take photographs on their phones @entity1 striker @entity61 scores an equaliser in the 86th minute to take the tie to a replay @entity10 celebrates after scoring the winning goal in added time in north @entity66 @entity35 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : vorm 6.5 , chiriches 6.5 , @entity67 6 , @entity68 6.5 , @entity69 7 ; @entity70 6 , @entity71 6.5 ( @entity72 87 ) ; @entity44 7.5 ( @entity73 64 - 6 ) , @entity74 6.5 , @entity75 6.5 ; @entity76 7.5 ( @entity77 71 )			1

his bewilderment with the mores of our game must have reached a peak on 42 minutes when he sprinted on to a through ball from @entity110			2
for all the late drama , what happened next occupied centre stage of the afternoon ’s entertainment			2
goalkeeper @entity115 came charging out , missed the ball and took the man in the penalty area			1
a red card and a penalty seemed inevitable			2
instead , referee @entity101 reached with a flourish for a yellow card for diving and pointed in the opposite direction for a @entity35 free kick			1
@entity125 on the bench looked so surprised that he bypassed anger for utter incredulity			2
even @entity115 looked a little apologetic , placing an arm around @entity130			2
‘ he ’s a bit bemused by it , ’ said @entity125			0
‘ he did n’t quite understand			0
but we have to address this situation at some point			0
it ’s an honest mistake			0
it ’s not done on purpose but i ’m a big believer in the fact we need to introduce more technology to aid the officials			0
' we can have replays and you in th press have monitors and can see incidents very quickly after they occur so there should n’t be an issue with having another official who can see replays			0
‘ i do n’t see any point ranting and raving about it – and i suppose you could say it ’s easy to say that now you ’ve won			0
but that ’s how we were at half time			0
it happened ; we ca n’t change it			0
it ’s unfortunate but these sort of things can cost people job but if it ’s a league game and we lose because of a decision like that , maybe i ’d be talking a little bit differently			0
’ it was key moment which might have deflated worse teams			0
but to their credit @entity1 never folded after that decision and never played like a team whose primary focus must be the @entity171			1
one - nil down and aggrieved they stuck to their task doggedly and on 83 minutes came the reward			0
when a corner fell to @entity10 , his attempted shot bounced off the feet of @entity178 , but fell kindly for the @entity179 who turned and shot from the edge of the box , beating @entity115 and racing away in ecstatically to celebrate with the @entity1 fans			1
still , few were expecting the dramatic denouement			0
@entity185 added on had just been announced when @entity186 broke down the right			0
he crossed well and @entity10 met it cleanly but still , it remained a relatively simple save for @entity115			1
somehow he allowed the ball to squirm under him and then deflected the ball into the net as he attempted to recover			0
early on he had made fine saves but it would ultimately have been better for him if he had received that first - half red card			0
@entity115 , who was lucky to still be on the pitch , looks at the ball after @entity61 scored his equaliser @entity1 's record signing @entity22 holds his head in his hands after being booked for diving against @entity35 the @entity207 ' @entity206 striker appeared to have been fouled in the box but referee @entity101 did n't see it that way and booked him for diving @entity115 was lucky to avoid a red card and a penalty after he slid in against @entity22 but missed the ball and took the man @entity35 's @entity216 midfielder @entity74 takes a shot while @entity1 midfielder @entity218 attempts to block it former @entity219 and @entity220 forward @entity76 attempts an acrobatic shot on goal during the second half as for @entity35 the decision to make nine changes from the @entity53 semi final in midweek surely cost them			1
the introductions of @entity73 and @entity72 came too late and that of @entity77 was of limited impact and was greeted by some cheers but plenty of jeers among @entity35 fans			1
the manager claimed the changes were not the reason for the team ’s exit but he now needs to lift them for the second leg against @entity242 on wednesday			0
‘ this is our way from the beginning of the season , ’ said @entity243			0
‘ i do n’t think the changes are a reason to justify the result			0
we ’re very disappointed and upset because when you analyse the game we deserved more			0
during the game we played well , but you need to kill the game and we always gave @entity1 the possibility to stay alive			1
’ @entity243 has some justification in his claims – @entity35 could have won this game but would have had more chance with @entity72 and @entity73 on from the start			2
and with @entity259 in goal , they would not have lost			0
the @entity1 players celebrate on the pitch after the game while a smoke bomb goes off in front of them @entity1 players and supporters celebrate after coming from behind to seal the win in @entity66 @entity1 defender @entity186 rides a challenge from @entity35 's @entity179 midfielder @entity75 @entity35 and @entity1 players clash during the second half of their @entity6 fourth round clash @entity12 striker @entity10 tackles former @entity274 midfielder @entity71 during the first half @entity1 centre back @entity86 had to be substituted during the first half after sustaining an injury @entity22 dribbles down the wing while trying to evade the challenge of @entity35 goalscorer @entity44 foxes striker @entity61 attempts to protect the ball from @entity35 duo @entity282 and @entity70 @entity1 forward @entity91 uses his pace to escape full back rose at @entity42 @entity91 takes a shot during the @entity6 clash , but his effort sails harmlessly over the bar spurs did have to survive early scares – that @entity22 miss , which had seen @entity115 react superbly to push the ball away and a dipping shot from @entity10 on 17 minutes which @entity115 has tipped away one handed			1
but slowly they established a stranglehold on the game , gradually crafting chances			0
they were presented with their opening goal from the penalty spot when @entity86 was tricked into fouling @entity76 , who flicked the ball away to one side while the @entity1 defender simply ploughed on with his challenge regardless , taking out the @entity306			1
@entity44 converted from the spot			2
thereafter @entity35 appeared in control without ever dominating			1
they had the best chances : a header from @entity76 on 33 minutes ; a strike from @entity74 on 35 minutes ; @entity74 should have done better on 70 minutes ; and 42 - year - old debutant @entity45 produced an excellent save from @entity75 on 79 minutes before @entity1 ’s dramatic finale			1

@entity44 opened the scoring for @entity35 after @entity76 was brought down for a penalty
*veteran* goalkeeper @entity45 was making his debut for the foxes
@entity1 's record signing @entity22 booked for diving , although he appeared to have been fouled
but @entity61 and @entity10 scored twice late on to win the tie
