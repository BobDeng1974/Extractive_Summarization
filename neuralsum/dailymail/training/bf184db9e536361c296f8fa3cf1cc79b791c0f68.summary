by @entity0 published : 09:38 est , 22 may 2013 updated : 09:38 est , 22 may 2013 i owe dr @entity2 , the gentle , softly - spoken medic - turned - @entity3 masseuse who slathered my whole body in fragrant sesame oil for an hour , a sincere apology			1
some two - thirds of the way into my decadent session on her massage table , my consciousness suddenly plummeted into the most delicious state of sleep , prompting my leg ( as body - parts are want to do when slipping out of wakefulness ) to involuntarily spasm ... kicking the good doctor in the face			2
it is testament to the power of her soothing hands and flawless technique that i managed so completely to leave life 's stresses at the door of her @entity29 day spa and drift off			1
the award - winning @entity31 practices the ancient @entity34 holistic medical system of @entity3 - a 5000 - year - old system of beliefs meaning ' science of life ' and based on achieving physical and mental harmony with nature but it also left me considering one of her full - body treatments ill - advised if your day 's to - do list is as long as the jubilee line : i left her spa deliriously calm , sublimely happy and went home to take a nice long nap			1
the award - winning @entity31 practices the ancient @entity34 holistic medical system of @entity3 - a 5000 - year - old system of beliefs meaning ' science of life ' and based on achieving physical and mental harmony with nature			1
as a complete way of life , @entity3 comprises diet , yoga , massage , detoxification , herbal remedies , meditation and daily lifestyle , all aimed at improving a person 's health , wellbeing , behaviour and state of mind			2
in other words : massages are essential			0
this is my kind of belief system			0
as dr @entity2 explained to me in her softly - scented room , @entity3 sees everything in the universe - including humans - as composed of five basic elements : space , air , fire , water and earth			1
@entity3 views illness as an imbalance of elements within a person ¿ s constitution			2
its practice aims to restore balance and reinstate health these combine as air and space ( @entity97 ) , fire and water ( @entity100 ) , water and earth ( @entity3 )			0
and while every individual has within them all three forces , it is the concentration of each that makes up a person 's individual constitution , or @entity109			0

and massage can do this			0
so , after holding my wrist and determining my body type ( @entity122 : ambitious , hard - working , hungry , medium build , often with a gap in teeth - all pretty accurate ) , dr @entity2 lay me on her soft table			1
unlike a deep tissue massage , a @entity130 massage or a sports massage , an @entity3 massage is a gentler , smoother , more sensory experience			2
instead of pumelling knots , cracking joints and bending elbows the way they are n't meant to bend , dr @entity2 slathered my whole body in comestible , herb - infused oils ( in @entity3 nothing is put on your skin that can not be put in your mouth ) and swept her palms over me , her hands never leaving my skin			1
her touch - coupled with the soft , plinky - plunky music , the warm , dark room and the soft bed - sent me drifting off into sleep			0
when the hour was up , dr @entity2 gently woke me , allowed me to wash off the oil ( she 'd used enough to deep fry a human whole ) and poured me a fresh herbal tea while i showered , both to rehydrate and to extend the glorious sense of calm and contentedness for a while longer			2
as i floated back out into @entity29 the world seemed somehow muted , less frantic and not quite so urgent			0
to - do list ? what to - do list ? unlike a deep tissue massage , a @entity130 massage or a sports massage , an @entity3 massage is a gentler , smoother , more sensory experience @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 , www.ayurvedapura.com 020 8312 8383			1
