the chancellor was yesterday seen sporting a new style , with his hair brushed forward to cover up signs of a receding hairline			1
the choppy , layered cut is used by hairdressers to make it seem as though their clients ’ hair is thicker than it really is , in turn helping them look younger			1
on view : the chancellor 's receding hairline could previously be seen ( left ) , but the younger style ( right ) gives an impression of more hair on top of his head it seems to have worked for mr @entity5			1
the new style appeared to have taken a few years off the 42 - year - old , who was seen in june with thin and greying hair			2
mr @entity5 was speaking to @entity33 staff in @entity34 after the sale of taxpayer - owned shares			1
the chancellor has hailed the £ 61million profit on the sale of the shares as more evidence the economy was ' turning a corner '			2
mr @entity5 claimed the £ 3.2 billion sale of a 6 per cent slice of the bank to institutional investors represented a half - billion pound boost to the public accounts - because of the way it is valued on the government 's books			0
snip and tuck : mr @entity5 was speaking to @entity33 staff in @entity34 after the sale of taxpayer - owned shares he indicated that the disposal of the rest of the @entity57 's holding , now standing at 32.7 per cent , may be opened up to the public in a stock market float likely to revive memories of the major privatisations of the 1980s			1
it comes five years to the day after then - @entity63 stepped in to swallow up troubled @entity64 during the financial crisis in a disastrous move that saw it needing to be rescued itself in a £ 20 billion @entity51 bail - out			0
the first tranche of the re-privatisation saw financial institutions mainly from the @entity72 and @entity73 snap up stock at a price of 75p per share , above the 73.6p average price that had been paid for it by the @entity57			0
talk : the new style appeared to have taken a few years off mr @entity5 , 42 , who was seen in june with thin and greying hair in a letter to @entity81 , chairman of the @entity82 , mr @entity5 said : ' this is a good outcome for the taxpayer			2
