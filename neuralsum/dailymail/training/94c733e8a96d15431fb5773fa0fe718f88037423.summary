a 25 - year - old writer who was dumped this week via text - after two only dates - has revealed how she sought to exact revenge by contacting the man 's workplace and complaining that he 'd sent her sexting messages using his company @entity9			1
not content with reporting him to his boss , @entity10 also blogged about her experience – a decision that has backfired spectacularly judging from the amount of scorn she has received on countless social media forums since revealing her cruel act of revenge			1
describing herself as ' the @entity21 of literature ' and ' a straight - a @entity25 - @entity24 extrovert from @entity26 with a penchant for vodka , designer shoes and older men , ’ @entity19 - based @entity10 clearly is n’t lacking in confidence although she does lack some self - awareness			2
a recent blog post by @entity34 has earned her a host of negative replies after she revealed her childish reaction to being dumped by a man she had only met twice she 's the editor - in - chief of @entity41 , a website filled with lots of words and pictures devoted to her favorite subject - @entity34			1
in a blog posted entitled ‘ i ’m 26 what ’s a filter ? ’ posted on tuesday she wrote of how two weeks ago she met a random man in a bar			2
‘ he was friendly enough , but annoyingly and sloppily drunk , which is why i offered my email address when he asked for my number			2
we emailed later that weekend , and i met up for a few drinks , which eventually turned to dinner , and then champagne			2
' we had relatively good chemistry , but then , i kinda have chemistry with pretty much everyone , because i really like talking to people and winning over complete strangers , ’ she wrote			0
@entity34 's pompous self - aggrandized claims to be ' a 25 year old with two published books and a condo ' has won her few fans and a host of negative comments the pair had a second date last weekend , which went so well that @entity10 decided to invite the man to her upcoming 26th birthday party , taking place this weekend , to which she has invited her closest 125 friends			1
‘ he would n’t be in town , so he scheduled a weekend in @entity87 wine country the following weekend , ’ she wrote			0
‘ it seemed a bit much , but i agreed to a singular day trip			0
’ but before things could get more serious , @entity10 received a text from her prospective boyfriend the next day in which he unceremoniously dumped her in a rather weaselly fashion			1
in his text , the man - whose name she does n't disclose - gives her that most cliched of breakup lines that he is n’t ‘ looking for a relationship ’ and that he has ‘ no doubt you ’ll move on quickly as you are a funny , smart , cool girl ! ’ @entity10 writes of how her surprise quickly turned to fury on receiving the message			1
@entity10 's two books - ' @entity108 ' and ' @entity109 ' are in fact self - published tomes of her own autobiography which have received a host of negatives reviews on @entity115 ‘ i was stunned into paralysis			1
i had no words – this never happens – and i just felt short of breath			0
' there were many things that pissed me off , but i was so flustered i could n’t even articulate them			0
again , this is a serious problem for a writer and effusive communicator			0
‘ i was still so agitated 10 hours later that i had to leave opera rehearsal early			0
this is a serious no - no , given that opening night is saturday at the @entity129			2
‘ then i realized : i am on the eve of my 26th birthday			0
why am i stewing instead of just expressing what i really feel ? there is practically nothing to lose from just telling the truth			0
’ next , @entity10 revealed how she decided to exact her childish revenge - by sending screen shots of sexting messages they had exchanged to his superiors			1
she justified her actions because he had sent the messages from his ' taxpayer - funded ' work @entity9			1
in her blog she claims her actions were a feminist act for ‘ you , and your girlfriends , moms , grandmothers , daughters , etc ’ because women should ‘ never remain silent in the bombastic , outrageously chauvinistic face of an insecure man			1
’ @entity34 is the editor - in - chief of @entity41 , a website filled with lot of words and pictures devoted to her favorite subject - herself if @entity10 thought that revealing her over-the - top act of revenge was going to win her plaudits for being a ' strong , independent woman , ' she had sorely misjudged her public			1
instead of praise she has attracted a host of negative comments accusing her of being a vain , insecure narcissist			2
' this woman is shameful ! the irony is this blog post was suppose to make her look like some kind of " hero " when really it makes her the villain in this situation			0
she needs to grow up			0
she should be thankful that this man was honest with her , and tried to move on in an adult manner			2
' i do n’t know why she ’s even dating , as she ’s clearly not mature enough to be in a relationship			0
this woman makes us all look bad , ' wrote @entity181			0
@entity10 's pompous self - aggrandized claim to be ‘ a 25 year old with two published books and a condo ' has won her few fans and a whole host of enemies			1
@entity34 's two volumes of self - published memoirs have been labeled ' narcissistic ' and ' pretentious ' one commenter , @entity191 , wrote : ' despite her claim to feminist righteousness , i think she ’s undermining the very cause she purports to support by confusing public vs private issues and using a movement to justify her poorly - formed emotional - coping skills			1
' her two books - ' @entity108 ' and ' @entity109 ' - it turns out are self - published tomes of her own autobiography			1
both are available via @entity115 where they too have attracted a great deal of scorn			0
' this girl has problems			0
she is narcissistic and pretentious , ' wrote mr @entity206			0
' the author is in live with herself , despite her complete lack of any real accomplishments ( no , your trendy @entity213 lifestyle does n't count ) or personal likeability , ' wrote @entity215			2
' how narcissistic do you have to be to self - publish two memoirs by age 26 without having done anything of note , ' wrote @entity221 ? it is n’t clear what has happened to her unnamed ex. the sexting messages are unlikely to cause him more than some embarrassment in front of his boss - or his boss might tell him he has had a lucky escape from miss @entity229 .			1

the self - published author and blogger sought revenge by forward sexting messages she 'd received from her ex to his boss
