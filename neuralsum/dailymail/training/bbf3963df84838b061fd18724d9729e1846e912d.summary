we 're constantly being told to floss , rinse and brush our teeth in a certain way			1
and even the experts ca n't decide the best way to clean our gnashers , according to a new report			0
now , however , a professor of dentistry claims to have come up with the definitive answer - and it 's a lot easier than you might think			0
a horizontal brushing motion , with the brush held like a pencil at a 45 degree angle , is sufficient to access dental plaque , they add			1
in fact , there is little point in getting to grips with elaborate brushing techniques - or in cleaning your teeth hours after eating sweets or consuming a sugary drink - because acid is produced within two minutes of the first bite or sip			1
the researchers was prompted by the wealth of conflicting advice from dentists , dental associations , toothbrush and toothpaste manufacturers on the ideal way to brush			1
professor @entity45 advises people to : ‘ @entity47 gently with a simple horizontal scrubbing motion , with the brush at a forty - five degree angle to get to the dental plaque			1
‘ to avoid brushing too hard , hold the brush with a pencil grip rather than a fist			1
this simple method is perfectly effective at keeping your gums healthy			2
dentist dr @entity58 , who carried out the study , said : ‘ i advise my patients to focus their brushing on areas where plaque is most likely to collect - the biting surfaces and where the teeth and gums meet - and to use a gentle scrubbing motion			1
' @entity45 , @entity69 professor of @entity70 , said the advice on how we should brush is ‘ unacceptably inconsistent '			2
‘ the public needs to have sound information on the best method to brush their teeth , ' he said			0
‘ if people hear one thing from a dental association , another from a toothbrush company and something else from their dentist , no wonder they are confused about how to brush			1
‘ in this study we found an unacceptably inconsistent array of advice from different sources			0
‘ dental associations need to be consistent about what method to recommend , based on how effective the method is			0
‘ most worryingly , the methods recommended by dental associations are not the same as the best ones mentioned in dental textbooks			0
‘ there is no evidence to suggest that complicated techniques are any better than a simple gentle scrub			0
’ according to the study , which was published in the @entity103 , the most commonly - recommended technique involves gently jiggling the brush back and forth in small motions , with the intention of shaking loose any food particles , plaque and bacteria			2
but no study has showed whether this is as effective as basic scrubbing , he said			0
professor @entity45 advised people to : ‘ @entity47 gently with a simple horizontal scrubbing motion , with the brush at a 45 degree angle to get to the dental plaque			1
‘ to avoid brushing too hard , hold the brush with a pencil grip rather than a fist			2

experts say the advice on how to best care for our teeth is ' unacceptably inconsistent ' ‘ there is little point in brushing after eating sweets or sugary drinks to prevent tooth decay			1
it takes bacteria from food about two minutes to start producing acid , so if you brush your teeth a few minutes after eating sugary foods , the acid will have damaged the enamel			0
dentist dr @entity58 , who carried out the study , said : ‘ the wide range of recommendations we found is likely due to the lack of strong evidence suggesting that one method is conclusively better than another			0
‘ i advise my patients to focus their brushing on areas where plaque is most likely to collect - the biting surfaces and where the teeth and gums meet - and to use a gentle scrubbing motion			1
‘ all too frequently i am asked why the method i am describing differs from how previous dentists have taught them in the past			0
‘ for something most people do twice a day , you would expect dentists to send a clearer , more unified message to their patients on how to brush their teeth			2
