a trainee lawyer at one of the world 's biggest law firms has posted a rant claiming the @entity6 terror attacks may not have happened if the @entity7 had not ' killed our people and pillaged our resources '			1
@entity11 , 22 , from magic circle law firm @entity12 , criticised @entity13 for allowing their minds to be ' colonised ' and claimed @entity15 was ' superior ' to @entity17 ideology			1
in a 21 - minute @entity20 video posted two days after the kosher supermarket massacre , the lawyer said freedom of speech should not be put on a pedestal ' as though it is some godsend '			1
referring to non-muslims insultingly as ' kuffar ' , he addressed the @entity6 terrorist atrocities , which left 17 people dead , and said that any @entity13 who apologised were offering a ' weak ' response			1
' this , brothers and sisters , is what we need to understand			0
we need to move away from this apologetic tone and have confidence in @entity15 because we are enslaved otherwise			2
' ' we need to remove this @entity17 cultural lens with which we are viewing and responding to attacks on @entity15 from our eyes			2
' stop putting freedom on this pedestal			0
this is a value stemming from secular , liberal beliefs			0
we do n't need a value which stems from a bankrupt ideology			0
' during the video - which was watched 700 times before being removed - he claimed that freedom of speech is an ideal which does not exist in reality			1
' you would n't walk around @entity63 denying the @entity64 , ' he said			0
he said freedom of speech should not be put on a pedestal ' as though it is some godsend ' in a 21 - minute @entity20 video posted two days after the kosher supermarket massacre			2
' the ideal of freedom of speech does n't exist in reality			0
but there seems to be an absolute freedom to insult @entity13			1
' the people being held out as @entity15 personalities with an @entity15 response are not giving a correct @entity15 response			2
you [ @entity13 ] have to accept their [ @entity7 ' ] freedom to insult you			1
' that is what freedom of speech means [ in the @entity7 ] … i guess @entity13 just need to grow up , is the concept they want to put across			1
' he calls freedom of speech a ' bankrupt ideology ' , adding : ' we are becoming infatuated with the civilisation of the kuffar and their beliefs and their values and indeed we have latched on to these			2
' now you know who you are if you are of those who state ' i will die to protect your freedom and i believe in freedom of speech '			0
the @entity103 brothers were filmed by eyewitnesses in a @entity6 street after they 'd slaughtered 11 members of the @entity108 editorial team in cold blood ' but understand that it is not the @entity15 response to this issue			1
it represents a defeatist mentality , brothers and sisters			0
it is understood the trainee started at @entity12 six months ago and earns £ 40,500 per year			1
the 22 - year - old from @entity121 , east @entity119 has now offered a grovelling apology claiming that he just wanted to encourage intellectual debate			1
he said : ' i apologise for any offence caused by my video			2
i have a deep and serious @entity15 faith , i had no intention other than to encourage intellectual debate and would never support or condone violence			1
' @entity12 insisted today that the firm did not share the views of mr @entity11 , pictured is the headquarters in @entity137 @entity12 insisted today that the firm did not share the views of mr @entity11 , who works in their mergers and acquisitions department			1
but the firm refused to comment on whether he would be would lose his job or face any disciplinary action			1
a spokesman for the firm said : ' the views expressed in this video are personal and not those of @entity12			1
' the firm is committed to establishing an inclusive culture where people with diverse backgrounds and views work effectively together and feel confident to develop their potential			2
' we ask our people at all times to consider how their personal conduct and actions may affect those around them , their professional reputation and that of the firm			2
' mr @entity11 's video was posted on january 11 from an account called ' call of @entity166 ' , which describes itself on @entity167 as a ' local @entity15 youth group based in east @entity119 '			1
the video was set to ' private ' three days later but the full video later re-surfaced on @entity20 on an account called ' @entity172 '			0
his @entity174 page has been removed , but it said he gained a first - class honours degree in law from the @entity177 ( @entity177 ) at @entity178			0
before working at @entity12 , he interned at @entity179 , @entity180 , and @entity181			2
speaking outside the family home in @entity121 , east @entity119 , today , his father @entity182 said : ' the whole thing has been totally blown out of proportion			0
' i wo n't pass comment , but if you read his statement that will tell you our stance on it			0
' he 's working hard on a very big project for @entity12 , lots of long hours , so he 's not normally home until very late			1
' but @entity197 , director of @entity198 , a @entity199 - @entity13 interfaith group that tackles religious and political extremism in the @entity201 , said mr @entity11 had used ' the language of terror ' and that @entity12 's response was ' weak '			1
he told @entity205 : ' from our position - and for anyone involved in counter-terror - this is a familiar type of rhetoric , directed at @entity212			0
it is not just political ramblings			0
' we saw it after the @entity217 murder , when @entity218 made similar comments on camera about victimhood in foreign lands			0
' this man might not be directly involved with terror but he is certainly using the langauge of terror			0
i 'm sure he will be someone that the police and security services are going to look at very closely from now on			0
' he added : ' that @entity12 has responded so weakly is deplorable			2
i 'm sure they would have no hesitation in taking immediate disciplinary action against someone with @entity237 views , so i 'm not sure why this is different			0
' i do n't believe any respectable company or organisation would hesistate in taking immediate discplinary action against an employee who has made these comments			0
