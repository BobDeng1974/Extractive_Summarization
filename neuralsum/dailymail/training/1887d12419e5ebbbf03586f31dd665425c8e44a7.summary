a train operator 's most popular morning commuter train to @entity3 did not run on time once in a whole year , statistics have revealed			1
rail company @entity5 failed to get the 7.29am @entity6 to @entity8 train into the capital within its scheduled time on any occasion out of 240 attempts			1
the service is the most essential for commuters who live in @entity6 , @entity14 , but work in @entity3 as it is scheduled to arrive at its final destination at 8.35am - just in time for a 9am start time			1
delayed : rail company @entity5 failed to get the 7.29am @entity6 to @entity8 train into the capital within its scheduled time on any occasion out of 240 attempts last year the revelation comes a week after commuters , some of whom pay up to £ 5,000 a year for a season ticket from @entity6 to @entity3 , were dealt 2.5 per cent price rises on their rail fares from january 2			1
trains either side of the 7.29 service to @entity8 , the 7.14 and the 7.44 , only arrived in the capital on time on 1 per cent and 2 per cent of occasions , according to the new figures released by @entity38			1
nationally , more than a third of trains failed to arrive on time in the 12 months ending december 6 , with 64.6 per cent reaching their destination within 59 seconds of their scheduled arrival			1
only 50.3 per cent of @entity5 trains made it within the 59 - second limit			1
@entity49 deputy managing director @entity48 apologised for poor performance but stressed work was underway to improve the service			1
questioned on whether commuters were getting their money ’s worth last week , he declined to answer yes or no. work : @entity49 deputy managing director @entity48 apologised for poor performance but stressed work was underway to improve the service ' i do n’t think we ’re delivering the level of performance customers expect , ' he said			1
' we are delivering in a lot of areas , including investment and innovation , but not on performance			0
we ’re doing more in that area , that ’s a major area we ’re focusing on			0
' @entity5 say the poor performance of the 7.29 train and other services across the network is primarily down to high demand and congestion			1
however the 7.29 service was cancelled twice last week - on one occasion because of a faulty door lock			2
asked what the problem was with the 7.29 , mr @entity48 said it was ' all because of the balance between capacity and performance on the network '			2
he said : ' our network is very busy and congested			1
an analogy that i ’d use is the @entity90 at its busiest time			2
our network is a bit like that and what we ’re trying to do is run as many trains as we can because the capacity is needed			1
people want those trains , want seats on the trains , want trains to be as long as they can because there is demand for it			2
' but it does mean that trains are running very , very close together - particularly as they approach @entity3			2
if there is the most minor of problem or delay on a train , another train can be thrown off its path or slot on the network by a couple of minutes which can sometimes then snowball a little to five or six minutes late			2
' we ’ve identified some issues with the 7.29 , with the way it interacts with other services , but the timetable and the capacity demand is so intense that some of the options of what we can do are quite limited			0
' @entity5 gained more than £ 700 million in revenue in 2013			1
its parent company @entity127 - a firm jointly - owned by the @entity130 national railway company @entity131 - last year received more than £ 700 million in net public subsidies from taxpayers			1
its shareholders also enjoyed more than £ 21 million in dividends			0
mr @entity48 added : ' there ’s the delay repay system which compensates passengers for delays over a certain threshold , but i think it ’s worth reflecting if you look back over the @entity5 franchise , that we ’ve done a tremendous amount of work			1
destination : trains either side of the 7.29 service to @entity8 ( pictured ) , the 7.14 and the 7.44 , arrived in the capital on time on 1 per cent and 2 per cent of occasions , according to figures released by @entity38 busy period : asked what the problem was with @entity5 's 7.29 service , mr @entity48 said it was ' all because of the balance between capacity and performance on the network ' ' i ’d ask people to reflect on how the network has changed over the past decade , say			1
we ’ve introduced a complete new fleet of trains , the @entity170 fleet , we ’ve introduced extra seats from @entity6 and in fact a lot of those trains still have spare capacity today			0
' we ’ve invested hugely in stations , and @entity6 station is a great example of the work that ’s been done			0
' we will continue to work on performance but it ’s about setting that off against successes as well that i think we ’ve achieved on the network			1
' in an attempt to reassure customers , mr @entity48 concluded : ' there are a number of other changes coming this year , including a timetable recast in december			0
' @entity5 becomes part of @entity192 in july and that gives us the opportunity to review the @entity6 mainline timetable and to construct it in a better way			1
we ’re out for consultation on that at the moment			0
' @entity200 , @entity201 mp for @entity202 , who commutes most days to the capital from @entity6 , has called for an urgent summit to address the ongoing rail misery impacting her constituents			0
campaign : @entity200 , @entity201 mp for @entity202 , who commutes most days to the capital from @entity6 , has called for an urgent summit to address the rail misery impacting her constituents ' my constituents are fed up with unreliable , overcrowded and over-priced trains , ' she said			1
' i ’ve been inundated by letters and emails from passengers who have had to experience cancelled trains , late running services , overcrowded trains and platforms , and pitiful communications systems			0
she added : ' longer term , we need to fix the fragmentation of our railway system through bringing rail back into public ownership			0
' commuters on the service also had their say on the delays , and offered their ideas for a possible solution			1
train user @entity232 , from @entity6 said : ' i do n’t expect to arrive on time			1
the train always slows down			0
the @entity235 put up with it but it ’s always been the same , trains have always been bad in this country			0
' where is there a good train service in the @entity243 ? should we renationalise ? i mean , on certain levels yes			0
' but i ca n’t see how doing that will make it a better service because when it was nationalised it was rubbish then as well			0
' on a different level , maybe it should be but it wo n’t make a great deal of difference			0
do @entity5 staff get performance - related pay ? maybe that will help			1
' @entity258 , 24 , from @entity6 , said : ' you budget 10 to 15 minutes for the end of the journey on this train			0
it ’s always late , it never fails			0
it ’s a case of putting up with it as far as i ’m concerned			0
' you should n’t have to assume your train is going to be late every time , you should have dedicated times for your arrival so you can plan your commute to work			2
' if targets are n’t met then some money back on a season ticket would be nice			0
' you could also adjust the timetable so the arrival time is 10 or 15 minutes later			0
that way people wo n’t be misled and @entity5 will hit their targets			2
' @entity282 , 44 , from @entity6 : ' to hear that this train never arrived on time in @entity3 at all last year is absolutely of no surprise to me			2
i ca n’t remember when it did			0
' it ’s scheduled to arrive at 8.35 which should be enough time to get to work for 9am			1
but what i have to do , if i have an important meeting , is get up earlier and get the earlier train			0
that is still late most of the time too but at least i can make work on time			2
' there ’s also a receptionist at my work in @entity3 who also gets this train from @entity6 and i ’ve heard from her myself that it ’s a real problem for her too - like everyone else			0
it just seems to go slowly when it nears @entity3 and you lose time			0
' one of the best performing operators was the @entity308 train company , which ran 85.1 per cent of its services on time , but the same was true of just 39.1 per cent of services from @entity313			2
the right - time @entity38 figures for the 12 months ending december 6 2014 , also showed that @entity315 , c2c , and @entity316 all had on - time figures in excess of 80 per cent			0
contrastingly , only 45.6 per cent of @entity320 ’s trains were on time and only 50.9 per cent of @entity323 ’ services were on time			2
@entity38 ’s performance is judged not on the right - time measure but on the public performance measure ( @entity328 ) which deems a commuter service is on time if its arrives within five minutes of scheduled time , with long - distance trains being on time if they arrive within 10 minutes			1
on this five - minute @entity328 measure , just 27 per cent of the 7.29am @entity6 to @entity3 trains were on time last year			1
the @entity328 figures for all train companies showed that for the 12 months ending december 6 2014 , a total of 89.3 per cent of trains were on time			2
top operator was c2c with a punctuality figure of 96.4 per cent , while the worst - performing company was southern with a figure of 83.4 per cent			0
a spokesman for @entity5 said : ' we acknowledge that the performance of the 7.29am @entity6 to @entity8 service has been particularly disappointing			1
' this is a train that we know has a poor @entity328 record and although we ’re working hard to improve its performance , its planned path is extremely tight because the network is so busy			2

rail company @entity5 's morning service failed to run on time last year
service is used by commuters as it is scheduled to arrive at 8.35am
nationally more than a third of trains failed to arrive on time
just 64.6 *%* reached destination within 59 seconds of scheduled time
@entity5 says delays caused by busy network during the morning rush hour and improvement work is underway
