the scrap of papyrus claiming @entity2 had a wife , which was dismissed by the @entity5 as a modern forgery , has been authenticated as a genuine ancient document			1
scientists from several prestigious @entity10 universities have said it was written between the fourth and eight centuries			1
the fragment of papyrus is written in ancient @entity15 and reads : ' @entity2 said to them , " my wife " ' and ' … she will be able to be my disciple … ' the discovery of a scrap of papyrus that claimed @entity2 had a wife caused a holy row of words in the @entity27 over its authenticity - but @entity10 scientists say it is ancient the papyrus ’ back side , or verso , is so badly damaged that only a few key words - ' my mother ' and ' three ' - were decipherable , but on the front side , or recto , professor @entity36 gleaned eight fragmentary lines : historians and religious leaders have been clamouring to both prove and deny the artefact 's credibility after it was shown to the world around 18 months ago by @entity46 professor @entity36			1
some experts have claimed that if the papyrus is true , it could be used to prove that @entity2 was married instead of celibate , which could undermine one of the @entity53 's main teachings			1
a furious @entity5 newspaper dismissed the find as a fake in an editorial by its editor , @entity58 who wrote a stinging piece entitled ' at any rate , a fake , ' which questioned the document 's authenticity			1
the new study , published in the @entity65 , revealed the results of the latest carbon dating tests to be carried out on the document , which was found to date to eighth century @entity69 , around 400 years later than professor @entity36 originally thought , the @entity63 reported			1
additional tests showed that the ink ’s chemical composition is consistent with other inks used by the ancient @entity69 , while microscopic imaging found no suspicious ink pooling that critics of the papyrus said was evidence of the ink being applied in more recent times			2
controversy : @entity36 announced the finding at an international congress on coptic studies in @entity85 in 2012 and the @entity5 as well as others reacted furiously to some interpretations of the ancient fragment , which is written in @entity15 critics have said that the fragment is a collage of pieces of the @entity93 by someone with a dubious grasp of ancient @entity15			1
one scholar even claims to have found a typo in an online edition of the gospel , which matches one in what they say is a forgery			0
other experts have claimed that ink pooling suggests that the document was created in modern times			0
@entity107 , an egyptologist at @entity108 , said that none of the new tests have convinced him that the papyrus is a fake			2
he wrote in the @entity65 that a forger may have ‘ wanted to put his or her own spin on modern theological issues ’ such as celibacy and the role of women in the @entity53			2
‘ as a forgery , it is bad to the point of being farcical or fobbish			0
. i do n’t buy the argument that this is sophisticated			0
i think it could be done in an afternoon by an undergraduate student , ’ he said			0
the provenance of the papyrus has also been questioned			0
the owner of the document has asked to remain anonymous but said that he acquired the artefact along with five other papyri in 1999 from a collector who got them in the 1960s in @entity135			0
at the time the papyrus was originally revealed , the @entity5 was joined by a @entity138 scholar in calling the ancient papyrus a ' fake '			1
@entity141 expert professor @entity140 of @entity142 said that the fragment is a collage of texts from the @entity93 , copied and reassembled out of order in bad ancient @entity15			1
but professor @entity36 said : ‘ i ’m basically hoping that we can move past the issue of forgery to questions about the significance of this fragment for the history of @entity154 , for thinking about questions like , “ why does @entity2 being married , or not , even matter ? ” why is it that people had such an incredible reaction to this ? ’ the papyrus , which is roughly the size of a business card , appears to have been written much later than the gospels of the @entity141 , which are considered to be the earliest and therefore the most reliable sources of information about the life of @entity167			1
professor @entity36 thinks that the text was copied from an earlier document , perhaps written in @entity170 , and thinks it is important in showing how @entity154 spread through the @entity172			0
the papyrus has now been examined by electrical engineering , chemistry and biology experts from @entity177 , @entity46 and the @entity178 ( @entity178 ) who have declared that the parchment is indeed several hundred years old , according to the @entity180			2
the scientists emphasised that while they have authenticated its age , their examination of the papyrus does not prove that @entity2 was married			1
professor @entity36 said in 2012 that her 8cm by 4cm find ' does not provide evidence that the historical @entity2 was married , ’ but she did say it caused people to question @entity2 ' marital status			1
ancient : the back side , or verso , of the papyrus is so badly damaged that only a few key words - ' my mother ' and ' three ' - are decipherable many people over the centuries have tried to work out a ' bloodline ' for possible descendants of @entity2 and @entity201			1
many historians agree that there is no historical , biblical , archaeological or genetic evidence to support the idea			0
but the fragment of papyrus that is said to be a translation of a lost gospel has @entity2 referring to ' my wife ' a 13th century @entity212 monk and historian @entity211 claimed that @entity2 had a relationship with @entity201			1
early @entity216 leaders stated that @entity2 as polygamous based upon an obscure passage attributed to a second century @entity170 philosopher called @entity219			2
in the 19th century , a politician called @entity221 published a ' history ' book that claimed @entity2 was married to @entity201 and that they both travelled to the @entity224 where they had a son			0
subsequent books have claimed @entity2 fathered a child with @entity201 - or possibly had more offspring with a @entity231 woman			0
author @entity232 interviewed one person who claimed to be a @entity231 descendant of @entity2			0
@entity201 has also been said to be the mother of @entity236 , while another author claims @entity2 and @entity201 are the ancestors of all the @entity240 royal families			0
professor @entity36 originally interpreted the document as a debate about celibacy			0
‘ now when i come back and read the fragment , it seems the major issue being talked about was that @entity2 was affirming that wives and mothers can be his disciples , ’ she said in an interview earlier this week			2
one interpretation of the papyrus is that if it is talking about the wife of @entity2 , the document could cast doubt on a centuries old official representation of @entity201 as a repentant whore and overturns the @entity154 ideal of sexual abstinence			1
at the time the papyrus was announced , professor @entity36 told @entity259 that the fragment casts doubt ' on the whole @entity263 claim of a celibate priesthood based on @entity2 ’ celibacy			1
' she said : ' what this shows is that there were early @entity270 for whom ... sexual union in marriage could be an imitation of @entity275 ’s creativity and it could be spiritually proper and appropriate			0
' professor @entity36 speculated that the so - called ' @entity277 ' may have been thrown out ' because the ideas it contained flowed so strongly against the ascetic currents of the tides in which @entity154 practices and understandings of marriage and sexual intercourse were surging			0
' this representation of @entity2 as a man with earthly passions and needs has not survived in the doctrines of the established churches , which emphasise celibacy and asceticism as a spiritual ideal			2
the document was originally carbon dated by the @entity297 to between 200 and 400 years before the birth of @entity2 , while a second test by @entity46 produced an average date of @entity301			2
experts at @entity177 tested the ‘ ancient ’ ink using a technique called @entity306 spectroscopy to examine its chemical composition before comparing it to other similar documents in its collection			0
@entity167 appearing to the @entity312 by @entity313 : the ancient papyrus arguably suggests the @entity315 and @entity201 , pictured , were man and wife but professor @entity36 is keen to stress that this is not proven			2

experts from @entity10 universities used carbon dating to prove the fragment is ancient and was written between the fourth and eighth centuries
the fragment is written in ancient @entity15 and reads ' @entity2 said to them , " my wife " ' which if true could shake up the @entity53 's views on celibacy
the @entity5 dismissed the 8cm by 4cm piece of papyrus as a fake when it was unveiled in 2012 and some experts remain in agreement
