from regulations for the length of beards to bans on food , it seems some bosses have created rules - and refused to budge - just because they can			1

@entity5 , 16 , said by her high school principal to be a good kid , was expelled and charged with explosives offences for an experiment that went wrong last week			1
she was mixing aluminum foil and toilet cleaner in an 8oz water bottle before school when the elements reacted and caused an explosion			1
although she said she was just curious to see what happened - and had the good school grades to back this up - she was expelled from @entity41 in @entity42 because they had to stick to school rules over unsupervised explosives			1
with @entity5 's story in mind , @entity3 users shared their worst experience of ' rules are rules ' being taken to the extreme by jobsworth managers			1
the most popular tale regarded cell phones at a laser tag arena , trying to combat the problem of younger workers finding creative ways to get round the cell phone ban			1

another government rule on food and personal items was proved to be bananas			2
' people used to keep snacks on their desk while working , because we 're human			2
' the employer implemented " lean working " so every desk had to be totally empty , except for select items that had to be arranged in a certain way ( pens had to be to the upper left of the keyboard , i think )			2
' this rule forbid food items , but allowed one " personal item "			2
one staff member had a banana in a banana case as her personal item			0
she was told to put it away			0
one woman tried to get round the ' no food ' rule by claiming an ' inactive ' banana in a banana case was a personal item ' she refused and took it further until it was ruled that because she was n't eating it and the skin had n't been broken , it was an " inactive banana " and thus a personal item			0
it only became active during the act of eating , at which point it became food			0

one office banned water bottles - only allowing workers to drink from a small cup while the simple act of supplying the printer and fax machines had its own rules , too			1
' moving a single box without a dolly was breaking the rules			1
