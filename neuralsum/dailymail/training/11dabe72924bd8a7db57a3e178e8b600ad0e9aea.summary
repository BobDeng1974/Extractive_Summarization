by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:11 est , 6 september 2012 updated : 12:54 est , 6 september 2012 convicted : @entity2 was sentenced to 25 years in jail for the murder of his second wife , but now he may have an earlier crime to deal with a man who was convicted of killing his mail order bride may have gotten away with the murder of a previous girlfriend , it was revealed today			1
@entity2 was sentenced to 25 years in prison after his daughter @entity13 testified that her father strangled his second wife @entity15 and forced her to help him hide the body in a @entity18 national park			1
now @entity18 police are calling on authorities in @entity2 's old hometown of @entity22 , @entity23 to reopen the investigation into his former girlfriend @entity25 who ' drowned '			1
the @entity26 reports that during his trial , @entity2 's history of abuse came to light , and apparently that extended back to both of his wives and former girlfriends			1
@entity2 's turbulent romantic history dates back to when he began a pen pal relationship with @entity36 who eventually moved from the @entity38 to @entity23 in 1981 to marry him and have his child , @entity13			1
during his recent trial , ms @entity36 told the court that she was abused repeatedly during her marriage to @entity2			1
at one point , she wrote to her sister in the @entity38 saying that if she went missing , her husband would be the reason			0
in 1992 , ms @entity36 took @entity13 - who was also abused by @entity2 - and fled to @entity18			1
he stayed behind and began dating ms @entity25 , a @entity48 woman who died two months after they moved in together			0
the circumstances surrounding her death , though formally ruled a drowning , were suspicious to one local detective but @entity2 filed a complaint about that officer and he was removed from the case			1
' there were a lot of red flags , ' lieutenant @entity57 , one of the investigators , told the @entity26			0
' one of the original officers , i learned secondhand , was highly suspicious			0
but @entity2 complained about him , and the officer was ultimately told to drop it			1
' not for swimming : @entity2 's ex girlfriend @entity25 was found having ' drowned ' in @entity71 in @entity72 , @entity23 back in 1993 date night : the then - couple who had been living together for two months , went to dinner at @entity75 ( like the one seen here in neighboring @entity77 ) before going to the wildlife area that is not normally used for swimming on the night of her death , ms @entity25 and @entity2 had dinner at a local @entity75 before they went to the @entity71 , which is not typically used for swimming			1
the fact that ms @entity25 , who worked at a local university , was a champion swimmer , was found wearing a purple jumpsuit and shoes , had abrasions to her face consistent with being smothered , and torn clothing near her pelvis suggesting possible unwanted intercourse were overlooked by investigators			0
as was the fact that she only eight feet away from shallow water			0
in spite of the clues that suggest another reason for her death , it was ruled a drowning			0
known victim : @entity103 was killed in 2005 but her husband was n't arrested until 2001 after his stepdaughter confessed to helping him hide the body according to @entity2 's criminal record , and the @entity26 , his string of domestic abuse did n't end there			1
shortly after ms @entity25 's death , he moved to @entity18 and began dating @entity112 , an immigrant from @entity113 who worked at @entity114			0
she left him in 1996 immediately after he hit her and strangled her to the point where she almost lost consciousness			0
to cover his bases , he reported ms @entity112 to police because she was in the country illegally , and she was deported			2
the crime that sent him to jail , however , was from the relationship that followed when he began another pen pal relationship with @entity15 who went on to be his second wife			2
the first break in the @entity15 's case came in april of 2008 – three years after she had gone missing – when her skull was found by hikers in @entity130 near @entity131			0
her identity remained a mystery until 2010 when a dna profile and dental records showed that the skull matched that of the missing woman , according to the @entity139			0
then in 2011 , @entity140 , his daughter from his first marriage who was then 26 - years - old , walked into a police station and said that her father had strangled her stepmother and ordered her to help remove the body from their home			1
miss @entity103 explained her decision to come forward with information about the murder by saying that she ‘ could no longer live with the guilt , ’ prosecutors said			2
she was also apparently being threatened by her father to keep quiet			0
during her father ’s two - and - a - half - week trial , @entity140 testified against him and was not charged in the case			0
‘ it took a lot of courage and strength for her to come forward , ’ said deputy district attorney @entity158			0
confirmed scene : @entity2 dumped the body of his second wife @entity15 in the @entity166 in often emotional testimony , @entity2 said that as a 19 - year - old , she got a call from her father shortly before midnight on march 8 , 2005 , asking for her help			1
when she arrived at the house , @entity2 told her that he had choked his wife to death and she was lying dead in an upstairs bathtub			1
he needed his daughter ’s assistance in getting her out of the house and burying her			2
the 26 - year - old said she had agreed to carry the body , but refused to inter it			2
instead , she remained inside her father ’s @entity181 while he disposed of his wife in the @entity166			2
the jury did not believe @entity2 ’s line of defense that he killed his wife accidentally and in self - defense when she allegedly attacked him with knife , prosecutors said			1
it took the jury only one day of deliberations to convict mr @entity2			2
in the course of the trial , witnesses testified that @entity103 was abused so severely at the hands of her husband that friends smuggled her from her house , hidden under a blanket in the back seat of a car			0
neighbors told the jury about mrs @entity103 ‘ running to their home in the middle of the night , shaking like a mouse with bruises on her throat , saying he tried to kill her , ’ @entity158 told the @entity26			0
miss @entity103 said she too was subjected to abuse at the hands of her father , although @entity158 said his star witnesses told him she still loves her dad			0
confession : @entity140 , who was 19 at the time that her father killed his second wife , said that her father threatened her in order to keep her quiet but then the guilt just became too much ‘ she just felt so bad for @entity15 and @entity15 's family that she could not carry it around anymore , ’ @entity158 said			2
according to testimony , detectives asked @entity2 for his wife 's dental records so they could match it to teeth if remains were found			1
they believe that caused @entity2 to panic and remove the skull from his wife ’s decomposing body , which he then concealed in the spot where it was later discovered by hikers			1
the rest of @entity103 ’s remains were never located , and her husband has told investigators they must have been carried off by wild animals .			0

@entity2 was arrested last year for the 2005 murder of his second wife
police could only charge him after his daughter from his first marriage admitted that she helped him hide the body
now questions being raised about his girlfriend who ' drowned ' in 1993
