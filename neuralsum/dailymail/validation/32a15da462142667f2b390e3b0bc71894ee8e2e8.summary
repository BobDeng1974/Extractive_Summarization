what is the last thing you remember about @entity3 and @entity4 ? for @entity3 , it is most likely him tearing @entity7 champions @entity6 apart , making them look like a @entity9 team lost in @entity10 , nutmegging @entity11 to leave him with grass stains on his backside			1
for @entity4 , it may be him throwing his arm in the air in disdain , sulking back to the halfway line , protesting even though team - mate @entity19 had just put @entity20 1 - 0 up against @entity21			2
@entity3 may well be priceless as the @entity23 star continues to find the best form of his career @entity3 smiles during @entity23 's win over @entity6 that knocked them out of the @entity28 @entity4 can not mask his frustration during @entity20 's last match against @entity21 it was a tough night for @entity4 , who will need to improve fast for @entity33 against @entity3 's @entity23 it is an unforgiving game for the two undisputed best players on the planet			1
yet there is currently no debate to be had			0
the headlines this week belong to @entity3 , even if he did n't break a @entity28 record on wednesday and his free - kicks served only to remind us he is human after all			0
there was more to his embarrassment of @entity6 than missing out on his ninth goal in the tournament			0
if it was n't his menacing dribbles , it was his six shots against a magnificent @entity51			0
if it was n't his assist for @entity55 's goal , it was his nutmeg on @entity11 that reduced @entity56 – the architect of the @entity23 way and current @entity60 manager – to nothing more than another supporter in the stands			1
the one - twos , the drops of the shoulder , the shimmies			0
@entity56 has seen it all before – at the @entity69 , at their @entity71 training ground , at almost every stadium he took @entity23 to – yet still it was enough for him to hide his face in disbelief			1
@entity23 's @entity3 taunts the @entity6 defence on the edge of the penalty area during another classy performance @entity3 joins in the celebrations after @entity55 's opening goal with @entity83 ( right ) at the @entity69 @entity3 's heat map showed he was very active in the @entity6 half			1
click here for more from our @entity88 service @entity92 paper @entity90 hailed the ' @entity93 after his ' masterclass ' against @entity6 that included ' nutmegs , dribbles and an assist ' , while he also featured on the front cover of @entity100 should we have expected anything less ? @entity3 has been untouchable this year			0
so much so it 's almost unfair , and part of the credit can even go to – dare we say it ? – his nemesis , @entity4			0
it was on january 12 when the @entity20 man got the better of the @entity23 boy for the 2014 @entity111 award , three weeks after @entity4 returned to his hometown of @entity113 on the island of @entity115 to unveil a statue of himself			1
before the @entity111 ceremony , @entity4 beat @entity3 in goals ( 33 to 25 ) , goals per game ( 1.18 to 1 ) , minutes per goal ( 70.94 to 87.24 ) , shots ( 119 to 96 ) , minutes - per - goal involvement ( 52.02 to 58.95 ) and they had 12 assists apiece in all competitions			1
@entity3 sat there in @entity127 , to the left of @entity4 , and gritted his teeth afterwards as he congratulated the man that won with 37.66 per cent of the vote for his third @entity111			1
yet @entity4 's cry of ' @entity133 ' lit something under the four - time winner			2
@entity136 hath no fury like a @entity3 scorned , and he is arguably playing better than when he was crowned the world 's best in 2009 , 2010 , 2011 and 2012			0
since the @entity111 ceremony , there 's been no contest			0
@entity3 beats @entity4 on goals ( 18 to 8 ) , goals per game ( 1.2 to 0.73 ) , minutes per goal ( 75 to 122.75 ) , shots ( 60 to 52 ) , chances created ( 39 to 17 ) , assists ( 9 to 3 ) and minutes - per - goal involvement ( 50 to 89.27 )			2
@entity3 has been outstanding ever since @entity4 won the @entity111 on january 12 and the stats prove it the frustration against @entity21 was written all over @entity4 's face as he leaned against the frame of the goal how the top of @entity156 stands ahead of @entity33 it 's unrecognisable			1
to the overall statistics in all competitions this season , it puts @entity3 ahead in the three major categories : goals ( 43 to 41 ) , assists ( 21 to 15 ) and , comfortably , chances created ( 112 to 68 )			0
down to the brass tacks of @entity156 , too			0
there was a moment on november 22 , when @entity4 had 20 goals to @entity3 's seven			1
yet today , @entity4 has 30 to @entity3 's 32			2
all this has reopened the debate between @entity3 and his great rival that had a dissimilar experience in @entity10 last tuesday			2
@entity4 is congratulated by @entity177 president @entity176 during the @entity111 ceremony in @entity127 ronaldo cry of ' @entity133 ' lit something under four - time winner @entity3 , who has obliterated his form ever since @entity4 must up his game to stay in competition with @entity3 if he is to retain the @entity111 next year @entity4 , for a man that had broken the @entity28 goalscoring record , left the pitch shaking his head following a 4 - 3 defeat by @entity192 at the @entity193			2
those all - too - familiar white handkerchiefs were waved in his team 's direction , and the @entity92 whistles were piercing			0
' i wo n't talk again until the end of the season , ' @entity4 announced afterwards , as frustrated as any , while a poll by @entity92 newspaper as found 32.2 per cent voted for @entity4 to be dropped			0
all is not right in @entity4 's world , and he has been putting in additional work this week at the @entity206 training ground in @entity207			1
@entity3 , meanwhile , warmed up for @entity33 by putting on a masterclass for @entity6 at the @entity69			1
@entity4 has been putting in extra work this week at the @entity206 training ground in @entity207 @entity4 has been at the training ground preparing hard for the trip to @entity23 's @entity69 on sunday @entity56 was n't the only one mesmerised			1
just look at the feedback : the kid from next door in @entity23 , with the ability to glue the ball to his foot , has been swaying a few votes in his favour , it seems			0
yet on sunday at 8pm , another chapter of @entity3 vs @entity4 – a rivalry that demands its own wikipedia page – will be written in front of an estimated global television audience of 500 million			2
@entity3 received plenty of feedback from the world of football and beyond for his performance against @entity6 @entity3 delivered a man of the match performance as he ran the @entity6 defence ragged at the @entity69 the table below shows how the attacking trios of @entity23 ( @entity3 , @entity235 and @entity83 ) and @entity20 ( @entity4 , @entity236 and @entity19 ) compare in all competitions			1
