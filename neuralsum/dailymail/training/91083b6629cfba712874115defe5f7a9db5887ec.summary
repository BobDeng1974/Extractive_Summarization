by @entity0 last updated at 8:38 pm on 26th october 2011 a married couple say they are facing financial ruin after they were landed with a £ 73,000 electricity bill in error - and were ordered to pay it			1
despite their electricity supplier admitting to the mistake , @entity8 and @entity9 have been told an astronomical underpayment must be met after they were undercharged for five years			1
the couple , who run a bar in @entity18 , were unknowingly undercharged by a @entity20 gas consumption meter for five years - an error to which the company has admitted			1
astronomical : @entity24 with the electricity bill which , he says , will ruin his business if they are forced to pay it however , the energy company has insisted the underpayment must be met - despite the fact it was its fault			1
@entity8 , who runs the @entity32 in the @entity34 area of @entity18 , @entity35 , said : ' it 's an amount we ca n't afford and it 's not our error			2
' the dad - of - three said they had been paying more than £ 4,000 a year broken up into quarters for the past five years			2
he added : ' they were reasonable amounts of money we were paying , we were n't hiding behind £ 15 bills and just not saying anything			0
we did n't realise there was an issue			0
' the 44 - year - old has been running the bar for the past 11 years and in 2006 the business expanded			1
the changes included the introduction of a new electricity meter			2
however in august the couple received a received the ultimate red letter from @entity56 saying the meter readings taken over the five - year period had n't been used to create their bills			1
error : the letter informing the @entity62 there had been a mistake ( left ) and the bill ( right ) for almost £ 73,000 the worried businessman said the bill for £ 72,788.04 had since been revised to £ 58,000 , but said this was still ' unachievable '			1
@entity8 said : ' it 's been terrible , stress , sleepless nights , it could put us out of business			2
eleven years of hard work could be shattered			2
' i have been with @entity56 11 years and to have this debt suddenly land on your doorstep is utterly amazing			1
' in its original letter to the @entity62 , @entity56 said : ' we 're sorry there was a mistake with some of your invoices			1
' as soon as we realised our mistake we put it right			2
the actual meter readings that have been provided were not used to create your bills			2
' i understand that this additional cost was unexpected so i want to make payment terms fair and as hassle - free as possible			0
so interest charges will , of course , be waived			0
' @entity8 said : ' apparently actual readings that have been phoned through by ourselves and taken by official meter reading personnel have been ignored by @entity56 ' central computer and have been continually estimated for the past five years			1
fears : the couple say they could end up losing the business they spent 11 years building up because of the error by @entity56 ' the data is imputed into the computer and it deems to estimate to be too high and produces a lower estimate , which we got			1
this happened every time over the past five years			0
' if the bills had been correct they would have been involved in our cashflow and we 'd have paid accordingly			0
' they offered us two choices , either to pay up in full of over three years , but to pay the money back over that time is unachievable			0
' they 've made a mistake over the last five years			1
i think it would be only courtesy to offer us the same amount of time to pay back the debt , or maybe more			0
' @entity9 has taken time off work , suffered sleepless nights , stress , anxiety made trips to the doctor			0
i think i am putting a braver face on at the moment			0
' @entity9 , 40 , who lives with her husband and three daughters , @entity137 - lily , seven , @entity133 , five and @entity134 , three , said : ' it is an extremely worrying situation to be in for a small business during the recession			0
' i 'm anxious all the time about how we are going to pay this huge bill			0
we are trying to get through the recession and to have to concentrate on something like this on top , it feels like the last straw			0
' @entity8 said he was contacted by the the customer service department of @entity56 who want to sent somebody round to inspect the meter and talk about the bill			1
a @entity56 spokeswoman said : ' i am very sorry to hear about mr @entity24 's situation			1
' we are investigating this case fully as a matter of urgency and we hope to come to a mutually acceptable arrangement with mr @entity24 following this investigation			0
