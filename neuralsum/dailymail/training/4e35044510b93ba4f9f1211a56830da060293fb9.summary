by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor senior labour mps rounded on @entity3 today - as election experts warned the party was no longer on track to win the next general election			1
while the party made significant progress in @entity11 it struggled elsewhere as anti-government protest votes went to @entity13			0
one of the country 's top polling experts professor @entity15 said @entity16 had lost up to nine per cent support since the last local elections two years ago			1
shadow chancellor @entity19 said the party 's performance was ' not good enough yet '			1
he added : ' we have got more to do if we are really going to win the argument			0
won @entity39 after taking seats from @entity41			0
retained control of @entity43 , despite losing three seats to @entity13			0
@entity45 : failing to win @entity46 is a setback , while losing control of @entity49 suggests the party may struggle to win key swing seats at the next election			1
in the party 's heartland of @entity55 , @entity13 took 10 of the 21 seats being contested			1
shadow chancellor @entity19 admitted @entity16 's performance had been poor			1
mr @entity19 said : ' it 's not good enough yet for @entity16			1
we have got more to do if we are really going to win the argument			0
' the @entity16 heavyweight said : ' we ’re doing better than people were expecting across southern seats but now the challenge is for @entity16 in the north - particularly where we ’re clearly the majority party or tight @entity67 / @entity16 areas			1
we have to understand that challenge			0
' he added that ' everyone is taken aback on gains across the country '			0
@entity16 mp @entity73 hit out at the @entity16 leadership for failing to take on @entity13			1
he said : ' the @entity75 and the people deciding strategy at the top , without question , and they told me this , had a strategy of ignoring @entity13 instead of taking them on			0
and that was a disastrous strategy			0
' what the party should have done in this election is take on @entity13			2
' but the @entity75 needs to have a broader appeal			0
people like me and the views that i represent			0
. our viewpoint is not sufficiently being heard within the @entity75			0
' the coalition of the @entity75 is not broad enough and we need to be part of it and if we 're not @entity16 wo n't win at the next general election			1
' he blasted ' pointy - heads ' at the top of the party for ignoring working class concerns			0
mr @entity73 accused mr @entity3 of not ' broadening the appeal ' of the party			2
@entity104 mp @entity103 admitted voters were being turned off by mr @entity3			1
he said : ' i ’m not going to pretend that @entity3 as an issue does n’t come up on the doorstep , of course it does			1
' @entity111 agreed that the public were not buying into the prospect of mr @entity3 being prime minister			2
mr @entity111 added : ' these was n’t the kind of enthusiasm on the doorstep that i have felt when we have been going to win elections			0
' and when you talk more deeply to people , they do n’t really find an empathy or sympathy with @entity125 he ’s not getting over his own personality over to them in a way they feel warm towards			0
' mr @entity111 was asked if he was worried by the results			0
he said : ' yes			0
' the @entity16 mp added : ' @entity3 has just said the general election campaign starts here			1
well , i am afraid , really , the general election campaign started at the start of this campaign , and we have not done as well as we should have done			2
' he attacked the @entity16 leadership 's refusal to grant the public a referendum on @entity143 and slammed mr @entity3 for his blundering tv performace this week in which he failed to know how much he spent on his shopping			1
' the centrepiece of our campaign has been the cost of living , and yet @entity3 did n’t know his own cost of living when he went into it , he did n’t know how much he was spending on shopping			1
' really , people around him should have said when @entity155 had been attacked as a posh boy not knowing the price of milk that we should not fall into that trap			0
we should know the price of milk and bread			0
that sort of thing is unforgivably unprofessional			1
' the @entity16 leader said the party was making gains in key battleground seats - including in @entity11 and the south @entity170			1
but he faced criticism from within his own party for not doing better professor @entity15 said the public did not seem to see @entity16 as a alternative government			2
he said : ' when it comes to local elections , we have quite high expectations of what oppositions should achieve			0
' we basically say , if a party looks as though it is potentially regarded as an alternative government , it should be doing very well in local elections , even better than you would expect to do in a general election in 12 months ' time			2
' the truth is , by that test at least , @entity16 have not done well enough			2
' most of the seats that were being up for grabs yesterday were last fought over on the same day as the 2010 general election			2
' and if you compare @entity16 's performance vote - for - vote with 2010 , the advance is just 3 percentage points - 3 per cent on what was the day in which @entity16 recorded its second worst result			1
' and if you actually compare these results with the position two years ago , which we can also compare most of these places with , @entity16 's vote is clearly well down , something like nine points			2
' when you talk more deeply to people , they do n’t really find an empathy or sympathy with @entity3 ' ' so the truth is , modest progress , @entity16 not even doing as well as they were able to do earlier in this parliament , and thereby again reinforcing the doubts that have always been there that at the end of the day it is not entirely clear that the @entity220 electorate regard @entity16 as a clear alternative			1
' former labour cabinet minister @entity222 yesterday warned the party was losing working class votes – and warned mr @entity3 to adopt a more ‘ robust ’ approach to @entity13			1
‘ the problem is that there is a seriously alienated – mostly white working class , often male – vote out there that was traditionally @entity16 ’s , ’ he said			2
one senior @entity16 figure told @entity231 : ‘ the truth is that @entity3 looks weird , sounds weird , is weird			1
’ @entity16 shadow business secretary @entity233 attempted to play down the emergence of @entity13 , saying support for the party represented ‘ discontent with the entire political system ’			1
but he added : ‘ undoubtedly we ’re in an era of four party politics			0
former minister @entity242 said the party should have done better in places such as @entity46 , conceding that voters were ' swallowing ' @entity13 's message on immigration and @entity143			2
but @entity16 election boss @entity248 insisted @entity16 could win the general election based on the results coming in overnight from key battleground seats			1
the party has seized control in @entity34 and @entity35 , previously a flagship @entity67 authority , and is expecting positive results in @entity256 and @entity36			0
' @entity3 is not on course to win the next election ' , claimed @entity259 after the results started trickling through this morning			2
many @entity261 are concerned that mr @entity3 is seen as too ' weird ' to win he told @entity262 ’s today programme : ' i think there is not just a whole group of people who feel left behind by the economy but locked out of politics			1
' there is a deep anger and alienation there and the votes that we have seen for @entity13 overnight are in part a reflection of that reality			0
' the challenge is how does a party like the @entity75 seek to respond ? and i do n’t think simply politics as usual is an adequate response to trends that did n’t build up in the last few days , but actually have been building up over decades			0

@entity285 : @entity16 have *1,812* seats , up *288* . hold *77* councils , up six
@entity3 ' looks weird , sounds weird , is weird ’ , says senior party figure
his campaign performance slammed as ' unforgivably unprofessional '
@entity296 's support down 9 *%* since 2012 , election experts reveal
' worried ' @entity261 admit voters turned off by their party leader
' i ’m not going to pretend @entity3 as an issue does n’t come up ' says mp
