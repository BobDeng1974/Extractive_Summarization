published : 04:53 est , 13 may 2013 updated : 10:41 est , 13 may 2013 according to callers , the 111 line is not picking up calls quickly enough the extent of the new @entity6 non-emergency advice line ’s teething problems have been laid bare after official figures revealed a stark rise in abandoned calls			2
the number of people who hung up after waiting for a response for more than 30 seconds increased from 6,976 in february to 29,100 in march , according to @entity15 figures			1
and the average call length also increased from 14.19 minutes in february to almost 18 minutes in march			2
however , while the number of abandoned calls rose , the number of calls to the line increased by more than half a million within the same timeframe too			1
last week , leading doctors warned that the ' problematic ' roll - out of the nhs 111 advice line had left patients not knowing where to turn to for help			2
the @entity28 said patients have ' lost confidence ' in the new non-emergency number before it is even fully up and running across the country			0
the service was planned to be rolled out on april 1 , but officials were forced to postpone the deadline after it emerged that many of the advice lines - which are run by 44 individual local bodies across the country - were not ready to ' go live '			0
and , more than a month on , seven of the regional bodies are still not ready to start giving advice to patients in their areas			0
patients have complained about calls going unanswered and poor advice being given , especially at weekends , which has led to hospitals being inundated with patients who could be treated elsewhere			1
today health minister @entity47 hit out at the quality of the some of the operators of the 111 line but claimed that across most of @entity15 people were getting a ' good ' or ' fantastic ' service			1
frustration : those calling the new @entity6 helpline say that they are being given substandard advice , especially at weekends at question time in the @entity59 , @entity60 said : ' we recognise that the @entity6 111 launches in march did not go as smoothly as planned and a number of providers have delivered an unacceptable service , especially at weekends			1
' @entity15 is working closely with clinical commissioning groups to stabilise providers who have failed to deliver an effective service and to ensure those areas yet to go live are in a safe and fit state to do so			0
' but shadow health minister @entity72 of @entity73 demanded : “ on what grounds was the decision made to go ahead with the national roll - out in the light of the results from the pilot which showed problems with the scheme and the fact that many people in the @entity6 advised ministers and @entity15 that it should not have been rolled out because it was not ready to be rolled out ? ' @entity60 said @entity85 had carried out research on the pilots which suggested high levels of satisfaction and that the service was sending people to the right places			1
' on that basis it was considered safe to go ahead with the roll - out			0
' unfortunately , in particular areas of the country the resources deployed to meet the demand have not been accurately assessed , ' he added			0
' across the vast bulk of @entity15 people are getting a good if not fantastic service			2
' unfortunately , in two particular areas of the country - the @entity108 and @entity109 - we are still seeing the problems arising			0

the number of abandoned phone calls rose from 6,976 in february to 29,100 in march
patients complaining that calls are going unanswered and poor advice is being given , especially at weekends
health minister @entity60 admitted that some *branches* had provided ' unacceptable ' service
but he said that the majority were providing ' good ' or ' fantastic ' *provision* of services to patients
