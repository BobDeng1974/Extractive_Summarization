by @entity1 reporter claims : @entity3 , 67 , is said to have died , but now there are reports she is in a vegetative state @entity8 's aunt is alive , but in a vegetative state after an operation on a brain tumour , according a report in @entity13 @entity3 , 67 , whose husband @entity14 was executed under @entity8 's orders less than a month ago , is reported to have had surgery last year in @entity17			1
the revelations conflict with reports earlier last week which claimed that she had died and may her killed herself			1
there has been speculation on her health and whereabouts since the death on 8 december of her husband , also 67 , described as ' scum ' by his 30 - year - old nephew			1
once a key figure in the totalitarian regime , mrs @entity33 , the sister of @entity8 's father , former leader @entity34 , has not been seen in public since 10 september , when she was spotted at a concert with her nephew and his wife			2
a report in the @entity40 quoted an intelligence official in the @entity42 that ms @entity33 has been in a vegetative state since she underwent brain surgery in @entity46 , reported @entity47			0
an official in the @entity13 government told @entity50 that mrs @entity33 is in ' a critical condition ' as a result of complications stemming from a heart problem			0
one story suggested mrs @entity33 had been receiving treatment for heart disease , reportedly had a heart attack soon after her husband was killed			0
mrs @entity33 , front , seen in 2011 with her nephew @entity8 , front right , and husband @entity14 , two behind @entity8 despite her husband having been executed , mrs @entity33 's life was believed to be safe , particularly when she was chosen to join other dignitaries planning the funeral of a senior @entity68 official who died last month			1
she is said to have suffered from alcoholism and depression since the death of her only child , daughter @entity14 , who killed herself in @entity17 in 2006			1
initial speculation was that @entity14 had been killed by firing squad , a fate that media outlets said was the usual one reserved for ' traitors '			1
condemned : @entity14 ( second right ) is escorted in court before being executed			2
@entity79 has not released details about how he was killed @entity83 's aunt : @entity3 , centre front , is the younger sister of @entity8 's father , @entity34 however , an alternative narrative of the 67 - year old 's death emerged on what appears to have been a satirical post on the @entity93 @entity92 site that has been repeated by many media outlets worldwide			1
the december 11 post on @entity92 , which was viewed 290,000 times , said @entity14 and five aides were killed by dogs			2
the @entity101 - based @entity100 newspaper then released an article and a screenshot of the @entity92 post which it used to justify its report that @entity14 had been torn apart			0
@entity100 , although independent , is viewed as being pro-beijing			0
its report was in turn picked up 12 days later by the @entity109 - based @entity108 and then by a wide range of @entity42 and @entity112 media from print to television			0
@entity8 , believed to be around 30 years old , has been in power for two years and presided over a nuclear test and two rocket test launches that are banned under @entity119 sanctions			2
in 2013 , @entity120 threatened to strike @entity13 , the @entity42 and @entity121 in fiery rhetoric that triggered an arms buildup in @entity124			0
one of the pitfalls of reporting on @entity79 is that few independent media have offices there and visiting media are tightly controlled in a country which ranks among the lowest in global surveys of press freedom			0
because of the lack of first hand information , many lurid stories about the country gain credence			0
family power : @entity3 in 1963 with her father , then @entity79 leader @entity140 , and brother , @entity34 , left			1

@entity3 , 67 , is aunt of @entity79 *dictator* @entity8 , 30
her husband @entity14 was executed by @entity8 last month
earlier reports claimed she was dead and may have killed herself
