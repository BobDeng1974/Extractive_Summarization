@entity1 ' decision to rest @entity2 failed to pay dividends as even the @entity6 captain 's emergence off the bench failed to inspire his side to break down a resolute @entity9			1
@entity11 's @entity10 rated the players ' performances at @entity14			2
@entity6 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity15 - 6.5 a clean sheet against his old club			2
was n't subjected to the kind of pressure that might have exposed his brittle confidence			2
@entity22 - 7 lost possession at one point in the first half but , other than that , he was solid throughout and did all that was all that was asked of him			0
@entity30 - 6.5 not given a moment to relax by @entity32			0
a couple of rash challenges before the break but , otherwise , steady in the man			2
@entity37 was a bright spot in a disappointing display by @entity6 @entity40 - 7 has n't given @entity41 any suggestion he will relinquish his place any time soon			1
the pick of @entity6 's defence , even if he looked to be carrying a groin problem			0
@entity47 - 6 likes to make his presence felt in the opposite half of the field , as one surge in the second half proved , but can be careless when doing the job he is paid to			2
@entity56 - 7 neat and tidy , protected the defence with his usual reliability			0
had one shot in the second half that @entity61 comfortably saved			0
@entity62 - 6 @entity64 hard work and covered plenty of miles but some of his passing in the second half lacked zip and he did n't get involved as much as he would have liked			0
@entity71 - 5.5 a skilful player , for sure , but this was not a game for him to remember			1
@entity75 tended to pass him by and he eventually made way for @entity2			0
@entity6 defender @entity22 put in a solid performance on saturday @entity78 - 5.5 had two shots on target , either side of the break , and some of his trickery was impressive			1
but , again , he flattered to deceive and failed to see the game out			0
@entity37 - 7.5 the man most likely to find a breakthrough for long with his speed on the breaking and dancing feet			1
gradually getting back to the standards he set himself			2
@entity95 - 6 not quite at the level he had shown in previous games			0
no faulting his commitment and had a first half header saved but no other chances followed			0
subs @entity2 ( for @entity102 ) 7 ; @entity108 ( for @entity107 ) @entity104 ( @entity105 ) , @entity106 , @entity41 , can , @entity103 @entity2 came on as late sub but he was unable to help @entity6 grab a winner @entity9 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) @entity61 - 7 did everything that was asked of him ; handled the ball with confidence and saved everything that was thrown his way			1
@entity120 - 6.5 had the trouble of trying to contain @entity37 ; got booked for one foul but otherwise solid and played his part in getting a point			1
@entity125 - 7.5 led by example and cruised through the game , won his headers and kept the back four organised			1
@entity130 - 7 one anxious moment late on when he tangled with @entity37 but , in the main , he was never over-exerted trying to keep @entity95 at arms ' length			1
@entity134 - 7 did all that was asked of him , providing bite on the left hand side of @entity9 's defence			1
even when @entity37 switched flanks he remained composed			1
@entity141 - 8 his outstanding afternoon was summed up when he flung himself in front of a shot from @entity62 ; ran himself to a standstill to protect his defence			1
@entity9 striker @entity146 put himself about and went close to breaking the deadlock @entity148 - 5.5 on the periphery , did n't provide any guile when it mattered			1
no surprise when his afternoon was brought to a premature end			0
@entity154 - 6 performed a diligent role but was n't always accurate with the range of his passing and his normally accurate set pieces lacked precision			0
@entity161 - 6.5 worked hard and there were no frills but he had the first shot of the game that flashed wide and contributed to what was a stoic @entity9 performance			1
@entity146 - 6.5 always involved , had a couple of shouts for penalty in the first half and then thrashed a volley wide after the break			0
it was the best chance of the game			0
@entity32 - 5.5 a physical presence who tried to bulldoze his way past @entity30 and @entity40 but never threatened to find a way past @entity15 and was eventually withdrawn			2
subs @entity180 ( for @entity32 70mins 5 ) , @entity181 ( for @entity22 79mins ) , @entity182 ( for @entity154 70mins 5 ) unused @entity183 ( gk ) , @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186			0

@entity71 and @entity78 ( 5.5 ) *struggled* to make an impact
@entity37 ( 7.5 ) showed he was getting back to his best
@entity9 *midfielder* @entity141 ( 8 ) was man of the match
