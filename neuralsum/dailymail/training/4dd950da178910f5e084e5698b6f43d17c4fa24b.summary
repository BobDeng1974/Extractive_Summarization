by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 14:56 est , 30 october 2013 updated : 10:16 est , 31 october 2013 president @entity2 said wednesday that he has ' complete confidence ' in @entity5 secretary @entity4 , just hours after she took a beating during a congressional hearing over the disastrous @entity9 website			1
his defense of @entity4 came after she was forced to concede on @entity11 that @entity2 , not she , was ultimately responsible for the @entity9 's rocky launch			1
' the president has complete confidence in @entity16 , ' @entity14 deputy press secretary @entity13 told reporters aboard @entity18 en route to the president 's speech in @entity21 , where he offered full - throated oratory on the importance of his signature health insurance overhaul			1
@entity13 focused on @entity4 ' early apology rather than on her later concession that the buck stops in the @entity28			0
she ' took responsibility for many of the problems that are evident with the website , but she also deserves credit for the other aspects of the @entity9 implementation that have gone well , ' he said			2
' but later during her testimony wednesday before the @entity54 , @entity4 was muscled into sharing blame for the glitch - prone rollout with her boss in the @entity14			1
@entity60 @entity59 rep. @entity59 pressed her on who is ultimately to blame for a website that was n't adequately tested before its october 1 launch , and crashed wednesday morning , rendering it out of service during most of @entity4 ' 3 - 1/2 hour grilling			2
' the president ultimately is responsible , ' @entity59 insisted			0
' while i think it ’s great that you ’re a team player and you ’re taking responsibility , it is the president ’s ultimate responsibility , correct ? ' ' uh , whatever , ' she sniped while shaking her head			0
' yes , he is the president			0
he is responsible for government programs			0
' less than five hours later , @entity2 proudly drew parallels between his @entity9 program and former gov. @entity78 's , begun seven years ago in @entity21			1
' there were early problems to solve , ' when @entity78 reformed health insurance programs there , he said , just as his program 's rollout has been plagued with poor management , technical failures and organizational snafus			0
' there were changes that had to be made			0
' and of his own program , he admitted , ' the web site is too slow , too many people have gotten stuck and i 'm not happy about it			1
' @entity2 recalled happily how 36,000 @entity97 citizens signed up for @entity78 care in the first year , a pace that would leave @entity9 short by millions of taxpayers adoring throng : a crowd estimated at 800 clapped and cheered for @entity2 as he reinforced his vision of a government - managed health insurance market @entity106 : protesters yelled in unison about the @entity109 as @entity2 quipped that they were at the wrong rally ' enrollment was extremely slow , ' @entity2 recalled of @entity78 's experiment in government management of the insurance market			1
' within a month only about a hundred people had signed up			0
... by the end of the year , 36,000 people had signed up			1
' @entity97 comprises 2.1 per cent of the @entity1 population ; at the same rate , the @entity9 program would only have 1.7 million new insurance enrollees by october 1 , 2014			1
administration officials have said they need 7 million to sign up – more than four times as many – in order for the @entity9 's books to balance as its strains to cover health care costs of the elderly and chronically ill. still , @entity2 claimed of @entity97 , ' the vast majority of its citizens are happy with their coverage			1
' ' i 'm confident this plan will work because the @entity97 model has shown that it works , ' he said repeatedly to wild applause from an estimated 800 partisans			2
@entity2 was interrupted twice by screaming protesters upset about the construction of the @entity109			1
' that is the wrong rally , ' he quipped , saying ' we had the climate change rally back in the summer			0
' campaigner - in - chief : @entity2 kissed babies and even signed an ' i ( heart ) @entity9 ' cast as he greeted his supporters friendly faces : @entity2 is mobbed by supporters after his speech in which he said reforming healthcare was a ' no - brainer ' responding to complaints that insurers are dropping millions of @entity1 from their coverage , he declared that those policies were ' cut - rate plans ' sold by ' bad apple insurers ' who were n't offering benefits in line with what the @entity9 law requires			1
his @entity167 opponents have highlighted dozens of examples of constituents receiving cancellation letters , many of which cite the @entity9 as the reason policies are being discontinued			2
one member of @entity176 brought his own such letter to a hearing on wednesday			2
but ' @entity1 would be better off , ' @entity2 jabbed , if @entity167 put as much energy into helping the @entity9 succeed nationally as they put into criticizing it			1
@entity181 is a statewide plan , instituted by @entity2 's one - time @entity167 election foe @entity78 when he was governor of @entity97 , that formed part of the template the president used when his team formulated the @entity9			1
the hearing was rife with stories about taxpayers who have lost their medical coverage because of new requirements forced on insurance companies by the @entity9 law , and included a contentious exchange in which @entity4 said she would n't – or could n't – buy health insurance through the government 's insurance exchanges herself			2
' why are n't you losing your insurance ? ” @entity203 @entity202 rep. @entity202 demanded			0
' why wo n’t you go into this exchange ? ' @entity5 secretary @entity4 apologized to a congressional committee for wasting @entity1 ' time as they tried and failed to use the crippled @entity9 website the most hated woman in @entity1 ? @entity4 is staying put , said @entity2 's aide , despite the woeful performance of the program she 's leading ' i think it ’s illegal for me , ' she replied , citing the employer - sponsored insurance she already enjoys as a federal government employee			1
she later said she would ' gladly join the exchange ' if she were n't already covered			0
' you can decide to drop the coverage from your employer , ' @entity218 insisted			0
' you have the choice to decide not to choose [ it ]			0
' @entity224 – when it 's up and running – advises people in @entity4 ' position , however , that ' f you ’d like to explore marketplace coverage options you can			2
' she would , however , be required to forgo taxpayers ' contribution toward her coverage			0
as a 65 - year - old who is enrolled in @entity234 , @entity4 could also reject that coverage if she chose to , relying solely on exchange - driven insurance as millions of @entity1 are contemplating as they find policy cancellation notices in their mailboxes			1
that , though , would be a symbolic and impractical choice			0
@entity2 will follow his health insurance speech with an appearance at a @entity243 fundraiser on wednesday night , but will return to @entity244 without seeing the sixth game of the @entity246 between the @entity247 and the @entity248			2
the president , @entity13 reminded reporters , is a @entity251 fan			0
' i am well aware that a presidential visit is not the biggest thing going on today in @entity21 , ' the president said during his speech			2
' i promise we will be done here in time for everybody here to head over to @entity260			0

' the president has complete confidence in @entity16 , ' said a @entity14 *spokesman*
the @entity5 chief has faced *brutal* questions from @entity176 , including demands for @entity9 *waivers* and her *resignation*
@entity2 praised @entity181 for enrolling 36,000 in @entity97 in 1 year , a pace that would leave @entity9 more than 5 million short
' the web site is too slow , too many people have gotten stuck and i 'm not happy about it , ' he admitted
@entity2 blamed ' cut - rate plans ' sold by ' bad apple insurers ' for reports that millions are now losing coverage because of the @entity9
*global* *warming* activists interrupted the speech twice , *heckling* the president about the @entity109 pipeline
