@entity0 earns her living off her acid tongue - hundreds of thousands of hapless @entity3 have been hung out to dry for their choice in children 's names of size of waistband since she shot to fame on @entity10			1
but for the first time ever , the social commentator was unusually caring and compassionate as she appeared on this morning alongside @entity13 - the 25 - stone mother who has called on the government to pay her to lose weight			1
the pair sat arm - in - arm on the @entity21 programme 's sofa with presenters @entity22 and @entity24 , with @entity0 even proclaiming @entity26 war on people who have attacked @entity13 on the internet since her comments were first published			1
@entity0 ( right ) showed a sympathetic side for the first time when she appeared on this morning today with 25 - stone @entity13 , who wants help from the government to lose weight @entity0 admitted that her new weight gain - almost four stone in three months - has made her much more sympathetic to large people			1
she said : ' i understand , i only put on half my body weight , but i understand about this thing of getting to the front door and people calling you names			2
' it has n't changed my view , i stand by everything i said - i still would n't employ a fat person			2
' looking at myself after a few months ( putting on weight ) , i would n't employ me either as it 's hard on your knees , on your health , even hard to breathe			0
mother - of - two @entity13 complained that junk food is much cheaper than healthy food ' but i also see the abuse and aggression directed on @entity26 for ( @entity13 ) , i also see someone with this body mass where it must be hard to deal with all of that weight			1
' i can see that i learned some big things when i put on weight , that it 's hard			0
' @entity13 , 26 , from @entity63 hit the headlines this week after she complained that she needed more taxpayers ' money than her Â£ 15,000 - a - year benefits in order to overhaul her unhealthy lifestyle			1
the mother - of - two believes that she ca n't lose weight because she can only afford junk food and does n't have the funds to pay for a gym			2
speaking on this morning for the first time since she prompted a nationwide backlash for her comments in this week 's @entity78 , @entity13 said she could understand why people were so annoyed with her demands			1
she said : ' i understand the outrage , i do get benefits paid for me but i have a daughter with @entity84 and i help a lot as a carer for my brother as well			0
' the only thing i can control is what i eat because comfort food is better than going out and letting people bully me			2
' @entity0 sat arm - in - arm with @entity13 throughout the @entity94 interview with @entity22 and @entity24 ( left ) ' i go to the door and get ready for a run , but then i just turn back and go inside - i think that if i go for a run down the street , people will laugh at me			1
' i do n't want ( weight - loss ) surgery , i want to prove to my kids that i can do it myself , the price of gym should be lowered			0
' whereas in the past , @entity0 would have argued against these comments , the mother - of - three was surprisingly understanding of @entity13 's reluctance to exercise			1
the new issue of closer with @entity13 's interview is out now she said : ' i used to say , for goodness sake , put trainers on and go for a run			2
' but there is a large population of obese people who are invisible because they do n't want to go out			0
' sometimes you get to a point where you go to a doctor and they say your @entity123 is too high for help			0
' fat clubs , i call them that , but they would call themselves @entity127 or @entity128 , would also be less inclined to help because you 're too large and it is too expensive to join those anyway			0
' so the people who are joining me in my project to lose weight , we 're trying to set up a way on @entity26 of finding a way that works for us			0
' so for example , ( @entity13 ) really loves swimming , so if she could find someone to buddy with then she 'd feel safer because there are people there in case someone calls you names			2
' weight is much more of a mental issue than in your body			0
' the tv star also had a parting shot for all of the keyboard warriors who have been targeting @entity13 with hurtful comments over the web in the past 24 hours			1
she said : ' if you go on her , you take me on too			0
