but it was the rain , rather than the weapons , that meant a re-enactment of the @entity16 was cancelled yesterday			1
some 1,066 people dressed as @entity19 and @entity20 warriors were expected to stage their own version of the famous battle at what is thought to be the original site in @entity25			2
but history fans were left disappointed after heavy downpours on saturday meant organiser @entity28 was forced to cancel the event for ‘ safety reasons ’			1

every year history enthusiasts recreate the @entity16 , a huge turning point in @entity36 history fog of war : one thousand and sixty six @entity39 and @entity19 soldiers from re-enactment groups across @entity41 aimed to faithfully recreate the @entity16 in 1066 a spokesman for @entity28 said : ‘ although the forecast was for fair weather over this weekend , unexpected torrential rain over several hours this morning has resulted in unacceptably high levels of mud both on the battlefield and on public areas			1
for safety reasons , the event can not go ahead			2
’ @entity52 , of @entity53 , said : ‘ it is understandable but it is a real shame because the organisers put a lot of time and money into organising and advertising it			0
’ the council had held a week - long festival of events , culminating in the re-enactment weekend , since the battle ’s 900th anniversary in 1966			2
while the battle was cancelled , events on saturday including a town criers ’ contest and firework display , went ahead			1

@entity77 was killed in the battle , the last @entity80 king to die in battle on @entity80 soil until @entity83 was killed at the @entity84 battle fatigue : members of historical re-enactment groups prepare to assume the role of @entity19 soldiers for the annual re-enactment of the @entity16 at @entity91 there you go , dear : a woman hands a warrior his sword			2
@entity16 was the last successful invasion of @entity36 the @entity16 took place on october 14 1066 between the @entity19 - @entity99 army of @entity100 of @entity101 and the @entity80 army under @entity77 @entity77 was killed - legend has it that he was shot in the eye with an arrow - and was the last @entity80 king to die in battle on @entity80 soil until @entity83 was killed at the @entity84			0
the battle was a decisive victory for @entity100 , who became @entity80 's first @entity19 ruler			0
echoes of history : re-enactors strive to be as historically accurate as possible , even down to the food they eat cosy : a soldier takes a break			0
even accommodation is as authentic as possible stoic : like their real - life counterparts , the re-enactors have to lug their heavy weapons and armour around the battlefield the battle is depicted in the @entity125 , which also chronicled the events leading up to the @entity127 of @entity80			1
an abbey was built on the site of the battle after pope @entity131 ordered the @entity19 to do penance for killing so many people during their occupation			0
