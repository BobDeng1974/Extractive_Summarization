a whisleblowing paramedic who spoke out about the chaos his local @entity3 departments has been banned from both hospitals			1
@entity5 , of @entity6 , was reprimanded after saying under - pressure emergency units were ' not safe '			1
he has since been told he is not welcome at hospitals in @entity9 and @entity10			2
the comments were made by the paramedic of 26 years during an interview with the @entity14			1
during it , he described how even before the winter pressures , patients were routinely treated in corridors at the @entity19			1
banned : @entity5 , of @entity6 , was reprimanded after saying under - pressure emergency units were ' not safe ' in fact , the practice was so commonplace that ' there were labels along the corridor of the emergency department so staff could find the patients '			1
' last friday , there were 18 trolleys with sick patients , ' he said			2
' there were @entity32 being done , stitches , cannulas ( a medical tube inserted into the body with a needle ) - staff were doing everything in the corridor			0
' i 've never seen anything like it - and i do not believe it 's safe			0
it 's not good for the patients and their care is being jeapordised			0
' since then , however , mr @entity5 claims he was told he was ' not welcome ' at either the @entity9 hospital or the @entity48			1
the trust told the @entity14 it is under extreme pressure - and patients are being treated on trolleys to prevent them from being treated in ambulances			1
it added the ban had been imposed as mr @entity5 's comments had upset staff			2
in a statement , @entity60 , chief operating officer at @entity61 , said : ' we would like to make clear that our conversations with mr @entity5 and his representatives about his presence at our hospital are related to personal upset he has caused among some of our @entity3 staff in relation to the interpretation of some of his comments			1
' whistleblowing is positively encouraged and promoted within our organisation and we take any concerns about our quality of care very seriously from anyone who wishes to raise them			0
' our @entity3 staff are proud to have a very positive working relationship with the paramedics who visit our sites ... it is critical to preserve relationships with the ambulance service – especially at this crucial time - in order to ensure the safety of patients in our care			0
he added : ' in response to this isolated incident , we have suggested it would be appropriate for mr @entity5 to address the upset he has caused among @entity3 staff who are working tirelessly under what has been – and continues to be - extreme pressure			2
' we hope that mr @entity5 and his @entity101 colleagues will work with us on this to reach an amicable outcome			0
' but a spokesman for @entity105 told @entity106 that mr @entity5 was working and being deployed as normal			1
frantic : during the tv interview , he described how even before the winter pressures , patients were routinely treated in corridors at the @entity19 ( pictured ) ' this is an issue between the union and the hospital , ' he said			1
a spokesman for the hospital trust admitted he was ' not fully aware ' of what had been decided			0
@entity117 , @entity101 's @entity118 , said rather than dealing with the problems facing @entity3 departments the @entity61 had chosen to personally attack one of their members			0
' our rep mr @entity5 is clearly acting in the public interest in whistle blowing about serious concerns about @entity3			0
the response from the @entity61 's chief operating officer , mr @entity60 is nothing short of an utter disgrace , ' he said			0
' by banning mr @entity5 from the trust premises mr @entity60 is putting patients ' lives at risk			2
' what happens if mr @entity5 is on a 999 call in the area and the best place to take patient is to @entity141			0
' is the chief operating officer saying that mr @entity5 will be turned away , and will have to take the patient to a hospital further away , thus endangering patient safety ? ' the public knows that front - line @entity148 workers are working flat out to deal excess workload in @entity3			2

@entity5 , @entity6 , gave interview to @entity14
a paramedic for 26 years , said he *'d* ' never seen hospital situations like it '
described how 18 patients were treated in corridors on one day
since speaking out , has been told he is no longer welcome at the hospitals
