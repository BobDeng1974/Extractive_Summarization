doctors now have convincing evidence that they put @entity2 into remission , hopefully for good , in a @entity5 baby born with the @entity7 virus — a medical first that is prompting a new look at how hard and fast such cases should be treated			1
the case was reported earlier this year but some doctors were skeptical that the baby was really infected rather than testing positive because of exposure to virus in the mom 's blood			1
the new report , published online wednesday by the @entity19 , makes clear that the girl , now 3 , was infected in the womb			1
she was treated unusually aggressively and shows no active infection despite stopping @entity7 medicines 18 months ago			1
a cure ? dr. @entity25 specializes in juvenile @entity2 and helped research the case doctors wo n't call it a cure because they do n't know what proof or how much time is needed to declare someone free of hiv infection , long feared to be permanent			1
' we want to be very cautious here			0
we 're calling it remission because we 'd like to observe the child for a longer time and be absolutely sure there 's no rebound , ' said dr. @entity42 , a @entity43 expert involved in the baby 's care			2
the government 's top @entity7 scientist , dr. @entity46 , director of the @entity47 , agreed			1
' at minimum , the baby is in a clear remission			2
it is possible that the baby has actually been cured			2
we do n't have a definition for cure as we do for certain cancers , where after five years or so you can be relatively certain the person is not going to go and relapse , ' he said			0
a scientist at his institute did sophisticated tests that showed no active virus in the child			2
a government - sponsored international study starting in january aims to test early treatment in babies born with @entity2 to see if the results in this case can be reproduced			0
normally the virus ( pictured as seen under a microscope ) rebounds if treatment stops most hiv - infected moms in the @entity77 get @entity7 medicines during pregnancy , which greatly cuts the chances they will pass the virus to their babies			1
but the @entity5 mom got no prenatal care and her @entity2 was discovered during labor			0
doctors considered the baby to be at such high risk that they started the child on three powerful medicines 30 hours after birth , rather than waiting for a test to confirm infection as is usually done			1
within a month , the baby 's virus fell to undetectable levels			0
she remained on treatment until she was 18 months old when doctors lost contact with her			1
ten months later when she returned , they could find no sign of infection even though the mom had stopped giving the child @entity7 medicines			1
only one other person is thought to have been cured of hiv infection — a @entity108 man who had a bone marrow transplant in 2007 from a donor with natural resistance to @entity2 , and showed no sign of infection five years later			2
in the @entity5 baby , ' there 's no immune mechanism we can identify that would keep the virus in check ' like that bone marrow donor , said another study author , dr. @entity25 of the @entity122 , who helped investigate the case because she has researched treatment in children			0
a ' functional cure ' for @entity7 can be achieved for some patients diagnosed early , according to new research			2
image shows a conceptual view of @entity2 in the bloodstream dr. @entity132 , pediatric @entity2 chief at @entity133 of @entity134 and a government adviser on @entity2 treatment guidelines , said the child may have an undiscovered genetic trait that helped her manage the virus			0
' i 'm just not convinced that her dramatic response would be replicable in a large population , ' he said			0
it 's too soon to recommend treating other high - risk babies so aggressively without more study , he said			0
in the upcoming study , doctors plan to give @entity7 medicines for at least two years and watch for signs of remission before suspending treatment and seeing whether a remission results			1
the @entity5 case ' did open people 's eyes further ' about a possible cure , @entity42 said			0
' we might be able to intervene early and spare children a lifetime of therapy			0
that is the potential impact of this case			0

after the baby was cured , doctors *wondered* whether she ever actually had the *disease*
researchers were able to prove that the baby actually was infected while still in the womb
she was treated unusually aggressively and shows no active infection despite stopping @entity7 medicines 18 months ago
