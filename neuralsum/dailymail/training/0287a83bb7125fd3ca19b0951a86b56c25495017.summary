by @entity0 , @entity1 on sunday political reporter published : 16:36 est , 26 october 2013 updated : 18:43 est , 26 october 2013 challenge : his remarks came as @entity6 effectively admitted the fate of the entire @entity9 rail project now lay in @entity11 's hands the controversial @entity13 rail link took a fresh blow last night after @entity11 compared it with the @entity15			1
shadow chancellor @entity16 made clear that @entity11 , if elected , would not repeat the ‘ mistake ’ of the @entity15 and waste public money on unnecessary schemes inherited from a previous @entity20 government			1
in a @entity23 interview about the high - speed rail project , mr @entity16 was challenged over @entity11 ’s record in adopting the @entity26 - inspired @entity15 – now the @entity27 – in @entity28 , and building it despite the costs soaring to £ 750million			1
mr @entity16 replied : ‘ the @entity15 was a @entity26 vanity project which the @entity11 government should have scrapped in 1997 and did n’t			1
‘ it was a mistake and i think you should learn from your mistakes			2
’ his remarks came as @entity6 effectively admitted the fate of the entire @entity9 rail project now lay in @entity11 ’s hands , saying it could not go ahead without cross-party support			1
mr @entity16 ’ intervention comes ahead of a crucial week for the ambitious scheme , with ministers due to publish a comprehensive ‘ business case ’ showing @entity13 ’s expected benefits			0
there is also a vital commons vote on the @entity46 paving the way for @entity13 , with more than 30 @entity48 expected to rebel against the idea – despite it being seen as a flagship ‘ infrastructure ’ plan by the @entity53			0
@entity11 , which originally proposed the idea of a @entity9 high - speed link , has already made it clear there is no ‘ blank cheque ’ for the scheme , which would take 225mph trains from @entity28 to @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64			1
but in the @entity66 interview , the @entity16 raised fresh hurdles for the plans			0
he appeared to signal that even if the costs did not escalate beyond the current estimated £ 50billion bill , there was no guarantee an incoming @entity11 government would persist with it			0
‘ there are two sides to this ledger , ’ he said			0
‘ there is the cost and the benefit			0
and we need to know – are the costs under control ? secondly , are the benefits really there so that this would be the best way to spend that money			0
’ he also accused chancellor @entity87 of appearing like a ‘ cheerleader ’ for the scheme regardless of the costs and benefits			0
mistake : the @entity15 was a scheme inherited by @entity11 from a previous @entity20 government but its cost soared to £ 750million and was largely seen as a vanity project last week , mr @entity6 challenged @entity11 to come clean on its real intentions for @entity13 , saying massive projects such as this – which would take 20 years to complete – ‘ ca n’t go ahead without all - party support ’			1
the prime minister said that if @entity11 abandoned the plan , ‘ they will be letting down the @entity104 , they will be letting down the @entity9 ’			2
the @entity1 has learnt that mr @entity6 ’s intervention came after a private meeting with @entity107 , the @entity108 @entity20 mp who is spearheading this week ’s rebellion against the project			1
mr @entity107 said he told the prime minister that , as with the vote on military action against @entity115 last month , @entity11 would leave him in the lurch and come out against @entity13			2
@entity11 sources last night insisted that the party ‘ supports @entity13 in principle ’ and was a ‘ critical friend ’ to the project			2
but @entity11 has been challenged to explain why its mps are not being ordered to be at @entity124 on thursday to support the @entity125			2
they are on a ‘ one - line whip ’ , which means they have to vote for the rail plan only if they are at the @entity131 on the day .			0

balls called the @entity15 a @entity20 ' vanity project ' which @entity11 should have scrapped in 1997
branding it ' a mistake ' he told the @entity23 ' and i think you should learn from your mistakes '
his remarks came as @entity6 admitted fate of the @entity9 rail project is now in @entity11 ’s hands and could only go ahead with cross-party support
