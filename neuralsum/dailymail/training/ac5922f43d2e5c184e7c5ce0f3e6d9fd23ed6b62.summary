security will be unparalleled for the trial of @entity1 , a female member of an extreme right - wing terror cell which killed nine immigrant businessmen and a policewoman over a 13 year period			1
the 38 - year - old miss @entity1 has been dubbed the ‘ @entity20 ’ by the @entity8 press			1
charged with participation in all 10 executions , 15 robberies , setting up a terrorist organisation and numerous arsons , @entity1 could expect , under normal @entity8 law , to be out after 15 years if convicted			1
but prosecutors are seeking to implement the special clause in the national law called “ particularly grievous guilt ” which allows the state to incarcerate particularly heinous criminals forever			0
sewers have been sealed to prevent bombs being placed near the court , snipers will be on rooftops and police leave throughout @entity39 has been cancelled			1
@entity1 , idolised by @entity41 mass - killer @entity40 who wrote to her advising her to use her trial to spread “ right - wing propaganda , ” is branded by @entity8 ’s federal prosecutor @entity43 as being at the heart of planning and carrying out the murders			1
but the trial is about so much more than her - it is about the deep national sense of shame in police failings to stop her and her group , which was composed of @entity1 and two male sidekicks who were also her lovers			1
@entity8 police and intelligence agencies are braced for an outpouring of public scorn as their collective failings are set to be exposed			2
no link was ever made between the @entity54 and the killings , despite a vast covert intelligence network			0

the group was supported by a loose network of crazed neo-nazis who dreamed of a @entity96			0
during the killings no claim of responsibility was ever made ; the assassins hoped that the randomness of the murders would strike fear into @entity8 ’s immigrant population who would begin leaving en - masse			2
they went underground in 1998 and lived from the proceeds of bank robberies across the country			0
the cell imploded on november 4 2011 when her male accomplices @entity111 and @entity114 botched a bank raid			0
in a pre-arranged plan to avoid capture , @entity111 shot his accomplice before turning the gun on himself			0
@entity1 , as instructed , blew up their hideout in the east @entity8 city of @entity123			1
but the blast and subsequent fire failed to destroy a mountain of evidence , including videotapes in which the trio boasted of their crimes			0
days later , as a massive manhunt stretched across the country , she turned herself in .			0
