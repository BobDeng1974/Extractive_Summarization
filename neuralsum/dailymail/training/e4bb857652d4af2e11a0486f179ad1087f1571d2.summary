on trial : immigration officer @entity8 ( left ) and her partner @entity13 ( right ) are accused of faking a visa application in an attempt to bring a @entity5 nanny to @entity6 to work as ' cheap labour ' in reality , they had only employed the woman for six months , @entity21 was told			1
@entity8 and @entity25 , who had also worked as an immigration officer but later took up a management position with the @entity28 in @entity29 , both deny a count of assisting unlawful immigration			1

prosecutor @entity39 told the jury : ' the motive is one of greed			0
had they succeeded , had @entity10 come to the @entity6 for a period of a year , she would have worked for what can only be described as a pittance			2
' @entity8 and @entity25 are alleged to have hatched the plan in may 2011 at a secure compound where government staff were posted			1
miss @entity39 said : ' their role in this offence is all the more culpable and serious because of what they do , for @entity8 and @entity13 have both considered and approved and refused the applications made by others			2
' they have , in effect , stood in judgement over others for the very same offence they have now committed			0
' outlining the allegation , @entity63 said : ' sometime in the spring of 2011 @entity8 and @entity13 decided to return to the @entity6			1
' @entity8 had obtained a transfer back to the @entity6			2
she was due to take up a post in the @entity9 ’s @entity67 , based in @entity68			0
' she planned to take her young son with her			0
no doubt on her mind was childcare , and specifically the cost of childcare in @entity36 was something that she and @entity13 had to consider			0
' the prosecutor added : ' they hit upon a plan that their @entity5 nanny and maid @entity10 would be the ideal candidate to continue to look after their son when @entity8 worked in @entity36			1
' @entity8 was then said to have filled out a visa application form on their maid ’s behalf			0
@entity25 allegedly submitted the form on may 25 last year , together with a copy of the maid ’s contract claiming she had been working for the couple since may 10 , 2010			1
however , @entity63 told jurors that ms @entity10 had only been working for the couple since november 2010 - six months less than they had written on her visa application			2
she added : ' in submitting that form , as they did , @entity8 and @entity13 were breaking the law			2
' having been granted the visa , @entity25 was said to have asked for it to be reissued as it had only been granted for 11 months as opposed to the full year requested , jurors were told			2
this attracted the attention of issuing officer @entity102 , who knew the couple and recalled visiting their flat in the autumn of 2010 before a night out			0
on that visit , mrs @entity102 had found @entity8 annoyed that their maid was late , it is claimed			0
mrs @entity102 is then said to have heard that the couple had sacked the unreliable maid shortly afterwards and found a replacement called @entity10 - months later than claimed on the application form			0

@entity8 , who had since returned to the @entity6 , was arrested on june 8 last year			2
she had allegedly emailed a @entity9 colleague , saying : ' it ’s not looking good , i ’ll speak to you later			0
' @entity8 denied the allegation , as did her partner when he returned to the @entity6 for an interview later that month			1
@entity25 even claimed that @entity142 ‘ did not like him because he went out drinking with her husband , ’ the court heard			0
