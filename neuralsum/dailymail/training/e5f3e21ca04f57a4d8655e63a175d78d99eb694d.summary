by @entity0 follow @ @ samcunningham @entity1 could be about to join the list of top class players @entity4 has allowed to leave @entity5 to join one of @entity8 's giants			1
the defender , who is wanted by @entity10 at @entity11 , would become the sixth big - name star to join @entity13 or @entity14 if his transfer goes through this summer			1
@entity4 has bagged £ 96million in transfer fees in the process , but was he right to cash in on some of his most talented players ? @entity19 takes a look at the others who have made that long journey – and if @entity4 made the right decision			1
wanted man : @entity5 defender @entity1 could join rivals @entity13 this summer still smiling ? @entity4 has sold a number of players to @entity13 and @entity14 in recent seasons , but was he right to do so ? @entity29 bought for : £ 7million from @entity30 @entity5 : nicknamed ' @entity31 ' when he arrived but failed to win a trophy in his three years at @entity5			1
the closest he came was a 2 - 1 defeat to @entity35 in the 2006 league cup final , when he was sent off for a fracas with @entity39 and received a four - match ban			2
he was not always known for his work - rate but he did have some magic moments , earning a place in the @entity45 for the 2007/08 season and winning @entity48 's goal of the season for flicking the ball up on the edge of the box and smashing it on the volley over @entity54 against @entity55			0
in 2009 he scored another memorable goal against @entity57 in the quarter - final of the @entity59 , when he controlled the ball with his chest while running backwards then scored a bicycle kick into the bottom right corner			0
sold for : £ 25million @entity14 : he signed a five - year contract , only lasted three and almost half of that was on loan			1
@entity29 got off to a flyer when he scored in his opening four @entity14 games , becoming one of only six players to do so for a new club			1
but it went downhill from there			0
again , he won nothing there , his most memorable moment being when he scored against @entity5 and ran the full length of the pitch to celebrate in front of his old fans			1
in another controversial incident , again against @entity5 , @entity86 accused @entity29 of kicking him in the face and he was subsequently banned for three matches for it			1
verdict : hit @entity92 to blue : @entity29 became a figure of hate among @entity5 fans after joining @entity14 @entity97 bought for : £ 250,000 from @entity98 @entity5 : @entity4 personally went to @entity97 's family household in @entity100 , @entity101 , to convince him to sign for @entity5 and in 2003 he joined the club			1
in his first season he was largely back - up to @entity104 but played enough to become the youngest player , at 18 years and 10 months , to win the @entity106 in @entity5 's undefeated campaign			1
he added the 2005 @entity108 and 2004 @entity109 to that and was part of the side that was runner up in the 2006 @entity59			0
but he was another @entity5 player who grew tired of their failure to win trophies and ended his eight - year spell there in 2011			1
after signing for @entity14 , he said : ' it got to a point for me where i did n’t just want to challenge for the titles only to be disappointed in the final weeks of the season			1
i wanted to play for a club that would win them			2
transfer fee : £ 7million @entity14 : @entity97 's comments on leaving @entity5 may have been barbed , but , like @entity129 , he has found silverware has followed his move to @entity14			1
the left - back has twice won the @entity106 – again helping the club to their first ever title – and also the @entity135 and @entity109			2
he was initially back - up to @entity136 but managed to oust the @entity137 from the flank and make it his own			0
injuries have hampered him recently , but he signed a new four - year contract at the club last year which will keep him there until at least 2017 – so plenty more trophies could be on their way			0
verdict : miss fresh start : @entity97 has won two @entity106 titles since leaving the @entity148 for the @entity149 @entity86 bought for : £ 2.75million from @entity150 @entity5 : @entity86 's eight - year @entity5 career was both prolific and frustrating			1
he was plagued with injuries throughout and in the early stages fans were unsure if he was ever going to reach the potential with which he joined the club			0
but by the time he departed he had established himself as one of the hottest strikers in the world			0
at @entity5 he won the @entity108 in 2005 and @entity109 in 2004 and was their top goalscorer for four of the seasons he was there - half of them - and twice their player of the year			2
he also won the @entity165 award in his last season at the club , before his shock move to rivals @entity13			2
sold for : £ 24million @entity8 united : the @entity170 continued from where he left off at @entity5 and won the @entity165 award again in the first season at his new club			1
he was unstoppable that year and his 26 league goals fired @entity13 to the @entity106 title and they won the @entity109 at the end of that summer too			1
the 31 - year - old was one of the few bright sparks in @entity182 ' disastrous spell at the club and he ended the season with 30 goals			0
under his former @entity186 boss @entity10 , who he finished third at this summer 's @entity187 with , he has the chance to flourish even further			1
verdict : miss danger man : @entity5 fans were left frustrated by @entity86 's departure for @entity13 in 2012 @entity192 bought for : £ 6million from @entity193 @entity5 : @entity192 spent seven years at @entity5 during which he was one of the best full - backs in the country			1
he was part of the @entity108 winning side last season , but that was the only trophy he won at the club			0
he was chosen as right - back in the @entity45 in his first season in 2007/08 and again in the 2010/11 campaign			0
slightly soured his exit from the club by publicly turning down the offer of a two - year contract then joining one of their title rivals			0
sold for : free @entity14 : cynics would say he has only gone for the money , but the defender vehemently denied that after securing a three - year deal on wages of £ 150,000 - per - week , £ 60,000 more than he was on at @entity5			1
@entity192 said : ' first of all , i want to clear something up			0
i keep reading many things about me , about my salary and me being greedy			0
i stayed six or seven years with the same salary at @entity5			2
it 's clearly not for the money			0
personally , i just wanted a change			2
' only time will tell if he warms the bench or is an integral part of the side			0
verdict : undecided on the move : @entity192 is set for his first season at @entity14 after leaving the @entity148 on a free @entity129 bought for : £ 15.8million from @entity232 @entity5 : @entity4 again used his extensive @entity234 contacts to pluck a young @entity129 from the country			1
he was compared to @entity236 on arrival but , although showing his ability in flashes , he initially struggled for consistency and was not helped by breaking his leg in a pre-season match in 2009			0
in the 2010/11 season he really took off , twice winning their fans ' @entity243 for his displays and scoring 15 goals that campaign			0
he was nominated for the @entity248 and @entity250 award , losing out to @entity251 and @entity252			0
@entity4 was forced to sell the player that summer after he refused to sign a new deal and would 've been out of contract a year later , allowing him to sign pre-contract agreements in january			1
' football rules are made like that , that the player can be worth a lot of money today and nothing in six months , ' @entity4 said			1
' so it does n’t look completely logical but , at the end of the day , of course , we are forced into a decision like that for psychological and financial reasons			0
' sold for : £ 24million @entity14 : regardless of what @entity5 fans think – and their opinion of @entity129 has not been helped by his continual digs at his former club – when it comes to silverware the move has been a resounding success			1
in his debut season he helped @entity14 win their first ever @entity106 title and then added another one to the trophy cabinet last year			2
he has also won the @entity109 and a @entity135 there			0
despite this , his attitude has been such a problem that he was omitted from @entity101 's @entity187 squad this summer			2
former manager @entity287 once said , albeit in jest , ‘ i would like to give him a punch ' because of his attitude on the pitch			0
verdict : miss trouble : @entity4 was forced to cash in on @entity129 after the midfielder refused to sign a new deal @entity295 ' to quit ' @entity101 @entity296 bought for : £ 150,000 from @entity297 @entity5 : @entity296 joined @entity5 in february 2002 but did not make his first - team debut until the @entity109 final that summer			1
he was initially considered a utility player , as a defensive midfielder or right - back having played further forward earlier in his career			0
but in a stroke of genius , @entity4 moved him to centre - back for the start of the 2003/04 season and he quickly established himself as one of the most formidable defenders in the @entity106			2
that season he was at the heart of their defence , alongside @entity314 , in the title - winning @entity316 side who were unbeaten all season			0
he caught the tail end of @entity5 's trophy - laden spell and also picked up two @entity323 and two @entity324 during his seven years at the club			2
in april 2009 he handed in a transfer request – which was turned down – after a row with @entity328 , but eventually left the club that summer			2
sold for : £ 16million @entity14 : @entity296 was appointed club captain by @entity331 but had the armband taken away from him at the start of the 2010/11 season when @entity287 took over			1
he was still a part of @entity287 's first - team plans and would go on to win a @entity106 title , @entity108 and @entity109			0
his time at the club was mired in controversy , however , after he failed a drugs test in march 2011 and was banned for six months			0
it was the beginning of the end of his time at the club and he moved to @entity345 on a free transfer last summer			2
verdict : hit still at the top : @entity296 is now at @entity345 after swapping @entity5 for @entity14 back in 2009			1

defender @entity1 is wanted by @entity10 this summer
@entity4 has a *history* of selling players to @entity13 and @entity14
@entity86 , @entity129 and @entity29 among stars to have left the @entity356
@entity5 have made £ 96million by selling players to @entity13 and @entity14
