surgeons in @entity1 have for the first time performed a life - saving procedure on a tiny foetus inside its mother 's womb after practising on a grape			1
using a hair - fine wire , a miniature needle , a tiny balloon and a catheter they successfully carried out the operation on the unborn child 's heart - which is about the size of a walnut			1
it was a medical first for the surgical team at @entity20 , in @entity1 , and according to the @entity21 , it appears to have been a success			1
this meant the amount of blood coming into the heart was being severely restricted and it was backing up in the left ventricle			0
without the surgery , the child would likely have be born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome ( @entity48 ) - a life - threatening condition			1
quoted in the @entity1 news service , dr @entity51 , assistant professor at @entity52 and director of @entity54 , said : ' there is no question in my mind that without this procedure the baby would have had @entity48			2
' now the baby has a chance to have the left ventricle recover with some good function			0
' the footage shows the needle pull back and stop when it reaches the exact point of the foetus 's aortic valve , where a catheter is to be inserted to expand it practising for such a critical and exacting procedure , remarkably , involved using a jelly mould to replicate the mother 's body , and a single grape representing the foetal heart			1
a team of specialists carried out the nerve - wracking operation on september 25			2
the mother was given a local anaesthetic and the foetus was also given anaesthesia and a muscle relaxant so it would not move in the mother 's womb during the operation , the @entity21 said			0
video of the procedure shows the tiny needle being slowly inserted into the beating heart up until the exact point of the narrow aortic valve			1
this part of the procedure was performed by dr @entity51			0
next , paediatric interventional cardiologist dr @entity97 , of @entity98 , threaded a micro-wire , the same width as a hair , through a tiny hole running inside the length of the needle			2
the procedure was a medical first for the team at @entity20 , in @entity1 , pictured , and the first time it has been performed in @entity108 a tiny aortic balloon attached to a catheter was passed down along the wire and inflated to a width of 3.25mm , the @entity21 said , stretching and even tearing the narrow aortic valve			1
the balloon , wire and needle were then all removed , leaving the catheter in place			2
the surgeons said immediately after the insertion of the catheter , more blood was flowing into the foetal heart			0
the procedure was a first for @entity125			0
@entity128 hospital , in @entity126 , was the first to carry out the procedure , at its @entity130 , in 1989			0
