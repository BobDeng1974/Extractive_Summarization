things you never expect to see : a @entity3 bartender asking a customer whether it ’s five or six			1
at the time it was just five			2
later on , it was indeed six			0
then seven and – as @entity11 broke clear in the final minute – it could have been more			0
this was humiliation on an epic scale			1
to those watching in the bar on the corner of fashionable @entity19 here in @entity21 on tuesday night it signalled the end of a dream that – against their better judgement – they had started to believe in			1
that ’s about £ 30			0
or slightly less , depending on gender			0
you got free beer for that but everybody had come for the football			0
over the last few weeks here in @entity27 , a public initially sceptical about this @entity70 and their team ’s chances had allowed itself to be swept along			1
on tuesday night , though , it did n’t take long for @entity77 ’s team to show themselves for what they really are			1
by half - time , most people in this particular establishment had gone back to their food and their free bar			2
outside under an awning a couple of musicians had begun to warm up			0
the warning signs had been there from the start , of course			1
the first goal of this tournament was an own goal , scored by a @entity3			2
that day here in @entity21 , the home team needed a leg up from a referee to get by against @entity97			1
the problem with momentum and emotion , though , is that it clouds issues			0
realities of life and sport get forgotten and that ’s a good thing			0
it allows you to feel and think things that really are n’t logical			2
and that is how it has been here			0
how the media reacted : @entity113 's front page says ' will not cover ' , seeking to ignore any mention of the embarrassment ( and says how another goal was scored by @entity8 while they were editing it ) , while @entity118 list a few words of feeling ; @entity121 amongst them overreaction : @entity27 were looking backwards at @entity125 's injury , not forwards to the game i saw @entity27 play their second group games against @entity131 – a goalless draw – and @entity133 – a 4 - 1 win – and it was clear on both occasions that this was a @entity3 team carrying deeper flaws than perhaps any in the nation ’s history			1
even in beating @entity133 – just about the weakest team in the competition – @entity27 looked uncomfortable			1
across the back , they were awful			0
and that was with @entity146 – suspended for the @entity8 clash – in the team			1
rescued by @entity125 on that occasion , i suggested in my match report that @entity27 would run in to a hiding before long			1
the only surprise is that it took so long and that – when it came – it was so big			0
reaction : @entity155 blame ' @entity156 ' for the defeat , while @entity158 describe how a ' @entity159 ' at the @entity160 on tuesday evening humiliated : @entity27 striker @entity161 looks dejected as his side struggled to make an impression going forwards @entity165 in hands : @entity27 fans will be waking up to embarrassment on wednesday morning hope : @entity27 fans were convinced they could go all the way , despite being apprehensive before the tournament @entity171 : @entity172 tells @entity77 to ' @entity173 ' , as @entity174 says ' congratulations ' to the 1950 @entity27 side who lost in the final of the @entity70 at the @entity179 to @entity180 , the nation 's worst sporting night ... before tuesday night certainly , @entity27 provided us with a story we were happy to buy and the country with something to cling to			1
you only had to look down the squad list , though , to see where the problems lay			0
@entity161 , @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192			1
these are players that would not get many games between them in the @entity196			1
some have tried , and failed			0
this , remember , was a @entity70			0
@entity199 knows what players like @entity202 ’s @entity201 and @entity204 ’s @entity203 have done to upset @entity77 but certainly they should have been in his 23 , if not necessarily his starting @entity206 devastated : @entity3 newspapers stick the boot in to their fallen stars , with @entity210 calling the defeat an ' embarrassment for @entity212 ' , while @entity213 say @entity27 suffered the ' worst defeat in @entity215 ' work to do : @entity77 talks to his players after the devastating defeat @entity218 in @entity33 after devastating @entity8 win alternatives : @entity201 and @entity203 were both overlooked for @entity77 's 23 - man squad perhaps @entity77 knew what was coming after the scrappy penalty shootout victory over @entity225			1
' shame , @entity226 , @entity227 ' : @entity228 's take on the disaster on the pitch in @entity33 the @entity231 hit the crossbar in extra time that day and maybe the coach sensed then – if he had n’t before – that his squad was n’t good enough			2
certainly the manner in which they subsequently hacked @entity238 off the field in the last eight – and the faux commiserations that followed from the likes of @entity243 – were depressing			0
the nation , however , was almost delirious by then			0
such was the hysteria about @entity125 ’s injury that the build up to tuesday ’s game was spent with millions of people looking backwards , rather than forwards			2
perhaps @entity77 and his players did , too			2
against @entity8 they certainly played as though they had n’t prepared			1
even @entity125 , @entity254 , @entity255 and @entity256 between them would n’t have stopped this happening			1
those in yellow looked bereft with only half an hour gone and a nation felt their pain			0
none of these players earn a living in @entity27			1
as such , it will be a while before their public get to see them in a match that matters again			0
maybe that is part of the problem			0
maybe there are too many young @entity3 hidden in talent factories in @entity276 and the @entity277 now for their love for the yellow shirt to stay strong			2
@entity280 failure : back in the @entity160 , a fan holds their @entity125 mask up as they avert their eyes wet : a @entity27 fan walks in the rain after watching his side lose in @entity290 devastated : @entity243 is comforted by fellow defender @entity146 who was suspended for the clash who 's at fault ? @entity27 lost 7 - 1 in their own back yard , breaking a few unwanted records along the way what happened in @entity33 , though , was n’t above love or passion or desire			1
if there was ever a case of a team wanting something too much , then perhaps this was it			2
whatever the case , a dream is over and the humdrum beckons once again here			2
in my bar in @entity21 , the barman had only one thing left to wish for			0
' come on @entity314 , ' he said			0
video delight in @entity316 for @entity8 fans implosion : @entity27 's @entity319 cuts a lonely figure as @entity8 run riot in the semi final to put their 5 - 1 loss firmly behind cruise control : @entity326 is hoisted in the air by @entity328 as @entity8 secured their passage to the final running riot : @entity334 striker @entity333 celebrates scoring his first - half goal at the @entity160			1

@entity27 wakes up to the embarrassment of the 7 - 1 defeat by @entity8
this was humiliation on an epic scale , after they started to believe in the dream
one @entity3 newspaper ran the *headline* ' go to hell , @entity349 '
another ' congratulated ' the 1950 team for not being as bad @entity352 's
after their group stage *performances* against @entity97 , @entity131 and @entity133 , warning signs had been there
players like @entity161 , @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192 would not get many games between them in the @entity196
@entity125 , @entity254 , @entity255 and @entity256 between them would n’t have stopped this
