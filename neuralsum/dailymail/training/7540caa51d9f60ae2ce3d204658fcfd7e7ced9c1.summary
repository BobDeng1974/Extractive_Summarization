iconic : thirty years ago this month , influential teen magazine @entity0 launched and after its untimely close in 2004 , @entity1 have paid tribute thirty years ago this month influential teen magazine @entity0 landed on newsagents ' shelves			1
with its hunky cover stars ( @entity12 in a lilac satin shirt is just one example ) , sex tips and informative advice pages for girls who might have ' gone too far behind the bike sheds ' , @entity0 , as it came to be known , was the best thing about wednesdays			1
the publication folded in 2004 after losing a third of its readership , but @entity20 have paid tribute to the magazine that defined our teenage years ( and beyond ) with a brilliant open letter this week ... " @entity25 , we know you wo n't read this now that you 're gone , but we owe you a thank you			1
we only spent a few years together , but i 'll never forget them			1
when we met , we were n't ' just seventeen ' at all			1
we were barely 13 , stuck in small towns and dreaming of more			1
all we remember of our first encounter was that we were quickly smitten			1
with your advice ( yes to backcombed hair , no to sensible shoes ) , celebrity gossip and knowledge of all things boy - shaped , you were like the most popular girl at school â€¦ except you actually wanted to hang out with us			1
every wednesday we would hot - foot it to the newsagent and hand over 70p and revel in your company			1
the shop shelves were filled with other teen mags , but they were never as cool as you			2
ok , so you had a fondness for @entity50 from @entity51			2
but you also introduced us to @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55			2
although , as we learned from real life stories such as , ' suspended for loving @entity52 ' , it 's important to keep your celebrity crushes in perspective			2
while other mags swooned over 90210 heartthrob @entity61 , you leaned towards bad boy @entity62 who was much hotter			2
best friend : ' with your advice ( yes to backcombed hair , no to sensible shoes ) , celebrity gossip and knowledge of all things boy - shaped , you were like the most popular girl at school ' you championed outsiders and made us feel slightly less of one			2
you did n't flaunt flashy clothes or expensive make - up , but taught us how to make a banana face scrub - utilised pre-school disco			0
and when he still did n't ask us to dance , you helped us with ' @entity78 '			0
you taught us boys ( aka boyfs ) were fun - but friends were better			0
and you talked about sex a lot , which we did n't always quite understand but we still read and stored away for future knowledge			0
but despite our infatuation , in the end , it was us who dumped you for a glossier , more experienced crowd			0
although , they were never as fun as you			0
a few years later , you shortened your name to @entity0 , and only came out once a month			1
helpful advice : you taught us boys ( aka boyfs ) were fun - but friends were better			0
and you talked about sex a lot , which we did n't always quite understand but we still read and stored away for future knowledge teenagers were growing up fast and suddenly did n't feel the need for your sassy thinkpieces and cool quizzes			0
we feel sorry for them today with their @entity103 , they have n't had your knowing hand to guide them away from mistakes and towards self - confidence			0
we hoped we 'd meet again when we were older and working on a magazine			1
but in 2004 , you went away forever			1
followed by those other teen titles @entity111 , @entity112 and more !			0
we still miss you , but at least we 've got @entity62			0
