a giant volcano that covers the same area as the whole of the @entity3 has been discovered buried deep beneath the @entity4			0
@entity5 sits 1,000 miles east of @entity6 , along the @entity9 plate , its tip is 6,500 feet below the ocean surface and it stretches around 400 miles wide			1
after studying rock samples , scientists from the @entity12 believe the behemoth is the volcano that caused the underwater @entity9 mountain range to form between 130 and 145 million years ago and may be the largest volcano in the solar system - even wider than the giant @entity20 volcano on @entity21			1
the @entity5 volcano sits under the @entity4 along the @entity9 plate			1
scientists from the @entity12 made the discovery , which remained hidden because @entity5 sits 6,500 feet below the surface			0
scientists used core samples , radars and scans , pictured , to map the volcano 's size @entity5 is the largest feature of the @entity9 mountain range , marked by @entity32 on this map , situated around 1,000 miles east of @entity6			1
the range was formed following the eruption of the @entity5 volcano between 130 and 145 million years ago @entity5 covers an area of about 120,000 square miles - an area roughly equivalent to the @entity37			1
it is 400 miles wide and its tip sits 6,500 feet below the ocean 's surface			2
@entity5 is also thought to sit in water around four miles deep			2
the largest volcano on @entity44 is @entity46 ’s @entity45 that covers approximately 2,000 square miles - just two per cent of the size of @entity5			2
the @entity20 volcano on @entity21 is n't as wide as @entity5 - stretching 370 miles across - but it 's overall mass is approximately 25 per cent larger than @entity5			1
@entity5 is around 145 million years old but ' became inactive within a few million years after it was formed '			1
@entity51 , a professor in the @entity52 at the university , began studying the volcano 20 years ago			2
@entity5 is the largest feature of the @entity9 , which was formed following the eruption of several underwater volcanoes			2
until now , scientists were unsure whether @entity5 was a single volcano , or was made up of multiple eruption points			0
the team of researchers studied core samples , radars and data collected from the region to confirm that the huge mass of basalt that makes up the volcano erupted from a single source near the centre			0
@entity51 said : ' @entity5 is the biggest single shield volcano ever discovered on @entity44			0
' there may be larger volcanoes , because there are bigger igneous features out there such as the @entity77 , but we do n't know if these features are one volcano or complexes of volcanoes			0
' @entity51 continued that @entity5 stands out among underwater volcanoes not only because of its size , but also its unusual shape			0
this chart shows the @entity5 's location along the @entity9 - a mountain range beneath the @entity4			1
a single eruption from the volcano is thought to have caused the range to form between 130 and 145 million years ago			1
the chart also shows @entity5 's relative size to @entity21 ' @entity20 volcano it is said to be ' low and broad ' , which suggests the erupted lava flows would have travelled longer distances compared to other volcanoes known about on @entity44			1
other underwater volcanoes are predominantly small and steep			0
' it ’s not high , but very wide , so the flank slopes are very gradual , ' said @entity51			0
' in fact , if you were standing on its flank , you would have trouble telling which way is downhill			0
' we know that it is a single immense volcano constructed from massive lava flows that emanated from the center of the volcano to form a broad , shield - like shape			0
the @entity20 volcano on @entity21 , pictured , is thought to be the largest in the solar system			1
it is around three miles narrower than the @entity5 but has an overall mass thought to be 25 per cent bigger the next largest volcano on @entity44 is @entity46 's @entity45 , pictured			1
it covers 2,000 square miles - around two per cent of the size of @entity5 before now , we did n't know this because oceanic plateaus are huge features hidden beneath the sea			2
' they have found a good place to hide			0
' @entity5 covers an area of about 120,000 square miles - an area roughly equivalent to the @entity37			0
the largest volcano on @entity44 is @entity46 ’s @entity45 that covers approximately 2,000 square miles - just two per cent of the size of @entity5			2
the @entity20 volcano on @entity21 is n't as wide as @entity5 - stretching 370 miles across - but it 's overall mass is said to be approximately 25 per cent larger than @entity5			1
@entity51 added that @entity5 is around 145 million years old but ' became inactive within a few million years after it was formed '			1
the project was funded by the @entity132 and the findings appear in the @entity135 journal .			0

the 400 - mile wide @entity5 volcano sits 1,000 miles east of @entity6
it was *originally* believed to be part of the @entity9 plate
rock samples suggest it formed around *140* million years ago
@entity5 is thought to be wider than @entity145 's @entity20 volcano
