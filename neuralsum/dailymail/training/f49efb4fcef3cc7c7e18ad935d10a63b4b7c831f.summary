by @entity0 @entity1 : 07:23 est , 13 december 2013 @entity2 : 07:40 est , 13 december 2013 worn in a dishevelled , boho way all summer , the oversized topknot was the go - to hairdo for relaxed sunny days			1
but with the @entity8 season in full swing , the topknot is due a sophisticated , polished update			1
elegant actress @entity11 rocked this look at the @entity14 party in @entity15 last week			2
and with the voluminous style showing no signs of falling out of fashion , celebrity hairdresser @entity16 guarantees it will be the most glamorous way to keep your hair tidy all night this @entity8			1
here , in @entity24 's exclusive step - by - step guide , @entity16 styles @entity27 writer @entity26 with a party topknot using a bun @entity29 down for video @entity16 guarantees the voluminous topknot will be the most glamorous way to keep your hair tidy @entity16 explains that the pre-prepared topknots is used for red carpet looks all the time @entity11 at a @entity14 event on sunday , working the voluminous topknot the first step in creating this red carpet look is backcombing the hair at the crown of the head			1
this step is key , as it created cushioning and support for the hair piece			0
@entity44 right to the ends and round the front as well as the back of the hair			0
once that 's done , pin it in place with kirby grips			2
backcomb the roots of the surrounding area for further support			0
@entity16 says the key to this look is backcombing the top section which supports the hair piece for cushioning , backcomb to the ends , from all sides and pin			1
then , backcomb the roots of the surrounding hair next we need to decide how much of the hair we 're leaving out - in @entity26 's case the sweeping fringe - and part it accordingly			2
the sweeping fringe is a great alternative for ladies who find scraping all the hair away from their face too severe and prefer to leave something to frame their features			0
also , those who have a fringe already can leave that down			0
otherwise you can opt for @entity11 's look for the fashionista edge			2
clip any hair you 're leaving down out of the way and backcomb the roots of the rest of the hair			0
pin it up as you go			0
@entity16 decides how much to leave out at the front - here , the sweeping fringe - and backcombs the rest now we attach the hair piece - here we 're using the @entity95 Â£ 29.99 @entity94 in colour 33 , a @entity97 shade			1
it 's great because it 's an exact colour match to @entity26 's natural hair - and it has clever grips hidden on the inside , use plenty of kirby grips to secure in - the last thing we want is the piece to fall out			1
i 'm making sure @entity26 can party all night			0
@entity109 is putting the hairpiece on - it 's great as it has grips on @entity16 says for red carpet looks kirby grips tend to help out hairdressers a lot - he uses plenty for this look take the first piece of the remaining hair and start to pin it in around the hairpiece			1
begin with one section from each side , first left , then right , and wrap round on opposite sides for a twist effect it 's really nice to blend the natural hair with the hair form the hair piece			0
spray with hairspray to secure as you go			0
what 's nice - and what makes this twist and topknot look editorial and red carpet - is the hair has a really natural movement feel to it			2
@entity16 brushes the hair , pulls it section by section around the bun and secures , noting the brilliant colour match the twist and topknot , despite being very secure , has a really nice natural movement feel to it @entity26 loves this look - something she can create at home and still look like she 's going on the red carpet			1
