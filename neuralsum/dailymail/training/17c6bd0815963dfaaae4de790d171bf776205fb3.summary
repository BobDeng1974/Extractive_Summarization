by @entity0 there could still be a place for sir @entity3 at @entity4 despite saying his @entity5 days are behind him , insists sir @entity6			1
the @entity4 chief was responding to the rider ’s claim that road cycling is cut - throat , whereas the track ‘ feels more like a family and a closer - knit group of people			1
’ he said : ‘ we ’re talking to @entity3 and his management team and ideally we ’d like to find a solution to support him through to @entity18 ( the 2016 @entity19 )			1
‘ i think it ’d be more creative in terms of what would help him get to where he needs to be for @entity18			0
‘ we ’d certainly like to get behind him and support him			0
’ before the @entity37 , @entity4 supported three riders — @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 — whose main goal was the team pursuit			2
@entity6 was performance director of @entity44 , a position he left this year , but he said he would still be willing to support @entity24 ’ track ambition			1
