by @entity1 reporter published : 20:20 est , 31 january 2014 updated : 20:21 est , 31 january 2014 school support staff are being forced to deal with an increasing number of pupils who have not been toilet trained , an education leader has warned			0
the issue is putting extra pressure on workers who are already over-burdened , according to dr @entity11 , general secretary of the @entity12 ( @entity12 )			2
her comments come as a survey by the union found that eight in ten nursery and primary school support staff - such as teaching assistants - in @entity19 say that they are expected to deal with children who have wet or soiled themselves			1
extra pressure : 80 per cent of school support staff have had to deal with children who have ' accidents ' almost 90 per cent of the 277 questioned said that they had not received any training on how to deal with the issue , while almost 70 per cent said that helping children who have had an accident is not part of their contract or job description			1
a similar proportion ( 68.6 % ) said that their school or nursery does not have a written policy for dealing with incontinence and toilet training problems , while three quarters ( 76.9 % ) said parents do not have to provide written permission for their child to be changed			0
untrained : a survey by the @entity12 found that many children come to school without knowing how to use the toilet dr @entity11 said : ' having to deal with increasing numbers of pupils who have not yet been toilet trained puts extra pressure on education staff when they already have enough pressure on them			1
' it is worrying that such a high number of support staff have received no training in dealing with such issues , yet they are expected to deal with pupils , and even though it is not formally within their job description			0
' schools need to give staff clear guidance on how to deal with toileting accidents so they know what they are allowed to do and who should be dealing with an incident			2
' it is also important that education staff feel they have support from their school nurse or head , and that they know where to obtain guidance should they need it			0
' a survey published by @entity12 in 2012 found that almost two - thirds of primary school staff say they have seen an increase in youngsters having accidents during the school day over the past five years			1
this figure rose to 71 per cent among teachers working with three to five - year - olds .			0
