did you have sex on the weekend ? did you at least think about it ? or has sex moved from something that was on the agenda , to an activity that 's not even considered any more ? according to a study by @entity9 sex columnnist @entity8 of married couples aged 36 - 55 , 44 per cent had sex weekly , 32 had sex monthly , 11 per cent had sex annually , 9 per cent never have sex and 4 per cent had sex every day			1
' does n't every married couple stop having sex once they 're been together ages ? ' a friend asked me once			1
the answer is a lot do			0
a lot of couples get divorced as well – and like it or not , there 's a definite link			2
if a couple are having good , regular sex , it accounts for around 20 % of total relationship satisfaction			2
if the couple stop having sex or sex is n't enjoyable , it 's relationship cryptonite and poisons everything – even if you both agree to take it off the table			2
if you 're pushing 90 and need a @entity51 to move around in bed , i can understand why you might give up on sex			2
i also acknowledge there are couples out there where both partners have zero or extremely low libidos and seriously are n't bothered by a future which does n't include any sex			1
but how many couples truly do fall into this category ? @entity63 believes that a lack of sex correlates with divorce the thing is , the chances of finding and hooking up with someone who has exactly the same sex drive as you – high , low or middling - is extremely rare			1
even couples who pride themselves on having evenly matched desire levels can point to discrepancies when pushed : one inevitably fancying it more than the other in certain situations			2
which means , in my opinion , pretty much everyone who stops having sex is risking their relationship			0
we get more from sex than we think			0
not only does it keep us physically satisfied , it provides much - needed excitement and stimulation in our lives			0
sex makes us feel wanted and attractive , needed and admired			1
we feel emotionally connected to the person we 're having sex with : touching and orgasm releases endorphins ( feel good chemicals ) which create a feeling of well being			1
satisfying sex also boosts our immune system and promotes production of a substance called oxytocin , making us feel warm and snuggly			1
because it makes our blood pump furiously , sex is good for the heart in a physical sense , but also in an emotional capacity			1
humans are driven to seek pleasure and sex encourages our body to release the pleasure substance , @entity111 ( phenylethylamine ) , making us feel light - headed and light - hearted			1
sex reduces stress and frustration levels , makes our skin glow , our hair shine and our eyes sparkle			1
and you want to give all this up ? are you serious ? even if you do n't want to reconsider given all this information , your partner may well do			0
here 's another thing : it 's easy to forget how good sex is and how all of the above feels , when you 're not getting any			0
but there will come a time when you 're reminded of how good it was			0
you 're away on a business trip , working late and eating in the hotel restaurant , and the friendly , attractive waiter leans forward to clear your food away and you get a whiff of his aftershave and out of nowhere , suddenly you remember and all those memories of hot , frantic , fabulous sex rush back at alarming speed			2
even sexed - up couples feel the pull of ' why not ? ' in situations like this			1
how are you ( or your partner ) going to cope when you have n't had sex for months or years ( even if voluntarily ) and you know having your appetite reawakened means nothing because the bored - with - sex partner at home , has n't had the same experience			2
yes , you could try racing home and saying ' honey , i remember how great sex was ! let 's do it up against the wall like we used to ! '			0
but if you honestly think that 'll be greeted with a yawn , disapproving frown and ' i thought we discussed we were n't doing that anymore ' sniff , next time you might well opt to chat up the dishy waiter			0
or that guy on the bus who you 've started chatting to lately , feeling an oddly familiar stirring below as you do so			0
no matter how much your partner loves you , no matter how much they or you believe they 're immune to temptation , they 're not			0
stop having sex with each other and you risk both of you wanting to have sex with someone else			0
so if your excuse for not ' doing it ' is simply that neither of you feel like it anymore because you 've been together ' forever ' and it seems like ' such an effort ' and you 'd both ' really honestly watch telly together ' , perhaps you might like to have a little rethink			0
