heart disease is on of the world 's biggest killers - in 2012 , an estimated 17.5 million people died worldwide , and numbers are steadily rising			1
efforts to battle heart disease continue , and scientists are painstakingly conducting research into everything from stem cell technology to the behaviour of blood flow in a bid to fight back			1
to celebrate the @entity16 's groundbreaking research , it held a photography competition showcasing the striking visuals that can come from biological imaging			1
the clot thickens : this image shows a blood clot in close detail			1
the thick grey mesh is the clot , capturing a mixture of different cells – seen in different colours			2
a bhf - funded researcher in the 1970s was the first to prove that clots can cause heart attacks the overall winner of ‘ @entity33 ’ was an image of a blood clot that could easily be mistaken for a coral reef			1
the incredible ' panoramic ' is named ' the clot thickens ' and displays what looks likes deep , dark caverns holding what look like tiny sea anemones			1
but these tiny ' creatures ' are in fact an array of cells that have been caught up in the blood clot as it dries			1
it was submitted by @entity49 , a bhf - funded researcher based at the @entity50			0
indeed it was a @entity16 - funded researcher in the 1970s was the first to prove that clots can cause heart attacks			1
seeing is believing : this image shows the intricate network of newly - formed blood vessels in the retina of a mouse eye			2
understanding how blood vessels grow is an important part of understanding cardiovascular disease another finalist , named ' scaffolding ' , was taken by dr @entity65 , a @entity16 - funded researcher at @entity66			1
for her research she uses scaffolds containing microscopic holes to grow healthy heart cells that could potentially be implanted into a patient ’s damaged heart after a heart attack			2
no smoke without fire : this picture is a blood vessel that does n’t work properly and is leaking			0
the blood vessel is seen in red , with the leaks seen in grey			0
maintaining healthy blood vessels is vital to prevent cardiovascular disease lifelines : using the same computer modelling programmes that engineers use to design aeroplanes , scientists can now precisely model the blood flow in our blood vessels ( pictured )			2
these models can be used to design better techniques for dialysis , for example the colourful ' lifelines ' was taken by dr @entity97 , another @entity16 - funded researcher at @entity66			2
using the same computer modelling programmes that engineers use to design aeroplanes , he precisely models the flow in blood vessels			0
these models can be used to design better techniques for kidney dialysis that limit the disruption to a patient ’s natural blood flow			0
made from stem cells : the banding seen in this microscopic view of heart muscle cells is vital for the contraction of the muscle that is needed for the heart to beat			0
scientists can make heart cells from stem cells and study how changes in this banding cancause abnormal heartbeats another highly commended image was the striking ' seeing is believing ' , by dr @entity125 , a @entity16 - funded researcher in the @entity127 , @entity128 at @entity66			1
the image shows the intricate network of newly - formed blood vessels in the retina of a mouse eye			2
understanding how blood vessels grow is an cart part of understanding cardiovascular disease			0
' heart cells made from stem cells ' looks like it could be a close - up of a butterfly wing			2
it was taken by dr @entity142 , a researcher at the @entity143			0
the banding seen in the microscopic view of heart muscle cells is vital for the contraction of the muscle so that the heart can beat			0
@entity16 - funded scientists can now make heart cells from stem cells and study how changes in this banding can lead to the heart not beating properly			1
scaffolding ( pictured ) containing microscopic holes are pictured here			0
they could help grow healthy heart cells that could potentially be implanted into a patient ’s damaged heart after a heart attack the bold no smoke without fire , was captured by dr @entity162 , a researcher from the @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity66 the image displays a blood vessel that does n’t work properly and is leaking			1
the blood vessel is seen in red , with the leaks seen in grey			0
maintaining healthy blood vessels is vital to prevent cardiovascular disease			0
