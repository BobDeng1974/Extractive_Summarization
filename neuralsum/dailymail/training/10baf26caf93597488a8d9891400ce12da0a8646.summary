winter is officially here - but in future years , it could look very different , researchers have said			2
they have created a series of maps showing how climate change will change @entity8 's winters dramatically			1
data was also used to see that winters are getting wetter in the @entity10			1
' in the big picture , the @entity10 has seen a number of climate shifts in the cold season over the past 40 years or so , ' said @entity14 , which created the maps			1
since 1970 , the average winter temperature in the continental @entity10 has warmed by 2.4 ° f since 1970			1
' that ’s faster than the planet as a whole , which has warmed 1.1 ° f over that same period , due in large part to rising human greenhouse gas emissions			1
' the team 's maps reveal that certain regions have seen heat rises far greater than the average			1
the @entity36 leads the charge as the fastest - warming region followed by the @entity39			2
the @entity41 and @entity42 , by contrast , have warmed relatively slowly			2
the only notable cold spots are in eastern @entity44 and southern @entity45			0
the @entity46 has seen rises of just @entity48 since 1970 - whereas the upper midwest has seen a huge @entity51 boost to its winter temperatures			1
in @entity8 's @entity42 , a 3.0c rise was recorded , while in the @entity39 a much larger 5.4c boost was uncovered since 1970 the researchers also looked at rain			2
' a large swath in the middle of the country from @entity60 to @entity61 has seen an uptick in precipitation			0
' the @entity64 have also gotten wetter , which is good news to skiers ( though that 's tempered by rising temperatures )			2
' at the same time , the @entity69 and @entity70 have gotten somewhat drier			0
' despite the current drought afflicting @entity73 , the long - term trend shows that winters have gotten wetter in a large chunk of the state			0
this wet season appears off to a better start than the past two , but with record heat baking soils to their driest levels in at least 1,200 years , a lot more rain is needed this winter to bust the drought			1
it comes as heatwaves and prolonged spells of freezing weather have become more common over the past three decades , according to scientists			0
the @entity64 have also gotten wetter , which is good news for skiers , while the @entity90 has seen a @entity92 rise @entity8 's south saw a rise of @entity95 since 1970 , which equates to .88c per year , while the southeast saw a @entity99 rise researchers at the @entity101 found that extreme weather conditions have been occurring more frequently in the past 30 years compared to a 130 year average			1
meteorologists have said that 2014 is on track to the be warmest year on record			1
figures published by the @entity108 predicted that the global mean temperature for 2014 is 0.01 degrees c warmer than 2010 , currently the warmest on record at 14.50 degrees c ( @entity111 ) this is despite much of the northern hemisphere being plunged into temperatures well below freezing in january as @entity8 was hit by an @entity116 polar vortex			1
according to the latest findings from the @entity101 's climatic research unit , temperatures in the northern hemisphere have been more volatile than in the southern hemisphere			1
average global temperatures for 2014 have been higher than average and may even break previous records extreme heatwaves in @entity126 like the one that killed tens of thousands in 2003 could happen every other year by 2040s , the @entity108 has warned			1
they claim that the chances of extreme heatwaves in @entity126 have increased from occurring once in every 1,000 years to around one a century			0
extremely warm summers that would be expected to occur twice a century in the early 2000s are also now likely to happen twice a decade , according to the research in the journal @entity136			0
dr @entity137 , co-author of the study , warned that projections of future climate change suggest that by the end of the century summers like that seen in 2003 could be considered ' unusually cool '			0
he said : ' this paper shows how our vulnerability to heat extremes is rapidly changing and we expect that to continue going forward			0
' professor @entity148 , who led the work , said : ' trends in extreme heat and cold are important because they have a large impact on water supplies , agricultural productivity and other factors related to human health and wellbeing			0
' improved understanding of the spatial patterns of change are vital for understanding the causes of recent extreme weather events			0
' the researchers , whose findings are published in the journal @entity167 , analysed monthly temperature records at set points around the world between 1881 and 2013			1
the found that on average through the 130 - year period , periods of unusually cold weather increased in frequency more than extreme heatwaves			2
this led to a narrowing of the range of the @entity182 's temperatures , they said			2
however , in the past 30 years , the researchers found that the pattern has been reversed with incidences of hot weather increasing at a faster rate			0
extreme weather can bring chaos to transport systems while causing billions of pounds worth of damage and hundreds of thousands of deaths around the world each year			0
an estimated 31,000 people died in the @entity195 as a result of bitter temperatures during the winter of 2012/2013			1
during december 2013 and january 2014 , 200 million people were blasted by icy temperatures as arctic winds brought heavy snow to much of @entity8			1
temperatures fell as low as -38 ° @entity204 ) in @entity205 while @entity206 saw its lowest temperature since 1979			1
the cold air reached as far south as @entity209 that reportedly saw temperatures plunge below − 9 ° @entity211 )			1
the conditions are estimated to have cost the @entity213 more than $ 5 billion and saw widespread power failures across large swathes of @entity216			0
in some areas , temperatures were so low that it led to residents being able to throw pots of boiling water and watching them freeze before the water hit the ground			2
by contrast , in 2003 , around 30,000 people died across @entity126 during a summer heatwave , where temperatures in some areas reached more than 104 ° f ( 40 ° c )			1
professor @entity231 , from @entity232 , who also took part in the study , said : ' arguably , these cold extremes and warm extremes are the most important factors for human society			0
' he added that the study could help to explain the ' pause ' in global warming since 1998 that was reported by the @entity241 last year			0
the new study showed that while warming continued in most parts of the planet , it was offset by a strong cooling during the winter months in the @entity247			2
prof @entity231 said : ' there really has n't been a pause in global warming			0
there has been a pause in @entity247 winter warming			2
' it comes after separate research , published in the journal @entity136 , found that the chances of heatwaves in @entity126 have increased in the past decade			0
the likelihood of @entity261 heatwaves , such as the one in 2003 , have also increased tenfold , from being a one in 1,000 year event to occurring around once in a century			0
by the 2040s , such extreme heatwaves could happen every other year if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise , the researchers at the @entity108 claimed .			0

maps were created to show how temperatures has changed since 1970 in all @entity10 regions
since 1970 , the average winter temperature in the continental @entity10 has warmed by 2.4 °
findings come amid prediction that 2014 is likely to be warmest on record
