and @entity160 , a graduate trainee at consultants @entity161 , quit in december 2009 after sending an email discussing attractive male staff			0

yours are obvious by their absence and i feel sorry for you			0
unfortunately for @entity50 , he has fallen in love with you and @entity50 being @entity50 , i gather it is not easy to reason with him or yet encourage him to consider how he might be able to help you			0
it may just be possible to get through to you though			0
if you want to be accepted by the wider @entity50 family i suggest you take some guidance from experts with utmost haste			1
there are plenty of finishing schools around			0

here are a few examples of your lack of manners : i understand your parents are unable to contribute very much towards the cost of your wedding			0
( there is nothing wrong with that except that convention is such that one might presume they would have saved over the years for their daughters ’ marriages			0
) if this is the case , it would be most ladylike and gracious to lower your sights and have a modest wedding as befits both your incomes .			0
