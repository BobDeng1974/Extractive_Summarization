by @entity0 published : 07:11 est , 25 april 2012 updated : 07:45 est , 25 april 2012 older people are a benefit , rather than a burden , to the economy and society according to a new report			1
researchers from the @entity8 refute the view that older people are a major source of economic problems such as reduced international competitiveness			2
their study provides evidence that the benefits of living longer will outweigh the additional health and social care costs of population ageing			1
positive effect : the elderly contribute billions to the economy , according to a @entity23 study ‘ all too often old age is seen as a time of increasing dependency , vulnerability and frailty			1
but older people already contribute significantly to their families ’ and wider communities ’ wellbeing , ’ said dr @entity24 , co-author of the report			2
life expectancy at 65 has increased by six years since the 1950s			0
as people live longer they stay healthier , at any given age			0
such advances have partly been generated by the pharmaceutical revolution of 1950 ‐ 2000			0
medicines for conditions such as heart attacks , strokes and diabetes , are now well understood and have already contributed significantly to falling death and disability rates , despite problems such as obesity			0
‘ in future decades , greater participation by people in their 60s and 70s in formal and informal work , alongside additional decreases in the number of life years spent with major disabilities , could increase national productivity by up to 10 per cent of @entity59 , ’ said dr @entity24			0
one example of how those of more advancing years contribute to the economy is @entity65 - based handyman service @entity63 , which operates a policy of employing men of more advancing years , with one aged 62 and until recently another aged 68			2
operations manager @entity68 told @entity69 : ' we find that because of their experience and exposure to life they have a calmer approach to the job - they 're more confident and female customers are certainly more at ease with the elderly guys			0
' in the 1980s and 1990s estimates indicate that just 0.2 per cent of the annual increase in @entity82 spending was caused by population ageing			0
benefit : hospital costs for the elderly are outweighed by their positive contribution to the economy even though the current figure is in the order of one per cent per annum such cost increases have been outweighed by the positive contribution of £ 40 billion that adults aged 65 and over made to the @entity95 economy in 2010			1
it is estimated that by 2030 retired ‘ baby boomers ’ will contribute £ 80 billion to the economy			1
the team points out that even if older people do need long term supportive care , they wo n’t be a burden on the economy			2
co-author professor @entity105 said : ‘ for instance , the extra public cost of the recent @entity108 proposals for making residential and community care more fairly available in @entity111 would , if implemented , probably be under 0.2 per cent of current @entity95 @entity113			1

over- *65s* added £ 40bn to the @entity95 economy in 2010
@entity118 ' baby boomers ' will have fed £ 80bn into the economy by 2030 , according to a study
