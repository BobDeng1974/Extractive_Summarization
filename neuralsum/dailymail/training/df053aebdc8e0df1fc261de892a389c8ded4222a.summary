by @entity0 the truth is one i have only recently acknowledged , but i am in no doubt now that it is universal : if you have a husband , you should also get a shed			1
all married men need one — a place where they can do important things such as tinker with perfectly functioning bikes , read comics and drink @entity15 tea ( for an average of around 26 days a year , as one recent report conservatively estimated )			1
for years , ‘ heading to the shed ’ has been a technique for escaping ’ er indoors			1
but while men may have always been allowed to think it ’s their idea to get a shed , i now realise it ’s women who really drive the plan			1
@entity0 is more than happy to let her husband lock himself away in the shed while she gets on with writing sheds , i have discovered , are essential places in which to contain a husband			1
and for every man who ’s smugly congratulating himself on breaking out for some sneaky man time , you can bet there ’s a wife breathing a huge sigh of relief at having him out from under her feet			1
i think i may have struck upon the cure for our soaring divorce rate which , tellingly , is particularly prolific among the over- 60s — the age that retirement sets in and couples suddenly find themselves permanently , and seemingly maddeningly , rubbing shoulders under one roof			1
simply make sure he has a mini , felted roof of his own			1
until recently i was n’t lucky enough to have a shed in my life			1
so my husband of 41 years , @entity50 , was on the loose			1
and as a selfish writer who works from home , this spelt disaster			1
i am the sort who needs total quiet and isolation when i ’m writing			1
i am in awe of writers who work alongside their partners			1
@entity62 wrote side by side with her husband , @entity65 , in the same room ; twin typewriters next to each other			2
can you imagine ? author @entity70 has her husband , @entity71 , who sadly is suffering from dementia , with her at all times			2
i have nothing but respect for them both			2
author @entity62 with husband @entity65 , who she writes side by side with @entity50 and i used to settle ourselves at opposite ends of our one - and - a - half - bedroom flat in @entity83 , and i still could n’t manage it			2
the ‘ half ’ was my office , and @entity50 — a crazy film - maker type — had an office in town where he went daily			2
but modern technology meant he could do a lot of his work — running an online arts website — from home			2
this meant the @entity97 family scenario during the week went as follows : ‘ are you going into work now ? ’ i ’d say , ever - so - casually after breakfast , at around 9am			2
‘ yes , ’ @entity50 would say			2
‘ i ’ve got a meeting at 11am			2
’ a t that point , i would retreat to my office and pretend to start writing			0
in reality , i ’d be sitting waiting for sounds that he was going — the blessed shout of goodbye that meant i could start scribbling in peace			0
not because he was making a noise as such , but because he was there , lurking			0
after a while , i ’d pop back out			0
‘ how ’s it going ? ’ i ’d ask , nonchalantly			0
‘ @entity116 , ’ he ’d reply			0
‘ are you off soon ? ’ i ’d persist			0
then he ’d look hurt			0
‘ ok , ok , i ’m going in a minute			0
i do n’t see what difference it makes me being here — i ’m not making a sound			0
’ @entity0 says having her own space has helped her to be successful and another row would ensue , me incoherently trying to explain why his silent presence was as annoying as nails on a blackboard			1
i ’m sure anyone reading this is probably feeling sorry for @entity50 right now			0
i was being a bit of a harridan , wanting to chuck my husband out of his own home			0
but i could n’t write with him there , not in that tiny space — and it became crucial to the harmony of our relationship and ongoing success of my career that this chucking out issue got sorted			1
so , this year , we made the momentous decision to move out of @entity83 — where i ’ve lived for more than six decades — to find somewhere bigger , more peaceful , where @entity50 could have his own office at home			0
still , at the back of my mind , i was worried			0
would n’t it be the same as in the flat : @entity50 in his new office , me in the next room , itching to have the house all to myself ? as soon as we stepped through the door of any potential home , i immediately scanned the bedroom situation to see if there would be enough separation			0
and mostly there was n’t			0
then we walked into this small cottage by the coast in @entity166 , and i spied the answer to all our problems : a shed			0
hallelujah ! a converted garage across the small garden , already kitted out as an office , and a thousand miles away from the lovely spare bedroom — my space — in the attic			1
we decided to take it straight away			0
and here we are , four months later , settled into our new place near the sea			0
@entity50 still goes up to @entity83 a couple of days a week , but the time he is at home is happily spent in our marriage - saving shed			1
now and again i ’ll take him a cup of tea , sometimes even make him lunch , and encourage him in his latest endeavour			1
all i need to do now is make sure he never , ever retires			0
@entity0 ’s new novel , @entity188 , is out on october 9 , published by @entity189			1

all men need a space in which to tinker with functioning bikes , read comics and drink @entity15 tea
married couples need to escape from each other from time to time says @entity0
having space to write has become crucial to the harmony of @entity0 *'s* relationship and the ongoing success of her career
