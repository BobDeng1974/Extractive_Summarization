by @entity0 unlike on @entity3 , rolling down a window to air out a foul odor is not an option in the vacuum of space			2
so , for the last nearly 40 years , @entity7 has employed a master smeller to sniff out foul odors before they make life unbearable for our intrepid astronauts			1
meet @entity13 of the @entity14 in @entity15 , who puts his highly - trained nose to everything from lab items to personal keepsakes that could bake in the atmosphere - free heat of space to become shockingly stinky			1
' i actually use my sense of smell to help protect the astronauts from obnoxious odors in space , ' @entity13 told odditycentral.com			1
' i feel like i ’m a bodyguard for the astronauts			0
' tougher than it looks : @entity13 has been smelling things that @entity7 intends to take into space for nearly 40 years there was even an instance in earlier days of space exploration when a @entity34 mission was actually aborted early because of an unbearable stench			1
one reason objects are so stinky in space is the 90 - minute night / day cycle , notes @entity39			0
every hour and a half , the cabin is in very hot daylight that causes objects to off - gas potentially offensive fumes			0
for some of his ' missions , ' @entity13 and his team of sniffers basically bake samples of what 's being taken into space in an oven for days to mimic space 's harsh conditions			1
space stench : in space , even something as simple as a watch can turn from innocent object to malodorous menace in the 90 - minute day to night cycle of outer space where temperatures cause serious off - gassing overwhelming : a @entity34 mission was once aborted a month before it was scheduled to end because a smell became so overwhelming to cosmonauts then they smell them			2
a sample of the air around the sample is sucked into a syringe and then plunged into a face mask			0
' i ’ll - take - the - bullet type thing , before you are actually subjected to it , ' he said			0
even after all these years , @entity13 can still be surprised by how profoundly the conditions of space can turn a simple thing like newspaper ink into a malodorous menace			2
' in my mind , i 'm not really expecting them to be that bad , ' he once told @entity39			0
' i guess what you worry about more than anything else is the stinky or pungent one , where it bites or burns up your nose			0
' no one can hear you gag : thanks to @entity13 's intrepid nose , missions on the space station can expect a fresh scent , or at least fresher than it could be			1
space is notoriously stinky for astronauts , thanks to the enclosed atmosphere of the cabin , and even space itself is said to smell like scorched metal			2

@entity13 has been sniffing every object astronauts take to space at @entity14 in @entity15 for nearly 40 years
he protects space station astronauts from noxious odors that can become so overwhelming in the closed space that they end missions
