@entity0 today said immigrants suffering from ‘ life - threatening diseases ’ should not be allowed into @entity3			1
the @entity5 leader defended his call for foreigners suffering from @entity8 to be banned from moving to the @entity3 – and said he would stop ‘ people with tuberculosis too ’			1
@entity11 , the party ’s first mp , was left struggling to defend the remarks today after using his victory speech late last night to urge his party to speak with ‘ compassion ’			1
mr @entity11 ’s highly respected father @entity17 also diagnosed the first confirmed cases of @entity19 in @entity20 and inspired the character @entity21 in @entity23 's novel @entity22			1
on a walkabout in @entity36 today , mr @entity11 said : ‘ i agree with everything that @entity0 has said and we need an @entity40 type immigration system			1
’ @entity8 charity the @entity41 said the @entity5 leader 's remarks displayed a ‘ new level of ignorance ’			1
‘ the idea that having @entity8 should be used as a black mark against someone 's name is ridiculous and shows an outrageous lack of understanding of the issue , ’ the charity 's chief executive @entity46 said			1
she added : ‘ in bracketing those living with the condition with murderers , and suggesting there is no place for them in his vision of @entity3 , mr @entity0 has stooped to a new level of ignorance			1
he should be truly ashamed			0
’ but mr @entity0 defended the remarks , originally published in the magazine @entity65			1
he told @entity67 's today programme the @entity3 's public services could not cope with extra demand created by people with severe medical conditions coming to @entity3			1
he said : ‘ we want people to come who have got trades and skills , but we do n't want people who have got criminal records - and we ca n't afford people with life - threatening diseases			2
‘ i do not think people with life - threatening diseases should be treated by our @entity82 and that is an absolute essential condition for working out a proper immigration policy			0
‘ we have leading cancer experts in @entity3 saying the burden now of treating overseas people is leading to huge shortages in the system			1
’ he added the @entity3 should follow similar bans he said were in place in the @entity93 and @entity40			1
about 40 per cent of new @entity8 diagnoses in 2013 were of people born outside the @entity3 , according to @entity96			1
@entity99 defector and @entity5 candidate for the parliamentary seat of @entity101 and @entity102 , @entity103 , said he did not believe there should be a blanket ban on people with @entity8 entering the country			1
he added he believed the mr @entity0 's comments , as reported by @entity65 , were misleading			1
in the film ' @entity22 ' actor @entity109 plays the brutal @entity20 dictator @entity111 set in @entity20 the film features @entity113 ( left ) as ' dr @entity21 ' - inspired by mr @entity11 's father @entity17 who diagnosed the first confirmed cases of @entity19 in @entity20 dr @entity17 - @entity11 's father - was the inspiration behind the character of the @entity121 doctor in the film ' @entity22 ' a patient from overseas suffering from @entity8 is entitled to lifelong treatment on the @entity82			1
thanks to a change in policy , an hiv - positive migrant could go and see their gp complaining of something as innocuous as a cold – and end up costing the @entity82 hundreds of thousands of pounds			0
this is because in a bid to prevent the spread of the disease , the coalition in 2012 decided to treat all foreigners with @entity8 , even if their cases were not emergencies			1
the @entity82 now offers expensive £ 20,000 - a - year antiretroviral drugs to all @entity143 residents in @entity144 with the disease , including failed asylum seekers and students on temporary visas			2
the average lifetime treatment cost for an hiv - positive person runs to hundreds of thousands of pounds			0
and once here , if a migrant or asylum seeker has @entity8 or @entity19 , it is hard to remove them			1
this is because failed asylum seekers from countries with poor medical systems can claim that sending them back would condemn them to die and so fight removal on the grounds that it would be a breach of their human rights			0
it is not known how many patients are affected or how much the policy has cost the @entity82 in total			0
but doctors have warned that the cost to the @entity82 of ‘ health tourism ’ could be billions of pounds			0
in his interview with @entity65 mr @entity0 is quoted as saying immigrants from outside @entity174 are ‘ discriminated against because we have an open door into @entity174 today ’			1
mr @entity0 added : ‘ if you 're an @entity178 engineer , say , your chances of admission are limited			1
@entity5 want to control the quantity and quality of people who come			0
’ the @entity5 leader then went on to define what he meant by ‘ quality ’			0
that @entity189 convicted murderer should n't have been allowed here			2
yes and people who do not have @entity8 , to be frank			2
that 's a good start			0
and people with a skill			0
’ ‘ what are those words inscribed under the @entity195 ? ' give me your tired , your poor , your huddled masses			0
' what you 're saying is : ' bring me your electricians , your merchant bankers and your guys without @entity8 '			2
’ ‘ there are 190 countries in the world , ’ mr @entity0 added , ‘ that operate like that ’			2
a caller to mr @entity0 ’s phone - in show on @entity208 called @entity209 told mr @entity0 that he was ‘ ramping up the fear makes people hide ’ and accuses him of ‘ playing the race card ’			1
she said she was not a ‘ drain on the health service ’ just because she has @entity8			2
but mr @entity0 said : ‘ if we turn the national health service , and the clue is in the name , if we change it to the global health service , we are going to have a serious problem with resources			2
’ in the interview with @entity65 , published today , mr @entity0 said it was wrong that the ‘ chances of admission ’ of highly qualified engineers from @entity178 were limited			2
‘ @entity5 want to control the quantity and quality of people who come , ’ he said			0
referring to convicted killer @entity231 , who is suspected of murdering @entity233 schoolgirl @entity232 , he added : ‘ it ’s simple			0
that @entity189 convicted murderer should n’t have been allowed here			0
’ asked whether ‘ quality ’ meant people without a homicide conviction , he answered : ‘ yes			0
and people who do not have @entity8 , to be frank			2
that ’s a good start			0
and people with a skill			0
that is what @entity3 should do			2
’ he went on to say : ‘ i have never said that we should not take refugees			0
we have a proud record of accepting refugees , and that must be continued			0
’ nearly 20 @entity248 backed an unsuccessful amendment to the government ’s @entity250 earlier this year – which would have required anyone coming to settle in @entity3 to prove that they were not @entity8 positive or carrying @entity254 in 2010 , @entity255 overturned a 20 - year - old @entity93 travel and immigration ban against people with @entity8			1
currently around 60 countries bar the entry of hiv - positive people , according to the @entity262			0
the list includes the @entity264 , the @entity265 , @entity266 , @entity267 , @entity268 , @entity269 , @entity270 , @entity271 , @entity272 , @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity275 , the @entity276 and @entity277 .			0
