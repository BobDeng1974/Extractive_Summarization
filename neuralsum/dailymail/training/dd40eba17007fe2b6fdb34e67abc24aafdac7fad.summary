weather warning : @entity22 collects sand bags to protect his home from possible flooding in @entity26 , @entity4 , on monday , december 1 , 2014 any delight over the prospect of beneficial precipitation was tempered by concerns about the threat of debris flows from the many areas of @entity4 where wildfires have burned away vegetation that would keep soil stable			1
a weak storm sunday was enough to block @entity38 west of @entity39 with a flow of mud from a section of the steep @entity43 denuded by a 44 - square - mile fire last year			2
the muck was cleared but debris basins that overflowed were still full and will keep the highway from reopening anytime soon			2

back - to - back storms are helping some cities in northwest @entity4 reach normal rainfall amounts for the year , or even better , but the reservoirs and @entity110 snowpack that provide much of the state 's water remain far short of what they should be , after three years of intense drought			2
