by @entity0 published : 17:10 est , 16 october 2013 updated : 20:33 est , 16 october 2013 well , what do we have here , staring at me from the bathroom mirror ? is that a frown line i see ? i think it is , quite a deep one , and there are crow 's feet too , two sets , fanning out below my eyes , not quite joining but certainly creeping their way towards the creases coursing from my nose to my mouth			1
i should n't be surprised			2
after all , what woman reaches the age of 62 without time carving its initials and experiences into her face ? but for me this is all new because , for best part of two decades , i 've been shielded from the effects of ageing , as i have worshipped every six months at the shrine of my beloved @entity29			1
we go back a long , long , way - dear old @entity29 and me			2
i was a @entity29 guinea pig , one of the first people to try the controversial injection in the @entity34 for cosmetic purposes , and i 've been hooked for two decades			2
going natural : @entity0 aged 60 , left , just before giving up @entity29 and aged 62 , right , after two years without it the joy of having smooth skin and wrinkles without having to undergo a @entity42 wind - tunnel style facelift was fantastic			1
i thought i 'd found the holy grail of anti-ageing and swore to use it for the rest of my life			1
but as my 60th birthday loomed , my letter reminding me to book my @entity50 appointment arrived , i hesitated before ringing			2
why ? @entity29 may be brilliant at halting the march of time , but it ca n't hold back inflation : when i first had the treatment , back in 1993 , it was £ 200			1
now it 's closer to £ 400			1
it 's still cheaper than a facelift but when you 've had it as often as me , only just			1
but my hesitation was n't just down to money			2
not only have i grown older , i 've finally grown up			2
as a 40 - year - old surveying my first wrinkles with horror , i 'd always assumed that my need to conceal them would increase over the passing years			1
but i 've actually discovered the opposite			2
i found myself staring in the mirror and wondered for the first time why i was continuing to use @entity29			1
it 's not as if i 'm a newsreader , competing with ever younger auto - cuties			1
when i walk past building sites , workmen no longer whistle - with or without @entity29			2
and my husband loves me both with and without make - up - he can rarely tell the difference			2
halting march of time : @entity0 ten years ago when she was a @entity29 devotee i 've realised it ’s finally time to stop worrying about looking ten years younger and accept that , with a decent frock , a slick of lipstick and a pair of heels , i still scrub up pretty well			1
i 'm actually using less make - up , and ask what 's wrong with looking like an attractive , well - preserved 62 - year - old woman when that 's exactly what i am ? i confess , however , i did recently have that horrible experience of glancing in a shop window and not recognising the old dear staring back at me			1
but surely it 's far worse to be one of those deluded women who are so used to their scary , frozen faces that they do n't notice themselves slipping into the ' weird and slightly deformed ' category			1
and , to add insult to injury , they no longer look any younger than their contemporaries			1
@entity105 recently admitted she stopped using @entity29 for that very reason , because it stopped making her look youthful			1
@entity107 gave it up because she said , at 66 , it was simply undignified			2
and i could n't agree more			0
as i approach 63 , i 'm finally starting to feel happy in my own , wrinkled skin			0
i do n't want to compete any more , or feel the need to fake my looks			0
and besides which , we still do n't really know what the health risks of @entity29 are over long - term , regular use			0
among younger women the popularity of @entity29 marches on , unchecked : in a recent survey , cosmetic surgeons reported an 18 per cent increase in demand for injections - especially among women their 30s and 40s			1
in a recent survey , cosmetic surgeons reported an 18 per cent increase in demand for injections - especially among women their 30s and 40s this very website reported the rise of the ' mummy makeover ' - the stampede of school mums to cosmetic clinics before the start of term to make sure they look as young and smooth as the other mothers at the schoolgates			0
and i do sympathise with them			0
i was in my late 30s , with young , school - age children , when that deep furrow first appeared between my eyebrows			0
my husband kept asking me what was wrong and workmen would shout : ' cheer up love , it may never happen			0
' @entity151 said i seemed permanently stressed			0
even though i felt fine , i really did look like mrs angry all the time			1
but what could i do ? then something wonderful happened			0
i was sent to interview a @entity50 cosmetic surgeon about a drug that was brand new to the @entity34			0
i read , fascinated , about this thing called @entity29 which had been injected into patients with involuntary facial tics and spasms			0
quitters : @entity105 , left , said she 's given up on @entity29 as it has stopped making her look younger while @entity107 gave it up because she said , at 66 , it was simply undignified i learned how it was discovered that one of the side - effects of paralysing the over-active , twitching muscles was that the patient 's wrinkles vanished too			1
how fantastic , i thought			0
i pointed out my frown line ( which hardly needed pointing out ) to the surgeon and asked if i could try it			0
i was slightly perturbed at the thought of having a drug injected into me that was derived from poisonous botulism bacteria , however diluted and mild , but the effects were miraculous			0
my horrid little furrow vanished , along with some forehead lines , and my brow seemed to have lifted , leaving me looking wide eyed and fresh - as if i ’d just come back from a long holiday			0
the surgeon warned me that it was n't permanent and i 'd need regular treatments			0
to me , it was a tiny price to pay for looking and feeling so great , even though i am a bit of a coward and the injections stung , despite liberal amounts of anaesthetic cream			0
now i 'm happy to display my battle scars , and i 'll be saving myself a great deal of time and money in the process over the years , i kept up my regular appointments			1
those little jabs took me through the highs and lows and stresses of life that cause your skin to sag and plough deep worry lines			1
i think i even dealt with life a bit better because of them - knowing i looked good made me feel more confident and more in control of everything			0
and of course , i was n't the only one to catch on to the benefits of @entity29			0
the news of this miraculous little treatment spread like wildfire , and this was in the days before the internet			1
the genie was out of the bottle and anyone who was anyone had to have it			0
there were @entity29 parties in private homes where women sat chatting with layers of anaesthetic cream or post-injection ice packs on their foreheads as the cheese dip and @entity230 were passed round			0
in demand : but we still do n't really know what the health risks of @entity29 are over long - term , regular use celebrities seemed addicted to it , and the immobile faces of @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 and @entity243 peered out at us from magazines and tv			0
age of the jab when @entity29 was first introduced as an anti-ageing treatment , the average age of the user was 41 and where previously it had been de rigueur to flatly deny any helping hand you 'd had with your looks , @entity29 was so cool , a-listers were actually admitting they ’d had it			1
and still the party continues			0
@entity29 has just had its 25th @entity34 anniversary and is still the top anti-ageing product , even among the ever - growing range of miracle creams , fillers and bizarre freezing treatments			1
@entity29 and i have parted company for good			0
it 's been two years since my last jab and new lines are appearing every day			1
i 've even got lines on my lines ! but the difference is that now i 'm happy to display my battle scars , and i 'll be saving myself a great deal of time and money in the process			2
i 've had all the ups and downs of marriage , two children and a career - and i ’m not afraid to show it			0
sometimes when i see my two daughters scowling i do n't just give them my own mother 's folklore waffle - the wind will change and your face will stay like that - i simply say stop frowning or start saving for your @entity29			1
but for me it 's bye bye botox			2
it 's been great , but now i 'm happy to frown .			2

@entity0 started having the anti-ageing jabs 20 years ago
but the cost of treatment has gone up making it an *expensive* habit
she 's also realised it 's time to stop worrying about trying to look younger
