by @entity0 fish and chip shops have been told to check their stock for shark meat after the gruesome discovery of scores of carcasses on the @entity7			1
a resident of the island was left horrified after stumbling across a mound of severed heads and fins of smooth - hound sharks , which are completely harmless to humans			1
after a picture of his shocking find appeared on @entity19 , government officials have urged chip shops to ensure they know what they are selling			1
@entity7 resident @entity22 took this picture after discovering more than 50 carcasses near @entity25 conservationists have called for catch limits on the amount of small - hound sharks that can be landed shark meat is often used in pet food and fish meal but can also be passed off as huss or rock salmon , which are sold in takeaways around @entity36			1
it is thought an unlicensed trawler may have landed the sharks , before their valueless heads and fins were cut off , leaving only the meat			1
@entity22 , who found the remains of what he estimates at more than 50 of the animals , said local residents had been shocked by what had been found			2
he told @entity48 : ' i 'm a fisherman myself but everyone i know throws them back alive when they catch them because they are of no real value and are falling in numbers			2
i think it must have been someone doing it illegally			2
smooth - hound sharks are found throughout the eastern @entity61			2
while they can grow to 200cm in size , they are usually around 150cm long			0
despite being related to more ferocious creatures , smooth - hounds rarely even attack other fish and live off crabs and shellfish found on the sea - bed			2
rather than the typical razor - sharp teeth associated with their relations , the smooth - hound has much blunter crushing plates which are adapted to help them eat the crustaceans which make up the majority of their diet			0
smooth - hound are generally caught on a strict ' catch - and - release ' basis by @entity36 anglers and killing one , according to one fishing website , is ' simply not the done thing '			1
after being classed as ' vulnerable ' , the common smooth - hound 's plight has recently been compared to the polar bear by marine biologists			1
' i was disgusted to see them all just discarded like that and everyone around here is really angry about it			0
it was especially sad to see that many of those killed were just young pups			0
how are they supposed to breed if even the young ones are being killed ? ' the @entity103 , which monitors the quality of food in restaurants and shops , has since issued guidance to anyone selling fish			1
a spokesman said : ' fish must be what it claims to be on the label or the menu and food businesses must make sure they buy their fish from reputable sources			2
' conservationists are also concerned because the smooth - hound species has been classified as ' vulnerable ' by the @entity122			1
@entity123 , chairman of the @entity124 , warned that fishing for sharks is becoming increasingly common in @entity36 waters			1
after viewing a photo of the latest find , he said : ' i 'm always disappointed at the waste of vulnerable or endangered species			1
' he called for limits on how many sharks fisherman can land in a bid to stop the rising numbers being caught			0
holidaymakers find dozens of dead sharks washed up on @entity36 beach after being scooped up by trawler then dumped marine experts have been left outraged after 70 dead sharks were found washed up on a @entity36 beach			1
the ' perfectly healthy ' sharks are thought to have been scooped up by a trawler then illegally dumped over the side			0
the dead smooth - hounds and catsharks were found by holidaymakers on a remote beach on the @entity152 coastline of @entity153			0
it is thought the creatures were caught by a fishing trawler before being dumped over the side of the boat marine biologist @entity159 blamed ' indiscriminate bottom trawling ' for the grim find			0
she said : ' it was horrific - i wandered along the beach in total disbelief			0
there were several varieties of small shark lying dead on the sand and over the rocks			2
' i counted 55 but there were a lot more - i have never seen such a terrible sight here in @entity36			1
there are always grim reminders of why i am so passionate about marine wildlife and protecting it			0
' mrs @entity159 believes the sharks are victims of industrial scale bottom trawling - where boats use a large net with heavy weights to drag the seafloor and scoop up everything in its path			0
she thinks the sharks were caught in the nets but then dumped back into the sea because they have no commercial value			0
the dead sharks were found at @entity193 near @entity194 but it is feared hundreds more may have been washed up on nearby rocks and inaccessible beaches			0
the animals have little commercial value and a marine biologist thinks they were victims of ' industrial trawling '			0
