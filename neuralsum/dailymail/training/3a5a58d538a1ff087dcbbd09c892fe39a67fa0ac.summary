across the world , life expectancy is steadily increasing and , on average a woman aged 60 today can expect to live until she is 82			1
for men , this is 79			0
but the quality of life for this ageing population varies drastically from country to country			2

at the opposite end of the scale is @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity32 and @entity33			2
the @entity19 is in 8th place , the @entity18 is in 11th and @entity21 is in 13th that ’s according to findings from the 2014 @entity23			1
it ranks 96 nations on the basis of the quality of life and social and economic status of older people , aged 60 and over			1
the index studies four areas , in particular			2
@entity44 covers the state of pensions , relative welfare of older people , gdp in each country , and poverty rate in old age			0
health status includes life expectancy at 60 and psychological status			1
capability covers the employment level and educational status of older people , and ‘ enabling environment ’ includes physical safety , social connections and access to public transport			1
from this index , governments can use the findings to identify policies to improve the lives of their older people			0

the @entity18 ranked 11th overall , and 3rd for the enabling environment , but scored poorly for health , at 27th			2
globally , by 2050 , the report claims the number of over 60s will be 21 per cent of the global population			1
this is almost double the current figure of 12 per cent			2
apart from @entity78 , the top ten countries are in @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81			0
@entity82 and @entity83 join the top 20			0
the older populations of the three lowest - ranked countries , the @entity32 and @entity33 , ( 94 ) @entity17 ( 95 ) and @entity16 ( 96 ) , still account for less than five per cent of the total population			1
the proportion of over- 80s is growing fastest , too – projected to rise from two per cent now to four per cent of the global population by 2050			1
and more than a third of countries are falling significantly behind those at the top of the @entity23			0

‘ @entity131 points to a mismatch between advances in longevity and a lag in the evolution of policies that empower older people , ’ said professor @entity124			0
‘ societies have been slow to embrace the positive aspects of longevity and to see older people as a resource that , in the right circumstances , can repay investment with extended working careers as well as more self - reliant , healthy and independent living			0
’ the report also highlights the disparity between those nations at the top of the index , and those in the lower third			0
for example , on income security , 26 countries scored less than half the top values set by @entity13 and @entity156 ( 89.1 and 88.0 respectively )			2
@entity157 , chief executive of @entity129 , added : ‘ the unprecedented rate and speed of population ageing presents policy - makers with a challenge			0
