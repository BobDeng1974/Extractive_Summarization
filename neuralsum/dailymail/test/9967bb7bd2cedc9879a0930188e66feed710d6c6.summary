@entity0 admits he is concerned @entity2 ’s confidence is plummeting after his struggles with @entity4 this week			1
the @entity6 manager will have a heart - to - heart chat with the forward ahead of saturday ’s crunch top - four clash against @entity13			1
@entity2 was hauled off after 55 minutes of @entity4 ’s 1 - 1 draw in @entity15 on tuesday night			1
@entity2 struggled for @entity4 and @entity0 admits he is concerned by the winger 's confidence @entity2 was replaced by @entity18 after just 55 minutes of @entity4 's 1 - 1 draw against @entity15 on tuesday 2 - @entity21 goals for @entity2 this season - his average haul per season during his time at @entity6 is 5.6			1
it was the latest disappointment in a difficult season for the 26 - year - old , who has struggled for game time since returning from a long - term lay - off due to a serious knee injury			2
with @entity31 out of @entity13 ’s visit due to a hamstring strain , and @entity34 a major doubt after sustaining a knee problem on international duty , @entity2 could start on saturday			1
but @entity0 said : ‘ yes , i ’m worried about @entity2 ’s confidence			1
he ’s sensitive and i ’m a bit concerned about the damage that game can have on his mind			2
@entity2 could face @entity13 on saturday with @entity31 injured and @entity34 a doubt ‘ he ’s not completely there yet ( after the injury )			1
but being exposed like that , people have a harsh judgement on him that is not deserved because he does well			2
‘ at the moment he is frustrated , but that is normal			2
i will speak with him , but i think he is strong enough			2
‘ i will see what state of mind he is in			0
we always have a word , if it is a positive experience or a negative experience , you ask “ how did it go ? ”			0
we always speak about the last game			0
‘ he is not fragile mentally , he is strong mentally but he is disappointed because when you come back from an injury you always think you are ready			0
he is at the moment not in his best mood			0
‘ he has big confidence in himself and he has gone through some difficult periods in his life and he has always come out with strength			2
’ @entity6 boss @entity0 says he will speak with @entity67 but believes the @entity69 winger is ' strong enough ' @entity2 found himself playing in the no 10 role for @entity4 in @entity71 — a role he is not accustomed to			1
and @entity0 admitted he was surprised to see the pacy forward in such an unfamiliar position			1
‘ have i ever seen him play no 10 in training or anything ? no , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ @entity2 ’s strength is the quality of his movements , he wants to go to get on the end of things			1
he ’s not a guy who provides			0
‘ i do n’t think it was the intention of @entity85 to play him there			0
it ’s maybe because @entity88 took the initiative during the game to play higher up and tell @entity2 to drop back			1
‘ i did n’t see @entity85 in the game stand up to say “ @entity2 , you come and play in midfield and @entity88 you go up front ”			1
that ’s an initiative they took on the pitch			0
’ @entity2 aims a shot at goal during @entity4 's friendly against @entity15 at the @entity100 in @entity71 @entity2 was starting his first international game in 18 months having injured his cruciate ligaments meanwhile , @entity0 insists there are fundamental flaws in @entity107 chairman @entity106 ’s proposal to increase the number of required homegrown players in @entity21 squads to 12			1
@entity106 believes increasing the number of @entity113 players in squads will help contribute to a more successful @entity4 team			1
but @entity0 said : ‘ i believe we are in a top level competition and you earn your right through the quality of your performance rather than your place of birth			1
‘ secondly , i ’m happy to , and would like to contribute to the quality of the @entity126 national team , but you have two questions you can raise before that			0
‘ first of all between 1966 and 1996 there were no foreign players in @entity4 and it did n’t improve too much the performances of the national team			2
‘ secondly , if between the ages of 16 and 21 the @entity4 youth teams win every single competition in @entity136 then there is something we have to do because they are not getting their chance at the top level			2
@entity0 believes there are flaws in @entity107 chairman @entity106 ’s proposal to increase the homegrown quota ‘ that is not the case , on the contrary			2
i think between 16 and 21 the @entity126 youth teams , until now , have not performed			0
so that ’s the heart of the problem			0
‘ let ’s get better at that level , then if there is a problem integrating these players in the top teams , we have to do something about it			0
‘ i think today you have to be very brave to integrate young players in the top teams because the pressure is very high			0
i still believe when they are good enough , they play			0
‘ you speak about @entity166 and @entity167			0
nobody stops the quality , no matter where they are from			0
so let ’s focus on that first			0
