by @entity0 published : 09:13 est , 1 march 2013 updated : 13:00 est , 1 march 2013 a man has become infected by a smallpox - like virus after coming into close contact with someone who had been recently vaccinated against the deadly disease			1
the infected 24 - year - old from @entity8 then passed the virus on to another man through sexual activity - a phenomenon known as tertiary transmission			0
although smallpox has been eradicated across the world , members of the @entity16 military are vaccinated against it before being deployed , due to fears of bio-terrorism			1
the vaccinia virus ( pictured ) causes cowpox , which produces skin lesions in people			0
the condition is related to smallpox they are injected with the vaccinia virus , which is a related form of the disease			1
but rather than being administered with a hypodermic needle , it is given using a two - pronged needle dipped into the vaccine solution			0
because it is a live virus , the injection site remains contagious for a few weeks and should remain covered			1
the open wound can easily transfer the vaccinia virus to other parts of the body or other people , so it is only safe to expose it once the scab that has formed over the injection site has fallen off			1
however , there have been more than 100 cases of transmission between vaccinated and unvaccinated people over the past decade			2
there have been reports of vaccination transmission through other forms of intimate contact , such as between mother and child and even at gyms			2
the vaccinia virus can not cause smallpox , but causes a rash and fever and can be deadly if passed on to someone with a compromised immune system			1
smallpox vaccines are administered using a two - pronged needle dipped the vaccine			2
the site must then be kept covered until the scab has fallen off in the latest case , the 24 - year - old man went to hospital complaining of a rash , with sores on his lips and genital area			1
he had been in sexual contact with a man who had received the smallpox vaccination			1
his condition cleared up without complications , according to a report from the @entity81			0
however , a second man was hospitalised after contracting the virus from sexual contact with the 24 - year - old			2
he too had sores caused by the vaccinia virus			0
he was treated with immune globulin intravenous , which boosts the body 's natural response in patients with compromised immune systems			1
after treatment , the patient was discharged and his condition also cleared up with no further complications			0
dr @entity96 , from @entity97 in @entity98 , said the virus the two men caught was a ' kissing cousin of smallpox '			0
' it can be transmitted if you are not careful , ' he added			0
the new report highlights the potential for the virus to be transmitted through sexual contact and reinforces the need to keep the vaccination wound covered , the agency said			0
the report was published in the march 1 issue of the @entity81 's @entity114 .			0

@entity16 military are vaccinated against smallpox before they are deployed *abroad*
can pass on related form of the disease via close contact if injection site is left uncovered
@entity124 causes rash and fever and can be deadly to those with compromised immune systems
