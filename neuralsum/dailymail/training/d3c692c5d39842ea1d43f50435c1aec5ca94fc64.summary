careful ! @entity0 stumbled as she arrived at the @entity10 for @entity2 auditions in @entity3 nervous ? @entity0 flashed a smile as she stepped out from her car but narrowly avoided a fall moments later she went on to greet fans outside the @entity16 and later joined her fellow judges @entity18 and @entity19 inside			0
there was a notable absence on the panel however - @entity23 missed the audition after coming down with bronchitis			1

@entity23 convinced bosses at the @entity40 that @entity41 was the best person for the job due to his vast experience on the @entity46 show and immediately arranged a £ 160,000 round - trip by private jet to cover for him at auditions today and tomorrow			1
@entity23 hopes to have recovered in time for the next auditions in @entity51 on june 16			2
happy : from the get go @entity41 was immediate hit with his fellow judges centre of attention : @entity0 is literally surrounded by fans as she enters the auditorium someone 's being naughty ! it looks like @entity18 is winding the girls up as @entity19 sticks her thumb down and @entity0 protrudes her bottom lip in jest last month , @entity0 sparked fears for her wellbeing as she dramatically walked out of filming			0
