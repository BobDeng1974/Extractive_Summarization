by @entity0 published : 10:40 est , 25 february 2014 @entity2 : 17:41 est , 25 february 2014 the mother of a sick teenage girl caught in a year - long , custody battle with doctors collapsed on monday after a judge decided the 15 - year - old should be placed in foster care and not returned to her family			1
the decision to prolong @entity13 's separation from her family caused her mother @entity14 to faint at the @entity16 courthouse			1
the 56 - year - old , who is diabetic , was stretchered out and taken to @entity18			1
speaking from her @entity21 home today , @entity19 told @entity22 that doctors said her blackout was caused by the high stress she has been suffering over her daughter 's ordeal , which the mother described as ' evil '			1
@entity13 was diagnosed with @entity48 , a rare genetic muscle - wasting illness , by @entity51 in 2011 and was undergoing a drug treatment program			1
however last year , while being treated for flu at @entity16 's @entity43 , experts said she had @entity55 , a stress - related mental illness where people ' imagine they are ill '			1
when the teen 's parents contested the hospital 's diagnosis and sought to have their daughter treated by her own doctor , officials reportedly refused and a short time later , the girl was taken into the custody of the state			2
the teenager was transferred to a residential psychiatric unit at the end of january 2013 and has remained there since			2
mrs @entity13 , who has three other daughters and cares for her 93 - year - old mother at @entity76 home , told @entity22 on tuesday : ' i have had no medical updates about my child			1
she is deteriorating - she ca n't stand , sit , she has chronic pain			2
' when i saw her on friday , her stomach was distended , she did n't feel well			2
' @entity83 @entity44 said in a statement : ' @entity85 does not comment or provide any information regarding children in our custody			0
additionally , the @entity90 has maintained a gag order in this case , prohibiting any parties from discussing the case or details surrounding it			0
' @entity97 residential unit in @entity98 where @entity99 is currently being held was unable to comment on specific cases			0
anguish : @entity13 's mother @entity14 and sister @entity33 are rushed to a waiting ambulance after the 56 - year - old collapsed following the judge 's ruling that her daughter will be kept in foster care happy : the family maintain that @entity34 was healthy and contented before she was admitted to hospital a year ago			1
they said she was a keen ice - skater and loved hiking with her dog @entity114 ( right ) the family is devastated that @entity34 is now scheduled to be moved from a residential center in @entity98 to @entity117 which is even further from the family 's home in @entity76 , @entity21 and makes it more difficult to visit			1
although the judge 's ruling is only temporary until the next court date on march 17 , it is another heartbreaking decision in an anguished year for the @entity13 family			1
a gag order also remains in place over the custody proceedings until that time			0
mrs @entity13 said on tuesday that she has no faith in the justice system since her daughter was taken from her family , calling the court hearings a ' joke '			1
however the mother - of - four said her family was now being helped by several lawyers and organizations			2
she said : ' i 'm so grateful , they have given me hope			0
i feel like @entity138 has finally listened			0
' fears : @entity42 and @entity14 say @entity34 ' is barely recognizable as her health has deteriorated so badly ' we miss you : sitting on @entity34 's bed at her @entity21 home are her sisters : from left , @entity146 , @entity33 and @entity147			2

there is no cure for the condition that is progressive and can be fatal			0
symptoms can include weakness , intolerance for exercise , heart failure , dementia and rhythm disturbances			0
each year , 1,000 - 4,000 children in the @entity173 are born with the disease			2
however last year doctors concluded miss @entity176 was suffering from @entity178 disorder , a psychological condition that causes sufferers to feel pain , although there is no physical cause for it			1
sufferers do not feign the physical symptoms they feel , rather they present themselves as the result of mental strain			1
doctors can not identify the sources of patients ' pain and instead prescribe anti-depressants			1
experts estimate that between 0.2 and 2 per cent of females and less than 0.2			0
per cent of men in the @entity173 suffer from the condition			0

it is a locked psychiatric unit full of children with major psychiatric problems			1

once a week she is taken on a three - hour round trip to see doctors but that is it			2
' we are only allowed to see her for one hour a week at a @entity218 office			0
health aside , she is a mess			0
