a couple in @entity1 are facing up to a potential wedding day disaster on saturday because the intended venue for their nuptials was affected by the government shutdown			1
when @entity8 , 29 , and @entity9 , 30 , decided to marry they wanted to celebrate their union at the site of their first date - the west lawn of the @entity15			1
with their 130 guests already starting to fly in from all over the country for saturday ’s ceremony , they received an ominous e-mail from the @entity23 permit management office warning them on monday that their intended venue was in doubt pending last night ’s decision on @entity26			2
‘ shutdowns are one of those things that on an intellectual level you know are going to impact an average person , but you really do n’t get it until it hits you in a way like this , ’ @entity8 told the @entity42			0
‘ there are plenty of people around the country who may not understand that this is n’t just going to hurt nameless government workers and that , in a depressing way , it impacts your wedding plans with just a few days ’ notice			0
’ the couple are so nostalgic about their first date by the @entity15 three years ago that , in the run - up to their wedding , they had a professional photographer take pictures of them paddleboating by the memorial again			2
a woman views the @entity15 from behind barricades in @entity1 , on october 1 , 2013 following the government shut down at midnight @entity1 couple @entity8 and @entity76 have admitted they briefly contemplated crashing their own wedding site - the @entity15 which has been closed as part of the government shutdown ' this is a very meaningful site to me , ' cassesso			1
a couple of weeks ago , when they began pondering how a shutdown might impact their nuptials , @entity8 and @entity9 never thought that the wedding site would be off - limits			1
‘ we just thought there ’d be leaves on the ground , that there ’d be no maintenance , no rangers or @entity97 , ’ @entity8 said			0
they couple even briefly contemplated crashing their own wedding site , but their thoughts quickly turned to finding an alternative venue			2
unfortunately finding a venue for 130 guests is n’t an easy task at short notice and the couple quickly determined that they had two options – to either marry at their reception venue , the @entity114 and @entity115 on @entity26 ; or use the backyard of their apartment building			1
unless the government shutdown is resolved by 5.30pm on saturday then @entity8 and @entity9 will get married at the @entity114 and @entity115 on @entity26 , the venue for their reception although @entity8 was keen to go with their backyard because they ’d already spent $ 700 to rent chairs , his bride put her foot down because the yard is also home to a dumpster			1
‘ i do n’t want there to be a dumpster			0
it ’ll smell , ’ said @entity9			0
the couple are one of two dozen october weddings on the @entity137 endangered by the federal shutdown			0
nationwide more than 400 parks are impacted by the shutdown , but a spokeswoman for the @entity142 said it does n’t have a tally for the number of weddings scheduled .			0
