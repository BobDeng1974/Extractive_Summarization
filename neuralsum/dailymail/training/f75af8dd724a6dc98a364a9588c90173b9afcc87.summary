harlequins stay top of @entity2 despite this narrow defeat but have @entity4 for company now after this thrilling battle in a freezing @entity7			1
@entity8 and @entity9 inspired a stirring second - half fightback from @entity0 , who came from 11 - 3 down to lead 13 - 11 with little over 10 minutes to play			1
an @entity13 penalty proved decisive in the end , with the match marred by a late punch - up and a somewhat strange yellow card for @entity18 , for bringing his hand close to the eyes of @entity21 during the scuffle , despite officials saying they were not sure he was eye - gouging			2
@entity4 scrum half @entity25 dives over for the home side 's opening try at @entity29 @entity0 and @entity32 number nine @entity9 eyes up a gap during a tight first half in @entity7 @entity4 inside centre @entity13 fires out a pass as @entity0 centre @entity37 looks to make a tackle @entity0 host wasps in round five in january and a win there will take them close to the knockout stages , since their final pool match is against hapless @entity47			1
they will rue a disallowed try and six points spurned by rookie kicker @entity51			0
making only his fifth senior appearance for @entity0 , @entity51 badly mishit a second - minute penalty			0
that brought the first roars from @entity4 supporters but the visitors steamed into the contest			0
@entity0 took two quick lineouts inside the first five minutes , determined to keep the ball in play and run the legs off the three - time champions on their home pitch			2
@entity0 full back @entity8 makes a strong carry into the @entity4 defence @entity13 eventually kicked @entity4 in front after 25 minutes but they kept applying pressure like a tourniquet and were rewarded with a try — only their fourth in @entity72 this season – when @entity25 slid over in the 32nd minute			1
a quick pick - up from @entity75 off an attacking scrum close to the @entity0 line allowed him to pop a pass to @entity25 , who had an unimpeded dart to the line			1
@entity13 missed the conversion but , within two minutes , @entity51 spurned another easy chance to open the @entity0 account			1
having to start without former @entity85 @entity84 in the no 10 shirt looked as damaging as losing @entity87 given their team - mates ’ failure to string together coherent attacks in the first half			0
@entity4 lock @entity92 is stopped in his tracks by the twin tackle of @entity95 ( left ) and @entity96 in @entity9 and @entity8 , though , @entity97 had two proven test - quality backs in his arsenal and they combined for a marvellous try two minutes after the restart , @entity9 ’s delicate chip behind the @entity4 defence caught by the on - rushing @entity8			2
but incredibly , referee @entity104 judged that @entity0 had knocked on earlier in the move , despite video evidence suggesting the ball had been touched by a @entity4 hand			2
@entity0 refused to feel downhearted and won a thumping scrum penalty in the 46th minute , with @entity51 finally landing a kick at goal			0
@entity0 veteran @entity112 carries into the @entity4 defence as @entity114 ( right ) watches on @entity0 minced their opponents with two huge scrums and from the second they won a penalty to set in train the move that ended with a legitimate @entity8 try , with @entity51 converting			1
the @entity4 cause was further weakened by a silly penalty given away by @entity4 lock @entity92 for tackling @entity123 without the ball			0
@entity51 swept over the line to score and put his team ahead with 15 minutes remaining			0
@entity4 survived a 25 - metre scrum in the 70th minute and broke quickly forward , the attack ending with @entity0 going offside and a penalty scored by @entity13 to nose @entity4 back ahead			1
then came the scuffle but , more importantly , @entity4 won the penalty and somehow held on .			0

@entity13 kicks three crucial penalties for @entity4
@entity25 score the home side 's only try
@entity8 *replied* with a try for @entity0
quins remain top of @entity142 ahead of @entity4 on points *differnce*
