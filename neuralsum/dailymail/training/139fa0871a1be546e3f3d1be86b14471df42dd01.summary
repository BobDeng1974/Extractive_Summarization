when you first see @entity3 @entity2 's ' evidence ' of life on the @entity5 , all you can see is a mass of rocks			1
but as the camera zooms in and then pulls back , you can not help but make out the form of a little green man scuttling forward to pick up what appears to be an iconic @entity14 boot lying on the dusty floor			0
the video is the latest in a long line of curious and quirky images from the @entity5 that internet users have jumped to interpret			1
in the early days , the planet was throwing up curiosities			0
in the 1800s , earthbound observers were certain they could see canals - and even cities - through their telescopes			2
but as we became better with our optics , so did our understanding of @entity5 , and this belief was put to bed as newer images showed no trace of life			1
then , in 1976 , @entity5 was back with a new mystery - the famous face on @entity5 , taken by the @entity56 1 during a flyby in 1976			1
this was later shown to be just another light and perspective trick by @entity5 , but the haunting visage captured the world 's attention			2
more recently , @entity67 user @entity65 , part of @entity69 , has been gazing at the latest images from the @entity71 , and has collected a fine collection of oddities			1
these include white ' flying objects ' zooming across the @entity5 sky - and then a collection of mysterious ' items ' he spotted in a video from @entity82			2
the image shows what appears to be a rock shaped like a digit with a faint outline at one end that vaguely resembles a fingernail			0
another rock found nearby resembles an overturned sandal , and a crevice on another geological formation looks like a smiling @entity5 critter			0
he announced : ' @entity71 captures a possible ancient finger , a dome shaped object , a shoe or sandal and a possible @entity5 creature			2
' are these anomalies real , tricks of the light or something else , as always you decide			0
' ancient digit : from the face on @entity5 , captured by @entity36 in 1976 , to the ' finger ' found just last week , @entity5 likes to tease us with suggestions of life @entity5 footwear : another rock that caught the attention of the @entity117 enthusiast made him think of a long - forgotten shoe or sandal on the surface of the @entity5 martian life form : an image of a rock with a crevice in the middle vaguely resembles a grinning extra-terrestrial critter incredible : @entity36 's @entity71 shows the base of @entity130 , the rover 's eventual science destination , in its latest image release @entity117 or camera snafu : the same relentless web user posted footage in which he applied a series of filters to a @entity71 image , revealing what he claimed to be four objects resembling flying saucers theory debunked : experts came out saying that the four ' saucers ' are actually just dead pixels in the rover 's camera the @entity67 video - posted by a @entity150 - puts the photograph through many different filters to try to find more clues as to their existence			1
a fourth blob can be seen to the top of this image two lights are seen on @entity5			0
first ( top ) , a light moves across the @entity5 horizon , and second ( bottom ) a small light rises from the surface of the planet video : is this an alien on @entity5 ?			0
