an elderly @entity3 woman has confessed to smothering her infant son in 1961 and may also be responsible for the deaths of her twin daughters in 1969 and 1970 , her surviving children say			1
@entity7 , 77 , recently admitted at her @entity9 retirement home that 8 - month - old @entity10 died at her hands and not of accidental asphyxiation as his death certificate reads , says her daughter @entity14 , 54			1
along with her brother @entity15 , who found @entity10 dead in his bed at age 4 and was blamed for the death , @entity14 firmly believes her mother also murdered her twin sisters @entity21 and @entity22 while they were still babies			1
shock confession : @entity14 ( left and right at right ) says her mother confessed to her to murdering her infant brother 53 years ago ' i asked if she had told anyone and she said she told my dad , ' @entity14 told the @entity29			1
' he just told her , " well i have n't been there for you and i guess life goes on			0
" ' @entity14 said she went to her mother to discuss the deaths of her twin sisters after her father was put in prison in september for sexually assaulting a friend 's child			1
when her mother said she was willing to talk , @entity14 assumed she 'd finally get to hear about the double murder -- or at the very least , willful neglect -- of her baby sisters			1
instead , she got a surprise confession -- her mother said she 'd killed her baby daughter @entity22 in 1969 and then her twin sister @entity21 just months later in 1970			1
@entity14 says she was blamed for @entity21 's death			2
' she was quiet and then she said his name , ' @entity14 told the @entity29 about the day her mother confessed			2
' i do n't know how i stayed calm			0
' after an initial denial , @entity10 told the @entity29 that she had , in fact , killed @entity10 all those years ago			2
' i did n't know what i was doing , ' she said			0
' all these years i had forgotten			0
i am going to die			0
i hate myself so much			0
i am ready to die			0
' getting closure ? baby @entity55 's cause of death on his 1961 death certificate was ' aspiration of regurgitated formula ' embattled : @entity61 says his mother blamed him when his baby brother died and he 's lived with the trauma , and that of being raised in a violent and alcoholic home , all his life the tiny box containing the body of @entity10 has been exhumed			1
it remained unclear , pending the results of an autopsy , whether or not @entity10 would be charged			1
no investigation had begun in the death of either twin			2
his mother 's confession was especially bittersweet for @entity61 , who was blamed for @entity10 's death at such a young age			1
' after she allegedly smothered the baby she put the baby in bed with me , ' said the 58 - year - old , who 's been in and out of therapy his whole life , branded as bipolar and even once suffered through a suicide attempt			2
' i was shy of 5 years old			0
i woke and he was dead			0
i picked him up and took him downstairs			0
she told me it was my fault			0
' both @entity15 and @entity14 recall their home being a violent one , where children were routinely beaten or even tossed down stairs			2
all of @entity7 's surviving children , even including younger @entity101 -- who has no memory of the events and was raised in a far less tempestuous environment after the parents ' turned to religion ' -- believe the twins died as a result of their mother 's actions or inactions			1
' my older brother and i have lived through hell , ' @entity14 said			0
' now to know so many things will be exposed , it is a relief for my siblings who are gone but in my heart have never ever , been forgotten			0
' getting answers : @entity14 asked her mother about the death of her siblings -- thinking she 'd get a response about her mother 's role in the twins ' deaths -- after her father @entity55 was sentenced to prison for sexually assaulting a friend 's child			1

the baby 's 1961 cause of death was listed as accidental *oxygen* *deprivation*
