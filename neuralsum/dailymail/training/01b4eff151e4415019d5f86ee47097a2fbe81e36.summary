by @entity0 published : 04:34 est , 28 january 2013 updated : 10:31 est , 28 january 2013 with racist and sexist graffiti scrawled all over the walls , you would find it hard to believe that this is a construction site at @entity6			1
@entity7 , built on the spot where 2,800 people died in the 9/11 attacks , is rife with ethnic slurs referring to @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 people written in black marker pen			2
the writings on the toilet walls throughout the 104 - story tower is believed to be the effort of builders working to finish construction this year			1
in honour : a photograph showing non-offensive graffiti and personal messages left by construction workers and visitors at the site of @entity7 , much unlike what can be found inside the tower many of the anonymous messages use the n - word and women are frequently targeted on the provisional plywood bathrooms located on every fifth floor of the 1,776ft tower			1
‘ lame n * * * * be queit ( sic ) , ’ reads one racist and misspelled remark recorded by the @entity40			0
‘ woman ( sic ) do n’t belong in construction ! maybe painting , that ’s it , ’ directed at female construction workers on the site , was replied to with : ‘ then who ’s gon na * * * * us ? ’ not only @entity12 and women are subjected to the offensive comments , with one worker demanding @entity13 people to ' take a bath ya smelly f * * * * ’			0
one urinal welcomes builders with ‘ none whites only ’ written in capitals , whilst another urinal is marked with the contrary ‘ whites only ’			0
disgrace : the offensive remarks were left on the walls of provisional toilets inside @entity7 , most written with black marker and believed to be the work of the builders on the site ‘ most of it ’s racial , ’ an insider told @entity69			1
‘ most of it - i mean , there ’s a lot of stuff with the n - word			0
but pretty much every race is covered : @entity80 people , @entity13 people , jewish people , women			0
’ the n - word , he added , ‘ is written all over the place , to be honest with you			0
that ’s a big deal			0
’ the inside source told the paper that although some of the writings on the wall are positive remarks , ’ 99 per cent ’ of the graffiti is insulting and vulgar			1
' we ’re all supposed to be there as one , the whole 9/11 thing ’ another worker told the newspaper			0
he said the graffiti ruins his sense of pride of working on the @entity7 , commonly known as @entity7 , saying it should not be on its walls			1
shocking scribbles : the walls inside @entity7 are rife with sexist remarks and racist slurs including attacks on @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 people @entity7 is at the heart of the complex to be built on the site of the two towers destroyed in the 9/11 terrorist attacks on @entity117 , @entity118			1
the $ 3.8 billion construction is part of the effort to memorize and rebuild the @entity7 , a promise made by then - president @entity123 shortly after the @entity125 - led attack in 2001			1
with its antenna reaching the symbolic height of 1,776ft to commemorate the signing of the @entity129 , @entity7 will become the tallest building in @entity131 upon its completion			2
the building itself , minus the antenna , will stand 1,368 feet tall , the height of the original @entity7 north tower where 1,526 people died , not including the 479 rescue workers who perished trying to save them			2
when president @entity142 visited the site in june last year he too scrawled on the construction , writing the inspiring and appropriate ‘ we remember			2
we come back stronger ! ’ on a steel beam .			0
