just as it seems as if you are on to a rare , not - so - bad monday morning , a colleague turns to you and asks : ' so , what did you get up to this weekend ? ' when asked this question , one in three @entity12 workers feel compelled to lie to make themselves seem more interesting , a new study has revealed			1
do n't even ask : one in three workers suffer from ' weekendvy ' , compelling them to lie to colleagues about what they got up to at the weekend ( picture posed by model ) a third of workers suffer from ' weekendvy ' - where they are economical with the truth so they appear as adventurous as their colleagues			1
