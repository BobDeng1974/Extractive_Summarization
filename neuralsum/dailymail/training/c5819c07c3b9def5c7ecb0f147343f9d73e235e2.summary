senior aircraftman @entity0 had previously bragged to colleagues about his ' party trick ' that allowed him to pull the trigger on a loaded pistol without the bullet being fired an @entity9 airman has been jailed after he shot a friend through the stomach whilst demonstrating a ' party trick ' with a high - powered weapon during a tour of @entity15			1
senior aircraftman @entity0 was in the back of a @entity18 armoured personnel carrier at @entity19 when he fired the @entity21 pistol			1
the 23 - year - old had previously bragged to shocked colleagues about a technique he had learned which allowed him to pull the trigger on a loaded pistol without the bullet being fired			1
but the stunt went horribly wrong when he shot a bullet through the stomach of fellow serviceman senior aircraftman @entity31			1
@entity0 was jailed for three years and was dismissed from her majesty 's service after being found guilty of malicious wounding by an @entity9 panel following two hours ' deliberation at @entity39			1
judge @entity40 said : ' in a service context it is fairly elementary to understand the reason you do not play around with firearms and point them at people			0
' that , on its own , is an example of recklessness but in this case it is far more serious			0
there is plainly a military imperative to spell out in the clearest terms that servicemen who play around with firearms will be punished			0
' we are of the view that the seriousness of this offence can only result in a custodial sentence			0
' @entity63 - based at @entity64 in @entity65 - was sat in the back of the @entity18 when he volunteered to demonstrate his ' party trick ' whilst pointing the pistol at 24 - year - old @entity70			1
just moments later , a single shot rang out , hitting @entity31 in his stomach with the bullet passing through his body and out of his back			1
despite his horrific injuries , @entity31 was initially reluctant to report the incident fearing @entity79 colleagues would ridicule the @entity9			1
he believed the cock - up would make the @entity9 look like ' twats ' because , in his own words , ' the @entity79 would love to hear we shot one of our own lads			1
' @entity0 denied a charge that he maliciously wounded @entity31 in the incident shortly before 10pm on december 4 , 2013			1
the serviceman had previously stumbled across a way of pulling back the top slide of the @entity21 pistol a short distance without a round entering the chamber			1
the trick , which he had successfully demonstrated to ' surprised and shocked ' colleagues on previous occasions , engaged the trigger therefore allowing the pistol to be fired without a shot coming out			1
lieutenant colonel @entity102 , prosecuting , told a court martial : ' the prosecution case is @entity105 got out of the driver 's seat where he was in the front of the vehicle and got into the back and his purpose in so doing was to discuss and ultimately demonstrate his party trick which was performed on his glock pistol			1
' the trick was performed with his loaded @entity21 pistol and involved him pulling back the cocked slide of a loaded weapon so that the trigger came forward but no round enters the chamber			1
' he told the court @entity0 had declared ' do you want to see my party trick ? ' lt col @entity102 said : ' @entity31 then saw the defendant cock the pistol by pulling back the slide and the pistol was pointed at him			1
' @entity31 told him not to point the weapon at him , at which point the defendant laughed			1
@entity31 told him not to pull the trigger , but he did , shooting @entity70 in his abdomen			1
' lt col @entity102 said @entity0 's actions went beyond mere negligent discharge			1
' he must have been aware of the obvious dangers of what he was doing , ' he added			0
@entity139 told the court of the fateful moment he was shot			2
he said : ' i was looking into my day sack and then i heard the @entity21 cock			0
i looked up and i saw he [ @entity0 ] was aiming it at my head			1
i asked him to stop pointing it			0
i told him i did not find it funny			0
i said stop messing around , stop pointing it at me			0
senior aircraftman @entity31 ( left ) said he asked @entity0 ( right ) to stop pointing the gun at him but was told to ' stop being a pussy ' ' i also said " you do n't know if there is anything in it " , but he said " i have done it loads of times mate , stop being a pussy "			1
' i said to him , " mate can you stop it , i do n't find it funny "			0
i started getting panicky and angry			0
he then lowered his aim from my head onto my torso			0
at the time i just carried on saying " can you stop pointing at me ? "			0
' he just laughed , he lowered his aim to my stomach and said " look , there is nothing in it "			2
he then shot me through my stomach and out of my back			1
' once i had been shot , he dropped the pistol and i said " oh my @entity175 , you have shot me "			2
he said " @entity175 , what have i done ? " he then got dragged off round the corner and i never saw him again			0
' the court heard how @entity70 was treated in hospital in @entity15 before being transferred back to @entity180 in @entity181 and then on to @entity183 rehabilitation centre in @entity184			2
he is still undergoing treatment for the injuries he suffered from the shot , has to wear a colostomy bag and has a 13 - inch scar running from his chest down to his stomach			1
he faces complex surgery in the future and has been warned his condition may leave him physically unable to remain in the @entity9			2
at first , he was not going to report the shooting for fear it would be amusing to their @entity79 counterparts			0
@entity0 was on his second tour of @entity15 when the incident occurred and had no previous convictions or disciplinary matters against him			2
@entity0 stood trial at @entity39 ( pictured ) after denying a charge that he had maliciously wounded @entity204 while showing off a ' party trick ' @entity0 - described as a ' lovely guy ' - had on an earlier occasion been told off by a senior officer as he was about to demonstrate his trick			1
his family has a long tradition in the @entity9 with both his grandfather and great grandfather serving their country in the @entity9			2
@entity216 , mitigating , revealed that since the incident @entity0 has continued to serve at @entity218 as part of its mountain rescue team			2
he added : ' it is accepted that the whole incident has been traumatic for @entity70			0
@entity224 wishes to apologise to @entity31 for the terrible mistake he made			2
there is nothing he would want to do more than rewind the clock back and undo what was done			0
he has had to live knowing he has caused these injuries to a fellow airman he worked alongside and liked			0
' this is someone who has made a serious mistake with serious consequences			0
he accepts for an offence like this a custodial sentence is inevitable			0
i ask you give him a sentence that recognises his good character and allows him to remain in the @entity9			2
' giving evidence , @entity0 admitted on a previous occasion he had carried out the ' trick ' whilst pointing a @entity21 at his own head			1
mr @entity216 said : ' do you remember doing that yourself ? ' @entity0 admitted he ' vaguely ' recalled the incident			2
he denied aiming his gun at @entity249 , saying he had only pointed it towards the rear of the mastiff personnel carrier			0
he said : ' i never purposely directed my weapon towards anyone			0
that is going to affect them and worry them			0
the incident occurred at @entity19 ( pictured ) , @entity15 , on december 4 , 2013			0
file image used ' i was demonstrating the procedure that i had carried out previously - when i fired , the round came out of the chamber and hit @entity70			0
' mr @entity216 asked : ' did you ever aim at @entity70 's head ? ' i did not , no sir , ' he replied			0
' did you think you were aiming at @entity70 's body or torso ? ' @entity0 replied : ' no sir , the weapon was generally aiming towards the back of the wagon			1
' @entity0 said before pulling the trigger , it did not appear that there was a round in the chamber			1
in the moments after the shooting he was heard to say , ' i ca n't believe i have done this			0
what have i done ? ' he admitted to the court he had been previously been spoken to by a senior officer who warned him not to carry out the trick but said it was just ' general chat ' rather than a disciplinary talk			2
@entity0 had previously admitted a lesser charge of negligence at an earlier hearing			2
he was found guilty following a three - day hearing			0
an @entity9 spokesman said : ' firstly our thoughts remain with the injured @entity9 serviceman who remains under medical care			1
' with regard to the court martial , the @entity9 takes weapons safety very seriously and can confirm that @entity300 ( @entity249 ) l @entity301 has been sentenced to three years ' imprisonment and discharge from the @entity9			1
' the @entity9 will now take the appropriate administrative action by initiating the discharge process			2
