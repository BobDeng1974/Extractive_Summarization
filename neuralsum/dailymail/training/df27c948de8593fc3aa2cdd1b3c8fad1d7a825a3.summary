@entity0 claims an independent @entity1 needs an extra 24,000 migrants @entity0 ’s independence blueprint aims to attract thousands more immigrants , who could use @entity1 as a back door to @entity6			1
the @entity7 say they would ’ celebrate ’ more people arriving from overseas , reversing what they claim is years of @entity10 ’			0
mr @entity0 says @entity1 needs an extra 24,000 immigrants a year to fill jobs and bankroll the welfare system for ageing @entity1 , but without tough border controls many could use it as an easy route into @entity6 and @entity17			1
data from the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) suggests that over the long term @entity1 can expect net migration of only 15,500 a year , on current trends			1
but mr @entity0 ’s target of 24,000 means he will have to attract an extra 9,500 - a - year , or 190,000 over two decades , by adopting different immigration rules to the rest of the @entity26			1
mr @entity0 has admitted the thousands of extra foreign workers are needed to fund the state pension in @entity1			1
the ratio between pensioners and workers is far worse in @entity1 than in the @entity26 as a whole , meaning the cost of funding pensions is borne by fewer people			1
@entity36 , the @entity7 ’s home affairs spokesman , wrote on the party 's website : ’ we plan a controlled points - based system to support the migration of skilled workers for the benefit of @entity1 ’s economy			1
’ an independent @entity1 will have an inclusive approach to citizenship and a humane approach to asylum seekers and refugees			2
’ he complained about ’ anti-immigrant rhetoric ’ and claimed @entity1 currently has to ’ lump inappropriate @entity55 immigration laws , and we are constantly told that they must become even more restrictive to protect us from the various ‘ floods ’ of ‘ foreigners ’ who are to erode our way of life ’			2
at @entity55 it could n’t make the politicians more miserable			0
’ the @entity7 hopes for an independent @entity70 to join @entity71 ( @entity71 ) which dates back to the 1920s and allows free movement between the @entity26 , @entity74 , the @entity75 and the @entity76			0
the official white paper for independence states : ' we plan to remain part of the @entity71 which means that there will be no border controls , and you will not need a passport to travel to other parts of the @entity26 , @entity74 , the @entity75 and the @entity76			2
' an illegal migrant tries to step into a truck going to the @entity26 in the @entity88 port of @entity89			0
@entity90 wants to see migration cut - but @entity0 insists @entity1 needs more labour from abroad an independent @entity1 operating an open border migration strategy would jeopardise an @entity6 government 's attempt to curb the number of migrants settling however , mr @entity0 also wants to have a more relaxed immigration policy than that adopted by @entity55 , raising the prospect of @entity1 being used as a back door route into the @entity26			1
the @entity7 plans to lower the current financial maintenance thresholds and minimum salary levels for entry to @entity1 , and to reintroduce a ' post-study work visa '			0
it means it would effectively have a more open immigration policy than the rest of the @entity26 , requiring controls at the border			0
the prime minister wants to see net migration cut to 100,000 a year - but is currently running at almost 250,000 the changes would take effect from 24 march 2016 when @entity1 would formally become an independent country			1
earlier this year @entity1 secretary @entity116 accused the @entity7 of having ' two fundamentally contradictory propositions '			2
' first of all they say we can be part of the @entity71 , which [ would be ] an open border between @entity1 and the rest of the @entity26 , and at the same time they say they will have a widely divergent immigration policy			2
' you can have either of these things , but you can not have them both			0
my challenge to the @entity132 is to explain which of these it is going to be			0
' mr @entity116 said the @entity7 's immigration proposals are ' radically different ' and would be ' incompatible ' with the @entity71			0
it means travellers heading south could be forced to pull over and undergo lengthy @entity89 - style identity checks on 21 roads that cross the border , including the @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142			0
rail passengers would also need to prove they had a right to enter the country before boarding a train leaving from @entity147 , @entity148 or @entity149 for @entity6 , in a similar time - consuming regime to @entity152 journeys from @entity88			0
a @entity55 analysis paper , launched in january , also revealed that lorries and vans could be inspected at the @entity6 border if @entity1 becomes independent amid fears of alcohol and tobacco smuggling			1
a spokesman for @entity70 said : ' existing @entity26 passports can continue to be used as normal until they expire			0
’ people will travel freely over the border between @entity1 and @entity6 just as they travel freely from @entity74 to @entity74			1

@entity0 wants a rise in net migration of 24,000 each year
it means an additional 9,000 annually above @entity19 *forecasts*
but he also wants to maintain open borders like @entity6 and @entity174
thousands of workers are needed in @entity1 to fund the state pension
poll reveals *700,000* @entity1 would consider moving south after independence
