this coat is £ 115 from @entity1 but just £ 89 from @entity2 trudging around the shops in winter can be miserable , so the popularity of catalogue and online shopping is no great surprise			1
however , if you compare the prices of some of the glossy brochures that thud through your letterbox , you could be in for a shock			2
a recent @entity1 catalogue featured a pretty pink coat for £ 115 and a lace - trimmed cardigan for £ 65			1
but the kaleidoscope catalogue had the same items at vastly reduced prices — £ 89 for the coat and £ 49 for the cardigan			1
the discrepancies do not stop there			0
a blue and black organza peplum dress that is £ 89 at @entity2 will cost you £ 115 through @entity1 , while patent leather @entity25 shoes are £ 45 and £ 59 respectively in these catalogues — though they ’re only £ 39.99 on the @entity25 website			1
what makes these discrepancies even more astonishing is the fact that @entity1 and @entity32 have the same parent company , @entity33			1
@entity34 , 67 , from @entity35 , @entity36 , has shopped with both catalogues			0
when she spotted the price differences , she wrote to the @entity39			1
‘ i ’d never noticed it before — it ’s only because the catalogues arrived on the same day , ’ she says			1
‘ i ’ve been shopping with them for ten or 12 years , so i am a bit cross			0
’ @entity46 company secretary @entity45 says : ‘ we vary our prices and terms and conditions across our brands			0
‘ if one of our customers shops with one of our brands and would like to apply for an account with another because they prefer that particular offer , they are always very welcome			0
‘ our prices are not based on where the customer lives			0
our internet and catalogue prices are nationwide			0
’ but , for @entity34 , that does n’t cut the mustard			0
‘ to charge extra on what they ’re making in the other catalogue is unfair , ’ she says			0
‘ everyone ’s money is tight these days			1
the last time i used the kaleidoscope catalogue was when my daughter was going to a wedding and wanted a posh dress			2
the stylish @entity77 dress from @entity78 , costs £ 85 on the brand ’s website			1
it ’s the same price at @entity82 , but if you buy the dress at @entity85 or @entity86 , it will cost you £ 108 ‘ the one she bought cost a lot of money , but now , i think that if i ’d looked at another catalogue , it might have been cheaper			1
i find it really annoying			0
’ other companies use similar pricing tactics online and in their catalogues			0
take the stylish @entity77 dress from @entity78 , which costs £ 85 on the brand ’s website			1
it ’s the same price at @entity82 , but if you buy the dress at @entity85 or @entity86 , it will cost you £ 108 — that ’s a hike of £ 23			1
however , all four companies are owned by @entity104			0
‘ @entity82 and @entity106 offer different propositions , and products are priced to reflect that difference , ’ says a spokesperson for @entity85			1
a @entity112 sequin and lace maxi dress is £ 95 at @entity114 and £ 99 at @entity115 ‘ the price that @entity106 customers see on the website or in the catalogue is slightly higher because it includes delivery and a wider range of flexible payment options to help spread the cost of purchases — a simple offer customers tell us they value			1
’ @entity127 owns a range of catalogues , including @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 , which feature some of the same brands , such as together and @entity112			1
a together parka coat costs £ 85 at @entity137 and @entity138 , but at @entity131 and @entity133 , it is £ 75 up to a size 18 , rising to £ 89 for a size 32			1
a @entity112 sequin and lace maxi dress is £ 95 at @entity114 and £ 99 at @entity132			1
these sort of price differences are standard practice , says retail expert @entity147 , who has worked with @entity148 and @entity149 , which owns many @entity151 stores such as @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154			2
‘ most retailers set their pricing driven by their particular brand			2
so , as they ’re separate brands , they may have similar products , but when they decide to launch an item and put it into their range , they would decide what price that should go in at for their particular market			2
’ what this means is that clothes are often priced at a premium , according to what the shops or catalogues think their customers will pay			0
a more upmarket catalogue may have higher prices than a cheap and cheerful one , without necessarily offering higher quality products			0
this ‘ dynamic pricing ’ is a tough challenge for online shoppers to navigate , since retailers vary prices according to anything from the time of year to location			0
@entity184 , an online travel firm in @entity185 , offers more expensive hotel deals to @entity188 computer users because they are statistically more likely to be willing to pay extra			0
and @entity185 department store @entity189 changes its prices daily , according to demand			0
@entity193 companies including @entity194 have been experimenting with similar approaches			0
‘ some things might have higher mark - ups than others , depending on what you believe it ’s worth to the customer , ’ says @entity147			2
‘ you ’re not going to have the same price for a swimsuit in @entity205 in september as in the @entity193 — you ’re going to think more creatively to cater for the market			2
‘ it ’s supply and demand : if you can get more money out of it , or if you need to clear your stock and sell it cheaper			2

the same coat is £ 115 from @entity1 but just £ 89 from @entity2
the @entity216 dress , costs £ 85 on the brand ’s website
it ’s the same price at @entity82
but if you buy the dress at @entity85 or @entity86 , it will cost you £ 108
a @entity112 sequin and lace maxi dress is £ 95 at @entity114
but it *'s* only £ 99 at @entity115
