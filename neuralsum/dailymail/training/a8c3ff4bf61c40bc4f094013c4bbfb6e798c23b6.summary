the @entity3 judges who sentenced @entity4 and @entity5 to death offered leniency in exchange for money , the men 's lawyers allege			1
the @entity11 duo could be executed within the week , with a meeting on monday to advise the @entity14 embassy of the formalities			0
but the pair 's lawyers will seek a meeting with @entity3 's attorney - general @entity19 on monday to ask for the executions to be delayed , pending further legal challenges			1
the team has made a complaint with the @entity24 , based on public comments by @entity4 and @entity5 's former lawyer , @entity26			1
he then went overseas without detailing his allegations			0
however , their lawyers now allege the six judges who sentenced @entity4 and @entity5 to death were ' willing to give a lighter sentence than the death penalty to ( @entity4 and @entity5 ) if the ( judges ) were given a sum of money '			1
the @entity47 said that in an extraordinary statement after visiting the men inside @entity50 , mr @entity26 said he was prepared to ' take the heat ' and provide the ' never revealed evidence ' to @entity4 and @entity5 's current lawyer , @entity53			1
' it 's something that implicates us , it could discredit me			0
but for them i will take it			0
i told @entity5 it 's okay , ' mr @entity26 said cryptically			2
' it 's one last thing i can do for them			0
' following his dramatic , if imprecise , comments , mr @entity26 left @entity3 to travel to @entity64 for a religious pilgrimage			0
both men have vowed that their time in jail has rehabilitated them and they deserve a reprieve but as the @entity11 pair on death row come to terms with their imminent execution , the @entity3 justice system is being accused of hypocrisy after a local ice manufacturer avoided the death penalty			1
while @entity14 @entity5 and @entity4 are facing the death penalty for attempting to smuggle drugs into @entity14 from @entity31 , local kingpin @entity80 has been given only a jail sentence for a similar crime			1
despite hundreds of pleas for clemency for @entity5 and @entity4 , @entity3 president @entity83 maintains that his hard - line stance against drug dealers will not budge			1
but the story of @entity80 , an @entity3 ice manufacturer who was convicted in 2007 and was handed the death penalty before his appeal - which followed directly after the @entity11 duos ' - won him both a reduced sentence and most importantly , his life , @entity95 reports			1
this is despite @entity98 , who owned the drug - producing business based in @entity100 , @entity101 , and organised ice 's distribution , was caught by police with over 11kg of the drug			0
when @entity4 and @entity5 lodged their final appeal to the @entity109 in @entity110 in 2011 , numbered case 37 and 38 , @entity98 's appeal for life was directly after theirs , numbered 39			1
but while the @entity14 ' judicial review were rejected , in @entity116 's it was decided that the death penalty violated both the @entity3 constitution , the country 's human rights and quoted the @entity121 , according to @entity95			1
his prison sentence was subsequently reduced to 12 years and @entity98 was saved from execution			0
the result presents a stark contrast to the trials endured by @entity4 and @entity5 who are expected to be moved to @entity128 - a prison island off @entity129 - where prisoners on death row are executed			1
@entity5 and @entity4 are expected to be taken to @entity128 , where they will be executed by firing squad despite their proven rehabilitation a general view shows the death island of @entity128 island , upon which @entity3 's maximum security prison is located and prisoners on death row are executed from there they will be given 72 hours ' notice of their execution by firing squad			1
prime minister @entity147 has also called out @entity3 's justice system for its hypocrisy after mr @entity83 offered ' optimum protection ' for over 200 of his citizens who face death sentences overseas - some of them being drug smugglers			1
' i should also just observe today that millions of @entity14 are feeling very , very upset about what may soon happen to two @entity14 in @entity3 , ' mr @entity147 said			1
' my plea even at this late stage is for @entity3 to be as responsive to us as it expects other countries to be to them when they plead for the lives of their citizens on death row overseas			2
' @entity14 has not decided how it would respond to the executions , including whether to withdraw its ambassador , but mr @entity147 told @entity167 newspaper : ' we will find ways of making our displeasure known			1
' @entity3 's @entity171 has confirmed it has invited all embassies with citizens to be executed this month to a meeting on the formalities on monday			2
prime minister @entity147 called out @entity3 's justice system for its hypocrisy after mr @entity83 offered ' optimum protection ' for over 200 of his citizens who face death sentences overseas - some of them being drug smugglers a date for the executions wo n't be provided at the meeting , but the provision of 72 hours notice will be discussed , as well as access to the prisoners for family and logistics over foreign media coverage			1
@entity191 spokesman @entity190 says officials representing @entity193 , @entity194 , the @entity195 and @entity196 have also been summoned			0
when @entity3 executed five foreign nationals last month , the meeting with relevant embassies took place one day before attorney - general @entity201 announced the execution date			2
that announcement signalled the 72 - hour notice period			0
but in this case , the prisoners have to be transferred from jails all over @entity3 to the execution location , nusakambangan island , off @entity129			2
@entity3 police tighten security at the main gate of maximum security prison @entity128 authorities have permission to move @entity4 and @entity5 from @entity31 's @entity50 jail , but have n't set a date			1
foreign minister @entity219 on friday suggested the depth of feeling in @entity14 is so strong that @entity14 may boycott @entity3 if the executions go ahead , but she denied that she was urging for a boycott			2
' i knew that there was very deep concern in the @entity14 public about the likely executions of mr @entity5 and mr @entity4 , and that @entity14 will make their own decisions as to whether they want to travel to a country that does have the death penalty , ' ms @entity219 told @entity232 on saturday			1
death - row prisoner @entity5 's sister @entity234 , left , and his mother @entity233 , right , have been visiting him every day @entity4 mother 's @entity237 arrives to visit her son at @entity50 on thursday boycott calls were growing on social media before ms @entity219 's remarks and politicians have received a flood of letters about the executions			1
ms @entity219 's opposition counterpart @entity247 told the @entity248 she did n't think this was helpful			0
' i 'm really not sure that boycotting @entity31 is going to make much of a difference to the attitude in @entity110 , ' ms @entity247 said			0
@entity4 and @entity5 have been disturbed by the evident preparation for their execution as prison guards broke open the lock to their jail cells to conduct a search			2
artist @entity260 says @entity5 is no longer sleeping as he waits with dread for a final knock on his door to take him to his execution by firing squad			0

' he knows someone will knock on his door in the middle of the night			0
i offered to bring him valium but he said ' no '			0
he is completely free from drugs and wo n't even take sleeping pills , ' @entity260 told @entity284			0
the @entity14 artist , who in 2011 won the @entity286 , has been @entity5 's mentor since 2012 , helping him develop a talent for painting			2
@entity14 's efforts to stop the executions have so far failed , along with desperate legal bids			0
their @entity293 families are in @entity31 , where they have spent the past three weeks paying daily visits to the men in @entity50 jail			0
over the past decade they 've been imprisoned there , @entity4 and @entity5 have transformed into model inmates , who have helped scores of others rehabilitate and get drug - free			2
officials have been granted permission to transfer the two men from @entity50 jail in @entity31			0
