tinderbox : how the @entity6 sparked the @entity7 and how the @entity8 , attempts to pinpoint the birth and early life of @entity2 and @entity7			1
considering a wealth of evidence , the authors suggest that the @entity14 during the late 19th and early 20th century helped turn localised outbreaks of the infection into a global epidemic			0
@entity18 and @entity20 's book supports a wealth of research that suggests that the colonisation of @entity4 helped spark the @entity2 epidemic co-authors @entity18 and @entity20 told the @entity25 : ' it ’s clear that colonial commerce created massive new networks of sexual interactions - and massive new transmissions of infections			1
' in later decades , transmission through the reuse of hypodermic needles in medical care probably had some role in @entity2 ’s spread as well			1
' looking at previous studies @entity18 and @entity20 trace the journey of @entity2 from chimpanzee - to - human transmission in southeastern @entity41 to widespread infection in the trading capital of @entity44			1
@entity2 is a virus most commonly caught by having unprotected sex or by sharing infected needles to inject drugs			1
