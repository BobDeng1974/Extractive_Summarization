from ' here 's you a piece of pizza ' to ' this glass needs washed ' , every state has its own set of phrases that can seem bizarre to the rest of the @entity10 - speaking world			1
in @entity13 , for instance , there 's a tendency to use the word ' so ' for drama , such as ' i 'm so totally over this			1
' some people in @entity20 think nothing of saying ' did n't nobody help him ' , while @entity25 residents can be heard using the phrase , ' i ai n't never had no trouble with none of ' em. ' click on a location marker in the map below to hear common phrases for each state all of my clothes needs washed - @entity37			1
. and wad n't anybody home but me - @entity40 do n’t none of y’all work as hard as i do - @entity43 we all use night - crawlers anymore - @entity45 i so might run this [ race ] with you - @entity49 i ai n't never had no trouble with none of ' em - @entity25 you are so in the @entity52 for that on - @entity13 @entity53 can be a professional job anymore - @entity55 now researchers at @entity57 have revealed these patterns by documenting the subtle differences in sentence structure across the @entity61			1
their interactive map allows you to click on a location and see common phrases for a region , as well as its source			1
while the map focuses on the @entity61 , it also has a small amount of data for the @entity71 , with sentences such as ' yer lugs needs washed ' used in @entity75 and ' @entity76 don hum no good ' , in @entity77			1
' unlike variation in phonology ( often referred to as accent ) and in the lexicon ( different words ) , variation in grammatical systems within @entity10 has for the most part not been systematically investigated , ' says @entity86 , professor of linguistics and philosophy at @entity57			0
' this variation may be found among speakers who live in a certain geographical region , or who belong to a certain age group , or to a particular social or ethnic group , ' he adds			0
during the past year , members of the project have been conducting nationwide surveys using an online crowdsourcing platform asking for people 's judgment on sentences			1
the researchers were not interested in what is considered to be correct grammar , but in what people do naturally			1
as well as the map , the team has also created a comprehensive guide that lists the different types of sentence structures used			2
one of the most interesting discoveries are presentative sentences like ' here 's you a water bottle			1
' ' that sentence just floored me , ' says postdoctoral associate @entity119 , a @entity57 lecturer in linguistics			0
' it seemed very alien and different to me			0
' the overall pattern was clear ; in the @entity124 people found that sentence to be completely normal , while in the @entity127 , it was almost unheard of			2
from ' here 's you a piece of pizza ' to ' this glass needs washed ' , every state has its own phrases that can seem odd to the rest of the world ' it 's a reason did n't nobody help him ' , is a common sentence structure used in @entity20 , claims the study authors at @entity57 while the map focuses on the @entity61 , it also has a small amount of data for the @entity71 , with sentences such as ' yer lugs needs washed ' used in @entity75 ( left ) and ' @entity76 don hum no good ' , in @entity77			1
and @entity13 is n't the only region that uses ' so ' to add emphasis to a sentence			2
@entity153 also appear to have picked up the habit ( right ) ' it was pretty stunning , and it turns out you can do it with " where " as well			0
" where 's me a screwdriver ? " or " where 's me a place to eat around here ? " ' he added			2
other notable examples include ‘ do n’t none of y’all work as hard as i do ’ in @entity43 ; ‘ we all use night - crawlers anymore ’ in @entity45 ; and ‘ i ai n't never had no trouble with none of ' em ’ in @entity25			2
meanwhile , people in @entity171 sometimes use ' so do n't i ' , such as in the sentence , ' he plays guitar , but so do n't i '			2
linguistics professor @entity175 explained that there is also a social implication to this research			0
' often people are convinced that there is a right way of speaking a language and a wrong way of speaking that language			0
' from the point of view of a linguist , that is really off the mark for many reasons , ' she says			0
' we linguists can see through this , because we have a more scientific approach to language , ' says @entity175			0
' we believe that creating an awareness of what we consider to be basic facts about language can have a positive social effect , by making people aware that they are expressing a negative evaluation of others			0
' in @entity13 , as well as @entity49 , the map shows there 's a tendency to use the word ' so ' for drama , such as ' i 'm so totally over this ' linguistics professor @entity175 explained that there is also a social implication to this research			1
' we believe that creating an awareness of what we consider to be basic facts about language can have a positive social effect , by making people aware that they are expressing a negative evaluation of others , ' she said			0
on the left is an example of a phrase used in @entity226 , and on the right , @entity227 an interesting find in @entity230 was use of ' this glass needs washed ' which echoes the @entity75 use of ' yer lugs needs washed '			0

in @entity13 and @entity49 , there is a tendency for people to use the word ' so ' in sentences to *increase* drama
phrases such as ' here 's you a water bottle ' are common in the south , but people in the north find it *strange*
