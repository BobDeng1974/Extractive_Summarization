by @entity0 published : 03:35 est , 21 may 2012 updated : 06:17 est , 21 may 2012 thousands of a-level students who hoped to secure university places last year could have been given the wrong marks , a whistleblower has claimed			0
senior exam board supervisor @entity5 found that 10 per cent of pupils should have received a higher grade when he checked papers where schools had queried their results			1
another 10 per cent should have been given a lower grade because final scores were added up wrongly by examiners , mr @entity5 said			1
cheated ? senior exam board supervisor said 10 per cent of pupils should have received a higher grade when he checked papers queried by schools the claims are the latest in a long line of controversies relating to @entity23 's chaotic exams system , which have raised grave concerns about standards			1
mr @entity5 said that , following requests from schools in august 2011 for re-marking , he and his team spotted basic clerical errors in 100 papers			1
this led them to carry out extended checks on other papers marked by the same examiners and found a further 200 errors			1
mr @entity5 said he emailed 30 schools to alert them to the problem affecting a-level and gcse papers after he was dissatisfied with a review ordered by the exam watchdog @entity44			1
he has been suspended by exam board @entity45			1
mr @entity5 claimed that , when he spotted the mistakes , he was told by @entity45 to stop the checks			1
' we were amazed , he told @entity50			0
' we wanted the candidates to receive the correct results and if these checks were not brought to light they would n't get the correct results			0
' ' it 's so bizarre , it should be of paramount significance to all of us who work within an awarding body that we issue correct results to our candidates			0
' it 's the number one priority that we have			0
to tell people that have uncovered mistakes that you must discontinue these checks is outrageous			2
' @entity45 say their assessors checked the scripts of over 1,100 examiners and in only a few cases did this affect the overall grade that had been awarded			1
whistleblower : @entity5 claims he was told to stop checking exam papers after he spotted mistakes but that view is disputed by mr @entity5 , who claims that he has uncovered an additional 50 to 100 papers with marking errors in the last few weeks			1
he said : ' we checked 50,000 scripts and found 700 errors			2
' i believe there would have been thousands			0
not thousands of incorrect grades , but thousands of incorrect results issued			0
' a spokesman for @entity45 said : ' @entity45 's top priority at this time is to reassure those taking exams now that our systems have been significantly improved			0
' the exam board has introduced new stages into the checking of manually marked scripts , which it says ' will ensure a high level of clerical accuracy '			1
it said it was processing the disputed exam papers and would make grade changes , if required			1
the spokesman added : ' we confirm that a supervisor has been suspended pending investigation			1
' to say anything more would prejudice the investigation			0
' we support @entity44 's planned review of examination marking and will be glad to share any lessons learnt from last year 's mistakes			2
' an @entity44 spokesman said : ' mr @entity5 is now making two serious allegations about last summer 's exam series : that @entity45 did not properly do the checks that it claimed to have done , and also that it misled the regulator			1
' we need to establish as a matter of urgency whether these allegations are true			0
' we have written to @entity45 seeking an urgent explanation			0
' we would ask that mr @entity5 also shares all the documents he has with us			1
' we will not comment further on this case until we have seen @entity45 's full response			0
' if we find @entity45 has acted improperly we will take the matter further and if appropriate use our enforcement powers			0
' in a statement , the @entity131 said : ' the level of error here is simply unacceptable			1
' we have been crystal clear that exam boards must produce papers that are error - free , and award the correct grades to students			2
revision : @entity45 has changed the way it checks papers to ensure a high level of clerical accuracy ' ' it is exactly these kinds of issues that have led us to strengthen @entity44 's regulatory powers and introduce a new power to allow them to fine exam boards in the future			2
' we are continuing to look at whether even stronger powers are needed			0
' mr @entity5 's claims were revealed less than 48 hours after the head of the @entity159 's largest exam board cast doubt over a-level and @entity163 standards			1
@entity164 , president of @entity159 , which owns @entity165 , said that boards should be ‘ worried ’ about the pattern of ever improving results			0
he stopped short of agreeing there had been grade inflation but admitted it was ' indisputable ' that grades in a-levels and gcses had improved			2
exam board officials have previously defended standards , insisting that year - on - year grade improvements were due to students ’ hard work			1
a newspaper investigation last december revealed how seminars were giving teachers vital information about papers			0
it also exposed one of the chief examiners at @entity165 boasting about how the board had managed to clear easy exams with @entity44			2
@entity190 , a senior official at @entity165 , told an undercover reporter , posing as a geography teacher considering using the firm ’s gcse exams , that ‘ you do n’t have to teach a lot ’			2
another @entity165 @entity198 official boasted about how , thanks to easy coursework , ‘ weak kids ’ could get through ‘ on anything really ’			0
@entity44 later announced it was banning thousands of exam seminars , which posed ‘ unacceptable risks ’ to the integrity of the system			2
some teachers expected to receive ‘ privileged information ’ about exams , it claimed .			0
