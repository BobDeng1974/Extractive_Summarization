by @entity0 published : 08:38 est , 6 may 2013 updated : 02:45 est , 7 may 2013 could you tell the difference between a human eye and the eye of a tiger , python , or a lemur ? this is the premise behind @entity11 photographer @entity10 's latest collection , which features extreme close - up images showing eyes of animals , birds and reptiles			1
the collection includes rodents , hyenas , lemurs , monkeys , tiger pythons , cats , dogs , snakes , birds , a fox and even a flying possum			1
@entity30 dog : huskies mainly live in the @entity32 and are known for having pale blue eyes			1
however , some species have been known to have brown , green and yellow eyes fennec fox : the fennec is a small nocturnal fox that lives in the @entity40 desert in @entity41			1
its eye resembles what paleontologists believe many dinosaur eyes to look like			1
the fox is known for its large ears , which help keep it cool lark : larks are passerine birds , also known as perching birds or songbirds			2
the majority live in dry regions , in northern and eastern @entity56			2
larks are medium - sized birds , between five to eight inches long and weigh between 15 and 75 grams long - eared owl : the long - eared owl is indigenous to @entity61 , @entity62 , and @entity63			2
it is between 12 to 16 inches long and has a wingspan of around 39 inches chinchilla : the chinchilla has the most distinctive pupil of @entity10 's collection			1
it is a rodent native to the @entity71 mountains in @entity72			2
the name chinchilla means ' little chincha ' and is named after the @entity76 people of the @entity71 , who used to wear its fur @entity79 ( @entity80 ) is an example of biometric identification			2
biometrics uses a person 's unique features , such as irises and fingerprints , to identify who they are			2
everyone 's iris has a complex , random pattern that is different to anyone elses			2
@entity80 uses mathematical pattern - recognition techniques to scan this random design			2
the scans analyse more than 200 points that can be used for comparison , including rings and freckles			2
the technology was first proposed in 1936 by ophthalmologist @entity101			2
in 1987 two ophthalmologists , @entity103 and @entity104 , patented the idea			2
@entity106 then created algorithms for iris recognition in 1989			2
each of the photos in @entity10 's collection show the complex surface of individual animal eyes			1
many of @entity116 's images were taken of animals in captivity at @entity119 in @entity11			1
@entity116 's @entity121 collection was a follow - up to his @entity124 series which features extreme close - up images of human eyes			1
although the eyes look different , they work in a very similar way to human eyes			1
the main parts of the eye include the cornea , pupil , iris , retina and radial and sphincter muscles			0
when the animals look around , the light reflected from different objects enter their eyes through the transparent cover called the cornea			1
the light then travels into the eye through the pupil			0
the pupil is the black circular part in the centre of your eyeball			0
the varying pupil shapes and sizes of the animals in @entity10 's collection is determined by where in the world they live and how much sunlight they get			1
it also depends on whether they are nocturnal or not			0
lemur : lemurs only see in black and white			0
this means they do n't choose food based on what it looks like , but instead of how it smells			0
their monochrome vision makes it easier to see at night			0
the word ' lemur ' comes from the roman mythological word , lemures , which means ghosts or spirits iguana : iguanas use their eyes to navigate through forests and find food			1
they use visual signals to communicate with other iguanas , and have a third ' eye ' on top of their heads called the parietal eye			0
the parietal eye is a scale that contains photoreceptors to detect different light ranges @entity198 tiger python : the albino tiger python is a specially bred species of the @entity202 python , found predominantly in @entity62			1
they can grow up to around seven metres long making them the world 's longest reptiles rhesus macaque : also known as the rhesus monkey , their eyes most closely resemble human eyes			1
in january 2000 the rhesus macaque became the first primate to be cloned , and in january 2001 , the first transgenic rhesus primate was born that contained genes taken from jellyfish black kite : the black kite is a bird of prey , so - called because it soars and glides in search of food , and can change direction smoothly and quickly			0
the birds often get electrocuted because they perch on electric wires radial fibres within the iris - the coloured part of the eye - pull the pupil open when it 's dark to let more light in and make it easier to see in low - light conditions			0
nocturnal animals , such as the @entity236 fox , have larger pupils to make easier to see at night			0
sphincter fibres help the pupil contract to restrict how much light enters the eye in bright conditions			0
chimpanzee : chimpanzees , also known as chimps , have eyes similar to humans because they can distinguish colours that other mammals ca n't see			1
the eyes on a chimp are close together , like on humans , so they can see stereoscopically and make out shapes in @entity254 , with depth perception @entity256 : the tockus is a type of hornbill bird found in @entity41			1
they have binocular vision , although unlike most birds with this type of eyesight , the tockus ' bill can sometimes get in the way and obstruct their view guinea pig : the guinea - pig is a domesticated rodent , also known as cavy			0
it does n't exist naturally in the wild			0
the term to be used as a ' guinea pig ' , referring to being a test subject , comes from when the rodents were tested on during the 19th century @entity279 : spotted hyena cubs are born almost fully developed with their eyes open			1
although they look like felines , they behave more like canines and have a keen sense of smell which they use for hunting			0
their body parts are used for medicines in some parts of @entity41 siamese cat : the siamese cat originated in @entity296 , formerly @entity297			0
they are known as @entity299 or ' moon diamond ' because of the shape and colouring of their eyes			1
only pure bred siamese cats have light blue eyes a human eye , looking uncannily similar to many of the animal eyes husky dogs live in very bright conditions in the @entity32 , so their pupils are smaller			1
the lens focuses the light onto the back of the eye called the retina			0
the retina is made of thousands of light - sensitive neurons , called photoreceptors , which change light signals into electrical ones			0
these electrical signals are then sent to the brain along the optic nerve and the brain processes what it 's looking at in the visual cortex			0
when you look at an object it is projected onto your retina upside down			0
your brain then turns it the correct way up			0
there are some differences , however , depending on the species			0
for example , lemurs can only see in black and white so use their sense of smell to choose which food to eat			0
and husky dogs can have different coloured eyes because of a condition called heterochromia			1
