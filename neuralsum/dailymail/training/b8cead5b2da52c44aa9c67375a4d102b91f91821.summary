@entity1 chairman @entity0 does not feel @entity3 's appointment as @entity5 manager will suddenly transform the club into winners			1
city head to @entity5 on saturday for @entity3 's first official match in charge following back - to - back 4 - 1 defeats to @entity12 and @entity13 in the @entity14 and @entity15 respectively			1
with manager @entity18 ' side also struggling defensively due to a spate of injuries , and with @entity5 buoyed by their 2 - 1 @entity15 win over @entity21 which @entity3 watched from the stands , many observers may feel a home victory is on the cards			1
@entity3 was unveiled as @entity5 's new manager on monday following @entity27 's sacking @entity3 faces the media for the first time since he was appointed as @entity5 's new boss @entity3 watches with delight as @entity5 beat @entity21 to progress to the sixth round @entity15 despite that , speaking to the @entity32 , @entity0 said : ' the appointment of a new manager does n't mean they have won the game already			1
' the idea the world is suddenly transformed after bringing in a new manager does n't ring true			2
' i think it 's about 50 - 50 statistically over whether you win or lose that first match			2
' i remember going to @entity45 some years ago and people fearing the worst because @entity47 had just been appointed , but we came away with all three points			2
' @entity0 , meanwhile , has defended @entity18 ' decision to send defender @entity51 on loan to @entity21 despite the club 's injury woes			1
@entity51 , only recently returning from his own long - term injury problems , joined the @entity56 last month for the remainder of the campaign			0
@entity60 ( left ) and @entity61 ( right ) have both suffered injuries at @entity1 @entity1 allowed @entity51 to join @entity21 on loan in january but are now short of centre backs @entity18 , however , has suddenly lost @entity60 , @entity65 and @entity61 , with little else available via way of cover			1
@entity0 said : ' yes , i can understand why supporters would be asking ' why did you let him go ? ' , but equally i can understand the management team 's reasons for doing so			0
' they wanted to give him games after his long - term knee injury and it was felt reserve games were n't suitable			0
' we had also brought in @entity79 to add to the centre - halves we had here			0
' the timing was then very unfortunate with the injuries that followed the decision to let @entity51 go			0
' @entity60 has a wonderful appearance record , for instance , but then came that bad run of injuries which included him , @entity65 and now @entity61			0
