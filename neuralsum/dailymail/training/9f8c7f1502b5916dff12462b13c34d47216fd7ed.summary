@entity0 just can not believe he is here			1
not perched on the ring apron in a @entity3 gym , drenched in sweat with just a motorway hotel to look forward to after a 90 - minute training session			2
but here he is , preparing to fight in front of a sell - out crowd at @entity11 ’s @entity10 in saturday ’s rematch with @entity13 at cruiserweight in one of the most eagerly - awaited bouts of the year			1
‘ i was never meant to get this far , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ this was n’t a life that i could have envisaged when i was younger			2
i was the fat kid who was going nowhere			2
i had teachers who told me i was n’t going to do anything with my life			2
‘ i remember my own mother saying , “ son , give up this boxing game			2
you ’re not the kind of person who does it ”			2
‘ when your own mother does n’t think you should box , it does n’t look good			2
no mother wants to see their son punched in the face but i ’ve got a dad who loves me just as much and he always believed i would be world champion			2
@entity0 has chance for revenge after @entity13 claimed a controversial majority points victory in 2011 @entity13 retained his @entity53 light - heavyweight title by beating @entity0 three years ago ‘ i am driven			1
i could win £ 100million on the lottery and it would n’t be enough			2
if i make these next few fights work for me , it could be massive			2
’ @entity0 , 31 , feels boxing found him , rather than the other way around			1
born and raised in @entity11 , he identified with @entity59 and @entity60 but dreamed of pulling on @entity62 ’s no 9 shirt rather than lacing up the gloves			1
‘ i played around with boxing at 15 or 16 , ’ he says			2
‘ i did n’t take it seriously			2
i still had dreams of playing for @entity62 but i was too fat			0
@entity0 says he loves boxing and identifies with the likes of @entity59 and @entity60 ‘ i was always fascinated with @entity59 and @entity60 , people who came from backgrounds like i did			1
‘ i ’m from an unforgiving neighbourhood but it ’s great			1
i grew up with loving people			0
i ’ve got the same friends i had when i was 10			0
some would say it ’s a dump but to me , it ’s a palace			1
’ by his late teens , @entity0 was taking two buses across the city to reach the @entity82 gym where , by night , he was moulded into a three - time national amateur champion			1
by day , @entity0 was finding his feet in the world of work			1
@entity0 remains adamant he has the measure of @entity13 , who is almost five years his junior at 27 ‘ i ’ve been a labourer , i ’ve worked security , i ’ve worked the door at nightclubs , been a lifeguard , worked in retail			1
i even worked in a pillow factory , ’ he recalls			0
‘ getting £ 150 a week to stuff pillows makes you appreciate the good things			0
‘ i worked from seven till four and then it was straight to the gym			0
i won my first title during the 12 months i was there and that made me realise how hard i had to work to go further			0
’ after fewer than 50 amateur fights , @entity0 turned professional			1
sixteen victories later he was thrust into a fight with then world champion @entity13			1
@entity0 and trainer @entity106 work out in the gym in @entity3 @entity0 says his hatred for @entity13 stems from the @entity109 telling him in the ring that it had been his toughest fight but later , in front of the press , claiming he had sailed through in second gear			1
@entity13 , 27 , says @entity0 is bitter and jealous of his success			1
‘ there is nothing in his career i could possibly want , ’ counters @entity0			1
‘ i tried to win a world title at light - heavyweight and i fought the best in the division			0
if i die tomorrow , i ’d die a happy man			0
@entity0 turned up the heat on @entity125 by branding the @entity109 ' a fraud ' ‘ we ’re from completely different environments			1
i was working nightclub security when he was in school			0
he does n’t love boxing because he does n’t know anything about boxing			0
i probably know more about his career than he does			0
i ’ve studied boxing since i was a kid			0
he boxes for a living , i do it because i love it			0
i ’d do it for free			0
‘ he ( @entity13 ) has this thing about being world champion , but was he really ? it was a joke that our fight was for a world title			1
he came up against me after 16 fights ; i ’m a completely different fighter now			0
‘ the one thing we do have in common is that we come to fight but i just have more evil intentions , i ’m a different breed			1
’ throughout his career , @entity0 has made almost as many headlines out of the ring as in it			1
last year , his claim that he was ‘ willing to die in the ring ’ sparked outrage			0
‘ it ’s like saying you know the risks when you get on a plane , ’ he says			1
‘ there ’s a 99 per cent chance it wo n’t happen but it could			1
getting in the ring is 100 times as bad			0
i ’m not saying i want to die			0
i ’m saying i ’d rather die than quit			0
‘ that ’s why i ’m different			1
it would kill me to quit			0
i do n’t glorify it , it ’s the horrible side of boxing			1
leaving my kids is what frightens me more than anything but it ’s the only way i can provide a living for them			1
@entity0 is ready to fight in front of a sell - out crowd at @entity11 ’s @entity10 on saturday ‘ i ’ve come out of fights and ( been ) p * * * * * * blood ... my face @entity182 and both hands broken			1
‘ i ’ve been in brutal fights			0
i ’ve dragged myself off the floor			0
i can say i ’m willing to die in the ring because that ’s what i ’m about			1
‘ i ’m too honest for my own good			0
i ’m just telling them what i think			0
sometimes that is bad , sometimes it ’s good			1
sometimes i let people in too much but that ’s just me			1
‘ do i want to kill anyone ? of course not			0
it ’s a brutal sport but i do n’t get paid to kill anyone			2
i get paid to knock someone out for 10 seconds			0
that ’s what i ’m trying to do but if you push the buttons you will get a reaction			2
‘ i ’m a good person and i want to represent the sport i love in a good light			0
i ’ve not done anything to be proud of yet but i ’ll get there soon enough			0
’ cleverly vs @entity211 is exclusively live on @entity212 on saturday with @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215 also on the bill			2
