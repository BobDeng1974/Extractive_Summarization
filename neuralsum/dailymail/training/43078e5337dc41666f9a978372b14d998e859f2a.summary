by @entity0 a five - year - old with a rare condition has never had a birthday party or been on holiday - because the excitement could kill her			1
@entity6 suffers from such a severe form of epilepsy that even a gust of wind or a fit of giggles could trigger a life - threatening seizure			1
her parents say they are living with a ‘ ticking time bomb ’ because they never know when too much excitement or over exertion could induce a fit			2
@entity6 ( pictured with her mother , @entity19 ) , five , has a rare and severe form of epilepsy which means something as simple as a giggling fit could trigger a life - threatening seizure @entity6 rarely attends play dates and can never go swimming with her brother because the risk of over-excitement and infection is too high			1
@entity6 ’s condition , called @entity32 syndrome , has seen her have seizures lasting up to one - and - a - half - hours and up to 200 electric shock type fits a day			1
she is also at high risk of @entity36 ( sudden unexplained death in epilepsy ) and sleeps with a monitor that warns her parents when her heart rate or oxygen levels change			2
her mother , @entity19 , said : ‘ @entity6 is probably the happiest little girl you will ever come across			1
she is always smiling and giggling			0
‘ but it can feel like you are looking after a ticking time bomb as caring for a child with @entity32 is very stressful			2
‘ you never know when the next life - threatening seizure will come , or if a little one will turn into a big one			1
i feel incredibly grateful every morning when she wakes up and says hello			0
@entity6 's condition is controlled by a special diet which sees her having to be given syringes full of oil and water bright light and wind can also trigger @entity6 's seizures so she has to wear sunglasses when she goes out and she has to stay inside when it is windy ‘ we really do have to put a limit on excitement			1
and even a common virus could lead to a increase in her temperature , which can cause a seizure			1
‘ it ’s quite sad really , always having to tell your child , “ do n’t laugh too much ” or “ do n’t giggle too much ” and telling our son not to make her laugh			0
’ mrs @entity6 , and her husband @entity73 , 40 , first noticed something was wrong with @entity6 when she was just four months old			2
@entity75 is a rare and catastrophic form of epilepsy that begins in infancy			1
children with @entity80 tend to have normal development as babies but development starts to plateau when they are in their second year of life			0
individuals with @entity32 syndrome face a higher incidence of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy patients ( @entity36 )			1
they often also experience other conditions including developmental delays , sleeping difficulties , chronic infections and difficulty feeding			0
there is currently no cure and treatment options are limited - they mainly involve using anti-epilepsy drugs to treat the seizures			0
@entity101 is known about the long term prognosis of people with @entity75			0
as they attended a christening she began to shake in her father ’s arms , and when it finally stopped after 25 minutes , she was rushed to hospital			0
@entity6 spent a week in hospital where doctors tested her for a number of different conditions , including meningitis			2
but the baffled medics were unable to come up with any explanations , and @entity6 suffered dozens of other fits before they finally gave her the diagnosis when she was 18 months old			2
dravet syndrome is a rare form epilepsy , with figures suggesting that of every 500 children diagnosed with epilepsy , only two are likely to have the condition			1
as it affects many different parts of the brain , there are a number of different triggers for seizures , as opposed to other epilepsies that might only affect one site			0
sufferers can therefore not undergo brain surgery			0
a slight change in body temperature due to illness can cause seizures as can overexcitement and overexertion			1
@entity6 also has photosensitive epilepsy so anything that can give a strobe effect , such as screens , light through leaves or through a net , can cause a seizure			1
sufferers never grow out of @entity32 syndrome and most will need care their entire lives			1
many also may be on the autism spectrum and be developmentally delayed - often having mobility issues , behavioural problems and difficulty sleeping			0
mrs @entity6 , from @entity157 , @entity158 , said : ‘ @entity32 syndrome affects every aspect of @entity6 ’s life , but still she smiles			1
‘ she is very environmentally sensitive , the wind causes seizures so if it is a windy day she ca n’t go outside			0
she has to wear sunglasses whenever she is outside too			0
@entity6 had her first seizure when she was four months old but was not diagnosed until she was 18 months old @entity6 is unlikely ever to grow out of her epilepsy and her parents say she is like a ' ticking time bomb ' ‘ she ca n’t control her body temperature , so i ca n’t put her in tights for example			1
she does n’t tend to go outside over the winter at all			0
in the summer the heat is even more of a risk			0
‘ we went through a stage where time on the trampoline would cause seizures or the sunlight through leaves			0
’ mr and mrs @entity6 have to be particularly careful when she is around other children or doing fun activities			2
‘ we are always very careful about germs as even common childhood illnesses can lead to severe seizures			1
we do n’t take her to public swimming baths or soft play centres for this reason , ’ said mrs @entity6			1
‘ when we do take her swimming somewhere private she goes in for 10 minutes and then it ’s out again because she loves it so much that she gets overexcited			0
’ but the schoolgirl - who was taught at home for two years to avoid infection from other children - is finally getting a taste of normal life , thanks to a special diet			2
mrs @entity6 said : ' you never know when the next life - threatening seizure will come , or if a little one will turn into a big one			1
i feel incredibly grateful every morning when she wakes up and says hello ' the eating plan has helped keep her seizures under control			0
@entity6 was in and out of hospital and had four stays in intensive care over 18 months until she started on the ketogenic diet			2
the diet alters the body ’s chemistry by convincing it that it is starving and is formulated to sustain the state of ketosis within the body			0
forcing the body into a state of ketosis causes a build - up of ketones which in turn act as a kind of sedative , preventing the sudden disturbances in the electrical functioning of the brain that lead to seizure activity			1
full time carer @entity233 added : ‘ it has been absolutely brilliant			0
@entity6 only had to be rushed to hospital once in the last two years , whereas we went more than 60 times in the first three years			2
‘ she still has seizures every day but they are small and she copes with them			0
we have n’t had any bigger ones since february and prior to that we had n’t had one for nearly two years			0
mrs @entity6 says that despite @entity6 's special diet she still has seizures every day ‘ day to day the diet means i weigh every gram of every bit of food that goes into @entity6 ’s mouth			1
‘ about 75 per cent of what she eats is fat in the form of healthy oils , and we make the rest up with protein , fruits and vegetables - but we even have to give her syringes full of oil			2
‘ as a result of the diet we ’ve managed to wean her off some of her anti-epilepsy drugs , it ’s been amazing to get to know our little girl without all the medications and the side effects that they cause			0
’ ‘ caring for a child with @entity32 syndrome can be a very lonely and isolating experience because you have to spend so much time at home keeping your child safe , ’ she continues , ‘ we have a wonderfully supportive charity , @entity75 @entity274 and i really do n’t know what i would have done without all the practical and emotional support from other parents who are going through the same experience			1

@entity6 has a rare and severe form of epilepsy called @entity32 syndrome
something as simple as a giggling fit can trigger a life - threatening seizure
an increase in her body temperature can also cause a seizure
as a result , she has to be *protected* from childhood illnesses
this means she can not go swimming or to play centres
