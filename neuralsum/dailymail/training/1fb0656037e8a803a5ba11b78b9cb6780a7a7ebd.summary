women who took @entity2 antidepressants during pregnancy were three times more likely to have a baby boy with autism mothers - to - be who take antidepressants have an increased risk of having a child with autism , a study has found			1
@entity14 researchers say women who took commonly prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors - @entity2 - were three times more likely to have a baby boy with autism or developmental delays			1
the effect of the drugs , prescribed for depression , anxiety and other disorders , is particularity pronounced during the third trimester , they say			1
researchers from the @entity27 looked at nearly 1,000 mothers and their babies			0
the study , published online in the journal @entity32 , looked at data from mother - child pairs in the @entity35 ( @entity37 ) study			0
the researchers divided the data up into three groups - children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder ( @entity42 ) , those with developmental delays and those with typical development			0
all the children were aged between two to five and of them , 82 per cent of those with autism were boys , 66 per cent with developmental delay were boys , as were 86 per cent of those with typical development			0
while the study included girls , the substantially stronger effect in boys alone suggests they may be much more susceptible for the effects of @entity2 in the womb , the researchers concluded			1
' we found prenatal @entity2 exposure was nearly three times as likely in boys with autism relative to typical development , with the greatest risk when exposure took place during the first trimester , ' said study author @entity67			2
' @entity2 was also elevated among boys with developmental delay , with the strongest exposure effect in the third trimester			2
' the effect of the drugs , prescribed for depression , anxiety and other disorders , is particularity pronounced during the third trimester the ' happy ' hormone serotonin is critical to early brain development , so the researchers suggest exposure during pregnancy to anything that influences serotonin levels can have potential effect on birth and developmental outcomes			1
with diagnoses of autism on the rise , they suggest increased use of @entity2 in recent years may be contributing to this			2
commenting on the study , @entity92 , chief of the @entity93 at @entity94 , said : ' this study provides further evidence that in some children , prenatal exposure to @entity2 may influence their risk for developing an autism spectrum disorder			0
' this research also highlights the challenge for women and their physicians to balance the risks versus the benefits of taking these medications , given that a mother 's underlying mental - health conditions also may pose a risk , both to herself and her child			0

the effect of the drugs is particularity pronounced during third trimester
researchers suggest rising rates of autism and @entity2 use may be linked
