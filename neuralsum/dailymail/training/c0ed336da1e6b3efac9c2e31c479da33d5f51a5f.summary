by @entity1 reporter published : 22:06 est , 14 march 2014 updated : 22:07 est , 14 march 2014 failings last spring by nuclear missile operators at an air force base in @entity6 were worse than first reported , according to documents obtained by @entity1			1
airmen responsible for missile operations at @entity10 would have failed their portion of a major inspection in march 2013 but managed a ' marginal ' rating because their poor marks were blended with the better performance of support staff - like cooks and facilities managers - and they got a boost from the base 's highly rated training program			1
the ' marginal ' rating , the equivalent of a 'd ' in school , was reported previously			0
now , details of the low performance by the launch officers , or missileers , entrusted with the keys to missiles have been revealed			2
' @entity35 technical proficiency substandard , ' one @entity33 briefing slide says			0
' remainder ( of missile operations team ) raised grade to marginal			2
' problems on the base : @entity10 missileers are embroiled in a cheating scandal the documents also hint at an exam - cheating problem in the making among launch crews at @entity10 , almost a full year before allegations of widespread cheating erupted this january at a companion nuclear base in @entity50			1
an official inquiry into the troubled inspection of the @entity53 at @entity10 in march 2013 concluded that one root cause was poor use of routine testing and other means of measuring the proficiency of launch crews in their assigned tasks			1
for example , commanders at @entity10 did not ensure that monthly written tests were supervised			1
the analysis also said @entity10 senior leaders failed to foster a " culture of accountability " and that mid-level leadership posts were left unfilled			1
in a more direct hint at fudging on exams , one document said , ' @entity73 ' was viewed as ' taking care of each other , ' " while adding that the missileers felt pressure to score 100 percent on every test			0
those are echoes of explanations @entity33 leaders have recounted from launch officers in the aftermath of the cheating scandal that surfaced in early january at the @entity85 at @entity86 , @entity50 at least 92 officers at @entity86 have been removed from launch duty for allegedly cheating or tolerating cheating by others , pending an investigation whose results may be released by the end of this month			1
the allegation at @entity86 is that information on ' emergency war orders ' exams , which test how a launch crew would handle classified messages related to missile targeting and launch , was shared in advance among launch officers			2
it 's not clear whether this or other forms of cheating have taken place at the @entity33 's two other icbm bases , but numerous former missileers have said in recent weeks that cheating does occur			2
not up to par : it has also been revealed that , if not for averaging scores together with cooks , missileers would not have passed competency tests without specifically mentioning the cheating scandal , the chairman of the @entity117 , rep. @entity118 ' @entity116 , said friday that while the vast majority of airmen in the nuclear missile corps are reliable and committed , he worries about the impact of reported shortcomings			1
' a few bad eggs put at risk the mission and taint the record of the rest of the @entity33 , ' @entity116 said at a hearing where air force secretary @entity130 and the air force chief of staff , gen. @entity132 , were testifying on the 2015 defense budget			1
' that can not be allowed to happen			0
' the @entity33 operates a total of 450 @entity137 nuclear missiles , divided evenly among the three bases			1
an @entity140 base has many interconnected pieces , including security forces that provide protection for the missiles and for the underground launch control centers , as well as commanders and others who work from a headquarters base			1
but at the mission 's core are the missileers and their mastery of ' emergency war orders , ' the secret messages that would authorize a launch			0
they are supported in the missile field by personnel known as facility managers , who run above - ground support buildings where security forces and others sleep and where cooks prepare meals for the full team			1
the @entity33 initially called the overall march inspection outcome at @entity10 a ' success , ' reflecting the fact that the @entity53 as a whole was rated ' satisfactory			1
' but after @entity1 learned in may about the ' marginal ' performance in the missile operations sector of the inspection , the service disclosed that 19 officers had been forced to surrender their launch authority in april because of performance and attitude problems			2
that was an unprecedented mass sidelining of launch control officers , reflecting what the 91st 's deputy operations commander at the time , lt. col. @entity185 , called ' rot ' in the force			2
on the defensive : secretary of the air force @entity130 , left , joined at right by chief of staff of the @entity33 gen. @entity132 , testifying friday before the @entity117 until now , however , it was not publicly known that of 11 crews tested on a launch simulator for the inspection , three were rated @entity196 , or ' unqualified , ' which the @entity33 defines as demonstrating ' an unacceptable level of safety , performance or knowledge			1
' five of the 11 earned a top rating and three got a second - tier rating			2
the @entity10 crews performed much better in a september reassessment			1
eleven of 12 launch crews received top qualification ratings , although one was rated unqualified with ' one critical and one major error			0
' in back - to - back inspections this january , the 91st as a whole was given outstanding marks			2
the newly available @entity33 documents were released to a private group in @entity218 called speaking truth to @entity220 after the group filed a lawsuit asserting that @entity223 , which oversees all @entity225 nuclear forces , had not provided documents requested under the @entity227			2
that private group , headed by lawyer @entity230 , advocates for the elimination of nuclear weapons			2
he shared the documents with the @entity1 problems inside the icbm force - many of them first reported by the @entity1 - prompted defense secretary @entity237 in january to order two reviews			1
a @entity240 team is seeking to define and fix the trouble , and an outside group is undertaking a broader assessment of nuclear weapons operations			2
@entity245 has said failures in this most sensitive of military missions threaten to erode public trust			0
chief of staff of @entity33 gen. @entity132 testifies before the @entity117 , the hearing was meant to debate the fiscal year 2015 budget , but revelations of the under - performing missileers were also discussed @entity256 , co-leader of the internal review , was at @entity258 , @entity259 , on thursday to review how the @entity33 's @entity140 launch crew training program is operated			1
all launch crews are required to train at @entity258 before being certified and assigned to one of the three operational icbm bases			0
one newly released document said the @entity10 wing in @entity6 had shown signs of weakness much earlier			1
in an april - may 2010 ' combat capability evaluation , ' two of 13 launch crews tested on the use of a launch simulator were deemed ' unqualified			0
' eight rated " highly qualified ' and three ' qualified			0
' by comparison , of 32 crews who underwent the same evaluation at the two other icbm bases in 2011 , 31 were rated either highly qualified or qualified and only one unqualified			0
on routine written tests , the @entity278 did exceptionally well until the spring of 2013			0
in assessing the problems at @entity10 , the @entity33 produced an analysis of test data that showed that in the two years prior to the march 2013 inspection , 87 percent of all tests resulted in perfect scores			1
in the three months following the weak inspection , 46 percent of test scores were perfect , including just 20 percent in may			0
it also found that errors on monthly written tests and errors on launch control simulators soared after the march inspection			0
in the 10 months of written tests prior to its inspection , the @entity10 missileers had a total of 162 ' job performance requirement ' errors , which are mistakes on what the @entity33 considers essential tasks			1
in the three months following the inspection the total doubled , to 321 errors , according to the data analysis			0
@entity33 officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment			0
after visiting all three icbm bases days after the @entity309 cheating scandal was disclosed , air force secretary @entity130 said she was troubled to hear that missileers ' felt driven to score 100 percent all the time ' because commanders use scores as the main , or only , factor in promotions			1
@entity316 called this " unhealthy			0
' she is weighing recommendations on ways to reform testing and training			0
but the newly released @entity33 documents show the focus on perfection should not be a surprise			0
one document that examined emergency war order test scores said , ' given the nature of the @entity140 crew mission , a perfect score is the expectation			0
' the pressure to be perfect apparently has driven some to cheat and others , possibly including commanders , to look the other way			0
there is no evidence that this has translated to unsafe handling of nuclear weapons duties , but an @entity33 review found ' a culture of toleration ' at @entity10 that ' allowed unprofessional and non-compliant behaviors			1
' it said launch crews had an " artificial sense of preparedness " for tests and inspections .			0

@entity10 air force base missile operators competency grades were actually below passing , but barely passed when averaged with other **employees**
those other **employees** included cooks and *janitors* - people who have no *interaction* with the nuclear missiles
these revelations came during hearings on a cheating scandal at the *maligned* facility
