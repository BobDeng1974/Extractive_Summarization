@entity1 hospitals have increased @entity3 training sessions as health workers are placed on high alert for potential cases of the deadly virus in the @entity1 at the @entity9 on monday , doctors practiced pulling on bulky white suits and helmets that make them look more like astronauts than doctors preparing to fight a deadly disease			1
however training sessions on @entity3 preparedness for @entity1 medics and health workers heading to @entity19 can make the reality sink in - learning how to safely put on and take off the medical armor is crucial			1
' when you 're in the real deal , remember to take your time , ' biosafety expert @entity26 told doctors during a course this week in @entity29			1
suits splashed with patients ' vomit or blood must be removed carefully , he explained			2
@entity1 hospitals are preparing for possible @entity3 patients ; the only one diagnosed so far in this country is being treated in @entity43 , while the outbreak in @entity19 has killed more than 3,400 people			1
@entity46 , of the @entity47 , left , and licensed clinician @entity48 , right , deliver simulation contaminated bags to a biohazard bin on monday in @entity52			2
the @entity47 has developed an introductory training course to make sure doctors who may provide medical care to patients with @entity3 have sufficient knowledge of the disease ' as much as possible , grab from the inside ' to avoid touching contaminated parts of the suits , he said			1
' be liberal with disinfectant			0
' looking stoic after this week 's training , dr @entity36 said he 's ' not overly worried , but i think there 's a legitimate concern ' that someone with @entity3 may arrive at the hospital 's door			2
an anesthesiologist , he 's among about 35 doctors and nurses who 've volunteered to treat any @entity3 patients who may show up at the @entity29 hospital			2
@entity36 said he volunteered because ' somebody has to do it , and i think it 's important to give care where there 's a need '			0
the @entity84 medical staffers get several hours of @entity3 training , plus refresher courses and videos in putting on and taking off protective gear			1
meanwhile , the @entity47 ( @entity47 ) this week started training volunteer health workers heading to @entity19 to help fight the epidemic			1
dr. @entity91 , an @entity92 emergency room doctor heading soon to @entity93 , was among students in a @entity47 training session monday in @entity96 , @entity52			1
@entity91 , who also works for the @entity47 , said breaches in health workers ' protective gear in @entity19 have contributed to @entity3 's spread			1
the @entity47 has increased @entity3 training courses across the @entity1 for doctors working in @entity1 hospitals and those who will soon be traveling to @entity19 ' you realize going through these exercises how easy that is , ' he said			1
' in @entity93 or @entity108 or @entity109 it 's going to be quite hot and humid			0
and some of the procedures , like placing an iv , you get pretty nervous with a patient that you know has a high viral load , ' he said			0
' then you get fogged up and you get anxious and you could start pulling at your ' equipment , which could be contaminated with virus			0
' so you have to mentally go through this a number of times and become well - versed			0
so it becomes a routine			0
' for @entity1 hospitals , the @entity47 has issued guidance on how to spot suspicious cases and isolate them if necessary , with an emphasis on the importance of asking patients about recent travel to the outbreak region , where more than 3,400 people have died from the disease			1
the lone @entity3 patient diagnosed in the @entity1 had traveled from @entity108 but was treated and released the first time he sought care			1
at first , the @entity137 hospital he went to said it did n't know about his travel ; it later said that information was provided and available to the medical staff caring for him			0
' it 's so easy to forget to ask about travel , ' said dr. @entity144 , director of a @entity9 infection control program			2
' that 's our one vulnerability			0
' dr @entity148 , left , and dr @entity149 learn how to perform a medical procedure on a patient mannequin while wearing protective gear during ebola preparedness training at the @entity9 on monday emergency room staffers are trained to focus on the most critical problem , like providing fast treatment for a heart attack or broken leg , she explained			1
if the same patient also has a fever and headache - common problems but also @entity3 symptoms - ' it 's hard to break that autopilot and say , '' oh , by the way , did you travel recently ? '' , @entity160 said			2
' we have to get them to break that autopilot every time			0
' across town , at @entity172 , doctors got a frightening test run this past weekend when a man coughing up blood said he had been in contact with someone from @entity179 , one of the countries in @entity19 where @entity3 spread			1
@entity183 staffers donned protective gear and immediately escorted him to a nearby isolation room , but tests showed he had bronchitis , not @entity3 , said dr. @entity190 , @entity192 's emergency medicine chief			0
@entity190 said he 's worked through similar scary disease threats - @entity194 , @entity195 , swine flu and smallpox after 9/11 - that were in some ways more worrisome because they can spread invisibly through the air			0
@entity3 is transmitted through direct contact with blood , vomit and other body fluids , or contact with needles , syringes or other objects contaminated by the virus			2
' at least with @entity3 we have a fighting chance , ' @entity190 said , ' because i know that it is coming from body fluid and i know if i wear my ( protective ) suit i 'm safe and i know if i do n't stick myself with a needle or cut myself with a scalpel i 'm safe			0
' ' there 's always going to be a little bit of fear in your head , ' @entity190 said			0
' but that 's ok			0
that 's what keeps us safe			0
' volunteers in protective suits bury a person who died from @entity3 in @entity228 , @entity108 on tuesday			2
