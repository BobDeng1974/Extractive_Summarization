by @entity0 published : 11:14 est , 14 march 2013 updated : 19:53 est , 14 march 2013 @entity3 's name has a ' toxic ' effect on voters when it is attached to the @entity7 ' economic strategy , a poll has found			1
the public largely backs the @entity10 's strategy to reduce the deficit and cut spending – until the policy is attributed to the chancellor himself , the survey suggests			1
when researchers from @entity18 asked voters if they agreed that deficit reduction should be the priority – the @entity10 's strategy – 52 per cent agreed			1
days before next week 's @entity23 , a new poll reveals voters are more supportive of the government 's economic plan until they find out @entity3 is the architect just 41 per cent backed kickstarting ' growth ' through increased spending and temporary tax cuts , a plan favoured by @entity31			2
however when voters were told mr @entity3 was the author of the policy to tackle the deficit , support for the strategy plunged to 37 per cent			1
even among conservative supporters , backing for the flagship deficit reduction policy dropped by five points when told it was mr @entity3 's idea			1
and when informed that @entity31 's @entity40 , shadow chancellor , was behind a separate argument for more spending , 53 per cent swung in behind the strategy , a lead of 16 points			2
pollsters questioned 1,009 voters between march 9 and 11			1
mr @entity3 has emerged as the least popular chancellor since the 1990s			1
the @entity18 / @entity18 survey showed how voters had different reactions to the two economic policies when they were told that mr @entity3 and @entity31 's @entity40 were responsible overall , @entity31 's poll lead has grown to 13 points since last year 's ' @entity23 where mr @entity3 had to ditch ill - conceived policies such as taxes on caravans and pasties			1
@entity31 has the support of 40 per cent and the @entity7 27 per cent , their lowest since january 2003			1
conservatives are privately warning that next @entity60 could be mr @entity3 's last as chancellor if he delivers a repeat of last year 's disaster			2
yesterday @entity65 , the @entity66 party chairman , tried to reprise the spirit of the @entity69 government , saying he wanted the @entity7 to be the party of enterprise and aspiration : ' i believe that at our best we are always on the side of people that work hard and get on in life			1
' only one in four ( 26 per cent ) think @entity40 and @entity80 would do a better job at managing the economy mr @entity3 is also coming under pressure from @entity66 mps to cut taxes – and a further extension of the fuel duty freeze is expected – while the @entity88 are calling for more spending to stimulate growth			1
mr @entity40 ' apparent popularity has surprised conservatives , who just this week were told by their campaigns guru @entity94 to try to exploit the tensions between him and leader @entity80			2
the poll yesterday found that most voters still blame @entity31 for the state of the economy			0
@entity100 has repeatedly targeted @entity31 's @entity40 in the belief that he is unpopular with voters because of his role under @entity104 @entity108 's political elite is a bunch of ' interested amateurs ' with little or no business experience who have ' generally never run anything ' , the @entity106 boss said yesterday			2
in a stinging attack , @entity114 , director general of the respected business lobby group , slammed the lack of corporate experience within the @entity119			0
mr @entity114 , a former @entity120 executive and entrepreneur , said : ' we have a political class in the tradition of the interested amateur			0
in many cases having little or no experience of business , and who have generally never run anything			0
' that ensures they are at the mercy of the mandarins of the civil service – just like the @entity138 emperors whose actions were constrained as they tried to rule			0
' @entity139 , the defence secretary , has two decades of business experience and @entity141 used to be the chief economist at @entity143			0
but the prime minister worked in public relations and chancellor @entity3 is a career politician			2
a @entity147 spokesman said : ' ministers across @entity149 speak to businesses every day of the week to understand how we can help them grow and succeed			0
' there is extensive business experience in the @entity119 , specifically amongst ministers in the @entity156 and @entity155			0
' and just one in four believe @entity31 would do a better job			0
pollsters said mr @entity3 's lack of popularity may not be personal , but down to the public blaming whoever is in power			0
@entity164 , of @entity18 , said : ' it is also true that @entity3 has the lowest rating of any chancellor since @entity168 back in the mid- 1990s			1
but then he probably does n't expect to be popular right now with the economy in the state it is , and the cuts continuing			0
' the economy is the number one issue for voters , ahead of immigration and @entity177			0
most are pessimistic , with only 18 per cent believing the economy will improve in the next year , while 48 per cent think it will get worse .			0

more than half of people support *coalition* 's priority to cut the deficit , *falling* to 37 **%** when told it is the chancellor 's policy
*osborne* the least popular chancellor since @entity168 in the early 1990s
support for the @entity7 *slumps* to 27 **%** - the lowest level for 10 years
but only 1 in 4 think @entity80 and @entity192 would do a better job
@entity18 interviewed 1,009 @entity108 *adults* by phone from march 9 to 11 .
