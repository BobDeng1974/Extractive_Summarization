by @entity0 published : 02:22 est , 24 august 2012 updated : 06:08 est , 25 august 2012 the earliest surviving portrait of @entity2 in @entity3			1
archaeologists are hoping to find his grave under a council car park in @entity7			2
it seems an unlikely resting place for a monarch			2
historians believe they have finally discovered where @entity2 is buried – under a council car park in @entity7			1
according to records , the last medieval king of @entity15 was buried in a @entity18 friary in the area after being killed by the army of @entity21 during the @entity22 in 1485			0
the friary was , however , knocked down during @entity25 ’s dissolution of the monasteries , and the exact location of the burial site has been one of @entity31 ’s enduring historical mysteries ever since			0
now , after closely examining ancient maps , archaeologists believe the most likely site for the church is a car park of a social services office in the centre of @entity7			2
yesterday , they began digging it up			0
@entity2 was @entity2 of @entity15 for two years , from 1483 until the @entity22			1
his death at the age of 32 marked the end of 30 years of civil war , known as the @entity44 , and the end of the middle ages			0
it also marked the dawn of the @entity21 dynasty and the demise of the @entity51			0
his clothes and armour were removed and his naked body carried on horseback to @entity7 , where the corpse was displayed in public for three days			0
he was then buried in the @entity18 friary , known as @entity58 , but just over 50 years later the church was destroyed			1
the archaeologists , from @entity78 , along with members of the @entity80 , hope finding the remains will help to change the way the monarch is viewed historically			1
@entity2 is traditionally seen as a tyrant who murdered his way to the throne , disfigured by a hunchback and a withered arm			1
@entity89 uses ground penetration radar ( @entity91 ) at @entity58 car park in @entity7 as the search for @entity94 remains gets underway in a field behind @entity97 near @entity7 , the treeline marks the spot where @entity2 is believed to have been killed in battle			1
the 69p stamp featuring @entity2 born in 1452 , @entity2 was @entity2 of @entity15 for two years , from 1483 until his death in 1485 during the @entity22			1
according to another tale , @entity2 consulted a seer in @entity7 before the battle who foretold that ' where your spur should strike on the ride into battle , your head shall be broken on the return '			1
on the ride into battle his spur struck the bridge stone of the @entity115 ; legend has it that , as his corpse was being carried from the battle over the back of a horse , his head struck the same stone and was broken @entity123 was the last @entity15 king to be killed in battle he was the last king of the @entity126 and the last of the @entity51 dynasty			0
although @entity2 has gone down in history as a monstrous tyrant with a hunchback and a withered arm , most historians now claim such an image is purely fictitious and down largely to how he was portrayed by @entity135			1
many historians , however , claim that a distorted image of the king was deliberately created by the @entity139 , the most notorious example of which is @entity135 ’s play about him			0
the @entity80 said it hoped the excavation , which is projected to last two weeks , would end ‘ the enormous disparagement ’ of his reputation			0
the site of the friary was bought by @entity148 @entity147 , the mayor of @entity7 , in 1612 , after the church was demolished in 1538			2
he built a mansion there			0
in 1914 , @entity152 bought the land , later turning it into a car park			0
archaeologists will start by digging two long trenches across the car park , hoping to find remains of the church and narrow down the search			1
they will also use ground - penetrating radar to find the best places to dig. @entity163 , co-director of the @entity164 at the university , said : ‘ it is quite a long shot but it ’s a very exciting project			0
we do n’t know precisely where the body would have been buried but we suspect it would be in the choir or near the altar			0
’ if bones are found they will be assessed for trauma to the skeleton			2
@entity2 was hacked down after being surrounded and one historical account suggests that the blow which finally felled him was so hard that fragments of his helmet were left in his skull			1
they will also be subjected to dna analysis			1
the remains will be matched against the @entity182 of @entity184 , a 16th generation descendant of @entity185 , the sister of @entity2 mrs @entity184 died four years ago , aged 82			1
at the site yesterday , mrs @entity184 ’s son @entity186 , 55 , watched as the search began			0
the furniture - maker , who was born in @entity191 but now lives in @entity192 , said his mother would have been thrilled by the project			0
‘ the family were entertained when she got the call several years ago from a historian claiming she was a descendant , ’ he added			0
the @entity198 , medieval silver - gilt livery badge of @entity2 , helped researchers pinpoint the location of the battle of @entity22 when is was found in east @entity202 in 1999 archaeologist dr @entity203 shows today how the badge of the boar led them to pinpoint the battlefield and where the king fell			1
' this is almost certainly from a knight in @entity2 's retinue , who rode with him to his death on that last charge , ' he said a flag and memorial stone mark @entity217 , just northwest of @entity218 memorial : the plaque at the place where @entity2 is believed to have been killed a depiction of the carnage during the @entity22 by 18th century painter @entity223 ( 1740 - 1812 ) the @entity22 was fought on the morning of august 22 , 1485 , and marked the end of the @entity44 , the 30 - year civil war between the houses of @entity126 and @entity227			1
one of the most important clashes in @entity15 history , it saw the death of @entity2 , ushered in the @entity21 dynasty and gave @entity135 one of his best known quotations			1
the leading role has been played by @entity236 and sir @entity237 , and the battle has also been immortalised in many artworks			0
the battle marked the final confrontation between the @entity126 king @entity2 and his challenger @entity21 , @entity244 and @entity245			1
the seeds of @entity2 's downfall were sown when he seized the throne from his 12 - year - old nephew @entity249 in 1483			2
support for the monarch was further diminished when @entity249 and his younger brother disappeared and @entity2 was involved in the death of his wife			2
@entity21 laid claim to the throne from across the @entity256			0
following an unsuccessful attempt to invade @entity15 from his base in @entity259 , @entity21 arrived on the coast of @entity261 on august 1 , 1485			0
gathering support as he marched inland , @entity2 hurriedly mustered troops and intercepted @entity21 's army south of @entity265 in @entity266			2
after @entity2 's death on the battlefield his rival was crowned @entity21 and became the first @entity15 monarch of the @entity21 dynasty , which lasted until 1603 .			2

@entity274 hopes to *uncover* the church of the @entity276 , known as @entity58
if remains are found , they will undergo dna analysis at the @entity78 to confirm that they are those of @entity2
