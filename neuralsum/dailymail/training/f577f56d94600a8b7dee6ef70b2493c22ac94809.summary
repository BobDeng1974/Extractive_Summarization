it is regarded as one of the world 's safest and most popular jets , which comes complete with a range of technologies designed to keep it in touch with air traffic controllers on the ground			1
fitted with an @entity12 flight transponder which , unlike the @entity13 in a car , broadcasts its location by sending information back to air traffic controllers every second , the @entity10 would appear to have the necessary technology to prevent it disappearing completely without a trace			1
yet early saturday morning , this is precisely what happened to @entity22 , as it made its way , 35,000 ft in the air , from @entity26 to @entity27			1
the service is being offered to 11,000 planes already equipped with an @entity31 satellite connection , stock image of a @entity10 cockpit is pictured			2
the firm claims the service will cover ' virtually 100 per cent of the world 's long haul commercial fleet ' the plane would also have been fitted with an indestructible black box recorder and a beacon to continue transmitting its location should it land in water the @entity43 @entity42 that disappeared from air traffic control screens saturday ( 2011 file picture ) the transponder on the plane , which is also fitted with an indestructible black box recorder and a beacon to continue transmitting its location should the aircraft land in water , should provide air traffic controllers on the ground with the aircraft 's speed , altitude and direction , according to @entity58 , of @entity59			1
but the signal from the transponder appears to have been lost at about 1.20am , without a change in altitude or course , which has suggested to some a sudden event caused the plane to crash			1
crews however are also able to speak to their airline through ' discrete radio channels ' , according to aviation expert @entity70 , writing on the @entity72 website			2
again , he argues the sudden end to all communication , without a distress signal , suggests a ' catastrophic failure of the aircraft '			1
he says : ' a complete electrical failure is extremely unlikely because of redundancies in the system , especially the ram air turbine which uses the power of the wind generated by the aircraft â€™s motion in flight to generate electricity which would power critical navigation and communication systems , as well as flight controls			1
' but even if the aircraft had a complete electrical failure , the aircraft could have continued to fly			1
' @entity95 's department civil aviation director general , @entity96 , pictured left , with @entity43 ceo @entity97 , pictured right , during a press conference on the new search area a cabin crew of @entity101 of the @entity102 is onboard a flying @entity103 - made an - 26 during the search operations he goes on to argue the plane could have eventually flown to an area where it would have been picked up again by radar , concluding it was ' too early to speculate ' on what has caused the disappearance			1
the long - range jumbo jet has helped connect cities at the far ends of the globe , with flights as long as 16 hours			2
but more impressive is its safety record : the first fatal crash in its 19 - year history only came last july when an @entity122 jet landed short of the runway in @entity124			0
three of the 307 people aboard died			0
airlines like the plane because it is capable of flying extremely long distances thanks to two giant engines			0
each engine is so massive that a row of at least five coach seats could fit inside it			0
by having just two engines , the plane burns through less fuel than four - engine jets , like the @entity139 , which it has essentially replaced			0
' it has provided a new standard in both efficiency and safety , ' said @entity145 , an aviation consultant with the @entity146			0
an @entity147 is used to support orientation by a military official inside a @entity151 @entity102 plane during search and rescue operations for the missing @entity43 flight @entity151 military personnel prepare a helicopter for a search and rescue mission for the missing @entity43 flight ' @entity158 has enjoyed one of the safest records of any jetliner built			1
' besides last year 's @entity122 crash , the only other serious incident with the 777 came in january 2008 when a @entity165 jet landed about 1,000 feet short of the runway at @entity168 's @entity167			2
@entity43 did have an incident in august 2005 with a 777 flying from @entity171 , @entity172 , to @entity26 , @entity95 's largest city			2
while flying 38,000 feet above the @entity175 , the plane 's software incorrectly measured speed and acceleration , causing the plane to suddenly shoot up 3,000 feet			2
the pilot disengaged the autopilot and descended and landed safely back in @entity171			0
a software update was quickly made on planes around the world			0
@entity43 has 15 @entity10 777 - 200er jets in its fleet of about 100 planes			0
the first was delivered on april 23 , 1997 , and the most recent on december 13 , 2004 , according to @entity10			0
the @entity187 is one of four versions of the 777 .			0

@entity192 's transponder should provide information to air traffic controllers
but at around 1.20am on saturday , transponder on flight @entity22 appears to have stopped working
experts say loss of communication suggests ' catastrophic failure '
but it is ' too early to speculate ' on what caused the disappearance
