@entity3 , 50 , developed post-traumatic stress disorder ( @entity12 ) after dislocating her knee on the bus home from work in 2008			1
paramedics were 17 minutes late in reaching her			1
mrs @entity3 argued that the extreme pain she was in and the length of the wait meant she developed the condition which left her suffering flashbacks , nightmares , a high level of anxiety and depression , and seizures			1
today a judge sitting at @entity31 's @entity30 awarded her £ 522,379 after she was forced to retire from her job as exhibitions organiser at the museum			1
mrs @entity3 said spent a total of 50 minutes trapped between seats on the bus @entity39 station in extreme pain			1
fellow passengers tried to help and had to hold her down in order to stop her moving			2
mrs @entity3 said she could not sit or stand and was screaming in agony			2
every additional minute added to the trauma of her experience until she felt ' utter despair '			2
mrs @entity3 said she felt trapped , was shaking violently , became unable to hold her mind together , remembered ' no longer knowing who she was ' and went ' into a freeze '			1
eventually paramedics arrived , treated her with painkiller and manipulated the leg back into place , but by then the long - term damage was done			2
she did not recover full function in the knee for about 18 months and became housebound			0
mrs @entity3 was forced to take medical retirement from the job she loved in 2011 after she began to suffer from dissociative seizures , which cause her body to go numb and collapse			1
she appeared at the @entity30 via webcam to save her the trauma of travelling from her new home in @entity66 , but the stress was enough to cause a seizure during cross-examination			2
mrs @entity3 suffered the dislocated knee after getting on a bus near wimbledon station			1
as a result of her delayed treatment she developed ptsd which meant she had to quit her job after suffering seizures the judge said : ' she has continuing ptsd which flashbacks , nightmares and dissociative seizures			1
' in the flashbacks , she finds herself back on the bus experiencing the pain and anxiety she felt at the time			2
' the nightmares occur nightly , breaking her sleep pattern and leaving her exhausted			0
' the dissociative seizures unexpectedly cause her body to go numb and she collapses			0
she suffers a collapse most days			0
' she remains conscious but feels nothing and is unable to move or speak			0
' she is unable to travel outside on her own			0
when she goes outside with a family member , she may suddenly collapse in the street			0
' she find it difficult to concentrate , plan and action ordinary activities such as housework and mentally tends to go round and round in circles			0
' while the ambulance service agreed that paramedics had been late to arrive at the scene , they disputed that the trauma of having to wait caused the ptsd , and disagreed over the level of compensation			0
their lawyers said that , during 2010 and 2011 , she had other stresses including problems with marital communications , worry about whether her husband would be made redundant , financial problems , her son ’s trans - gender issues , her daughter ’s issues about her adoption and the pressures of litigation			0
mrs @entity3 worked at the @entity8 until her seizures forced her to take medical retirement the judge disagreed and said that the delay made a ' material contribution ' to the development of her ptsd			1
he added : ' there are innumerable variables in the circumstances that will give rise to the development of such a disorder and in the people who are likely to suffer it			0
' it is impossible to predict on any scientific or mathematical basis the moment after which someone will go on to suffer it			0
' he said he was satisfied that the seizures were all part of the ptsd and consequent upon it and were not related to other stresses in her life			0
the judge said he had no hesitation in accepting that mrs @entity3 ’s injury was severe as all aspects of her life were badly affected and additional therapy was expected to make only a minimal improvement .			1
