there is an image of @entity2 and @entity3 deep in conversation during a @entity6 training session that did the rounds on social media a few years ago			1
@entity2 was @entity10 ’s assistant at @entity6 and @entity3 was in his final years as a player at the @entity12 at the time			1
the picture became the perfect ‘ guess the caption ’ competition the best one having @entity3 say to @entity2 : ‘ i ’ll be @entity6 coach one day and i ’ll win the treble ’ and @entity2 replying : ‘ yeah right , and i ’ll manage @entity18			2
’ @entity2 and @entity3 in deep conversation following a @entity6 training session no sooner had @entity21 joined @entity6 at the start of this season and the photo libraries threw up an even better shot – one of @entity21 , @entity3 and @entity2 in their time at @entity6			2
then the archive scanners began to notice something about some of the other faces in the pictures from this era – is n’t that current @entity35 coach @entity34 ? and is n’t that current @entity37 coach @entity36 ? and are n’t four of the coaches of the last eight in this season ’s @entity40 from the same club at the same time ? ( from l - r ) @entity6 's @entity43 , @entity21 , @entity2 and @entity3 at training @entity34 comes up against @entity21 at the @entity45 on wednesday in the @entity40 @entity34 was a huge part of the @entity47 that won the @entity48 under @entity10 in 1996 @entity21 comes face to with @entity34 in the @entity45 stadium on wednesday night and both will have plenty to catch up on			1
they were both in the @entity6 team that started the 1996 - 97 season by winning the @entity48 against @entity56 6 - 4 on aggregate			0
with @entity10 in charge and @entity2 ’s assisting him the team that won the first silverware of the new season included not just the @entity63 @entity62 winner and the 62 - times @entity65 international and the aforementioned @entity36 and @entity3 but @entity66 , who started the season as @entity69 coach ; @entity70 , who is now coaching @entity71 in @entity65 ’s second tier ; and @entity73 , who has just taken over at @entity74			2
the @entity47 that won the @entity48 under @entity10 in 1996 is breeding managers @entity3 takes on former @entity6 team - mate @entity36 who is currently @entity37 manager @entity66 , seen battling @entity76 for the ball , went on to coach @entity79 side @entity69 @entity10 and @entity81 defender @entity80 celebrate victory against @entity83 also in the team were @entity80 who has coached @entity85 and @entity86 among others and @entity88 , who managed @entity89 last season and is now at @entity91 in @entity92			1
even those players from that team who never went on to manage have stayed in football with @entity96 now working as a scout for @entity98 and @entity99 a former director of @entity6 ’s youth academy who is now director of football at @entity102			0
among the squad players that season were @entity106 and @entity107 now coach with @entity108 and @entity110 ’s under - 17s teams respectively			0
former @entity6 1996 squad player @entity36 is currently manager of @entity113 giants @entity37 @entity114 ( left ) and @entity115 both went on to manager @entity117 clubs @entity21 travels to @entity119 to take on @entity34 's @entity35 side at the @entity45 in the @entity40 ahead of his meeting with @entity34 on wednesday , @entity21 crossed swords with old friend and former team - mate @entity73 two weeks ago when @entity6 played @entity74			1
“ it was the last thing we looked like becoming , ” he said when i asked the @entity6 manager if both he and @entity73 had looked like coaches - in - waiting in their playing days			2
“ you change the way you look at things once you retire			0
” @entity21 believes those who played in positions where they had the pitch in front of them for most of the game – the full - backs , the centre - backs , @entity3 in holding midfield – went on to coach in part because of how tactically astute they had had to become to be successful in their positions as players			0
former @entity149 striker @entity88 went on to manage @entity89 and is now in @entity92 @entity36 : @entity37 boss @entity66 : former @entity69 coach @entity152 : jailed for money laundering @entity70 : sporting @entity71 coach @entity34 : @entity35 boss @entity21 : @entity6 manager @entity73 : @entity74 coach @entity99 : @entity102 sporting director @entity3 : @entity160 coach @entity80 : former @entity86 and @entity85 coach @entity88 : former @entity89 boss now at @entity91 in @entity92 @entity163 : former @entity71 director at @entity6 @entity66 : former @entity69 boss @entity115 : @entity167 manager @entity168 : no coaching roles @entity170 : former @entity172 boss @entity3 : @entity160 coach @entity174 : coached at @entity175 and @entity176 @entity114 : former @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180 coach @entity43 : coaching role at @entity182 @entity183 : television pundit @entity80 : former @entity86 and @entity85 coach it ’s perhaps more of a surprise that so many attacking players also graduated to the technical area			1
some will have got jobs because they played for @entity6 rather than because of all they learned at @entity6 – it ’s the irresistible pull of giving a @entity6 old boy a job in the hope he will be able to build a side in his former team ’s image			0
but for every failure there has been a success and there is a 50 per cent chance that whoever wins this season ’s @entity40 , via the coach , @entity6 ’s prints will be on the trophy .			0
