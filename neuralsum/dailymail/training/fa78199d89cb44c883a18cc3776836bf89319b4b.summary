gaffe : president @entity1 has been criticised after referring to the ' @entity2 in @entity3 when it is of course @entity5 just a few weeks ago , @entity1 hailed the ' extraordinarily special relationship ' between @entity7 and @entity8			1
but it is clearly one he does n't know all that much about if his latest foreign policy gaffe is anything to go by			2
the @entity7 president has come under fire today after referring to the ' @entity14 ' instead of the @entity15 in his condemnation of the violence that broke out at the building in @entity19 yesterday			1
a frenzied mob of militant @entity19 students ransacked the main embassy in @entity3 and a smaller diplomatic compound in the city			2
they lobbed petrol bombs , stole classified documents , torched the @entity29 flag and even tore up a portrait of the @entity31			0
the rioters also chanted ' death to @entity14 ' and threw rocks			0
one man held up a @entity29 flag with a skull and cross bones on it			0
in an interview yesterday , mr @entity1 said : ' all of us are deeply disturbed by the , err , crashing of , err , the @entity42 , err , the embassy of the @entity5			1
' by calling it the ' embassy of the @entity5 ' , he got it wrong a second time			1
it appears there has never been an @entity42 , although there have been @entity14 ambassadors centuries ago			0
@entity61 , a blogger on @entity62 who led the criticism , said : ' in case the president is unaware , @entity14 forms part of @entity8 , which also includes @entity67 and @entity68 , though not @entity69 , which is part of the @entity5			1
' one can only imagine the kind of howls of derision that would greet any presidential contender if that kind of basic error were made before , say , the editorial board of the @entity79			0
' it would be nice if the leader of the free world bothered to look at a map once in a while			0
' @entity85 today demanded the immediate closure of the @entity87 in @entity88 and ordered all its staff to leave the country in retaliation for the attack on the embassy in @entity3			2
@entity94 : protesters carry the royal coat of arms after breaking into the @entity5 embassy yesterday			1
others tore up a portrait of the queen and chanted ' death to @entity14 ' the foreign secretary has given the @entity19 diplomats just 48 hours to get out of the @entity5 , he told the @entity105 today			1
mr @entity1 's outrage over the events in @entity3 are welcome , but the blunder is sure to raise questions about his approach to the ' special relationship ' which has been considerably downgraded since the days of @entity112 and @entity113			2
it is not the first time mr @entity1 has slipped up on his geography , either			2
just two weeks ago , he mistakenly referred to @entity116 , his birthplace , as being in @entity117 during a press conference on the island			1
and he is n't alone among @entity7 politicians in his geographical blunders			0
former @entity123 governor @entity122 once said the @entity7 had to ' stand with our @entity125 allies ' when in fact she meant @entity128			0
former @entity7 president @entity113 was also left red - faced when he referred to @entity129 as a nation rather than a continent .			0

surely he knows it 's the @entity15
gets it wrong a second time by calling it ' the embassy of the @entity5 '
second gaffe this month after saying @entity116 is in @entity117
