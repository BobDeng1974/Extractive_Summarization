i now have to convince the officials not to put buckets of drinks around me			0
’ @entity32 appeals for a foul but is booked for diving , a decision that led to @entity5 's reaction the two managers are restrained by match officials who try desperately to keep them away from each other as the pair locked horns @entity4 makes sure he gets his point across by bellowing in @entity5 's direction @entity5 's side were lucky to escape with a point and will be fined £ 25,000 by the @entity0 after six of their players were booked , including @entity62 who picked up a two - game ban following his 10th yellow of the season			1

it was n’t “ have a nice evening , @entity4 ”			1
‘ but i do n’t know why i reacted like that			0
we all do stupid things but it was handbags			0
‘ i thank the assistant referee for stepping in			2
i ’ll have to buy him a beer			0
‘ i just think @entity5 had seen it differently about @entity32 diving			1
but the referee got it right			2
‘ all i said to his assistant was that @entity32 had dived			0
‘ these things happen in the heat of the moment			0
grown men acting like a couple of children			0
