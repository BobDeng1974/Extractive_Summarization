by @entity0 published : 10:42 est , 7 march 2013 updated : 08:06 est , 11 march 2013 mrs @entity1 said plans to close a children 's heart surgery at @entity5 were unfair and legally flawed a high court judge has derailed controversial plans to close a children ’s heart surgery unit because of the ‘ secretive ’ approach of @entity12 chiefs			1
there were scenes of jubilation after the decision to move heart surgery for children from the centre at @entity5 ruled @entity5 as part of a national reorganisation was unfair and legally flawed			1
the @entity12 announced last july it wanted to close three units and keep seven open , with some patients in @entity24 being forced to travel to @entity25 or @entity26 for treatment			1
but mrs justice @entity28 backed claims by the @entity31 ( @entity33 ) group that the consultation process to decide which units should be axed was unfair because details of how a panel of experts marked individual hospitals were kept secret			1
the judge will announce crucial decisions about what happens next at a further court hearing later this month			2
@entity46 from @entity33 said despite winning the case ‘ on every point ’ , the ruling did not necessarily mean the @entity50 heart unit was saved			2
there is huge support for keeping child heart surgery in the region and nearly 600,000 people signed a petition against closure of the unit			2
‘ the campaign started small , like @entity61 , then grew and grew out of all proportions , ’ she said			0
the group spokeswoman slammed the review process conducted by the @entity65 of @entity66 ( @entity67 ) as being ‘ secretive			1
’ miss @entity46 said : ‘ it was important the process had transparency and openness and they failed in our opinion			1
winning this case in the @entity76 proves once and for all that the supposed consultation was a rubber - stamping exercise conducted with an outcome in mind , with clinicians , mps and patients fooled into feeling they had influence			1
‘ this action was taken by parents and clinicians who simply could not stand by and watch a clear injustice being done			0
’ during the national review each hospital unit was visited by a panel of experts and given a performance mark			1
the panel produced ‘ sub-scores ’ which gave marks for a wide range of criteria , but these were n’t disclosed to the hospital units lobbying to stay open until after the final decision was made			1
@entity101 , @entity102 , for @entity103 , successfully argued the centres were ‘ shooting in the dark ’ during the consultation process as they had no idea of how they were being viewed			1
health bosses wanted to close the unit at @entity5 ( pictured ) , meaning patients in @entity24 would be forced to travel to @entity25 or @entity26 for treatment the @entity67 also ended up ‘ assessing in the dark ’ as it refused to look at the sub-scores when making its decision and only took account of the total mark			1
mrs @entity1 said in her ruling : ‘ as the scores were relevant to the assessment , the breakdown of the scoring should have been disclosed to the centres whether or not the @entity67 proposed to look at it			1
’ @entity67 chairman sir @entity125 said later he hoped the court would not quash the @entity12 review ‘ in its entirety			0
’ he said : ‘ the pressing need to reform children ’s heart services is long overdue and experts have cautioned that further delay in achieving the necessary change would be a major setback in improving outcomes for children with heart disease			0
‘ the judgment focuses on a single matter of process , but the case for the reconfiguration of children ’s heart surgical services remains strong			2
’ sir @entity146 , chair of the @entity65 of @entity66 said : “ i am very disappointed with the @entity76 ’s decision			2
the pressing need to reform children ’s heart services is long overdue and experts have cautioned that further delay in achieving the necessary change would be a major setback in improving outcomes for children with heart disease			0
' the judgment focuses on a single matter of process , but the case for the reconfiguration of children ’s heart surgical services remains strong			2
there is a rare consensus on the need for change right across the board – @entity12 staff , medical royal colleges , professional associations and national charities all support the case for fewer larger surgical centres , new national quality standards and stronger networks of care			0
' professor @entity170 , chairman of the @entity171 , said : ' @entity172 recognised that the @entity173 and sustainable review concluded that fewer larger surgical centres and the development of local networks of care will improve cardiac services for children based on the evidence of their review of the evidence linking volume of cases to outcomes			0
@entity187 remains a matter of urgency – it is 12 years since the report of the @entity192 was published and patients have waited too long for improvements to be made			0
' following a series of reviews over the past decade @entity12 chiefs decided to concentrate the specialist services in fewer but larger centres that would give a higher quality of care for child heart patients			0
the sites currently chosen to stay open are at @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity206 and two @entity208 centres			0
facing closure are the @entity50 site and units at @entity213 ’s @entity212 and @entity208 ’s @entity214			0
the archbishop of @entity216 , dr @entity215 , yesterday welcomed the ruling and said earmarking the @entity50 unit for closure was ‘ utterly unjustified and unethical			0
’ he said the evidence must be looked at properly : ‘ we can not afford to rush and make a bodge job of this			0

decision to close centre at @entity5 ruled as ' legally flawed '
mrs @entity1 *agreed* that decision - making process was unfair
details of how an expert panel marked individual hospitals were kept secret
but decision does not mean hospital is definitely safe , warn campaigners
