with its front wall slipping into the garden , and its crumbling interior open to the elements , it looks like a disaster waiting to happen			0
but this derelict house has become a treasured feature of a seaside town after an artist transformed it into a unique art by making it look like the facade has slipped into the front garden			1
part of the upper floor of the four - storey property is exposed as curving bricks , windows and a door below give the illusion that the front of the house is sliding away			1

' i wanted to create something that captured humour , illusion and would be accessible to people from all types of different backgrounds			0
the response has been very positive			0
' last year , mr @entity32 installed more than 1,200 pieces of glass across the facade of a factory in @entity55 to create the illusion that its 312 windows had been identically smashed and cracked			2
