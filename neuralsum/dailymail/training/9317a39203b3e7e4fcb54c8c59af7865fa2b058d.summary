@entity0 is confident he can stabilise @entity1 before sending the @entity2 soaring towards the top end of the @entity4			1
@entity0 has returned to management at the @entity6 , eight months after he was sacked by @entity7			2
the 56 - year - old has signed a three - and - a - half - year deal to succeed @entity10 , who has left him a squad firmly embroiled in a relegation battle			1
@entity0 has been named as the new manager of @entity4 side @entity1 @entity0 has joined the south coast club on a three - and - a - half year contract @entity0 becomes the fifth black manager across the 92 clubs in the professional football leagues , joining : 1			1
@entity25 , @entity26 @entity1 are out of the drop zone on goal difference , after taking four useful points from two games under caretaker boss @entity31			2
@entity1 have been play - off semi-finalists for each of the past two seasons , firstly under @entity34 and then @entity35			1
achieving that feat for a third straight year will almost certainly be beyond @entity0 , but getting back in the play - off frame is the eventual aim for the former @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 full - back			1
' i want to get this club back challenging in the top six again , ' said @entity0			1
' with the infrastructure and everything that is in place here , that has to be the aim			0
@entity0 was sacked as @entity7 manager towards the end of last season @entity10 resigned as manager of @entity1 on december 22 after a dismal start to the season ' but that is further down the line			1
if i look at our position in the league , first we have to try and get some stability in the results , move us into a more comfortable position and then progress from there			0
' as soon as i knew there was an opportunity to come here it was one that very much excited me			0
the infrastructure and where this club wants to be in the future was an important factor			2
you only have to look at the brand new training facility and stadium that 's here to see the club 's ambition			2
' over the past few years they have fared very well in the division and been very close to realising their ambitions in the last couple of seasons			0
for whatever reason this season has not gone so well , but one of the key factors in me deciding to join the club was the ambition and the calibre of staff here already			0
' the initial challenge is obvious , we need to improve our league position			0
but we are working to get this club back challenging at the top end of the division			0
the @entity4 's bottom six , showing @entity1 just above the relegation zone @entity0 takes charge of @entity1 with the club one place above the relegation zone virtue of goal difference ' hopefully that wo n't take too long as i know the squad quite well and i have come across some of the players over the previous few seasons			1
i 'm also familiar with the structure and some of the staff here at the club , so i hope that it is not going to take me too long to settle in			0
' @entity0 thanked @entity31 for the job he did on an interim basis for the past couple of games - a 2 - 2 home draw with @entity121 and a 2 - 0 victory at @entity123 - and confirmed that he will remain part of his staff			1
' @entity31 will very much be part of my first - team coaching staff and he has done a fantastic job here , ' said @entity0			2
' i 'm particularly grateful for the last two results and as somebody from the outside with a keen interest looking in , i was hoping that the last two results would fare well and he has done very well			0
' i have a lot of respect for him as an individual and also as a coach , so i 'm delighted to have him on board			0
' @entity1 's first match following @entity0 's appointment sees them travel to @entity41 in the @entity145 third round on saturday .			1
