controversial : @entity0 says doctors should have the right to kill newborn babies because they are disabled , too expensive or simply unwanted by their mothers an academic with links to @entity7 has received death threats after claiming that killing newborn babies is no different to aborting them because they are not ‘ actual persons ’			1
dr @entity0 said that the days since her paper was published in a medical journal have been ‘ the worst in my life			1
’ she said she has received a series of hate messages claiming she would ‘ burn in hell ’			2
in her paper in the @entity18 , dr @entity0 , who is based at the @entity21 but is also a research associate at @entity7 , suggested that killing newborn babies was no different from abortion			1
the article , titled ‘ after - birth abortion : why should the baby live ? ’ was written by her and @entity28 of the @entity29			1
the paper suggests newborn babies are not ‘ actual persons ’ and do not have a ‘ moral right to life ’ because they ‘ lack those properties that justify the attribution of a right to live of an individual			1
’ after receiving death threats and angry messages , she asked for people to understand the perspective of her work			2
‘ this is not a political paper - this is not a proposal for law , ’ she told the website ninemsn			2
‘ this is pure academic , theoretical discussion			2
’ in her article she says that ‘ both a foetus and a newborn certainly are human beings and potential persons , but neither is a “ person ” in the sense of a “ subject of a moral right to life			1
” ’ she adds : ‘ we take “ person ” to mean an individual who is capable of attributing to her own existence some ( at least ) basic value such that being deprived of this existence represents a loss to her			0
’ dr @entity0 and her research colleague continue : ‘ what we call “ after - birth abortion ” ( killing a newborn ) should be permissible in all the cases where abortion is , including cases where the newborn is not disabled			1
' right to decide : dr @entity0 argues a young baby is not a real person and so killing it in the first days after birth is little different to aborting it in the womb as the hate calls came in , dr @entity0 told the website that she had not been expecting the overwhelmingly negative reaction			1
she said she believes her argument was taken out of its academic and theoretical context			0
‘ i wish i could explain to people it is not a policy , and i ’m not suggesting that and i ’m not encouraging that ’			0
she believes the majority of threats have come from religious or pro-life groups			0
some of the hate messages told her that she would be punished by @entity96 , while others suggested she should ‘ burn in hell ’			1
professor @entity99 , editor of the journal , said arguments about killing newborns were ‘ largely not new ’			1
he said the goal of the journal was to ‘ present well - reasoned argument based on widely accepted premises			0
’ @entity107 : ' a compelling reason to stop late - term abortions ' rev @entity107 , an opponent of late abortions , said what the ethicists had proposed was little more than infanticide			1
the female vicar first came to public attention when she spoke out against a late abortion that had been carried out in 2001			1
doctors are permitted to carry out abortions beyond the 24 - week legal limit if they believe a baby 's disability is serious enough , but @entity107 argued that a cleft palate was a minor physical flaw , not a severe abnormality			1
she revealed that , until she had surgery at the age of 19 , her own face was disfigured by a congenital defect			0
her upper jaw overhung her lower jaw , which receded into her neck			0
she posed the question : ' would it have been right to abort me ? ' she said : ' it 's misleading to call this ' after birth abortion '			1
the pregnancy is already over , there is nothing to abort			0
what is being discussed is infanticide			1
' there is a logic to their point - if we consider it acceptable to abort a baby up until birth then why not allow it to die afterwards ? it is just a difference in geography - within or outside the mother 's body			1
' of course , i would see this a compelling reason to abolish late - term abortion , if infanticide is morally repulsive then abortion is too			1
' if a baby , because of it 's physical disabilities , is seen as being " incompatible with life " then we need to let life and death take its course			1
becoming agents of death fundamentally changes doctor 's role as healer and physician , and it also has massive repercussions on society 's conscience shifting what is understood to be morally and socially unacceptable to become acceptable			1
of course motherhood is inconvenient , physically , emotionally , psychologically , financially - but this inconvenience is not allowed to become acceptable grounds for abandoning one 's child			0
' if a child or an adult has a life - changing accident or illness , do we suggest we 'll put them down because their goals and dreams now have to change ? ' my brother , @entity192 , has great and huge goals and he goes after them with great courage			1
his @entity196 does not stand in the way			0
' they are very different dreams and goals to my own but no less valuable or of contribution to society			0
at what level would dr @entity0 assign somebody 's meaning and value to be worth a life ? @entity207 : @entity208 in @entity209 while infanticide may seem an inhumane concept for many people , there have been periods in history where it has been accepted behaviour - and even a legal obligation			1
in @entity220 culture , disabled infants were often abandoned after birth by parents who did not want or could not afford the financial burden			2
the child would simply be left outside to die from starvation and the elements in a practice known as ' exposure '			0
it was an established and acceptable procedure			0
in 1912 , @entity230 ( right ) was excavated in @entity231 in @entity209 , and researchers were shocked to find the bodies of 97 babies in a mass - grave			0
the babies had apparently all been killed shortly after birth , and the prevailing theory is that the site was near a brothel			0
with a lack of contraception in @entity220 , unwanted pregnancies would likely have been much more common , and the mass grave is another example that infanticide did not pose such an ethical dilemma in that era			2
archaeologists believe @entity220 did not consider infants to be ' full ' human beings until about the age of two , and babies who died before that age were not buried in cemeteries , but instead in public or domestic areas			0
however a @entity220 couple were entitled to raise a disabled child			0
in @entity260 , there was little choice in the matter			0
newborns were seen as the property of the state and all babies were inspected by a community leader			0
if the child showed signs of deformity or ill - health , the parents were ordered to expose it			0
many parents in ancient @entity275 would also expose their newborns because of sickness , financial pressure , or simply for being the ' wrong ' sex in the male - dominated society			0
many religions had did not raise moral objects to infanticide , although @entity284 and @entity285 notably rejected it			2
leaving the child to the elements was the preferred method to ' dispose ' of the child , because it meant the child died of natural causes , which was a more ' moral ' death than directly killing the child			2
the practice generally died out , and was outlawed in the last years of the @entity297			0
however there are references to infanticide in many cultures in every historical era , and is believed to still take place in certain parts of @entity305 , @entity306 , and @entity307			2
@entity307 's controversial ' one - child ' policy leads to many children being abandoned after birth			0
@entity311 , a lecturer in medical ethics and former chairman of the @entity314 , described the viewpoint as ‘ chilling ’			2
@entity316 , of the @entity317 , said every life is precious and added : ‘ everybody talks about what women want but women would n’t want this			2
’ @entity324 , chairman of the @entity325 on pro-life , told the @entity327 : ‘ it is profoundly disturbing , indeed shocking , to see the way in which opinion - formers within the medical profession have ditched the professional belief of the healer to uphold the sanctity of human life for this impoverished and inhumane defence of child destruction			1
’ @entity338 , the journal ’s editor , said that the article ’s argument has been made before by eminent figures			0
he added : ‘ i ’m not defending practising infanticide			2
i ’m defending academic and intellectual freedom			0
’ he said that dr @entity0 has a ‘ loose relationship ’ with @entity7 and her main position is at the @entity21			1
struggling mother : the ethicists are also in favour of the infanticide of a healthy baby when the woman 's circumstances have changed and she no longer has the time , money or energy to care for it			1

*philosopher* and medical ethicist @entity0 argues that killing a newborn is little different to aborting it in the womb
even a healthy baby could have its life *snuffed* out if the mother decides she ca *n't* afford to look after it , dr @entity0 suggested
*anti-abortion* vicar : ' if infanticide is morally repulsive , then abortion is too '
