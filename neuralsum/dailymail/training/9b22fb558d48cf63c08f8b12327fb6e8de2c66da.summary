when an elderly woman fell down an escalator at a bustling train station , you might have expected rail staff to rush to her aid			1
but astonishingly , they refused to help her			2
and their reason ? they had not been trained in ‘ people - handling ’			1
the extraordinary excuse was given by @entity13 workers , who stood just yards away and let other passengers tend to the shocked woman instead			1
a witness , who confronted the staff at @entity19 train station , described their attitude as ‘ shameful ’			1
going up : rail staff refused to help an elderly woman after she fell down an escalator at bustling @entity19 station @entity25 , 25 , said he was waiting for a train at around 10.30am when he spotted an ‘ old lady fall backwards ’ while travelling up an escalator			1
he said one passenger ‘ grabbed her ’ and another stopped the escalator by pressing an emergency button			0
‘ a third called the @entity13 staff to help but they just stood there like lemons , ’ he said			1
mr @entity25 , a scientist working in the road industry , added : ‘ i dashed up the escalator – she was in a very precarious position			0
afterwards i asked [ the staff ] why they did n’t help and they said they were n’t allowed to because they were n’t “ people - handling trained ”			1
‘ i said it was shameful behaviour			0
’ @entity13 runs passenger trains across the north of @entity49 and is the largest train operator in the @entity51			2
this week it introduced peak evening fares – meaning some weekday tickets will cost 117 per cent more			0
scene : the extraordinary excuse given by the @entity13 workers , who let other passengers tend to the shocked woman at @entity19 train station ( pictured ) , was that they had not been trained in ‘ people - handling ’ mr @entity25 , from @entity61 , @entity62 , said the two @entity13 staff were standing at the ticket barrier , about 20 yards away , in full view of the escalator			1
‘ after speaking to them i thought they were just misinformed staff so i gave the customer service line a call and they repeated the same line to me – that they ’re not allowed to help because they ’re not people - handling trained			1
it seemed to be against common human compassion			0
’ he added : ‘ i said to them “ if your granny fell over would you not hope that someone would pick her up ? ” they did n’t answer			0
’ after the incident last week , @entity84 and two female passengers helped the elderly woman to a bench before comforting her and getting her a drink			2
the woman , who was left shaken but is not believed to have been injured , has not been identified			0
last night the train company put the incident down to policy concerning the use of staff trained in first aid			2
a @entity13 spokesman said : ‘ we ’re sorry for any distress caused to the lady who fell or other customers who witnessed what happened			2
our team report any accident directly to the station managers so a qualified first aider can be alerted immediately			0
’ but @entity109 , head of operations for the @entity111 in @entity62 and the @entity112 , said it was a ‘ ridiculous ’ situation , adding : ‘ there nothing in the @entity116 that prevents people offering assistance to others in distress			0
‘ i can only think that either the company ’s own policies are being stretched and misinterpreted by their employees , or the individuals in question did n’t fancy getting involved and they just used health and safety as a convenient excuse			0
