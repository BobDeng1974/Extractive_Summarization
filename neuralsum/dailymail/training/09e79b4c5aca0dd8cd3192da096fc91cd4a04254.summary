by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 : she was abducted six years ago in @entity3 @entity5 is to take control of the @entity8 case from the @entity3 authorities , the @entity4 can reveal			1
in a significant development , home secretary @entity10 has agreed to fund a full - scale @entity13 investigation into @entity2 ’s disappearance in @entity3 six years ago			1
it follows a two - year , £ 5million @entity13 review of her disappearance			1
this has identified more than 20 potential suspects and dozens of new leads – but despite the progress made by the review team , the @entity3 authorities have refused to reopen their inquiry			1
officials in @entity3 say that under the country ’s laws they can only reopen the case if there is new evidence , and the new leads do not provide sufficient grounds			1
but @entity13 detectives insist their leads could , if properly investigated , result in new evidence and perhaps the case being solved			1
with no sign of the deadlock being broken , the @entity13 asked mrs may to provide @entity38 funding for a @entity5 investigation into @entity41 ’s disappearance			2
it is understood she has approved the request			0
it is not known how much additional funding was sought but it is believed it could run into millions of pounds			0
a statement announcing the @entity13 - led investigation is expected in the next few weeks			1
it will endeavour not to upset the @entity3 authorities , who – privately at least – are likely to be unhappy about playing second fiddle to @entity52 police			1
under the plan , @entity5 detectives will seek the assistance of the @entity3 to carry out some inquiries on their behalf			2
@entity52 police do not have jurisdiction in @entity3 but they have the right to investigate and prosecute any @entity52 suspects who might be linked to @entity2 ’s disappearance			2
taking over : @entity5 is to take control of the @entity8 case from the @entity3 authorities partnership : it is understood that @entity5 would ask @entity3 authorities to put any suspect on trial sources said that should @entity5 gather sufficient evidence to prosecute a foreign national who lives overseas , they will ask the @entity3 authorities to put the suspect on trial			1
@entity2 was nearly four when she went missing from her family ’s holiday apartment in @entity75 on the @entity76 in 2007 as her parents dined with friends nearby			0
the shambolic @entity3 inquiry was shelved in 2008 but @entity5 began a @entity38 - funded review in 2011 following the intervention of @entity82			1
he had been lobbied by @entity2 ’s parents , @entity85 and @entity86 – who were falsely accused by @entity3 police of being behind her disappearance			2
officials said the progress made by the @entity5 review vindicated mr @entity82 ’s decision to intervene			0
a review by the @entity13 police identified 20 potential suspects and dozens of new leads into the disappearance of @entity8 last year the officer in day - to - day charge of the review , detective chief inspector @entity98 , said his team had identified 195 potential leads			1
it emerged last month that the review had identified more than 20 people ‘ of interest ’ , including @entity52 , who have not been eliminated from the case			2
detective chief superintendent @entity109 , who supervised the @entity13 ’s review said there were a ‘ good number ’ of individuals who should be questioned			0
well - placed sources said at least 20 potential suspects – including a number of @entity52 who were in the @entity76 at the time of @entity2 ’s disappearance – had not been properly eliminated			1
one authoritative source said last night : ‘ these people include a couple of known child sex offenders who are thought may have been in the @entity76 when @entity2 disappeared			0
more work needs to be done on establishing their movements around the time she vanished			0
it can not be disputed that the @entity3 police investigation was very poor			2
‘ they put all their eggs in one basket in terms of the @entity131 being responsible for @entity2 ’s disappearance			0
when they were rightly eliminated , they simply closed the inquiry rather than starting again			0
’ it is understood that , contrary to some media reports , the @entity3 inquiry did identify everyone who was staying at the @entity137 when she vanished			2
the @entity5 is ‘ tidying ’ up this aspect of the initial inquiry , trying to nail down people ’s movements there			0
the fact that so many investigative opportunities were missed has galvanised @entity52 detectives who believe there is a real possibility they could unravel the mystery			0
last month , the @entity4 revealed how as part of the review , @entity5 detectives had flown to @entity153 to probe the movements of one of the country ’s most notorious child snatchers , @entity155			0
the 67 - year - old was one of many potential suspects dismissed prematurely by @entity3 police			1
@entity161 kidnapped and murdered a five - year - old girl in his native @entity153 less than three months after @entity2 was abducted			0
he took his own life after killing his victim , who looked remarkably like @entity41 .			0
