by @entity0 eating plenty of fresh fruit , vegetables and whole grains helps prevent people from developing more than one chronic disease , new medical research shows			1
the world - first research conducted by the @entity10 examined the link between diet and 11 chronic diseases , including anemia , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , diabetes , arthritis , hepatitis , coronary heart disease , asthma , stroke , fracture and cancer			1
it found that people who eat a higher amount of fruit are less likely to develop any chronic disease , while a high intake of vegetables helps prevent people with one chronic disease from developing a second			1
scroll down to see video people who eat a higher amount of fruit are less likely to develop any chronic disease , new research from the @entity10 shows the study , done in conjunction with universities and health organisations in @entity45 and @entity46 , is published in the @entity48 journal			1
healthier people eat more grains other than wheat and rice ¿ such as oats , corn , sorghum , rye , barley , millet and quinoa while links between good diet and disease prevention are well established , this is the first study that had linked poor nutrition to the development of multiple chronic diseases , otherwise known as ' multimorbidity '			1
the researchers studied more than 1000 @entity45 people over a five - year period			0
study co-author dr @entity71 said the participants who did not develop any chronic disease ate on average 57 grams of fruit per day – a relatively small amount by @entity77 standards			2
' @entity45 consumption of fruit is quite low , but even when low you can see the benefits , ' dr @entity71 told @entity83			0
dr @entity71 added that rice intake was significantly lower in the healthy group			0
' this could be because rice is mainly refined and deprived of the benefits associated with fibres , and the kinds of phytochemicals that you find in whole grains , ' he said			0
the research also found that healthier participants ate more grains other than wheat and rice – such as oats , corn , sorghum , rye , barley , millet and quinoa			2
the world - first research examined the link between diet and 11 chronic diseases , including anemia , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , diabetes , arthritis , hepatitis , coronary heart disease , asthma , stroke , fracture and cancer dr @entity71 said these grains were less likely to be refined and are therefore likely to contain more dietary fibre			1
' if you look at the intake of whole grains , the highest intake of whole grains is among those who stay healthy over five years , ' dr @entity71 said			0
the study highlighted the role of micronutrients in protecting against disease			0
' a higher daily intake of iron , magnesium , phosphorous , vitamin c , potassium and vitamin b1 was associated with healthier participants , ' dr @entity71 said			0
this is the first study that had linked poor nutrition to the development of multiple chronic diseases , otherwise known as ' multimorbidity '			2

people who eat lots of fruit are less likely to develop any chronic disease
high intake of vegetables helps prevent multiple chronic diseases
healthier people eat lots of different grains , not just wheat and rice
