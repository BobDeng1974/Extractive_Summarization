' so began the first volume of a journal written in 1832 by @entity9 of @entity10 , aged 13			1
it was a diary that the young royal - later to become @entity13 and ruler of the @entity15 - would continue to add to until her death in 1901			1
and now , her great - great - granddaughter @entity13 has launched a website documenting @entity9 's life in her own words			1
the monarch was handed a remote control in @entity23 ’s throne room yesterday , which she pointed at a screen to officially launch the website , @entity25 - but revealed she had no plans to publish her own diaries			1
the site contains 40,000 pages of the surviving volumes of @entity32 's journals , along with sketches and paintings she drew to illustrate them			1

she wrote the passage as they travelled through @entity62			2
her mother , the @entity64 , and her @entity65 , @entity66 , wanted her to keep the diary to aid her education - that she might write well and observe what she saw			2
the @entity70 , @entity71 at @entity72 and online publisher @entity73 scanned the pages - some in @entity9 ’s own hand and some edited and then transcribed by her daughter @entity76 after her death - for the six - month project , carried out to mark the @entity79			1
when asked by bodleian librarian @entity80 if she herself wrote a diary , the @entity13 , wearing a summery floral printed dress , replied to laughter from those gathered to mark the launch : ' mine ’s not being published '			1
dr @entity88 said afterwards that she ' could n’t resist ' asking the @entity13 about her own journals , having been a part of the project			1
she added that it was ' an amazing honour ' to work on the journals			0
she said : ' we have been motivated by the intrinsic value of these collections and the idea of sharing them			0
the site contains 40,000 pages of the surviving volumes of @entity32 's journals , along with sketches and paintings she drew to illustrate them			1

' this is a part of history			0
it is such an exciting moment , when you can unlock history and make it publicly available			0
' the eyes of the world are focused on the @entity13 and the @entity79 - and this is the other @entity79			1
' in her diary , @entity9 wrote of the scenes that greeted her during a parade to mark her own 60 - year reign : ' passed through dense crowds , who gave me a most enthusiastic reception			1
it was like a triumphal entry			0
' we passed down @entity152 , under a lovely arch bearing the motto , " our hearts thy @entity156 "			0
' the streets were beautifully decorated , also the balconies of the houses with flowers , flags , and draperies of every hue ... the streets , the windows , the roofs of the houses , were one mass of beaming faces , and the cheers never ceased			0
' writing on the website , launched alongside a @entity174 account providing extracts from the journals , the @entity13 said : ' in this the year of my @entity79 , i am delighted to be able to present , for the first time , the complete online collection of @entity13 @entity9 ’s journals from the @entity70			1

' thirteen volumes in @entity32 ’s own hand survive , and the majority of the remaining volumes were transcribed after @entity13 @entity9 ’s death by her youngest daughter , princess @entity76 , on her mother ’s instructions			1
' it seems fitting that the subject of the first major public release of material from the @entity70 is queen @entity32 , who was the first monarch to celebrate a @entity79			1
' the @entity13 took a particular interest in a drawing of @entity32 ’s wedding head dress when shown the original pages from the diaries today			1
the launch was timed to coincide with the 193rd anniversary of @entity32 ’s birth today			1
she would perhaps have been interested in how the documents are now available on the internet - as she wrote , again on the occasion of her @entity79 , of sending a message electronically			2
she wrote : ' i touched an electric button , by which i started a message which was telegraphed throughout the whole @entity15			0

' she also writes at length of her love for @entity197 , describing her wedding day on february 10 1840 : ' @entity197 repeated everything very distinctly			0
i felt so happy when the ring was put on , and by my precious @entity197			0
' above , the pair in may 1854 over the years , @entity9 became a keen diarist , extensively documenting details of both public and private life			2
she underlined important words or phrases two or even three times , and liberally used exclamation marks			0
her daughter , princess @entity76 , spent 40 years transcribing the journals covering the period 1837 to 1901 - a total of 111 volumes			2
@entity9 instructed her to modify the text , taking out parts that could offend other members of the family and other sections not suitable for publication			2
the originals were destroyed , in accordance with @entity32 ’s wishes			1
other key events detailed in the diary include @entity32 ’s coronation , her entry for that day reading that she was woken by guns in a nearby park at 4am and then could not sleep because of the noise of the crowds gathered outside			1
she wrote : ' there were millions of my loyal subjects assembled in every spot to witness the procession			0
their good humour and excessive loyalty was beyond everything			0
' i really can not say how proud i feel to be the queen of such a nation			0

felt as if living in a dreadful dream			0
' @entity313 , senior archivist at the @entity70 , said she had learned a lot about @entity32 while working on the project			2
' she ’s a natural writer , and a natural painter , ” she said			0
' she had a way with words and a way with her pen			0
it ’s very exciting to see all this coming together			0
' the @entity174 account @ @entity324 will be active during the jubilee period			0
