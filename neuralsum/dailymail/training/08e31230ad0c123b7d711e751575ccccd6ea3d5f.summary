the rolling countryside of @entity5 beloved by poet and novelist @entity8 will be ' devastated ' if plans to build a dozen wind turbines there go ahead , angry residents have claimed			1
the @entity9 has condemned proposals to erect two wind farms close to locations the author wrote into his best - known works , saying they will blight the beautiful countryside that attracts crowds of tourists each year			1
the proposed sites for the 400ft turbines are between the villages of @entity21 and @entity22 , close to where both @entity23 were set , and at @entity25 , not far from the tiny village of @entity27 where @entity8 was born and where his heart is buried			1
residents in the west @entity5 countryside celebrated by @entity8 are fighting plans for two wind farms developers want to build five turbines between @entity22 and @entity21 , referred to by @entity8 as @entity35 , and a further seven in the village of @entity25 , near @entity37 , a key setting in @entity8 's short story @entity40			1
@entity25 is also down the road from @entity42 , where @entity8 set @entity43			1
@entity8 set his novels and poems in the @entity47 countryside where two wind farms are planned the @entity21 / @entity22 site is flanked by @entity49 , the inspiration for fictional @entity51 in @entity52			1
a star - studded film adaptation of one of @entity8 's most celebrated works is currently being shot and is due out next year			0
fans of the @entity58 author fear the turbines will blight the heart of @entity8 's @entity47 and put tourists off visiting the landscape so intimately described by him			1
@entity63 , owner of @entity49 , said : ' in @entity52 , @entity52 walks across the countryside from @entity42 to @entity65 right through the proposed sites			1
' he would have had quite a shock if he had to walk past two wind farms			2
' in fact , @entity8 would probably be able to see these wind turbines from his final resting place at @entity27			2
' @entity72 , chairman of the @entity9 , said : ' the sites are simply awful places to put these wind turbines			2
the locations are very much in the heart of @entity77			0
up to seven wind turbines are proposed for this site at @entity25 , just outside @entity42 where @entity8 worked this map shows the @entity25 site , where up to seven turbines are planned , and the @entity84 farm site wild countryside : this picture shows the land chosen for a proposed wind farm near @entity21 in west @entity5 ' it is a relatively unspoiled area of downland and the last place something like a wind farm should go			1
' a lot of tourism in @entity5 is thanks to @entity8 , and if you destroy these landscapes there will be nothing left for people to see			2
' people visit west @entity5 because of the relatively unspoilt countryside and the fact that @entity8 described it so intimately in his fiction and poetry			2
' to just go and stick up these turbines at these location would be terrible			0
' the plot of land for the @entity21 / @entity22 wind farm lies near @entity49 and is the setting of one of @entity8 's best known short stories , @entity114			2
angry : opponents gather at the @entity21 wind farm site , near landscape immortalised by @entity8 ' devastating ' : @entity118 lives at @entity37 , which featured in @entity8 's 1882 short story @entity40 the turbines will be visible from much of @entity121 , which featured in the author 's 1878 novel @entity122			1
@entity124 lives at @entity37 , a @entity125 manor house at @entity25 which was home to the @entity127 in @entity8 's 1889 short story @entity128			0
he said : ' these proposals are completely misplaced			0
to put them here would completely spoil @entity8 's beautiful countryside			2
' not only would it drive down the price of houses round here , but it would also have a huge effect on @entity5 's number one industry - tourism			0
' these turbines could be devastatingly damaging			0
' the two wind farms are being planned by two separate energy firms , @entity140 , which is behind the @entity21 / @entity22 site , and @entity142 , which has drawn up the @entity25 proposal			1
the @entity25 site is close to @entity42 , setting of @entity8 's @entity43 - this still is from the television adaption starring @entity148 as @entity43 and @entity149 as @entity150 @entity151 , pictured , starred in the 1967 film of @entity8 's @entity52 , set in @entity47 @entity153 , of @entity142 , said : ' it is inevitable that any wind farm will introduce change into an area			1
' certainly @entity8 is an important figure in the history of our country but that does not necessarily mean you ca n't integrate new elements into the landscape			0
' it is all about managing change in the right way			0
it is widely known that we need new ways of generating electricity in this country , and onshore wind power is a fast , cheap way of doing that			0
' @entity140 previously submitted plans for nine turbines to the local council but withdrew them last week while they went back to the drawing board following protests			0
@entity182 , from @entity140 , said : ' following a review of the various statutory and other consultee responses and after discussions with @entity187 , we have decided to withdraw the planning application			0
' this will enable consideration to be given to the concerns raised and to thesubmission of a new revised scheme for the site			0

five turbines proposed for @entity21 in @entity5 and a *maximum* of seven for @entity25
sites are near beautiful locations chosen by @entity8 for his novels
the @entity58 author set @entity122 near @entity21 and @entity43 was set in @entity42 , near @entity25
residents say the wind farms will blight countryside and put off tourists
