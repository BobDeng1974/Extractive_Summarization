by @entity0 @entity1 is one of a growing number of @entity3 traveling overseas to receive controversial stem cell transplant treatments in a desperate attempt to stop the disease that was ravaging her body , @entity1 booked a flight to @entity9 and forked out $ 40,000 to receive risky stem cell transplant treatment			1
the 36 - year - old mother - of - two , who was diagnosed with @entity12 early last year , is now leading the way for a growing number of @entity3 who are n't prepared to wait for medical trials to be approved in @entity3			1
after suffering from constant bone pain , pins and needles and cognitive dysfunction before finally being hospitalized and unable to walk for four days , @entity1 says she is now completely cured and is in the process of directing 80 other @entity3 with @entity12 through the same treatment			1
' it just hit me when i was in hospital			0
i was in there for four days because i was n't able to walk properly and i was just feeling so miserable and i realised that this is going to be the rest of my life - not working , not being able to be a mum , ' @entity1 told the @entity31			1
' before i went to @entity32 , i really could n't be a mum			0
i could n't take them anywhere alone , i could n't pick them up and drop them off at school most of the time ' , the heartbroken mum revealed			0
' the dialogue they constantly heard was " mummy is too tired , mummy does n't feel very well " , so i was n't present , i just was n't an active mother in their lives			2
the disease exhibits itself in random episodes or attacks , where patients may lose function of parts of their body for certain periods of time			0
however in the majority of @entity12 sufferers , the disease continues to progress over time , deteriorating their body slowly			2
according to dr @entity79 , a senior staff specialist in hematology at @entity82 's hospital in @entity83 , there is no cure for @entity12 , but various treatments are available to suppress the frequency of such attacks			2
dr @entity79 is also the principle investigator of a phase two study into stem cell transplantation in auto immune diseases at @entity82 's , where only nine patients have been given the treatment - all with positive results			1
there is no cure for @entity12 , and although studies into the benefits of stem cell therapy for the disease continue around the world , it has not yet been approved in @entity3 @entity1 spent five weeks in @entity9 undergoing the treatment which involved intensive chemo therapy and her stem cells being drawn out of her body and filtered before being replaced similar research has been conducted around the world since 1996 , with many country 's offering the procedure for high fees			1
but the treatments have not yet been approved in @entity3 due to ethical reasons			1
' we could do it here – we could set it up in a private hospital but we do n't think that it 's ethical , ' dr @entity79 said			0
' it definitely works , but we do n't know which patients it works best with and we do n't know if it 's better than the current standard treatment			0
dr @entity79 , the principle investigator of a study into the treatment in auto immune diseases at @entity82 's , said the procedure is incredibly risky ' this is not a simple procedure			2
it is a risky procedure and there is a risk of dying from complications			0
' despite begging dr @entity79 over the phone for hours , @entity1 was told she would not be accepted for treatment under the @entity3 study			1
' it 's very hard to qualify and i knew i might have to spend years and year jumping through hoops trying to qualify while i grew more disabled , ' she said			0
' the hardest part for me is financial			0
i was n't too concerned about going overseas generally speaking , but financial it is difficult because by going overseas i 've saved the @entity3 government about $ 100,000 a year – drugs for my @entity12 would have costed $ 60,000 a year , plus neurologist appointments and not to mention the disability support pension			1
' i 've saved the @entity3 government over a million dollars throughout my lifetime easily , and i 'm being denied access to my own super to pay for it , so from a financial point of view it ’s a real travesty			2
' but it has all been worth it , according to the former emergency nurse , with the symptoms being completely cleared after just five weeks in @entity9			1
before leaving to @entity9 constantly felt debilitating fatigue and vertigo , had cognitive issues and memory loss , the left side of her body was often numb and random attacks left her unable to walk for days pictured here with her husband @entity166 , @entity1 says she has had a complete recovery and no longer suffers from the same symptoms she is now completely mobile , her cognitive fog has lifted and she runs up to five kilometres a day ' before i left , i was feeling debilitating fatigue , i had constant vertigo , i was having cognitive issues memory loss , confusion , i had a numb left side of my body , the sensation of bugs crawling around my head and shoulders , ' @entity1 said			1
' when i left home , depending on the day , i had to use a wheelchair or a walking aid just because i would get out of my car at the supermarket and be so fatigued that i 'd have to go straight back home			2
' now , i 've had 100 per cent improvement			0
the cognitive fog has lifted , i 'm 100 percent mobile - i regularly do five kilometre runs - it felt like i was back in the body i had 10 years ago			0
' the process involved four days of injections that would draw the stem cells which normally sit inside the bone marrow , into the blood stream			0
then , @entity1 spent eight hours lying flat while the stem cells were drawn out of her blood stream			2
after four days of high intensity chemo therapy , the stem cells were transplanted back into her body			0
after her stem cells ( pictured ) were placed back in her body , @entity1 spent 10 days in isolation while her immune system rebuilt itself : ' my immune system was down to zero which means that a simple cold could kill you , ' she said mr @entity79 described the process as ' growing a new immune system ' and said it is the most risky process of the procedure as the patient 's immune system has been suppressed			2
' my immune system was down to zero which means that a simple cold could kill you , ' @entity1 said			0
she thus spent 10 days in isolation while her immune system rebuilt itself , however it will take at least six months in total			0
now , the active mother spends her days inspiring others through her success story			0
she works about 50 hours a week , not for profit , traveling around the country and giving talks about her experience			0
she has also been supporting 80 other @entity3 with @entity12 to undertake the same @entity222 procedure overseas , and is currently working as an interpreter for her former @entity32 doctor			1
' i am now on a mission to raise awareness of the treatment option for all the @entity3 suffering from @entity12 , ' she said			1
now , @entity1 ( pictured beside a @entity32 doctor ) travels around the country talking about her experience she has been supporting 80 other @entity3 with @entity12 to undertake the same @entity222 procedure overseas and is seen here giving a talk to them at the @entity231 in april ' dozens of @entity12 patients are being effectively cured of their disease each month around the world , we just need to fight for the right to received hsct in @entity3			1
' in the meantime , the studies and trials may be some time away from releasing definitive results for the treatment in other types of diseases			0
' we are going to join a trial , that has started in the @entity248 , comparing stem cell transplants to the best available @entity12 treatments and that trial will take about three years to complete and then another year to follow up , ' dr @entity79 said			1
' but by then we will have a better idea of where @entity12 stem cell transplants could fit into peoples treatments and which patients will best benefit			1
' for the full story of @entity3 with various diseases choosing stem cell treatments , watch @entity261 on tuesday july 15 at 8:30pm aest			1
