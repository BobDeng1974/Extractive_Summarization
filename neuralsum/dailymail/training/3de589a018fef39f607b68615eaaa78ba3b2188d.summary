by @entity0 last updated at 10:49 pm on 3rd february 2012 a new study of @entity3 trends shows that a reliance on a small but highly active group of users may prove costly for the company as it prepares to go public			1
@entity8 reports that only 20 - 30 per cent of @entity3 's 843 million users are deemed ' power users ' , the most active on the social networking site			1
this figure comes as @entity3 begins the process of trying to convince investors that their users ' brand loyalty will amount to large financial gains , and is expecting a $ 100billion evaluation when initial public offering is set			1
the vast majority of activity on @entity3 comes from a minority of its users who are much more dedicated than others the research collected by @entity8 suggests that its users are not suffering from ' @entity3 fatigue ' , but rather the opposite : the emotional connection that users have with the network encourage them to keep coming back to the site			2
this finding is strategically important for the company this week as they finally started the process of becoming a publicly traded company			1
even though users do seem to be happy on the site , there is undoubtedly a constant fear that their biggest base may leave			0
if those ' power users ' were to leave the leading social network , that could pose major problems for the company because of the vast amount of activity that would flee with them			0
data from the @entity8 power users made their presence on the site known by tagging photos , sending friend requests , and ' liking ' their peers ' activities			0
on wednesday , @entity3 took the first formal steps in the process to set an initial public offering price , and said that they hoped for $ 5billion of stock			1
industry analysts see this as an effort to start the push low as the stock is expected to eventually value at $ 100billion			1
given the fluidity of technology trends , the fear of a hot new start - up is a constant one for @entity3 , but the researchers at @entity8 seem to think that users ' emotional connection with the site will keep them logging in for years to come			2
the study focused on user demographics , and found that female users are far more active than their male friends			0
female users made 21 updates - which could be any form of noticeable activity like sending requests , commenting on other posts , or posting their own material - per month , while their average male counterpart only made 6 updates in the same amount of time			0
the research suggests that it is n't just the fun of clicking away that has captured users ' attention for the eight years since it was created			0
it 's the feeling they get in doing so			0
@entity3 provides a self - esteem boost because of the positive emotional connotations that users remember from seeing their friends and interacting with them online			2
happy head : @entity101 , who created the social networking giant , is bound to make billions off the ipo @entity3 itself has taken an active role in promoting positive thoughts instead of negative ones as well , by choosing to only offer ' like ' buttons on posts and they have resisted calls for the introduction of a ' dislike ' button - similar to the one seen on @entity115 videos			2
' you keep getting all these wonderful positive rewards , ' @entity116 , the study 's author , told @entity120			0
those warm , fuzzy feelings that @entity3 invokes may be the key to their brand loyalty strategy , which mr @entity116 suggests is working since the user base only continues to expand as the years go on			1
' that 's pretty hard to give up			0
for most people , the longer they are on @entity3 , the more they do on @entity3 , ' he continued			2
@entity129 : @entity3 staffers , including @entity101 ( center , just below the text ) thanked its users as the ipo process formally began on wednesday when they filed the first paperwork			1

@entity3 began formal process of becoming a publicly traded company this week and are expecting a total valuation of $ 100billion
depending on brand loyalty to entice investors
