by @entity1 reporter published : 16:25 est , 8 january 2014 updated : 18:27 est , 8 january 2014 @entity4 's 1923 racist manifesto @entity3 consistently tops lists of bestselling ebooks and a new essay suggests that 's become of its similarities to @entity10			1
@entity11 argues that @entity4 's argument outlining a worldwide @entity14 conspiracy , which sees little in the way of hardcopy sales , is perfect for the more discrete and disposable world of digital books			1
like erotica and romance novels , writes @entity11 , readers who would otherwise be embarrassed may anonymously buy a copy of the text and stay under the radar while using an e-reader			2
strange parallel : a recent essay suggests that the years - long popularity of @entity4 's @entity3 is akin to the success of erotica and romance ebooks taboo subjects : there are many digital @entity36 translation versions of @entity4 's racist manifesto			1
one was recently on top of @entity40 's best selling @entity39			1
others versions continuously hover on other @entity40 and @entity43 bestseller lists one version of the manifesto tops @entity40 's list of most downloaded @entity39 books			1
two others hovered on the @entity50 list			0
' @entity3 could be following a similar trend to that of smut and romance novels , ' @entity11 writes , which may both ' be quietly perused then dropped into a folder or deleted			2
' the success of @entity10 , which accounted for nearly half of all book sales in 2012 , may be an extreme example , the logic seems clear			0
while @entity3 is n't as popular as the @entity64 novel , it is much cheaper			0
while an @entity43 copy of @entity10 costs $ 4.99 , a @entity67 edition of @entity3 -- which translates to @entity68 -- can be had for just 99 cents			1
according to @entity11 , @entity70 's electronic success has been worldwide and follows its hardcover popularity in @entity72 , where it has sold 100,000 copies since 2005			2
in 2005 , he writes , a @entity76 translation sold that many copies in just two months			0
whether hardcover or ebook edition , @entity11 suggests it is curiosity about a taboo book that is at the core of the books continued sales			0
while generally derided as the ravings of a genocidal anti-semite , @entity3 retains its appeal for some because of its historical importance			0
as an ebook , readers are apparently able to inulge their curiosity without having to keep the taboo tome on a shelf or be seen reading it in public			0

writer @entity11 argues the racist tome 's popularity is akin to that of @entity10
@entity3 has been on top @entity43 and @entity40 downloads lists for years
