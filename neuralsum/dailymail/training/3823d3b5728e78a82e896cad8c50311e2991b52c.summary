@entity0 , the payday loan company , has been required to write off £ 220million of debts for 330,000 customers			1
the @entity4 ( @entity4 ) has taken action because @entity0 had been granting loans to customers without checking that they could afford the repayments			1
back in june , the same company admitted to sending fake letters from fictitious law firms to customers in arrears , attempting to frighten them into repaying debts			1
for this cruel deception they paid £ 2.6m in compensation			2
now these are not the actions of a commercially acceptable enterprise			2
rather , they are the squalid manipulations of legalised loan sharks , whose profits are plundered from the distressed and the desperate			1
and this is the company whose name continues to disfigure the shirt of @entity30			2
@entity30 's shirt , as worn by midfielder @entity31 , features the logo of payday loan company @entity0 the point has been made repeatedly , not least in these pages , that the presence in football of these chancers , with their annual interest rates of up to 5,853 per cent , demeans not only the club , but the game itself			1
yet when the matter is raised with contacts at the club , the responses are recited like a familiar script : ‘ they ’re not doing anything illegal … their money ’s as good as any - one ’s ... £ 32m over four years is too much to turn down			2
’ the @entity30 owner , @entity54 , feels no need to explain this or any of his decisions ; indeed , one imagines him staring at the bottom line and smiling at the fuss			2
then there is his manager , @entity61			2
when the @entity0 deal was signed , precisely two years ago , @entity61 greeted it with the pollyanna enthusiasm of a born company man			1
‘ now there ’s no reason why we ca n’t be one of the top - four clubs , ’ he boasted			0
‘ i listened to the owner ( of @entity0 ) and their customer satisfaction levels are higher than any other bank or lending facility … when @entity0 have been involved in football clubs they ’ve been very successful			1
if our fans do have any concerns , maybe they should contact @entity80 supporters and see how they ’ve done			0
the feeling i get is that @entity80 fans have been happy with @entity0 and what they ’ve done for the club			1
’ it was almost too easy to snigger at his crass misjudgment			0
@entity61 cited @entity80 as evidence of the benefits that legalised loan sharks can bring to football			1
in this case , it appeared to involve a cheque of undisclosed proportions and a half – time competition which featured a giant @entity0 logo hanging from the goal in front of the @entity101			1
@entity30 owner @entity54 ( right ) talks with managing director @entity102 at the @entity103 a lucky fan was invited to walk out on to ‘ the hallowed @entity106 turf ’ and strike a football through the ‘ o ’ of @entity0			1
@entity109 brought him a £ 150 prize			0
unfortunately , most people missed this pantomime , since they preferred to go off for a cup of tea and complain about the first half			0
the last time i looked , one bookmaker was offering odds of 1 - 20 on for poor old @entity80 to be relegated to @entity120			0
i was up there for a pre – season game , and i must tell the starry - eyed @entity61 that the fans were deeply unhappy with just about every aspect of their car - crash of a football club			2
if anybody uttered a word in praise of @entity0 , then i missed it			1
for they understood exactly what attracts such a company to a sadly down - at - heel seaside town			2
and @entity30 fans , in the heart of the recession - plagued @entity136 , are similarly aware of the cynical strategy			0
where there is poverty and stark insecurity , there is @entity0			1
now it is clearly asking too much for men such as @entity54 or @entity146 , the singularly charmless chairman of @entity80 , to recant , remove that objectionable shirt logo , renounce their ill - considered contracts , return the fees and face the consequences			0
had they harboured the smallest scrap of sensitivity , then they would never have entered into such shameless agreements			0
but we are surely entitled to ask those who are charged with running the game to take a more civilised view			0
@entity30 manager @entity61 raises a smile as he arrives ahead of the match against @entity162 it is not an unreasonable request			0
the @entity170 chairman @entity169 , the @entity166 chief executive @entity165 and the @entity168 chairman @entity167 should jointly announce that payday loan firms should no longer be allowed to advertise their services through the sponsorship of shirts			1
they should point out that they are taking such action because of the damage to football ’s image and the danger to football ’s customers			1
and if they need moral and legal bases for their action , then they may find them in the closely - argued pages of the @entity4 report , which demonstrates their repugnant methods and their insatiable greed			0
the case has been made			0
it is time that football took its stand against the sharks			1
racism is never a joke , @entity200 by his own eccentric standards , @entity202 ’s season has been admirably restrained			1
declining to court controversy or seek a cheap headline , he has obeyed the ancient cliché and let @entity208 ’s football do the talking			1
but we sensed it was too good to last and , sure enough , he has broken cover with his assertion that ‘ there is no racism in football ’			1
@entity202 had been asked about the wisdom of the @entity219 game adopting a version of @entity222 ’s ‘ @entity221 ’ , which decrees that at least one black or ethnic minority candidate must be interviewed for every managerial post			1
he insisted that : ‘ football is not so stupid to close doors to people			2
if you are good , you get the job			0
if you are top , you are top			0
’ now it is perfectly possible for people of open minds and good intentions to differ about the desirability of the @entity221			0
but the notion that football is immune from the virus of racism is flagrantly absurd			1
racism exists in the police , the media and in both houses of @entity242			2
it exists in the @entity244 , the @entity245 and in every branch of the @entity247			0
mercifully , it is far less widespread and its manifestations far less odious than once they were			0
but excavate the dark corners of our society and the evidence will be exposed			0
@entity208 manager @entity202 speaks during a press conference on friday ahead of the @entity258 match in any case , we can not dismiss that deeply depressing statistic which tells us that while our 92 @entity263 and @entity168 clubs contain 25 per cent black players , only two have black managers			1
we can do much more to achieve decent , equitable , appropriate representation			0
an intelligent man like @entity202 is surely aware of this			1
we must therefore conclude that he is merely being mischievous			0
he has chosen the wrong subject and the wrong moment for his little jape			0
time to revert to restraint			0
all hail @entity274 ’s glorious triumph in a weekend of a reckless @entity276 and a breathless @entity277 , the deeds of @entity274 scarcely raised a flutter			1
which was a great pity			0
because the 30 - year - old @entity280 completed the @entity281 in 2hrs , 2min and 57sec , thus becoming the first man to go beneath 2hrs 3min for the distance			1
imagine that : 26.2 miles at an average pace of around 4min 41.5sec per mile ! it is beyond astonishing			0
@entity280 's @entity274 gives the thumbs up after breaking the world record for the marathon in @entity291 @entity274 took a full 26 seconds off the previous record			1
thirty years ago this month , the @entity294 @entity293 set a fine world record of 2.08.05			1
@entity274 would have left him almost a mile - and - a - half adrift			1
it is , of course , impossible to quantify			0
but as a measure of athletic excellence , i would suggest that it stands alongside @entity302 ’s first sub- 4 - minute mile or the various world records set by @entity304			2
@entity274 raises his arm as he crosses the finish line during the 41st @entity281 last sunday ‘ i went to @entity291 just to compete , but i thank @entity308 that i have come back as a world record holder , ’ he said			1
‘ it was a surprise			0
’ it was much more than that			0
it was a glorious triumph of human endeavour			1
we shall count ourselves fortunate to see anything comparable in this sporting year			0
@entity317 … @entity318 — the eminent linguist , professional provocateur and midfield scuffler — has been out of the public eye			2
and @entity318 hates to be ignored			2
so he decided to offer some unsolicited advice			0
@entity318 knows why @entity258 have n’t won the title for ten years			1
the @entity258 manager does n’t like ‘ warriors ’ , it seems			2
he ca n’t stand ‘ shouters and bawlers ’			0
and the result : ‘ at the latter stages of a season they come unstuck because of that lack of — i hate to say it — a real lack of character or spine within the team			1
’ it was vintage @entity318 , more in sorrow than in anger			2
you just know that @entity325 will be truly thankful			0
@entity318 during his appearance on @entity346 earlier this year			2

@entity0 had been granting loans to customers without checking that they could afford the repayments
the payday loan company admitted in june to sending fake letters from fictitious law firms to customers in arrears
these are the squalid manipulations of legalised loan sharks
payday loan firms should no longer be allowed to advertise their services through the sponsorship of shirts
@entity208 boss @entity202 asserted ' there is no racism in football '
the notion that football is immune from the virus of racism is flagrantly absurd
@entity274 's world record at the @entity281 was a glorious triumph of human endeavour
@entity318 said @entity258 have a ' real lack of character or spine '
