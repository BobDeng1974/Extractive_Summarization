now miss @entity6 's mother , @entity13 , has alleged that her landlord took her daughter 's belongings within hours of her vanishing			2
â€˜ he removed baby toys that her sister got her			1
the only reason i can assume he wanted them is because he thought they were valuable , they 're handmade			0
honestly , those were the items that upset me the most , the baby things			2
' miss @entity6 , who is five months pregnant , left her sister 's house to help her ex-boyfriend @entity41 whose car had broken down on @entity42 , near the eastern shore of the island			1
her abandoned and torched vehicle was found in a dirt track a few days later , along with some of her belongings , but there 's still no trace of her			1

abandoned : miss @entity6 's car was found burnt out and on its side several days after her disappearance mystery : miss @entity6 's burned out car was found in a remote area near the home of her ex-boyfriend a team of 50 to 70 volunteers and family members have been searching for @entity75 since her mother reported her missing			1
in an exclusive interview with @entity96 last week @entity41 said : ' she picked me up from my house at 8:30pm , drove out to my truck that i got stuck in @entity101 and she dropped me off at my truck -- it took me about 10 minutes to fix my truck , ' cause i had extra light tools with me at that time , ' ' and then we came back to @entity10			0
and i 'm pretty sure i saw her lights in my rear - view the entire time			0
' @entity41 says he went home and went to bed and did n't check to see whether @entity75 until the following morning			0

' the police told me i failed , ' @entity41 said			2
' they did n't make me take it again			0
i 'm honestly not convinced i failed , i think they might have just said that as a tactic , but i really do n't know - i 'm walking around right now without handcuffs on			0
' but @entity12 mayor @entity135 urged the public to allow investigators to do their job			0
' even though there 's an urgency to try and solve these cases , one has to be very , very patient , those in our community have to be patient , to allow that process to evolve , ' he said			0
' otherwise , we 'll jeopardise the potential of being able to use whatever evidence is being found			0
' miss @entity6 's mother , @entity148 , told the @entity149 that the family would be ' taking a breather ' and would n't be actively searching tuesday			1
