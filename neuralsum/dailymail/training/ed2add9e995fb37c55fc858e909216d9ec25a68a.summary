by @entity0 she lost her baby daughter and her right hand to a manic killing spree			1
he wielded the machete that took both			0
yet today , despite coming from opposite sides of an unspeakable shared past , @entity8 and @entity9 are friends			1
she is the treasurer and he the vice president of a group that builds simple brick houses for genocide survivors			0
they live near each other and shop at the same market			1
their story of ethnic violence , extreme guilt and , to some degree , reconciliation is the story of @entity27 today , 20 years after its @entity29 majority killed more than 1 million @entity30 and moderate @entity29			1
the @entity27 government is still accused by human rights groups of holding an iron grip on power , stifling dissent and killing political opponents			2
but even critics give president @entity38 credit for leading the country toward a peace that seemed all but impossible two decades ago			0
in this march 2014 photo , @entity9 , right , and @entity8 , left pose for a photograph outside of her house			1
in 1994 @entity46 sliced off her hand and killed her baby girl @entity49 and @entity9 , pictured , live near each other and shop at the same market ' whenever i look at my arm i remember what happened , ' said @entity55 , a mother of five with a deep scar on her left temple where @entity58 sliced her with a machete			1
as she speaks , @entity9 - the man who killed her baby - sits close enough that his left hand and her right stump sometimes touch			1
on monday , @entity27 marks the 20th anniversary of the beginning of 100 days of bloody mayhem			1
but the genocide was really in the making for decades , fueled by hate speech , discrimination , propaganda and the training of death squads			0
@entity29 had come to resent @entity30 for their greater wealth and what they saw as oppressive rule			1
@entity27 is the most densely populated country in mainland @entity78 , slightly smaller than the @entity80 state of @entity81 but with a population of more than 12 million			2
the countryside is lush green , filled with uncountable numbers of banana trees			0
the @entity88 divide may be the country 's most notorious characteristic but also its most confounding			0
the two groups are so closely related that it 's nearly impossible for an outsider to tell which the average @entity27 belongs to			1
even @entity27 have trouble knowing who is who , especially after two decades of a government push to create a single @entity27 identity			2
for @entity49 , a @entity30 , the genocide began in 1992 , when her family took refuge in a church for a week			1
@entity29 community leaders began importing machetes			2
houses were burned , cars taken			0
@entity29 leaders created lists of prominent or educated @entity30 targeted for killing			1
they also held meetings where they told those in attendance how evil the @entity30 were			2
like many of his @entity29 neighbors , @entity9 soaked in the message			1
the situation caught fire on april 6 , 1994 , when the plane carrying @entity27 's president was shot down			1
@entity29 started killing @entity30 , who ran for their lives and flooded @entity49 's village			1
three days later , local @entity29 leaders told @entity9 , then 23 , that they had a job for him			1
@entity9 severed @entity49 's right hand and sliced her face @entity9 turned himself in and confessed to his crimes in 1996 , and his prison term lasted from 1997 until 2003 they took him to a @entity30 home and ordered him to use his machete			1
a @entity131 who sang in his church choir , @entity9 had never killed before			1
but inside this house he murdered 14 people			0
the next day , april 12 , @entity9 found a @entity88 doctor in hiding and killed him , too			1
the day after , he killed two women and a child			0
' the very first family i killed , i felt bad , but then i got used to it , ' he says			0
' given how we were told that the @entity30 were evil , after the first family i just felt like i was killing our enemies			2
' in the meantime , @entity55 's family took refuge in a church , just as they had done before , crammed in with hundreds of others			0
but this time , @entity29 attackers threw a bomb inside and set the church on fire			2
those who fled the fire inside died by machetes outside			0
@entity49 lost some 26 family members , among the estimated 5,000 victims at the church			2
@entity55 , then 25 , escaped with her 9 - month - old daughter and a 9 - year - old niece into @entity27 's green countryside , moving , hiding , moving			1
she hid in a forested swamp			0
' there were so many bodies all over the place , ' she says			0
' @entity29 would wake up in the morning and go hunting for @entity30 to kill			1
' by late april rebel @entity30 fighters led by @entity38 had reached the capital and chased @entity29 out			1
@entity29 troops began to flee to neighboring countries , and the violence spread , with killings carried out by both sides			2
on april 29 , @entity9 joined @entity29 soldiers searching the countryside for @entity30			1
the attackers blew a whistle whenever they found a @entity30 hiding			2
the murders began at 10 a.m. and lasted until 3 p.m. @entity49 had been hiding in a swamp for days , keeping out only the top of her face so she could breathe			1
that was where the @entity29 found her			2
after she was attacked , @entity49 was left for dead , fell unconscious and was found three days later by other survivors @entity9 recognized @entity49 at a group for both genocide killers and survivors , who still meet weekly			1
though he first avoided her , @entity9 eventually kneeled before @entity49 to ask for forgiveness first they killed the girls			1
when that was done , they came after @entity196			0
she was sure she would die , but instinctively put up her arm up to defend herself			0
@entity9 , @entity49 's school mate , recognized the woman but could n't recall her name			1
perhaps that made it easier to rain down machete blows on @entity49 's right arm , severing it just above the wrist			1
his colleague pierced a spear through her left shoulder			0
they left her for dead			0
she was bloodied , scarred , and missing a hand , yes , but not dead			0
@entity49 fell unconscious , she says , and was found three days later by other survivors			1
it was only then that she realized she no longer had a right hand			0
in the months after the genocide , guilt gnawed away at @entity9			1
he saw his victims during nightmares			0
in 1996 , he turned himself in and confessed			1
his prison term lasted from 1997 until 2003 , when @entity38 pardoned @entity29 who admitted their guilt			1
after he was freed , he began asking family members of his victims for forgiveness			0
he joined a group of genocide killers and survivors called @entity230 , who still meet weekly			0
it was there that he saw @entity49 , the woman he thought he had killed			1
at first he avoided her			0
eventually he kneeled before her and asked for forgiveness			1
after two weeks of thought and long discussions with her husband , she said yes			2
in this march 2014 photo , @entity27 are seen reflected in the windows of an office building go about their daily business			2
although @entity27 has made significant progress since the genocide , ethnic tensions remain ' we had attended workshops and trainings and our hearts were kind of free , and i found it easy to forgive , ' she says			2
' the @entity254 says you should forgive and you will also be forgiven			0
' @entity256 is the director of peace and reconciliation programs in @entity27 for @entity259 , a @entity80 - based aid group			2
a survivor of the genocide herself , @entity256 says more killers and victims would like to reconcile but many do n't know who they attacked or were attacked by			0
it 's common here , ' she says			0
when one realizes how heavy it is the first thing they do to recuperate themselves is apologize			0
' although @entity27 has made significant progress since the genocide , ethnic tensions remain			2
@entity49 worries that some genocide planners were never caught , and that messages denying the genocide still filter into the country from @entity29 living abroad			1
she believes remembrance is important to ensure that another genocide never happens			0
for @entity9 , the anniversary periods bring back the nightmares			2
he looks like a man serving penance , who does not want to talk but feels he must			0
' i 've been asking myself why i acted like a fool , listening to such words , that this person is bad and that person is bad , ' @entity9 says			0
' the same people that encouraged the genocide are the ones saying there was no genocide			0
' he , too , worries that the embers of the genocide still smolder			0
' the problem is still there , ' @entity9 says			0
' there are @entity29 who hate me for telling the truth			0
there are those up until now who participated in the genocide who deny they took part			0
