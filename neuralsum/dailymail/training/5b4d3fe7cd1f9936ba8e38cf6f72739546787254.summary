by @entity0 published : 22:43 est , 7 october 2013 updated : 05:32 est , 8 october 2013 it may be almost seven decades since the @entity2 last flew them during @entity4 and used them in a series of devastating bombing raids on @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10			1
but @entity2 bombers will be filling the skies above some of the world 's most famous landmarks again - with the help of a new app aimed at promoting the @entity19 's latest exhibit			1
using a specially developed @entity20 , called @entity21 : @entity22 , a full scale , @entity24 of the aircraft can be placed in various locations around the globe			1
under seige : @entity22 bombers will be flying above @entity8 seven decades after the @entity4 as a new app developed by the @entity19 brings history back to life bringing history to life : the app , designed to celebrate the museum 's latest exhibit , will be available from october 16 the new app has been developed thanks to a £ 75,000 grant from @entity40 which has allowed the museum to work with @entity43 design and innovation centre to develop a new way of bringing history back to life			1
available from october 16 , visitors to the museum , and a number of other museums across @entity51 will be able to hold up their smartphones and see computer generated versions of the ' flying pencil ' aircraft flying above the scene in front of them			1
the app has been developed following the retrieval of the last surviving @entity22 from the @entity63 off the coast of @entity65 back in june - the biggest recovery of its kind in @entity69 waters			1
@entity19 director general , @entity70 : ' this heralds a new era of exhibition display and what museums can achieve			2
new exhibit : the new app has been developed thanks to a £ 75,000 grant from @entity40 ' for the first time ever the same 3d exhibit is visible in defined physical sites around the world			1
' the @entity22 aircraft recovered from @entity65 waters in june was first spotted by divers in 2008 , lying 50ft below the surface on a chalk bed , surrounded by debris			1
sonar scans carried out by the @entity19 , @entity88 and the @entity89 confirmed that the plane is the @entity92 number 1160 , which was shot down during the @entity93			2
two of its four - man crew were killed as it crashed into the sea , but the other two were captured and taken into custody as prisoners of war			0
the badly - damaged aircraft was transported more than 200 miles in june from @entity102 , @entity65 , to @entity103 in @entity104 after spending seven decades at the bottom of the @entity106			1
since its arrival on june 15 , thousands of visitors have viewed the @entity110 and additional viewing panels have been installed to allow visitors to see more of the aircraft			2
the plan to raise the plane - three years in the making - involved attaching lifting equipment to the strongest parts of the aircraft 's frame and raising it whole in a single lift on june 10			0
judging by the serial number on the aircraft it was shot down on august 26 , 1940 , at the height of the @entity93			0
it was nicknamed the @entity128 's ' flying pencil ' because of its narrow fuselage			0
around 1,500 models of the aircraft were built , but this is the last remaining			0
originally it would have been camouflaged green and dark green on top with swastikas outlined in white on both rudders			0
relic : a @entity110 17 @entity2 bomber aircraft which crashed into the sea during @entity4 is raised by a salvage crew off the coast of @entity145 , @entity65 , in june historical : the remains of the plane are currently being restored and will go on display at the @entity19 the @entity110 's bombs devastated large areas of @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 as one of the @entity128 's most important assets in the early phase of the @entity4			1
historians believe this particular plane took off on the morning of august 26 , with eight other @entity22 bombers from @entity158 in @entity2 - occupied @entity159 to bomb the @entity161 fighter base @entity162 in @entity65			1
the @entity128 lost three of its dorniers that day , including this one			0
after an attempted controlled landing , the plane somersaulted and landed on its back			0
wireless operator @entity166 and @entity168 died and their bodies were washed up in @entity171 and @entity172 respectively , where they were buried in war cemeteries			0
sunk : a sonar image released by the @entity89 showing the wreck of the @entity22 bomber lying on the @entity63 before it was raised the other two crew members , pilot @entity179 and @entity180 survived and spent the rest of the war in @entity69 prisoner - of - war camps			1
experts have been excited by the find because , apart from the effects of sea life - such as barnacles , coral and marine life , it is largely intact			0
amazingly the main undercarriage tyres remained inflated , although the propellers clearly showed the damage inflicted during the bomber 's fateful final landing			0
the @entity22 was known as the ' flying pencil ' , because of its unusually narrow fuselage			2
it was one of the main bombers used by the @entity128 during the @entity4 , including at the @entity93 in 1940			0
the plane was developed to be a commercial aircraft , but was turned down by @entity203 and redesigned into a bomber			2
in action : a @entity110 bomber similar to the one which crashed into the sea during the @entity93 although the @entity22 was no longer made after 1940 , it was used by @entity211 forces throughout the war			2
more than 400 of them were flown in the @entity93 , with 171 shot down by the @entity161 or otherwise lost			0
the planes were 52ft long with a wingspan of 59ft , and could carry 2,000lb of explosives while manned by a crew of four			0
none of the aircraft were believed to have survived for long after the end of the conflict , until the discovery of the plane off the coast of @entity65 .			1

a new app developed for the @entity19 will see @entity2 bombers take to the air again
the new app uses 3d *technology* to *superimpose* @entity22 aircraft onto modern day *landscapes*
the app has been developed after the museum raised the last surviving @entity22 from the @entity65 seabed
