president @entity0 has stepped up his battle to close @entity2 , summoning top officials to the @entity4 to push for the notorious detention centre to close			1
but the president , who made a pledge to close the prison on the day he took office in 2008 , is likely to face tough opposition from @entity11 which has ruled out transferring any prisoners to the @entity13 this means @entity0 may have to send inmates abroad if he wishes to close the jail , but the administration does not want to release all prisoners - including five suspected 9/11 plotters			1
since that meeting , a dozen prisoners have been transferred overseas , with another five expected to leave the @entity13 naval base in @entity36 before the end of the year			0
the prison population is at its lowest point since shortly after it opened in 2002 , with just 136 left , of which half are cleared to leave the detention centre			1
at its peak , @entity2 held 700 suspects			2
but actually closing @entity2 would either require approval from @entity11 , which has prohibited transferring any prisoners to the @entity13 , or the transfer of potentially dangerous individuals to other countries - which @entity0 's opponents are warning him against but administration officials say has n't been ruled out			1
' we 're working on it , ' @entity0 said at a bookstore over the @entity54 weekend when a shopper expressed hope @entity2 will close			2
the president wants to close the detention centre because he believes it is unnecessary , expensive at more than $ 440million a year , and to be a propaganda tool for the country 's enemies			1
actually closing @entity2 would either require approval from @entity11 or the transfer of potentially dangerous individuals to other countries the prisoner population is at its lowest point since shortly after it opened in 2002 , with just 136 left , of which half are cleared to leave the detention centre but members of @entity11 argue that it should remain open to hold and question terrorism suspects , and that dangerous inmates should not be moved to @entity13			1
most prisoners cleared for transfers are from @entity73 , where a violent @entity75 - linked group makes it too unstable to send them home			0
but the day after @entity0 's meeting , @entity77 and @entity78 accepted the first @entity73 to leave since 2010 , proving that resettlement elsewhere is an option			0
administration officials say more prisoners who previously were classified as too dangerous to be let out are expected to be cleared for transfer in an ongoing review			0
but the administration does n't want to release some detainees , including the prisoners facing trial by military commission for war crimes â€” a group that includes five men charged with planning and aiding the 9/11 attacks			2
administration officials said the president 's message in the november 19 @entity4 meeting was primarily directed at @entity100 , who was reluctant to sign off on guarantees that those transferred would not pose a security threat			0
five days after that meeting , @entity100 resigned under pressure , with administration officials saying @entity2 was one of the issues behind his departure			0
his replacement , @entity112 , would not have been chose for the job if he did not understand closure of the prison was a priority , an anonymous official told the @entity117 .			0

president @entity0 steps up his drive to shut down @entity2
a total of 136 prisoners are left at the detention centre , down from 700
but @entity11 has ruled out transferring @entity2 prisoners to @entity13 jails
this means the president may have to deport inmates to other countries
but he does not want to release some detainees - including 9/11 suspects
