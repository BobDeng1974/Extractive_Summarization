at @entity1 on sunday , @entity0 gave a fascinating insight into his motivation to lead @entity4 to the top			1
he had just been asked about his quip - ‘ the run was @entity12 and the finish was @entity14 ’ - after @entity7 scuffed a chance to make it 4 - 0 at @entity10			2
‘ a few of you thought i was @entity17 when i got the job and i have n’t forgotten that either , ’ he remarked			2
his mood changed instantly , though , when he was asked about the flexibility and tactical awareness of this @entity4 team			2
his enthusiasm for the development of young players in his side is infectious			1
that is his passion , committing himself to improving the players he has on the training ground each day at @entity4			1
if only there were more like this in the game			0
these are the skills @entity0 acquired when he was a young coach , first at @entity46 and then at @entity47			1
although he accepts that there is pressure to compete for a place in the top four again , particularly after last season ’s title challenge , he also wants to improve and nurture his players			0
there was genuine care in his voice , almost pastoral , when he was asked about @entity7 ’s performance and his preferred position on the field on sunday			2
this is what @entity0 said : ‘ i think he 's flexible			2
we 've tried to develop him not only to be a wide player but to have the freedom and the awareness to play on the inside			0
‘ it was perfect for him today : he can turn , press , work , and in a 4 - 3 - 3 he can work on the side and penetrate			0
it 's important he has the intelligence to play these different positions			0
’ this has echoes of the @entity79 school of thought , with its origins in the philosophy of the great coach @entity84			0
everybody has to be comfortable on the ball , to be flexible on the field and learn to play in different positions			0
@entity89 , one of the game ’s most distinguished and decorated players , played up front , in the centre of midfield and as a sweeper during his career			0
he looked at home in all three			0
@entity98 , whose instructive autobiography @entity100 and @entity101 is a motivational tool for young players , played out on the wing for @entity105 before he became one of the world ’s most accomplished no 10s			1
for @entity111 football and its players to flourish again , the @entity109 will need more coaches with @entity0 ’ feeling for the game			1
@entity7 work : @entity0 has developed @entity4 's wonderkid @entity7 scoring touch : @entity7 steers the ball in for @entity4 's first goal at @entity1 on sunday @entity4 ’s manager has no obligation to @entity122 , but he started with four internationals - captain @entity123 , @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity7 , at @entity1			1
not a huge number , but more than his rivals			0
@entity129 , who played at @entity131 on sunday , fielded none in their starting @entity133 with the exception of @entity123 , who retired from international football after the @entity137 , the other three are in the @entity122 team for wednesday evening ’s friendly with @entity139			2
to many , the tactical expressions are a turn - off in a game that can be over-complicated at times by managers theorising about systems and formations			0
thumbs up : @entity0 is always trying to make his @entity4 players better , no matter what their age the @entity149 : @entity125 ( left ) has really developed under the guidance of his @entity4 boss but @entity0 tests his players , pushing their minds that little bit more and asking them to stretch the limits			1
@entity7 is the latest example			2
you sure you 're not @entity17 ? ! @entity0 strikes a pose reminiscent of the @entity17 picture further up ‘ he needs to be better on his left foot , ’ was @entity0 ’ considered analysis after he missed the chance to score a second goal against @entity10			1
‘ his tactical awareness is improving and for a kid of 19 ... he 's going to be great			0
@entity166 , @entity126 and @entity125 are going to do well for @entity167 in the years to come			2
they 've shown they can play in different positions			0
’ @entity7 himself admitted , after the impressive win over @entity10 , that he has been asked to play and learn a number of positions across @entity4 ’s forward line			1
how many managers , under almost intolerable pressure to win every match and not make mistakes , are prepared to risk that ? not many			0
it was n’t that long ago , when @entity0 was mocked for his part in being : @entity4 , that @entity7 was getting it in the neck from the @entity4 manager			1
at the time , @entity0 told the @entity4 forward that he would be on the first plane back to @entity122 from their @entity188 tour in 2012 after he made a disrespectful comment to his manager			1
others in this @entity4 team are maturing , too			1
when @entity125 spoke on monday at @entity122 ’s training base , he was passionate about the future of the national team			1
he spoke about the @entity149 , the doctrines and principles the @entity4 manager has impressed upon this group of players			1
@entity125 is captaincy material for club and country , a fine example of a young player increasing in influence on and off the field			1
in time , it will all be there for him			0
@entity125 ’s personality has been teased out of him , partially down to his improved performances on the pitch alongside his captain			2
back in the training ground office at @entity214 , @entity0 has played his part in that			0
video how to manage @entity217 , with @entity0			0

@entity0 was once compared to @entity17
@entity0 ' passion is developing young players at @entity4
he also wants players to be able to play anywhere
the @entity109 needs more bosses with @entity0 ' vision
the likes of @entity7 and @entity125 are maturing
that is good news for @entity4 and @entity122
