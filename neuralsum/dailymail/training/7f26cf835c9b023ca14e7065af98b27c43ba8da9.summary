by @entity0 a @entity2 woman has told how she got a piece of platinum jewelry inserted in her eye to set herself apart from the crowd			1
@entity7 visited dr @entity8 at @entity9 to get a ' cute ' heart - shaped sequin , measuring 3.5mm , placed on the white of her of right eye ball			1
she told @entity14 before the $ 3,000 , one minute - long procedure : ' it 's going to be a conversation maker			1
i will be able to tell people			2
it will be sort of my unique factor			2
' a permanent twinkle ! @entity7 got a piece of platinum jewelry inserted in her eye according to @entity27 and @entity29 - trained dr @entity8 the eye jewelry procedure has been done hundreds of times in @entity31 and in @entity32 , but never before in @entity2			1
ms @entity7 was one of his first clients			0
to start the process he injected anesthetic into her eye to numb the area			2
then he made a small incision to make room for the piece of jewelry			0
' i 'm going to take scissors and make a little incision and try to divide a pocket in between the sclera - the white part of your eye - and conjunctiva clear part of your eye , ' he explained			2
using forceps he positioned the tiny flat stud into position on ms @entity7 's eye membrane			1
she wanted it set pointing diagonally			0
minutes later she was handed a mirror to admire her new accessory and given the go - ahead to go home			0
' it will be sort of my unique factor ' : the blonde appeared happy with her new eye jewel though it may sound scary , dr @entity8 insists the procedure , which was invented by a @entity71 eye surgeon and introduced in 2004 , is actually pretty safe			1
' it 's a very thin piece of platinum that 's designed for insertion on the top of the eye , it 's not in the eye so there 's no risk of blindness or anything at all , ' he says			1
' she could have a little bit of local bleeding			0
that could go away in a couple days or couple weeks			0
she could have an infection but we 'll prevent that with antibiotics			0
' but the jewelry has not been @entity91 approved and the @entity92 is warning consumers about the dangers			1
steady - handed : first dr @entity8 at @entity9 injected anesthetic into her eye to numb the area , then he made a small incision to make room for the piece of jewelry nearly over : because the piece of jewelry is so tiny - 0.13 of an inch - it ca n't be inserted with an instrument - instead , it is placed in a drop of water on the eye membrane and floated into position in a statement to @entity113 , the medical body said there is not ' sufficient evidence to support the safety or therapeutic value of this procedure			1
' it urges consumers to ' avoid placing in the eye any foreign body or material that is not approved by the @entity91			1
' @entity124 , @entity125 , a comprehensive ophthalmologist from @entity126 , @entity127 previously warned : ' my concern would be that it might cause foreign body granuloma or scar tissue			0
' the implant could also allow bacteria to get beneath the conjunctiva causing a serious vision - threatening infection or possibly erode the sclera , the white part of the eye			2
' advocate : dr @entity8 insists the procedure , which was invented by a @entity71 eye surgeon and introduced in 2004 , is safe - but other professionals are warning against it a few days after her procedure , ms @entity7 said she had no issues or pain and loved her new designer accessory			1
' 50 percent of my friends are like : " what is it ? why do you need it oh my god are you crazy ? " ' she exclaimed			0
' but 50per cent of my friends are like : " @entity158 , it 's super cool			0
" ' and if she gets bored of her heart - shaped implant it can be swapped it for something different			0
' you can switch from a star for @entity166 , for example , ' dr @entity8 states on his website , adding that each swap incurs a $ 1,000 fee .			0
