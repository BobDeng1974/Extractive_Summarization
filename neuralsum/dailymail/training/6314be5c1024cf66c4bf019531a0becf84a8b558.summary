the response from @entity2 ’s representatives this week when consulted by @entity3 could not have been more emphatic			2
asked if it was a fair assumption that @entity2 would not be going anywhere soon the message was : ‘ correct , and you can leave out the word “ soon ” ’			0
@entity2 joined @entity9 last summer to win trophies			1
in just over 12 months he has won the @entity11 , the @entity12 , the @entity13 and the @entity14			2
in three of those four games he scored a crucial goal and in the other he fulfilled a dream by winning a major honour in his home city , @entity20			0
for @entity2 the move has been a massive success and he is not about get off the trophy train after only one and a half seasons			0
@entity2 scores @entity9 's second goal in the final of the @entity14 in @entity27 the @entity29 star kisses the @entity31 trophy , his fourth since joining @entity9 the summer before last he had the chance to join @entity34 the summer before last			1
their offer came very late but was greater than @entity9 ’s and @entity2 could still have pulled the plug on the @entity39 switch and move to @entity40 , but he chose to go ahead with the transfer to the @entity43 capital and there is no desire to change course now			1
neither is there any desire to move @entity2 on from @entity9 president @entity49			1
when @entity2 scored @entity9 ’s second goal against @entity51 last weekend to ensure his team won the @entity14 club president @entity49 could be seen calling out ‘ @entity2 ! ’ as he celebrated high in the @entity27			1
when @entity49 spent £ 86m ( 100m euros ) on @entity2 last summer he was criticized for replacing the popular @entity55 and that criticism intensified when @entity2 struggled with injury and @entity59 ’s front page declared he was suffering from a slipped disc that would need surgery			1
his gamble has been completely justified however and he is not about to let @entity34 take the player in january having beaten them to the punch less than two seasons ago			0
the @entity29 winger has developed a knack of scoring in @entity9 's most important games @entity2 poses with fellow former @entity71 star @entity70 after winning the @entity12 last season @entity73 and assistant coach @entity74 would also be in complete opposition to the move			1
when i asked @entity74 about the variety of @entity9 ’s attacking options he told me last month : ‘ it ’s a nice position to be in			0
with @entity2 the dynamic of the team is different			0
it looks to penetrate in behind more			0
’ @entity2 is a major reason why @entity9 are now so unstoppable			2
they have the players to pass their way through teams but @entity2 gives them a more direct route to goal			0
with the player , the manager and the president all against any move it is difficult to see how @entity34 could prise him away from the @entity96			2
their greatest hope could be that poll that revealed 54 per cent of supporters in favour of a sale at £ 120m			2
manager @entity73 ( left ) and president @entity49 ( centre ) are both keen to hold on to @entity2 some @entity9 fans prefer the subtlety of @entity43 midfielder @entity107 to @entity2 's pace and power despite interest from @entity34 there is no appetite from the player , or the club , for a move over 30,000 fans responded to @entity118 ’s survey and you might have expected the club ’s supporters to have been more vehement in their opposition considering all that @entity2 has done for the team in such a short time			1
a large portion of them are one - eyed when it comes to style of play and prefer @entity43 international @entity107 ’s more subtle flicks and tricks to @entity2 ’s power and pace			0
the idea of the club making a profit on @entity2 and then going out to buy @entity137 appeals to some			0
there is no apparent evidence of the @entity141 having learned @entity43 and while @entity142 also failed to speak the lingo in his four years at the club he got by with a fondness for the limelight that @entity2 shows no signs of developing			0
like @entity142 , @entity2 has failed to learn @entity43 , and he brings less showmanship than the @entity149 real are keen to keep the ' @entity151 ' frontline of @entity2 , @entity152 and @entity153 together that linguistic reticence has contributed to the feeling of some that he would be replaceable			1
but for every fan that argues a big offer should be accepted there is another who will recall the four trophies that @entity9 have won since he arrived – only three were won in the three years previous – and make the case for him being kept right where he is at any price			1
@entity2 is happy living in the ‘ @entity170 ’ neighbourhood of @entity9 close to @entity153 and @entity152 the players he has formed the @entity151 strikeforce alongside			2
the @entity2 , @entity152 , @entity153 trio looks set to keep @entity9 at the top of world club football for the foreseeable future			1
@entity34 have many obstacles to cross if they are to persuade the world and @entity177 club champions to break it up .			0

@entity2 joined @entity9 for £ 86m in 2013
@entity2 has since won four trophies , *including* the @entity12
player has no intention of leaving the club and returning to @entity149
manager @entity73 and president @entity49 keen to keep him
a recent fan poll indicated 54 per cent of @entity9 fans want to sell @entity2
