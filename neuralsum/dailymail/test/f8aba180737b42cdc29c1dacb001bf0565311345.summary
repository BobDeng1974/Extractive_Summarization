all eyes were again on @entity1 as @entity2 on thursday night began their push for victory here but instead the limelight was seized by @entity7 with his second stunning catch of the first test			1
a day that featured a fourth @entity12 century in only his ninth match for @entity15 ended with the leader of @entity2 ’s attack still waiting for the wicket that will bring him level with sir @entity21 ’s test record			1
so well did @entity23 and @entity2 bat that @entity24 was able to set @entity25 a target of 438 in just over four sessions that would even surpass their own world record successful test chase			1
yet so solidly did @entity25 begin their attempt to emerge unscathed from this first of three @entity9 that it became pertinent to remember that record was set in none other than @entity34 and featured a century by a certain @entity35			0
it remains highly unlikely that @entity25 will today surpass the 418 for seven they made to defeat @entity37 at the old @entity38 12 years ago			0
@entity24 , though , will be grateful for the athleticism of @entity40 and the off - spin of @entity42 for the wicket that means @entity2 remain firm favourites to secure today what would be a highly valuable victory for them			1
when @entity25 grafted their way to 90 for one on this fourth day it was possible to believe that they would at least be able to escape with a draw from this match and head to @entity53 next week still all square			0
yet when @entity7 dived to his right at wide slip and grasped the chance offered by @entity59 ’s flailing bat in @entity42 ’s second over a second @entity61 wicket had fallen and @entity2 ended the day with a spring in their step			1
they still have much to do and all results remain possible but @entity2 will be much the happier with @entity25 finishing on 98 for two , still a massive 340 short of recreating @entity12 history			2
for @entity1 , however , there was just more frustration as he could not strike a blow in the seven overs he has so far bowled in the second innings			0
@entity21 remains in the wings , with a nice bottle of red at the ready , to congratulate @entity1 if and when the big moment comes today			0
@entity2 timed both the pace of their batting and their declaration to perfection , scoring quickly enough to set @entity25 that world record breaking target and giving themselves 130 overs to bowl them out			2
and at the centre of their batting effort was @entity15 who has made a start to his @entity9 career that can genuinely be described as great			2
@entity59 nicks @entity42 's delivery as @entity7 gets ready to pounce @entity59 can only watch on as @entity40 makes a stunning dive to seize the loose ball @entity7 shows tremendous reflexes to cling on to dismiss the @entity25 batsman @entity15 plays a shot during day four of @entity2 's first test against @entity25 on thursday @entity23 plays a sweeping shot during his impressive innings at the sir @entity97 @entity23 celebrates bringing up his century following his superb batting display in @entity34 @entity42 formed a solid partnership with @entity23 and made big inroads against the home side @entity42 salutes the stands after he brought up his half century earlier in the day @entity105 also impressed for @entity107 ' side with an unbeaten 59 off 56 balls it is extraordinary , really , that @entity23 should have been perceived to be under any sort of pressure going into the second innings of this first test			1
yes , he had a poor @entity115 after being thrown into the @entity2 team with little preparation ahead of their opening match against @entity37			2
and , yes , @entity15 looked tentative in the first innings here at the sir @entity97 , pushing at a ball with hard hands he could have left alone			0
yet memories are short these days and it should be remembered that @entity23 had an extraordinary summer last year having been asked to bat in a position at @entity128 he was unaccustomed to by coach @entity107			2
this was the @entity23 of last season , the white shirt seemingly a much better fit than the blue of limited - overs cricket , and he is quite simply a run machine in the ultimate form of the game			0
@entity42 was furious with himself when he again got an inside edge to be bowled when a century was there for the taking but his partnership of 114 with @entity23 came at a crucial time for @entity2 with @entity25 still in the hunt			1
it says everything about @entity23 ’s 122 that the only time he looked in trouble was when @entity105 hit @entity150 straight back at him and struck his batting partner a nasty blow on the elbow			2
other than that it was pretty much plain sailing for @entity2 , with @entity105 also returning to form with an unbeaten 59 off 56 balls			1
@entity157 ( centre ) celebrates with his @entity2 team - mates after taking the wicket of @entity161 @entity42 ( right ) gets the plaudits from his team - mates after he took the wicket of @entity59 late on day four the openers , of course , are much more of an issue but a win here on friday would buy @entity24 a bit of time for both him and @entity172 to get things right in @entity53 next week and @entity174 in the final test			1
with @entity1 in the form that saw him take only two of the four wickets he needed at the start of this test to surpass @entity21 ’s tally of 383 in the first innings it was left to @entity157 to strike the first blow for @entity2			1
an absolute brute of a delivery saw @entity187 fending to short leg and @entity157 quickly pointing to the dressing room to salute the role that bowling coach @entity191 , who knows @entity25 inside out having been their coach until earlier this year , played in the dismissal			1
@entity1 unsuccessfully appeals for the wicket of @entity59 earlier in the contest he is one of the best slip fielders @entity2 have found in years but @entity7 will be annoyed he could not pouch another chance offered by @entity197 before the close			0
@entity197 lived to fight another day on 59 and he too was in @entity25 ’ side that famous day in 2003 when history was made			0
if he is part of history again then it will have been an extraordinary last day			0
any hopes of a @entity25 collapse quickly faded and all was quiet until @entity7 ’s intervention to replicate his similar diving effort in the first innings			0
the @entity25 side await a decision from the third empire on the fourth day of action in the @entity212 he is clearly one of the best slip fielders @entity2 have found in years but @entity7 will be annoyed that he could not get a hand to another sharp chance offered by @entity197 off @entity42 before the close			1
@entity197 lives to fight another day on 59 and it should be pointed out that he too was in @entity25 side that famous day in 2003 when history was made on this island			0
if he is part of history again then it really will have been an extraordinary last day .			0

@entity15 is now averaging in excess of *60* for @entity2
@entity15 's knock of 122 was impressive at @entity128
@entity42 shone before he was eventually dismissed for 59
@entity105 also did well with the bat , an unbeaten 59 off 56 balls
@entity157 struck early , clean bowling out @entity187
@entity2 finished the day eight wickets from victory in first test
