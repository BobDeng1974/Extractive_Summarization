by @entity0 last updated at 1:02 am on 21st december 2011 a gang of bullying car clampers extorted up to £ 350,000 from motorists while laughing off their desperate protests			1
in a judgment that will be cheered by thousands of victims of clamping cowboys , @entity8 , 47 , @entity9 , 43 , and @entity10 , 30 , were jailed for a total of ten years			1
two of the men had also been claiming tens of thousands in illegal benefit payments			0
@entity8 ( left ) @entity9 ( centre ) and @entity10 ( right ) netted up to £ 350,000 by intimidating members of the public into paying clamping fees the gang would pounce on unsuspecting drivers – often women with young children – and charge them as much as £ 600 to get their cars back			1
police estimate the trio could have pocketed £ 350,000 from their three - year clamping scam before they were eventually arrested on blackmail and fraud charges			0
the court was told that they used a ‘ spotter ’ who would lurk near private land they managed on behalf of shops and businesses , waiting to catch motorists parking			0
as soon as they left their car , it would be clamped and a tow truck would be sent within minutes to haul it away			1
notices stated that the price of releasing a clamp was £ 100 , but if the vehicle was towed away this increased to £ 350 , rising again to £ 500 once ‘ storage fees ’ were applied			2
when the driver returned , the clampers would then aggressively confront them , often giving them little chance to pay the minimum release fee			0
sometimes the gang lifted cars on to tow trucks with drivers still at the wheel			0
police were inundated with complaints that the clampers were demanding up to £ 600 to get their cars back			0
@entity61 heard the trio operated as @entity63 from 2005 to 2008 at a base in @entity65 in @entity66			0
@entity67 , prosecuting , told the court : ‘ the sums involved were eye - watering			2
’ police say @entity8 ( left ) was the ringleader of the gang			1
along with @entity9 ( centre ) and riddle ( right ) he ran the ' bullying ' enterprise for three years @entity8 and @entity9 were also found to have illegally claimed £ 54,000 in council tax benefit , housing benefit and income support			1
they were also not paying income tax or national insurance			0
jailing the three men , judge @entity82 said : ‘ in the course of this business you extorted considerable sums of money from members of the public by arrogant , bullying and aggressive behaviour			2
the gang would often clamp cars as soon as drivers had parked them ‘ you were licensed to clamp cars and had a form of uniform and badges to show your authenticity			0
‘ in my judgment this aggravates the position because it gave the impression the sums you were demanding and the behaviour you were exhibiting was authentic			2
you caused great distress and anxiety to the car owners			2
’ one of their victims , @entity112 , an @entity114 major from @entity115 , said she had been visiting a relative in @entity117 when her car was clamped and towed			1
she said : ‘ i explained i was just back from @entity119 for a short time and all my military kit was in that car and how urgently i needed it			2
he laughed and said , “ i get told these stories all the time ”			0
’ a female victim told how she was inside her car when they lifted it up to tow it off			1
another , @entity130 , who successfully got the clamping gang to release her car after calling the police , was warned : ‘ i will get you next time			0
’ @entity8 , from @entity65 , was jailed for five - and - a - half years after pleading guilty to blackmail and making unwarranted demands for money with menaces			1
he also admitted benefit fraud totalling £ 42,518 and engaging in an aggressive commercial practice			0
@entity9 , also from @entity65 , admitted blackmail , making unwarranted demands with menaces and benefit fraud totalling £ 12,000 , and was jailed for three years			1
@entity10 , from @entity143 , @entity66 , was handed an 18 - month term for his part in the clamping scam after pleading guilty to conspiracy to blackmail and making unwarranted demands for money			1
after sentencing , police said the operation to snare @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 had taken four years			1
sergeant @entity152 , from @entity153 and @entity154 , said : ‘ they were able to charge what they wanted as there was no defined law to control their activities			0

@entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 intimidated their victims , often women with young children , into handing over large sums of cash
one victim was forced to sit on her car to stop it being towed
