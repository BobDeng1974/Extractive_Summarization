the world of football punditry is certainly a wacky one at the moment			2
in the olden days , the expert would more often than not pick their team , then stick with it			2
nowadays though , that badge they kiss might as well be on velcro as they suddenly turn up worrying about quite how flat a back four is for all manner of channels			2
with the ex-pros over at @entity16 providing a notable exception , it would seem the story is very much , have big , intricately knotted scarf - will travel			0
the @entity20 and @entity21 have already clearly decided the entente is clearly cordiale in this matter as the latter 's commentary teams proved more than compatible with @entity20 's @entity27 output			0
while on the very same weekend , @entity29 stalwart @entity28 turned up at @entity21 so we could hear his thoughts on one of his former clubs , @entity33			1
although to be fair , in @entity28 's case , he is already hearing the retirement carriage clock ticking			0
so pick it up by the little brass handle , @entity28 , and get busy ! @entity21 is also where we last saw @entity38 doing his new thing			1
which is very much in his case , since retiring from playing , talking			0
@entity38 was employed to fill one of the zippy old sports car seats on @entity21 's @entity45 show			1
@entity46 being perhaps the prime example of a man who seems to have his name on a mug in both channel 's kitchens			0
@entity29 's punditry team brave the cold as they stand close to the pitch at the @entity56 @entity57 was making his debut as @entity29 's host having replaced @entity60 and those of you who saw it will know that he really seemed to enjoy the experience alongside his elaborately - haired former @entity66 youth team - mate			1
because he looked like he 'd got to reminisce about a form of transport @entity69 used to apparently favour			0
at least , that 's what i assume was happening when @entity38 laughed gently to himself in the studio , then muttered under his breath ' moped '			1
yes , i 've watched it back			0
he is definitely talking about @entity69 's old two stroke engine motorbike			0
come tuesday evening , @entity38 was back			1
and it was now his turn to turn the other channel			0
@entity38 was now over on @entity29 as part of their revamped football coverage			1
@entity60 is now officially providing his face for radio			1
with one of the airwaves ' finest , @entity57 taking his place in the process			2
and for this return to the channel 's coverage of the @entity95 , one of @entity60 ' old sparring partners - well , you did get the feeling he 'd loved to have given him a little dig - @entity101 was also now back to share his thoughts with us			1
although i would have been very surprised if , as a result , @entity38 then decided he 'd have a giggle at the expense of this former @entity109 's preferred mode of transport			2
@entity38 and former @entity66 team - mate @entity111 on ' @entity45 ' @entity38 appeared to call @entity46 a ' k * * * head ' live on @entity21 's ' @entity45 ' @entity101 during @entity29 's coverage of @entity115 's @entity95 tie with @entity116 instead , what we saw was a very steady piece of sport telly			1
no longer pitchside , but still stood @entity121 amongst the crowd dressed like an am - dram production of ' on @entity127 ' ( @entity126 fans will understand ) , this new line - up absolutely hit the stands running			0
indeed , so seamless was it , the only mild controversy was the fact that @entity101 described it all as ' if anything , pretty boring '			1
that can be how these games are sometimes			0
but you could certainly argue that at least what @entity57 did as a result was not choose to try and wring blood out of a stone			2
taking his pundits through the procedure with no fuss or histrionics , this was very much a steady start for the new @entity29 line up			2
to the point where @entity147 even played ball in the post-match interview			0
in fact , the only real drama we saw was @entity155 moving the referee 's disappearing foam at a free - kick			0
oh , perhaps that 's who @entity38 was talking about ? @entity38 soaks up the atmosphere at the @entity56 before the game on tuesday night @entity163 rises highest to head home the opener , giving @entity115 a precious away goal the impressive @entity167 equalised shortly after the break , heading home @entity170 's cross			1

@entity57 made his debut on @entity29 as @entity60 ' replacement
he was *joined* by @entity101 , @entity38 and @entity176
@entity57 performed seamlessly throughout , even if the game was boring
