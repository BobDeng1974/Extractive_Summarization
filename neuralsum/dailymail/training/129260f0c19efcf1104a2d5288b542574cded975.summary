by @entity0 the secret to happiness is helping others - and setting yourself concrete goals to do so , say researchers			1
they claims that achieving goals give us a far greater sense of satisfaction that abstract concepts of helping others			2
the team even admit that chasing happiness without clearly defined goals could make us unhappy , resulting in ' helper burnout '			2
researchers say the key to being happy is you set goals you can achieve , rather than rely on abstract concepts one experiment the team carried out involved bone marrow transplants focused on the whether giving those who need bone marrow transplants ' greater hope ' – the abstract goal – or giving those who need bone marrow transplants a ' better chance of finding a donor ' – the concrete goal – made a giver more happy			1
the answer was that helping someone find a donor resulted in more happiness for the giver			0
this , the researchers wrote , was driven by givers ' perceptions that their actual acts better met their expectations of accomplishing their goal of helping another person			0
givers are likely to experience greater happiness if they frame acts of benevolence in concrete rather than abstract terms , according to the new study			0
' although the desire for personal happiness may be clear , the path to achieving it is indefinite , ' said @entity59 at @entity60 , who led the research			0
' one reason for this hazy route to happiness is that although people often think they know what leads to happiness , their predictions about what will make them happy are often inaccurate			1
' the team say one path to happiness is through concrete , specific goals of benevolence – like making someone smile or increasing recycling – instead of following similar but more abstract goals – like making someone happy or saving the environment			1
the reason is that when you pursue concretely framed goals , your expectations of success are more likely to be met in reality			2
on the other hand , broad and abstract goals may bring about happiness ' dark side – unrealistic expectations			1
' discrepancies between aspirations and reality can be critical factors that , in extreme cases , may even lead the act of helping to eventually becoming a source of unhappiness , ' said @entity100 , an assistant professor of marketing at the @entity102 , who also worked on the research			0
for example , when people pursue abstract prosocial goals and expect their relentless giving to result in tremendous and rapid change for the better and it fails to materialize they can suffer from ' helper burnout , ' which can negatively impact happiness			1
@entity114 , founder of @entity115 shoes the firm promises that if a customer buys a pair of shoes , they will deliver another pair to a child in need			1
the results also have implications for the world of business , the team say			0
for instance , marketing or products that claim to help consumers achieve abstractly framed goals – like making someone else happy – might not be the best business decision			1
instead , it might be wiser to reframe these promised goals in more specific , concrete terms - such as @entity115 , which promises that if a customer buys a pair of shoes , they will deliver another pair to a child in need			1
' concrete initiatives such as this may be a more realistic way to accurately set consumers ' expectations from the outset and leave them happier in the end , ' @entity59 said			0
ultimately , people seek to be happy , and one clear path toward happiness is through prosocial behaviors			2
@entity59 explained , ' a prosocial act can not only boost the happiness of the recipient , but it can boost the happiness of the giver as well			0
' one experiment the team carried out involved bone marrow transplants focused on the whether giving those who need bone marrow transplants ' greater hope ' – the abstract goal – or giving those who need bone marrow transplants a ' better chance of finding a donor ' – the concrete goal – made a giver more happy			2
the answer was that helping someone find a donor resulted in more happiness for the giver			0
this , the researchers wrote , was driven by givers ' perceptions that their actual acts better met their expectations of accomplishing their goal of helping another person .			0

researchers say having abstract goals can actually make people less happy
