by @entity0 published : 17:13 est , 15 august 2013 updated : 17:57 est , 15 august 2013 the summer of 2013 will be remembered for bringing plenty of welcome sunshine			1
but @entity4 beach - goers may also have less pleasant memories - as the warm weather has also brought a record season for dive - bombing seagulls			1
the reason , according to experts , is that the breeding season has been extended into the summer holidays ... and chicks are still around to be protected - and fed. invasion of the birdy snatchers : seagulls attack a young man , who was holding an ice cream , and his friend on a beach in @entity19 , @entity20			1
the warm weather has brought a record season for the dive - bombing birds @entity23 who owns the @entity25 cafe in the centre of the seaside town of @entity28 , @entity22 is fighting back			1
@entity30 waterpistols for customers and staff scare off the seagulls which plaque his restaurant this has combined with an increase in the number of human targets visiting the coast - leading to countless clashes			1
the @entity42 received over three times as many calls about seagulls last month in the @entity46 compared with july 2012 , up from 51 to 173			1
this year ’s breeding season started out slowly because of the cold weather in march and april but heated up in june and july , culminating in a late feeding frenzy			1
an influx of visitors to beaches and resorts , meanwhile , is giving the brazen birds more opportunities to steal from humans			2
the reason for the increase in dive - bombing gulls , according to experts , is that the breeding season has been extended into the summer holidays - and chicks are still around to be protected and fed in @entity20 , tourists face a daily barrage from dive - bombing gulls determined to grab ice creams , pasties and takeaways			1
in @entity19 , the birds even make their nests directly above restaurants and snack bars and target tourists with ever more aggressive tactics , swooping down at 40mph to wrench away food from anyone foolhardy enough to eat in public			2
seagull expert @entity78 said the spike in food - snatching incidents is simply down to the bumper breeding season and the added opportunity to steal from tourists			1
mr @entity78 said : ‘ in 2013 we had an exceptionally cold start to the breeding season with a lot of birds postponing their breeding until july and august			1
‘ we still have young birds waiting to fledge right now			2
it ’s become a protracted breeding season			1
‘ in past summers , we ’ve seen pretty awful weather , but this year some of the weather has been brilliantly sunny and hot			2
‘ that means a lots of people are on the beach with their food and their ice creams which the gulls are very adept at snatching , in @entity19 in particular			2
‘ they really are very clever			2
one will swoop down so somebody moves their food away from the incoming bird only to find it snatched by a second bird working in cahoots			0
’ @entity113 , 29 , manager of the @entity114 , in the resort , said yesterday : ‘ this is by far the worst i have seen the seagulls			1
‘ we get people coming back to us on a daily basis saying how they ’ve had their pasties taken			0
‘ there are far more of them this year and they are a lot more aggressive			0
they seem to work in groups and target young children			0
’ @entity125 , 52 , visiting from @entity126 , added : ‘ the seagulls are awful			1
they ’re extremely aggressive and are really threatening			0
‘ yesterday i was sitting eating on the beach when one seagull dived in , bit my hand and took my chicken			0
it knocked it out of my hand and onto the sand then took the piece			0
‘ attacks happen all the time			0
i saw a little girl have an ice cream taken from her hand			0
she burst into tears and looked terrified			0
’ @entity141 , 20 , sales assistant at @entity143 ice cream parlour , added : ‘ seagulls have always been a problem here but they ’re becoming more tactical and are attacking more often			1
‘ the problem has become so bad that we now warn every customer about them and have signs up in our shop			0
’ another possible explanation behind the gulls ' extra aggression is that they are becoming ‘ drunk ’ feasting on flying ants , of which there are record numbers due to the hot weather			0
the ants turn to acid in their stomachs and act like alcohol , apparently lowering the birds ’ inhibitions and making them ever more bold			0
on the prowl : in @entity19 , @entity20 ( above ) , the birds even make their nests directly above restaurants and snack bars and target tourists with ever more aggressive tactics , swooping down at 40mph to wrench away food from anyone foolhardy enough to eat in public @entity178 insists the gulls in @entity19 are legally protected members of a wild species and thus can not simply be culled			1
over the years it has tried various schemes to curb the menace - including ‘ bird dispersal units ’ who go around playing high - pitched tapes of gulls squawking in distress to scare them off			0
elsewhere in @entity4 , the urban gull population is growing by 20 per cent a year			0
@entity192 is using artificial eggs to trick seagulls into thinking they are rearing young to stem a spate of dive - bomb attacks in the city centre			2
@entity42 spokesman @entity200 said most run - ins between humans and seagulls ( @entity19 , above ) were simply the result of birds innocently trying to protect their chicks authorities in @entity207 have introduced a fine for feeding seagulls and wildlife experts in @entity211 have even tried feeding them contraceptives			1
the @entity42 has also had to warn against vigilante attacks , with reports of nuisance birds being kicked to death and lured into the paths of cars			1
@entity42 spokesman @entity200 said most run - ins between humans and seagulls were simply the result of birds innocently trying to protect their chicks			1
he said : ‘ this is the time of year when chicks begin to hatch			2
of course , they remain flightless for some time but this period normally only lasts for a few weeks			0
‘ during that time , the gulls become very aggressive towards humans			0
‘ there ’s been an increased number of phone calls to us this year , more so than the past eight or so years from the @entity20 area , and we ’re not sure why			2
‘ but once the young have begun to fly , it usually calms down			0
i think the issue will pass very soon			0
