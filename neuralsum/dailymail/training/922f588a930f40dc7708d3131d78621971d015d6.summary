former @entity1 gov. @entity0 , the @entity2 presidential nominee in 2012 , told a small group of loyalists on friday that he 's considering another run for the @entity6			1
the move will throw the @entity2 's fast - coalescing race into chaos as it now must make room for both @entity0 and former @entity12 gov. @entity11 , two moderates seen as competing for the same heavyweight donors			1
' everybody in here can go tell your friends that i 'm considering a run , ' @entity0 told donors during the get - together in @entity23 , according to a source who spoke to @entity25			1
a longtime @entity0 camp insider contacted by @entity27 expressed surprise at the news and had no knowledge of the event			0
the @entity51 reported friday that @entity0 met wednesday in @entity52 with a select group of aides from his 2012 campaign , including counselors @entity56 and @entity58 , press secretary @entity59 and policy director @entity60			1
the @entity51 interviewed @entity61 , @entity0 ’s former national finance co-chairman , who attended the @entity23 meeting on friday			2
' i believe @entity0 is too much of a patriot to sit on the sidelines and concede the presidency to @entity38 or @entity67 when he knows that he can fix the country , ' @entity61 told the newspaper			2
' he traveled the country in 2014 , met with voters , met with citizens , and i think at the end of the day he believes he could actually make a difference			0
' another person in attendance said that @entity0 answered a question about his intentions by saying , ' people ask if i really want to be president			2
... i 've run twice			0
yeah , i want to be president			0
' @entity0 ran in 2008 , losing the @entity2 nomination to @entity84 sen. @entity83 , and in 2012 , becoming the @entity2 nominee but failing to beat president @entity35			1
the @entity88 politician 's ties to big business caused him trouble three years ago in the harsh spotlight of an unsympathetic mass - media			1
another @entity0 run has long been rumored but never substantiated , and he has outpaced the field in polls where his name is included among @entity2 hopefuls			1
' at one point during the meeting , ' the @entity98 reported , ' one of the attendees asked mr. @entity0 if he wanted to be president , a person present said			2
the 2012 nominee said , yes , of course			0
' the meeting was reportedly scheduled weeks ago in december , long before @entity11 announced the formation of a leadership pac – the first step toward a likely candidacy			1
@entity0 has no timetable for a decision , according to the @entity98 , but said the domestic @entity113 economy and the tumultuous foreign affairs environment in which the @entity35 @entity6 has made some stumbles , are on his mind as he mulls his future			1
his first hurdle , however , may be persuading his wife @entity43 to withstand another bruising campaign cycle			0
she seemed to slam the door on the idea in october , telling the @entity123 that she and @entity0 were ' done ' running for president ' completely			1
' ' not only @entity0 and i are done , but the kids are done , ' she said , referring to the couple 's five sons			2
done , ' mrs. @entity0 added			0
but other statements from the politician himself have left prognosticators scratching their heads			0
never went away : despite his 2012 presidential loss , @entity0 has stayed in party politics by campaigning for other candidates including @entity140 @entity139 runner - up @entity137 in this october photo he said in august that while he had no plans to run again , ' circumstances can change			1
' then his wife suggested he could make a political comeback – but only if @entity11 stayed out of the race			2
in october he swatted away a scrum of reporters in @entity149 , where he was campaigning for @entity139 majority leader @entity151 's re-election , telling them , ' i 'm not running , i 'm not planning on running and i expect to be supporting one of the many people who i think are looking at this race			1
' he repeated the refrain days later in an interview with @entity157			0
' i 'm not letting my head go there , ' @entity0 said with cameras rolling			2
' where i 'm focused on making sure we nominate the right person , who cares about the kinds of issues i care about			0
' by november he was re-engaged in policy issues , taking a direct swipe at president @entity35 for what he called an ' extra-constitutional ' move to mainstream millions of illegal immigrants			1
following through , he warned , would be ' poking an eye of the @entity2 leaders in @entity176			0
' ' the president has got to learn that he lost this last election round , ' @entity0 said on the @entity180 program @entity181			2
' the @entity113 people spoke loud and clear			0
let those people who were elected come together with a piece of legislation on this and other topics , and then he has a chance to veto them if he does n't like them			0
' ' but the idea of violating the principles of our constitution , which is a balance of power , checks and balances , that is something which is wrong			0
' in july amid an @entity35 public - opinion malaise accelerated by the release of five @entity201 soldiers in exchange for a captive @entity204 sergeant , a @entity197 / @entity196 poll found that @entity0 would win a do - over election against the president			1
@entity0 would have taken 53 percent of the popular vote to @entity35 's 44 percent , in that snapshot in time			1
@entity209 - killer : former @entity12 gov. @entity11 ( center ) is already beating the bushes to lock in donors who might otherwise choose to help @entity0 regain his political power in the @entity2 weeks earlier a @entity215 / @entity214 found that in the critical early primary state of @entity140 , @entity0 crushed his @entity2 competition when his name was added to the field			1
his numbers there emerged nearly as dominant as @entity38 's on the @entity223 side , capturing 39 per cent of the vote			0
@entity226 gov. @entity225 and @entity149 sen. @entity227 were each a distant second with a 7 per cent showing			0
a followup poll by the same company in november found the margin had narrowed , with @entity0 at 30 per cent and @entity227 at 11			0
nationally , @entity197 and @entity196 found in early december that @entity0 has a narrower lead among @entity2 , winning the support of about 20 per cent			2
@entity11 placed third in that poll at 9 per cent , one point behind former pediatric neurosurgeon dr. @entity237			0
but that was before @entity11 publicly expressed an interest in running – and before @entity237 was embroiled in a plagiarism scandal surrounding his 2012 book ' @entity242			1
' in july , @entity0 's fellow @entity244 @entity243 , a hard - charging @entity2 congressman , declared on @entity245 that @entity0 is ' actually going to run , and i think he will be the next president of the @entity113			1
' ' he ’s been proven right on a lot of stuff , ' said @entity243 .			0

former @entity1 *governor* ran for the @entity6 in 2008 and 2012
he was the @entity2 's nominee three years ago but lost to president @entity35
' everybody in here can go tell your friends that i 'm considering a run , ' he reportedly told a group of donors on friday
meeting was scheduled in december , long before @entity11 announced he had formed a leadership pac to raise money
move will bring chaos to the potential 2016 @entity2 field as @entity0 and former @entity12 gov. @entity11 appeal to the same donor base
*flashback* : @entity0 said in october that ' i 'm not running , i 'm not planning on running ' – and his wife said days later that ' @entity0 and i are done '
@entity278 and @entity140 polls show @entity0 leading the @entity2 field if his name is included
