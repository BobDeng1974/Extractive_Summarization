@entity1 faces another five years of ultra-low interest rates in a blow to millions of savers , the @entity0 hinted yesterday			1
@entity5 , the @entity0 ’s chief economist , said officials are in ‘ no rush ’ to raise rates having pegged them at a record low of 0.5 per cent since the depths of the recession in march 2009			1
he said that when rates do start to rise – which investors do not think will happen until mid- 2016 – it could be by just half a percentage point a year ‘ for several years ’			0
@entity5 , chief economist at the @entity0 , said there is ' no rush ' to raise interest rates , adding that the new norm will be ' 2 or 4 per cent ' compared to 5 per cent pre-recession this means interest rates may not reach 2.5 per cent until early 2020 – half the average of 5 per cent seen in the decade before the financial crisis			1
the eurozone is caught in a debt trap that could lead to another ‘ lost decade ’ for the region ’s economy , @entity26 warned last night			2
the governor of the @entity0 said ‘ now is not the time for half measures ’ as he accused leaders in the currency bloc of being too ‘ timid ’ when dealing with the region ’s problems			0
he called on the eurozone to ease austerity and urged fiscal union to transfer taxes from rich to poor countries			0
‘ we are in no rush to raise rates , the recovery is taking hold nicely , the last thing we want to do is knock the stuffing out of that , ’ said mr @entity5			2
the ‘ new normal ’ for rates in the coming years will be around 2 to 4 per cent , he added			1
more cautious projections by investors suggest interest rates will not even reach 1.5 per cent before 2020			1
this would prolong the misery of low returns for @entity1 ’s savers , but would be welcomed by over-stretched borrowers struggling with mortgage repayments			0
@entity0 governor @entity26 admitted last week that low interest rates help borrowers ‘ at the expense of savers ’			1
for much of last year , it was predicted that rates would rise to 0.75 per cent by early 2015 as the economy recovered			0
further hikes were then expected			0
but record low inflation – dragged down by the falling price of food and fuel – and signs of further trouble in the eurozone mean they are now expected to remain fixed until july next year			0
economist predict that interest rates could still be as low as 1.5 per cent by 2020 , causing pain for the nation 's savers , but proving a boost to borrowers speaking to the @entity86 newspaper @entity85 , mr @entity5 said interest rates will be unlikely to return to the sort of levels seen before the financial crisis in the near future			1
‘ people might be fearful that we could go back to the sorts of levels we saw in the 80s or 90s which were 4 , 5 , 6 or 7 per cent rates , ’ he said			2
‘ we are clear that even when we are through this adjustment and rates are starting to rise , we do n’t really see rates getting back to those levels			0

@entity5 said ' new norm ' for rates could be between 2 and 4 per cent
but economists suggest base rate may be as low as 1.5 per cent in 2020
governor @entity26 admitted that low rate was ' at expense of savers '
