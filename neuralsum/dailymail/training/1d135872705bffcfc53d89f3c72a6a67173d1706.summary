however , in january this year the entire fleet of @entity81 worldwide was grounded after two planes were forced to make emergency landings within the space of a week			2
embarrassment : last week , a @entity2 on its way to @entity18 from @entity9 was forced to land in @entity17 delivery line : a queue of @entity81 waiting to be transported to customers in @entity90 the problem was traced to the jets ' lithium - ion batteries , which were only declared safe last month			1
