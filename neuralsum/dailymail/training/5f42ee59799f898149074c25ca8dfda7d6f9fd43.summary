a couple who refused to reveal how their three - month - old son sustained ' horrific ' injuries have been condemned by a judge for their possible ' conspiracy of silence ' which allowed them to avoid jail			1
@entity9 of @entity10 , @entity11 , and her former partner @entity12 of @entity13 were both handed eight - month suspended sentences despite admitting child cruelty against their son @entity16			1
@entity19 @entity18 heard how the baby was left with multiple fractures to his skull , spine and ribs and also suffered multiple brain and retinal haemorrhages			1
@entity16 was also only admitted to hospital five days after the injuries emerged			1
@entity12 , 30 , ( pictured left in wheelchair ) and @entity9 ( pictured far right in right picture ) were condemned for their possible ' conspiracy of silence ' after failing to reveal how their son was left with ' horrific ' injuries but neither parents would reveal what happened to the boy , despite the court being told the injuries were consistent with ' shaking , twisting , bending and hitting '			1
instead , both defendants pleaded guilty to child cruelty on the basis that neither of them had sought medical assistance for @entity16 's head injury			1
the court was told how 30 - year - old @entity12 even tried to suggest that the injuries were inflicted by @entity16 's twin while they were playfully ' flicking each other with their hands '			1
handing them an eight - month jail term suspended for two years , judge @entity50 said he had been ' unimpressed ' by the couple 's silence			1
but he said he was only able to sentence the pair on the basis they had failed to obtain medical help			2
he said : ' i am unimpressed by the silence over whichever of you knows what has happened			2
it may even be a conspiracy of silence between the two of you , both of who knows what has happened			0
' the injuries were appalling and inflicted over five days			2
i have to sentence on the basis that you should have taken the child to hospital			2
' the court heard that @entity9 , 41 , had claimed she had come home from work on december 11 , 2012 and seen a bruise on the child 's forehead			1
the court heard the baby had also been ' generally lethargic ' and vomiting			0
he had also not wet his nappy in the days before he was admitted to hospital			2
@entity9 covered her head after she left @entity86 today five days later , on december 16 , @entity12 - said to be the carer of the children - called @entity89 and explained his son 's symptoms			1
@entity16 was then taken to hospital by ambulance , where doctors noticed the bruising to his head , the court was told			1
prosecutor @entity98 said : ' the doctor advised he needed to be placed on a drip			0
' a senior doctor immediately noticed something was wrong , significant bruising to the left side of the temple and asked how it was obtained , he described a " vague " explanation , something about the twins banging heads			2
' a further ct scan showed fractures to each side of @entity16 's skull and acute haemorrhages			1
medics also detected a collection of bruises			0
a full skeletal survey further showed multiple skull fractures , fractures to the spine and five rib fractures			0
there were also back and ankle injuries , as well as haemorrhages behind the eye , the court heard			0
during the case , it emerged that @entity16 's skull injuries were in keeping with being hit against a flat surface or something striking his head			1
meanwhile , the hemorrhages were in keeping with the baby being shaken , while the fractured ribs could have been caused from forceable compression to his chest , the court was told			0
the spinal injuries were consistent with the child being bent or allowed to fall heavily , experts said			0
mr @entity98 said that doctors had unanimously agreed that the injuries were not accidental and would have caused the baby ' such pain and discomfort ' that the parents , ' should have known and intervened if they had known the perpetrator '			2
mr @entity98 added : ' both were arrested and interviewed and gave entirely implausible evidence			0
@entity12 said he had slipped on the ice whilst holding @entity16			1
' the court heard that @entity12 suggested @entity16 and his twin could have ' headbutted ' one another while playing			1
he further suggested that he had rolled out of the @entity158 basket , but medical experts dismissed the claims			0
during the hearing , @entity161 said that @entity9 had assisted the prosecution in becoming a witness after pleading during her trial			0
in her basis of plea , the prosecutor @entity98 told the court that @entity9 had said she had not been aware of the underlying injuries but accepted that she should have sought medical assistance after the bruising had occurred			1
@entity12 , 30 , had previously denied child neglect but admitted the charge before standing trial			2
@entity19 @entity18 heard how @entity16 was not taken to hospital until five days after his injuries were noticed			1
both parents admitted child neglect for failing to seek medical attention for @entity12 , @entity181 said : ' regrettably we will never know who caused these injuries , not to the criminal standards			1
there is no doubt that this is an extremely sad case			0
' he argued that the duo , who are now separated , should be given the same distinction in sentencing , adding that the child had made ' a good recovery '			0
in passing sentence @entity194 said that their basis of plea had been the failure to take the child to hospital			2
he said : ' in the five days or so leading up to admission at @entity204 it must have been obvious that the child was severely unwell			0
' it is obvious to any decent person that something urgent needed to be done			0
having said that i have to be true to the basis of plea in that you entered , namely that you failed to take the child to hospital			0
' i am and i should make it clear that i am unimpressed by the silence by which one of knows what happens , it may even be a conspiracy of silence between the two of you and both of you know what happened			0
' i can only sentence you on what you have entered and what can be proved			0
' the injuries were appalling , inflicted over a period of say five days but i have to sentence you on the basis that you should have taken the child to hospital			1
' the sentence of imprisonment which this case justifies is in months and not years			0
i am prepared to suspend , the only reason is to be honest with the basis of plea			0

@entity238 left with multiple fractures and severe brain haemorrhages
but he was only taken to hospital five days after his injuries were noticed
@entity9 , 41 , and @entity12 , 30 , did not say how injuries caused
@entity12 even suggested the cause was @entity16 's twin playfully ' flicking ' him
both parents handed eight - month suspended sentence for child cruelty
@entity255 said he was ' unimpressed ' with silence and that he could only sentence them for not seeking medical help
