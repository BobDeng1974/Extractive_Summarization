@entity8 played a key part in the victory , featuring in two doubles successes , while @entity12 claimed a singles win , but victory was far from straightforward			1
@entity0 faltered in all three rubbers but eventually pulled through to book a final clash with defending champions @entity18 at the @entity19			2
key player : @entity8 and his wife @entity21 put in an important performance , as they often do for @entity0 , to help guide their country to a final against @entity18 @entity8 and wife @entity26 laid the platform for victory as they overcame @entity30 and @entity31 2 - 1			1

@entity12 , ranked 27 , then overcame world number 22 @entity49 21 - 16 21 - 19 for a vital win , but he too had alarms , noticeably in losing eight out of 10 points in one run in the first game			1
he also surrendered a three - point lead in the second before edging back ahead			0
@entity8 and @entity57 then completed the job with a 2 - 1 men 's doubles win over @entity30 and @entity61 , but only after coming from behind in another energy - sapping encounter			1
one rally in the second game contained 82 strokes as both sets of players pushed hard , but ultimately @entity0 prevailed 12 - 21 21 - 13 21 - 16			0
