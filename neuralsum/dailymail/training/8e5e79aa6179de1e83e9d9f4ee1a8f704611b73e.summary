menace : the @entity2 moth has infected the @entity4 village they came in the dead of night , attracted by a blaze of light so vast it could be seen from miles away			1
to an inquisitive moth , the @entity4 village must have looked like paradise - 9,000 brand new wardrobes , each containing enough clothing to see athletes through two weeks of the @entity15			1
or , to put it another way , a fortnight of prime packed lunches for @entity2 and its pesky cousin pellionella			2
for the olympic park is at the centre of an area infested with fabric - chomping moths - and @entity25 was pinpointed yesterday as one of the worst hit areas in the @entity28			2
do n't even dare to imagine what might happen should they chance to munch on the women 's beach volleyball bikinis			2
perish the thought that @entity28 athletes will parade proudly in uniforms that invite critics to describe our opening ceremony as moth - eaten			1
and forget the fact that so much unpalatable lycra and man - made ' performance fibres ' will deter the larvae of the common clothes moth ( bisselliella ) or the case - bearing clothes moth ( pellionella )			1
with this many people concentrated into such a small area , there is enough grub here for a plague of biblical proportions			2
the revelation that the @entity56 's recently assigned @entity55 postcode is a hot - spot for moth invasion came from anti-moth and homecare company @entity59			1
it monitors pest control sales daily to determine which areas are most affected			0
on a moth map of the @entity28 , @entity25 is plotted at the epicentre of what it described as an escalating ' epidemic '			1
figures suggest the problem is 40 times bigger than in @entity72 , for example ; nearly 400 times worse than in @entity74 ; and greater than in the whole of @entity76			0
on the menu ? members of @entity79 model their @entity4 kit as they arrive at the @entity81 yesterday @entity83 pickings : the @entity4 village has 9,000 brand new wardrobes , each containing enough clothing to see athletes through two weeks of the @entity15 ' they show no respect for @entity91 suits , @entity93 jumpers or athletes ' outfits , ' said the firms moth expert , @entity97			1
' anything they can get their teeth into - jackets , trousers , underpants - will become a casualty			0
' @entity105 and the south east saw a big increase in moth populations recently because of unseasonal or prolonged spells of cold , wet weather			1
that meant homes , offices ( and flats in the @entity4 village ) kept windows closed and heat on - perfect conditions for moths to lay eggs that turn into cloth - eating larvae			0
females can lay 40 eggs in three weeks , producing larvae which may carry on chomping for up to a year before pupating			0
no doubt granny would simply have shaken out the clothes and stocked up on pongy mothballs			0
do n't even think about it ! members of the @entity130 beach volleyball team during a training session at @entity132 yesterday by the time athletes notice any adult moths flying out of their wardrobes , however , the seeds of sartorial disaster will already have been sown			0
ironically , the @entity25 stadium boats that ' sustainable development ' has provided new habitats for a host of species , including the toadflax brocade moth , whose larvae spurn athletics gear in favour of the plant from which it takes its name			1
but even recently revamped security measures , plus surface to air missiles , appear to not to have stopped the airborne cloth - destroyers infiltrating			0
@entity4 officials said yesterday they had ' not been overwhelmed ' by complaints about masticated clothing , or by reports of munching sounds from inside athletes ' wardrobes ( which , it is understood , have no moth protection )			1
but one did report that an @entity165 athlete spent an uncomfortable night swatting moths after leaving his balcony doors open and dozing off with the light on			0
finally , a terrifying thought			0
just where did those big holes in the @entity4 rings come from ?			2
