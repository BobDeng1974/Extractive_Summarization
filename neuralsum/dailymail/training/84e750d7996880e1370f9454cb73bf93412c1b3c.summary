group captain @entity0 , 54 , claimed that she was wrongly passed over for a top @entity2 job in favour of a male colleague with less experience than her the @entity2 's most senior nurse who lost out on a top job to a man has won a sexual discrimination case against the @entity10			1
group captain @entity0 , 54 , took the @entity2 to tribunal after she was passed over for promotion in favour of a male doctor who had three - and - a - half years ' fewer service than her			1
today , in what is being hailed a landmark ruling , group capt @entity0 ' claim that the @entity10 had discriminated against her when recruiting for a senior role because of her gender was upheld			1
the tribunal , which found that just six of the 470 top jobs in the @entity2 were held by women last year , agreed with group capt @entity0 ' claim and awarded her damages			1
she brought the case in july 2011 after being passed over for the position as @entity2 candidate for the tri-service role of commodore of the @entity32			0
as a registered nurse and midwife who had served in the @entity2 since 1984 , and who had been a group captain since 2003 , group capt @entity0 expected to win the role			1
but despite her experience , and her being recommended for promotion to a senior non-nursing role based on her experience , the post went to group capt @entity42			2
the 1 * level role went to @entity44 despite him having three - and - a - half years fewer service as a @entity47			1
group captain @entity0 claimed the @entity10 had breached the @entity49 by discriminating against her because of her gender when recruiting for a role for which she recommended and well - qualified			1
the tribunal was told that it was the @entity2 ’s procedure to fill medical 1 * roles that were theoretically open to doctors and nurses only with doctors			0
the @entity2 only had six women in its 470 top jobs last year , the tribunal heard in its ruling , the tribunal panel , led by employment judge @entity62 , criticised the @entity2 for this practice and also the low number of women in top ranks overall - amounting to between 1 % and 1.3 % of the total			1
group capt @entity0 said she was pleased with the decision , saying : ' following this decision , i hope that nurses in the @entity2 and the wider @entity73 will have the opportunity to aspire to , and attain , more senior posts			1
' i hope that nurses will also gain due recognition for their leadership , commitment and professionalism			0
' this judgment represents an opportunity for the @entity73 to scrutinise internal processes and practices and shatter glass ceilings			0
the tribunal panel criticised air vice marshal @entity86 , now retired , for his ignorance of legislation ' it should be used as a platform to ensure that appointments are made with regard to merit and competencies , and not with regard to a person ’s gender or their membership of a professional body			0
' the panel also included scathing criticism of several senior officers , including air vice-marshal @entity104 who gave the promotion board a ' partisan and not unbiased ' assessment of @entity108 , who was under his command at the time			0
air vice marshal @entity86 , who is now retired but was in charge of @entity2 personnel at the time , was also criticised for his lack of knowledge of discrimination legislation , an ignorance that left the tribunal panel ' incredulous '			2
' viewed with an objective eye against the job specification , we have considered all the evidence and find that for a number of reasons the claimant was not only equal to group captain @entity42 but that an objective review of her appraisals and those of group captain @entity42 would have led to the claimant being considered as the properly preferred candidate of the @entity2 , ' it wrote in its ruling			1
' while the respondents acknowledge that both the claimant and group captain @entity42 were competent candidates for the selection ... the respondents assert that group captain @entity42 was the most likely to succeed in competition with the other candidates put forward by the other services and therefore he was selected on that basis			2
' we consider such a rationale to be entirely subjective and unsustainable in the evidence before us and we conclude that the claimant was not selected because of her sex			0
' group capt @entity0 was supported by the @entity146 in her claim			2
@entity148 , its executive director of nursing and service delivery , said : ' this is a landmark case , and bodes well for the future of nursing careers within the @entity73			0
' it is n’t right for female staff to be placed at a disadvantage when they get to a senior level			2
' the tribunal was clear - not only was @entity0 suitable to be put forward for this role , but an objective review would have led to her being considered as the preferred candidate			0
' we hope that the @entity10 will take on board the recommendations which come out of this tribunal so that the talents of female officers and nurses in particular are valued and harnessed in the future			0
