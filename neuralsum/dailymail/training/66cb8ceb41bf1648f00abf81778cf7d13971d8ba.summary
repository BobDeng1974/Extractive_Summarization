by @entity0 flight fares are set to rise as airlines look to recover costs on payouts to passengers for delays in the wake of the @entity9 court ruling			1
one senior industry figure suggested fares could rise by as much as £ 5 , with charter prices likely to increase by more than scheduled services			1
last week a passenger seeking compensation for a delay on a flight six years ago was celebrating after @entity18 ruled in favour of a claim against @entity21			1
rising costs : air fares are set to increase as more passenger 's claim money for delayed flights @entity27 was awarded £ 975 by a county court but @entity9 has appealed , arguing the @entity29 , which says there is a two - year limit on claims			1
it was the second ruling on passenger rights and @entity35 261 this month			2
in a case against @entity37 , @entity18 had ruled that a technical fault that caused a delay could not be classed as an ‘ extraordinary circumstance ’			2
now airlines say they are being forced to recover the costs of handling the claims by increasing fares			2
lawyer @entity45 of @entity46 told @entity47 : ' it is inevitable air fares will rise as the costs of handling these claims increase			1
' there is simply no other way for airlines to recover the costs			0
@entity55 implemented a regulation 261 levy on tickets and , while unpopular at first , it has gathered growing sympathy among airlines			0

' time limit : @entity9 believe passengers should only be able to claim within a two - year period a @entity77 spokesman told @entity78 : ‘ it ’s difficult to estimate what this might cost passengers			1
it ’s up to each airline			0
' ‘ as the @entity62 's most on - time holiday airline , at @entity21 our focus continues to be ensuring that our customers reach their destination safely and promptly			0
‘ we believe that it is reasonable to expect that those who perceive they have suffered a real loss as a result of an unfortunate delay should be able to make their claim within two years			2
' we also continue to believe that the law stipulates this and we are therefore surprised by today ’s judgment			0
‘ if unchallenged , this judgment could have a significant impact on the entire airline industry and specifically upon the price that all air travellers would need to pay for their flights			0
' we therefore confirm that it is our intention to seek an appeal to the @entity109			0
