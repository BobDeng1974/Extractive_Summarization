@entity1 governor @entity0 addressed the @entity2 at the @entity3 , @entity4 today sharing the pound is ‘ incompatible ’ with independence , the @entity1 governor @entity0 said today			1
mr @entity0 said a separate @entity7 could not forge a currency union with the rest of the @entity10 because it needed a shared central bank and controls over public spending			1
the bank chief , speaking at the @entity15 in @entity4 , warned that without these in place @entity7 would risk a @entity18 - style crisis			2
mr @entity0 ’s remarks are a significant intervention against the @entity22 ’s plans for independence			2
@entity7 ’s first minister @entity24 has insisted that the government is bluffing that it will block a formal currency union after independence			1
the ‘ no ’ campaign against intervention will hope to use mr @entity0 ’s remarks to convince wavering @entity7 voters that they risk losing the pound in the event of independence			1
in january mr @entity0 warned that a currency union – like the @entity18 - ‘ requires some ceding of national sovereignty ’			1
today , he went even further , declaring : ‘ a currency union is incompatible with sovereignty			2
’ unions in favour of @entity7 staying within the @entity10 welcomed the comments			0
@entity44 , general secretary of the @entity45 , said : ‘ the comments were a breath of fresh air			0
‘ people keep talking about whether there is a @entity51 or @entity52 , but there are n't any , because it is incompatible , as the governor has made clear			0
’ mr @entity0 said there had to be three things in place to make a currency union work			1
he said these were the free movement of goods and services across the different parts of the currency , a banking union underpinned by common institutions such as a central bank , and controls on spending			0
the subject of currency has been a political battleground after @entity73 said earlier this summer that an independent @entity7 could not keep the pound			0
the chancellor said : ‘ no ifs , no buts , we will not share the pound if @entity7 separated from the rest of the @entity10			0
’ that position has been backed by both @entity85 and the @entity86			0
@entity22 leaders have refused to offer a ‘ @entity51 ’ alternative to a continued formal currency union			2
mr @entity73 's threat to block a currency union was trumped this weekend by a stark warning from the @entity85 leader @entity93 that border guards could be deployed in the event of a ' yes ' vote			1
mr @entity0 ( left ) with @entity15 general secretary @entity97 ( right ) in @entity4 today @entity7 first minister @entity24 has dismissed the threats from @entity100 to block a currency union he said : ‘ if you do n’t want borders , vote to stay in the @entity10			1
' asked whether that would mean him introducing border guards and passport checks if he was prime minister , mr @entity93 warned : ‘ it would have to be looked at			2
’ and mr @entity93 ’s spokesman added : ‘ the last time i looked there were two sides to the border – and we would be in charge of one of them			0
it would be up to us , not mr @entity24 , to secure our northern border			0
