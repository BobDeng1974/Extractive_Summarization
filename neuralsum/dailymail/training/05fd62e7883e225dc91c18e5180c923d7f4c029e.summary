@entity1 hackers have accessed designs for more than two dozen @entity4 weapons systems and stolen the blueprints for @entity7 's new spy headquarters which has n't even been opened yet			1
these latest strikes come after months of numerous computer security breaches involving @entity1 hackers as the ongoing cyber war between @entity1 and the @entity13 intensifies			1
hackers have now ' compromised ' @entity4 designs for combat aircraft and ships , as well as missile defenses vital for @entity20 , @entity21 and the @entity22 , it has emerged			1
among the weapons listed in the report were the advanced @entity38 missile system , the @entity41 's @entity40 ballistic missile defense systems , the @entity43 fighter jet , the @entity44 , the @entity46 helicopter and the @entity47			0
the report did not specify the extent or time of the cyber-thefts or indicate if they involved computer networks of the @entity4 government , contractors or subcontractors			0
but the espionage would give @entity1 knowledge that could be exploited in a conflict , such as knocking out communications and corrupting data , the @entity30 said			0
it also could speed @entity62 's development of @entity1 defense technology			2
@entity1 hackers stole plans for confidential @entity4 weapons systems including the @entity47 pictured here in a report to @entity68 earlier this month , the @entity33 said @entity1 was using espionage to modernize its military and that its hacking was a serious concern			2
it said the @entity4 government had been the target of hacking that appeared to be ' attributable directly to the @entity1 government and military '			2
@entity1 has dismissed as groundless both the @entity33 report and a february report by the @entity4 computer security company @entity80 , which said a secretive @entity1 military unit was probably behind a series of hacking attacks targeting the @entity4 that had stolen data from 100 companies			1
meanwhile , news reports in @entity7 claim hackers linked to @entity1 stole the floorplans of the $ 630 million headquarters for the @entity29 , the country 's domestic spy agency			1
' compromised ' : a v - 22 osprey pictured here is among the aircrafts for which plans were stolen the attack through the computers of a construction contractor exposed not only building layouts , but also the location of communication and computer networks			0
@entity7 security analyst @entity102 told the @entity103 in the report that such information made the yet to be completed spy headquarters vulnerable to future cyber attacks			2
' you can start constructing your own wiring diagrams , where the linkages are through telephone connections , through wi - fi connections , which rooms are likely to be the ones that are used for sensitive conversations , how to surreptitiously put devices into the walls of those rooms , ' said @entity102			0
the building is designed to be part of a global electronic intelligence gathering network which includes the @entity4 and the @entity123 , but its construction has been plagued by delays and cost blowouts , with some builders blaming late design changes on cyber attacks			1
the @entity103 report said the @entity1 hacking was part of a growing wave of cyber attacks against business and military targets in the close @entity4 ally			1
it said the hackers also stole confidential information from the @entity141 , which houses the overseas spy agency the @entity142 and had targeted local companies , including steel - manufacturer @entity144 , and military and civilian communications manufacturer @entity145 @entity1 hackers allegedly associated with the country 's government stole @entity4 missile plans for weapons such as @entity38 missile batteries ( pictured here ) the influential @entity154 said the hacking was a ' security blunder of epic proportions ' and called for an inquiry , but the government refused to confirm the breach			1
prime minister @entity161 said the reports were ' inaccurate ' , but declined to say how			0
@entity7 officials , like those in the @entity4 and other @entity166 nations , have made cyber attacks a security priority following a growing number of attacks of the resource rich country , mostly blamed on @entity1			1
despite being one of @entity62 's major trade partners , the country is seen by @entity1 as the southern fulcrum of the @entity4 military pivot to the @entity177 and in 2011 agreed to host thousands of @entity4 @entity178 in near - permanent rotation			1
@entity7 is a major buyer for @entity4 weapons systems and is one of the largest overseas customers for the @entity184 manufactured @entity47 , as well as for @entity186 's @entity185 and associated weapons systems			0
@entity1 telecommunications giant @entity188 was last year barred from bidding for construction contracts on a new @entity7 high - speed broadband network amid fears of cyber espionage			2
hacked : the @entity194 office in @entity195			0
the newspaper has reported that its computer system was breached by @entity1 hackers the @entity199 said in march that it had been targeted by cyber attacks , but no data had been lost or systems compromised amid reports the hackers had tried to access intelligence on @entity207 wealthy nations negotiations			1
@entity1 has dismissed the allegations by @entity7 media that @entity1 hackers have stolen the blueprints for the new @entity7 spy headquarters			1
foreign ministry spokesman @entity212 said : ' @entity1 pays high attention to cybersecurity issues , and is firmly apposed to all forms of hacker attacks			0
groundless accusations will not help solve this issue			0
' the risk of cyber hacking came to the forefront of the news agenda after @entity1 hackers were accused of being responsible for hacking the @entity30 and the @entity194 earlier this year			2
and just last month , hacking attacks on the servers of @entity227 broadcasters and banks originated from an ip address based in @entity1			0
but @entity1 says it is impossible to tell the true origin of cyber-attacks , and accuses hostile forces of blaming it out of prejudice or a desire to put @entity62 on the defensive			0
under attack : the @entity30 spent most of 2012 trying to deal with @entity1 hackers who infiltrated their computer network			0
