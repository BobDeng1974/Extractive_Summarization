pretty in a shimmering navy silk cocktail dress , @entity1 's @entity0 looked every inch the royal mother - to - be as she arrived for an event in @entity6 hand - in - hand with her husband			1
the royal , 36 , is expecting twins in december and her bump was clearly visible as she made her way into an awards ceremony held in honour of her late mother - in - law , @entity15			1
@entity1 's ruler , @entity18 , and his wife have spent the last week in the @entity20 on behalf of the @entity21 , which supports up - and - coming actors			1
not long now : princess @entity0 is nearly seven months pregnant and due to give birth in december but after it was revealed that the @entity1 royals were expecting twins last week , all eyes have been on princess @entity0 's bump			1
clearly unfazed by the attention , @entity0 looked relaxed and happy and beamed at well - wishers as she arrived for the event			1
for his part , @entity18 was every inch the protective father - to - be , clutching his wife 's hand and smiling solicitously as he ushered her into the venue			2
the @entity1 royal couple are currently in @entity39 on behalf of the @entity21 and have attended several receptions , including the @entity6 ceremony , since arriving			1
while much of their schedule has focused on the work of the @entity21 , the couple also took time out to visit a children 's centre in @entity47 on saturday			1
all smiles : the couple smiled at each other as they arrived for the @entity21 event tour : the couple have spent the last week in the @entity20 , attending events for the @entity21 there , the couple were introduced to @entity57 , the fourth and final wife of singer @entity58 , with @entity18 gallantly planting a kiss on mrs @entity57 's hand			1
and mrs @entity57 is n't the only big name well - wisher to meet the couple during their tour of @entity39			2
as news of the impending arrival of twins broke , the couple were rubbing shoulders with director @entity70 and @entity72 star @entity71 , at a gala supper in @entity74			2
the day before , the couple had lunched with another set of a-listers , among them @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80			2
the high - profile events were all for the @entity21 , which awards fellowships and grants to promising up - and - comers in the entertainment industry , including dancers and actors			1
@entity18 is the vice-chairman on the board of the organisation , and is often in attendance at its events , one of which is an awards ceremony			1
charity : on saturday , the couple spent the day at the @entity98 in @entity47 @entity99 : during the visit , @entity18 planted a kiss on @entity57 's hand princess @entity0 , who is nearly seven months pregnant , is also involved with the @entity21 's activities and has a charity of her own , the @entity105 , which focuses on sport , swimming in particular			1
but with twins on the way , talk has now turned to the succession , with pundits left contemplating the question of how the birth of multiple babies might affect the succession			2
according to @entity1 's constitution , the first - born baby is the closest in line to the throne , with priority given to males			1
but should both babies be boys - or indeed girls - working out which is first could prove a constitutional headache , with some arguing that the second baby born should be first in line as that child was conceived first			0
looking good : for the visit to the children 's centre in @entity47 , @entity0 was pretty in gold and cream succession : since the couple announced twins were on the way , talk has turned to the succession this is not the first time that the question of @entity1 's succession has become vexed , with prince @entity143 quietly changing @entity1 's constitutional laws in 2002 to allow his daughters , @entity147 and @entity148 , and their children to inherit the throne should @entity18 fail to marry and produce an heir			1
now , however , those changes are obsolete with not one but two heirs on the way - much to the excitement of @entity18			0
in june , the royal told the @entity156 that he and his wife were ' overjoyed ' , ' thrilled ' and ' very excited ' about the impending arrival of their child - or children , as they are now known to be			0
glowing : princess @entity0 was glamorous in a floor - length white dress as she stepped out in @entity74 looking good : @entity0 had worn a glamorous sparkly top for a lunchtime reception in @entity74 a day earlier for charity : the high - profile event awards fellowships and grants to promising up - and - comers in the entertainment industry , including dancers and actors			1
pictured : @entity0 with @entity79 the delighted father - to - be also spoke of the precautions the pair were taking , adding that they are ' taking every cautious step to make sure everything goes well '			2
@entity18 , 56 , has two other children - daughter @entity178 , born in 1992 to @entity20 @entity179 , and @entity180 , born in 2003 to @entity181 air hostess , @entity18			0
under @entity1 's inheritance laws , neither of @entity18 's two illegitimate children have no claim to royal titles and are not considered his official heirs			1
his daughter @entity188 was born in @entity39 to a former waitress with whom @entity18 had a brief fling			0
now 22 , she recently graduated from @entity191 in @entity192			0
his son @entity193 , now ten , lives with his mother , a former @entity195 hostess from @entity181 , on the @entity196			0
@entity18 reportedly demanded dna tests for both children before accepting paternity			0
with an average of 3.5 sets of twins born per 1,000 pregnancies , an instant family of two babies - even royal ones - is n't unusual			2
@entity207 , @entity208 is one royal parent of twins , who with wife princess @entity210 welcomed @entity211 and @entity212 in 2013			2
another is crown prince frederik of denmark and his wife @entity215 , who became parents to prince @entity218 and princess @entity219 in 2011			0
prince @entity220 , @entity221 is yet another royal father of twins , following the birth of @entity224 , @entity225 and prince @entity226 , @entity228 , to his wife @entity229 in 2010			2
but although royal twins are fairly frequent among @entity232 dynasties , among them the @entity1 couple , @entity234 royals are an entirely different story with just one set born in the last 2,000 years			1
born to @entity240 of @entity241 and his wife @entity242 in 1430 , @entity238 and @entity239 were the first and only twins born to @entity234 royal parents			0
tragically though , @entity238 , the eldest of the two , died before reaching one - with his younger brother later taking the throne of @entity241 as @entity248 during his marriage to @entity215 , @entity239 sired no fewer than seven children , all of them in separate pregnancies			0
despite the lack of @entity234 royal twins , odds have shortened on another set of royal twins - belonging to the @entity221 and @entity257 - being announced			0
while the @entity1 rules of succession are clear , the @entity234 rules are n't set in stone , although as the new baby - or babies - will be spares , the question of who inherits what is less vexed			1
in theory , with @entity269 already in the royal nursery , the new babies would come behind him with the elder becoming the spare while the younger would have no real role			2
as for which parent is responsible for the @entity1 royal twins - or the @entity234 ones , should they come to pass , consultant gynaecologist dr @entity276 says both could be behind a multiple birth , although the mother is the more likely candidate			1
‘ twins are not genetically based , ' he explains			0
' @entity285 twins are more rare and when a single fertilised egg divides in two , creating identical twins			0
‘ another way is when a mother release two eggs at ovulation and both are fertilised , creating non identical twins			0
‘ if either the mother or the father have twins in their family , the chances of them having twins is higher			0
’ a crown fit for two ? princess @entity0 and @entity18 announced on tuesday that they expecting twins - which has led many to speculate which baby will inherit the throne wedding bells : @entity0 , 36 , a former @entity308 swimmer from @entity309 , married @entity18 in july 2011 ' the truth is that , i 'm sorry to say , @entity18 has n’t seen @entity193 since a brief visit last september , ' she claimed			1
' it has become impossible since he married that girl			0
' in 2005 , @entity18 said in an interview with @entity316 that while @entity193 will never inherit the throne , ' he will be very well taken care of ' - presumably financially			0
while it 's rare for a noble figure to have twin heirs , it has happened before - most recently in 2009 , when @entity323 , the seventh @entity324 , welcomed twin boys with his wife @entity326 , a former fashion model 23 years his junior			2
born by c - section three months premature , the boys were named @entity330 and @entity332 @entity331			0
older by a few minutes , @entity238 is the heir - apparent to the @entity333 and bears the courtesy title @entity324			0
@entity332 is known as @entity324			0
succession : in 2002 , @entity336 changed @entity1 's constitutional laws to allow his daughters @entity147 ( left ) and @entity148 ( right ) and their children to inherit the throne should @entity18 fail to marry and produce an heir who will it belong to ? the @entity344 in @entity1 pictured during the wedding ceremony of @entity18 illegitimate : @entity18 has two children out of wedlock - one of whom is daughter @entity178			1
