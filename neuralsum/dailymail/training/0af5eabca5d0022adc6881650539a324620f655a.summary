by @entity0 more than a third of patients infected with a new strain of bird flu died after being admitted to the hospital earlier this year , @entity2 researchers report in a new study			0
since the new @entity11 bird flu first broke out in @entity2 in late march , the strain has infected more than 130 people and killed 37			2
the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) has previously described @entity11 as ' one of the most lethal influenza viruses ' it has ever seen and said it appeared to spread faster than the last bird flu strain , @entity17 , that threatened to unleash a pandemic			1
after making some adjustments for missing data , the @entity2 scientists estimated the overall death rate to be 36 per cent			1
precautions : an employee wearing a protection suit sprays disinfectant on chickens at a poultry market in @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity2 , last month the outbreak was stopped after @entity2 closed many of its live animal markets - scientists had assumed the virus was infecting people through exposure to live birds			0
that makes the new strain less deadly than @entity17 , which kills about 70 per cent of the people it infects			2
still , @entity11 is more lethal than the swine flu that caused a 2009 global epidemic			1
that had a death rate of less than one per cent			1
the results were released in two papers on the @entity11 strain , published online monday in the journal @entity50			0
one article compared the new @entity11 strain with the @entity17 strain , using data from confirmed cases of @entity11 ( 130 patients ) and @entity17 ( 43 patients ) that were reported until may 24 , this year			1
it found that both viruses were related to exposure to poultry - 75 per cent of patients infected with @entity11 and 71 % of those with @entity17			1
new strain : researchers found that the virus effectively mutated to resist treatment in three of 14 cases ( file picture ) though there was little evidence , save for a small cluster , to show that @entity11 transmitted from human to human			2
the new flu strain appears to infect older people more			0
researchers found the average age of infected patients was 62 years , compared with 26 for @entity17			2
men in urban areas appear to be more prone to infection than women			0
' the good news is that numbers of ( @entity11 ) cases have stalled , ' @entity83 and @entity84 of the @entity85 wrote in a commentary accompanying the article			0
however , they warned that the threat of the virus still ' persists ' and predicted that the strain might return in the winter , when flu viruses are typically most active			0
resistant : three @entity99 sufferers of a strain of bird flu which has killed 36 people in @entity2 have shown resistance to antiviral drugs such as @entity105 ( pictured ) that assessment echoes the @entity13 , which earlier this month also warned of the virus adapting and becoming resistant to therapy			1
@entity99 doctors treating 14 sufferers of the @entity11 virus recently found that it had become resistant to @entity105 in three of the patients			1
researchers at the @entity115 said that while the drug reduced levels of the virus in 11 of the patients , genetic testing of bird flu in the three who did not respond to treatment showed it was able to effectively mutate to resist @entity105 .			0

studies of 130 confirmed cases of @entity11 found one - in - three - death rate
compares with @entity17 death rate of around 70 per cent
death rate of 2009 swine flu epidemic was just one per cent
@entity134 has shown resistance to @entity105 in some sufferers
