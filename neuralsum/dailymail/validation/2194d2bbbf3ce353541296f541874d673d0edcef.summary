just for a second , @entity0 allowed himself to drift off into a brighter future before crashing back to the remorseless reality of @entity5 ’s present			1
‘ i look to the summer time and how we are going to build a team that is a @entity5 team , ’ the new manager began			1
‘ but that ’s for another day			0
the immediate concern is just to win some matches			0
’ @entity0 issues instructions from the touchline during his first game in charge of @entity5 @entity5 's @entity17 opens the scoring for the home side in just the fourth minute of the match for @entity0 , who arrived at the club last week , @entity5 is a club of heritage and romance			1
it is @entity26 ’s diving header crashing into the @entity28 net in 1987 , it is @entity29 leading the ‘ @entity30 ’ , it is of a team that was a staple of the top division for 34 years			0
he has vowed to take them back there , to their ‘ rightful place ’			0
the reality is very different			0
today , @entity29 ’s bronze statue stands outside a superstore for the rugby club @entity41 , whose amber and black logo looms over the main entrance			0
they own the place ; @entity5 are strangers in their own home , seeking to get out in the next few years			1
the @entity49 is magnificent , ready for the top flight			1
but few thought that would mean @entity54 rugby union rather than @entity54 football			0
confidence has drained , crowds are down			0
when the club returned from their exile in @entity60 35 miles away back in september , over 27,000 packed into the ground			0
on saturday , a mere 9,446 turned out			2
the potential for massive crowds is obvious but poor form has seen many return their scarves to the back of the wardrobe			2
the @entity5 wide man wheels away in celebration after giving his side the perfect start it ’s because @entity5 are staring at the indignity of fourth - tier football for the first time since 1959 and , after this chastening reintroduction to management after 16 months away , @entity0 is in no doubt as to how precarious their situation is			1
‘ if we ’d sat here and we ’d won , i ’d be telling you how great it was but as a football manager it really hurts , ’ he reflected			0
‘ the highs are really good , the lows low but there ’s not much in between			0
‘ it would have been nice to give the fans a victory			0
i do n’t think the players let them down but we are where we are			0
’ to be exact , still a sole point above the relegation zone after an afternoon that had started so positively for his team			2
the mere presence of the former @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity106 boss seemed to energise the place initially and @entity5 led on four minutes through captain @entity108			1
the former @entity106 and @entity104 manager holds his arms aloft in appeal at the @entity49 they were comfortable until two @entity114 goals just before the break turned the tables			1
@entity117 and then the impressive @entity118 , released by @entity0 ’s predecessor @entity119 in the summer , exposed defensive flaws			2
but @entity5 rallied and when @entity121 came off the bench to level , they had all the momentum with 20 minutes to play			2
alas , six minutes later , @entity127 ’s free - kick handed the three points to @entity114 , who are just two points off the play - offs			1
their manager , @entity131 , made 70 league appearances for @entity5 as a defender			2
he certainly does n’t want to see them slide into @entity136			0
‘ i think they have just brought in a fantastic manager , ’ he said			0
‘ i think he will keep them up and then build in the summer for next season			0
’ for @entity0 , though , it ’s only the here and now that matters			2
performance of the weekend @entity146 were about to go top of the @entity148 as goals from @entity150 and @entity151 put them 2 - 0 up against @entity152			1
but @entity154 ’s men staged a stunning stoppage - time comeback through a @entity157 penalty and @entity159 ’s leveller			1
@entity160 ( left ) gets first to the ball as he knocks the ball home from close range the former @entity166 striker ( right ) secured a last - gasp point for @entity152 at @entity146 on saturday what 's caught my eye @entity170 extended his championship tally to 22 goals but the striker was left to rue missing a sitter from four yards as @entity175 were held 1 - 1 by @entity166			1
@entity170 fires home to put @entity175 1 - 0 up against @entity166 early on in the match @entity178 ( right ) fires home brilliantly from close range for @entity180 against @entity106 @entity181 loanee @entity178 scored a cracker as @entity180 ’s resurgence under @entity184 continued with a 2 - 1 win over title - chasing @entity106			1
@entity188 ’s @entity187 have hit form at the perfect time			1
their 2 - 0 win at @entity192 was their sixth win in seven in the league , all coming with clean sheets .			1

@entity0 suffered defeat in his first game in charge of @entity5
the @entity5 lost 3 - 2 against @entity114 on saturday
despite that @entity0 is confident of a bright future at the @entity49
elsewhere , @entity152 produced a stunning comeback at @entity146 to earn themselves a point in a 2 - 2 draw
in - form @entity175 striker @entity170 missed a sitter in @entity166 draw
@entity187 are flying high in @entity210 - with six wins in seven games
