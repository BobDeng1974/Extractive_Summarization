@entity0 does not need reminding just how important this season is to his career			1
the @entity4 midfielder is painfully aware that , at the age of 22 , he must start to deliver on his enormous potential and put the injury - ravaged start to his career behind him			1
ahead of monday ’s @entity11 qualifier in @entity12 , @entity0 knows @entity14 boss @entity13 is looking to him with expectation after losing @entity16 and @entity17 , and is not impressed with what feels like a barrage of criticism from former internationals			1
he ’s got to take games by the scruff of the neck like two years ago — there ’s no excuses anymore			2
@entity43 — june 2014 with @entity16 and @entity17 coming to the end with @entity14 , @entity0 has an open goal to be our midfield general			1
@entity43 — september 2013 @entity0 looks like he is lacking confidence			1
maybe he has a lack of faith in his body after so many injuries in quick succession			2
it happens , i know			2
@entity43 — february 2013 @entity0 wore @entity57 ’s old no 8 shirt and showed signs he could be @entity14 ’s next midfield genius			1
@entity43 — october 2012 @entity0 , like all very good players , has an image in his head of where the next pass is going — that means he is a step ahead			1
it started last season with @entity30 and resurfaced after @entity4 ’s opening game of the season from @entity72 columnists @entity73 and @entity31 on @entity36			1
@entity73 claimed the brilliant form of @entity75 was @entity0 ’s ‘ biggest problem ’ but @entity31 said : ‘ i think you are being kind			1
@entity0 is @entity0 ’s biggest problem			1
‘ he is not performing			2
he has got to do better			2
he has to take games by the scruff of the neck			2
there are no excuses for this young man any more			2
it ’s nothing to do with smoking			2
i played with better players than him who smoked			0
he has got to do better on the pitch			0
’ last season , @entity30 said on television that @entity0 had not improved since he was 17			1
it prompted a call to @entity30 for an explanation , then @entity30 hit out again at @entity93 for going public about their conversation			0
‘ with @entity30 , we were n’t even playing , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i think it was a @entity98 game and he came at me			0
i spoke openly about it which , obviously , i should n’t have			0
‘ if anything , i think @entity31 should have a little bit more sympathy			1
he was injured just as much as i was			0
maybe more than i was			0
he was never injured at my age and it does take a lot of mental strength			0
so to hear people go on tv and say : “ he ’s got to be doing this or that ”			0
i do n’t need that			0
winner : @entity0 will be hoping to add to his trophy collection after winning the @entity117 last season eye on the ball : midfielder @entity0 started @entity14 's friendly against @entity119 on wednesday ‘ it disappoints me			1
it ’s easy to go on tv and say : “ he ’s got to do this or that ” or “ if he ’s not fit , he ’s not in the starting line - up and he ’s got to get fitter ”			0
that ’s the easy way out			0
i know that ’s part and parcel of football			0
but when it ’s just reckless and aggressive , i do n’t listen			0
’ @entity72 ’s @entity31 twice broke his ankle on @entity14 duty near the start of his career and later suffered a succession of knee problems , which led to 12 operations , restricted him to 17 caps and ended his career at the age of 31			1
he has criticised @entity142 , but he has also showered him with praise			0
@entity0 was 17 and hailed as the nation ’s great midfield hope when he was hit by a series of ankle injuries and tendinitis			1
it has taken time to get back to the same high levels and his lifestyle has also come under scrutiny			0
‘ i ’ve been caught a couple of times smoking , but i ’m not a regular smoker , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i spoke with @entity159 after the second time and it was : “ look , come on @entity0			2
this is a big season for you ”			0
when i came back to pre-season training i said i ’d be fit and ready to start and i have been			0

the @entity4 man has responded to recent criticism of his performances
@entity72 columnists @entity73 and @entity31 have both commented on @entity0 's recent form
@entity0 believes the criticism is *unjust* as he has had to *overcome* a number of injuries
