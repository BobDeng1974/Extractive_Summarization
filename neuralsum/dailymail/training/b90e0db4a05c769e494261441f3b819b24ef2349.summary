by @entity0 published : 14:41 est , 20 february 2014 @entity2 : 14:57 est , 20 february 2014 @entity4 's favourite dish , fish and chips , faces a sharp rise in price as the recent storms cause the wholesale price of fish to go up by more than 40 per cent			1
fishing vessels across the @entity4 's coasts have been unable to set sail because of the stormy weather , stopping supply and pushing up fish prices			1
because of this , the price of a portion of fish and chips has gone up 10 per cent , around 35 pence per portion			1
a person buying a simple portion of fish and chips can expect to pay 35 pence more due to recent storms wholesalers are being forced to pay 40 per cent more for haddock , plaice and whiting caught in the @entity32			1
other species of fish have been nearly impossible to catch , and as a result some fish markets have been left completely bare			0
the president of the @entity39 of @entity40 , @entity41 , said : ' the price of fish is always affected by the weather - when it goes up , consumers must expect to pay as much as 10 per cent more			1
' obviously not many people who do fish and chips actually use fresh fish any more but those who do will have probably had an increase of about £ 3 per kilo			1
the difficulty in catching fish in stormy weather has meant that fishmongers have had to pay more for the fish that they sell , thus making the fish we buy more expensive ' that would probably work out at about an extra 35p per portion of fish			2
' buyers have had about a 30 - 40 per cent price increase recently and some things have been virtually impossible to get hold of			2
' when i went to @entity68 fish market the other week they had absolutely no produce available for just the second time in ten years			0
' it should be back down again within the next couple of weeks , i guess it all depends on what happens next			0
' the price of popular white fish often used in the @entity4 staple , such as cod and haddock , have gone up dramatically over the last 12 months			1
the price of haddock has risen by 54 per cent to £ 1,474 a tonne , and plaice has risen 51 per cent to £ 1,246 a tonne			2
fishing boats have had to contend with treacherous conditions due to the abnormally stormy winter weather but now , because of bad weather , the popular @entity4 seaside meal could be under more jeopardy			1
fishmonger @entity89 said : ' usually fishing boats go out for five to seven days but they have only been able to get out for a day or two because of the bad weather down in @entity91 and @entity92			2
' prices can fluctuate by up to 35 per cent in just seven days but we try to even out the prices throughout the year so that we do n’t shock the customers			0
' the prices are starting to come down again now because there are more fish in the system			0
things will improve week on week			0
' fish are a bit like the stock market			0
it is the only product these days that is still auctioned			0
they sell for the price that buyers want to pay			0
' the government body @entity110 has reassured people that the brunt of the bad weather price rises will be taken on by the business owners until the price drops back down			0
in addition , while many prices have been on the rise , fish like bream and sea bass have remained fixed due to the @entity4 fish farming industry .			1
