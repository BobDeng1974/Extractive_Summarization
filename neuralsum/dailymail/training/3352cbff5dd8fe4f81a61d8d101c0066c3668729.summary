getting rid of bad smells in a bathroom can be a tricky business , with some opting to install a fan or use candles and sprays			1
but a new invention claims to be able to more quickly remove odours so that the toilet stays smelling clean and fresh			2
called @entity11 , this odour - eliminating toilet seat aims to eliminate unsavoury smells by pumping them outside			1
called @entity11 ( shown ) the device has a built - in fan to get rid of bad smells			1
when a person sits on it a sensor triggers a fan inside the bowl , which filters any unpleasant odours away first , you 'll need to remove your old toilet seat by undoing its screws			1
then , after removing your current seat and the screws that hold it on , simply place the @entity11 on your toilet			1
the seat is ready to go as soon as you plug it in the nearest outlet			2
the last part is running the hose to the outside			0
to do this , you need to drill a hole in the wall behind the toilet with a drill bit and widen it with a wood eater bit			2
then pass the @entity47 through the silver finish and stick it into the hole			0
you will need to repeat the same hole on the outside of the house to run the hose all the way to the outdoors			0
@entity11 was invented by @entity55 from @entity56 , @entity16 and is currently seeking £ 50,000 ( $ 80,000 ) of funding on @entity58			1
the detachable seat can be placed on top of existing toilets when the old seat is removed			1
when a person sits on it a sensor triggers a fan inside the bowl , which filters any unpleasant odours away			0
the odours are taken through a hose away from the toilet and outside the house			0
to power the fan the seat needs to be plugged into a wall socket			2
one issue for potential owners , though , might be that a ventilation hole needs to be drilled in the side of the house to feed the hose outside			0
for people with houses made of something stronger than wood , this may be somewhat of a problem			0
but the company claims their solution is the best way to avoid embarrassing smells lurking in bathrooms			0
‘ traditional ceiling odour - removal fans are an inefficient solution because they allow odours to permeate into the room before removing , ’ the company writes ‘ they also suck out heated and cooled air , causing you to lose money on your utilities			1
‘ air fresheners are just a mask for odours , and often make what you ’ve done in the restroom even more obvious			0
‘ @entity11 makes having people over ( even that special someone ) worry - free			2
’ the fan is triggered when a person sits down ( shown )			0
the odours are taken through a hose away from the toilet and outside the house			0
one issue for potential owners , though , might be that a ventilation hole needs to be drilled in the side of the house to feed the hose outside the detachable seat is easily installed in place of existing seats			1
they claim it gets rid of smells better than other fans , sprays or candles			1
this can make using the bathroom more pleasant for the next person to walk in			0
it is currently seeking funding on @entity58 to launch in march 2015			1
