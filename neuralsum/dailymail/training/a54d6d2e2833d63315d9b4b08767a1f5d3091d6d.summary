@entity0 takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of @entity5 fixtures , as well as intriguing statistics from up and down the country			0
@entity8 appears to drift through games but he 's actually working harder than you 'd think			1
he covered 5.2 miles in his 79 minutes against @entity11			0
that is equivalent to 5.8 miles across 90 minutes – which just happens to be the average distance covered by @entity15 in games against the top four last season			1
@entity8 may not be finding the net with the same regularity as @entity15 did at @entity20 , but he is running the same as the @entity21 did against the top four teams last season 2			1
geordie @entity25 's emergence has been a huge bonus for @entity27 this season - and the left back , who made his @entity30 debut in the summer , has now also proved he can play as a central defender			1
the 23 - year - old product of the club 's youth system performed brilliantly alongside @entity35 in the 2 - 0 win at @entity37 , keeping new @entity39 star @entity38 to just one shot on goal			1
his 13 clearances were more than the rest of @entity45 's defenders put together			1
geordie @entity25 's emergence has been a huge bonus for @entity27 this season 3			1
@entity48 's nasty injury at @entity49 gave @entity50 a chance to return to @entity5 action – and the former @entity54 midfielder seized the opportunity			1
the 26 - year - old , out for 11 months after cruciate ligament surgery , had played just eight minutes of @entity5 football so far			2
but after replacing @entity48 at @entity49 with just 13 minutes gone he performed like he 'd not been away			0
no @entity5 player all weekend hit more accurate passes in the attacking half than the 52 that @entity50 produced – just a shame none of them got turned into a goal in the 1 - 1 draw			2
after replacing @entity48 at @entity49 after just 13 minutes , @entity50 played like he 'd not been away 4			0
@entity67 's appearance as a second half sub to replace the injured @entity69 against @entity70 was his first action since getting injured in mid-september , and he made a compelling case to get back in @entity74 's starting line - up			1
he won tackles to break up @entity70 's play , and got on the ball enough to hit 23 accurate passes in his 45 minutes compared to just nine achieved by former @entity80 star @entity69 in the first half			2
he also covered more ground – 3.8 miles of running compared to @entity69 's 3.3			1
@entity67 put on a compelling case to return to @entity74 's starting line - up on saturday evening 5			1
@entity85 's elevation to the @entity39 squad is encouraging fellow @entity87 full back @entity88 to match his standards			1
@entity88 , on loan from @entity11 but likely to make his move to @entity93 's permanent in january , has made sure the attacking flair of @entity95 has n't been missed since his £ 30million move to @entity54			1
against @entity97 he played 73 passes compared to @entity85 's 68 , was accurate with 83.6 per cent of them against 77.9 , and also covered a fraction more ground at 6.9 miles versus 6.8			1
@entity88 is performing well , and could be the next @entity87 player called up to the @entity39 team 6			1
@entity104 said it was a tough decision to sell @entity107 winger @entity106 to @entity108 during the summer , describing the 29 - year - old as ' the sort of lad you 'd be glad if your daughter brought home			2
' @entity106 was clearly eager to make @entity104 regret the £ 3million transfer even more , playing a starring role as his new club recorded their first @entity5 win of the season			0
he ran 8.1 miles in the game – the most ground covered by any player in all the weekend 's @entity5 fixtures			0
@entity106 was clearly eager to make @entity104 regret the £ 3million transfer from @entity125 7			0
@entity127 's fans are warming to the progress being made by @entity129 who on thursday will celebrate a year in charge at the @entity132			0
the crowd of 22,930 who watched their 0 - 0 draw with @entity135 was the highest attendance since 23,679 saw them play @entity138 shortly after the @entity139 took over			0
@entity127 's average gates , which hit 28,428 in their last @entity5 campaign in 2008 - 09 , had fallen to 16,794 by last season			1
a crowd of 22,930 watched @entity127 's goalless top fo the table clash with @entity135 8			2
@entity146 is another championship manager who will shortly celebrate his first anniversary in charge – but things are less happy for the @entity151 boss			0
in the relegation zone after the 3 - 1 collapse at @entity138 , even if he wins his next two games at home to @entity127 and at @entity156 he will only have the same 22 points from 19 games for which @entity159 was sacked last year			0
@entity146 is another championship manager who will shortly celebrate his first anniversary in charge 9			0
experienced @entity162 has had an instant impact since taking over at @entity164 after they had slumped to 92nd place in the football pyramid			0
after losing his first match in charge he is unbeaten in four now – and scored his first victory by knocking in - form @entity171 out of the @entity172 despite playing the last half an hour with ten men			2
one of his key decisions was to restore @entity177 squad man @entity176 as first choice goalkeeper , and the 27 - year - old was in outstanding form on saturday			2
@entity162 has had an instant impact since at @entity164 after being bottom of the @entity183 10			0
after a week of doom and gloom in @entity188 for @entity20 , @entity70 , @entity189 and to a lesser extent @entity11 , at least one @entity185 side enjoyed a @entity192 triumph			0
@entity171 's women 's team – now run under the same umbrella management as current @entity194 leaders @entity195 – have got one foot in the quarter - finals after going to @entity199 and winning 1 - 0			2
a @entity201 own goal , and some brilliant work by @entity171 keeper @entity203 , gave them a lead to take into thursday 's second leg at @entity206 .			0

@entity8 may not be finding the net at the same rate as @entity15
but he is running the same as @entity15 against the top four teams last season
@entity25 's emergence has been a huge bonus for @entity45
@entity67 put on a compelling case to return to @entity74 's starting line - up
@entity88 is in good form , and is looking to emulate @entity85
