@entity1 ’s new £ 28million striker @entity0 was unable to inspire his country to victory in their first game at the @entity6 , as 10 - man @entity7 came from behind to draw with @entity9			1
alongside his new @entity1 team - mate @entity10 , @entity0 was practically anonymous for much of the game as the elephants were almost embarrassed by the minnows - although he did manage to provide a crucial assist for @entity15 to level the scores			2
@entity17 scored @entity9 ’s opener before half - time , capitalising on some woeful @entity20 defending , before @entity21 made his side ’s job all the more difficult by stupidly pushing @entity24 in the face to earn a red card			1
@entity9 's players celebrate after @entity17 put them 1 - 0 up against @entity7 in @entity28 @entity17 ( centre ) , who plays his football for @entity31 in @entity32 - on loan from @entity34 , celebrates his goal for guinea @entity9 's goalkeeper @entity37 ( centre ) saves a header from @entity1 man @entity0 @entity7 : @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity20 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 ( @entity45 65 ) , @entity46 , @entity47 , ( @entity48 65 ) , @entity10 ( @entity49 86 ) , @entity21 , @entity0 subs not used : @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 goal : @entity48 72 guinea : @entity17 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity58 , @entity17 ( @entity63 71 ) , @entity69 subs not used : @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity63 , @entity66 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity63 , @entity78 goal : @entity80 but despite the man advantage guinea were unable to hold on , @entity0 finally springing to life 20 minutes from time to control a lofted pass and lay it inside to @entity85 ’s @entity48 , who finished with aplomb			1
and the former @entity89 man could have scored a winner moments later , but his near - post flick from a @entity93 cross was blocked by a defender			0
the result was harsh on @entity9 , perhaps the tournament ’s least - fancied side , who were impressive right from the off			2
it is remarkable that they are in @entity9 at all - having been forced to play their ‘ home ’ qualifiers in @entity106 because of the @entity108 crisis , they somehow made it through			0
and in the first half they looked dangerous at times , wingers @entity69 and @entity58 causing the @entity7 full - backs problems			2
the @entity7 defence - which conceded 11 times in six qualification games , featured @entity42 and @entity117 , both making their competitive international debuts - looked decidedly nervous long before the errors that led to @entity17 ’s opener			1
the goal itself was a shocking display of defending for an international team			0
@entity41 allowed a @entity9 attack to gain momentum , watching @entity69 cruise past him to run at @entity20			0
@entity129 ( left ) is challenged by @entity9 's @entity66 , the player who was struck by @entity21 during the match @entity21 ( centre ) turns to slap @entity132 through the match in @entity134 on tuesday as the former @entity136 forward swings , he catches his opposition player , who then falls to the ground the referee brandishes a red card to @entity21 , who immediately falls to the ground in disbelief at the decision then , when the ball came into the box , @entity10 ’s defensive header was appalling , dropping the ball into the danger zone for @entity17 to smash home on the volley			1
the star - studded @entity7 side , with the likes of @entity153 stars @entity0 , @entity46 and both @entity154 making up the spine of the team - and former top flight wingers @entity21 and @entity47 flanking them - ought to have been more threatening , but could only show flashes of their potential			1
@entity21 was the most dangerous of the front four , going on several dangerous dribbles , one of which ended with a brilliant save from @entity37 in the @entity9 goal			2
leaving two defenders in his wake the @entity166 winger squared to @entity0 instead of going alone			0
@entity1 ’s new signing scuffed his shot straight back to the winger , who was denied only by a stunning stop from @entity17 , pushing the ball onto the underside of the bar			0
@entity7 fans travelled to the game however they could , with some of these men hanging off their vehicle an @entity7 fan watches on in costume from the stands on @entity182 where @entity7 faced @entity9 a @entity9 fan poses for a photo with a sign mapping his country ahead of the @entity6 match it was the closest the elephants would come to a goal in a slow half where they lacked any sort of attacking momentum			1
and it was not until after @entity21 ’s moment of madness that the @entity198 managed to muster any sort of purposeful attacking threat			0
if @entity0 and @entity10 are to inspire either @entity7 or @entity1 to titles this year , they will have to play much better than this .			0

the @entity205 got underway in @entity134 on tuesday
@entity9 took a shock lead through @entity17 in the first half
@entity21 was sent off for slapping an opponent after the break
@entity15 *rescued* a point for @entity7 off the bench
