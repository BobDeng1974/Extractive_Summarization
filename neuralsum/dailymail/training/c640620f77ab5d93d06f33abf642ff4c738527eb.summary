@entity138 said she was unfamiliar with the cava - poo - chon , though she applauded the use of a geneticist			1
but she condemned ' gimmicks ' that some breeders and groomers use to attract unwitting buyers			2
' there is no such thing as a teacup anything , ' @entity138 said			0
' it is a market term used by backyard breeders and commercial breeders so they can breed the smallest dogs that should n't be bred and sell them for a whole lot of money			1
