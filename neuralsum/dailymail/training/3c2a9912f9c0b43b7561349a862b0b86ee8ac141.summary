after storming his home , officers found ' a vast number of documents in relation to jihad ' , mr @entity0 said			2
' he was not a mastermind he was more of a muscle type of role , ' he added			1
it was one of many early morning swoops across @entity77 and @entity78 , that involved 400 police and 23 search warrants , following an 18 - month anti-terrorism operation code - named @entity81			1

up to 17 people were arrested , including nine suspects in @entity23 and eight people in @entity6 – one of whom was @entity3 - during the november raids			1

the couple now have five children , who are all believed to be living in the @entity129 after @entity102 fled @entity6			2

she claimed they wanted to bring up their children safely			0
mr @entity0 doubts @entity3 ’s schizophrenic claims are legitimate			1
' i ’m no medical doctor but in addition to terrorism , he was also arrested for minor motor offences			0
he could have said he was schizophrenic to get off … he was certainly aware of what he needed to do manipulate the system			0
’ this is the house where @entity3 lived with his wife @entity92 and children before he was jailed in 2005 ‘ he 's not intelligent … you ’ve got to accept he ’s been classed as schizophrenic but he seemed to function in normal life until he was arrested , ’ mr @entity0 explained			1
indeed , just last week @entity3 claimed he put on his schizophrenic symptoms to fool the criminal justice system			2
‘ i played the government like ignorant children , ’ he said from @entity12 , the @entity11 reports			0
‘ i was never mentally ill , not then , nor now			0
’ mr @entity0 said the house that @entity3 lived in with his wife and children was just like any other western @entity6 home			1
‘ i think it was a three bedroom , one bathroom , style of residence and perhaps housing commission , ’ he said			0
@entity3 is now believed to be fighting with the islamic state organisation in @entity12 alongside fellow @entity6 man @entity142 mr @entity0 believes instead of focusing on @entity3 's actions in @entity12 we should be concerned about how he became indoctrinated in @entity11 mr @entity0 believes instead of focusing on @entity3 ’s actions in @entity12 we should be concerned about how he became indoctrinated in @entity11			1
' some of the things we miss at the moment while he 's over there is he was bred here , so how and why did he become so indoctrinated into such hate ? ‘ he was indoctrinated , groomed and trained in this country ... people have got to realise that			0
’ mr @entity0 , who began counter-terrorism work in 2003 but left the @entity78 police division in 2011 to start up his own private investigations firm with his father @entity201 , a former @entity78 commissioner of police , also believes revoking suspects ’ passports is not the answer to preventing terrorism			2
@entity3 met his blonde @entity11 wife @entity102 at @entity120 , before he was reportedly expelled in year nine ‘ it might stop them from going overseas and fighting but they can still plot attacks from @entity11 , ’ he said			2
the 40 - year - old explained fighting terrorism is not just an issue for the police , @entity85 or the @entity122 community			0
‘ they ca n’t do it on their own , ’ he said			0
he said since he start working in counter-terrorism the work has increased ‘ tenfold and it ’s still increasing today ’			0
‘ it ’s not something that 's going to go away			0
@entity223 's beliefs do n't go away			0
