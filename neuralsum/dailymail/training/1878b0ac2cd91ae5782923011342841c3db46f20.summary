by @entity0 the view from @entity2 and @entity4 ’s bedroom window is , frankly , rather astonishing			1
palm trees as high as houses sway in the breeze , 15ft banana trees stand firm , @entity6 windmill palms droop with huge clusters of green and purple seeds			1
there are enormous spiky agave plants , money trees the size of small bears , a 5ft bird of paradise			1
you can hear water tinkling in the distance			2
all that ’s missing is a troop of screaming monkeys swinging from liana to liana and a venomous snake or two			2
vast ferns rustle in the shade - is that a tiger breaking cover ? no , of course not			1
do n’t be so silly			2
because @entity2 , 56 , and @entity4 , 60 , do n’t actually live anywhere near the @entity46 rainforest , deep in the @entity47 or even in a particularly tropical spot of the @entity49			1
home is a modern detached house in the sprawling commuter village of @entity53 , on the outskirts of @entity27 , 50 yards from a thundering bypass			1
neighbouring gardens boast neatly clipped lawns , conservatories , rose beds and nylon washing lines			2
but @entity2 , who runs his own software company , prefers things a bit more tropical			1
‘ i do n’t know why			2
it ’s a good question			2
i ’ve never lived in the tropics			2
i ’ve never lived abroad			0
i was n’t even particularly interested in gardening when i was growing up , ’ he says			0
ready for action : @entity2 poses above with a pair of garden shears			1
he spends hours every day tending to his array of plants , which hail from all over the world could you guess ? from the front @entity22 's home in @entity53 , not far from @entity27 and yards from a thundering bypass - looks like any other home ‘ but 20 or 30 years ago we ’d go on summer holidays and i ’d spend all my time looking at jelly palms and @entity81 palms and think : “ wow ! i ’d love one of those in my garden			1
one day ... ” ’ the @entity22 family moved in when son @entity86 , now 25 , was still a baby , @entity87 , now 21 , was n’t even a glint in the eye and the garden was , well , just as you ’d expect a suburban garden to be			1
nice big patio , beech hedge , leylandii , apple trees , decent stretch of grass , a bright orange @entity99 fence , ornamental pagoda and not a banana tree or shrieking chimpanzee in sight			1
‘ it was fine for a bit			0
but no one else in the family is into gardening , so i just sort of started doing my own thing			0
i did n’t ask permission , ’ says @entity104 he is a self - taught amateur gardener			1
but , bit by bit , with the help of gardening books , information from the internet and trial and error , he transformed this quarter of an acre into looking like a painting by @entity122			0
@entity123 came the beech hedge and the apple trees and the pagoda			1
the leylandii were ripped up and replaced with a bamboo plantation			0
in went jelly palms from @entity130 , banana trees , ferns , ornamental cacti , yuccas , succulents , gunneras ( which looks a bit like monster prehistoric spiky rhubarb ) and rice paper plants			1
‘ i had a few tropical plants in our last garden , but they were all in pots and just waiting to be let loose			1
’ once unleashed , they must have gone mad			0
because today everything is massive , enormous , jungle - sized			1
the banana leaves are like sails			1
the foliage of the gunnera measures six foot across			0
the rice paper plant leaves are the size of coffee tables			0
hours ' work : @entity2 spends more than two hours every day watering his garden during dry spells - and has luckily never been hit by a hose - pipe ban despite his modesty , maintaining a jungle garden on the outskirts of @entity27 is n’t simply a combination of gentle pruning and swinging like @entity161 through the foliage			1
‘ it ’d be easier in @entity164 or down in the @entity165 - we ’re in a frost pocket here			1
’ so during winter , @entity2 spends hours hunched over his own weather station checking for cold snaps and high winds , erecting vast home - made polytunnels made of curved drainpipes and polythene over his prized agaves ( from sunny @entity176 ) and lovingly wrapping his tender palms and bananas in horticultural fleece			1
‘ i get very twitchy when it ’s cold			0
i ’ll be out there at three in the morning in my dressing gown , putting extra layers of fleece on			0
’ he also spreads ten bales of straw round the bases of the banana plants , builds plant shelters and decants the pot plants into a purpose - built greenhouse			1
this sounds a breeze , until you remember that many are 10ft and weigh half - a - ton each			1
‘ it takes three days with the help of @entity86 to get them all in			1
they hate the cold , so i have a fan heater going to keep the temperature above three or four degrees			0
’ humble roots : mr @entity22 's gardening ambitions began with a few humble palm trees , but became more audacious over time then , come spring , he has to reverse the whole process , hoping and praying no lasting damage has been done			1
‘ it ’s only in the spring you can tell if the palm trees are ok			2
they ’re still green , but the central spear will go mushy and collapse			0
‘ i have vision of how it should all look and then i end up with a blank spot in the garden			0
i ’m very critical and i want everything to be perfect			0
’ does @entity4 get irritated , what with him buzzing in and out all night in his pyjamas , fussing over the palms ? ‘ yes			2
i tend to get a bit engrossed and everything i do in the garden takes twice as long as i tell her it will			2
‘ but i think she minds more in the summer , when we could be going out for the evening and i ’m busy watering			1
’ and watering , and watering			2
during a dry spell , he ’ll spend at least two hours a night watering			1
‘ you could put a hose - pipe on a banana all day and they ’d lap it up			1
they could live in water			0
’ @entity240 : @entity2 admits to spending hours more than planed in his garden - and has reached the point where it is so full there is no extra room unless something dies happily , the @entity249 ’ house was built in 1988 , just before water meters were introduced			1
but what about hose - pipe bans ? ‘ we ’ve never had a hose - pipe ban here , only a sprinkler ban			2
but i ’ve got a well and a pump for emergencies			0
’ over the years , there have been disasters - ‘ i ’ve had terrible losses with my tender palms ’ - and triumphs			1
‘ it ’s a very big moment when one of the banana trees produces a banana - you ca n’t eat them , of course			1
they ’re small and there ’s no flesh in them			0
but the flower ! ah , it ’s a triffid - like flower			2
’ @entity2 ’s garden has won endless prizes , been featured in magazines and @entity279 ’s @entity278 and is open to the public every year as part of the @entity282 ( the next open day is sunday , september 14 )			1
and today , finally , after 25 years of hard work , it is finished			1
‘ it ’s done , it ’s full			0
to be honest , it ’s a bit of a relief			0
i ca n’t fit anything else in , so it ’s a one - in - one - out system when something dies			2
’ and , rude question , but what about the cost of it all ? extensive : much of the garden , pictured in the height of summer , is packed away in colder months exotic : the puya plant , pictured , originally comes from the mountainous @entity300 , but can survive in @entity27 vibrant : mr @entity303 's plants , such as this golden bamboo , are usually found thousands of miles away ‘ people always go on and on about the money , but i do n’t think it ’s that much - £ 10,000 altogether			1
you could spend that on a golf club subscription			0
it ’s a hobby and it ’s exercise , so it ’s good value for money			0
and all my family get to enjoy it , too			0
we even had the sitting room windows made bigger so we could all see it better			0
’ but what if they ever move ? ‘ i ’ll have to leave the plants behind			2
maybe i ’d donate some to @entity324 for their hot house			0
’ the garden would not appeal to everyone			0
today there ’s just teeny scrap of lawn left			0
barely space for a washing line			0
the tropical plants dominates totally and utterly			2
the views from the house are extraordinary			0
sit on their sofa and it really feels as if you ’re in a jungle			2
the only thing missing is colour			0
‘ there ’s loads of colour ! it ’s all colour ! ’ he says , outraged			0
but it ’s all green			0
what about flowers ? a rose or two or clematis ? @entity2 shudders			1
‘ i see no attraction in roses or clematis			0
they get diseases , they need lots of attention and everyone else is growing them			0
what ’s the point ? ’ and what about the neighbours ? ‘ they do n’t seem to be that into gardening			0
but i have noticed the odd bamboo springing up			0
‘ maybe it ’ll catch on and in 30 years this whole area will be one big jungle			1

@entity22 , a software *developer* from @entity53 , near @entity27 , has been working on his lush paradise for 25 years
behind regular - looking suburban home is a *veritable* jungle of palms , ferns and exotic plants from around the world
maintaining the dense network of shrubs , trees and plants is a *labour* of love which takes hours each day
whether *guarding* against deadly frosts in winter or endlessly watering in summer , @entity2 is always tending the plants
he estimates the entire project - which has won stacks of awards - has cost as much as £ 10,000 over the years
well - travelled plants can still thrive in @entity402 weather - and @entity2 has even grown banana fruit ( though it 's not edible )
