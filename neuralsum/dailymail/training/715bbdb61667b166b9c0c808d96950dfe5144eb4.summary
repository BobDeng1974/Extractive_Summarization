it was handwritten by @entity24 and each chapter details how to create different types of fireworks each chapter details how to create different types of fireworks , including the @entity30 and @entity31 , and @entity32 and @entity33			1
for example , the @entity36 is made of beech wood using two , 2oz ( 56g ) cases made from clay , joined together with 12 spokes ; six on the top and six on the bottom			0

iron filings were also added to the cases , which had to be ‘ very clean and bright			0
’ the book also advises sifting the powders through a hair sieve			1
each chapter details how to create different types of fireworks , including the @entity30 and vertical wheels ( pictured ) and @entity32 and @entity33 rockets			1

’ one @entity62 in the book has even been designed to celebrate the marriage of @entity64 and the teenage @entity65 of @entity66 in 1761 , and features a tin crown on top of the structure			1
@entity24 also reveals the best way to create @entity82 and states that although military moulds are made of brass , wooden moulds ‘ answer very well			1
’ paper and powder are then rolled and placed inside circular tubes to form the finished rocket			0
@entity24 also advises against cutting shapes on a table , so not to ‘ spoil ’ the surfaces			1
fireworks can be traced back to ancient @entity94 , around the time of the @entity96 between 206 and 220 bc. during that period , it was discovered that when rods of bamboo were lit on fire , they began to crackle and eventually exploded			2
