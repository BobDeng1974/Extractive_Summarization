a woman has participated in a nude photo shoot after getting out of an unfaithful , tumultuous marriage , conquering a debilitating illness , and losing a hundred pounds			2
@entity4 , 29 , of @entity5 , @entity6 , allowed photographer @entity7 to shoot her as part of journalist @entity10 's @entity9 : healing @entity12 series			1
she also received life - coach services from @entity15 as part of the project			0
ms @entity4 credits her miraculous weight loss to a ' return to emotional health ' she experienced after moving to @entity6 to ' be closer to nature ' following her divorce			1
she attributes the loss to her ' return to emotional health ' not ashamed ! ms @entity4 said she decided to pose nude ' to show myself that my physical body did n't have to be an obstacle to me living a life i love ' for years , ms @entity4 was ravaged by the effects of @entity34 ( or ' hs ' ) , a non-contagious illness that causes size - able , painful lumps to form under the skin			1
the lumps frequently result in lesions and scarring , making her decision to bare it all that much more significant			2
her hs is worsened by stress - and was exacerbated during her year and a half long marriage to her ex-husband , who occasionally would n't want to touch her because of her illness			2
' hs people who are n't already in relationships find it difficult to begin new relationships because of what other people will think , ' she said			2
she found out he was cheating on her - and when she went to file divorce papers , she discovered he had filed separation papers a year earlier			2
' i could either drink and whore myself out for the rest of my life or i could get up , get angry , cry and figure out why this happened , ' she said			0
she opted for the latter and moved to @entity6 , to ' be closer to nature			1
' proud ! since her early twenties , ms @entity4 has suffered from @entity34 - a disease that caused the scars visible under her arms and on her breasts grin and bare it ! the subject was nervous at first for her shoot , but felt at ease after the first few shots nesting ! ms @entity4 was n't embarrassed about her scars being visible in the shots and said ' you can either fight it or welcome it			1
either way , it is there ' in @entity6 , as she healed , she miraculously lost a hundred pounds - without altering her diet or exercise routines			1
at the same time , her @entity34 flare - ups decreased to the point of almost disappearing entirely			2
' healthy / balanced feeding of my physical body as well as my mental , emotional and spiritual self is the key for my whole - body health and my relationship with @entity34 , ' she told @entity90			1
now , years later , ms @entity4 is happy with her life - and considers her decision to pose for nude photographs an expression of her ' blossoming			1
' video courtesy of @entity4 - @entity4 before the transformation ! an old photo of ms @entity4 , when she is ' at her heaviest ' taking a deep breath ! ms @entity4 loved ' being naked outdoors ' and said she ' felt honored to share my body with the elements in such a natural way ' although she was nervous at first during the shoot , ms @entity7 quickly put her at ease			1
' i loved being naked outdoors			0
it was such a beautiful sunny day - and yes i was so sunburnt afterwards , ' she said			0
' i have a deep connection with land , animals , trees and water so i felt honored to share my body with the elements in such a natural way			0
' after the pair had taken a few pictures , ms @entity4 began suggesting different shots and ' asking to lay in the flowers or stand in the creek			1
' her scars were but a passing thought - and she was n't worried about them being visible in the photos			0
' i have lived with those scars for many years now that i do n't remember any different , ' she said			0
' when your body changes you can either fight it or welcome it			0
either way , it wo n't change the fact that it is there			0
' inner peace ! now that ms @entity4 has ' returned to emotional health ' her hs flare - ups are few and far between a transformative experience ! ' there is much more to us than just this body , ' ms @entity4 said			1
' when we all realize this , we can begin to get to the real depth in our lives and connections			0
' now that the photos are published for the world to see , ms @entity4 does n't regret taking part in the project - and has learned a lot about herself from the experience			1
' the main reason i chose to participate in the project was to show myself that my physical body did n't have to be an obstacle to me living a life i love , ' ms @entity4 said			1
' so many people , men and women , are afraid of their bodies			0
they put living on hold because of their fears and @entity166 more people would do what they want to do , what inspires and heals them , we would all see a world much different than the one we see now			0
' ' there is much more to us than just this body			0
when we all realize this , we can begin to get to the real depth in our lives and connections , and move on from the surface			0
