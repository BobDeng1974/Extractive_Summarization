@entity218 and @entity219 leaving the @entity8 , @entity8 , @entity29 , earlier this week the court heard @entity17 probably died as a result of ' suffocation or chest compression '			1
and , it was alleged that after murdering @entity17 , @entity30 took a photograph of the 12 - year - old ’s naked body			1
experts were unable to give a definite cause of death as the 12 - year - old ’s body was so badly decomposed			0
but pathologist dr @entity233 said : ' considering the negative findings and taking this case as a whole as it has been presented to me , it seems a form of suffocation or chest compression would appear to be the most likely cause of death			1
' it is one i can not make for sure because of the condition of the body			0
' the @entity8 heard @entity17 was dressed in a pink and white @entity247 pyjama set when her body was found a week after she went missing last august			1
sobs could be heard from the public gallery as a picture of the 12 - year - old 's body flashed up on video screens in the courtroom and some family members had to leave			2
dr @entity233 told jurors he was unable to find any evidence a brutal attack had taken place but he said : ' it can not be completely excluded			0

he added : ' she was dressed at the time in white and pink pyjama bottoms and a vest which had @entity247 on			0
' mr @entity233 said there were no injuries on her body to suggest she died as a result of a fall , as @entity30 claims			1
she had no broken bones , obvious bruising or bleeding , he said			0
the court heard the doctor ‘ did not find any positive pathological sign of injury			2
’ but he said if @entity17 had been suffocated subtle signs of compression to the chest , neck or face could have disappeared post-mortem			1
@entity17 's father @entity148 ( centre ) and his partner @entity149 ( right ) arrive at the @entity8 today jurors heard there were traces of amphetamine in @entity17 ’s body but the pathologist was certain this was due to natural processes after death and not that she had been drugged			1
the court was again shown a sickening image of a girl believed to be @entity17 lying naked on a bed , which was recovered on a memory stick allegedly belonging to @entity30			1
mr @entity233 said : ' when i saw this photo there were changes in the body that suggest to me that the individual is dead			0
' there is certainly the possibility that this picture is @entity7			1
