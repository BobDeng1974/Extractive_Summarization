@entity0 believes a lack of winter break is hampering @entity4 clubs in @entity6 competition			1
@entity7 were eliminated from the round of 32 in the @entity9 by @entity10 on away goals on wednesday night - whilst @entity12 and @entity13 both need to turn around first - leg defeats to @entity16 and @entity17 , respectively if they are to advance			1
@entity18 and @entity19 have been knocked out of the @entity20 with only @entity21 still standing and @entity0 feels a heavy festive schedule always catches @entity24 clubs out			1
@entity25 boss @entity0 says @entity4 clubs are suffering in @entity26 because of no winter break @entity7 were dumped out of the @entity9 on wednesday night by @entity10 @entity29 's ( right ) extra-time header meant the @entity31 giants went through 3 - 3 on away goals ' i think , like i have before , that we do n't help ourselves with our fixture list , ' the @entity25 boss said			1
' playing as many games as we do through @entity38 and @entity39 and not having the opportunity to shut the league down for a few weeks gives every club that plays in @entity26 a disadvantage			0
' when they come back to playing in @entity26 they may have a considerable amount of injures in certain areas and mental fatigue kicks in on players - that is bound to have an effect when other teams have had the opportunity to take a break			0
' @entity57 boss @entity56 hailed the entertainment level of the @entity4 but believes @entity24 clubs still lack the tactical nous of their continental counterparts			2
@entity21 are the only @entity4 club still standing in the @entity20 @entity57 boss @entity56 says @entity4 clubs should be doing better in @entity26 ' i 've always said the @entity4 is the best league in the world but more so for entertainment rather than technical and tactical situations in countries like @entity68 , ' he said			1
' the @entity4 is the best league in that it is the most entertaining , highest tempo , most ferocious and so much happens			2
' whether we need to improve on the tactical i 'm not sure but we 've got some of the best managers in the world in this league			0
' it is very fine margins at that level as games are won and lost by one or two moments in a game			0
' looking at those players in those @entity4 teams you think they would do better in those competitions			0
so i 'm not sure if it 's one of those seasons or if there is a fundamental problem			0
