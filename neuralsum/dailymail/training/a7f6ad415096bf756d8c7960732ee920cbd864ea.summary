by @entity0 published : 13:43 est , 14 february 2013 @entity2 : 16:56 est , 16 february 2013 the house of the future could be built from plastic and look like a spider 's web , if one group of conceptual architects have their way			2
@entity12 - based architecture collective @entity13 have created this concept for the first @entity15 printed house , and say the first prototype could be built by this summer			1
they are the latest entrants to a race to construct the first @entity15 printed home , which could revolutionise house building and even potentially solve the @entity23 's housing crisis			1
the group , who are the latest to join the race to create the first 3d - printable home , say the first prototype could be built as soon as this summer ' it would take up to three weeks to have all the pieces fabricated , ' said @entity34 , a member of the collective , to @entity36			1
' assembly on site is a one - day job , if the site is prepared before hand			2
' he told the site that the house would stick together with velcro or button - like fasteners , dispensing with the need for traditional building techniques			1
the proposal is a development of an earlier prototype printed house which was unveiled last october at the @entity53 in @entity12 , which , instead of solid walls , featured a fibrous nylon structure based on bones			2
protohouse 2.0 , as it is known , takes the same minimalist approach , using just enough plastic material to maintain structural integrity			0
like a spider 's web : the proposal is a development of an earlier prototype printed house which was unveiled last october at the @entity53 in @entity12 , which , instead of solid walls , featured a fibrous nylon structure based on bone components will be manufactured off - site at existing 3d printing plants in laser - sintered bioplastic , which mr @entity34 said is will give better quality than printing on site with sand or concrete , as others have suggested			1
he told @entity79 : ' these highly fibrous structures are only 0.7 millimetres thick			0
' it 's impossible to print those with stone , because there 's not enough structure or strength or integrity in sand			0
in the factory environment you can go into stronger materials like plastics or metals			0
' components would be built off site and the house would stick together with velcro or button - like fasteners , dispensing with the need for traditional building techniques the cost of building the house has not been revealed , but mr @entity34 said the improved economies of scale offered by the burgeoning 3d printing industry means such homes could be economically competitive in the ' near future '			1
mr @entity34 dismissed a rival @entity15 printed house project announced by @entity109 studio @entity108 , since the proposal was only to print the formwork then complete the structure in concrete			0
' so it 's not that the actual building is @entity15 printed , ' he said .			0

they are the latest entrants to the race to put together the first 3d - printable home
components would be manufactured off - site then stuck together like velcro
