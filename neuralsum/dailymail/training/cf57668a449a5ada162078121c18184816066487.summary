when he was found crammed into a chicken coup , his rescuers feared for the worst			2
but three months after @entity5 the orangutan was taken to safety in @entity7 , the little ape has finally left intensive care - and is almost able to stand by himself			1
his heartbreaking plight and subsequent recovery has earned him fans around the world			2
and from being so ill that he cried in pain if he was touched , he is now beginning to take his first steps - albeit with some assistance			1
with the help of vets and other volunteers with charity @entity20 ( @entity20 ) , @entity5 is seen beginning to walk , his species ' distinctive long arms being the key to getting moving			1
@entity48 , the chief executive of @entity20 , said : ' it ’s hard to believe this healthy young infant is the same poor creature we found lying on his back in a cage , completely unable to move or sit up			1
' when @entity5 was rescued he was so weak and fragile that we all feared he would n’t survive			2
but he has proved to be a real fighter and is now safely on the road to recovery			1
' he still has a long way to go but his pain has subsided , the swelling in his body and limbs has disappeared , he has a healthy appetite and is becoming more energetic and active by the day			2
' @entity5 is just one of the many orangutans exposed to appalling conditions in @entity67 , where their natural habitats are increasingly under threat			1
many are orphaned during logging operations and the orphans kept as pets , with the people supposed to be looking after them entirely unaware of their needs			0
open wide : @entity5 had been unable to even open and close his mouth but is now feeding well at the sanctuary in @entity67 which has rescued him and which depends on donations to help him and other animals in training : eventually vets will be able to see if @entity5 can swing through the trees like his relatives in the wild sleeping well : at first @entity5 would scream in pain if touched but is now settling into a more normal life in @entity5 's case he was given just condensed milk , which meant that when the charity was contacted by his owner , he did not know how to chew , and his limbs - thanks to his poor diet - were misshapen , weak and swollen			1
his owner , who lives in @entity94 , in the @entity96 area of @entity67 , had admitted he was ill when she asked for help from the charity			1
since his rescue @entity5 has learned how to eat properly , as he has gained the muscle strength to open and close his mouth , and been given physiotherapy to overcome the problems in his legs and arms			2
although he is yet to return to the trees where his species should live , the charity is hopeful of more progress			2
at just over a year , @entity5 is still a baby , and a normal orangutan will not climb trees unassisted until they are around two , when they move in the branches by holding hands with other orangutans			0
in the wild the apes will be weaned around the age of four , and a year later begin to spend time away from their mothers			0
the typical orangutan lifespan in captivity or the wild is around 30 years , and 45 years is towards the top of expectations			0
the oldest recorded lifespan was @entity128 , who died aged 59 at the @entity129 , @entity130 , in 1977 , the @entity126 reported			0
@entity5 's recovery will take many years and it is still too early to tell if he will be able to survive in the wild , his rescuers say			0
the charity estimates it will cost about £ 5,000 a year to care for the little orangutan and he is likely to need six or seven years of rehabilitation before he can even be considered for release into the wild			1
if @entity5 does not regain the strength he will need to fend for himself in the forest , @entity20 will have to cover the cost of caring for him in their sanctuary for the rest of his life			0
it has already received tens of thousands of dollars in donations for @entity5 and other animals ' plight , but says more are welcome			0
@entity20 , the @entity152 charity based in @entity153 , @entity150 saves animals , big and small , from suffering around the world			1
work includes freeing and caring for dancing bears in @entity158 , rescuing primates from captivity in @entity7 , and sterilising and vaccinating stray dogs and cats in developing countries			0
wherever possible , the charity returns rescued animals to their natural environment but it also provides a permanent home for those that can no longer survive in the wild			1
@entity20 works to educate the public in the compassionate and humane treatment of all animals			0
sound scientiﬁc evidence forms the basis of its decision - making and determines the course of its rescue operations			0
it also works with other like - minded organisations and government departments to strengthen legislation to protect animals from cruelty and neglect .			0
