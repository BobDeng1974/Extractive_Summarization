on day two of the election campaign , the @entity0 were boosted by a string of economic indicators – crowned by @entity18 figures showing @entity3 is enjoying its strongest growth since 2006			1
the @entity3 is out - performing all other leading economies , including the @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24			1
in seven signs that the economy is on the up following the worst slump since the 1930s : @entity29 has repeatedly claimed that families are £ 1,600 a year worse off than they were when the @entity11 came to power , but shadow chief secretary to the treasury @entity32 last night conceded that living standards appeared to be ‘ crawling back to the levels that we were at five years ago ’			1
as @entity38 claimed the @entity37 would help business to create two million more jobs over the next five years if they remained in power , on top of 1.9 million since 2010 , independent economists said the government could boast a ‘ remarkable ’ record on employment			2
car giant @entity47 announced a £ 200million investment in its @entity50 plant - one of the many signs the economy is on the up chancellor @entity5 hailed ‘ a hat - trick of good news about the @entity3 economy ’ , insisting : ‘ with 37 days to go until the election , it ’s another sign that changing course would put recovery at risk			1
voters now face a stark choice : do we stick with a plan which is working , delivering growth and jobs , or do we put all that at risk with @entity66 whose policies of more spending , more borrowing and higher taxes will lead to economic chaos ? ’ @entity29 had planned to use @entity76 ’s famous question – ‘ are you better off than you were four years ago ’ – as a central plank of its election campaign , but the pressure on family finances has eased in recent months as the cost of food and fuel tumbles and wages rise			1
inflation has fallen to zero – its lowest level for more than half a century – and @entity3 looks set for a period of deflation or falling prices			1
overall , it means the average @entity3 voter now has more cash to spend than they did at the 2010 election			2

and exports rose by 4.6 per cent in the final three months of 2014 despite the ongoing crisis in the @entity114			1
@entity115 chief secretary to the treasury @entity116 said : ‘ rescuing our economy was the main reason that the @entity115 formed the @entity11			2

’ shadow chancellor @entity124 said the recovery had been the slowest in 100 years			0
‘ a small upward revision today in the gdp figures does n’t change that overall record			0
this has been a disappointing recovery and it did n’t have to be this way , ’ he said			0
experts said @entity3 was on course for another strong year in 2015			1
@entity132 , of @entity133 , said : ‘ we should expect gdp forecasts for this year to be revised upwards on the back of this data			2
it is still entirely possible that the @entity3 will head the @entity139 growth league in 2015 , as we did last year			1
’ however , in a setback for the government , the services sector , which powers much of the economy , has slipped back			0
output from services firms – which make up about 78 per cent of gdp and range from hotels to hairdressers – fell 0.2 per cent in january			2

here , we examine the key facts to emerge on what could be a pivotal day in the battle for no 10 ... @entity66 and his shadow ministers have peddled myths over the past five years and on @entity161 of the election campaign they exploded @entity169 : ‘ this has been a disappointing recovery and it did n’t have to be this way			0

@entity22 , the next highest , grew at a rate of 2.5 per cent			0
@entity169 : ‘ living standards have fallen			1

disposable income – a calculation of incomings versus outgoings – now stands at £ 4,187 compared to £ 4,178 in the second quarter of 2010			2
the independent @entity190 predicts families will be £ 900 better off by the end of 2015			2
@entity29 ’s £ 1,600 figure excludes tax changes and dates from april 2014 : since then inflation has fallen sharply while pay rises have improved			1
@entity169 : ‘ it is a complete fantasy the private sector could mop up the jobs lost during cuts to the private sector			0
’ reality : the @entity203 yesterday said ‘ the economy has done incredibly well in terms of job creation ’			0
employment is up by 1.9million since the election with an average of 1,000 jobs being created every day			0
for every one job lost in the public sector , four have been created in the private sector			0
unemployment is down 654,000 since 2010 to 1.86million			0
@entity216 : ‘ consumers lack confidence			0
they are not feeling the recovery in a tangible way			0
’ the number of people working full - time has risen by 1.42million - 75 % of the rise in employment since the election has been in full - time jobs reality : the internationally - respected @entity228 measure – a large - scale survey of the public ’s personal finances , savings and optimism about the future – rose to +4 in march , its highest level since june 2002			1
over the past year it has risen by nine points			2
this compares to a record low of -39 during the @entity29 years , recorded at the height of the financial crisis in july 2008			0
real household spending after inflation rose by 0.3 per cent in the year to december 2014			2
it has risen by 3 per cent since the @entity11 came to power			2
@entity169 : ‘ investment in business is woefully weak			0

@entity169 : ‘ hard - working people are being held back by the scourge of zero hours contracts			0
’ reality : the number of people working full - time has risen by 1.42million			0
three - quarters of the rise in employment since the election has been in full - time jobs			0
three - fifths of the growth in employment since 2010 has been in higher skilled occupations			2
‘ no matter where you may be , you are sure to get everyone and neighbouring surroundings in the picture ’			0
verdict : yesterday was a big moment for the @entity37 , providing them with a chance to deliver a positive message after days of negative campaigning over @entity29 ’s tax and spending plans			0
it also dealt a significant blow to @entity66 ’s ‘ cost of living crisis ’ line of attack			0
the challenge for the @entity37 is to find a way of hammering home their economic successes – something they have failed to consistently do so far – without sounding triumphalist			0
not every family feels better - off yet			0
while it is of huge political significance that living standards are now higher than in may 2010 , the average household has only a tenner more to spend .			1
