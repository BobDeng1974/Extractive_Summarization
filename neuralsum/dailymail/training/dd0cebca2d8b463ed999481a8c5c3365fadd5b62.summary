' the audience reaction was fantastic - the limited release , in under 10 % of the amount of theaters originally planned , featured numerous sell - outs and a first - day gross over $ 1 million			0
' this despite receiving mixed to poor reviews from most critics			0
and though @entity41 and @entity11 representatives are keeping quiet about actual numbers , then @entity15 has topped the most viewed list on @entity10 and @entity11 since it became available on tuesday to rent for $ 5.99 or purchase for $ 16.99			2
