a popular health blogger who reportedly failed to donate $ 300,000 in profits to charity has now admitted she was ' wrong ' about the extent of her terminal cancer			1
the @entity6 founder @entity5 , whose app has about 200,000 followers , claims she was ' misdiagnosed ' by a doctor after announcing last year that life - threatening cancer had spread to her live , uterus , spleen and blood , the @entity16 reports			1
the 26 - year - old , who became a social media sensation when she launched her hit lifestyle and recipe app after being diagnosed with terminal brain cancer , says she feels ' humiliated ' after a @entity25 medical team 's examination led her to announce she was battling a third and fourth cancer			1
the latest revelations come just a day after it emerged that ms @entity5 may have misled her followers by failing to donate 25 per cent of the profits from the @entity6 - totaling $ 300,000 - to charity , despite promising she would			1
' it 's hard to admit that maybe you were wrong ... ( i felt ) confused , bordering on humiliated ' , ms @entity5 told the @entity16			1
she revealed a medical team from @entity25 had examined her using ' magnetic ' therapy and believes this investigation led to her misdiagnosis , although she declined to name the medical team			0
in july 2014 she broke the news of her illness to her followers through an impassioned post to her personal @entity61 page			0
it read in part : ' with frustration and ache in my heart / / my beautiful , gamechanging community , it hurts me to find space tonight to let you all know with love and strength that i 've been diagnosed with a third and fourth cancer			2
' one is secondary and the other is primary			0
i have cancer in my blood , spleen , brain , uterus , and liver			2
i am hurting , ' ms @entity5 wrote			1
around 12 weeks after the initial post she followed up her initial post , revealing she was undergoing ' @entity25 integrative oncology protocol '			0
' i 'm following the same , yet amplified holistic medicine treatment plan , taking what i need from each respected modality ; herbalism , acupuncture , nutrition etc and a new addition to it all with a @entity25 integrative oncology protocol			0
it took me a while , but i 'm back in ( adjusted ) full force and taking each day as it comes			0
' on monday @entity96 revealed ms @entity5 had not delivered on her promise to donate 25 per cent of the @entity6 's profits to charity , and reported she had lied about donating $ 300,000 in funds to a number of organisations			1
the @entity6 brand , which has hundreds of thousands of followers across social media platforms , is run by mother - of - one ms @entity5 , who charges $ 3.79 for the app ms @entity5 has almost 200,000 followers on her personal @entity61 account , who she has kept updated on her health and progress over the past few years			1
however there appear to be a number of inconsistencies in her medical history , age , and some recent ailments			0
the @entity16 reported that in 2009 she claimed to have undergone multiple heart surgeries where she died on the operating table , and months later was told by a doctor she had terminal brain cancer which left her only four months to live			1
she has said publicly that she was 20 at the time , but other documentation has indicated that she was born in 1991 , meaning she was 17 in 2009			0
many of ms @entity5 's social media postings from recent years have been removed , and her @entity61 account is now private			1
furthermore , when the @entity6 took to @entity125 on monday to defend the company , they appeared to be deleting comments questioning the validity of ms @entity5 's illness and business plan			1
the @entity6 brand , which has hundreds of thousands of followers across social media platforms , is run by mother - of - one ms @entity5 , who charges $ 3.79 for the app. at least five charities who purportedly had money raised for them through a number of campaigns run by ms @entity5 never saw any funds			1
the app , which has been downloaded over 300,000 times , proved so popular she was flown out to @entity142 last year where she was told her app was to be included on the @entity145			0
the 26 - year - old has publicly claimed that 25 per cent of the business ' profits were being donated to charity , last year claiming that $ 300,000 had been donated			2
however ms @entity5 told @entity96 this week that those donations had never been made , citing disappointing app sales and miscalculated profit margins			1
neither @entity154 's @entity153 or one girl - who were donated $ 1000 after questions were raised - received any money from ms @entity5 initially and the former claimed that it was n't aware money was being raised in its name			1
' in late 2013 the @entity6 advised one girl that they would be fundraising on our behalf in an online fundraising event , ' @entity162 , ceo , one girl told @entity167 in a statement			2
' in early 2015 one girl approached @entity5 from the @entity6 to enquire about when a donation would be made to one girl and how much was raised from the fundraising event			1
' she has also released a cookbook version of the creations following the success of the app ms @entity162 said one girl received a response from the @entity6 last week , which coincided with initial media inquiries into the business and they ' have since made a donation of $ 1,000 to one girl			2
' ' since this donation @entity164 has asked the @entity6 for confirmation of the total amount raised through the online event and are awaiting their response , ' ms @entity162 added			2
apparently only $ 7000 in total has reached charities so far , after campaigns flopped and profit margins were miscalculated			0
@entity189 , the publisher of ms @entity5 's book which was launched off the back of her app 's success said they did not see it necessary to seek confirmation on the entrepreneur 's medical history or age during their dealings with her			1
' @entity189 did not seek or receive documentary evidence of @entity5 's medical condition or birth date prior to publication , ' a spokesperson told @entity167			2
' we did not feel this was necessary as the @entity6 is a collection of food recipes , which @entity189 has published in good faith			2
' we are concerned about the questions raised in recent days - we 'll discuss them with @entity5 as ultimately only she can answer the questions , ' the spokesperson added			2
there were also revelations that neither the business nor ms @entity5 were lawfully registered as fundraising enterprises , a situation that could lead to huge fines and potential jail time			1
@entity167 has contacted the @entity6 for comment and while they could not be reached at the time of publishing , they had earlier posted a lengthy response on social media addressing some of claims made in the original article			2
there have been revelations that the @entity6 business nor ms @entity5 were lawfully registered as fundraising enterprises ms @entity5 has appeared across a number of networks ( pictured on @entity234 ) speaking about her approach to healing in the post to their @entity125 page the company clarified they were a ' for - profit ' company and claimed the discrepancy in funds was due to their inexperience in the industry			1
' we have , like all start ups , struggled with managing all facets of a new business , biting off more than we could chew , juggling internal and external priorities with little staff			0
' we have since passed our overdue business records and accounts over to an external business manager and accounts team , an issue we are reassured arises often with overwhelmed new businesses			0
' they have been working over our finances for the last five months , and are still proceeding with a resolution in close sight			0
we were advised by this team to follow their process and allow them to finalise the donations once all business keepings were accounted first and brought forward , ' the post read in part			0
' our books are taking longer to bring up to date than anticipated			0
@entity269 forecasted income in october 2014 which was not fulfilled , creating cash - flow issues and unforeseen delays on finalising three discussed charitable donations , ' another section of the post read			0
by citing ' cash flow issues ' as ms @entity5 did when explaining the business model and why charities had received no donations , the lengthy response garnered harsh criticism from commentators			1
last year it was revealed the app would feature on the new @entity283 watch apparently only $ 7000 of a projected $ 300,000 has reached charities so far , after campaigns flopped and profit margins were miscalculated ' appalling - your organisation not the media			2
money for charity does n't go into ' cash flow ' - that is beyond unethical , surely it 's illegal ? ' , one angry subscriber posted			0
' you have skipped the entire point in your very long and wordy response			0
you took money from people who gave you the money believing it would go to said charities , you failed to forward on the money , ' another poster wrote			0
' ... that my friends is dishonesty / theft in the highest degree and takes advantage of peoples good natures			0
shame on you , ' the comment continued			0
@entity167 has contacted @entity5 , the @entity6 , and a number of the charities who were to receive donations , for comment .			1

the @entity6 is a health and recipe app created by @entity5
ms @entity5 started it when she was diagnosed with brain cancer
the app was *advertised* as donating profits to charities
but @entity96 revealed none of the money has been donated
now is has also been claimed her cancer had not spread
ms @entity5 said she was ' humiliated ' and had been ' misdiagnosed '
