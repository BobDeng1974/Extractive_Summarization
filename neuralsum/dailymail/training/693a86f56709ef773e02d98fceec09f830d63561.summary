by @entity0 @entity1 claimed @entity2 - who died suddenly aged 26 in 2009 - was behind the wheel of her car when she was caught doing 36mph in a 30 zone a grandmother attempted to get out of a speeding ticket by claiming a dead man had been behind the wheel			1
@entity1 , 55 , from @entity11 , @entity12 , was caught driving 36mph in a 30mph zone near to her home in may last year			1
the grandmother , who already had nine points on her licence , claimed @entity2 - who died suddenly aged 26 in 2009 - was behind the wheel at the time			1
correspondence was sent to mr @entity2 - but was then returned by the new tenant of his former home			2
following an inquiry , it was discovered the information submitted by @entity1 could not be true and bought her in for questioning			2
there , @entity1 told probation workers she thought mr @entity2 ' family would ' find it funny ' , @entity30 heard			1
she later claimed she was filling in the speeding form at the same time as ordering a commemorative urn for mr @entity2 and got mixed up			1
@entity1 was due to deny the charge of perverting the course of justice and was facing a trial last month when she changed her plea			1
the judge , recorder @entity39 , gave the grandmother an indication last month that she would not be locked up if she pleaded guilty			1
however , @entity1 was given an eight - month prison sentence , suspended for two years , with supervision			2
after reading a report from the @entity47 following an interview they had with her , he said he felt like changing his mind			0
during the session , @entity1 showed no remorse , had no understanding how her crime had caused heartache , and found it humorous			0
the judge said : ' i believe you deliberately went out to avoid any points on your licence			0
' your explanation , which i saw in your defence statement , i find that nonsensical , and i do not accept it for one second			0
' the person whose details you gave had been dead for some four years			0
one can only imagine what the family of mr @entity2 went through			2
@entity71 ( pictured ) heard how the grandmother claimed she 'd accidentally entered mr @entity2 's name into speeding forms as she was ordering a commemorative urn for him at the same time ' had i known a lot of this from the pre-sentence report about you , i may well have had a different view about immediate custody			1
' you seem to have a total lack of conscience , a total lack of regard for the offending you carried out and the effect it might have on the deceased 's family , and you say they might have found it funny			0
' @entity92 , mitigating , told the court @entity1 had ' a number of challenges ' and is the carer for two of her 11 grandchildren			0
after the hearing , @entity1 still maintained it had been a mix - up			0
' i had a form for the urn and the speeding form on the table , it 's a madhouse in here at times , and i put the wrong name in , ' she said			0
after the case , mr @entity2 's distraught mother , @entity109 , said : ' i ca n't believe she could do this - how she could be so cruel			0
' ' it 's devastating , it 's disgusting , more so because she was a friend of @entity2 's			1
i do n't know how she thought we 'd find it funny			2

@entity1 , 55 , caught doing 36mph in a 30 zone in @entity11
@entity120 claimed @entity2 , who died in 2009 , was behind the wheel
in questioning , @entity1 said she thought @entity2 family would ' find it funny '
then said she 'd *mistakenly* filled in speeding forms with his name
pleaded guilty to perverting course of justice and given eight months in jail
*grieving* family *slammed* *actions* today as ' devastating ' and ' disgusting '
