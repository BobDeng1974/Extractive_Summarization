@entity8 , aged 18 months , suffers from hydrocephalus , a build up of fluid inside the skull			1
surgeons at the private hospital run by the @entity16 group , offered to treat @entity8 for free after pictures emerged of her living with the condition in a village in rural state of @entity22			1
appeal : the parents of a baby girl who suffers from a rare condition that caused her head to swell to nearly double its size have pleaded for more money to fund her treatment she underwent surgery last month , but her parents - whose daily income is just £ 2 a day - are struggling to foot the shortfall left by a string of complex procedures			1
so far the treatment needed to save the toddler is estimated to have cost between £ 33,000 and £ 36,000 - around 30 times initial predictions which placed the cost at just £ 1,120			1
currently @entity40 and @entity41 are between £ 11,000 and £ 13,000 short - with aftercare costs set to send the bill spiralling			1

@entity8 , aged 18 months , suffers from hydrocephalus , a build up of fluid inside the skull surgery : she underwent surgery last month , but her parents - whose daily income is just £ 2 a day - are struggling to foot the shortfall left by a string of complex procedures family : dr. @entity61 , left , removes the bandages from @entity8 's head life - saving : since being admitted the toddler 's head has been reduced through a series of life - saving surgeries global donations through @entity71 's website @entity72 have topped £ 23,000 , leaving @entity8 's desperate parents fearful for her future if they do n't receive more financial help			1
her mother @entity40 , 24 , who lives with husband @entity41 , 26 , said : ' to all those who have helped @entity8 , thank you			1
' she is already showing signs of happiness , and we can finally smile again			0
' but she needs more surgery to make her look right and we need to care for her future			2
we have no way of paying			0
' @entity8 faces months of reconstructive surgery to mould her disfigured skull back into shape			1
and she could still be left brain damaged or blind because of the swelling - which will increase the mammoth medical bill			1
illiterate bricklayer @entity41 added : ' with just one person working it is not possible to sustain the family and a child who needs treatment			0
my earnings are too low			0
success : doctors said the procedure went ' perfectly ' and that the results were ' better than expected ' chances : doctors have already said that the youngster is lucky to be alive , with most sufferers of the condition not surviving beyond a year old ' but we are very happy with the response we have got from people around the world and are hoping for the same in the future			1
' doctors have already said that the youngster is lucky to be alive , with most sufferers of the condition not surviving beyond a year old			2
director of neurosurgery dr. @entity61 , who has personally cared for @entity8 recently carried out the first of many costly @entity117 operations to reconstruct her disfigured skull			2
despite experts declaring @entity8 's tender life is no longer at risk , dr. @entity61 admits there are still challenges ahead			2
he said : ' we did not expect @entity8 to survive this long			2
we had a lot of worries initially			0
' the treatment has gone much better than initially expected			0
' the head size has reduced by about 30cm ( 12ins ) and has come down to around 54cm ( 21ins )			0
we aim to reduce this by another 10cm ( 4ins )			0
' her case has been very challenging as we do n't have any precedent to fall back on and nobody to guide you at any step			2
we have kept on reinventing ourselves everyday according to the situation			0
' now we really do n't expect much danger as her wounds are healing and she has also started eating orally			0
@entity8 's improved condition has also led her estranged grandparents , who initially rejected the ' abnormal ' child , to check up on her health - delighting both parents			1
@entity41 said : ' since the medical treatment started we have received a few calls from my parents and they do inquire about @entity8			1
before : @entity149 holds his 18 - month - old daughter in front of their home before her operation ' this makes me happy as earlier they refused to accept her as their granddaughter because of her head size - but thanks to every one who helped us @entity8 is going to have her grandparents			1
' there is a lot of difference in her head size than before and we are very happy about it			0
' the doctors and everyone here at the hospital have done their best to help us and i hope everything ends soon so that we can have our daughter back			0
' @entity40 added : ' @entity8 is responding to the treatment and there are changes in her behaviour as earlier she was playing with us			2
' i get afraid and feel sad when i look at the scars that are there after the surgery			0
' i know it 's for her own good but as a mother it 's difficult for me to see this little girl going through all these operations			0
' we are looking forward to taking @entity8 back home so she can start her life as a normal child			2

@entity8 , 18 months , suffers from a *severe* case of hydrocephalus
doctors drain fluid from her brain and say surgery went ' perfectly '
but more funds are needed to help supporting the 18 - month - old
parents estimate they are between £ 11,000 and £ 13,000 short
