by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:09 est , 10 february 2013 updated : 15:39 est , 11 february 2013 bills for long - term care in old age are to be capped at £ 75,000 in @entity6 , in a £ 1billion move to be funded by dragging more people into the inheritance tax net , it was announced today			1
health secretary @entity10 said that the ' historic ' reforms would save thousands of people from having to sell their family home to pay for care and give them ' greater peace of mind '			1
' we need to become a society where people prepare and plan for their social care costs as much as they prepare and plan for their pension , ' he said , adding that all governments have ' long failed to tackle ' the issue			0
' the inheritance tax threshold will be frozen until at least 2019 to help fund the £ 75,000 cap on care home bills for the elderly			1
it means that thousands more middle - class families every year will be dragged into paying the 40 per cent tax			1
sources close to chancellor @entity50 confirmed that some of the funding for radical reform of social care will come from an unexpected freeze in the amount people can inherit free of tax			1
stealth tax ? sources close to @entity50 say the inheritance tax threshold is to be frozen to fund a £ 75,000 cap on care home bills the move risks angering conservative mps who remember mr @entity50 pledging in 2007 , before the financial crisis , to increase the threshold to £ 1million			1
instead it has been fixed at £ 325,000 since the election and will remain at that level until at least april 2019			2
the @entity70 will announce today that the state will fund all social care for any individual once the £ 75,000 cap has been reached			0
the state will also begin to help with costs if a person ’s savings and assets fall below a threshold of £ 123,000 , rather than £ 23,250 at present			1
but the @entity80 argues that the £ 75,000 cap is too high and warns that elderly people will continue to lose their homes as they grapple to meet mounting care costs			0
the reforms are expected to cost £ 1billion a year , 80 per cent of which will come from increased employer national insurance contributions – mainly in the public sector – as a flat - rate state pension replaces the state second pension			1
but the remaining 20 per cent will come from the inheritance ‘ stealth tax ’			1
if the threshold for the tax , frozen since 2009 , increased in line with inflation every year until 2019 it would be expected to reach £ 420,000			1
but instead it will be fixed at £ 325,000 – although just two months ago the chancellor suggested he would increase the allowance in two years			2
as a result , 5,000 more families a year are expected to be pulled into the inheritance tax trap , and will pay an average of £ 95,000 more than they would have done if the allowance had been increased			1
@entity50 's pledge in 2007 a government source said : ‘ the result of the social care reforms will be that 100,000 people who would have had to pay will be helped			1
the inheritance tax allowance has been frozen since 2009 , but it ’s also been made transferable so a couple now has a threshold of £ 650,000			1
‘ yes , it will bring 5,000 more people into inheritance tax but it will help more than 100,000 who currently suffer for daring to do the right thing and saving for retirement			0
‘ those who have worked and saved all their life and bought a property wo n’t have it taken away just because they did the right thing			0
‘ we are going to protect their inheritance			0
’ hit with taxes : @entity132 ( right ) , a former adviser to the @entity130 on pensions , said well - off pensioners with expensive houses would be hit by the inheritance tax changes while @entity136 ( left ) said it looks as if the government is ' giving with one hand , and taking away with the other ' however , conservative @entity141 expressed alarm			2
right - winger @entity136 said : ‘ it starts to look as if we are giving with one hand and taking away with the other			0
’ the @entity70 is setting the £ 75,000 cap despite the @entity148 , established by @entity138 to review care funding in @entity6 , recommending a lower benchmark			0
the commission proposed a cap of between £ 20,000 and £ 50,000 and said £ 35,000 would be ' the most appropriate and fair ' figure			0
but chairman @entity154 said the difference between the recommendation and the government 's figure is not large enough to create problems			0
he told @entity160 's today : ' we said it should be between £ 20,000 and £ 50,000 in 2010 - 11 prices			2
' the cap being proposed is £ 75,000 in 2017 prices , that ’s the equivalent of £ 61,000 in our terms , £ 11,000 higher than the top end of our range			0
' but i recognise that the public finances are in a pretty tricky state and it does n’t seem to me that it is so different as to radically transform the basis of the system			0
' but @entity175 , general secretary of the @entity80 ( @entity80 ) , said : ‘ people are still going to lose their homes to pay for this , £ 75,000 is a hugely high cap			2
' in actual fact , @entity179 said 35 or 50			0
but in any case , we did n’t think @entity179 was the right answer either because it does n’t deal with the actual care system			0
' ms @entity175 called for a 1.5p in the pound income tax to pay for a national care system ' free at the point of delivery '			2
@entity190 - @entity189 , also from the @entity80 , said he could see little difference between the freezing of the inheritance tax threshold and @entity195 ’s plan before the election for a ‘ death tax ’ to pay for care			1
@entity132 , a former adviser to the @entity130 on pensions , said relatively well - off pensioners with expensive houses – particularly in the @entity202 – would be hit by the inheritance tax changes			2
‘ many people who end up not needing any expensive care in their old age will end up paying lots of inheritance tax to those who do , ’ she added .			0

it means thousands of middle - class families will have to pay 40 per cent tax
@entity50 had pledged to increase the threshold to £ 1m in 2007
