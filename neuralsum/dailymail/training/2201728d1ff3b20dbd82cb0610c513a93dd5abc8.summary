mr @entity3 would have been treated to panoramic views of @entity42 , one of @entity18 's main thoroughfares , and the city 's historic @entity45			1
the @entity48 leader , who was accompanied by three officials , has refused to disclose how much he spent on this weeklong jaunt , dismissing criticism as ' ridiculous frippery '			0
but the majority of the ' @entity55 ' delegation in the @entity2 at the same time stayed in a more modest hotel near the @entity59 golf course , which charges £ 60 for a room			1
the entire trip cost taxpayers nearly £ 500,000			2
the new figures also show that mr @entity3 's bill for a four - day trip to @entity65 in 2012 was £ 8,197 , where he attended the movie premiere of the @entity27 / @entity69 film @entity68			1

@entity93 chief whip @entity107 accused the @entity9 of being ' secretive ' about the spending			0
he said : ' the sheer expense of some trips has to be questioned , especially with so many officials accompanying people like the first minister abroad			0
' the fact the @entity9 took several months to publish will also arouse suspicion			0
if ministers did not have something to hide , why were they so secretive ?

' given the bill he is running up , @entity3 seems more interested in having a good time than winning jobs and investment			0
' but a spokesman for finance secretary @entity136 said : ' this is the height of hypocrisy from a @entity139 which , in government at @entity141 , thinks nothing of spending £ 13million in a year on flights and hotels for the @entity145			2
' meanwhile , the [ @entity148 @entity9 's ] @entity147 's bill for domestic flights has almost doubled in just two years to more than £ 130,000			2
