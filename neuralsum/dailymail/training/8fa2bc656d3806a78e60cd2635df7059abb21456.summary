@entity1 , 53 , head of @entity13 near @entity3 , had wanted a week off after the @entity15 holidays ended for an exotic beach break			1
this was despite it being after the start of school term and parents being told in no uncertain terms that they can not take their children out of lessons			2
today @entity25 confirmed mrs @entity1 has ' cancelled the proposed leave and will be in work from the start of the new spring term on the january 5 , 2015 '			1
earlier today parent governor reverend @entity30 called on mrs @entity1 to cancel her holiday and apologise because her proposed holiday was blatant ' double standards '			1
he also said she sent a letter to parents falsely claiming her holiday was ' unanimously ' backed by governors like him			1
her school , which she has run for 14 years , warns had parents who take their children out of school during term time facing fines of £ 60 per child for unauthorised absences			2
mrs @entity1 had refused to give an explanation or apologise for trying to take the time off			1
she said : ' my private life is exactly what it says - private			1
' her holiday was approved as ' appropriate ' by a sub-committee of the school 's governors and chairman @entity49 said mrs @entity1 was ' devoted ' and ' well - liked '			1
but parent governor @entity53 said the sub-committee was presented with the decision as though it had already been made			0
he said he raised it with mr @entity49 because he had ' misgivings about the double - standard of a head teacher taking a holiday in term - time '			0
he added that mrs @entity1 sent a letter to parents saying the vote to allow her to take the holiday was ' unanimous ' despite this being untrue			1
@entity65 , who is rector at three local churches , said he wanted to clarify his own position and said mrs @entity68 should apologise to staff and parents and cancel her holiday			2

' complaint : local vicar and governor reverend @entity30 said that the head should say sorry and cancel her holiday - and also claims a letter she sent to parents about the issue was untrue rebellions : a letter said governors at @entity88 , pictured , approved mrs @entity1 's holiday ' unanimously ' but now one , the local vicar , says this is untrue and he expressed concerns in its last @entity94 inspection in 2009 , @entity88 was rated as outstanding and mrs @entity1 is thought to be paid around £ 45,000 a year			1
the website for the school , which caters for four to 11 - year - olds reminds parents to book breaks ' only in holiday time ' and encourages pupils to achieve ' highest possible levels of attendance '			2
it adds that the school ' will not authorise ' such absences and parents are fined £ 60 per parent per child per period of absence , which rises to £ 120 if not paid within 21 days			0
on her friends reunited page , the head describes herself as a former pe teacher now ‘ too old , fat and unfit ’ to teach the subject so has become a head instead			0

some parents , whose children attend the school , pictured , have branded mrs @entity1 ' a hypocrite ' for booking the holiday ' this is so unfair as teachers already get so many holidays and yet we would n't be allowed to take our children out of school for even a day			1
' parents who have branded mrs @entity1 a ' hypocrite ' for taking a holiday during school time have pointed to new measures , which mean they can be fined for taking their children on a term - time holiday			1
previously , head teachers had the discretion to allow pupils up to 10 days of leave from school each year			0
however , under new measures brought in by former education secretary @entity150 , children can only be taken out of school in ' exceptional circumstances '			0

in the @entity25 area , where @entity2 is located , 432 parents were issued with a fixed penalty notice for taking their children out of school , when their absence was not authorised between september 2013 and july 2014			2
this compares to just 39 fixed penalty notices , which were issued between september 2012 and july 2013			0
earlier this year , one of the first couples to be prosecuted for taking their family on holiday during term time were @entity168 and @entity169 from @entity170			0
the couple took their three children @entity173 , six , @entity174 , 13 , and @entity175 , 15 , to the @entity177 island of @entity178 last september			0
mr @entity179 , who works for the @entity180 said at the time that it was the first family holiday in five years as the couple had struggled to get time off work together			0
after refusing to pay the fines , they were prosecuted at @entity186 and fined £ 630			0
speaking at the time mr @entity179 said : ' i know education is important but there 's a bigger picture			0
family time is important too			0
' it has been estimated that more than 24,000 children skip school every day to go on family holidays as parents ignore the threat of fines to escape peak - time price hikes .			2

@entity1 , 53 , was to *fly* to the @entity5 after the @entity15 holidays
parents taking children out of school for holidays are warned they face fines
