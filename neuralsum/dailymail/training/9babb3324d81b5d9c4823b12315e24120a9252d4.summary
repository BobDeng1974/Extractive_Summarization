by @entity0 published : 11:08 est , 17 may 2013 updated : 06:25 est , 18 may 2013 @entity1 has been hit with a bill for thousands of dollars by the @entity4 animal shelter where his confiscated pet monkey has been held for two months			1
the 19 - year - old singer has until midnight to reclaim @entity7 , a capuchin monkey , and will have to pay up for his care even if he does not take the animal back			1
@entity7 will be transferred to a permanent home at a @entity4 zoo or animal park if @entity1 does not take him back in time			1
@entity7 was seized by @entity4 customs march 28 when @entity1 failed to produce required vaccination and import papers after landing in @entity18 while on tour			1
the monkey was given to the singer for his 19th birthday last month from music producer @entity34 and had been taken away from his mother when he was only nine weeks old			1
the now 20 - week - old animal was quarantined and cared for at @entity18 's animal shelter , where manager @entity38 said @entity7 had fared well and gained weight			1
the shelter has criticized @entity1 for keeping such a young monkey as a pet , saying it should n't have been taken away from its mother until it was a year old			1
experts say capuchin monkeys also need to be kept in groups as they are very sociable animals			0
@entity1 must pay for @entity7 's care whether he takes the monkey back or not ' the best thing would be not to buy one at all , but if you do , buy five , ' said mr @entity38			1
he said emails from @entity1 's management to the animal shelter indicated the singer does not want the monkey anymore , but that the final decision would have to be made by @entity4 authorities			1
' our contact is the person that the monkey belongs to , ' said mr @entity27			0
' we 've had contact with lots of people but none of them was an authorised representative			0
' he said the cost of care , food and vet visits at the @entity18 shelter amounted to several thousand ( dollars )			2
' you can bet we are going to ask for that money back , ' he said			0
@entity7 the monkey is now in quarantine at a @entity4 animal shelter the capuchin monkey , taken from its mother at nine weeks , is treating a cuddly toy as its surrogate parent normally capuchin monkeys remain with their mothers for at least the first year of their life			1
he is now in quarantine in a @entity18 animal sanctuary where his only companion is a cuddly toy that he treats as a surrogate mother			2
@entity7 also spends his time repeatedly calling out in the hope of finding other members of his family group - something which mr @entity38 , 64 , described last month as ' heartbreaking '			2
he said at the time : ' @entity1 has won an extension because the four week limit on confiscated animals only applies if the owner does not get in touch			2
' however his management team had been in touch and indicated that they want the monkey back which means they now have as much time as they need to get the paperwork ready			0
' if that takes months then it 's months that they have			0
but that just is n't acceptable for the baby monkey needs company and to be with other monkeys at this crucial age in its life			0
' we 'll appeal to the star to do the decent thing and let the monkey be free for adoption			0
' there are a great many suitable places that have offered to take @entity7 and integrate him with their own capuchin monkeys where he would be much more happy with his own kind			2
' a baby monkey is not something suitable to be on a world tour even if he is travelling by private jet			0
' he should be out in the wild climbing trees and learning from other monkeys if he is n't to have serious psychological problems later in life			0
' the boss of the @entity18 animal shelter asked @entity1 to do ' the decent thing ' and let the animal be adopted @entity7 spends his time repeatedly calling in the hope of finding other members of his family group , animal shelter staff said a @entity4 customs spokesman said at the time of the confiscation that @entity1 lacked documents certifying compliance with animal health and species - protection regulations			1
mr @entity38 said if it took months to sort out the paperwork and all that time was spent in a cage it would do irreparable damage to the monkey 's mental state			0
he said if @entity1 were to refuse to allow the monkey to be adopted by a suitable organisation then the only hope lay with the @entity168 environment ministry			2
however the @entity169 has so far declined to comment on the case .			0

@entity7 the capuchin monkey was held by customs officials in @entity18
