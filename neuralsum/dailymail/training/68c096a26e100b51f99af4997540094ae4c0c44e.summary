by @entity0 a rare picture of @entity2 , the @entity3 gentleman who arrived in @entity4 in 1894 with a football under each arm and introduced the country to the sport it is a scene almost impossible to imagine today for reasons @entity12 football fans will readily understand			1
a @entity13 arrives in a @entity4 port with a football under each arm , attracting quizzical looks from the locals who wonder what the spherical objects are for			1
the @entity21 demonstrates with a flash of his skills on the ball and the @entity4 gape in awe at the wizardry on display			2
today , as @entity4 fans eagerly anticipate their country ’s bid for a sixth @entity33 win – this time on home soil – there is little any country , far less @entity12 , can teach them about football			1
but 120 years ago , this is essentially how the world ’s greatest football nation discovered the sport			1
the man who stepped off the boat in @entity43 in 1894 was @entity2 , son of a @entity45 boatyard clerk who had left his home town to build a new life in @entity48			1
coincidentally , he began playing the game in @entity50 at the same time another @entity21 , @entity52 - born factory worker @entity51 , was helping to popularise it in @entity54			2
a statue was unveiled there last year to honour @entity51 ’s role but historians now agree @entity2 was the first to organise a match played under @entity61 rules in @entity4			1
and , far - fetched as it may seem , it is even suggested 5ft 5in @entity2 ’s dribbling and passing style became the blueprint for the @entity4 ’ trademark mode of play			1
he was too short to be any real threat in the air – but his trick of flicking the ball over his head with the back of the heel is still known in @entity4 as ‘ chaleira ’ , derived from the @entity13 ’s name			2
@entity2 ’s father had left his job in @entity45 to strike out on his own in @entity4 in the 1860s			1
by the time he met and married @entity82 , daughter of the richest @entity83 in town , he had already landed a job as a high - powered railway engineer			0
@entity50 and @entity54 select teams pose in front of the train taking the @entity90 home after the first ever match between the rival cities @entity2 is pictured in the middle of the front row of the @entity95 assembled in 1904 his son @entity100 was sent to a boarding school , @entity96 in @entity97 , for a ‘ proper @entity83 ’ education , and it was there he first kicked a football			1
on the pitch , @entity2 earned the nickname @entity105 for his deftness on the ball and eye for goal and , at 17 , he was spotted by the local @entity111 ’s side , which later became @entity97			2
he then joined @entity112 , the legendary @entity113 amateur club , which boasted some of the best players in the world			0

@entity2 , pictured right , dazzled @entity4 with his footballing skills @entity2 ' shows off the ' wizardry ' that inspired people in @entity4 to take up football 120 years ago			1
he is pictured with the ball in the @entity50 against @entity54 select match of 1901 when @entity2 finished school at age 19 , he had scored a remarkable 45 goals in 34 matches in his latest season and was widely expected to turn professional			1
but it seemed he had a higher calling in @entity48			0
@entity2 was amazed to find football was practically unknown in @entity4			1
the @entity3 expat community ’s pastime of choice was cricket , apparently much better suited to the tropical heat			0
the crowd watches on at a title play - off involving @entity144 and another side for the first league of @entity4 in 1902 but he did not see it that way			0
he waited until autumn , when the cricket bats had been put away , and seized his chance			0
on april 14 , 1895 , on a scrubby field on the floodplains of a river in central @entity50 – after some cattle were moved out of the way – @entity2 played in the first full football match on @entity4 soil			1
‘ what a nice little game , ’ he said later of the encounter			0
his @entity161 side beat the @entity162 comfortably by 4 - 2			0

@entity2 is pictured second from left in the front row a poster commemorating @entity95 's three championships in a row from 1902 - 1905			0
@entity2 is pictured at the centre in the bottom the @entity4 fans watched bemused as first the rudiments then the subtleties of the game were presented to them			1
they seemed to get it			0
one local journalist was on the right lines when he wrote : ‘ it gives them great satisfaction or fills them with great sorrow when this kind of yellowish bladder enters a rectangle formed by wooden posts			0
’ in 1901 , the country ’s first league was founded in @entity50 and at its conclusion @entity2 ’s @entity95 – a team of expats – and @entity50 , made up entirely of @entity4 , were tied			1
son of a @entity12 dad and an @entity83 mum , @entity195 was born in @entity50 less than 10 miles from the new @entity199 @entity2 kicks off friendly between two of his old clubs @entity97 and @entity144 in @entity50 in 1948 a family photo in @entity50 with @entity2 as a two - year - old sitting on the bench they met in a play - off for the title			0
after @entity50 drew first blood , @entity2 scored twice to lift – and drink champagne from – the first ever championship cup			0
@entity2 was also behind rival cities @entity50 and @entity90 meeting up for the first time			0
but the biggest victor of all was football			0
what began in @entity4 as a game for the white elite and impeccably dressed supporters who greeted every goal with cries of ‘ hip hip hurray ’ became a game for the masses			2
@entity2 is pictured sitting far right with members of the @entity226 squad in 1894 when @entity2 , pictured left with his @entity228 team and right with a @entity229 , finished school , he had scored a remarkable 45 goals in 34 matches in his latest season and was widely expected to turn professional before long , the sight of children kicking anything spherical around the streets was ubiquitous			2
they were infused with the rhythm , individualism and playfulness still evident in @entity4 football with stars such as @entity244 becoming household names			2
there is no doubt about the significance of @entity2 ’s contribution to @entity4 football			1
by the time of his death in 1953 , @entity4 had hosted its first @entity33			1
‘ few have captured the imagination of an entire nation like he did , ’ said a news - paper obituary			0
years later @entity4 would go on to become global footballing superpowers			2
pictured left to right , @entity256 , @entity257 and @entity258 celebrate winning the @entity33 in 2002			0
