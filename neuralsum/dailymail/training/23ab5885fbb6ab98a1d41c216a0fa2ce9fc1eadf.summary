fresh questions over the authenticity of the ' @entity4 ' papyrus have been raised after a text from the same collection written in the same handwriting was proved to be a fake , experts say			1
written in ancient @entity9 , the @entity4 seemingly indicates @entity10 was married as it reads : ' @entity10 said to them , " my wife " ' and ' … she will be able to be my disciple … ' since then , historians and religious leaders have attempted to both prove and deny the artefact 's credibility			1
last month , carbon testing on the papyrus seemed to suggest it was written between the fourth and eighth centuries and was therefore authentic			1
however , experts say another fragment from the same collection as the ' @entity10 's wife ' papyrus is a fake - casting doubts on the legitimacy of the latter			1
the discovery of a scrap of papyrus in 2012 ( pictured ) that claimed @entity10 had a wife caused a holy row of words over its authenticity the forgery - a fragment of the canonical @entity42 - is also written in the same handwriting , with the same writing instrument and ink - which for some proves once and for all the @entity10 's wife piece is fake			1
writing in a blog for @entity48 , @entity49 - an associate professor of @entity50 at @entity51 - and @entity52 - a professor of @entity53 and early @entity54 at the @entity55 - said : ' it ’s never a good sign for a text of doubtful authenticity to be found in the company of a sure forgery			2
' more directly : multiple experts agree that the fragment of @entity63 and the @entity10 ’ wife papyrus are written in the same hand , using the same ink and even the same writing instrument			1
' simply put : if one is a forgery , they ’re both forgeries			0
' @entity71 , a @entity9 specialist and assistant research professor at @entity73 told @entity74 of the @entity75 : ' the fragment [ of @entity63 ] contains exactly the same hand , exactly the same ink and has been written with the same writing instrument [ as the “ @entity10 ’ wife ” fragment ]			1
the online version of @entity42 , page 7 ( left ) compared to the @entity63 fragment ( right )			1
the red lines indicate how much was lifted from the online source same handwriting ? experts claim the ' @entity4 ' ( left ) and the @entity42 ( right ) were written ' in exactly the same hand , exactly the same ink and has been written with the same writing instrument ' one would assume that it were part of the same writing event , be it modern or ancient			1
in some sense , this is not a surprise , as the @entity95 indicated that the ink was very similar			2
' debate over the fragment 's authenticity is set to continue as some will no doubt question these latest findings			2
the artefact was first shown to the world around 18 months ago by respected @entity104 , professor @entity105			0
the collection of documents , which were given to professor @entity105 anonymously , immediately caused a stir , with some using it to prove @entity10 was married instead of celibate - a view which could undermine some of the @entity113 's main teachings			1
the papyrus ’ back side , or verso , is so badly damaged that only a few key words - ' my mother ' and ' three ' - were decipherable , but on the front side , or recto , professor @entity105 gleaned eight fragmentary lines : at the time , a furious @entity124 newspaper dismissed the find as a fake			1
one editor , @entity127 , wrote a stinging piece entitled ' at any rate , a fake			2
' other holes in its authenticity were also reported			0
some claimed that - for a small scrap the size of a business card - the fragment seemed to contain a lot of important information			1
as well as suggesting @entity10 had a wife , it also described someone called @entity144 as ' worthy ' and capable of being a disciple			0
the handwriting was also deemed to be untidy , while some drew comparisons between the document and another @entity151 text , called the ' @entity152			2
' at the time , @entity53 expert professor @entity153 of @entity154 said that the fragment was a collage of texts from @entity152 which had been copied and reassembled out of order in bad ancient @entity9			2
however , the scrap did have faint traces of ink which had been worn away - perhaps suggesting it was a true document			1
also , some experts highlighted text used in ancient papyruses if often reproduced from other sources			2
the piece was finally submitted for carbon testing last month			0
there , scientists proved the papyrus itself and the ink were genuine			2
ancient : the back side , or verso , of the papyrus			0
new evidence suggests this document is a fake as another papyrus in the collection - which is written in the same handwriting - has been proved to be a forgery the papyrus was examined by electrical engineering , chemistry and biology experts from @entity188 , @entity189 and the @entity190 ( @entity190 ) who declared the parchment was indeed several hundred years old			1
the study , published in the @entity194 , revealed the document was found to date to eighth century @entity196 , around 400 years later than professor @entity105 originally thought			2
critics have said that the fragment is a collage of pieces of the @entity152 by someone with a dubious grasp of ancient @entity9			2
one scholar even claims to have found a typo in an online edition of the gospel , which matches one in what they say is a forgery			0
other experts have claimed that ink pooling suggests that the document was created in modern times			1
@entity215 , an egyptologist at @entity216 , said that none of the new tests have convinced him that the papyrus is a fake			2
he wrote in the @entity194 that a forger may have ‘ wanted to put his or her own spin on modern theological issues ’ such as celibacy and the role of women in the @entity113			0
‘ as a forgery , it is bad to the point of being farcical or fobbish			0
. i do n’t buy the argument that this is sophisticated			0
i think it could be done in an afternoon by an undergraduate student , ’ he said			0
the provenance of the papyrus has also been questioned			0
the owner of the document has asked to remain anonymous but said that he acquired the artefact along with five other papyri in 1999 from a collector who got them in the 1960s in @entity243			0
additional tests showed that the ink ’s chemical composition is consistent with other inks used by the ancient @entity196 , while microscopic imaging found no suspicious ink pooling that critics of the papyrus said was evidence of the ink being applied in more recent times			1
at the same time , other papyri from the collection were tested for means of comparison			0
one of those was a fragment from the canonical gospel ' of @entity63 written in a rare ancient dialect of @entity9 known as @entity263			1
a @entity263 version of @entity63 , which was first published in 1924 , is now available online			2
cross comparisons show the online @entity63 text was very similar to the ' ancient ' papyrus , @entity48 reports			1
furthermore , carbon dating of the @entity63 fragment suggests it was from the seventh to ninth centuries			1
the @entity263 dialect died out as a language sometime before the sixth century - a great deal of time before the papyrus was written			1
experts are now saying this is evidence that the whole collection is a fake			1
professor @entity105 has previously said the document does not necessarily prove @entity10 had a wife - but questions @entity151 ideas of women , marriage and celibacy			1
she said previsouly : ‘ i ’m basically hoping that we can move past the issue of forgery to questions about the significance of this fragment for the history of @entity54 , for thinking about questions like , “ why does @entity10 being married , or not , even matter ? ” why is it that people had such an incredible reaction to this ? ’ professor @entity105 originally interpreted the document as a debate about celibacy			2
‘ now when i come back and read the fragment , it seems the major issue being talked about was that @entity10 was affirming that wives and mothers can be his disciples , ’ she said in an interview earlier this week			0
professor @entity105 - whose discovery of the papyrus caused controversy back in 2012 at the time the papyrus was announced , professor @entity105 told @entity315 that the fragment casts doubt ' on the whole @entity319 claim of a celibate priesthood based on @entity10 ’ celibacy			1
' she said : ' what this shows is that there were early @entity326 for whom ... sexual union in marriage could be an imitation of @entity331 ’s creativity and it could be spiritually proper and appropriate			0
' professor @entity105 speculated that the so - called ' @entity333 ' may have been thrown out ' because the ideas it contained flowed so strongly against the ascetic currents of the tides in which @entity151 practices and understandings of marriage and sexual intercourse were surging			0
' this representation of @entity10 as a man with earthly passions and needs has not survived in the doctrines of the established churches , which emphasise celibacy and asceticism as a spiritual ideal			0
many people over the centuries have tried to work out a ' bloodline ' for possible descendants of @entity10 and @entity355			0
many historians agree that there is no historical , biblical , archaeological or genetic evidence to support the idea			0
but the fragment of papyrus that is said to be a translation of a lost gospel has @entity10 referring to ' my wife ' a 13th century @entity367 monk and historian @entity366 claimed that @entity10 had a relationship with @entity355			1
early @entity371 leaders stated that @entity10 as polygamous based upon an obscure passage attributed to a second century @entity374 philosopher called @entity375			0
in the 19th century , a politician called @entity377 published a ' history ' book that claimed @entity10 was married to @entity144 and that they both travelled to the @entity380 where they had a son			0
subsequent books have claimed @entity10 fathered a child with @entity144 - or possibly had more offspring with a @entity387 woman			0
author @entity388 interviewed one person who claimed to be a @entity387 descendant of @entity10			0
@entity355 has also been said to be the mother of @entity392 , while another author claims @entity10 and @entity144 are the ancestors of all the @entity396 royal families .			0

' fragment from same collection as @entity4 is fake ' - experts
gospel of @entity63 papyrus was written in same handwriting and ink
experts from @entity409 *universities* used carbon dating to prove both fragments were written between the fourth and eighth centuries
but critics say this does not prove the legitimacy of the document
