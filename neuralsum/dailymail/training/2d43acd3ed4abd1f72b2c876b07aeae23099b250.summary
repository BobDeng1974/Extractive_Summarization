@entity0 , pictured , only received five replies from @entity3 people when he advertised for workers for his new deli opening a delicatessen in a jobless blackspot might have been expected to generate a flood of applications from locals eager to snap up the ten posts on offer			1
but @entity0 was shocked by the response when he advertised for staff for his venture near the @entity17 ’s gleaming northern complex in @entity18			1
the jobless rate is nearly one - and - a - half times the national average – but only five out of the 70 hopefuls with the right skills were @entity3			2
the remainder were immigrants from @entity26 or @entity27			0
out of the @entity3 candidates , only two turned up for an interview to be rewarded with jobs where they will be paid £ 8 - an - hour plus tips			1
the extraordinary statistic will add to fears that unemployed @entity3 who are used to life on benefits can not match the work ethic of new arrivals			1
mr @entity0 is expanding from his original well - received branch in the relatively prosperous @entity42 suburb of @entity43			1
although he has a phd in chemical engineering , the 42 - year - old @entity44 set up a deli in 2003 after coming to @entity3 in the 1990s following the @entity49 conflict			2
yesterday mr @entity0 told of his surprise that so few locals had applied for his jobs			1
his experience showed why many employers felt they could not manage without foreign labour , he added ‘ i feel if you put a stop to immigration , you might struggle because it simply did n’t happen , ’ he said on a @entity57 discussion on immigration			0
‘ @entity64 people did n’t want to work			0
in my view it ’s just supply and demand			0
’ last month , the @entity68 asked : ‘ is there no - one left in @entity3 who can make a sandwich ? ’ this followed the revelation that @entity74 , which supplies major supermarkets , was looking in @entity76 to fill 300 posts at its new @entity79 factory as too few @entity3 would do the job			2
mr @entity0 told the @entity68 that he would have preferred to have more local staff at his new deli			1
‘ for front of house , it ’s actually an advantage to me if people are @entity3 because they ’re better at communicating with customers			2
‘ but the people who applied were predominantly @entity90 , with quite a few @entity27 and other nationalities like @entity92 , and hardly any @entity64 , ’ he said			0
mr @entity0 said he only invited those with relevant experience for interview although the positions included low - skill posts such as three kitchen porters			1
‘ it tends to be mainly foreign nationals who apply for jobs across the catering industry – i suppose they have no choice – but i ’m paying well above minimum wage with tips on top , ’ he added			0
‘ i ’m very pleased with the staff i ’ve recruited			0
they ’ve got a good work ethic , they ’re never late and they ’re very hard - working			0
we ’re a happy @entity114 family ! ’ mr @entity0 's new venture is only a short distance from the @entity17 's media city in @entity18 , pictured all the staff at his first delicatessen are local @entity3 workers although the area has much lower unemployment			1
for his @entity18 venture , mr @entity0 advertised on recruitment websites , mainly attracting foreign nationals living in the area			1
in future , he plans to use local job creation initiatives in the hope of attracting a broader range of applicants			0
his latest project is perfectly placed to attract custom from the high - rise @entity134 complex , now the base of @entity137 and @entity57 as well as @entity138 and @entity139			0
according to the most recent figures , 11,900 people were unemployed in @entity18 in the year to last june , a rate of 10.1 per cent compared to 6.8 per cent nationally			2
across @entity146 , only @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 had a higher unemployment rate			0
work and pensions secretary @entity148 has claimed that the last @entity150 ’s ‘ open - door ’ policy led to a huge influx of low - skilled migrant workers while its welfare system discouraged @entity3 from working .			2

only five @entity3 applied for a post in @entity0 's new @entity18 deli
of the five @entity3 applicants , only two of them turned up for an interview
mr @entity0 was surprised so few @entity3 applied to work in his deli
the new shop is near the @entity17 's media city complex in @entity18
