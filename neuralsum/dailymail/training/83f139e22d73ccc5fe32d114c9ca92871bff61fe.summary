the apology , which is published in full on ms @entity92 's blog under a post she titled ' my daughter thanks you too ' , reads : ' anybody who is familiar with our brand would probably know that we are strong proponents of free speech and pushing the limits of humour – we are a " cash for chaos " kind of company			0

it 's important that we call out sexism wherever it exists			0
