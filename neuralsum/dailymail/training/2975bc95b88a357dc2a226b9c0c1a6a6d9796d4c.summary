by @entity0 published : 11:33 est , 1 november 2012 updated : 14:26 est , 1 november 2012 a seven - year - old girl has become one of the first children in the @entity4 to have stem cells banked using her baby teeth - after they were extracted by her dentist father			1
@entity11 ’s parents @entity8 and @entity9 decided to freeze and store their daughter ’s milk teeth so the youngster can take advantage of future medical advances in stem cell research			1
stem cells from bone marrow and umbilical cord blood have been used for decades to treat leukaemia and other blood - related diseases			1
@entity23 with @entity11 who is one of the first children in the @entity4 to have her stem cells banked from her teeth teeth are an ' incredible source ' of stem cells , mr @entity23 said , and researchers are studying how they could be used to treat a number of diseases and conditions including diabetes , spinal cord injuries , stroke and liver problems			1
@entity11 , who lives in @entity37 , @entity38 , had her two wobbly front teeth removed by her father at his @entity42 dental practice @entity41			1
the dental pulp from the milk teeth will be collected , frozen and stored for 30 years or more until needed			1
@entity11 said the extraction was ' a little bit sore ' but that her real concern was about the tooth fairy			0
' i wrote a wee letter to her to explain and she sent me back £ 5 , ' she said			0
doctors have already used dental cells to regenerate dental bone and treat periodontal disease , said mr @entity23			1
@entity11 holding one of her milk teeth			2
her parents were too late to arrange taking stem cells from her umbilical cord the dentist and his wife started to think about banking stem cells around the time of @entity11 ’s birth but were too late to arrange for cells to be taken from the umbilical cord			2
they got the idea of using their daughter ’s teeth after seeing a leaflet for cell banking company @entity71 at the surgery			2
father - of - three mr @entity23 said : ' there ’s been an awful lot of research lately regarding stem cells and how to deliver them and use them to cure diseases , leukaemia , diabetes and cancers			1
we had been looking for a way to store stem cells when @entity86 was born			2
we ’d heard all about it and thought it was a good idea			2
' although there ’s not a lot of treatments just now , we knew there was a future in it , in personalised bio-technology , where everybody cures themselves			0
it ’s a fabulous service to be able to offer your children			0
we explained the relevance of it , why we were going to take her tooth and she was a brilliant patient			0
' it ’s always a little bit nerve - wracking treating members of your family or your friends			0
you feel a great deal of empathy with them , as you do with all your patients , but more so with people you know			0
' mrs @entity11 , who works as an administrator for the surgery , said : ' i knew i wanted to keep her teeth to bank them because with the progress that science has made now , and the things that stem cells can do at the moment , who knows what it ’s going to be like in 10 years , 20 or 30 years			1
' it ’s such a gift to be able to give your child			0
we told her that inside her tooth there are cells and they ’ll go underground in a big freezer , and if ever she needs an operation or if something happens , her cells are there to make her better			0
' the only thing she was worried about was the tooth fairy			0

@entity143 removed his *healthy* daughter *'s* wobbly front teeth as an *experiment* , after finding out they were a good source of stem cells
cells from the dental pulp will be frozen and stored for 30 years or more
mr @entity23 believes cells could be used in the future to help cure his daughter if she falls ill
