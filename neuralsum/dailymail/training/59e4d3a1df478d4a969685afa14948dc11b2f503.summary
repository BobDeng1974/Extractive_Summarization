he has now been given six months to pay the money back or face another six years in prison			2

' he does not regard imprisonment so much as an occupational hazard as a necessary part of the work to be done to obtain money from his crimes , albeit paid in arrears			0
' i have regard to his history of criminality , his use of his mother ’s accounts to conceal the financial realities , to sham property transactions , to the known existence of the @entity60 bank account and to his failure to provide any information about it			0
' i find it inherently improbable this man would not commit offences without making very large profits			0
the likelihood is that he took large fees for concealing the assets of other criminals and that he has hidden them or their proceeds			0
' @entity73 was told how the former property dealer - who drove a @entity75 and lived in a five bedroom house on a private estate in rural @entity79 - advertised his services via a website and in prison newspapers			0

@entity4 would then double the genuine firm 's quoted price , submit a legal aid claim to the @entity92 , and pocket the difference himself			1
guilty : the website @entity4 used to advertise his services before he was jailed for eight and a half years after admitting 15 counts of fraud the court was also told how the @entity99 used ' cultural pressure ' to make his daughter @entity101 participate in his scheming , having her join a lawyers ' association and network with defence solicitors and barristers at trade functions			1

the court heard how @entity4 billed one 74 - year - old client facing confiscation proceedings for money laundering £ 43,000			1
he should have been charged just £ 10,000			2
the money was recouped by the @entity138 through legal aid at the expense of the taxpayer			0
@entity4 was sentenced to eight and a half years in prison after pleading guilty to 15 counts of fraud			1
@entity101 , who admitted four counts of fraud , was given a 12 - month prison sentence , suspended for 18 months , and ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work			0
passing sentence , judge @entity37 told @entity150 : ' your plan from the beginning was that this business would be a vehicle for fraud			2
' you are a determined and persistent and versatile professional criminal			0
what you did was intended to undermine the whole legal process			0
' detective superintendent @entity159 from the @entity120 said : ' @entity4 was a ruthless serial fraudster who was prepared to use his own daughter to steal from a wide range of individuals for his own gain			2
luxury : @entity4 lived in a five - bedroomed home on a rural private estate in @entity79 and drove a @entity75 coupe ' cheating the taxpayer is not a victimless crime especially in these difficult times - yet this man has shown little remorse			1
' @entity174 , chief executive of the @entity92 , said : ' legal aid funding is public money and we will not tolerate people trying to defraud the taxpayer			0
' @entity4 has previously served time in jail for his part in smuggling amphetamine ' pill - making ' machines into @entity184 from @entity185 during the 1990s			2
in a later scam he sent letters to companies up and down the country offering to register them under the then new @entity191 , and warning them that they could be prosecuted if they did not pay up			0
the firms were charged a fee of £ 135 for @entity4 's ' service ' , when the true cost of registering was £ 35			1
he was jailed for four years in december 2004 and ordered to pay back almost £ 500,000			1
it was upon his release from prison that @entity4 set up his shady legal advice firm @entity122 detective chief inspector @entity204 , head of the @entity205 said : ' @entity4 was a ruthless and serial fraudster who was prepared to use his daughter to steal from a wide range of people for his own gain			2
it was clear he was making a large profit by abusing the legal aid system			0
