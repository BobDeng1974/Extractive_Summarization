by @entity0 dramatic : the chances of @entity3 leaving the @entity4 rose last night after it emerged that one of @entity9 's closest @entity8 allies @entity10 , pictured , believes it is time to tell @entity12 ' we are ready to quit ' the chances of @entity3 leaving the @entity4 rose dramatically last night after it emerged that one of @entity9 ’s closest @entity8 allies believes it is time to tell @entity12 bluntly : ‘ we are ready to quit			1
’ education secretary @entity10 has told friends that , if there was a referendum today on whether the @entity3 should cut its ties with @entity12 , he would vote to leave			1
he wants @entity3 to give other @entity4 nations an ultimatum : ‘ give us back our sovereignty or we will walk out			1
’ mr @entity10 insists the @entity3 could thrive as a free trading nation on its own , like other @entity29 nations in @entity30 such as @entity31 and @entity32			1
he has changed his view partly as a result of his fury at @entity12 meddling which has held up his school reforms			0
mr @entity10 , one of the prime minister ’s closest confidants , has discussed his views in detail with mr @entity9			1
in an anti-eu pincer movement by the two @entity44 allies , mr @entity9 will formally announce later this month the first major step towards grabbing back powers from @entity12			2
he will set out in detail how he plans to withdraw @entity3 from @entity4 justice ties , but he will then ‘ cherry pick ’ which aspects of @entity4 legal co-operation he believes are in @entity3 interests			1
these could include the @entity54 ( @entity54 ) , access to police databases , prisoner transfers and co-operation over drugs trafficking and money laundering			0
the disclosures are the latest evidence of a turning point in @entity3 ’s relationship with the @entity4 , which is currently gripped by the euro crisis			0
mr @entity9 has struck an increasingly tough stance			0
he won plaudits for vetoing changes in the @entity69 , has edged closer to pledging an ‘ in or out ’ referendum , and suggested @entity12 should have two budgets , one for eurozone nations and another for non-eurozone nations such as the @entity3			1
mr @entity10 , backed by eurosceptic ministers including welfare secretary @entity75 and environment secretary @entity76 , wants mr @entity9 to go even further			2
a well - placed source said : ‘ countless @entity3 prime ministers have said they want to reclaim powers over justice , fishing , employment , health and safety and other matters from the @entity4			0
‘ but when people like @entity87 and @entity88 say to them , “ what if they refuse ? have you got the courage to tell them you are packing your bags and leaving ? ” they always reply feebly , “ @entity97 , no , we wo n’t			0
” wants out : mr @entity10 has told friends that , if there was a referendum today on whether the @entity3 should cut its ties with @entity12 , he would vote to leave ‘ @entity10 thinks it is about time we spelled it out , in simple words that even @entity12 bureaucrats can understand , that we wo n’t tolerate this any longer			1
we have to tell them if they do n’t return some of the important powers they have snaffled from us , we will leave			0
we have nothing to be scared of and he wants them to know that			0
‘ we are a major trading nation and that gives us considerable bargaining power with the @entity4 whether we leave – or stay in			1
’ last night , @entity44 grandee @entity118 , chairman of the @entity119 and a long - time @entity4 critic , said : ‘ the significance of the change in @entity10 ’s attitude can not be overstated			2
‘ no one is closer to @entity9 and @entity10 clearly now agrees with people like me who have been arguing for years that we should be prepared to leave the @entity4 if they do not agree to a substantial renegotiation of our terms of membership			1
’ mr @entity10 ’s view on @entity30 has changed so dramatically that he has spoken admiringly of arch @entity132 mp @entity131			2
for years , mr @entity131 has been derided by mainstream conservatives as an extremist			0
but mr @entity10 observed : ‘ maybe @entity131 was right all along			2
’ getting tough : mr @entity10 , one of the prime minister 's closest confidants , has discussed his views in detail with mr @entity9 , pictured the education secretary is among a number of @entity44 ministers who say they have been shocked to discover the extent of @entity12 ’ power to interfere in @entity3 legislation			1
officials say several aspects of mr @entity10 ’s school reforms have been ‘ disrupted ’ by the @entity4 and the @entity148			1
they claim his plan to make it easier for the bosses of failing schools to get rid of sub-standard teachers have been affected by an @entity4 anti-sacking law			0
mr @entity10 has also been told moves to give teachers greater power to discipline pupils could fall foul of the @entity148			2
and plans to streamline the process for building new schools and classrooms have been delayed by complex @entity4 laws on procurement which are said to be ‘ pro big business ’ , making it impossible for local building firms to win contracts			0
the increasingly @entity170 mood of mr @entity9 and fellow senior ministers is certain to place further strains on relations with @entity175 deputy prime minister @entity174			0
cynics will say it also reflects the electoral threat to the @entity178 posed by the fiercely anti-eu @entity179			0
more than 100 @entity44 mps this year called on mr @entity9 to take @entity3 out of the @entity54 , on the grounds that it infringes @entity3 sovereignty and takes little account of widely varying standards of procedural fairness across @entity30			2
by withdrawing from @entity4 justice ties , mr @entity9 will have to exempt the @entity3 from all 130 arrangements with @entity12 that concern home affairs			1
@entity190 will then negotiate over which measures to opt back into – and on terms more acceptable to @entity170 backbenchers .			0

@entity194 has told friends that he would vote to leave if there was a referendum today on whether the @entity3 should cut its ties with @entity12
he wants @entity3 to give other @entity4 nations an ultimatum : ‘ give us back our sovereignty or we will walk out ’
mr @entity10 insists the @entity3 could thrive as a free trading nation on its own like @entity31 and @entity32
