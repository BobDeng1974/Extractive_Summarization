january was the month for drastic action			1
twice as many people as last year — 40,000 — signed up to a campaign organised by @entity3 and gave up booze			1
another 50,000 did the same via @entity5			1
every woman i know has bought a juicer , is on a diet or has started some brutal new form of exercise or other			1
our prime minister is running every other day to get rid of his festive flab			1
even @entity15 has signed up for punishing ‘ hot yoga ’ classes in @entity17 given by an extraordinary - looking chap with dreadlocks			1
but exercising , giving up carbs and shunning fast food and booze is n’t enough for some folk : according to people who monitor trends , the hottest form of self - improvement in 2015 involves stripping away non-essential clutter from our lives , and living with just the bare essentials instead			1
@entity32 took on board the advice given by @entity35 in his new book ' @entity37 ' with some interesting results devotees have been dubbed ‘ experientalists ’ — a horrible word which describes the knack of living through real experiences rather than accumu - lated possessions			1
a book entitled @entity37 , @entity46 , by @entity35 — an author and ‘ trend forecaster ’ — has just been published , and has attracted a lot of attention			1
mr @entity35 is an evangelist for this new lifestyle , claiming we will be happier and healthier if we bought less , chucked out or sold the stuff we never use , and spent our time enjoying life through doing things , either alone or with friends and family , rather than wielding our credit cards			1
@entity35 claims not to be anti-consumerism , but advises that before every purchase , we must ask ourselves ‘ do i really need this ? will it make me happy or just bring debt and depression ? ’ — presumably when we ca n’t pay the bill			1
a book entitled @entity37 , @entity46 , by @entity35 , an author and ‘ trend forecaster ’ has attracted a lot of attention recently he wants us to monitor our wardrobes every month and eliminate everything we have n’t worn			1
he ’s very keen on expressions like focusing our minds ‘ in the zone ’			1
this ‘ zone ’ means living in the present , enjoying whatever activity you are doing to the full			1
opting for adventure over repetition			1
doing new things and enjoying new experiences , instead of just shopping			1
travelling and broadening our horizons , learning new skills , instead of addictively purchasing stuff we do n’t need			1
@entity35 says there ’s no such thing as retail therapy , advocating that we only purchase stuff we can use to achieve a life - enhancing goal , like a bicycle or a guitar			1
he reckons we ’ve all accumulated so much detritus that it is suffocating us , hence the title of the book			1
in fact , the ‘ living - with-less ’ movement has been gathering steam for some time			1
it started in the @entity100 and @entity101 , particularly among those who worked in the new tech industries , who believed that modern technology meant it was possible to live with much less stuff			1
these minimalists give away or trade all their possessions , apart from laptops , @entity110 , @entity111 , a few items of clothing , and a mattress , and live in small rented flats			1
hardcore minimalists — called @entity117 — say things like ‘ the internet has replaced my need for an address ’ and carry their belongings around in a backpack , sleeping on friends ’ sofas			1
they claim that all they need is a hard drive and a change of pants			2
one man , @entity131 , even wrote a book entitled @entity133 , subtitled how i got rid of almost everything , @entity135			2
sounds tempting , does n’t it ? achieving happiness through consciously chucking out or flogging off what we no longer need			2
going for the simpler ( and cheaper ) life			2
let ’s face it , giving up booze , bread and bacon is a lot easier than giving up internet shopping			2
how many times have i come in late from supper , sat down at the laptop and bingo ! bought a frock that will never go over my backside , a swimming costume that would fit an elf , a full set of dvds i will never watch , or a floor - polishing machine than has never left the box because the instructions are incomprehensible			2
i ’m a typical shopper , believing that every purchase is essential			2
consumerism is worse than obesity , in its own way			2
it ’s led the country to massive debt and depression			2
survey after survey shows just how much unused stuff is clogging up our homes : women own an average of 25 pairs of shoes , five of which never get worn			2
they just sit in the cupboard looking sad			2
' @entity117 ' in the @entity100 and @entity101 , believed that modern technology meant it was possible to live with much less stuff			2
these minimalists give away all their possessions , apart from laptops , @entity110 , @entity111 , a few items of clothing , and a mattress , and live in small rented flats two - thirds of us own kitchen gadgets that have only ever been used six times , and one in ten of all the items in our kitchens has never been used			1
from sandwich makers to slow cookers , these so - called ‘ aids ’ are just dust - collectors			2
when it comes to clothes , women have ( on average ) 22 items each they never wear , valued at almost £ 300 per person			1
men are no better , hanging on to 19 items of clothing they ’ve never worn			1
we buy clothes that do n’t fit — and then delude ourselves that we will ‘ slim ’ into them			2
we waste money on impulse buys , and then kid ourselves they are being saved for a ‘ special ’ occasion			2
i bought an expensive silk dress because i liked the fabric , then had it altered because it made me look fat , and have never worn it because i still feel chubby in it			0
to be honest , that dress was cursed , it carried a death wish			0
now , i ’ve recycled it to a charity shop			0
every time we buy clothes , we naively hope they possess magic properties — and will make us happier , look gorgeous , attract compliments , draw attractive people in our direction , and generally impart a feeling of well - being			1
no dress can do that , particularly one bought in a hurry or after a big lunch			0
a dress is a dress , it can only do so much — especially if you ’re over 60 and a size 14			0
@entity32 says she does n't think editing her life down to 100 items is n't realistic as she 'd hate to give up her childhood toys like her @entity249 doll the same false hopes and dreams apply to 99 per cent of my purchases , from brightly coloured sofas that turn out to be uncomfortable ( but look so trendy ) to self - improving books i never read — bought because the reviewer gave them five stars			1
so can i adopt this new minimalist mantra and avoid being suffocated by my stuff ? at 68 , i have certainly built up a sizeable collection , but i ’m not sure i can be ruthless			0
i ’ve got the living room down to the bare minimum — one sofa , one table , six chairs , no rug			0
then my partner bought a cactus			0
then he added another one			0
they ruin my pristine environment , the plant equivalent of a shedding dog , sitting in nasty saucers			0
my architect - designed kitchen is pretty lean and mean , but i forgot to specify a space for a bin , so a free - standing one ruins the whole effect , especially when an unsightly plastic bag pokes out of the top			0
my minimalism really goes to pot when you open a cupboard door in the bedroom			0
there ’s not even room for one more dress			0
the wardrobes and shelves for sweaters and t - shirts are crammed			0
i went through the whole summer thinking i had no clothes ( so i bought a couple of frocks ) and then in november found all my much - loved old summer dresses packed in a suitcase in the boiler room			0
if i had to chuck out what i never wear — at gunpoint — i could run three charity shops for a week			1
as it is , i drop off two carrier - bag loads every other saturday			0
this trait runs in the family , because when my mum died , i took 40 bags of mostly unworn clothes , still in their carrier bags ( largely purchased by me because she was always moaning she never had anything to wear ) to the charity shops of @entity315			0
i have shoes i ’ve never worn , like my purple suede @entity319 brogues — a size too big			0
i ’ve got a pink sequined cardigan that makes me look like a big fat fairy			0
there ’s a halterneck black chiffon evening dress that shows every under - arm wrinkle			0
if i can purge my wardrobe of half its contents , then i will be happier , just as mr @entity35 predicts , but when i enter my office , it ’s another matter			0
filing cabinets and cupboards are full to bursting with more than 50 photo albums , half a century of diaries and notebooks , detailing every walk i ’ve ever done			0
there are folders of all my love - letters , all my wedding and divorce certificates			0
i ’ve kept my school swimming certificates , my life - saving medal , and my little award for growing a daffodil in the @entity346			0
i could never get rid of this ‘ stuff ’ — because it connects me to my past , reminds me how far i ’ve come			0
it brings back memories of happy times and sad deaths			0
the idea of editing my entire life down to 100 items like the disciples of minimalism has suddenly hit the buffers			1
unless one whole filing cabinet containing a lifetime of memories could be considered a single object			0
and what about my treasured @entity366 toy , who has come everywhere with me for years , and who sits by my computer cheering me up ? or my @entity249 doll and @entity371 , purchased in the village jumble sale for £ 2 ages ago ? little objects that are worth their weight in gold			0
in my head i ’m a minimalist , but when it comes to my heart , it ’s another matter			0
@entity37 : @entity46 , by @entity35 ( @entity384 , £ 9.99 )			0

for many , january is a time to start a new diet , *re-vamp* your wardobe and chuck out all the *rubbish* you never use
some people take it to a whole new level and refine their possessions down to 100 key items
@entity32 gives it a go before *deciding* , maybe this is n't for her !
