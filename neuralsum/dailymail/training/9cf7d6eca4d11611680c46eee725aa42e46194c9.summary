scroll down for highlights teeing off : @entity7 had to start his round without a driver after giving away his preferred club up and down : the @entity26 endured a mixed round , eventually finishing on level par video @entity29 : first @entity31 highlights ' i had three drivers in my bag after yesterday			1
there were a couple of drivers made up for a couple of my caddie 's friends			0
' two were taken out and given to these two gentlemen and one was left in my golf bag			1
it just was the wrong one			0
' this morning when i picked up my bag there was a driver in the wrong spot			1
i picked it up and realised that 's not my shaft			2
' that club should have been given to someone else and mine was actually given to that person and driven down to @entity54			2
' fortunately it did n't affect the game plan			0

i tried to force the 2 - iron a couple of times when i should have hit 3 - wood or driver			2

it 's a platform for which i can build for the rest of the week			0
