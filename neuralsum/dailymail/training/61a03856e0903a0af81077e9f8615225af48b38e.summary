@entity1 co-host @entity0 has defended his on - air argument with a @entity4 columnist branding those who argue @entity6 are not doing anything to combat extremism as ' ignorant '			1
@entity0 and @entity9 went head - to - head on monday morning over the role of @entity12 in the recent @entity14 terror attacks			1
@entity9 told the @entity16 breakfast show that @entity6 should ' start discussing intelligently and meaningfully ' the links between their community and @entity20 extremists - including @entity21			1
the discussion between @entity9 , @entity0 , his co-host @entity22 and @entity24 's @entity23 then became clearly heated when @entity0 claimed @entity6 were no more responsible for the actions of @entity20 extremists than @entity28 were for attacks carried out by fundamentalists			1
@entity0 went on to cite attacks on abortion clinics and the @entity34 massacre carried out by @entity35 as examples of terror that were not more broadly linked to @entity38 - and at one point produced his phone to help prove his point			2
the @entity1 co-host stood his ground on monday afternoon , while acknowledging that the issue was not about taking sides but about peace			2
' let me make it very clear … i in no way support the acts of unspeakable terror perpetrated by @entity20 extremists			1
or any other acts of violent extremism perpetrated falsely in the name of any @entity56			0
this is not a matter of taking sides …			0
it 's about standing up for peace , ' @entity0 told @entity62			2
check out the work of @entity80 , or @entity81 , or @entity82 , or the mufti himself			0
' to pretend that @entity6 are not engaged in the debate about extremism is just ignorant			2
@entity77 's @entity20 leaders have been vocal about @entity21 , about @entity86 , and about @entity14 , condemning those acts as crimes against @entity12 and humanity , and talking about the kinds of actions @entity77 's @entity6 are undertaking at the grassroots to combat extremism			1
' to claim that they need to " step up " ignores the fact that they 're stepping up already			0
' how heartbreaking it must be to constantly defend your religion against the actions of those who seek to misuse it for evil , ' the co-host said			0
@entity9 also stood by her comments , but admitted she was ' taken aback ' by the fierce turn the conversation took			0
' i think @entity0 inadvertently proved the point that i was making in the article which is this eagerness to make excuses , ' she told @entity62			0
the columnist also said her words were misinterpreted adding : ' what @entity0 was claiming i was saying i was n't actually saying ... i 'm not seeking the blame the greater community for the claims of the extremists			2
' @entity0 and @entity9 ( pictured ) passionately argued over whether @entity12 was the only religion to have people commit acts of terror while the debate was ongoing co-host @entity22 ( left in left image ) kept quiet as did other guest @entity23 ( bottom right ) @entity9 said @entity0 's argument that many members of other religions committing ' such atrocities ' was irrelevant as ' it 's 2015 and @entity12 falls at the centre			1
' ' there 's no point worrying about what happened 300 years ago even 30 years ago , ' she said adding that it was important to recognise what is happening now			0
' we need to start discussing intelligently and meaningfully the issues we have with the @entity139 , ' @entity9 began in the @entity1 segment , citing the angle she took in an article published on monday morning			0
the columnist continued by saying that a discussion needs to be ignited about why such acts of terror are occurring , adding ' they quite clearly have everything to do with @entity12 '			0
@entity9 then asked : ' what can we do to bring the @entity20 community into the mainstream even more ' before @entity0 cut her off			1
at one point @entity0 took out this phone to look up an answer to one of @entity9 's questions and prove his point ' but we 're already discussing this - we 've been discussing it for a long time @entity9 and every time a bunch of fundamentalist @entity28 in the @entity161 bomb an abortion clinic or bomb a synagogue do we hold every @entity28 in the world to account for that ? ' @entity0 argued			2
@entity9 deemed his argument ' nonsensical ' before @entity0 then accused his guest of ' holding the majority responsible for the actions of a very small minority '			2
she argued that she was not doing that , and insisted that it was time to stop pretending @entity12 was like any other religion , suggesting instead that it was the only such one at the centre of any act of terror around the world			0
while this debate was raging co-host @entity22 did n't say a word while the other guest @entity23 sat looking rather amused at the conversation			1
@entity9 and @entity0 continued the debate about what classified an act of terror with @entity0 firmly standing his ground over the fact that not only @entity6 were committing such acts , again referencing the bombing of abortion clinics in @entity161			1
at many stages during the debate @entity0 cut off @entity9 when asked by @entity9 when the last time such an event took place the @entity1 co-host admitted ' off the top of his head ' he was n't sure but vowed to find out picking up his phone to search online			1
@entity23 was eventually bought into the conversation and described the issue as ' very emotional ' before declaring ' i 've got to say , i 'm in the @entity0 camp			1
' ' where was this conversation when the @entity207 were bombing @entity208 and parts if @entity210 on the basis of their catholic religion ? ' the radio host asked			0
' it think it 's very very easy to marginalise @entity6 because people do n't understand the religion ... and it 's too easy to marginalise them when you 've got the prime minister of @entity77 saying he finds the burqa " very confronting " , ' @entity23 added			2
@entity9 then weighed back in asking her fellow guest if he found that burqa confronting to which he said ' @entity9 i do n't find it confronting in any way shape or form			1
' i ’m not that narrow - minded , ' @entity23 added			1
@entity9 asked @entity23 if he found the burqa confronting , to which he replied he did n't and he was not that narrow - minded the conversation wrapped up with @entity0 stating that the last attack on an abortion clinic was in 2009 as co-host @entity22 tried to finish up the segment			1
since the heated debate @entity233 has been alight with conversation about the discussion , with viewers weighing in passionately on both sides			0
even @entity9 tried to keep the conversation going , tweeting about the exchange following her appearance			0
' interesting discussion on @ sunriseon7 according to @entity12 extremists are no bigger problem than extremes of others religions , ' she wrote			0
it 's that type of wilful blindness that has categorised the debate thus far ' , @entity9 said in another post .			0
