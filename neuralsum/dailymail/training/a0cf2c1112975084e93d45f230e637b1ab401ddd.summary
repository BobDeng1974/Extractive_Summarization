by @entity0 a top @entity2 skier was hit by a baby elk after it smashed through his window together with entrails when the car hit its pregnant mother as he drove in @entity9 in northern @entity10			1
@entity12 said : ' i had just come over a hill and the sun was shining directly in my eyes , i only saw the elk when it was a few metres away and it was standing right in the middle - of - the - road			1
' it hit the front of the car and then smashed into the windscreen and then the body of the elk went tumbling over the roof			2
i was completely covered in glass and the elk 's innards			2
' @entity12 's car was badly damaged when an elk ran out in front of his car in @entity9 , @entity10 the heavily pregnant elk smashed the bonnet , windscreen and roof , losing its stomach contents during the impact moments after the horrific smash , mr @entity12 noticed the elk calf in the passenger 's seat , still attached to its mother by its umbilical cord miraculously the calf was still alive despite the trauma of the impact the 25 - year - old said that there was so much blood he was convinced he had been badly cut somewhere and had rushed to check himself , but found only a small cut on his hand			1
the elk however was dead			0
he said that he had not wanted to look too closely at the bloody mess inside the car but when the pick - up truck arrived to remove the wreckage and remove the body , he said he needed to go inside the vehicle to get some documents from the glove compartment			0
he said : ' i was about to grab some things from my glove compartment but when i opened the car door , i was shocked to see the was a little baby elk laying there and it was alive			2
the umbilical cord was still attached			0
i was so shocked that i slammed the door again			0
' i thought to myself , did i really see what i think i saw ? ' a friend of his arrived seconds later and he decided to check again realised it was an elk calf and it was alive			1
they realised that @entity12 had n't noticed the calf in the immediate aftermath of the crash , which he attributed in part to being in shock and in part to the car 's interior being completely covered in guts and glass			1
when the mother elk collided with the car , her stomach contents had emptied into the car , including her unborn calf			2
he added : ' people do n't believe me when i tell them what happened , they think it 's the weirdest thing they 've ever heard			0
but i just show them the pictures			0
' he called the police , who in turn called in a wildlife expert who decided that the calf would not survive without its mother and killed it			0
. mr @entity12 added : ' it 's a tragedy of course , and i wish i could say the elk survived too			1
but i 'm just happy i 'm alive , and so grateful to all the people who helped			0
' mr @entity12 said that he wished the calf could have been saved but he was lucky to have been alive himself following the crash mr @entity12 said people do n't believe him about what happened , until he shows them the photographs			1

@entity12 was blinded by the sun seconds before the collision
his car struck the pregnant elk which *forced* out the calf which shot through the windscreen
despite the impact , the calf was still alive but was later put down
mr @entity12 said he was struck by the calf and its mother 's entrails as they entered the car
