@entity0 are cheering over @entity3 speaker @entity2 's decision to dig in his heels by not compromising with president @entity5 over the mandated $ 85billion in spending cuts			1
because no deal was reached , the president had to order the beginning of the drastic sequester , forcing federal agencies to cut billions in accordance with a dramatic way to cut down the deficit			1
though his blatant show of partisanship may strike some as callous , it is winning him a lot of points from conservative members of his party who previously felt that they were being ignored			0
' i get the feeling that our party is probably more unified right now than it has been at any time in the last several months			0
' at the beginning of the year , mr @entity2 was not the most popular man in his party and there were even rumblings that he may be unseated			1
the tides have clearly shifted as he leans in towards the right of his base			0
' we asked him to commit to us that when the cuts actually came on march 1 , that he would stand firm and not give in , and he ’s holding to that , ' conservative @entity0 @entity53 told the paper			1
' i think friday will be an important day that shows we ’re finally willing to stand and fight for conservative principles and force @entity57 to start living within its means			2
and that will be a big victory			0
' conservative support : @entity0 representatives @entity53 ( left ) and @entity33 ( right ) both lauded @entity2 's actions saying that he is playing tough and honoring @entity0 principles headed in without hope : @entity2 agreed to nothing during the last - ditch negotiation session mr @entity2 has also won himself a big - name fan in @entity70 , but his support comes more at mr @entity5 's expense rather than as a result of mr @entity2 's tactics			1
' well , no one can think that that 's been a success for the president , ' the former presidential candidate said in his first post-campaign interview with @entity81			2
' he did n't think the sequester would happen			2
it is happening , but to date , what we 've seen is the president out campaigning to the @entity88 people , doing rallies around the country , flying around the country and berating @entity0 and blaming and pointing			1
that causes the @entity0 to retrench and to put up a wall and to fight back			1
it 's a very natural human emotion			0
' the president has the opportunity to lead the nation and to bring @entity0 and @entity99 together			1
it 's a job he 's got to do , and it 's a job only the president can do			2
' president @entity5 officially signed off on the $ 85billion in spending cuts on friday night after congressional leaders fail to compromise on a replacement deal , leaving thousands of @entity88 in fear for their jobs			1
sharing his thoughts : former presidential candidate @entity70 said that the sequester is not a good move for president @entity5 and he blamed his former opponent for ' forcing ' republicans to dig in their heels the letter was formally sent to mr @entity2 at 9pm on friday night and was welcomed by no one involved , as both the @entity0 and @entity99 agree that it is a bad deal that can drastically damage the country 's economy but neither are willing to give in			1
' @entity120 sequestration is a blunt and indiscriminate instrument			0
it was never intended to be implemented and does not represent a responsible way for our nation to achieve deficit reduction , ' the formal letter kicking off the seven months of spending cuts reads			1
the president made his displeasure with the deal known in a formal statement from the pres briefing room			2
' starting tomorrow , everybody here , all the folks who are cleaning the floors at the @entity135 … they 're going to have less pay , the janitors , the security guards			0
they just got a pay cut , and they got to figure out how to manage that , ' @entity5 said			2
' that 's real ... that 's not a scare tactic			0
' @entity5 made the remarks from the @entity3 following a meeting with @entity3 speaker @entity2 and @entity151 minority leader @entity150 , as well as @entity99 leaders @entity152 and @entity154			1
@entity2 emerged from the meeting and told reporters that taxes were off the table as an option to avoid the spending cuts , making it clear that no compromise had been made			1
house speaker @entity2 emerged from a @entity3 meeting and declared that taxes are off the table as an option to avoid thesequester cuts ' the discussion about revenue , in my view , is over , ' he said			1
' it 's about taking on the spending problem			2
' in an interview with @entity175 later in the day , @entity2 said he never really saw a path forward that avoided the sequester			1
' if i did , that meeting at the @entity3 today might have gone better , ' he said			2
' the sequestration is a blunt and indiscriminate instrument			0
it was never intended to be implemented ' - @entity183 @entity5 blamed @entity0 for the country 's predicament , claiming that there are many conservatives on @entity188 who agree with him , but are unwilling to say so publicly			1
' we just need republicans in @entity31 to catch up with their own party and the country on this , ' he said			0
president @entity5 wanted to replace the so - called sequester with a plan that would raise revenues as well as make a series of targeted spending cuts			1
but after making concessions on taxes in december by raising rates on the wealthiest of @entity88 , republicans said they were unwilling to include new revenues in a plan to avert the sequester			2
asked why @entity31 was not even in session on the sequestration deadline day , @entity5 snarled that he could not employ a ' @entity209 mind meld ' to force cooperation between lawmakers			2
' i 'm not a dictator , ' he said			0
' i 'm the president			0
' the immediate impact of the reductions remains uncertain , even as @entity5 has declared it would mean ' hundreds of thousands of jobs lost			1
' the administration has pulled back on earlier warnings of long lines developing quickly at airports and teacher layoffs affecting classrooms			0
because of those claims , @entity5 has been accused of posturing and exaggerating the effects of the cuts			1
his warnings of economic doom appeared to be a partial attempt to avert blame in the future if the economy begins to contract			0
' every time that we get a piece of economic news over the next month , two months or six months ... we 'll know that that economic news could have been better if @entity31 had not failed to act , ' he said			0
' i do n't anticipate a huge financial crisis , but people are going to be hurt			0
the economy will not grow as quickly as it would have , unemployment will not go down as quickly as it would have , ' @entity5 said industries most affected by the cuts will be those that rely heavily on government funding , including the military and defense contractors			1
' communities near military bases will take a serious blow , ' @entity5 said			2
' border patrol agents , @entity254 agents ... all will suffer significant pay cuts and furloughs			0
' while @entity5 warned off mass layoffs and smaller salaries as an immediate result of the cuts , he also hedged his warnings , saying , ' this is not going to be an apocalypse ... it 's just dumb			1
' he urged @entity31 to continue working on a plan to eventually replace the sequester			0
' i do n't anticipate a huge financial crisis , but people are going to be hurt , he said			0
' the economy will not grow as quickly as it would have , unemployment will not go down as quickly as it would have			0

he reiterated that tax increases were off the table			0
' i want to make clear that any solutions will be done through the regular order , with input from both sides of the aisle in public debate , ' he said			0
' i will not be part of any back - room deal and i will absolutely not agree to increase taxes			0
' the meeting at the @entity3 between @entity5 and congressional leaders , which lasted just under an hour , ended around 11:10 a.m. no breakthrough was expected to come out of the talks			1

on the @entity151 floor thursday , a @entity0 proposal requiring @entity5 to propose alternative cuts that would cause less disruption in essential government services fell to overwhelming @entity99 opposition , 62 - 38			1
moments later , a @entity99 alternative to spread the cuts over a decade and replace half with higher taxes on millionaires and corporations won a bare majority , 51 - 49 , but that was well shy of the 60 needed to advance			2
