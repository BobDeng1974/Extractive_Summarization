by @entity0 published : 04:53 est , 22 march 2013 updated : 04:58 est , 22 march 2013 it 's gone : @entity4 opening ceremony mastermind @entity2 says that good feelings that swept across @entity6 in @entity7 are dead @entity4 opening ceremony architect @entity2 has declared the feel - good factor that spread across @entity6 because of @entity7 is dead			1
the @entity11 ' creative director believes the positive spirit has been crushed by economic gloom			1
mr @entity2 , who was roundly praised for his work in masterminding @entity16 's £ 27 million @entity4 opening ceremony , said he felt the positive impact of the @entity11 before they started and after they ended			1
but he said the public has returned to their ' private battles ' , adding that it was ' naive ' to hope the optimism of the @entity11 would continue			1
' i think it would be naive to say it could last , ' he told @entity28 ' it 's nice to have a filip like that to feel good together , then you get back to your private battles			1
' obviously we are in tough economic times which means it is difficult finding jobs for people			2
' @entity2 turned down a knighthood for his work saying ' it ’s just not me ' despite being touted for the @entity43 list for creating the highly praised spectacle			2
he said he would not have felt right accepting an individual award as a cast of thousands - including the @entity47 - helped create it			0
thanks but no thanks : mr @entity2 , 56 , was in line for the @entity43 list for the highly praised event at the @entity53 but turned it down ' it ’s just not me			0
i also thought it was wrong , actually , ' he told the @entity58			0
' you can make these speeches about " this is everybody ’s work , blah blah blah "			0
' and you ’ve got to mean it , and i did mean it , and it is true , and it ’s the only way you can carry on something like that : through the efforts of all the people			0
' i do n’t know whether i ’ll ever get invited back to the @entity71			2
' he and his artistic team sent a ' script ' to @entity71			0
it was in the hope @entity47 would agree to a surprise appearance in the much loved @entity80 skit , which saw her accompanied to the @entity11 by @entity6 ’s top secret agent			1
memorable : a performer playing the @entity47 parachutes from a helicopter during the opening ceremony of the @entity7 @entity6 : actors perform in a sequence to represent the @entity89 ( @entity89 ) during the ceremony , which was roundly praised the unexpected scene was one of the quirky highlights of the ceremony			1
he said : ' basically we thought there are two scenarios			0
' they ’ll either agree , provided we do it with a good double ( and we promised them that we ’d either get a really good actor , a @entity105 - style actor , or we ’d get a cracking double , so it was n’t poking fun ) , or it will be a no. '			0

' i think it would be naive to say it could last , ' @entity11 ' creative director said
