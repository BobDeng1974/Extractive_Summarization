it was three decades since they last appeared on stage together , and tickets cost upwards of £ 75 a head , but the @entity7 crew had no trouble packing the @entity9 with fans last night			1
@entity11 ( mostly ) - so named because one of the original group , @entity14 , died 25 years ago - was organised , as the septuagenarian comedians happily admitted , to ' make a lot of money ' for them			1
@entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 performed most of the old favourites , from the @entity25 to a singalong of @entity27 looks on the @entity28 , and many of the diehard fans turned up in @entity7 fancy dress			1
critics - many of whom definitely remembered the jokes from the first time around - mostly raved about it , but many fans took to @entity36 to complain about what one called ' @entity7 's @entity38 '			1
' twitter user @entity58 wrote : ' i do n't care what people think but @entity7 are s * * * *			1
it 's just a bunch of skint old men trying to make a few quid			1
' @entity65 wrote of last night 's opening show in a run of ten : ' am i alone in thinking the reformed @entity7 shows are n't quite as madcap , offbeat , and rib - ticklingly funny as is being made out ? ' and an @entity72 writer said the ageing comedians had ' made a hefty withdrawal from their reputation bank ' , adding ' there were , predictably , dead parrots			1
' @entity78 has called the surviving @entity79 ' a bunch of wrinkly old men trying to relive their youth ' , while @entity84 's @entity83 ( see below for full review ) went even further , saying : ' five tuxedo 'd old geezers , necks like tortoises , creaked and croaked through a patchy night of their greatest hits			1
do n't hold back : writing on @entity36 , @entity58 referred to the comedians ' desire to make more money @entity21 , 71 , was described by mail critic @entity83 as the ' busiest and most enthusiastic ' of the @entity79 cutting to the chase : this @entity36 user referred to the comedians ' admission they needed more money ' once they were the sharpest thing in satire			1
last night , quite often , they looked and sounded like a dodgy tribute band			1
' he described @entity19 as ' all implausible teeth and pot belly ' , while @entity22 , who was ' wearing one of those irritating ponytails old groovers of a certain era like to sport , ' seemed barely gripped by proceedings			1
' the @entity113 said the show 's appeal lay in the fact that there was nothing new			0
' it 's not something completely different but that 's exactly why fans will love it , ' said @entity124 , whose only criticism was not seeing enough of the @entity79 onstage compared with the dancers			0
the @entity128 understood that the comedians , who range in age from 74 ( @entity19 ) to 71 ( @entity21 and @entity20 ) , needed time to ' recover from their exertions '			1
how they were : from left , @entity21 , @entity23 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity22 , and @entity14 who died in 1989 enthusiastic review : the @entity36 verdict was n't all bad - this fan said last night 's show was ' amazing ' the way they were : the dead parrot sketch , originally aired in 1969 , was brought back to life at the @entity9 ' it 's a tall order for a bunch of old men and i think we can cut them some slack , ' writes @entity149 , who said they have ' embedded themselves in the cultural memory '			1
but the i lamented the lack of new material , calling the show ' a lazy production ' that relied on television footage and ' the whooping adulation of an audience who know all the words '			0
reviewer @entity163 admitted that some of the old sketches were ' still very funny ' but said it became a little tiresome			0
and comedian @entity167 conceded it was a show for existing fans , rather than new converts			0
tweeting after the show he wrote : ' witnessed legends in action			0
' someone enjoyed it : actor @entity176 , who made a brief appearance , tweeted about last night 's show the @entity179 was less enthusiastic , concluding that the show ' is n't bad '			2
' this live show wo n't make any converts			0
but it sends the faithful away happy , ' said @entity185			0
most enthusiastic , perhaps not surprisingly , given his brief on - stage appearance last night , was actor @entity176 , who tweeted afterwards : ' oh my days			1
just seen @entity189 - in fact i made a little surprise appearance			0
felt like being on stage with the @entity193 * sigh * ! ' five tuxedo 'd old geezers , necks like tortoises , creaked and croaked through a patchy night of their greatest hits			2
the @entity79 were back , courtesy of their vitamin quacks and @entity19 's ex-wife 's divorce lawyer			1
once they were the sharpest thing in satire			0
last night , quite often , they looked and sounded like a dodgy tribute band			1
we 're ok : the @entity207 took its inspiration from a discussion @entity20 had with an assistant cameraman , in which the subject was , the cameraman ’s former jobs			2
one of the jobs was revealed to be that of a lumberjack but the show finally reached something worthy of the hype and the high prices ( some tickets on the black market were going for close to £ 200 ) when they gave us such old favourites as the @entity226 sketch , the dead parrot sketch and best of all ' i want an argument '			1
@entity230 , @entity22 , @entity21 , @entity23 and @entity20 were appearing without @entity14 , deceased			1
hence the title for the show			0
age has not been kind to @entity19 who is all implausible teeth and pot belly these days - he is too lame to do the silly walks these days			2
@entity22 was wearing one of those irritating ponytails old groovers of a certain era like to sport			2
he seemed barely gripped by proceedings			0
@entity20 and @entity21 were the busiest , the most enthusiastic			1
@entity20 has the milky gaze of a retired geography teacher but he still looks perfect in a brown shop assistant 's coat			2
python fans filled the vast @entity9 and some of them had turned up in costumes - hankies on heads , braces , @entity252 helmets , etc. one the menu : @entity255 aux crevettes with a @entity257 sauce , served in a @entity259 manner with shallots and aubergines , garnished with truffle pate , brandy and a fried egg on top and @entity226 @entity21 bursts into song on the opening night of @entity11 ( mostly ) at the @entity9 they shouted along to the best - known sketches and cheered as soon as they heard familiar cues			1
yet some ardent @entity272 in front of me kept yawning			0
no opportunity was missed to milk this loyal public			0
shops flogged @entity7 merchandise , from £ 50 hoodies to £ 15 romper suits for babies			2
several punters could be heard complaining about the cost of the programme ( 20 quid to you guvnor for 48 pages )			0
argument clinic : @entity20 plays a man who pays to have an argument with a very contrary @entity19 in the interval an oh - so - jokey ' merch - o - meter ' was flashed up on screen to mock the idea of the @entity79 ' greed			1
ho ho ! but laughing at yourself does not necessarily expunge the rapaciousness			0
@entity176 made a brief appearance on stage to talk about getting a lightbulb getting stuck up his back passage			2
@entity304 was a cameo by @entity306 - was it really him ? we saw him in a film clip driving his wheelchair into tv 's prof @entity310 and pushing him in the @entity312			2
the chancellor , @entity313 , was also in the audience , perhaps collecting tips for his next raid on the super-rich			0
the @entity7 humour , at its best ( and last night that mainly meant old film clips such as the @entity320 ) , is genius			2
at its less good it has aged			0
@entity322 no longer buys many spuds			0
gags about the mentally deficient , gays and people with stammers are not much cop - but i did quite enjoy the camp judges			0
what would the old @entity330 have made of these sad old chaps ? they might have taken the rise out of them			0
maybe we should we more merciful and just thank them for the old memories .			0

@entity11 ( mostly ) opened a ten - night run in @entity42 last night
three decades since they last appeared on stage , the comedians were back
@entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 appeared
they performed old comedy favourites including the dead parrot sketch
but public *reaction* to the money - *raising* *reunion* was mixed to say the least
one @entity36 user wrote : ' @entity7 looked tired , pretty rubbish '
another said : ' @entity355 of skint old men trying to make a few quid . # bored '
@entity84 's @entity83 was also *unimpressed* , calling them ' dodgy tribute band '
