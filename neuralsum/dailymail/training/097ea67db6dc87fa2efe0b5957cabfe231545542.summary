by @entity0 the number of @entity3 immigrants sleeping rough in some of the wealthiest areas of the capital has trebled since @entity7 restrictions on movement were lifted in january			1
the rise in vagrants is reported to have sparked a spate of aggressive begging , pickpocketing and prostitution , which is blighting exclusive @entity16 addresses such as @entity17			1
revelations about the influx come after politicians dismissed predictions that there would be a fresh wave of immigration when @entity25 and @entity3 were given unrestricted rights to work in the @entity27 on january 1			1
yet now the problem has become so acute that @entity29 is set to hold high - level talks with @entity32 officials next week			0
homeless immigrants seen sleeping rough outside shops in @entity17 last week bands of up to 20 @entity3 beggars were witnessed last week setting up camps to bed down overnight around @entity39 and @entity40			1
those living or working nearby said the @entity43 gangs have been washing in fountains , dumping rubbish , urinating and even defecating in public			1
@entity47 , a sightseeing tour sales agent based in @entity39 , said : ‘ they rob , they steal , they make a mockery of the country and then the police come and give them free flights home			0
i know what they ’re up to because i see them every day			0
they sleep around the edges of the grass and shower in the fountains			0
’ @entity64 , conservative mp for @entity65 , last night called for the government to take urgent action			1
he said : ‘ @entity3 are entitled to come to this country , and many i know have come to take up employment and make a contribution			1
what is unacceptable is the vast increase in the number sleeping rough on the streets of our capital and there must be urgent action to ensure they are sent back to @entity3			1
’ those living around @entity39 and @entity40 said they have seen @entity43 gangs washing in fountains , dumping rubbish , urinating and even defecating in public during the last week last month , treasury chief secretary @entity84 called warnings of a rise in eastern @entity43 migration ‘ inflammatory rhetoric ’ and ‘ scaremongering ’			1
his comments came in response to official figures showing the number of @entity25 and @entity3 working in the @entity27 had fallen by 4,000 in the three months since employment restrictions were lifted			2
however , @entity95 , from @entity97 ’s @entity96 , said those figures had come too early to ‘ tell us anything apart from what had happened in a very short period ’			0
he added that it was ‘ certainly possible there will be an increase ’ in numbers of @entity25 and @entity3 migrants when further figures are released later this year			2
a pedestrian walks past @entity3 's sleeping rough in @entity17 in december last year conservative mp @entity109 , a member of the @entity110 , said : ‘ the previous figures were wrongly seized upon to show no influx of @entity3 and @entity25			1
‘ they were no basis for concluding that numbers will be low , so it is perhaps no surprise to see these real figures from @entity29 showing @entity3 immigration remaining a very serious concern			2
’ @entity29 ’s report shows that the number of @entity3 rough sleepers in @entity16 has risen from 20 in january to 59 last month			2
the local authority has been working with the @entity125 to use new powers to crack down on homeless groups			0
under legislation introduced at the beginning of this year they can deport @entity7 nationals sleeping rough and bar them from re-entry for 12 months if they can not prove ‘ they have a proper reason to be here , such as a job ’			0
meanwhile , the @entity32 has been footing the bill for flights to return offending @entity3 to their own country			2
but @entity29 ’s report states that in spite of these efforts ‘ we continue to see an increasing number of @entity3 nationals on the street ’			0
it continues : ‘ despite this excellent partnership work , there [ were ] ... 91 new @entity148 rough sleepers recorded as bedded down on the streets of @entity29 in may , the largest nationality were @entity3 with 59 individuals			0
’ council leader @entity153 said the authority wanted to take more stringent actions , but were limited by @entity7 rules			0
she said : ‘ we would like to crack down on it , but i ’m just not sure what more we can do than we ’ve already done ... with the @entity125 because of @entity7 regulations			0
until something is done about free movement there is a limit to what we can legally do			0
’ figures from @entity27 ’s biggest police force show that almost 2,000 @entity3 were arrested in the first three months after immigration restrictions were @entity168 said 1,906 @entity3 were held in @entity16 between january 1 and march 31 , along with 220 @entity169 led to 1,069 charges against @entity3 and 100 against @entity25 , from murder to sex offences and @entity174 contrast , in the first three months of 2013 there were 852 charges against @entity3 and 76 against @entity177 means there has been a 25 per cent increase in the number of charges against @entity3 this year .			1
