by @entity0 @entity1 should not shoulder the blame for @entity4 ’s early exit from the @entity5 according to @entity6 , who says the @entity7 need to look at their own youth structure			1
@entity9 claims @entity1 and @entity4 played well enough against @entity10 to win and go through to the next round , and supported his fellow @entity13 striker , who was heavily criticised after @entity4 ’s opening defeat by @entity15			1
‘ i watched most of the game against @entity15 and the whole game against @entity10 , and i think it is a shame			1
@entity4 played quite well and were so unlucky			1
@entity1 worked his socks off , played very well and could have scored four goals so i do n’t think he is to blame			0
level best : @entity1 ( right ) shoots past @entity21 to equalise for @entity4 against @entity10 long time coming : @entity1 celebrates his first goal for @entity4 at a @entity5 on thursday evening a portent of doom : @entity1 fails to nod home from a yard as @entity10 's defence panics down and out : @entity1 and @entity28 ( left ) trudge off dejectedly after another disappointing night for @entity4 ' @entity1 is a great player			1
as i ’ve said many times , @entity1 was partly the reason i came to @entity32			2
' i never regretted saying that because by training and playing with him he ’s shown me that he ’s a world class player			2
he ’s a great player and a great goalscorer			1
‘ he is always under massive pressure and that has been his life since he made his debut			0
' he hit an unbelievable free - kick , had a good shot saved by the keeper , a header which hit the bar and he scored a goal			0
he ’s not to blame , he gave his all for his country			0
it ’s not fair to criticise him so much			0
‘ he missed three chances by inches , and that is the thin line between winning and losing , between going home and going through			0
’ red devils : @entity1 and @entity6 share a joke as @entity32 train earlier this season dynamic duo : @entity1 ( left ) and @entity6 ( centre ) have struck up a relationship at @entity32 and @entity9 believes the @entity7 should look at their own coaching structure and invest more in youth development , as the @entity60 and other leading @entity62 countries do : ‘ now it ’s up to the @entity7 to have a proper look and see where @entity4 can go in the future			1
‘ it ’s very important to invest in youth , in good coaches and facilities for youngsters to play			2
there are loads of companies trying to encourage people to play more sport			0
the more hours you spend playing football , combined with good coaches , that is what makes you a better player			0
so it is important is to invest in youth and try to develop young players			2
