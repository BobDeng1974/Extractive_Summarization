during its 25 years in space , @entity0 has provided the world with unprecedented views of the universe			1
but to help it find alien life , @entity5 needs an even more powerful tool to peer back into the depths of our cosmos			1
the agency hopes to do this with the @entity13 , which will be 100 times more potent than @entity0 , and will be able to see back to 200 million years after the @entity14			1
the @entity13 will be 100 times more potent than @entity0 , and will be able to see back to 200 million years after the @entity14			1

' the project has drawn scrutiny from lawmakers for its ballooning costs - now at about $ 8.8 billion , far higher than the initial estimate of $ 3.5 bn ( £ 2.33 bn )			0
but @entity5 has promised to keep the next - generation telescope on track for its october 2018 launch			1
' what the @entity13 will really be doing is looking at the first galaxies of the universe , ' @entity13 telescope observatory project scientist @entity37			1
' we will also be able , with these capabilities , to look in very dark parts of the universe where stars are being born			0

there at least 200 billion @entity69 - like planets in our galaxy – and now @entity5 officials claim we could be on the verge of finding life on one of them			1
during a talk in @entity80 earlier this month , the space agency announced that humanity is likely to encounter extra-terrestrials within a decade			0
' i believe we are going to have strong indications of life beyond @entity69 in the next decade and definitive evidence in the next 10 to 20 years , ' @entity83 , chief scientist for @entity5 , said			1
' we know where to look , we know how to look , and in most cases we have the technology			0
' @entity91 , interim director of heliophysics at the agency , added : ' it 's definitely not an if , it 's a when			0
' ' we are not talking about little green men , ' said @entity83			0
' we are talking about little microbes			0
' the announcement has been prompted by the recent discovery of water by @entity5 in surprising places			2
@entity101 , director of planetary science at @entity5 , noted that a recent study of the @entity105 atmosphere found 50 per cent of the planet 's northern hemisphere once had oceans a mile deep			2
a joint project of @entity5 , the @entity111 and canadian space agencies , @entity13 will carry four instruments , including cameras and spectrometers that can capture extremely faint signals			1
infra - red capability will help it observe distant celestial bodies , and its camera shutter will be able to remain open for long periods , explained @entity120 , @entity13 project scientist for the science instrument payload			2
' the @entity13 will have 70 times the light - gathering capacity of @entity0			1
so the combination of the large size and the infra - red capabilities will allow us to observe this epic of the universe past , ' he said in an interview			0
even more , the telescope should further the search for life elsewhere in the universe by opening a new window on planets outside the solar system that might have water			2
already , @entity5 's @entity138 , launched in 2009 , has helped astronomers identify thousands of exoplanets			2
@entity13 is expected to propel that research even further			2
' @entity13 is quite big enough to have a high probability of finding bio signatures in the atmosphere of exoplanets , evidence of life , ' @entity120 said			2
' we have sensors on board , equipment on board that will enable us to study the atmosphere of exoplanets spectroscopically			0
so we will be able to understand the composition of those atmospheres , ' he added			0
' we can make big progress in the search for life			0
' unlike the @entity0 , which circles the @entity69 , the @entity13 will go even further , to a place called @entity160 , for @entity160 , 930,000 miles ( 1.5 million km ) away in space			1
that distance will keep the telescope cold , prevent it from being blinded by its own infra - red light and shelter it from radiation			0
' it will follow the @entity69 around the sun over the course of the year			0
so it 's in a sun center orbit instead of an @entity69 center orbit , ' said @entity120			0
the heavy telescope is scheduled to launch atop an @entity175 rocket , made by the @entity176 , from @entity177 in october 2018			0
' just as @entity0 rewrote all the textbooks , @entity13 will rewrite it again , ' said @entity120			2

@entity5 is on track to launch the @entity13 telescope in three years
telescope will be able to see back to 200 million years after the @entity14
it will be 100 times more powerful than @entity0 with mirrors 3 times larger
astronomers hope the telescope will help further the search for alien life
