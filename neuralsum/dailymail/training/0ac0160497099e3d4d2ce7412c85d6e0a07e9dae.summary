when seven - year - old @entity1 went trick or treating with her mother she hoped to get some sweets and at worst thought she may come across some scary @entity6 costumes			1
but when the child and her mother returned home to look at the treats she had gathered , they discovered an unwelcome surprise inside			0
in a sealed tub of @entity13 and @entity15 mix lay an inch - long screw			1
@entity17 , mother to @entity1 , said she was shocked by the discovery and concerned about what could have happened had a toddler , or her younger son @entity21 , got hold of the tub			2
@entity1 ( right ) was trick or treating with her mother @entity17 ( centre ) and came back with a tub of @entity29 berries and nuts which had a screw in			1
her mother was relieved her younger son @entity21 ( left ) had not got hold of it the screw was spotted after ms @entity17 handed the tub to her partner , @entity36 , 25 , to show him their daughter 's spoils			1
it is the second problem to hit @entity29 in a week after a pianist spotted a dead earwig in his wholefood salad			2

' we put the tub away in a cupboard , because we did n't want to risk the children opening it			0
' it 's a good job @entity21 was n't with us when we were out trick or treating			0
ms @entity17 said it was fortunate her daughter had decided not to open the tub until they got home ' i 'm sure he would have wanted to open the tub straightaway and i 'd have probably let him			2
' initially the parents thought the tub may have been tampered with by a @entity6 prankster , but when they checked it was still sealed			0
ms @entity17 added : ' it would have been horrible if a younger child had found the bolt			2
' it is not known in which @entity29 the nuts , costing £ 2.99 , were bought but ms @entity17 took the tub into a city centre store , where the manager said they would investigate			1
an @entity29 spokesman said : ' we 're sorry to hear about miss @entity17 's complaint			2
