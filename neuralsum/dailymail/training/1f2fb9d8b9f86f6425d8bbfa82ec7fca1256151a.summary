are @entity0 right to sack @entity1 ? it would have boiled down to a simple question by the end			1
can we trust this man to spend £ 200million ? the @entity7 would have sifted through all the available evidence and decided they could not			1
@entity1 is no longer @entity0 manager			1
the final reckoning would not have taken long			0
even @entity1 ’s staunchest advocates had exhausted their ammunition by the time the final whistle blew at @entity13 on sunday			1
appointing a manager without experience in the elite pool was a leap of faith and it has not been supported by results			1
yet he has been unable to dispel the doubts that existed going into this season			0
' he 's failed every challenge , so why would they trust him to spend £ 200m ? ' he did n’t have @entity30 experience and @entity0 conducted an inconsistent campaign that ended in the desperate measure of playing @entity33 , unfit , against @entity34			1
he did n’t have title - winning experience and @entity0 were seventh within three matches , not rising higher than fifth since			1
he had never won a trophy and the closest @entity0 came under him was a @entity40 semi-final , lost to @entity41			1
he was famed for caution at @entity43 and @entity0 are missing their attacking swagger this season			1
the job was , as predicted by a number of fearful @entity0 fans , too big for him			2
@entity51 : @entity1 has seen @entity0 fail to qualify for the @entity30 this season final straw : @entity1 watched @entity0 crash to their 11th league defeat of the season to former club @entity43 and @entity57 throughout his career has never spent anywhere near the sums that are set aside to revive @entity0 this summer			1
so why should the @entity7 continue believing in him ? having failed so dismally with every other new challenge , why should he be up to this one ? sadly , @entity1 has not added one new skill to his c.v			1
since leaving @entity43 , no fresh learning , nothing to suggest he is at home in the elite			0
and the overhaul of @entity0 this summer is a task for a high - end coach			1
big money will be spent , big names will be jettisoned			0
with no @entity30 , or maybe even @entity74 , football to entice leading players , @entity0 must show they mean business			2
the presence of @entity1 does not speak of ambition , not while he still has an l - plate attached to his jacket			1
@entity81 , @entity0 ’s chief executive , travelled to @entity82 on the day of @entity21 ’s recent @entity30 quarter - final tie			1
he said he might not even take in the game with @entity85 but knew that major @entity30 fixtures were wonderful occasions for gathering football ’s powerbrokers in one place			0
leading club executives , agents , super-agents , they would all be there			0
meetings , meetings , meetings were what @entity81 said he had planned			0
and maybe he did n’t like what he heard			0
perhaps the super-agents were not happy to place their super-clients with a club in the doldrums and a lame duck manager who could be gone by @entity107 if results did not improve			0
perhaps @entity81 discovered that with , say , @entity110 at the helm , talks would progress more smoothly			0
off the pace : @entity0 have failed to mount a decent challenge for the @entity114 this season it is pointless pretending @entity1 carries the same clout as his contemporaries at the major @entity74 clubs			1
he could n’t entice @entity119 from @entity43 and they had worked together for six @entity120 , or @entity121 , would bring a contacts book and a gold standard reputation			0
their presence shows a club has intent , their track records increase expectation of success			0
@entity1 ’s next trophy will be his first			2
he no doubt imagined breaking his duck with @entity0 but that has not happened			2
he has no profile among players beyond these shores — and what little he does is now bad			0
he ’s the guy who stuffed up at @entity0 ; just as , over here , it is @entity138 ’s duff season at @entity139 , not his eight titles in @entity141 , that are known			2
with the @entity30 creating a semi-permanent elite , football is no longer fluid as it once was			0
there is a hierarchy and @entity1 is not part of it , no matter the endorsement of sir @entity149			1
the clock is ticking : @entity1 ' time at @entity152 looks to have run out - despite the backing of sir @entity149 that is what will end with @entity1 ’s departure , too			1
@entity0 : the @entity149 years			1
while the @entity158 occupied his seat , the hope was that the @entity149 dynasty continued			2
here was a manager cast in his image , with the same values , capable of seamless transition			0
it was hoped the old ways would remain , but what now ? @entity110 is a calming presence , a healer , but @entity170 is a @entity172 heavy metal fan with a nose for mischief , and @entity175 learned many of his confrontational skills from @entity178 , now believed to be the leading candidate			0
whoever comes will rip up what remains of the existing blueprint because paramount importance is a swift return to the @entity30			0
@entity186 aside , @entity0 next season will largely be restructured around proven , established internationals or young players who have already made the @entity114 grade , such as @entity191			2
this is not a grandiose project , but a pragmatic , quick and expensive fix of this season ’s malaise			0
had @entity175 been available , he would have been perfect for the task			0
some will argue , with justification , that he should have got the job in the first place			0
making the call : executive vice chairman @entity81 speaks to @entity1 at the training ground this season there will be sympathy for @entity57 , stepping into @entity149 ’s giant shoes and falling headlong down the stairs , but the bottom line is he got a fabulous opportunity and blew it			1
' he stepped into @entity149 ’s giant shoes ... and fell headlong down the stairs ' he did not inherit a vintage @entity0 team but it still won the title by 11 points , scored 11 more goals than any rival and had a goal difference superior by seven			1
the defence was the most porous of any team in the top four but , even so , nobody can have expected a collapse of this magnitude			0
if they do not move beyond seventh place , @entity0 will have equalled the worst title defence in @entity114 history , matched only by @entity227 the season after @entity229 departed			2
the most damning numbers , however , concern their performances against the better teams			0
in 17 league matches against clubs in the top half of the table , @entity1 has won just three : @entity237 on october 26 , @entity238 on november 10 and @entity239 on april 5			2
backing of the fans : supporters at @entity152 hung a banner at the @entity243 in backing of @entity1 losing the fans : a section of @entity0 fans paid for a banner to be flown over @entity152 calling for @entity1 to go he is the first @entity0 manager to lose home and away to @entity251 and @entity43 in the same season , the first to lose at home to @entity254 , the first to fail to qualify for the @entity30 since 1995 , the first to concede in the opening minute of a @entity114 match , the first to lose three games in a row since 2001 , the first to lose at home to @entity239 since 1972 , the first to lose at home to @entity261 since 1978 and to @entity237 since 1984			1
he went out in the third round of the @entity264 , which @entity149 suffered only once in his @entity152 career and , even if @entity1 wins all of his four remaining matches , this will be @entity0 ’s lowest points total in the history of the @entity114			1
it all started so well : @entity1 was all smiles when he was unveiled as @entity0 manager in july as if this was not bad enough , the rise of @entity251 — and on a personal note the improvement at @entity43 under @entity274 — has put @entity1 ’s struggles into sharp relief			1
while @entity0 have plummeted , @entity251 have risen , from seventh to first in what may represent the greatest improvement by any championship - winning team in @entity284 football since @entity43 under @entity285 in 1983 - 84			1
and @entity251 ’s rebirth is what @entity0 fear most , not just as a local rival but as a force in the marketplace			2
@entity251 were a global brand in 1989 when @entity291 was still juggling balls on the pitch at @entity152 , and if they take their place among @entity297 ’s elite again there will be older generations across @entity299 , in particular , primed and waiting to influence the next editions of the family			2
@entity0 ’s revenue streams are those of the market leader , but a well - run @entity251 with an eye on commercial opportunities abroad could , if not match them , then at least take a significant slice of that action			1
added insult : seeing @entity274 do so well at @entity43 is sure to have dented @entity1 ' pride if the @entity114 trophy is secured at @entity315 on may 11 , its next destination after the open - top bus parade through the city the following day will be @entity316 for a game against @entity318 on may 14 , followed by a trip to @entity320 to play @entity321 , provisionally , on may 18			1
then there is the pre-season tour of the @entity324 , taking in @entity325 , @entity326 and @entity327			0
these are all traditional @entity0 strongholds , suddenly under threat			2
@entity21 have encroached on @entity0 ’s territory , too , with @entity114 chief executive @entity331 now listing the @entity333 club among those with a significant following abroad			2
@entity81 , the @entity0 chief executive , has been hailed as a wonder salesman , but he has never had to sell a club in seventh place before — to big business , big agents or big players			2
on the brink : @entity251 are close to winning their first title for 24 years @entity1 is the first casualty of that unexpected challenge			0
wondering whether the manager could grow into the job was just another question @entity0 ’s bosses had no time to answer			1
ultimately , @entity1 was n’t the @entity158 , or even a special one			0
instead , he became the @entity351			0
and swiftly , that problem has been solved			0
clearing the mess left behind , however , suggests a fresh set of problems for @entity0 are only just beginning .			0

@entity7 family did not trust @entity1 with £ 200m summer transfer kitty
appointing manager without elite experience was a leap of faith by @entity0
@entity0 missed their famed attacking swagger under cautious @entity57
@entity1 had a fabulous opportunity to *replace* @entity149 - and blew it
