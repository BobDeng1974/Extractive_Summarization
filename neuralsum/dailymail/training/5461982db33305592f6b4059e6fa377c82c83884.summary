by @entity0 published : 08:30 est , 2 september 2012 updated : 02:28 est , 3 september 2012 every restauranteur knows that good or bad reviews can have a major impact on their business			2
in the past these were most likely to be written by expert food critics and printed in newspapers , with the eateries concerned often given a right to reply to less than flattering write - ups			0
but in the age of the internet anyone can post anonymous complaints or compliments online before a wide audience - and new research has shown how crucial these reviews are to a restaurant 's future			0
ratings : the research found a strong link between good online reviews and increased restaurant bookings ( stock picture ) two economists at the @entity26 , professor @entity27 and professor @entity28 , have published their findings on the issue in this month 's edition of the @entity32			1
their work focused on the impact of positive online ratings on 328 restaurants in the @entity38 area - and collated this information into a star rating system on @entity41 , a ratings website			1
restaurants were given a rating on the site between one and five stars			0
the study found that eateries with an improved rating of just half a star sold out their 7pm bookings on up to half of the days they were open , reports @entity53			0
this increase was found to happen without any changes in prices or food quality - suggesting a strong link to the online reviews			1
the economists admitted that establishing a cause and effect between the reviews and a restaurant 's success was difficult because those that got good write - ups were likely to be popular anyway			0
reviews : many potential customers rely on online reviews when choosing which restaurant to go to success or failure : a bad online review can have serious repercussions for a restaurant ( stock picture ) however , the study found that when a restaurant moved from 3.5 stars to 4 stars on the website the likelihood of it selling out during its busiest trading times rose by nearly 20 percent , @entity53 reports			1
the impact of online reviews was found to be even more pronounced when there was little other easily available information about the restaurants concerned			2
the results of the study suggests that other popular rating websites , such as @entity93 , could have a similar impact on restaurant bookings .			2

study finds *direct* link between good online reviews and increase in restaurant bookings
even small increase in @entity41 ' star ratings ' can have a big impact on an eatery 's popularity
