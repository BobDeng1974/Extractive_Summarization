as the sun sets on a mixed first season back at @entity4 for @entity5 , the @entity1 boss will spend monday delivering his report of the season to all - powerful owner @entity8			1
sure to be in there are pleas for a new striker , men to get rid of and some things to improve for the next campaign			1
here , @entity15 goes inside the mind of @entity5 and imagines what ’s in that dossier			1
report : @entity5 carries his secret dossier for @entity8 in our mocked - up image rare sighting : @entity5 ( left ) is not often pictured next to @entity8 ( right ) @entity24 @entity26 i ’ve got my ' @entity26 ' back			1
he ’s been imperious at the back , finding his best form for five years			2
your no 1 mission this summer , @entity31 , is to sign him up for another year – at least			2
why on earth was that bloke leaving him out last season ? ca n’t remember his name … @entity36 i ’ve had to tell him off in recent weeks for not following the same rules that saw @entity38 exiled from ‘ the family ’ – sorry about that , by the way – but when he pays attention he ’s the best i ’ve got			1
he needs to knuckle down and shine in the big games , but do n’t worry , i ’ll get him into line			2
he ’s been playing to a level no - one ever thought possible – that ’s down to me , you know			1
and having @entity26 next to him			1
he can be a future @entity4 captain			1
up in the air : @entity36 ( centre ) is wanted by top clubs across @entity55 but remains @entity4 's star man head boys : @entity26 ( left ) and @entity45 ( right ) should be part of @entity4 's future plans @entity60 @entity61 i know you do n’t want to hear this , @entity31 , but spending £ 50million on this fella was n’t one of your smartest moves			1
it ’s been four pretty awful years , it ’s time to move him on			2
unfortunately your generosity means no - one else is going to pay his wages			1
@entity74 @entity73 are sniffing around him to the tune of £ 30m , and i would n’t mind getting my hands on that			0
usurped by @entity45 in defence , he turns up for the big games in midfield but is all - too - often a liability by switching off against the small fry			1
i ’ll miss his tongue - sticking - out @entity84 photos , though			2
@entity86 you know i love a runner , but you need to be able to pass the ball as well – @entity86 often has to be reminded that we play in blue			0
he ’s also been suspended about as many times as @entity93 in his heyday			0
hmm … i wonder if @entity95 fancies a return to @entity97 ? @entity98 , @entity61 : it 's time for @entity4 to cut their losses and ditch the misfiring @entity61 for good we play in @entity103 , @entity86 : the @entity105 midfielder ( left ) is full of energy but wastes possession i want @entity110 in case you have n’t noticed , i ’ve been hinting all year that we might , just possibly , need a striker			1
if you ’ve tuned in to @entity113 at any point this season , you ’ll probably have seen the @entity117 man make defenders break out into cold sweats			2
i saw your face after his team knocked us out of the @entity122 – we ’ll both be smiling next year			0
@entity123 you ’ll like this , @entity31 – you wo n’t even have to buy him ! he ’s one of your most valuable toys and someone else has been playing with him for three years			0
let ’s not break the news to @entity129 just yet , but i liked what i saw in the @entity122			0
@entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 … anyone will do			0
i know i ’ve already said @entity110 , but we need another			0
i do n’t fancy that big fella from @entity139 that seems to come back every summer , and @entity140 is busy applying for his bus pass			0
top priorities : @entity117 striker @entity110 ( left ) and on - loan goalkeeper @entity123 ( right ) new season resolutions 1 i ’ll leave the bus in the car park			1
everyone ’s been telling me you want this attacking football malarkey , so i promise i ’ll give it another go			0
i ca n’t guarantee i wo n’t batten down the hatches when the going gets tough , but get me a couple of strikers and watch us go … 2 i ’ll keep my trap shut			2
frankly , it ’s getting a bit expensive paying the @entity160 thousands of pounds every time i speak about referees , so i ’m going to keep my thoughts to myself			0
wind - up : @entity5 got the better of @entity165 but still finished below @entity167 's team in the table @entity169 felt : @entity5 will make his pleas to @entity4 's all - powerful owner for changes this summer 3 i ’ll win a trophy			1
history tells me you ’re not a big fan of managers without silverware and i could n’t bear to move again after settling back in @entity179			0
4 i ’ll beat some teams in the bottom half			0
i know you enjoyed beating @entity183 , @entity165 and @entity184 this year			0
if only we could use that expertise to beat the might of @entity188 , @entity189 and @entity190 we might be really on to something			0
full of hot air : @entity5 grabs a balloon on the touchline during the final game of the season at @entity197 5 i ’ll smile a bit more			1
having said i was the ' @entity199 ’ when i came back , i ’ve had a bit of a sense of humour failure in the last few weeks			0
let me borrow the yacht , buy me a couple of strikers and i ’ll be like the @entity206 again .			2

@entity5 is set to file an end - of - season report to @entity8
@entity4 boss will *highlight* *positives* and *negatives* of campaign
dossier is bound to *praise* @entity26 and slam club 's strikers
