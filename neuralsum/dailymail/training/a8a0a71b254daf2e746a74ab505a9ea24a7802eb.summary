a twin who was one of the most premature ever to survive is set to defy doctors by taking his first steps – thanks to @entity5 injections			1
two - year - old @entity6 was diagnosed with cerebral palsy in june , after a host of complications when he and his brother @entity10 were born 17 weeks early			1
doctors told his devastated parents @entity12 , 22 , and @entity13 , 23 , that he would never walk			2
but @entity6 defied medics to learn to crawl and doctors are now preparing to inject his legs with @entity5 , which they say could relax his tightened muscles and help him walk			1
two - year - old @entity6 ( right ) and his twin brother @entity10 ( left ) were born 17 weeks early			1
@entity6 has cerebral palsy and will soon receive @entity5 injections to relax his muscles and help him walk at first , doctors said @entity6 ( right ) would never walk like his brother @entity10 ( left ) , but he defied medics by learning to crawl			1
now , his parents hope the @entity5 treatment will allow him to take his first steps @entity6 ( left ) and @entity10 ( right ) amazed doctors after they survived being born more than four months premature			1
both were born with holes in their hearts , and had to undergo surgery just weeks after being born ms @entity12 , from @entity30 , @entity31 , said : ' at first the doctors said he would never walk and it absolutely broke my heart for him			1
' but now they 've come up with the idea of @entity5 and a walking frame because they 're really impressed at how much he 's come on			2
' his physio says it 's incredible			0
it has given us a renewed hope for him			0
' although @entity5 first achieved fame as a cosmetic drug used by celebrities to smooth out wrinkles , it also has a number of medical uses such as treating migraines and incontinence			2
@entity5 uses tiny amounts of botulinum toxin , derived from the bacteria that cause botulism food poisoning			2
the deadly nerve agent kills by paralysing the muscles used for breathing			2
cerebral palsy is the general term for a number of neurological conditions that affect movement and co-ordination			1
specifically , cerebral palsy is caused by a problem in the parts of the brain responsible for controlling muscles , according to the @entity69 website			1
the condition can occur if the brain develops abnormally or is damaged before , during or shortly after birth			0
the main symptoms of cerebral palsy normally become apparent during the first three years of a child 's life			1
they are : muscle stiffness or floppiness , muscle weakness , random and uncontrolled body movements , balance and co-ordination problems			0
some people with the condition may have communication and learning difficulties , although intelligence is often unaffected			0

in tiny doses it relaxes the contraction of muscles in some people with cerebral palsy by blocking nerve impulses			1
this allows better control of movement and reduces the risk of muscle and tendon shortening			0
the effects last between four and six months			0

the effects tend to last from four to six months			0
although botox treatment is now becoming more common for some cerebral palsy patients , not all @entity118 will fund it and there are often long waiting lists for treatment			1
@entity6 was diagnosed with cerebral palsy earlier this year			1
this followed a series of complications when he and his brother were born 17 weeks early , and became the most premature twins ever to survive in the @entity131 at that time			1
they were delivered at just 23 weeks , on june 13 and 14 , 2012 , weighing just 1lb 4oz and 1lb 6oz – much less than the @entity131 average of 7lb 8oz			0
the boys both had holes in their tiny hearts and at just two weeks old @entity6 had to undergo open heart surgery , with his brother @entity10 following two weeks later			1
medics also operated to correct bowel problems , performed laser treatment on their underdeveloped eyes , and put them on ventilators and oxygen to help them to breathe			0
but despite the odds , the pair survived and while @entity10 has eyesight and lung problems , he can walk and talk like any normal toddler			0
@entity6 's cerebral palsy means his muscle 's do n't work as well , and he ca n't talk as well as his brother			1
but regular physiotherapy has seen him learn to crawl and now it is hoped the @entity5 - usually used to smooth wrinkles - will relax his tightened legs			1
the twins ' recovery was hailed as a miracle given how premature and unwell they were			0
they are pictured with parents @entity12 , 22 , and @entity13 , 23 , two years ago while @entity6 ( far right ) ca n't walk and just makes noises rather than talking - @entity10 ( far left ) can understand him and tells parents @entity12 , and @entity13 ( pictured ) what he wants ms @entity12 , who is @entity6 's full - time carer , said : ' there is a lot of brotherly love			2
@entity10 will get two of everything , one for him and one for @entity6			2
' it breaks my heart because i always wonder if @entity6 is thinking ' why ca n't i do what @entity10 is doing ? ' ' @entity6 does n't talk as much , he just makes noises , but @entity10 knows what @entity6 wants and he tells us so that we know			2
' they are both a credit to us			0
i do cry on a night - i would n't wish what they 've been through on anyone			0
' i think " poor little souls "			0
it 's awful but they are getting there			0
i would n't be without them			0

@entity6 and @entity184 , from @entity30 , were born 17 weeks early
at the time , doctors said they may be the youngest twins ever to survive
@entity6 is unable to walk and was recently diagnosed with cerebral palsy
he stunned medics by learning to crawl and will now have @entity5 injections
it is hoped these will relax his muscles and help him walk like his brother
