by @entity0 published : 15:01 est , 6 may 2012 updated : 15:03 est , 6 may 2012 @entity2 children raised on rural farms in northern @entity4 suffer from asthma and allergies less often even than @entity11 farm kids , a group known to be relatively free from allergies , according to a new study			1
' the rates are very , very low , ' said dr. @entity13 , the study 's lead author			0
' so there 's something that we feel is even more protective in the @entity2 ' than in @entity19 farming communities			0
healthy : a study compared @entity2 children in @entity4 to children on farms in @entity11 , where most of the @entity2 originated what it is about growing up on farms -- and @entity2 farms in particular -- that seems to prevent allergies remains unclear			1
researchers have long observed the so - called ' farm effect ' -- the low allergy and asthma rates found among kids raised on farms -- in central @entity19 , but less is known about the influence of growing up on @entity37 farms			2
@entity13 , an allergist in @entity38 , has been treating @entity2 communities in @entity4 for two decades , but he noticed that very few @entity2 actually had any allergies			1
as studies on the farm effect in @entity19 began to emerge several years ago , @entity13 wondered if the same phenomenon might be found in the @entity44			0
he teamed up with @entity19 colleagues to compare @entity11 farming children and non-farming children to @entity2 kids in @entity4			1
just five percent of @entity2 children had allergies , compared to 11.2 percent of all @entity11 children @entity2 families , who can trace their roots back to @entity11 , typically farm using methods from the 1800s and they do n't own cars or televisions			1
the researchers surveyed 157 @entity2 families , about 3,000 @entity11 farming families , and close to 11,000 @entity11 families who did not live on a farm -- all with children between the ages of six and 12			1
they found that just five percent of @entity2 kids had been diagnosed with asthma , compared to 6.8 percent of @entity11 farm kids and 11.2 percent of the other @entity11 children			1
similarly , among 138 @entity2 kids given a skin - prick test to determine whether they were predisposed to having allergies , only 10 kids -- or seven percent -- had a positive response			2
in comparison , 25 percent of the farm - raised @entity11 kids and 44 percent of the other @entity11 children had a positive test , the researchers report in the @entity78			1
the study did not determine why the kids who grew up on farms were less likely to develop asthma and allergies , but other research has pointed to exposure to microbes and contact with cows , in particular , to partially explain the farm effect			2
drinking raw cow 's milk also seems to be involved , @entity13 said			0
the going theory is this early exposure to the diverse potential allergens and pathogens on a farm trains the immune system to recognize them , but not overreact to the harmless ones			0
as for why the @entity2 kids have even lower allergy and asthma rates than the other farming kids , ' that piece of the puzzle we really have n't explained , ' @entity13 told @entity105			2
he speculated that it could be at least partly a result of the @entity2 having larger families or spending even more time outside or in barns than people on more modern working farms			0
dr @entity111 , an allergist in @entity112 , @entity113 , said there 's also a possibility that inherited factors could play a role			0
' the @entity2 are still of a limited genetic pool , i would assume , because they 're much more segregated than the @entity11 kids are , ' she told @entity105			1
@entity13 said upcoming studies will further investigate the differences between the farming groups , with an eye toward designing possible interventions			0
for instance , pregnant mothers or young children could be exposed to the mysterious factors that seem to protect farm kids as a preventive treatment , he explained			0
' the goal is to try to find a way to prevent this allergy and asthma epidemic that western populations are facing , ' @entity13 said .			0

study compared children on @entity2 farms in @entity4 to children in @entity11 , where most @entity2 originate
@entity2 children have 5 percent allergy rate , compared to 11.2 percent among @entity11 kids
