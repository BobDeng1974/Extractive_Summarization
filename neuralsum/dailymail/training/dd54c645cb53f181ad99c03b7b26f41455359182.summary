by @entity0 @entity2 's @entity1 has accepted a two - match ban after an @entity5 investigation into his apparent dive during the 3 - 0 win over @entity8 last week			1
the @entity9 tumbled theatrically to win a penalty after a challenge from @entity13 captain @entity12 , who was red - carded in the incident			1
the @entity16 side were left fuming after the decision by match referee @entity18 and even @entity2 manager @entity19 admitted he would speak to his player should he feel he was guilty of simulation			1
unfair dismissal : @entity2 's @entity1 has been punished for his alleged dive against @entity8 reprieve : @entity8 captain @entity12 could now have his red card rescinded by the @entity5 the @entity5 probe into the incident concluded at the end of last week with their compliance officer offering a two - match ban — or the chance to fight that decision at a fast - track appeal on thursday			1
@entity2 announced on monday that they would not contest the ban and @entity1 will now miss league games against @entity37 and @entity38			1
the development is a boost for @entity12 , whose appeal against his red card will be heard on thursday			1
@entity12 said : ‘ i ’ve got to wait to hear officially but surely my red card will be rescinded now			2
‘ i ’ve not heard a thing yet but i think it was the right decision to cite @entity1			2
it does n’t help us though			0
‘ taking action after games has happened before			0
i remember @entity50 getting done when he was up here			0
so people know this can happen			0
‘ we had a meeting with the referees just before the start of the season and we were told they would be looking at people they think might have dived			0
‘ if they were n’t punished at the time , they warned they would go back and take a look at it and give them a two - game ban where it was a dive			2
‘ so they have stuck to their word with the @entity1 one			2
‘ i assume my appeal will be upheld now			0
i ’d be astonished at any other outcome			0

@entity1 has been handed a two - match ban for diving
@entity8 's @entity12 saw red for the incident against @entity2
the @entity81 went on to win the match 3 - 0 against @entity8
