it sounds like the ideal solution for older women wanting to have children			0
a controversial method to improve the health of an old egg is being used by a @entity8 - based fertility company			1
the firm , @entity9 , says its technique involves rejuvenating an egg 's mitochondria , which are the tiny structures that create energy to run a cell			1
@entity8 - based fertility company , @entity9 , says its technique involves rejuvenating an egg 's mitochondria , which are the tiny structures that create energy to run a cell studies suggest that 23 - 33 is the ideal time to conceive , as a healthy woman is still fertile and may be more psychologically prepared to have a baby			1
but fertility does begin to diminish slowly from the age of 25 as a woman 's eggs decrease			1
one report claiming that women are 10 per cent less fertile at 27			0
this is because they now have fewer eggs to fertilise - a few thousand - which are also older			2
but according to a report by @entity35 in @entity36 , experts advise caution over those claims			2
' they 're quite private and secretive about what they 're doing , ' dr @entity39 , a fertility specialist told @entity36			0
the technique , dubbed @entity43 , takes energy - producing mitochondria from a patient 's own ' @entity46 cells '			1
these are immature egg cells found in the protective ovarian lining , which are added to the patient 's mature eggs to supplement the existing mitochondria			1
' a key component of egg health is the number of functioning mitochondria in the egg since mitochondria are the source of energy that helps an egg develop , ' @entity9 co-founder , @entity53 , told @entity63 the idea is that immature cells with their healthy mitochondria could rejuvenate ageing eggs			1

the @entity43 treatment is not available in the @entity88 as the @entity89 ( @entity89 ) has n't approved the method			0
it is , however , available in some in vitro fertilisation clinics in @entity93 , the @entity94 , the @entity95 and @entity96			0
so far , more than 150 patients have received the @entity43 treatment			0
but there are still problems with the method			0
for instance , @entity101 , a genomicist at @entity102 in @entity103 told @entity36 that the follicles in the ovary are unlikely to be in any better condition			0
as yet , there are no any published studies proving the existence of the precursor cells the company says it uses			2
@entity9 has yet to respond to @entity113 regarding criticism of its procedure .			2

@entity9 says it has found a way to boost an egg 's mitochondria
mitochondria are the tiny *powerhouses* that create energy to run a cell
it involves taking immature egg cells found in protective ovarian lining
these are *inserted* into the patient 's mature eggs to rejuvenate them
but the company has been criticised for failing to back up their claims
