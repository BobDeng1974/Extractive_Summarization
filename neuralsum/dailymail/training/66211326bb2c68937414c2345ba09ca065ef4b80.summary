council budgets are more difficult to read than some of the most historically complex books ever written they are some of the most mentally challenging works ever committed to paper			1
but for those of you who find @entity11 ’s @entity7 and @entity9 ’s @entity8 a tad too easy , here is some required reading – your local council ’s annual budget report			1
analysis of local authority documents has found that trying to get your head around your a council ’s expenditure can be a much harder task than understanding the laws of gravity			1
texts that have puzzled students and caused them untold exam woe for centuries were compared against local authorities ’ most recent budgets			0
it found that some councils ’ spending reviews are much harder to get to grips with than weighty texts like @entity38 ’s @entity37 and @entity40 ’s @entity39			2
the report used a series of tests to decipher how many years in education a reader required to fully understand council budgets , measured against classic works of literature , science and philosophy			1
it found that @entity11 ’s @entity7 , the scientist ’s three - volume tome that detailed the laws of motion and gravitation , required 17.1 years of education			1
@entity8 , another classic work penned by @entity59 philosopher @entity9 , was a slightly easier read , requiring just 14.7 years in education			2
but the analysis drew up staggering comparisons with local authorities			0
it revealed that understanding @entity67 and @entity68 ’s annual budget required 20.5 years of education , while @entity70 and @entity71 ’s needed 22.5 years			1
transparency campaigners yesterday called for councils to stop using ‘ ludicrously difficult ’ language in their publications so taxpayers can decipher what funds are being spent on			2
the study used a variety of algorithms looking at aspects such as average sentence length and the average number of syllables in a word to come up with a difficulty grading			0
it used excerpts from over 40 council ’s most recent budgets , mostly taken from the introductory passages			0
councils scored an average of 12.6 years in education , which is still harder to take in than @entity40 ’s @entity39 , which scored 11.6 years			1
even @entity11 's @entity7 - a three volume tome published in 1687 detailing the laws of gravity - was easier to read than @entity68 and @entity67 council 's budget report , researchers found @entity103 ’s annual report was another of those that proved difficult to comprehend , requiring 16.9 years			1
this was gauged even more troublesome than the first chapter of @entity38 ’s @entity108 of @entity109 , according to the @entity111 research			0
@entity112 , spokesman for the @entity113 , said : ‘ how can taxpayers scrutinise @entity103 decisions properly when those decisions are explained in such a complex way ? ‘ too many of these documents are ludicrously difficult to understand			0
‘ every council must strive to be as transparent as possible , and that means writing in language that everybody can get their head round			0
’ a @entity39 , by professor @entity40 ( left ) , was easier to read than the average council budget report			2
it required 11.6 years of education , compared to the average council report that needed 12.6 @entity70 and @entity71 council , whose budget was the most complex to understand , said it is ‘ not easy ’ for council ’s to present their spending figures in an easily digestible form			1
councillor @entity135 , cabinet member for corporate resources , said : ‘ clearly any reports which meet the statutory duties placed on us as a council are unlikely to be simple or straightforward reading			0
‘ we are constantly looking at ways to refine the way we present complicated financial data to our cabinet members , councillors and the public			0
‘ we always do our best to put things as clearly as possible and will continue to look at ways we can make our budget reporting less complicated in the future			0

council budgets are more difficult to understand than the laws of gravity
tests were used to decipher education levels needed to understand reports
@entity67 and @entity68 's annual budget required 20.5 years of education
researchers found works by @entity11 and @entity40 are more *accessible*
