what @entity0 and @entity1 have done with @entity3 deserves more recognition			1
it ’s almost gone under the radar that @entity3 is now a regular for club and country , and indeed when he was suspended at the end of last season , that ’s when @entity0 dropped crucial points			1
i saw him play for @entity14 on the right side of midfield and despite lacking killer pace he looked a threat because of the quality of his delivery			0
@entity0 have taken him to @entity21 and under @entity1 he has become a brilliant midfield player who can control a game , keep the ball and use it with intelligence and quality			1
there are lessons to be learned from what @entity0 have done with @entity3			1
he ’s not the only one to benefit at that club			0
now that is an example of man - management and coaching at its very best			0
it was only just over 12 months ago we were wondering which path @entity39 would take as he seemed to be at a crossroads			0
he ’s already a brilliant player , imagine what ’s still to come from him			2
there ’s a bigger picture here though			0
and it explains why some talented youngsters do n’t break into top @entity54 clubs			1
man in the middle : @entity3 has established himself in the @entity28 team in recent months take last season ’s top four			1
@entity0 sign @entity61 players and make them better , and so do @entity62			1
@entity63 and @entity64 do n’t			0
they are under no obligation to of course , but then that ’s part of a big problem for football in @entity28			1
some top clubs have no regard whatsoever for @entity61 players or the national team			1
the situation in @entity76 is massively different			0
@entity77 is a gigantic club , but within its soul it harbours a desire to remain @entity76 , and provide players for the national team			2
it is a club that has n’t lost sight of its roots			0
it ’s a club that realizes – unlike so many short - sighted people in @entity61 – you can have club and country , there does n’t have to be a battle between the two			1
working his magic : @entity1 has made @entity3 into a key player for club and country this willingness to work with young talent and make them better - and in some cases get them ready for the @entity28 team - is one of the reasons why neutrals warm to @entity0 and @entity62 , and at the same time explains why there is a coldness , almost a dislike of both @entity63 and @entity64			1
the latter two clubs sign big players for big money and the manager picks a team			1
there is very little individual coaching and development of any players at these clubs			1
let me give you an example			0
@entity119 was brilliant as a teenager , but @entity64 have presided over the decline of a great talent			0
i spoke to @entity123 last week and he sounded energized by his move , but saddened that he had to leave @entity125 – he considers them to be ‘ his ’ club , that ’s where he really wanted to make it			0
energized : @entity119 is looking forward to his loan move to @entity131 @entity63 had the best player of the @entity133 in 2010			2
@entity134 ran the show , and led @entity28 to victory			2
he ’s gone out for yet another loan spell this season			0
individual players have to take some responsibility of course , but given the talent possessed by @entity123 and @entity134 , both @entity64 and @entity63 need to take a long hard look at how they do things			2
@entity63 ’s @entity146 record in recent years is brilliant – they ’ve appeared in four of the last five finals and won three of them			0
however you wo n’t find many people in football confident that any of these youth players will progress to the first team at @entity155			2
why not ? winning trophies is the priority of course , but clubs exist for other important reasons too			2
there are other goals they should set themselves			0
if a football club ca n’t coach individual players to fulfill their potential then there is clearly something wrong			2
maybe @entity64 and @entity63 should be braver and ask more of their coaches			0
maybe both clubs could learn something from @entity62 and @entity0 .			1

@entity3 is a key player for @entity0 and @entity28
@entity61 players struggle to break into top @entity54 clubs
@entity62 and @entity0 are producing good @entity61 players
