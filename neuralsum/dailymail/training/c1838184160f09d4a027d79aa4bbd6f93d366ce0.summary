by @entity0 arguments stem from the fact that both sides believe they are in the right			0
but while most people would claim the best way to win one is to try and convince the other party to agree with their views , a new study suggests otherwise			0
researchers in @entity12 discovered that by agreeing with the other person , through extreme examples of their views , can make them reconsider how they feel			2
to test their theory , the researchers , including graduate students of professor @entity18 , from the @entity19 in @entity12 , asked 150 @entity12 participants to watch videos			1
half were shown clips relating to the @entity12 and @entity25 conflict ( @entity26 pictured ) while the other half were shown neutral adverts to test their theory , the researchers , including graduate students of professor @entity18 , a psychologist at the @entity19 in @entity12 , asked 150 @entity12 participants to watch videos			1
to test their theory , the researchers , including graduate students of professor @entity18 , a psychologist at the @entity19 in @entity12 , asked 150 @entity12 participants to watch videos			1
@entity22 were shown clips relating to the @entity12 and @entity25 conflict , while the other half were shown neutral tv commercials as a control			1
the clips demonstrated how the conflict was consistent with many participants ' beliefs , but these views were portrayed at the very extreme ‘ for example , the fact that they are the most moral society in the world is one of the most basic beliefs of @entity12 society , ’ professor @entity18 said			1
but the video clips claimed @entity12 should continue to take part in the conflict so that its citizens could continue to feel moral			2
when questioned about their views on the conflict , following months of similar tests , the researchers reported a 30 per cent increase in their willingness to re-evaluate their position compared to the control group			1
@entity22 were shown clips relating to the @entity12 and @entity25 conflict , while the other half were shown neutral tv commercials as a control			1
instead of highlighting how the clips were at odds with @entity12 values , the videos instead demonstrated how the conflict was consistent with many participants ' beliefs			1
however , these views were portrayed at the very extreme ‘ for example , the fact that they [ believe they are one of ] the most moral societies in the world is one of the most basic beliefs of @entity12 society , ’ professor @entity18 said			1
but the video clips claimed @entity12 should continue to take part in the conflict so that its citizens could continue to feel moral			2
this caused anger among the group			2
when questioned about their views on the conflict , following months of similar tests , the researchers reported a 30 per cent increase in their willingness to re-evaluate their position compared to the control group			1
they also took a more neutral stance on common political ideals , and this shift continued even a year after the study had ended			0
the clips demonstrated how the conflict was consistent with many participants ' beliefs , but these views were portrayed at the very extreme			1
when questioned about their views on the conflict ( pro-palestine march pictured ) , following months of similar tests , the researchers reported a 30 % increase in the willingness of subjects to re-evaluate their views arguing with a partner is n't just upsetting - it 's also bad for your heart			1
people who think their partner is unsupportive are more likely to develop heart disease , a study has found			0
scientists at the @entity116 found people who claim their spouse is sometimes supportive , but also sometimes upsetting have higher levels of artery calcification			0
this suggests their arteries are diseased and they are at greater risk of premature death			0
the scientists attribute this to the fact that the new information caused people to see their views as irrational , according to the study in the @entity128			2
‘ we truly believe that in most intractable conflicts , the real problems are not the real issues , ’ said professor @entity18			0
in reality , he continued , both sides know what needs to be done but there are many ‘ psychological barriers that prevent societies from identifying opportunities for peace			0
’ ‘ you take people 's most basic beliefs and turn them into something that is absurd , ’ professor @entity18 said			0
‘ for an outsider , it can sound like a joke , but for them , you are playing with their most fundamental belief			0
’ the scientists said the method needs to be tested further			0
they also questioned how to get people to watch videos they find uncomfortable outside of the experiment setting			0
students @entity156 and @entity158 , who helped run the study , additionally expressed concern at the possibility the videos may assimilate the extreme views into the participant ’s beliefs .			2

researchers tested their theory using the @entity12 and @entity25 conflict
they showed half the @entity12 participants clips relating to the conflict
the other half were shown neutral tv commercials as a control group
instead of highlighting how the clips were at odds with @entity12 values , they instead demonstrated how the conflict was consistent with their beliefs
however , these views were portrayed at the very extreme
this caused anger , and following months of tests , the research reported a 30 % increase in the participants ' willingness to re-evaluate their views
