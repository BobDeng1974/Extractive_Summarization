by @entity0 published : 04:58 est , 18 april 2012 updated : 07:05 est , 18 april 2012 @entity1 is headed to the @entity2			0
well , maybe his uniform anyway			0
or perhaps even his glove			0
@entity2 has asked for some sort of memorabilia from @entity7 to commemorate his record - setting night as the 49 - year - old left - hander became the oldest pitcher to ever win a major league contest			1
and whatever the @entity2 decides it wants , @entity7 said he will certainly deliver after throwing seven efficient innings to help the @entity14 beat the @entity15 5 - 3 on tuesday			1
@entity16 performer : @entity14 starting pitcher @entity1 showed no signs of slowing down as he throws against the @entity15 in their @entity19 game in @entity20 ‘ to have your name mentioned with great players of the past or @entity2 players , it 's pretty special , ’ @entity7 said			1
for @entity7 ( 1 - 2 ) , making history was nice			1
but stopping the @entity14 ' two - game skid was just as rewarding			1
@entity7 was effective all evening as he picked up his 268th career win , tying him with @entity31 @entity30 for 34th on the career list			1
he relied on a cutter the @entity15 could n't get good wood on and a 78 - mph fastball that danced all over the place			2
@entity7 gave up just six hits and two runs – both unearned – as he kept the @entity15 hitters off balance and guessing			1
‘ today , for me , just like it 's been my previous two starts – going out and trying to give my best effort , ’ @entity7 said			1
that 's a tried and true formula for success , one that 's worked well for @entity7 over a career that has stretched nearly a quarter century and included 689 games			1
@entity7 earned that elusive win for the ages in his third start of the season			1
he is 49 years , 150 days old			0
third time lucky : @entity7 , 49,became the oldest winning pitcher in @entity19 at his third attempt that 's important to note since before @entity7 's effort the oldest pitcher to win a game in the majors was @entity62 of the @entity63 on sept. 13 , 1932 , when he was 49 years , 70 days old			1
@entity7 does n't know all that much about @entity62			1
he wishes he did , though			0
‘ as players , we should know more about the game , the history of the game , ’ @entity7 said			1
‘ you need to respect the game and the people that came before you			0
’ he 's definitely a part of baseball 's lore now			0
but this milestone win was far from easy			2
@entity77 struggled in the ninth as he surrendered a solo homer to @entity80 and put two more runners on before striking out @entity82 to close out the game			0
about the only flaw to the night were two more errors by smooth - fielding shortstop @entity86 , giving him six already this season			2
the @entity89 winner had six all of last year			0
power : despite the fearsome force and strain pitcher @entity1 has placed his body under during near 25 year career , he 's still able to deliver a devastatingly quick ball his fielding error in the seventh proved quite costly and nearly spoiled @entity7 's place in the record books			1
with two on and one out , @entity86 had a routine double play ball go right through his legs , leading to a run			0
@entity105 brought in another with a sacrifice fly to right to cut the lead to 3 - 2			2
@entity7 ended the threat by getting pinch hitter @entity109 to ground out to second on a 76 - mph cutter			1
with streaks of gray in his hair , @entity7 looks like a player who will turn 50 in november			1
but once he steps on the mound that youthful exuberance returns			0
he 's transformed into a kid again , sprinting out to the mound after each inning			0
on this night , he looked more like a spry rookie than a veteran nearing retirement – or at least his @entity126 card			0
‘ it 's a great night for the @entity14 , as far as winning a baseball game			1
but it 's an historic night for one tremendous human being , ’ @entity14 manager @entity127 said			2
‘ it could n't happen to a better guy			0
a more professional person i do n't know i 've been around			0
’ eyes on the prize : starting pitcher @entity1 ranks along side hall of famer @entity30 for 34th on the career list after notching up his 268th career win the aged wonder used his wealth of experience to his advantage against the young @entity15 , six of whom were n't even born when @entity7 made his major league debut in 1986			1
that included @entity147 ( 0 - 2 ) , a pitcher half @entity7 's age who went five innings and gave up three runs			1
@entity154 's first plate appearance of the season was a single in the opening inning			0
@entity154 was activated off the disabled list on monday after missing the first 10 games with a strained right calf muscle			0
that his first hit should be against @entity7 hardly comes as a surprise since the 36 - year - old @entity154 has a .583 lifetime average against @entity7			1
they even exchanged friendly grins after each of @entity154 's two singles			0
record breaker : @entity7 became the oldest pitcher to win a major league game at 49 years , 150 days , in his team 's win over the @entity15 ‘ he wears me out			1
i know it , ’ @entity7 said			2
‘ we joke in the offseason			0
’ @entity154 also has tremendous amount of respect for @entity7			2
‘ it says something about how much he loves to compete and his willingness to work , and at 49 , to go out and throw the ball and have success , ’ said @entity154 , who faced the veteran for the first time since june 13 , 2006 , when @entity154 was with the @entity186 's and @entity7 a member of the @entity188			2
@entity15 manager @entity191 certainly appreciates @entity7 's longevity , marveling from the dugout at the lefty who went to spring training without a guaranteed roster spot and performed his way onto the team			2
he missed all of 2011 as he recovered from a surgically repaired ligament in his elbow			0
‘ it 's a great story , ’ @entity191 said			0
‘ it 's wonderful that he 's continued to get the results needed to stay in the major leagues			0
this is a performance - driven game and the last 15 years of his career have been outstanding			2

@entity14 left - hander @entity7 picks up 268th career win
career stretches for 689 games over nearly a quarter century
breaks record set in 1932
