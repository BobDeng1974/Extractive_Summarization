published : 05:39 est , 11 october 2013 updated : 06:29 est , 11 october 2013 an army veteran has been told that he would not be allowed to stand for the @entity1 during a military concert because of health and safety rules			1
retired @entity6 gunner @entity5 , 74 , was informed by booking staff at a concert theatre that audience members had to be seated at all times during a performance by an @entity14 band			1
when he questioned whether the rule would apply if the band played a traditional rendition of @entity17 , he was told not to stand at any time			1
outraged : former @entity19 , 74 , above , was told he would not be able to stand to salute the national anthem according to mr @entity5 , organisers said the rule was a health and safety precaution which prevented people dancing dangerously in the stands			1
the veteran of @entity27 , @entity28 , paid Â£ 18 for balcony ticket at the @entity31 theatre in @entity32 for a ' @entity33 ' by the @entity34 in november			1
he booked to see the performance having served for six years as a @entity36 in @entity37 and @entity38 before a further 18 years as a @entity39			0
but after being told about the no standing rule , mr @entity5 described the decision as ' silly '			2
time - served : mr @entity42 , pictured here in his days as a @entity44 , said he was outraged that he could not stand for the anthem , saying : ' it 's what people fought for , so that we could be free ' he said : ' how dare they tell me i ca n't stand for the national anthem ? the national anthem is what this country is all about			2
' ' it 's what people fought for , so that we could be free			0
as far as i am concerned we should be standing up to protect it , not banning people from respecting it because of silly regulations			0
' it 's a lovely theatre but if they want to survive they should n't be doing things like this			2
it 's like so many things in this country , they want to stop this and stop that			0
' you 've got to wonder whether they 'll try to do away with the national anthem all together			0
health and safety is a good idea when it 's done properly but things like this really beggar belief			2
' under review : the venue apologised for the ' misapplication of health and safety principles ' and said it would review the way staff enforce the rule no standing : the @entity31 theatre in @entity32 , above is hosting a ' path to @entity95 ' concert by the @entity34 @entity96 , which runs @entity97 , said there had been a ' misapplication of health and safety principles '			1
a council spokesman said the rules were there to stop audiences dancing dangerously and not to ban them from standing in respect			0
he said : ' we will make sure that our staff understand how rules apply to this part of the building , for the various types of events held here			0

@entity115 veteran was told he could not stand for anthem at @entity14 concert
@entity119 said rules are there for health and safety reasons
