pope @entity0 greeted women who were forced into sexual slavery by the @entity4 military during @entity5 during a @entity6 at the end of his tour in @entity9			1
in a poignant moment at the start of the service , @entity0 bent down and greeted seven women , many sitting in wheelchairs , who are pushing for a new apology and compensation for their ordeals			1
one gave him a pin of a butterfly - a symbol of these ' comfort women 's ' plight - which he immediately pinned to his vestments and wore throughout the @entity6 @entity0 said in his homily that reconciliation can be brought about only by forgiveness , even if it seems ' impossible , impractical and even at times repugnant			2
' asking them to forgive : pope @entity0 greets women who were forced into sexual slavery by the @entity4 military during @entity5 prior to the start of a mass of reconciliation at @entity36 's main cathedral poignant : at the start of the service , @entity0 bent down and greeted seven women , many sitting in wheelchairs , who are pushing for a new apology and compensation from @entity4 for their ordeals ' let us pray , then , for the emergence of new opportunities for dialogue , encounter and the resolution of differences , for continued generosity in providing humanitarian assistance to those in need and for an ever - greater recognition that all @entity56 are brothers and sisters , members of one family , one people , ' he said			1
the @entity0 received the butterfly pin from @entity63 , one of the ' comfort women ' who attended his @entity6 these elderly @entity9 , many of whom regularly appear at rallies and other high - profile events , are looking for greater global attention as they push @entity4 to apologise			1
in an interview with the @entity71 before the @entity6 , another one of the women , @entity73 , who often speaks to the media , said she hoped the meeting would provide some solace for the pain she and others still feel more than seven decades after they were violated			0
@entity0 wrapped up his first trip to @entity83 today by also challenging @entity56 - from the @entity84 and the @entity9 - to reject the ' mindset of suspicion and confrontation ' that clouds their relations and find new ways to forge peace on the war - divided peninsula			1
one woman gave him a pin of a butterfly - a symbol of these ' comfort women 's ' plight - which he immediately pinned to his vestments and wore throughout the @entity6 seeking solace : the elderly @entity9 , many of whom regularly appear at rallies and other high - profile events , are looking for greater global attention as they push @entity4 to apologise historians say 20,000 to 200,000 women from across @entity83 , many of them @entity56 , were forced to provide sex to @entity4 's front - line soldiers			1
@entity4 nationalists contend that the so - called ' comfort women ' in wartime brothels were voluntary prostitutes , not sex slaves , and that @entity4 has been unfairly criticised for a practice they say is common in any country at war			1
many @entity9 women have demanded a full apology accompanied by official government compensation			0
in 1995 , @entity4 provided through a private fund 2million yen ( $ 20,000 ) each to about 280 women in the @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity9 and funded nursing homes and medical assistance for @entity125 and former @entity124 sex slaves			2
but some survivors refused the cash because it did not come directly from the government			0
repeated wavering since the apology among senior right - wing politicians has contributed to a feeling in @entity9 that @entity4 is in denial and not sufficiently remorseful			2
before boarding a plane back to @entity134 , the @entity0 held a mass of reconciliation at @entity36 's main cathedral , attended by @entity9 president @entity138 as well as some @entity56 defectors			0
it was the final event of a five - day trip that confirmed the importance of @entity83 for this papacy and for the @entity146 as a whole , given the church is young and growing there , while it is withering in traditionally @entity150 lands in @entity151			2
@entity0 's plea for peace came as the @entity154 and @entity9 started a joint military drill that @entity56 warned would result in a ' merciless pre-emptive strike ' against the allies			0
during his trip , the @entity0 reached out to @entity159 , @entity56 and a host of other countries that have no relations with the @entity163			1
the @entity0 will visit the @entity119 in january , along with @entity164			0
in @entity36 on monday , cardinal @entity166 , the archbishop of @entity167 , said @entity0 is offering ' a friendly hand to the other countries and assuring the countries we are not here for any worldly ambition , we are not here as conquerors , we are here as brothers and sisters			2
' @entity0 laid out these themes from the start of his visit , which was clouded by the firing of five rockets from @entity180 into the sea			0
@entity56 later said the test firings had nothing to do with @entity0 's arrival , but rather commemorated the 69th anniversary of @entity9 's independence from @entity4 occupation			1
calling for peace : before boarding a plane back to @entity134 , the @entity0 held a mass of reconciliation at @entity36 's main cathedral , attended by @entity9 president @entity138 as well as some @entity56 defectors the @entity154 - @entity9 military exercises starting monday and involving tens of thousands of troops are described by the allies as routine and defensive , but @entity180 sees them as invasion preparation			2
a spokesman for the @entity202 's general staff said in a statement sunday carried by state media that a ' most powerful and advanced merciless pre-emptive strike will start any time chosen by us			0
' such rhetoric is typical from the @entity84 and direct strikes by @entity180 are rare , although attacks blamed on the @entity84 in 2010 killed 50 @entity9			0
before the @entity6 , @entity36 cardinal @entity211 dedicated a ' crown of thorns ' to the @entity0 made from barbed wire taken from the heavily fortified demilitarised zone separating the two @entity216			1
@entity9 attend the @entity6 for peace and reconciliation outside @entity220 - dong cathedral in @entity36 ' ut unum sint ' reads the inscription - ' that they may be one ' - a phrase usually invoked when praying for unity among @entity146 , @entity226 and other @entity150 but given an entirely new meaning in the @entity9 context			0
in his homily , @entity0 said the @entity9 people knew well the pain of division and conflict and urged them to reflect on how they individually and as a people could work to reconcile			0
he challenged them to ' firmly reject a mindset shaped by suspicion , confrontation and competition , and instead to shape a culture formed by the teaching of the @entity242 and the noblest traditional values of the @entity9 people			1
' when he was a young @entity245 , the @entity244 - born @entity0 had wanted to be a missionary in @entity83 but was kept home because of poor health			1
he used his trip to @entity9 to rally young @entity83 in particular to take up the missionary call to spread the faith			2
he also used the trip to console @entity56 : he met on several occasions with relatives of victims of the @entity257 ferry sinking , in which 300 people were killed in april			0
throughout his trip , he wore a yellow pin on his cassock that was given to him by the families .			0

@entity0 met seven women demanding apology and *damages* from @entity4
ended first trip to @entity83 by calling for countries to resolve their differences
