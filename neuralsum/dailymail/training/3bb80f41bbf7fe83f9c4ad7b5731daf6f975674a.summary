by @entity0 published : 14:14 est , 31 may 2012 updated : 14:34 est , 31 may 2012 the former @entity2 student convicted of using a webcam to spy on his gay roommate arrived at the sheriff ’s office this afternoon to begin his 30 - day sentence			1
@entity8 , 21 , was driven by a family friend in their @entity10 and arrived at the sheriff 's department in @entity14 , @entity15 , just after 12:30pm to be fingerprinted and photographed			1
the student was wearing a navy blue t - shirt , khakis , and canvas sneakers , and also had a pair of plastic - rimmed glasses to go with newly - cropped hair			2
his father and two attorneys hugged him before leaving the sheriff 's department			2
shortly after he entered , @entity35 ’s father , @entity50 , and his defence attorney @entity51 left the office			2
sheriff @entity53 told the @entity45 : ‘ ( @entity35 ) got to say goodbye to his family , ’ adding that he would go through the booking process and would be taken to the @entity55			2
@entity35 was then driven to the county jail to serve a 30 - day term , though he will likely be out in 20 because of time off for good behaviour			1
the 21 - year - old is also appealing the sentence , meaning it could be thrown out all together			1
@entity35 's roommate , @entity64 , committed suicide in september 2010 , days after @entity35 used a webcam to see him kissing another man			1
emotion : @entity8 wipes a tear from his eye as his mother , @entity71 , right , reads a statement during a sentencing hearing for his conviction where she tells the court he was ' broken into pieces ' by the trial family support : @entity8 hugs his mother , @entity71 , after she reads out a statement to the court and imploring the judge to go easy on her son ' i learned a lot about bias crimes and bullying through this case , ' said a writer named @entity91			1
' the bullying and bias acts occurred when the legal system and media got involved			2
last monday , i was sentenced to 3 years probation , 300 hours of community service , a fine of more than $ 10,000.00 , and 30 days in jail			1
since the @entity101 appealed that sentence , the sentence does not have to start until the appeal is decided			1
nevertheless , i decided to accept and hopefully complete the sentence as soon as possible			1
it ’s the only way i can go on with my life			2
i accept responsibility for and regret my thoughtless , insensitive , immature , stupid and childish choices that i made on september 19 , 2010 and september 21 , 2010			2
my behavior and actions , which at no time were motivated by hate , bigotry , prejudice or desire to hurt , humiliate or embarrass anyone , were nonetheless the wrong choices and decisions			2
i apologize to everyone affected by those choices			2
i am surrendering myself to the @entity121 on thursday , may 31 , 2012 , to start my 30 - day period of imprisonment			1
' @entity35 is not to blame for the hardships endured by the gay community nor should he be tied to the whipping post because of it			2
if @entity129 was not gay , this would have been just a prank gone wrong and no one would have rushed to incarcerate			2
' soon after that , the letters began pouring into @entity135 judge @entity134 's chambers making requests for how to handle sentencing			2
@entity35 faced up to 10 years in prison			1
last week , judge @entity139 told him he would have to serve 30 days in jail			1
because the sentence is less than a year , it decreases the chances that federal immigration authorities will seek to have @entity35 deported to @entity145 , where he was born and remains a citizen			1
prosecutors said they would appeal the sentence as too light			1
@entity35 , who maintains he is innocent , is considering appealing the entire conviction			2
before delivering the sentence , @entity139 held up a folder , inches thick , of the letters he 'd received from the public			1
later , he quoted one of them , calling @entity157 's suicide the ' pink elephant ' in the case			0
@entity139 made the letters publicly available , but only after having court staff cross out the last names , addresses of and other identifying information about their authors			0
he said the writers may have expected their communications with him would be private			0
it 's a case that 's been dissected by pundits and advocates , addressed by president @entity171 , debated on by hundreds of bloggers , tweeters and online newspaper commenters and discussed at countless dinner tables			0
the people who decided to address @entity139 directly represent just one sliver of the public comment on the tragedy — but a particularly passionate one			0
tragic end : @entity2 student @entity64 jumped off the @entity182 in 2010 after webcam footage showing he and another man kissing circulated the internet residence hall : @entity157 and @entity35 shared @entity187 of @entity188 , @entity2 the case began in september 2010 when @entity35 's randomly assigned freshman - year roommate asked @entity35 to stay away so he and a guest could have privacy			0
@entity35 went to a friend 's room and turned on his webcam remotely			1
jurors at his trial earlier this year heard that he and the friend saw just seconds of @entity157 kissing the guest , who was identified in court only by the initials m.b. when @entity129 , an 18 - year - old violinist from @entity203 , asked for privacy again two days later , @entity35 agreed - then told friends how they could access his webcam			1
but this time , the webcam was not on when @entity208 came over			0
there was testimony both that @entity157 unplugged it and that @entity35 himself put it to sleep			0
the next night , @entity129 jumped to his death from the @entity182			0
jurors learned that he checked @entity35 's @entity216 feed repeatedly before his suicide			0
@entity157 is seen as an example of what can happen to young gays who are too often bullied even as acceptance of gays has increased			0
after the suicide , gay - rights and anti-bullying activists held him up as an example of the horrible consequences of bullying young gays			0
even president @entity171 spoke about the tragedy			0
