by @entity0 published : 19:39 est , 3 march 2013 updated : 19:40 est , 3 march 2013 @entity1 said it was ' inconceivable ' the next @entity4 manifesto would not contain a pledge to scrap @entity7 's @entity6 @entity4 ministers were last night urged by their own mps to stop talking and ‘ do something ’ over the @entity6			1
in a move designed to calm the nerves of backbenchers , @entity1 promised yesterday to scrap the controversial legislation			1
but this will not happen until after the next election in 2015 – and then only if the @entity4 win an outright majority			1
there was also confusion in @entity20 over whether the @entity21 are planning to make a manifesto commitment to leave the separate @entity23			0
such a move would be hugely popular with @entity4 activists			1
but no final decision has been taken , despite briefings by @entity29 officials that the party was ready to advocate the nuclear option of pulling out			1
to lift party morale after the @entity33 , mr @entity1 said it was ‘ inconceivable ’ the next @entity4 manifesto would not contain a pledge to scrap @entity7 ’s @entity6			1
the @entity21 made a similar pledge ahead of the 2010 election but have been thwarted by the @entity39 , who refuse to countenance any changes			2
mr @entity1 said : ‘ we can not go on with a situation where people who are a threat to our national security , or who come to @entity48 and commit serious crimes , are able to cite their human rights when they are clearly wholly unconcerned for the human rights of others			1
’ but he stopped short of committing @entity48 to withdrawing from the @entity53 , which the @entity6 enshrined into @entity48 law			1
mr @entity1 said only that he wanted ' a dramatically curtailed ’ role ' for the @entity57 court , which has come under fire for demanding the vote for prisoners			1
the judges have also blocked the deportation of terror suspects , including @entity64			0
some senior figures – including home secretary @entity66 – want the @entity21 to be ready to quit the @entity23			0
they believe it is doing huge damage to efforts to get rid of foreign criminals			0
last month mrs may unveiled plans to change the law so a foreign criminal can no longer block deportation on the grounds they have a human right to ‘ a family life ’ in the @entity48			0
but , crucially , there is no agreement yet to include the pledge to quit the @entity83 in the next @entity4 manifesto			2
insiders say such a dramatic step could split the party , with attorney general @entity88 and @entity89 likely to resign			0
some senior figures , including home secretary @entity66 , want the @entity21 to be ready to quit the @entity53 scrapping the @entity6 , but remaining in the @entity23 , would mean foreign criminals could appeal to @entity57			2
@entity48 would then have to decide whether to ignore the rulings – as other member states do – or back down			0
backbenchers welcomed the commitment to scrapping the @entity6 but do not want to wait until after the 2015 election			1
senior mp @entity97 said that if mrs may and mr @entity1 were serious they should bring forward a @entity98 , defying @entity39 objections			2
‘ we are in government			0
either do something now , and call the @entity39 ’ bluff on this , or stay quiet , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s that sort of cynicism , it ’s just politicians saying words and not doing anything ’			0
@entity111 leader @entity110 said the @entity21 always promised ‘ jam tomorrow ’ and claimed their supporters would no longer believe promises from the party .			2

@entity1 promised to scrap @entity6 after 2015 election
