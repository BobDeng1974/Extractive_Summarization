the reason for the growth of @entity3 's mighty mountain ranges has long been a mystery , but scientists have now proposed an intriguing theory			1
they say the growth is due in part to humans pumping groundwater our of an underground resevoir of water in @entity3 's @entity13			1
this causes the mountains to rise and fall the thickness of a dime and , while it 's a small amount , it could be responsible for increasing earthquakes in the region around the @entity22			1
unexpectedly fast growth of mountains in @entity3 's vast ranges has been attributed to human intervention , according to a new study			1
pumping groundwater out of @entity13 has made some mountains rise by as much as 0.11 inches a year			1
pictured is @entity31 in @entity3 to come to the conclusion , the geophysicists from several universities including @entity34 and the @entity35 carried out gps measurements of the region			1
they found that the mountains closer to the @entity13 , where the bulk of the region 's groundwater pumping takes place , grew faster than ranges further away			1
water has been pumped from @entity3 's @entity13 for more than 150 years , changing what used to be a marsh and extensive lake , called @entity49 , into fertile agricultural fields			1
in that time , about 40 cubic miles ( 160 cubic kilometers ) of water was removed - the capacity of @entity54 - dropping the water table in some areas more than 400 feet ( 120 meters ) and the ground surface 16 feet ( 5 meters ) or more			0
the weight of water removed allowed the underlying crust or lithosphere to rise by what is known as isostatic rebound , when there is no longer a balance between @entity66 's upper crust and its surface			2
this may have raised the nearby @entity70 mountains by as much as half a foot since about 1860			1
over the last 150 years , scientists estimate there has been a total rise of about six inches ( 15 centimetres ) in the @entity3 mountain ranges			2
the biggest rise has been around the @entity13 , though , where mountains continue to grow faster than expected at up to 0.1 inches ( three millimetres ) a year			1
it 's also thought that , in tandem with summer groundwater pumping , winter rains contribute to the changing heights of the mountain ranges			0
while seasonal changes in the @entity13 aquifer have not yet been firmly associated with any earthquakes , studies have shown that similar levels of periodic stress - such as that caused by the motions of the moon and sun - increase the number of microquakes on the @entity22			1
if these subtle seasonal changes are capable of influencing the occurrence of microquakes , it 's possible that they can sometimes also trigger a larger event , said @entity101 , a geoscientist at the @entity102 and co-author of the nature paper			0
' the stress is very small , much less than you need to build up stress on a fault leading to an earthquake , but in some circumstances such small stress changes can be the straw that breaks the camel 's back , ' @entity101 said			0
' it could just give that extra push to get a fault to fail			0
' the study was based on gps measurements from @entity3 and @entity70 between 2007 and 2010			1
it showed that the faster - than - expected rise of mountains in @entity70 and other ranges was due to humans pumping ground water out of the valleys in @entity3 , which could trigger stresses in the @entity22 the geophysicists made the measurements with the @entity130 's ( @entity130 ) @entity132 network of 1,100 stations , which provide millimetre - precision data on the mountains in the region , which have only been possible in the last few years the study was based on gps measurements from @entity3 and @entity70 between 2007 and 2010 and was led by scientists @entity139 at @entity34 and @entity140 of the @entity141			1
' other studies have shown that the @entity22 is sensitive to small - scale changes in stress , ' said @entity139			2
' these appear to control the timing of small earthquakes on portions of the fault , leading to more small earthquakes during drier periods of the year			0
' previously , such changes were thought to be driven by rainfall and other hydrologic causes			0
' this work ties overuse of groundwater by humans in the @entity158 to increases in the height of nearby mountain ranges and possible increases in the number of earthquakes on the @entity22 , said @entity165 , programme director in @entity130 's @entity166 , which funded the research			2
' when humans deplete groundwater , the amount of mass or material in @entity66 's crust is reduced , ' said @entity175			0
' that disrupts @entity66 's force balances , causing uplift of nearby mountains and reducing a force that helps keep the @entity22 from slipping			2
' the @entity181 , pictured on the right , is a system of canals and tunnels that takes water from places including the @entity13 across @entity3			2
it has been blamed for the recent rise of the mountains which could in turn be increasing the chances of earthquakes torrential winter storms drop water and snow across the state , which eventually flow into @entity13 streams , reservoirs and underground aquifers , pushing down the crust and lowering the @entity202 by 0.04 to 0.11 inches ( one to three millimetres )			1
in the summer water flow into the @entity204 , evaporation and ground water pumping for irrigation , which has accelerated because of drought , allows the crust and surrounding mountains to rise again			2
in response to the current drought in the region , about 7.5 cubic miles ( 30 cubic kilometers ) of water has been removed from @entity13 aquifers between 2003 and 2010 , causing a rise of about 0.4 inches ( 10 millimeters ) in the @entity202 over that time			2
@entity101 said that the flexing of @entity66 's crust downward in winter would clamp the @entity22 tighter , lowering the risk of quakes , while in summer the upward motion would relieve this clamping and perhaps increase the risk			0
' the hazard is ever so slightly higher in the summer than in the wintertime , ' he said			0
' this suggests that climate and tectonics interact , and that water changes ultimately affect the deeper @entity66			0
' @entity230 is doing the same thing as the @entity70 , which is part of the evidence that this ca n't be explained by tectonics			0
' both ranges have uplifted over the last few years and both exhibit the same seasonal up and down movement in phase			0
' this tells us that something has to be driving the system at a seasonal and long - term sense , and that has to be groundwater recharging and depletion			0
' the new research was published in the journal @entity250 .			0

pumping water out of @entity3 's @entity13 is making mountains grow faster than expected , according to a team of geophysicists
the scientists say human intervention is affecting the natural rise and fall
the nearby @entity70 mountain range is currently growing *3mm* a year
small growth could be increasing stress on the @entity22
this in turn might be raising the chances of earthquakes in the region
study was based on extensive gps measurements in @entity3
