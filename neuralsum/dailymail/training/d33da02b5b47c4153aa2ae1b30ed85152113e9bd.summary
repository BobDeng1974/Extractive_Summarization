@entity0 is already looking ahead to january in a bid to address holes in his squad with @entity4 set to lose top scorer @entity5			1
the @entity7 striker is almost certain to be involved in the @entity8 , which kicks off in @entity9 on january 17			1
@entity5 has scored four times in three games this season – his brace salvaged a 2 - 2 draw at @entity15 on saturday – and his goals have eased the pressure on @entity0 , at least in the short term			1
@entity5 's electric form is keeping his manager @entity0 in a job the @entity23 striker celebrates scoring against @entity15 but he will go and play for his country in january the @entity26 boss retains the full support of owner @entity28 and discussions have taken place concerning ways to improve fortunes on the pitch , where they remain winless in the @entity35			1
@entity35 goals for @entity4 : 2011/12 : 13 goals in 14 games 2012/13 : eight goals in 36 games 2013/14 : two goals in 24 games 2014/15 : four goals in three games @entity45 of the agenda for @entity0 will be identifying targets for the winter transfer window			1
@entity49 understands that a centre back with experience of the @entity53 top - flight is his number one priority , while bringing in a proven goalscorer – something they failed to do despite spending £ 35million in the summer – is also a must			0
@entity0 , whose side are third from bottom , said : ‘ our focus is on the short term and to see where we are when we get to january , because we really need to be away from the bottom six or seven			2
‘ otherwise , in january , we might need to do something , because we want to be in the top half			2
’ @entity0 , though , will have to be diplomatic in negotiating a transfer strategy for the @entity68 given the recruitment model which is in place at the club , chief scout @entity72 the man who still holds most sway			2
in the immediate future @entity0 needs a win when they entertain @entity78 a week on saturday to avoid being the first @entity26 manager to go eight games without victory from the start of a @entity35 season			1
@entity0 celebrates @entity5 scoring @entity4 's second goal to keep them off the bottom four - goal striker @entity5 nips in ahead of @entity86 to score against @entity15 crucially , the players remain behind their boss and defender @entity89 says media scrutiny surrounding @entity0 ’s future has not been easy			1
‘ that is what can happen with the frenzy they can create - you end up with a bandwagon people are happy to jump on , ’ he said			0
‘ but it is part and parcel of the game , there is no getting away from the position we are in and the results we have had , so that is the black and white of it			0
‘ it has been difficult , it always in when you have a bad period			0
but the lads are working their socks off and there is no lack of effort , we are all working hard behind the manager and trying to put things right			0
’ @entity4 defender @entity89 ( right ) is relieved the in - form hitman has returned to his scoring ways @entity120 wo n't be heading off on international duty with @entity122 after picking up a hamstring injury and @entity89 admits the return to fitness – and form – of @entity5 has come as a major relief			1
‘ half the battle is having a guy like that who is scoring goals regularly , ’ he added			2
‘ he has been fantastic			0
the attitude and work - rate he has shown when coming in every day during his recovery has been phenomenal and he is reaping the rewards of all the hours of hard work that people do not see			0
‘ he is proving a big lift for us with his performances and goals , he is exactly what we needed			0
​ ’ meanwhile , defender @entity120 has been forced to withdraw from the @entity122 squad because of a hamstring injury but should be fit for the visit of @entity78 .			0

@entity5 has scored four times in only three appearances this season
but the striker is almost certain to be involved in @entity7 's @entity8 campaign , which kicks off on january 17
manager @entity0 still holds the backing of owner @entity28 and is looking at transfer window targets
@entity5 has scored over half of the @entity159 ' seven @entity35 goals this season
@entity4 without a league win this season
@entity0 will become the first @entity26 manager to go eight games without victory at the start of the @entity35 season if they do n't beat @entity78
