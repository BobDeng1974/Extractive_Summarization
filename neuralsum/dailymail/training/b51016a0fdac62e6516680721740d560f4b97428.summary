by @entity0 there are a number of hand gestures used around the world that people recognise , regardless of what country or language they 're being used in - such as tapping your wrist to ask for the time , or writing in mid-air when asking for the bill			1
however , the rise in technology is seeing an number of new , tech - related gestures achieving similar global recognition , according to research from @entity20 for example , the @entity22 study found 89 per cent of people can correctly identify the finger swiping motion for ' the next page ' - and this exceeded the 83 per cent of people who identified the gesture for asking for a drink			1
tech firm @entity20 asked 6,000 people across @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 to identify nine hand actions			1
they included traditional , everyday gestures such as ok , established tech gestures , including ' texting ' , and more contemporary gestures , such as ' next page ' and ' scroll down ' pictured @entity20 surveyed 6,000 people across the @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 , and asked each participant to identify nine different actions			1
the first three were traditional , everyday gestures including the ok sign , made by pressing together a thumb and index finger , raising an imaginary glass to ask someone for a drink , and tapping a wrist to ask for the time			2
the next three were established technology gestures including holding an imaginary telephone to the ear to signify ‘ call me ’ , tapping a thumb rapidly to mimic texting , and typing on an imaginary keyboard when discussing emails			0
gesture rate of recognition by country call me 97 % 98 % 96 % 99 % 99 % 98 % 88 % 91 % 96 % 97 % 94 % 73 % i 'll text you 94 % 96 % 96 % 96 % 94 % 90 % next page 89 % 64 % 96 % 93 % 97 % 97 % scroll down page 81 % 38 % 86 % 84 % 71 % 84 % zoom out 18 % 37 % 95 % 89 % 18 % 30 % ok 91 % 72 % 94 % 87 % 91 % 83 % what 's the time ? 98 % 98 % 98 % 99 % 99 % 99 % drink - pint 83 % 30 % 34 % 74 % 42 % 32 % drink - shot glass 4 % 3 % 17 % 5 % 5 % 18 % drink - wine bottle 4 % 61 % 31 % 13 % 45 % 16 % respondents were then asked to identify three actions based on modern touchscreen hand gestures , namely swiping to the next page , scrolling , and zooming out			1
the vast majority of people in the @entity33 correctly identified gestures for calling someone and typing an email ( 97 per cent and 88 per cent respectively ) , while 81 per cent also correctly identified the ‘ scroll down ’ gesture			1
@entity85 , @entity20 's chief technologist for printing and personal systems in @entity33 and @entity88 said : ' this study shows how new technology is paving the way for new immersive ways of interacting with our devices			1
as expected , established gestures such as ' what 's the time ? ' had one of the highest recognition rates , pictured bottom			0
the sign for @entity102 was recognised in 86 % of cases , but people in @entity34 and @entity38 also thought it was the sign for zero there were cultural variations in the understanding of ' zoom out ' , pictured			0
in the @entity33 , recognition rate dropped to 18 % while @entity34 ( 37 % ) @entity36 ( 18 % ) and @entity38 ( 30 % ) also found the ' zoom out ' gesture harder to identify			1
respondents from @entity37 and @entity35 fared better , with 95 % and 89 % respectively ' we used to learn to ‘ speak ’ our computer ’s language , but today gesture - led technology intuitively works in conjunction with our natural language and movements			1
' there were some cultural variations in the understanding of the ‘ zoom out ’ gesture , however			0
in the @entity33 , the recognition rate dropped to 18 per cent , while @entity34 ( 37 per cent ) @entity36 ( 18 per cent ) and @entity38 ( 30 per cent ) also found the ‘ zoom out ’ gesture slightly harder to identify			1
in addition , just under a third ( 30 per cent ) of the @entity33 sample said that they did n’t know the meaning of the ‘ zoom out ’ gesture			2
respondents from @entity37 and @entity35 fared far better , with 95 per cent and 89 per cent getting it right respectively			2
when it comes to drinking , @entity35 and @entity33 most commonly mimed a large glass when asking for a drink			2
in @entity34 , the most common drinking gesture was the ' wine bottle ' mime			0
@entity37 used a mixture of large glasses and wine bottles , while @entity38 additionally used a short glass gesture , pictured gestural communication expert dr. @entity144 said : ' the findings suggest some gestures can give rise to ‘ iconic confusion ’			2
in the case of the zoom out command , for example , the fingers actually come closer together , not further apart , which looks like they ’re depicting a narrower , not a wider , perspective			0
' it ’s quite likely that the inherent contradiction of this gesture will slow down its spread , even in countries where touch screens are widely used , until such time as the gesture manages to gain a proper foothold '			0
the study also found age does not significantly impact a person 's ability to recognise new tech gestures with only a two per cent difference in success rate between the over 65 age group , and participants aged 18 to 24			0
' this is a story about the constant evolution of humanity and what we are seeing is a snapshot of a deeply fascinating process , as it happens , ' added dr. @entity144			0
' the younger generation has an inherent understanding of touch technology , and their influence extends to people who are much older			0
in no time at all ‘ touch tech ’ gestures will become a part of a universal convention			0

tech firm @entity20 asked 6,000 people across @entity22 to identify hand gestures
this included three traditional gestures and six technology - based actions
more people in the @entity33 recognised the gesture for ' the next page ' than the action used to ask for a drink
other gestures included ' zoom out ' and ' scroll down the page '
people in @entity37 and @entity35 recognised the most modern - day terms
