@entity1 sen. @entity0 said on thursday that he has set up a committee to explore running for the @entity4 presidential nomination in 2016 , portraying himself as a proven winner and a conservative willing to work with @entity6			1
the ' conservative ' part of that description wo n't sit well with tea party @entity4 and others on the right who see him as too accommodating to @entity6			1
@entity0 told reporters that his new website , called , ' @entity16 , ' will give him a way to raise money			2
he plans to visit @entity19 and @entity20 , the first to states to vote in the nomination fight , and see if his pragmatic , non-ideological message resonates			0
' @entity24 ' : sen. @entity0 of @entity1 announced on thursday that he has formed a presidential exploratory committee			2
he will annoy tea party @entity4 who see him as too moderate and accommodating ' what i 'm looking at is : is there a pathway forward on the ground in @entity20 and @entity19 for a guy like me ? ' the 59 - year - old @entity0 said on @entity33			1
' i do n't know until i look			0
' on such issues as national security and president @entity38 's health care law , the three - term senator said , ' if we do n't like what @entity38 's offering the country , what would we offer the nation ? ' he 's seen as a moderate on illegal immigration – earning him the nickname ' @entity46 ' – and has upbraided his own party for failing to reach out more effectively to @entity49 voters			1
he also helped write a comprehensive immigration overhaul bill as part of the so - called ' @entity52			2
' right - wing radio hosts mock @entity0 as ' @entity54 , ' for his ' aw shucks ' @entity56 twang			1
but he said on thursday that ' a center - right candidacy can prevail in @entity59			1
' ' i mean , are we going to be a party that embraces the fact that @entity6 exist and you can get no big deal done without their buy - in ? ' he explained			2
some @entity4 , most notably evangelical @entity67 , have been wary of @entity0 , the never - married and childless @entity68			1
and his pattern of compromising with @entity6 looks like a white flag to many of the conservatives whose enthusiasm drives fundraising and attndance at speeches during the crucial early going			0
@entity0 , they point out , voted for @entity38 's nominees to the @entity78 and is likely to vote in favor of @entity80 for attorney general			1
but his national security credential could carry him past the first few hurdles			0
@entity0 told a @entity86 @entity85 audience on thursday that ' @entity87 famously said his goal was to have peace through strength			2
in my view , you can never have peace with radical @entity95			0
' ' they want to destroy us and our way of life , so peaceful coexistence is a nonstarter from their point of you and , quite frankly , from my point of view			0
but you can have security			0
' the company you keep : @entity0 ( right ) is closely allied with @entity114 sen. @entity113 ( left ) , whose moderate approach to presdiential politics lost him the race to @entity38 in 2008 now two dozen republicans , including former @entity118 gov. @entity117 and 2012 nominee @entity119 , have expressed at least some interest in running next year			1
@entity0 bristled when asked how the party 's conservative base could trust him given that voting record			1
he pointed out three times that he won the @entity4 nomination for @entity126 by 41 percentage points			2
' i represent a form of conservatism that 's acceptable in the reddest of red states , ' he said			0
' i am conservative by any rational definition			0
' @entity0 has been a close ally of sen. @entity113 , the 2008 @entity4 presidential nominee who lost to @entity38			1
' i formally endorse him			0
he has my all - out complete support , ' @entity113 said thursday , according to @entity135			0
the @entity68 cruised to re-election in november , easily defeating six @entity4 primary rivals who cited his history of negotiating with @entity6 as proof that he was n't conservative enough .			0

the moderate is *reviled* by the right for his *patience* with the left
never - married and childless , @entity0 has time *aplenty* to explore a @entity148 run but lacks ' family values ' credentials
tea party @entity4 mock his voting record but he *insists* that ' a center - right candidacy can prevail in @entity59 '
@entity0 brings the total number of potential @entity4 presidential candidates to a *whopping* 24
he 's known as ' @entity46 ' on @entity33 for his role in *crafting* an @entity38 - style immigration bill , and as ' @entity54 ' on the radio for his ' aw shucks ' @entity56 twang
