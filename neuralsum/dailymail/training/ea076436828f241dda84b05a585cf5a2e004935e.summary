a new tv experiment will test the survival skills of a group of volunteers by tossing them back into the @entity5 where they must make fire , forage and hunt while wearing only animal skins			1
the eclectic band of men and women , who include a former male model , a farmer and a nightclub owner , will be left in a remote @entity18 forest for five weeks to battle nature and the elements			1
the groundbreaking reality tv show , called 10,000 bc , starts on @entity22 next week and will treat viewers to plenty of tears and tantrums as the disparate bunch struggle to acclimatise to a @entity5 existence			1
but any misconceptions they had about their five weeks of fame were soon laid to rest when the group was presented with a freshly slaughtered deer			2
the kill was designed to give the volunteers a running start - but for vegetarian @entity53 , 48 , from @entity54 , who 's there with her 23 - year - old daughter , @entity57 , the sight is repulsive			2
for the rest of the 20 though , hunger rather than eating preferences becomes the real issue and as starvation sets in , splinters and cracks appear in the group - creating scenes which viewers will no doubt relish			1
harsh conditions : the contestants must survive in @entity5 conditions and will have to make fire , forage and hunt while wearing only animal skins struggle : just two days into the five week experiment , two members of the tribe give up because of heat exhaustion and homesickness the programme was filmed over two months last autumn in a large but remote forested region of @entity18 - prone to extreme temperatures and inhabited by dangerous wild boars			1
by 10,000 @entity87 , humans had a range of technologies to aid them in their exploitation of the environment , most importantly the ability to make fire			2
the hunter - gatherer people of 10,000 @entity87 used stone , wood , bone and antlers for their weapons and implements			2
some groups practiced primitive mining , or more strictly quarrying , for flint , digging shallow pits and trenches			0
people wore clothing made from animal skins , which they sewed together using intricately - crafted bone needles			0
they had mastered the use of cords and threads fashioned from plant materials to aid them in making their clothes as well as for making baskets			0
their weaponry included spears , bows and arrows , and harpoons			0
people rarely lived past 30			0
source : @entity126 for their first two days in the wildnerness the participants are given tips by survival expert @entity130 , before being left to fend for themselves			1
before he leaves , two of the group have already surrendered to heat exhaustion and homesickness - less than than 48 hours after their adventure began			2
' as well as being about survival this is a social experiment , ' says @entity130			0
' we will discover how they work together and make decisions			0
some of them arrived thinking it was a camping trip			0
' the programme attempts to recreate the harsh existence of @entity5 men and women as much as possible			1
during this period in human history , hunter - gatherers were required to roam miles to find food and use flints tools			0
the tv show does allow some modern necessities such as sturdy hiking boots but the group still struggles to adapt - with the lighting of a fire presenting the biggest issue in episode one			1
a few hours later and the group have still not managed it - and as the light begins to fade , the rain sets in and dampens spirits even more			2
experiment : contestants @entity165 and @entity167 sit around a campfire during reality show 10,000 bc other contestants : vegetarian mother and daughter @entity53 and @entity172 ( @entity173 ) and @entity174 reflecting in his hut ( r ) the participants must live in basic - looking huts with no soap or cleaning products - and many admit to possessing no practical skills that will help them to survive over the five weeks			1
' i was born in the 1970s but that was 10,000 years too late , ' says astute 41 - year - old lorry driver @entity185 , from @entity186			0
as the show goes on , cliques develop , a leader is chosen and the group struggle to cope with daytime heat , mosquitoes and lack of hygiene			1
disputes break out as some members of the tribe fail to pull their weight and in one moment of desperate hunger , the discarded maggot - ridden remains of the earlier deer are dusted down and eaten			0
cracks : not long after they begin the show , the tribe begins to splinter			1
pictured , participants @entity207 ( @entity173 ) and @entity208 and @entity209 ( r ) hunger : despite spending the first two days learning survival tips , the tribe struggles to cope			1
pictured , participants @entity167 ( @entity173 ) and @entity214 ( r ) summarising the programme on their website , @entity22 say : ' these men and women will be going back to basics – big time			1
they 'll be hunting animals , foraging for food , subsisting on whatever they can scour from their environment			0
' they 'll be cold , hungry , scared and pushed to the limits of endurance			0
they 'll have no one but themselves and each other to help get them through			0
' how will they fare ? what will this demanding , exhilarating experience make them ( and the audience at home ) realise about 21st century life ? ' as the show goes on , cliques develop , a leader is chosen and the group struggle to cope with daytime heat , mosquitoes and lack of hygiene			2
pictured , participant @entity32 fetches firewood the group 's ages range from 20 to 65			1
above , oldest contestant @entity252 ( @entity173 ) and @entity174 ( r ) ' this programme is about exchanging modern life for a prehistoric one and to take stock of how our lives have changed			0
has it all been for the better ? ' either way , it ’ll be a highly emotionally charged roller coaster ride …			0
