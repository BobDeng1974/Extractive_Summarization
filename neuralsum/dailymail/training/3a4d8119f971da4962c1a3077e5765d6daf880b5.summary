by @entity0 published : 15:54 est , 2 december 2012 updated : 15:55 est , 2 december 2012 flying the flag : @entity2 with the @entity3 from @entity6 submarine @entity4 which has resurfaced after 40 years missing a @entity3 flag flown atop a @entity6 submarine has resurfaced - after going missing for 40 years			1
the flag was last flown on @entity4 at the end of the war in 1945 and was given to the boat 's youngest submariner , telegraphist @entity13 , at the end of its service			1
but the @entity3 went missing following @entity13 's death four decades ago and has only just been found again by his delighted son @entity19 in his sister 's attic			1
he now wants to see the flag flying again			1
mr @entity13 , 66 , from @entity23 , @entity24 , said : ' i was so pleased to have found it again , especially in such good condition			1
' i thought it had been lost but i 'd been nagging my sister to look for it and thankfully it turned up in her attic			1
' someone offered my £ 1,000 for it but i will never sell it			0
' i want to see it flying again as it would be the first time since 1945 and then i will give it to a museum perhaps			0
' the history of @entity4 is told by the symbols on the flag , with four bars representing the torpedoing of four ships and two daggers denoting the submarine 's two ' @entity46 ' operations			1
the eight stars in the top right corner surrounding crossed cannons represent eight times the deck gun was fired			0
mr @entity13 ’s father joined @entity4 , which was a t - class submarine , at the age of 18			1
@entity19 said : ' when my dad died he gave me the flag , a life jacket and his medals			1
warship : @entity4 was launched in february 1943 symbolic : mr @entity13 holds the flag aloft , the symbols surrounding the skull and crossbones illustrate the submarine 's history found : the flag flying atop @entity4 at the end of the @entity6 ' i was only young at the time and i think i traded his medals for some marbles , which earned me a clip round the ear			1
' i wish i had n’t given away the medals now but at least i ’ve still got the flag			2
' the first use of a @entity3 on a @entity80 submarine was in 1914 after it successfully torpedoed a @entity82 cruiser ship			2
the act was a humorous response to admiral sir @entity86 's remark that submarines were ‘ damned un-english ’ and crews of enemy subs would be hanged as pirates			2
during @entity6 @entity80 subs were allowed to fly the @entity3 on the day of their return from a successful patrol			0
the oldest surviving @entity3 flag , from @entity99 submarine @entity97 , is on display at the @entity101 in @entity102			1
the @entity3 dates back to the 1700s when pirates flew it to make their victims surrender readily			0
@entity4 was launched in february 1943 and served in the @entity107 for much of its wartime career			1
the submarine sank a long list of other vessels during its time in service including the @entity115 tug @entity116 and the @entity117 in april 1944 and several @entity120 @entity119 cargo ships			2
the craft survived the war intact but was scrapped at @entity123 in november 1950			0
the flag most commonly identified as the @entity3 today is the skull and crossbones , a flag consisting of a human skull above two long bones set in an x-mark arrangement on a black field			2
this design was used by several pirates , including captains @entity133 and @entity134			0
some @entity3 flags also include an hourglass , another common symbol representing death in 17th - and 18th - century @entity139			0
despite its prominence in popular culture , plain black flags were often employed by most pirates in the 17th and 18th century			0
historically , the flag was flown to frighten pirates ' victims into surrendering without a fight , since it conveyed the message that the attackers were outlaws who would not consider themselves bound by the usual rules of engagement — and might , therefore , slaughter those they defeated ( since captured pirates were usually hanged , they did not have much to gain by asking quarter if defeated )			2
the same message was sometimes conveyed by a red flag			0
since the decline of piracy , various military units have used the @entity3 , usually in skull - and - crossbones design , as a unit identification insignia or a victory flag to ascribe to themselves the proverbial ferocity and toughness of pirates			0
in a non-naval context the skull and crossbones motif has additional meanings , for example , to signify a hazard such as poison .			0

@entity2 , 66 , of @entity23 , @entity24 , found the flag , which belonged to the @entity4 in his sister 's attic
the flag had been given to his father @entity13 , a crew *member* on the submarine , but lost when he died 40 years ago
