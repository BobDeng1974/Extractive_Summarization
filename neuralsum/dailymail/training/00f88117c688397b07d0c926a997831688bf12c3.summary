@entity0 insists he would never cheat - at golf			1
the disgraced @entity3 cyclist - who was stripped of his seven @entity6 titles after admitting to doping throughout all of them - is a keen golfer and says the code of fair play is one of the things which most attracts him to the sport			1
he told @entity13 : ' @entity13 is different from the culture of cycling when i was competing , and that 's putting it mildly			1
cycling , it was the @entity19			0
@entity0 insists that he would never cheat at golf , despite being stripped of cycling titles for doping @entity0 ( left ) publicly admitted to cheating during his career in an interview with @entity27 ( right ) ' it was an arms race where absolutely anything went , and it was every man for himself			1
you might consider me the last guy to have anything to say about cheating , but golf is different			2
i love adhering to a code of honour that we in cycling did n't have			1
' if i moved my ball in the rough and got caught , i would n't just regret it , i 'd be heartbroken forever			0
when i think about reform in cycling , i think about golf			2
' @entity0 also expressed his sympathy for the way the media have treated 14 - time major winner @entity48 after revelations about his private life led to the break - up of his marriage			1
' did the punishment for what @entity48 did exceed the crime ? as someone with some experience along those lines , i 'd say it did			0
what happened was , the media changed , ' @entity0 added			1
' somewhere between the end of @entity66 's career in 2003 and @entity48 's scandal in 2009 , the media stopped being compliant to athletes and celebrities			2
they no longer protected them , because they no longer needed them			0
@entity0 sympathised with how @entity48 ( right ) was treated by the media during his marriage breakup @entity0 drew parallels to the technique 's of cyclist @entity79 ( left ) and @entity80 ( right ) ' in the digital world , all that matters is the scoop			1
the upshot is that there are no more sacred cows out there , and a lot more harshness			0
if @entity92 and @entity93 were alive and conducting their lives the way they did in their primes , they 'd be devoured			0
' @entity0 also spoke about @entity99 's @entity98 winner @entity79 in the interview , noting : ' ( @entity79 ) does everything wrong			1
he 's got a choppy pedal stroke			2
his arms are sticking out , his head is down , and he 's all over the bike			2
' he 's the @entity80 of cycling , unconventional in every way			0
and the reason it works is superior cadence			0
it 's paced in a way that gives his unusual mechanics time to fall together			0
the golf swing can be the same way			0

@entity0 lost his @entity6 titles *due* to *prolonged* doping
