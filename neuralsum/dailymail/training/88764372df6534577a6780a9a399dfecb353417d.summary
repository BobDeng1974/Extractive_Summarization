passing sentence today at @entity25 , judge @entity23 said @entity1 ’s driving placed her case in the most serious category for this type of offending			1
' it is clear these offences are so serious that only an immediate custodial sentence can be justified , ' he told her			0
' this is a long course dangerous driving			1
you caused other road users to take evasive action			0
' you only narrowly avoided two other head - on collisions			2
there maybe a strong sense of guilt but remorse requires , in my judgment , you to take or behave in accordance with that feeling			0
' it is impossible to reconcile your actions in absconding and how that affected mrs @entity2 ’s family with any real sense of wanting to put things right			1
' the judge imposed an eight year prison sentence for causing death by dangerous driving and a consecutive five month sentence for failing to surrender			1

mrs @entity2 was described in the statements as the lynchpin and the centre of the family , ' the judge told @entity1			1

the effects for them will be profound and life - long			2

' it is two and a half years since this horrific accident , which changed our lives forever			2
' fleeing to @entity10 was a coward 's way out instead of facing up to what she had done			0
' we all thought she would never be found			0
getting eight years and five months today will never be enough for what she has done			2
' she has destroyed the family and the future together			0
today we have a small amount of closure and we can try to move forward			0
' i hope @entity1 realises what she has done , having totally wrecked our family happiness			1
' because of her stupid , mindless act on september 23 , 2010 we are now a family of three			0
' @entity2 was my wife and my best friend			1

he said outside court : ' we are pleased with today 's sentence as it reflects both the seriousness of these crimes and the anguish that @entity1 has put her victim 's family through			1
' this case has been a long and complex one after @entity1 tried to evade justice by fleeing to @entity10 where she hoped to remain undetected			1
' the fact she was caught , arrested , extradited and has now been sentenced is testament to the hard work and dedication of the @entity184 serious collision investigation team			1
' @entity1 has proved to be a callous and manipulative woman who thought she was above the law			2
' we hope that today , @entity2 's family can feel that justice has finally been served			2
' @entity112 said @entity1 had robbed him of the love of his life when she killed his wife @entity2			1
in an emotionally - charged three page victim impact statement he wrote of his loss			2
' @entity2 was a fantastic wife , friend , mother and work colleague			1
there is not a day goes by without us all thinking of her and no words can express just how much we miss her , other than to say that our lives have been utterly devastated and that we miss her terribly			0
' @entity2 left for work and never came back			2
she was on her way home from work to be with her family			0
[ @entity1 ] drove straight into my wife and killed her instantly			2
at the same time she killed the hopes and dreams of so many other people			0
' i have had take a considerable amount of time off sick and go for counselling as a direct result of this matter			0
inside i have been falling apart , so much so that i have had to ask for help			0
' we were a strong close family until the day @entity1 tore this family apart killing @entity2			1
she then compounded matters by prolonging our agony and skipping bail to live abroad			0
this showed her absolute disdain for us , her failure to accept responsibility and her total lack of remorse			0
' our daughter @entity74 was unfortunate to come across the incident and was told by police at the scene that her mum was dead			2
she will have to live with the sight of the mangled wreckage where her mother was killed for the rest of her life			2
standing there at side of road with no - one to turn and no shoulder to cry on			0
it must have been awful			0
' from the moment i wake up to the moment i go to bed there is a gaping whole in my life			0
i often wake up in my sleep thinking that she is still alive only to turn over in the realisation that she is no longer with me			0
i miss her and love her dearly			0
' @entity2 and i were looking forward to both retiring and embarking on a cruise or a bit of travelling			2
none of our dreams or aspirations are now possible due to a stupid , drunken , inconsiderate woman			0
' i do n't think that she will ever learn the extent of what she has done and the affect she has had on so many people - many of whom are in court today			0
' @entity1 killed a wonderful wife and a wonderful mother			1
i want her to know that , i want her to know that for the rest of her life			0
