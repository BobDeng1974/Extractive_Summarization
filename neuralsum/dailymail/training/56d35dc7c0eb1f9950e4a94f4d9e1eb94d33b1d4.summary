with just over seven months to go until he becomes a father for the second time , the @entity0 has clearly decided some extra help is required			2
during an investiture at @entity6 , a ' charming ' prince @entity7 asked one of the nation ’s most senior midwives if she would like to ' come and help ' him and his wife			1
professor @entity12 , president of the @entity13 spoke to the royal about the @entity16 ’s pregnancy when he presented her with a cbe			1
' we talked about my being a midwife for well over 30 years and what ’s changed , and what i ’m doing now after becoming president of the @entity13			1
' asked whether she gave the prince any advice , she said : ' i almost said to him the second is much easier but i do n’t think i quite got that out			1
' he actually said to me , " would you like to come and help us ? " ' unsurprisingly , professor page 's response was : ' yes , of course			1
' professor page received her @entity17 for services to midwifery and delightedly told journalists afterwards that she is ' very proud ' of her profession			1
help for @entity16 : according to professor page , @entity7 asked her to ' come and help ' @entity16 during her pregnancy thrilled : @entity47 rugby coach @entity46 and mrs @entity48 were invested with @entity49 at the same time speaking about meeting @entity7 at what was the first investiture ceremony he has held at @entity6 , the professor said he was ' very charming ' , adding : ' and he said he was well looked after by midwives '			1
@entity53 of @entity0 , who is pregnant with her second child , is being treated for hyperemesis gravidarum , a form of acute morning sickness			2
as a result , @entity16 has not been seen in public since the news of a second royal baby was announced and has had to scale back her engagements on the advice of doctors			1
but although @entity7 was happy to discuss the royal pregnancy with professor page , she revealed that he said nothing about she is currently doing			1
yesterday the duchess sent a message of support to a children ’s art therapy charity after having to cancel a visit			2
proud father : the @entity0 with his wife and son during the royal tour of @entity79 earlier this year @entity80 : after the ceremony , @entity46 posed outside @entity6 with his new mbe honour : @entity84 and @entity85 ( right ) were also presented with @entity49 by the @entity0 she had hoped to attend the launch of @entity88 at @entity89 in @entity90			1
in a message read out at the school on her behalf , the @entity53 said she was ' truly sorry ' to have missed the launch			2
others receiving awards at the ceremony today included head coach of the @entity47 rugby team @entity46 who was awarded an obe , the headteacher of @entity104 sir @entity103 who received a knighthood , and former football referee @entity84 who received an mbe			2
during the ceremony , @entity7 chose not to stand on a riser as he wanted to make it more comfortable for the recipients , according to a royal spokesman			1
@entity112 afflicts one in 50 pregnancies and is much more serious than the nausea commonly experienced by expectant mothers			2
the condition is thought to be caused by elevated levels of ‘ pregnancy hormone ’ @entity119 , or human chorionic gonadotropin , which increases after conception			1
pregnant mothers expecting twins are often more likely to suffer the condition , due to the higher levels of hormones in their system			1
miss @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 at @entity130 in @entity90 and @entity132 @entity131 , told @entity133 ' twice the hormones ' often means ' twice the sickness '			2
she said : ' the condition is extremely common in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy			1
' it is associated with the changes in hormonal levels in the body , where the pregnancy hormones are quite high and it is the effect of those on the expectant mother			2
' if anything it is associated with a normal , healthy pregnancy			2
every so often , in extreme cases it is necessary to scan the mother to see if she could be expecting twins			0
' in twins expectant mothers experience twice the hormones , and so often twice the sickness			0
' she said the condition is usually diagnosed around the six week mark and in most cases carries on until 12 weeks			1
' the majority of ladies feel much better after 12 weeks , but a small group do carry on suffering the symptoms well into their second trimester , up to 24 weeks , ' miss @entity127 told @entity133			0
@entity112 leads to severe dehydration and puts both mother and baby at risk of being deprived of essential nutrients			0
sufferers can be left vomiting up to 30 times a day , with exhausting and hazardous consequences			0
they can not eat or drink without retching and may lose up to 10 per cent of their body weight when they are supposed to be gaining about 1lb a week			0
this can trigger a build - up of toxins in the blood or urine known as ketosis as the body tries to compensate for lack of food			0
hospital treatment for these women is essential , as without intravenous feeding and fluids they are at risk of becoming dangerously dehydrated			0
in less severe cases the condition can be managed with supplementary hydration , medication and nurtrients			1
some women take vitamin b6 – which prevents sickness – as soon as they know they are pregnant			0
others may take stronger anti-nausea tablets such as cyclizine , which is also used to treat travel sickness and is said to be very effective			0
sufferers are advised to take plenty of fluids and try to have small snacks throughout the day as an empty stomach can trigger nausea			0
if they can not keep food down they will need anti-sickness medication and to be put on a drip			0
miss @entity127 said @entity16 is more susceptible to suffering hyperemesis gravidarum , having endured the acute sickness during her pregnancy with @entity219			1
she said : ' if you have suffered this condition before , it is more likely you will again			1
' if you have already reacted once to the raised hormone levels in the way she has , it is quite normal during subsequent pregnancies			0
' she said in most cases pregnant women are given advice to avoid spicy foods and eat a diet of bland food including toast , bananas and mashed potato , little and often			0
' women suffering the condition are at risk of dehydration and so we often advise they keep their water levels up and avoid fizzy drinks , ' said miss @entity127			2
' for the majority of women these simple measures will make them feel better , but in some more extreme cases we would prescribe anti-sickness medication , something like @entity250 or @entity251 ( metoclopramide )			0
' if , despite everything , the expectant mother is not keeping anything down , and is suffering bloating , they are often taken into hospital where they can be closely monitored , given regular fluids and more regular anti-sickness drugs			0
' in very extreme cases , steroids can be given			0
' hyperemesis gravidarum can cause serious complications for mother and baby			0
those who are hospitalised , as the @entity53 was with @entity219 , before 12 weeks are around 20 per cent more likely to be at risk of pre-eclampsia , according to some studies			0
but miss @entity127 , who has 35 years of experience and has been a consultant for the last 25 years , said the risk of any complications for @entity16 is reduced given the fact she did not experience any during her first pregnancy			1
she told @entity133 : ' she did very well during her first pregnancy , and as a result there is no reason to think anything will be different this time around			0
' second pregnancies are kinder and easier on the body , because the body has done it before			0
' @entity16 will know what to expect and there is no reason she will face any complications .			1
