today the 19 - year - old is pictured with newborn son @entity11 who seems to have escaped the attack unharmed			1
brave : @entity5 pictured with her newborn son @entity11 a month after she was attacked on her way to an appointment with her midwife police in @entity19 are still hunting the attacker who left 19 - year - old @entity5 groaning and covered in blood , fearful that her unborn baby had been damaged or even killed in the womb by the force of the savage blows			1
even though she screamed that she was nine months pregnant , the brute kept raining blows on her			1
a police spokesman said this afternoon : ' she and the baby are doing fine			1
it ’s been a terrible ordeal but she is coping really well and of course little @entity11 has brought a smile to her face			2
' @entity5 tried to fight off her attacker who pounced as she walked along @entity37 in @entity38 between 9.30am and 9.50am on tuesday june 26th			2
nine months pregnant , she was on her way to keep a hospital appointment with the midwife			1
the attacker started hitting her in the face without any warning as she walked along the deserted lane			2
brutal : @entity5 's attacker only stopped when a member of the public intervened police described it as a ‘ vicious , prolonged and random attack ’ and said her injuries could have been far more severe had she not courageously fought back , hitting and scratching at the man			1
a passer - by heard the commotion and rushed to help , and the attacker ran off			2
an ambulance took @entity5 to hospital where she received treatment for severe facial bruising			0
doctors checked her unborn baby and assured her it had survived			0
one of the investigating officers , detective sergeant @entity65 , said at the time ‘ luckily the victim has not been seriously injured but is in shock because of this incident			0
she tried bravely to stop the assault herself and because of her condition the result of this attack could have been much worse			0
‘ it is not clear what the motivation behind this attack was but clearly we need the public to help identify the man responsible			0
” pretty : @entity5 smiling and relaxing just days before the unprovoked assault police appealed to anyone who witnessed the attack or noticed someone loitering in the area matching the description to come forward			2
the attacker was a white man , 5ft 5ins tall , skinny build with short brown hair			0
he was wearing blue jeans and a light coloured top , possibly grey or khaki			0
another officer , detective constable @entity94 , said police are keen to speak to a boy on a bicycle who was wearing a white t - shirt , and a girl who was seen talking to him at the junction of @entity103 and @entity104			1
she added ‘ i am pleased to say that @entity5 and her new baby are doing very well and @entity5 is recovering from the facial injuries she sustained during the assault			0
‘ we hope that the posters distributed this week in the area will spark people ’s memories and encourage the young man and woman who were seen standing at the junction of @entity38 and @entity104 to come forward and speak to officers			0
‘ these people do not have anything to fear but they could help identify others in the area			0
’ shocking : @entity5 , who is nine - months pregnant , was attacked on her way to a hospital appointment			1
