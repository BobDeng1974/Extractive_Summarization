by @entity0 prisoners convicted of violent crimes are getting free weddings if they tie the knot behind bars			1
cash for the 27 marriages that took place inside prisons in @entity10 – and even the buffet – came from the jail kitty , which is made up of profits from the prison shop			1
among those who have tied the knot in the last decade include @entity17 , who married partner @entity18 at @entity19 , less than six months after he was put in prison for a drink - drive crash which resulted in the death of two pensioners and injured a third			0
@entity24 hosted the most weddings in @entity10 last year as well as convicted @entity17 's @entity26 of @entity27 , who was jailed for the murder of @entity30 in 2008 when he savagely set him on fire and sliced his ear off before leaving him in woodland , was also allowed to marry in prison			1
other inmates walking down the aisle include murderers , drug dealers and burglars – all of whom were men			1
but the prison service has said weddings for inmates are ‘ beneficial ’ in the rehabilitation process			1
a spokesman from the @entity47 ( @entity47 ) said : ‘ a small number of prisoners are granted permission to marry by the governor			2
‘ @entity47 recognises the benefit in strengthening family support for prisoners in terms of preparation for release and reducing reoffending			0
’ inmates walking down the aisle include murderers , drug dealers and burglars all of whom were men he added : ‘ it is not a wedding in a grand hotel , it ’s a prison			1
’ the service notes that if the ceremony is free if it is conducted by the prison ’s chaplain and if it is a civil ceremony then the cost of a registrar must be met by couple it says in some prisons the cost of a buffet , for a maximum of six guests plus the couple , is covered by the @entity82 , which comes from donations and profits raised from sales in the on - site shop			2
the prison service spokesman added : ‘ the food comes from the prison canteen , it includes cheap sandwiches and sausage rolls			0
’ couples are also entitled to use an artificial flower arrangement free of charge			0
however @entity98 , 84 , of taxpayer campaign group is it fair ? told the @entity101 : ‘ inmates are in a prison to serve a sentence because they ’ve done something wrong , not to be rewarded like this ’			2
@entity107 from the @entity108 said : ' law - abiding taxpayers outside jail walls have to pay for their own weddings , and prisoners should be no different			0
' people up and down the @entity114 think long and hard about whether they can afford to tie the knot , and will be furious that they 're paying so others do n't have to face that same decision			0

the 27 marriages and buffet were paid for by prison 's @entity82
convicted murderers and drug dealers were among those to tie the knot
@entity47 said weddings are beneficial to prisoners rehab
campaign groups say inmates are in prison for doing wrong , not for rewards
