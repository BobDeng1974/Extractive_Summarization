by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 announced friday that the rebels believed to be behind the rocket attack on a @entity6 jetliner in eastern @entity7 have had ' a steady stream of support from @entity10 , ' but stopped short of calling for an immediate pushback against @entity12			1
the @entity1 president 's brief but substantial comments about deaths that he called ' an outrage of unspeakable proportions ' came 24 hours after he coolly inserted a 40 - second statement about the plane crash into a 16 - minute oration about domestic transportation policy , drawing gasps and guffaws from @entity1			1
' this certainly will be a wake - up call for @entity26 and the world that there are consequences to escalating a regional conflict in the @entity7 , ' he said in the @entity32 press briefing room on friday , cautioning that it 's not yet completely clear ' what individuals , or groups of individuals ordered the strike			1
' but ' it is not possible for these separatists to function the way they 're functioning ' without @entity12 's involvement , he insisted			2
' a group of separatists ca n't shoot down military transport planes ... without sophisticated training and sophisticated equipment			0
and that is coming from @entity10			2
' and so far , at least , he has not exercised it			0
' those words came off as softer than those of his former top diplomat , @entity70 , who is presumed to be running to replace him in two years ' time			2
a network of high - tech eavesdropping and early - warning satellites operated by the @entity77 most likely played a key role in determining that the @entity79 was shot down by a @entity10 - made surface - to - air missile over the @entity7			1
according to a report by the @entity83 , intelligence officials almost certainly relied on a technical discipline known as measurement and signature intelligence , also known as @entity86 , to obtain key bits of information about the missile launch			0
the sophisticated system of satellites at the @entity77 ’s disposal could have pinpointed the location from which the missile was fired and plotted out its trajectory as it shot up into the sky on a collision course with the @entity98			0
@entity99 , founder and chairman of @entity101 , an industry lobby , told the paper that intelligence analysts would have become aware the missile launch because of its heat signature			0
@entity1 @entity107 - operated satellites orbiting the @entity108 are equipped with hyper - sensitive sensors that pick up on heat from missile and booster plumes			1
in fact , the detectors are so fine - tuned that they even spot forest fires			0
the system of satellites , run as part of the @entity119 , sends back early warnings each time it detects an intercontinental ballistic missile launch			0
also , @entity1 radars scattered around @entity26 have the capacity to provide data on the exact launch site , the missile ’s destination and its speed			1
the other vital intelligence tool is a fleet of @entity1 listening satellites that collect electronic signals from foreign defense systems			2
armed with this data , @entity1 analysts would be able to determine the source of the signals and the weapon used			0
the @entity10 - made @entity140 missiles , like the one that downed the jet thursday with 298 people on board , are equipped with a radar system that gives off unique signals , making it possible to triangulate the launch site and trace its route			2
source : @entity83 the @entity1 needs to ' put @entity64 on notice that he has gone too far and we are not going to stand idly by , ' she told @entity156 host @entity155 on thursday night			1
' commercial airliners are big targets , but by the time they got over that part of @entity7 they should have been high , so it takes some planning			0
' @entity2 demanded ' an immediate cease - fire ' on friday so the 298 dead could be recovered and the crash scene secured			2
the downed @entity54 , he said , ' should snap everybody 's heads to attention ' on the question of @entity10 's hand in supporting anti-government forces in eastern @entity7			1
' we do n't have time for propaganda , we do n't have time for games , ' he said			0
but the @entity1 , he said , does have time for ' a credible international investigation ' to take place			0
he said investigators from the @entity183 and the @entity184 were en route to eastern @entity7 to help determine the details of what happened as the aircraft , carrying 298 souls between @entity190 and @entity191 , flew at 32,000 feet near the intersection of @entity7 and @entity10 airspace			1
' are they going to continue to support violent separatists whose goal is to overthrow the government of @entity7 ? ' @entity2 asked			1
' as @entity10 engages in efforts that are supporting the separatists , we have the capacity to increase the costs we impose on them , and we will do so			1
' but @entity2 has n't hinted at what a new round of sanctions might look like			2
just this week his administration imposed new financial penalties and restrictions on a range of @entity10 - owned banks and other businesses , freezing them out of long - term @entity1 bank borrowing			1
it 's unclear whether his @entity214 has contemplated what a broader sanctions package would look like			0
secretary of state @entity217 has been quiet on the question , and the president indicated friday that such talk would be a cart before the horse			0
' we do n't know exactly what happened yet , ' he said , urging @entity1 not to ' get out ahead of the facts			0
' @entity2 named a single @entity1 on friday , @entity57 , as ' the sole person that we can definitively say is a @entity1 or dual citizen ' and was on the doomed aircraft			1
on thursday reports swirled of as many as 23 @entity1 having been on board			2
@entity1 senator @entity231 said thursday that there would be ' hell to pay , and there should be , ' if @entity10 forces or @entity237 separatists in @entity7 were behind the missile attack			1
@entity239 : @entity10 president @entity64 's government has trained and equipped anti-government rebels in @entity7 , @entity2 claimed on friday @entity231 unleashed : the hawkish senator warned that there would be ' hell to pay ' if @entity10 or its proxies were responsible for downing a passenger plane ' this was an airliner headed towards @entity10 airspace , ' the @entity248 @entity247 said on @entity252			1
' and it has the earmarks – and i 'm not concluding – but it has the earmarks of a mistaken identification of an aircraft that they may have believed was @entity7			2
' ' if that 's true , this is a horrible tragic event which was certainly unanticipated by anybody no matter who they are			0
and there will be incredible repercussions if this is the case			0
' ' if it is the result of either separatist or @entity10 actions mistakenly believing that this is a @entity7 warplane , ' @entity231 warned , ' i think there 's going to be hell to pay and there should be			1
' the senator 's comments came as recovery workers began to pick through mounds of luggage , airplane sections and even human remains in a nine - mile debris field where the @entity54 went down thursday			0
a @entity10 ' @entity140 ' air defense missile like this one is believed to have shot down @entity6 flight 17 , with @entity10 and @entity7 pointing fingers of blame at each other he also told host @entity290 that president @entity2 has mishandled the @entity7 crisis by going soft on @entity10 president @entity64 and refusing to arm @entity7 government forces			1
' the @entity1 – it has been insulting in how small and how little help we have given , ' he complained			2
' i mean , they have been begging us for defensive weaponry [ but ] we have not given it to them			0
' @entity231 also slammed the @entity32 for the shallowness of economic sanctions the @entity1 has pushed on @entity12 after @entity64 annexed a region of @entity7 that was populated mainly by ethnic @entity10			1
' the sanctions so far in exchange for @entity306 have been minuscule , ' said @entity231			0
' these latest enacted by the @entity2 administration , i think , are helpful			0
but if you ask the @entity7 government that 's struggling , they said they need weapons [ with ] which to defend themselves			1
' earlier in the day @entity231 went directly after @entity64 , telling @entity313 that if the plane was fired on by ' separatists , which are also @entity10 , @entity64 should be paying a heavy price			1
' wreckage : firefighters contained blazes at the site of the crash near the town of @entity322 , in rebel - held east @entity7 @entity64 on thursday called the idea of @entity10 government involvement in the plane 's destruction ' stupidity ' and blamed @entity7			1
' this tragedy would not have occurred if there was peace in that land , ' he said , at least if hostilities had not resumed in the southeast of @entity7			0
' ' and without question , the state over whose territory this took place bears responsibility for this awful tragedy			0
' @entity1 officials said thursday that they are certain the passenger plane was shot down by a @entity10 - made surface - to - air missile			1
the @entity345 reported that @entity347 - era ' @entity140 ' missile systems have been spotted in an area of eastern @entity7 controlled by separatist fighters			2
@entity350 surfaced on friday showing that specific anti-aircraft weapon system being hauled into @entity10			2
the apparatus was missing two of its four missiles .			0

@entity1 president warns @entity64 that he knows support for militant groups in @entity7 have had ' a steady stream of support from @entity10 '
but he stopped short of language @entity70 used – she said friday that the @entity1 should ' put @entity64 on notice '
@entity2 warned that the @entity1 could ' increase the costs we impose on them ' via economic sanctions , ' and we will do so '
@entity10 's president has called the idea of involvement by his government or its proxies ' stupidity '
@entity2 identified a single @entity1 citizen who he said was on the flight
he addressed the missile attack on @entity6 flight 17 nearly 24 hours after his *disastrously* *flippant* and brief remarks on thursday
