air crash investigators searching for @entity1 hope to further narrow down the planned search area to find the doomed @entity3 within the next year			1
the aircraft vanished on march 8 with 239 passengers and crew on board after it departed @entity8 in @entity9 to @entity10 in @entity11			0
over the past six months , international experts searched for the aircraft using a range of data in a bid to narrow down the crash site			1
@entity35 of the @entity36 is leading the search and feels confident that he will be able to announce a smaller search area shortly based on satellite data and the use of flight simulators			1
he said new seabed surveys have also produced some interesting findings including hard objects that seem inconsistent with their surroundings , although there is no guarantee that this is the aircraft			0
he told @entity49 : ' there is nothing that has screamed out and said " i look like an aircraft "			0
' it 's still a hell of an area			0
the area is horribly , horribly complicated			0

' the complexities surrounding the search can not be understated			2
it involves vast areas of the @entity71 with only limited known data and aircraft flight information			2
' while it is impossible to determine with certainty where the aircraft may have entered the water , all the available data indicates a highly probable search area close to a long but narrow arc of the southern @entity71			2
' the search will be a major undertaking			0
the complexities and challenges involved are immense , but not impossible			1
' the best minds from around the world have been reviewing , refining and localising the most likely area where the aircraft entered the water , which is why we remain confident of finding the aircraft			0
' last month the @entity9 and @entity20 governments signed a memorandum of understanding where they both agreed to fund the renewed search effort .			1

experts have spent six months remapping the sea floor to help searchers
