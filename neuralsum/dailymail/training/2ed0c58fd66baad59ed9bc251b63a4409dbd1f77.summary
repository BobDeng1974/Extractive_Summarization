the preparations for war are over			0
my pilot , @entity4 , and i are sitting at the threshold of the runway in a fully - armed @entity8 bomber			1
outside it is pitch black , the dead of night			0
all the doubts and fears i ’ve battled in the past few weeks begin to recede as we prepare for the technical practicalities of modern warfare			2
@entity16 , weapons , fuel , defensive systems , flight controls — everything is checked , double checked , and then checked again			2
glancing around the gloomy airfield i can see the flashing lights of myriad aircraft , their crews carefully going through the endless procedures that will make a dangerous mission as risk - free as possible			2
beneath us , the awesome power of the jet bucks and strains to be released as @entity4 winds up the engines to maximum power			1
i glance over to the aircraft on our right and give a friendly wave through the darkness			0
i ca n’t see if my friend responds			0
it is the early hours of january 17 , 1991 , the first night of the first @entity59 war in @entity41 , and there is no turning back from whatever the coming hours hold for us			1
of course we are nervous , but we are also ready and there is no time for fear			0
we have been trained for this moment and we are determined to succeed , to prove ourselves in battle , and to survive ... scenes like this one — which is still seared in my memory — may be unfolding in the @entity71 just a few hours from now as our armed forces prepare , once again , to go to war			2
the horrific footage of @entity76 terrorist fighters beheading innocent hostages has goaded the @entity78 into action , and a coalition of nations is already striking @entity83 targets from the air			2
and where @entity78 deploys the ‘ big stick ’ , its staunch ally @entity85 normally follows			1
our military personnel — mostly young men and women — have been ordered on to a war footing and it is highly likely the @entity93 will soon join the fray against the jihadists in @entity41			1
bags are being packed , wills reviewed , children and loved ones will be hugged more closely than usual			0
it will only take a debate in @entity102 today to seal the decision to send our war planes over @entity41 again			1
the prospect of battle is perhaps only hours away , so how will those involved be feeling ? i can clearly remember my emotions in the build - up to @entity111 — the operation to liberate @entity113 — in 1991			1
the predictable worry and uncertainty was mixed with a sense of anticipation , even excitement			0
@entity119 is the job i had been trained for , so there is a sense of wanting to test oneself to the full			0
for me the sense of destiny was very real : the world was watching events unfold on its tv screens in much the same way we are today			2
to be part of history on this scale felt electrifying			2
as our commander put it , we were going to be the ‘ thunder and lightning ’ of @entity111			1
but , at the same time , there was a real sense of trepidation			0
my @entity8 squadron was based on the island of @entity144 and on the eve of the war to evict @entity148 ’s troops from @entity113 , the tension on our base was palpable			1
i needed to get away , to collect my thoughts , so i went for a jog along the coast			0
my abiding memory of that time is of sitting on the rocks , staring out to sea and contemplating that i may not have long to live			0
my two young nieces had sent me a cassette tape and , as i listened to their innocent voices telling me of the excitement of birthdays and the presents they had received , it was hard to suppress my tears			0
i had prepared for the practicalities of war , including a will to be made			0
but the hardest thing was to write the ‘ last letters ’ that would be delivered to loved ones only if the worst happened			1
it is an almost impossibly poignant task to tell them that if they are actually reading that letter then you will not be coming home — ever			2
visit @entity176 speaker bureau @entity4 , mr @entity42 's pilot			1
the pair were finally released after seven weeks but were subject to beatings , mock executions and being paraded on tv how do you explain that no matter how much it hurts they must be strong and get on with the rest of their lives ? how do you express the depth of your love in a letter that you hope will never be read ? there was also a real eagerness , perhaps even desperation , to get into combat			1
yet i remember feeling sick when i thought about what the coming hours might bring			0
i was about to fight and possibly die			0
but the thought at the forefront of my mind was not ‘ will i survive ? ’ , it was ‘ i just hope i do n’t let my mates down			1
’ the other thought was about capture and possible torture — and perhaps this is a consideration high on the minds of those preparing to go to war again there today			1
@entity148 had ordered his people to tear any captured aircrew ‘ limb from limb ’			1
@entity4 , my friend as well as my pilot , and i had agreed that if we were faced with the enemy , rather than being captured , we would provoke a shoot - out which would result in our deaths , perhaps taking a few of them with us			1
we hoped we would never have to test the theory			0
days after that conversation , we were screaming over our target at around 600mph , just 50ft above the desert , and turning to head back to base			2
our bombing mission had been a dismal failure and we were returning dejected , wondering what our mates would say about making a cock - up of our very first mission			2
suddenly , a heat - seeking surface - to - air missile slammed into the right - hand engine of our jet			1
it was like being hit by an express train			2
as the titanium - laced missile warhead exploded , the 30 - ton jet was blasted sideways like a leaf in the wind , moments later , as the plane blew up in flames , i keyed the transmit button on the radio , ‘ ejecting , ejecting ’			1
as the ejection seat rockets fired it was like being grabbed by a giant hand and thrown into the middle of a cauldron of fire , gales , confusion and fear			0
seconds later , the parachute deployed and i was on the ground in the heart of the enemy desert			1
it was an overwhelming sensation and i wanted to sit down and let circumstances wash over me — to let someone else take control			2
but you ca n’t just give up , you have to continue the fight until all the options are exhausted			0
@entity4 and i were on the run in the desert for a couple of hours before shots rang out and the sand around us was blasted by a hail of bullets			1
we were now faced with the terrible dilemma we had always feared			2
fight and die ? or surrender ? i can still see @entity4 turning towards me saying , ‘ there ’s always hope ’			1
we put our guns down and were captured			2
i truly thought i might die in those first few seconds as the @entity41 soldiers beat us to the ground in blind rage			1
luckily , an officer managed to calm them down and we were loaded onto a vehicle			0
the sense of fear and desperation was coursing through me , but i still held out hope of survival			0
my fear was heightened as a young @entity289 boy who had guided the soldiers to our position began to draw his finger across his throat in a slitting motion			2
the immediate future looked bleak			0
we were taken to @entity45 , and the brutality of those weeks of capture was terrible — beatings , mock executions , cigarettes stubbed out on our skin , and of course , being humiliatingly paraded on tv			1
but there was also hope — yes it would have been easy for them to kill us , indeed one of @entity148 ’s sons apparently ordered that we should be shot			1
we always had hope that we might survive and be reunited with our loved ones			0
and eventually , after seven weeks , we were			0
after a short and successful campaign , the allied coalition won and we were released to the @entity313			1
as today ’s generation of young men and women prepare to take to the skies in anger once again over @entity41 , the terrible prospect of capture after being shot down must be at the forefront of their thoughts			1
but this time it is even more chilling — for the brutal , public murder of @entity83 hostages by beheading is well understood by all involved			1
these are highly trained professionals , however , and any concerns in their minds will be pushed aside			0
it may sound inane to outsiders , but fears for one ’s own fate are daily realities for modern military people			1
they know the risks , they understand the dangers			0
but they can not , will not , let those concerns influence their actions			0
just as i was paid to do the job 24 years ago , so they have taken the ‘ @entity351 ’s shilling ’ to carry out their orders today			1
they will want to test themselves in battle , they will want to fight bravely , they will not want to let their mates down			0
that is the very ethos of military life			0
and whatever trials and hardships the coming days bring our armed forces , i know they will acquit themselves with courage , dignity and professionalism			0
as a country , we can be justifiably proud of them .			0
