by @entity0 published : 08:10 est , 12 october 2012 updated : 09:36 est , 14 october 2012 a spinoff from robotic space technology may someday help astronauts stay fit in space and help paraplegics walk on @entity7 , @entity1 says			1
the @entity9 space agency and the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) have jointly developed a robotic exoskeleton called @entity12			1
the 57lb device is a robot that a human could wear over his or her body either to assist or inhibit movement in leg joints			0
it is based on the technology behind @entity29 2 , the first humanoid robot in space in the inhibit mode , the @entity12 exoskeleton would be used as an in - space exercise machine to supply resistance against leg movement			1
the same technology could be used in reverse on the ground , potentially helping some individuals walk for the first time			2
the @entity12 is based on the technology behind @entity29 2 , the first humanoid robot in space , which is currently working with astronauts aboard the @entity44			1
' robotics is playing a key role aboard the @entity44 and will be critical in our future human exploration of deep space , ' said @entity50 , director of @entity1 's @entity51			1
' what 's extraordinary about space technology and our work with projects like @entity29 are the unexpected possibilities space tech spinoffs may have right here on @entity7			1
' it 's exciting to see a @entity1 - developed technology might one day help people with serious ambulatory needs to begin to walk again , or even walk for the first time			2
' that 's the sort of return on investment @entity1 is proud to give back to @entity9 and the world			0
' @entity1 's @entity29 2 aboard the @entity44 : the technology for the @entity12 exoskeleton was adapted from the @entity29 project from the waist up , 27 - year - old @entity70 is every inch the pretty blonde girl - next - door			1
but from the waist down , with her legs encased in £ 90,000 of motorised carbon - fibre , she is @entity77			0
@entity70 ’s thumb manipulates a joystick built into the armrests of her suit , causing the legs to hiss and whirr into life , before she takes three slow but sure steps			0
her face breaks into a broad grin			0
@entity1 's @entity12 prototype is not the only exoskeleton in development that could help disabled people walk again			1
@entity70 is one of the first people in the world to benefit from a robotic exoskeleton called @entity94			0
once in , the only movement needed is the strength to operate a small joystick , which instructs 29 micro-controllers within the machine to react within milliseconds			0
the user can move in all directions , sit down , and ascend and descend stairs			0
it is this technology that will , arguably , mark the end of the wheelchair			0
but as yet there are currently just ten in existence and only 30 people have tried @entity94			0
@entity94 weighs nearly 6st and is relatively bulky , yet experts predict that within the next few decades the devices will be small and light enough to slip on under a pair of jeans			0
worn over the legs , with a harness that reaches up the back and around the shoulders , @entity12 has four motorised joints at the hips and the knees , and six passive joints that allow for sidestepping , turning and pointing , and flexing a foot			1
there also are multiple adjustment points , allowing the @entity12 to be used in many different ways			1
@entity1 is examining the potential for the @entity12 as an exercise device to improve crew health both aboard the space station and during future long - duration missions to an asteroid or @entity135			1
without taking up valuable space or weight during missions , @entity12 could replicate common crew exercises , which are vital to keeping astronauts healthy in zero gravity			1
in addition , the device has the ability to measure , record and stream back data in real - time to flight controllers on @entity7 , giving doctors better insight into the crew 's exercise			0
@entity12 could also provide a robotic power boost to astronauts as they work on the surface of distant planetary bodies			1
coupled with a spacesuit , @entity12 could provide additional force when needed during surface exploration			1
here on @entity7 , @entity10 is interested in developing and using @entity12 as an assistive walking device			2
it has the potential to produce high torques to allow for assisted walking over varied terrain , as well as stair climbing			0
' we greatly value our collaboration with @entity1 , ' said @entity166 , @entity10 's director and ceo			0
' the @entity12 's high - performance capabilities will enable @entity10 to continue performing cutting - edge research in mobility assistance and expand into rehabilitation			2
' the potential of @entity12 extends to other applications , including rehabilitation , gait modification and offloading large amounts of weight from the wearer			2
preliminary studies by @entity10 have already shown @entity12 to be more comfortable , easier to adjust , and easier to put on than older exoskeleton devices			2
researchers now plan on improving on the @entity12 design by adding more active joints to areas such as the ankle and hip to increase the potential uses for the device .			2

the @entity12 is based on the technology behind the @entity29 2 , which is now working with astronauts aboard the @entity44
