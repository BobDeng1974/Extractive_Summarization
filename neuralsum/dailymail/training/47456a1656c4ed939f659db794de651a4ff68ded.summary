murder : @entity11 , left , has been jailed for life over the killing of @entity12 , right @entity11 , 30 , denied murder - but a court heard that he had stolen the rolling pin days earlier from the @entity25 naval base in @entity26 , @entity27 where he worked as a galley assistant			1

' you produced the rolling pin from your rucksack and you bludgeoned @entity12 to death with it			1
' she was sat on the sofa in her dressing gown and pyjamas when the attack started and she never moved other than to fall side ways under the blows you rained on her head			0
couple : the killing was motivated by @entity11 's desire to gain sole custody of the couple 's daughter ' it was an appalling and murderous attack			2

' you have deprived @entity14 of her mother and you have deprived @entity12 of the joys of bringing up her child			2
you have deprived those near and dear to @entity12 of a young woman who everybody spoke of in a warm and affectionate capacity			0

a series of @entity88 messages were read to the court in which ms @entity12 claimed her ex-partner wanted sole custody and intended to make her a ' weekend mum '			2
planned : @entity11 took a rolling pin from his workplace days before murdering his ex-girlfriend @entity11 discovered that ms @entity12 was in a relationship with another man by reading her email , and the prosecution claimed he planned to use the information as evidence during a custody hearing			1
' you were digging for dirt to use against @entity12 , ' mr @entity102 said			0
' you thought that might help you in the custody battle with @entity12 after @entity14			1
' you said the way she dressed and the fact she was a " slag " would count against her			0
you told her , " you dress in a provocative way and have sex with other men , that means i will get @entity14 , " did n't you ? ' @entity11 had been brandishing a rolling pin in front of colleagues in the days before the killing , and talked about murder and suicide in what mr @entity102 described as a ' rehearsal '			1
on april 4 , 2012 , he bludgeoned ms @entity12 over the head and killed her , before leaving home and returning hours later to ' play the part of the bereaved boyfriend ' in front of police			2
