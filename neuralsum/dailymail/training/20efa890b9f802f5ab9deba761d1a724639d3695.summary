@entity1 coach @entity0 has hit back at @entity3 boss @entity2 by claiming @entity4 is the ' best full back in the world '			1
the 26 - year - old was a regular under previous coach @entity8 , starting six of seven games at the @entity10 this summer			1
but @entity4 has not made a single appearance under @entity2 , who blamed his attacking instincts for contributing to their 7 - 1 humiliation by @entity15 in the semi-final			1
@entity17 ( left ) , @entity4 ( centre ) and @entity20 warm - up on thursday but @entity0 said : ' @entity3 did n't have a good @entity10 , but i do n't think it was because of @entity4			1
the team in general did n't play well			2
' since the @entity10 , @entity4 has been the best full - back in the world without a doubt			1
we are happy if he does n't join up with his national team and stays here			2
' @entity1 face @entity30 in @entity31 on friday aiming to extend their record winning run to 20 matches but injuries are beginning to take their toll			2
@entity0 's side will be chasing their 20th successive victory against @entity30 on friday @entity0 's side have been in blistering form and a 4 - 0 victory over @entity42 in the @entity43 on tuesday set a new @entity45 record of 19 wins in all competitions			0
injuries are becoming a concern , however , with @entity50 going off against @entity51 last weekend to join @entity52 and @entity53 in the treatment room			1
@entity55 has earned a chance to claim a regular place in the side but the team are looking stretched in midfield with @entity61 having joined @entity62 in the last transfer window			2
@entity65 @entity64 slaloms his way through @entity1 training on thursday afternoon ' we are waiting to see how well @entity52 and @entity50 recover and then we will take a decision after @entity71 , ' coach @entity0 told a news conference on thursday			1
' @entity55 has come in and has done well and can play in different positions in the midfield			0
( @entity76 ) @entity75 can also play in different roles but at the moment there is no need to move him from where he is in the centre			0
' real lead the @entity31 table with 36 points from 14 games and @entity0 believes it is important for them to beat @entity30 and keep their confidence high before they travel to play in the @entity89 in @entity90 next week			0
' it is an honour to train this team and the record shows that we are playing well			0
there are no trophies but it gives you belief , ' @entity0 said			0
' we have been looking ahead to the @entity89 and making plans			0
whatever happens in the next few games though it has been a fantastic year for @entity1 and we want to finish it on a high note			0

the *defender* was a regular under previous coach @entity8
