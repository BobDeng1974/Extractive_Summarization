but it was n’t for an @entity11 holiday jolly around the exhibits			0
it was to help him rule in the case of an ancient statue which is said to have be smuggled out of war - torn @entity4			1
the trial centres on a businessman who claimed in paper work that the treasure was a statue for home decoration			1
experts , however say the @entity26 marble figure – which is thought to depict @entity27 , goddess of the underworld – was looted from a world heritage site			1
while the man who had it delivered to a warehouse in @entity34 claimed it was about 100 years old and worth around £ 75,000 , they say it is worth £ 2million and dates from the third to first centuries @entity38 they claim it was intended for the lucrative private market in classical antiquities			1
