from matching tattoos of the @entity2 and the @entity3 to bizarre banana body art , couples are taking their love to new heights by getting matching etchings			1
but as an entertaining post on @entity12 website @entity9 revealed , tattoos - for - two do n't always go to plan			1
among the etchings that have caused regret since being added in the throes of early love or lust are green and red light sabres , a married pair with the words ' i do ' and ' ditto ' inked onto their fingers and another couple who thought nothing said love quite like a pair of avocados sketched on their arms			1
bananas ! one couple found a fruity - and permanent - way to show their love for one another let 's hope they stay together ! this couple say they 're soulmates ... in permanent ink @entity41 romance : this pair 's love apparently involves drinking to death , as their skull and cross-bottles show home , sweet home : the sentiment is lovely			1
sadly for this couple , the tattoos are not locked up : she 's got the key to his heart according to this unsightly pair of matching tattoos equally regrettable are the couple who got interlocked hearts etched onto their bodies			1
apart , the inkings look like abstract lines , with the full glory of the tattoos only becoming apparent when their arms are locked together			0
other bizarre tattoos include the pair for whom death by alcohol equals romance			2
their matching tattoos show a skull and crossbones , with the bones exchanged for gin bottles			2
although the tattooed twosomes boast some particularly awful examples , they 're by no means alone in their mutual passion for ink			0
@entity86 and her former husband @entity87 got matching blue and pink dice tattoos , but both had them lasered off following their divorce			0
puzzling : this couple decided to get a matching pair of jigsaw pieces etched onto their ankles is the force with them ? a pair of @entity99 inspired light sabres ( left ) and matching avocados ( right ) fellow @entity104 enfant terrible , @entity102 , also got a tattoo to celebrate her love for @entity108 @entity107 - who returned the favour - but once again , the laser was required after the pair broke up			1
even @entity112 has been caught out by the tattoo trend			0
former love @entity114 inked a portrait of her face on his neck , although may have to cover it up as the couple have now split			2
one couple who have n't had to call in the laser specialists are happily married showbiz couple , @entity123 and @entity124 , who showed their love by getting ' iv ' inked onto their index fingers			0
subtle : @entity124 and @entity123 have discreet ' iv ' tattoos on their wedding ring fingers not a good look : @entity86 and @entity87 ( pictured ) got matching pink and blue dice tattoos dodgy doodle : this couple chose romantic interlocked hearts that look like doodles when they 're apart in the beginning was the word ... which ended up as a tattoo ( right ) while sightseeing inspired those to the left			0

tattoos - for - two include a skull and cross-bottles , bananas and avocados
other couples plumped for *declarations* of love etched in permanent ink
@entity112 and @entity114 are an *a-list* pair who got matching marks
