@entity0 and @entity1 spend hundreds of millions on world - class footballers as freely as kids buy candyfloss as the seaside			1
at some stage of their careers the majority of the game ’s greatest players cross the portals of the @entity13 or the @entity14 , in some cases both			2
cometh the latest edition of @entity17 in @entity0 this saturday , cometh the hour for plucking from the pantheons of @entity20 ’s gigantes their most wondrous teams of all - time			2
@entity1 stars ( from left to right ) @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 give @entity29 ( centre ) a lift during training ahead of @entity17 the problem with this embarrassment of riches is as much who to leave out as who to put in			2
@entity40 , the original @entity39 phenomenon , does not make it into my @entity42 @entity40 , @entity0 ’s modern @entity45 marvel , is one of less than a handful of current players in both teams put together			0
for every genius chosen , a maestro has to be left out			0
inevitably the @entity0 selection is predicated on the greatest club side in history , that which won the first five @entity55 cups with the immortal @entity56 and @entity57 as its axis			2
our fantasy @entity0 and @entity61 - scroll down for who we think would win this encounter history weighs a little less heavily on @entity1 , leaving scope for balance down the ages , yet still no room for @entity69 , @entity70 or any of the other 2010 @entity72 winners let the arguments begin			1
@entity0 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) @entity74 – coming to a reluctant end now but the no 1 keeper for @entity0 and @entity20 virtually since his @entity0 debut at the age of 18 and the one - man saviour of transitional @entity0 teams in several of those seasons			2
@entity74 dives and makes a save during @entity0 's 3 - 0 @entity84 win over @entity85 @entity86 – @entity88 , as he was born , won five successive @entity90 championship medals in just one of the segments of his 16 years as @entity0 ’s peerless right back @entity94 – the giant @entity96 rock at the defensive heart of the @entity55 legends of the late 50s and early 60s			1
@entity94 ( in white ) challenges @entity100 's @entity99 ( left ) and ( right ) full back @entity86 @entity101 – the midfield enforcer turned iron - man defender who scored almost as many goals as he prevented , 127 of them in 601 appearances @entity107 – another 600 - plus games man			0
winner of seven @entity109 and a @entity84 in 16 seasons at the @entity13			0
far more beloved and effective than @entity112 ’s hit - and - miss free - kick cult left back @entity114			0
@entity101 ( left ) challenges @entity116 star @entity115 in 1998 real skipper @entity107 ( left ) shakes hands with @entity119 captain @entity118 prior to their @entity121 quarter - final second leg at the @entity13 in 1985 - the @entity123 side won 1 - 0 @entity40 – having finally de-throned @entity23 as world footballer of the year , @entity40 tales his place in the legend			1
he does so having just scored more goals in one season than any other @entity130 – and as he is threatening to improve on that record			0
@entity132 – perhaps the finest player of his generation , probably the best @entity135 footballer ever , remembered for ever for the most sublime of all his works of art – that stupendous volley in @entity0 ’s winning of the 2002 @entity84 final @entity40 ( centre ) scores his sublime first goal for @entity0 against @entity85 on wednesday @entity132 scores one of the most famous @entity84 final goals of all time in 2002 @entity56 – the king above all @entity0 ’s princes as playmaker and goal - taker in the founding legend of the @entity84 ; still among the five best players of all time ; anointed by most of the others in that celestial company as the most complete footballer ever @entity154 ( @entity156 ) @entity155 – the third man alongside @entity56 and @entity57 in the magnficent @entity84 triumvirate			1
the only man to win six @entity55 cups and 12 @entity90 titles			0
deadly in front of goal			0
@entity56 ( right ) nets in the famous 7 - 3 @entity84 final thrashing of @entity168 in 1960 @entity170 training in the unlikely venue of @entity173 's @entity172 before the 1960 @entity84 final @entity175 – @entity0 ’s all - time high scorer with 323 goals in a club record 741 games played over the 16 seasons in which he won six @entity90 titles and three @entity84 winners ’ medals ( the competition in which he is still top scorer ) , to become a favourite son of the @entity13			1
@entity57 – @entity189 ’s revolutionary galloping major took @entity123 football by storm , scoring an astounding 242 goals , many of them created by @entity56 , in 262 appearances for @entity0			1
the only man to score hat - tricks in two @entity84 finals , the first in the historic 7 - 3 victory over @entity201 in @entity202			0
@entity57 ( centre ) bags @entity0 's fifth goal in their demolition of @entity201 at @entity207 @entity1 ( 4 - 1 - 3 - 2 ) @entity209 - @entity20 ’s no 1 pre @entity74 , and kept immaculate goal through more than 400 appearances for @entity1 , including the club ’s first winning of the @entity84 in 1992			1
@entity214 – @entity42 captain supreme ; played 581 games before retiring this may ; led them to six @entity90 titles and three @entity84 glories ; fearsome centre back but also a redoubtable right back and is there to help balance this defence @entity209 ( left ) , a stalwart in the @entity1 goal , punches clear against @entity223 in 1998 @entity214 ( right ) leaps to challenge @entity225 's @entity224 in a @entity84 semi-final in 2012 ' @entity227 ' , @entity228 ( right ) a fixture at the heart of the @entity1 defence for years @entity228 – not called ‘ @entity227 ’ for nothing			1
snuffed out most of the best forwards in the world through almost 500 games for @entity1 – yet as creative from the back as he was uncompromising tin the challenge			2
@entity238 – who else to play alongside ‘ @entity227 ’ but ‘ @entity240 ’ , as @entity241 was dubbed			0
another iron man with deft touch , @entity238 played 620 games over 20 seasons with @entity42 – much of one of them with a broken collar bone in the extra-time winning of the 1979 @entity84 - @entity250 ’ cup final			0
@entity252 – the perfectly balanced left - back who defended as solidly as he answered @entity256 ’s crie - de - couer for @entity257 attacking football @entity238 ( left ) , dubbed @entity240 , holds off @entity260 during a @entity17 - he was a hard - man defender @entity261 – in his first incarnation at the @entity14 , before filing his credentials as one of the great managers , @entity261 was the ideal midfield anchorman , reading the game as brilliantly as you would now expect , shutting down danger at its source and starting attacks @entity23 – the brilliant @entity271 , after @entity272 the great @entity271			1
@entity23 has failed to place a @entity275 - like @entity274 hand on the @entity72 but his electrifying runs and barrel - loads of goals have propelled @entity1 to glory in recent seasons – and himself to multiple @entity281 and @entity283 awards			1
like @entity40 , a legend in his own time			0
@entity261 , in his first @entity1 incarnation as a midfielder , against @entity287 in 1992 a legend in his own time , @entity23 has consistently produced barnstorming performances for @entity42 @entity272 – the second greatest footballer ever made not much more than a pit - stop in @entity291 but his virtuoso brilliance and wonder goals can not be left out of any all - time team for which he qualifies @entity256 – the genius who orchestrated @entity297 for @entity298 and @entity299 and went on to conduct @entity1 to honours as both player and manager			1
another of the all - time top five who simply has to be in this line - up two geniuses of the @entity14 , @entity256 ( left ) and the @entity274 master @entity272 @entity307 – sometimes known as @entity308 , this @entity189 giant of the late 40s , 50s and early 60s was to @entity42 what @entity57 was to @entity0 – a goal machine harnessed to magical touch with his passing			1
scorer of 194 in 256 matches spanning a decade at @entity1 , he was the first striker in the world to perfect the art of bending free kicks round and over defensive walls – with that heavy old ball to boot			2
a forgotten hero in some quarters – but not here			0
@entity325 – not unlike @entity326 , this @entity39 enigma was the best player on the planet – for a while			0
the ball - conjuring skills were as captivating as that beaming smile and all his four most enchanted club seasons were his gift to @entity1 , whom he insired to @entity84 glory as well as @entity90 titles while being twice elected @entity340			1
@entity325 celebrates scoring against away at @entity342 during his time at @entity1 in february 2008 this leaves us with just one question to answer : who would have won			0
for my pesetas @entity0 ’s extra width plus the telepathy between @entity350 and @entity57 would give them the edge in this 10 - goal spectacular : @entity0 6 @entity1 4 @entity57 ( 2 ) @entity355 @entity356 @entity357 ronaldo @entity325 zidane			2

@entity0 against @entity1 is one of the most keenly - *contested* games in world football
the @entity90 giants do *battle* at the @entity13 this *weekend*
likes of @entity272 , @entity23 , @entity132 and @entity56 have *excelled* in the fixture
