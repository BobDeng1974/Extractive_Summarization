it could be the perfect excuse for lying in on monday morning			0
getting up for work after the clocks go forward can be bad for your health , according to scientists			1
a team from the @entity7 were studying the impact of daylight saving on a person 's health			0
monday morning blues : professor @entity13 said clocks going forward could raise your heart attack risk they found that the abrupt change to a person 's daily schedule increased the risk of having a heart attack by 10 per cent			1
this impact is n't felt on the sunday morning as most people adapt their weekend schedule and rise a little later			2
however , the risk peaks on monday when workers have to get up at a set time to get to the office			2
when the clocks go back in october the risk of heart attack decreases by 10 per cent			1
' exactly why this happens is not known but there are several theories , ' said professor @entity13			0
' sleep deprivation , the body 's circadian clock and immune responses all can come into play when considering reasons that changing the time by an hour can be detrimental to someone 's health			0
' wake up 30 minutes earlier on saturday and sunday than you need to in preparation for the early start on monday eat a decent - sized breakfast go outside in the sunlight in the early morning exercise in the mornings over the weekend everyone in @entity54 will need to prepare to lose an hour this sunday as clocks move forward on march 11			1
however @entity56 have longer to prepare as summertime starts two weeks later in the @entity56 with clocks moving forward in the early hours of march 25			1
professor @entity13 said night owls would need to take particular care as they have a more difficult time with ' springing forward			2
' he added : ' people who are sleep - deprived weigh more and are at an increased risk of developing diabetes or heart disease			1
sleep deprivation also can alter other body processes , including inflammatory response , which can contribute to a heart attack			1
' time changes also affect the body 's circadian rhythm , which ' stresses ' the body cells as they struggle to adjust			0
professor @entity13 said : ' the internal clocks in each cell can prepare it for stress or a stimulus			2
when time moves forward , cell clocks are anticipating another hour to sleep that they wo n't get , and the negative impact of the stress worsens ; it has a much more detrimental effect on the body			1
' he added that the immune system can also receive a knock as immune cells also have internal clocks			0
he pointed to animal studies that found mice given a certain level of toxin died if they had been subjected to a ' daylight savings time ' effect , but survived if their routine was not changed			0
it can take a few days to synch your circadian rhythm to a changing environment everyone eventually synchs with their environment however professor @entity13 says you can ease yourself into monday morning by waking up half an hour earlier than normal on the weekend before and catch some sunlight in the morning			0
' doing this will help reset both the central , or master , clock in the brain that reacts to changes in light / dark cycles , and the peripheral clocks - the ones everywhere else , including the one in the heart - that react to food intake and physical activity			1
' this will enable your body to naturally synch with the change in the environment , which may lessen your chance of adverse health issues on monday , ' he said			0
while the study uncovered an association between lost sleep and heart risks , it did not prove a cause - and - effect relationship .			0

' abrupt ' change to daily schedule increases risk of heart attack by 10 *%*
clocks spring forward on march 11 in @entity54 and march 25 in @entity56
