want to explore space like never before ? now you can , thanks to an ultra-realistic space simulator that reveals the universe in glorious hd			2
called @entity5 , the simulation of the entire known cosmos lets you visit planets , stars , galaxies and more			1
there are more than 130,000 objects in the game which includes all known exoplanets , more than 10,000 galaxies and our own solar system			1
it has taken @entity23 to put @entity5 together			1
the software is free although he is currently seeking donations on his site			1
in the simulator players can explore all known planets , stars and galaxies reported by @entity31 , @entity5 is available to download now for pc - and as an added bonus , there 's no cost to download it			1
according to the official website it is ‘ a free space simulation program that lets you explore the universe in three dimensions , from planet earth to the most distant galaxies			1

‘ millions of galaxies , trillions of stars , countless planets - all available for exploration			2
you can land [ on ] any planet , moon or asteroid and watch alien landscapes and celestial phenomena			0
’ the creator of the game , @entity23 from @entity71 in @entity72 , told @entity73 that it took him eight years to put the simulator together			1
‘ i do it in my free time , but recently i moved to full - time development thanks to donations on the @entity5 site , ’ he says			1
‘ the team is only me , however many users help me in making and moderating the site , making ship models and soundtracks for @entity5 , because i am only a programmer , not an artist			2

mr @entity23 tells @entity73 that the planets and moons have accurately simulated orbits , using @entity138 textures and landscape data to show their surfaces			0
and for the universe as a whole he explains : ‘ all objects are generated using actual scientific knowledge			0
' he explains that he is only accepting donations for the software at the moment , but understandably plans to start charging for a future version that will be released on steam			0
