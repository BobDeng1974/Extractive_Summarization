by @entity1 reporter published : 12:04 est , 1 november 2012 updated : 12:29 est , 1 november 2012 locals in a small @entity4 town have come up with a novel alternative to installing a toilet in their cemetery - by building an outhouse that looks like an upright coffin			1
residents of @entity11 , @entity12 , opted to build the macabre toilet after the council put the brakes on moves to build a restroom because it would cost around $ 82,000			1
people from the town ’s @entity19 decided to take matters into their own hands and carve out a coffin - shaped pit stop for visitors of the cemetery			1
macabre : the @entity19 in @entity11 , @entity12 , decided to build this coffin - shaped toilet to save on buying one for the town 's cemetery the toilet is deliberately constructed to resemble an upright coffin , and even has the haunting letters ‘ rip ’ and a crucifix etched into one of the walls , according to the @entity37			1
@entity19 president @entity38 built the coffin over the past few months in his garage and it has recently been installed in the cemetery			1
‘ you have to be careful , not everyone is going to have our macabre sense of humour , ’ he told the @entity42 newspaper			2
‘ but we did it with good intentions			0
it 's for firstly , the cemetery , and secondly , maybe a few more people will notice @entity11 now			2
’ the coffin had been meticulously constructed and has sturdy walls and a solid cement foundation , as well as an inbuilt septic system			0
small town : @entity57 only has a modest population of 250 people but after complaints from some members of the 250 - strong community in @entity11 , coupled with the fact it was never approved by the council , whether or not the @entity66 toilet will stay is in the balance			1
its fate will likely be decided within the week			0
mayor of the @entity72 @entity71 said whether the toilet will stay in @entity11 will be discussed at the next meeting , according to cairns.com.au			1
she said : ‘ we 'll be discussing it in the next week and talking to our staff about what we can do			0
’ local @entity79 believes the toilet may not go down too well with residents , especially mourners at the cemetery			0
on the map : although some locals are against the toilet , others believe the quirky restroom has given the town its own identity he told @entity91 : ‘ imagine if they had a funeral there			2
’ ‘ i do n’t think it ’s going to go over very well , especially if people are there from out of town			0
‘ they ’ll think : “ what sort of place is this ? ” ’ but many are keen to keep the toilet , and believe it gives the small town on the east coast of the country an identity of its own			0
one @entity110 reader said : ‘ people need to lighten up and have a good laugh			0
think of it this way – it 's put @entity11 on the map			2

@entity19 in @entity11 , @entity12 , opted to build coffin - shaped toilet after being told new toilet would cost $ 82,000
toilet may be removed as it never received approval from council
