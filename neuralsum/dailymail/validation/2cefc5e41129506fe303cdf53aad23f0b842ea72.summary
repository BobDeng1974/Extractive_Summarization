@entity1 furniture giant @entity0 will produce 10,000 flat - pack shelters for the @entity3 as temporary homes for refugees across the world			1
the ' @entity8 ' units are to be rolled out on a mass scale following a successful trial in @entity11 and the borders of @entity13 , in 2013			1
it is hoped the flat - pack homes , which can built in four hours without the need for tools , will make desperate conditions more bearable for displaced families			2
in typical @entity0 fashion , the walls , roof , floors , door and windows all come flat packed in cardboard boxes , making them easy to transport			0
dwellers will be pleased the 17.5sqm shelters are twice as large as the current crop of refugee tents used by the @entity48 and can accommodate five or six people			2
@entity50 , chief of shelter and settlement at the @entity48 's refugee agency @entity3 , said they would improve the lives of tens of thousands of people			1
' the refugee housing unit is an exciting new development in humanitarian shelter and represents a much needed addition to the palette of sheltering options mobilized to assist those in need , ' he said			2
successful pilot : the flat - pack shelters , pictured here in @entity11 as part of a pilot , take four - hours to erect and do not need tools refuge : a displaced family stand by a shelter at the @entity24 refugee camp in northern @entity25 ' its deployment will ensure dramatic improvement to the lives of many people affected by crises			1
' refugee camps are typically overcrowded with temperatures in tents fluctuating between sweltering hot in the day time and freezing at night			1
the walls and roof are made from the lightweight polymer , @entity86 , laminated with thermal insulation , which clips straight onto the shelter 's steel pole frame			0
they are strong enough to withstand the harsh climates seen in refugee camps			1
the material was specially developed to allow daylight to penetrate the shelter during the day but also to trap light sources emitting from inside the tent			0
it also stops people from being able to see shadows inside the tent , addressing privacy issues			0
it should assist inhabitants to read , learn and engage at night time under artificial light			0
a lightweight insulated technical metallic textile is made with interlaced aluminium and polyolefin strips , designed to reflect heat from the sun during the day and stop the heat escaping from inside the tent at night			0
there is a solar panel on top , laminated on a thin plastic film , designed to generate electricity for a light and usb port inside the unit			2
but it is hoped the specially - designed shelters will bring an end to the grim conditions , with flexible solar panels on the roofs for power , and specially - made walls that can deflect heat during the day and retain it at night			1
at 1.75 metres high , they are tall enough for people to stand , and even have lockable doors , ventilation , solar panels , mosquito nets and lights			1
mr @entity50 said : ' the units comprise the best elements of a tent in that it 's pre-packed , of minimal weight and produced to core standards , but it also has a rigid , self - supporting frame and it provides more physical security and dignity for its occupants '			0
the shelters originally cost about £ 5,000 , three times more than a standard @entity3 tent , but are designed to last for at least three years in harsh climates , compared to a tent 's average lifespan of six months			0
the firm hopes they could be made for around £ 655 each once in mass production			0
@entity0 's philanthropist foundation helped to fund the original project while a @entity1 - based group called the @entity160 has been working with the @entity48 agency on the design			0
@entity163 , head of strategic planning and communications , at the @entity166 said they were proud to help the relief effort			0
easy to assemble : the shelters take about four hours to build and do not require tools home : one gentleman shows his spacious temporary home , both inside and out , at a refugee camp in northern @entity25			2
the shelters are set to help thousands when they go into mass production he said : ' putting refugee families and their needs at the heart of this project is a great example of how democratic design can be used for humanitarian value			1
' we are incredibly proud that the @entity8 is now available , so refugee families and children can have a safer place to call home			2
' elsewhere , the @entity191 is piloting a similar type of structure in a refugee camp in @entity195 where there are also a number of @entity13 families living in container homes provided by @entity201 donors .			1
