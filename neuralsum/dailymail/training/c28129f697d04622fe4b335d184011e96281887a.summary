by @entity0 @entity1 produced a performance to catch the eye of @entity4 as @entity6 ’s under 21 team thrashed @entity7 at the @entity8			1
the @entity10 star is trying to stake his claim as the man to lead @entity6 ’s line in the absence of the injured @entity15 and he did himself no harm here with an energetic performance full of flair and creativity			0
the only thing missing for @entity1 was a goal but that did n’t matter as a stunning @entity25 free - kick and a hat - trick from the outstanding @entity27 gave the @entity28 the @entity31 21 @entity30 points			1
it must have been a little surreal for the 22 - year - old playing in front of an audience of just 1,500 at the @entity8 two months after he dazzled out in @entity87			1
but he showed his maturity in an encouraging display and looked threatening every time he touched the ball			0
he could n’t resist the odd flick or step - over but the real highlight came when he slipped in @entity94 for his hat - trick goal with a lovely chipped through ball			0
it is a dead cert @entity4 will start with £ 30million summer signing @entity98 up front against @entity101 on sunday but the boss will be pleased @entity1 is in good touch and ready to step in , especially with @entity104 tipped to leave the club and @entity106 still unconvincing			1
full - back : @entity41 has his work cut out if he is to get ahead of @entity109 into the first team indeed , on this form , it might be worth throwing @entity27 into that mix too			2
the 18 - year - old has been impressive on a regular basis at this level for the past 18 months			0
@entity6 find themselves in the second division of the reformatted under 21 league but they showed plenty of class against a poor @entity7 side			2
@entity46 also made an appearance for 45 minutes in midfield as he continues his latest recovery from injury and there was a game too for forgotten man @entity128			0
it did n’t take long for the hosts to establish a lead and it came from a majestic swing of @entity25 ’s boot			0
everyone expected him to send the free - kick , wide on the left , into the middle but he went for goal and deceived goalkeeper @entity56 with his impudence			0
chance : @entity1 will want to prove himself while @entity15 is out injured 8min his first meaningful involvement - collects the ball in the middle , spreads it wide to @entity25 and gets it back			2
tries to lift the ball over the goalkeeper but it floats wide of the far post 11 @entity153 shimmy to the right to receive a ball from @entity41 and then play the right - back in - leads to a corner 16 calling out for the ball as he darts into the box but @entity25 ignores his run and shoots instead 21 good chest control on the edge of the box and a left - footed shot that is dragged wide of the mark 39 gets into a good forward position down the left - channel to roll a low ball in towards @entity27			2
cleared for a corner 40 bends a shot wide of the target after cutting in from the right - hand side 44 @entity176 down the right , step - over and then cuts back to play 60 - yard ball to other side 54 sparking run of step - overs to get past three @entity7 defenders before a tame side - footed shot that rolled wide 58 instigated a move deep in midfield , drives through the middle and then plays the ball out wide with the outside of the boot			2
leads to a chance for @entity25 , which is saved 69 played an excellent chipped ball to set @entity27 free inside the box , allowing the livewire striker to complete his hat - trick @entity1 ’s first real involvement came on eight minutes when , after trading passes with @entity25 , he lifted a shot that beat @entity200 but landed wide of the far post			1
@entity25 looked excellent and a swirling cross-cum - shot nearly caused more embarrassment for @entity200 , before @entity46 ’s hit from 20 yards took an awkward deflection and bounced just over			2
@entity27 found some space inside the box and fired off a shot that @entity200 clawed away , while @entity1 dragged a left - footed shot wide following a nice piece of chest control			1
a second @entity6 goal seemed inevitable and it arrived on the half - hour			0
@entity25 ’s corner caused all kinds of carnage and after @entity217 ’s shot had been repelled , the ball was work across for @entity27 to steer home			0
@entity28 captain @entity48 tested @entity200 early in the second half and the goalkeeper also used his legs to block a powerful @entity25 strike			0
but there was nothing the @entity7 defence could do about @entity27 as he lost his marker to score the third with a towering header from @entity41 ’s inviting cross			1
still they were n’t satisfied and @entity1 ’s lofted through pass for @entity27 to complete his treble with a composed low finish was the highlight of the evening			1
@entity7 did manage to pull one back when @entity59 sent a free header past @entity40 from a @entity238 cross and they gained another in stoppage time when @entity68 lifted a shot high into the corner			1
but it was @entity6 ’s night and for @entity4 , there were plenty of reasons for encouragement			0
celebrations : the @entity31 21 side celebrate @entity251 's goal at the @entity8 struggled : @entity27 has struggled to get in to the @entity6 first team but was on form against @entity7 @entity6 qualify again			1

@entity31 21s beat @entity256 21s 4 - 2 at the @entity8
@entity27 scored three for the @entity28 , @entity251 scored one
@entity59 and @entity68 scored for @entity7
@entity1 and @entity46 started
@entity1 performed well , proving to @entity4 he is an *option*
