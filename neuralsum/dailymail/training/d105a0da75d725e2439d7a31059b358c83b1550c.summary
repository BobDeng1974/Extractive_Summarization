since many hotel rooms sit empty during the day , it simply makes economical sense for them to be rented by the hour to weary travellers			1
while there is still a bit of a social stigma attached to booking rooms for a very short - term stay , there 's now a startup , called @entity11 , looking to change all that			2
according to the app , such booking schedules will likely appeal to business travellers looking to take a nap or work between meetings , while families may simply want a quiet place to wait for a flight with their kids			1
despite the stigma attached to booking hotel rooms during the day , @entity11 is aiming to change this but will the public embrace it ? speaking to @entity28 , @entity11 co-founder , @entity29 , said : ' we think there is a stigma in the industry and we 've structured the whole company around moving away from this			1
' we do n't sell hourly rates , ' he clarified			0
the new app allows weary travellers the ability to check in to a hotel for a block of time during the day the app 's co-founder explains that such an option is great for holidaying families en route to the airport instead , the app allows you to book a hotel for a block of hours , usually beginning in the morning and running through the afternoon or early evening			1
@entity29 also points out that the rates are about 40 per cent less than a normal rate on the room			0
' we do n't sell nights , so the conversion is actually [ booking ] commission free , ' @entity29 explained			0
' we 're the only sharing economy tool that drives business back to hotels			0
' such a feature would also benefit weary business travellers who are only in town for several hours not only that but the sleek and stylish app is actually extremely easy to use			2
