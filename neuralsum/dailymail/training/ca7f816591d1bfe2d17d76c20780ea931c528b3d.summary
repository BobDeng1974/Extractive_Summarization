’ @entity8 had the first inkling something was wrong on monday evening when she and @entity10 treated their bridesmaids to a meal			0

‘ me and @entity10 did n’t have a clue			0
we ’d been so busy with the wedding that we had n’t watched the tv much or seen the news			0
‘ we rang the bank and were told that the money would show in the account on tuesday , so we went ahead and made the booking because there would have been more than enough to cover the honeymoon			2
