the worst thing most people will get caught carrying at security is a bottle of water , but there are some passengers who attempt to sneak some dangerous and very bizarre items onto planes			2
the @entity9 ( @entity10 ) has its own @entity12 feed documenting the unusual items it confiscates from airport security checkpoints - and it certainly makes for interesting viewing			1
from passengers travelling with their beloved eels , to hiding knives in the most unlikely of places , the @entity9 shares it all with its 238,000 followers			1
though potentially harmless , this toy must be checked by explosive detection professionals , the @entity9 says discovered in a carry - on bag at the @entity27 in @entity28 , it 's hard to know what this odd - looking creature is			1
while it might be nothing more than a homourous novelty toy , @entity9 agents have no way of knowing if the grenade in its hand is actually inert until explosive detection professionals have the chance to examine the item			1
grenades , whether inactive or otherwise , are prohibited in any carry - on or checked luggage			2
another item to leave out of your hand luggage ? seal bombs , like those discovered in a passenger 's carry - on bag in @entity49 's @entity48			2
a seal bomb is a small explosive used to frighten seals from fishing areas , but , unfortunately , what this traveller did n't know is that all explosives are prohibited from both carry - on and checked baggage			2
seal bombs , used for fishing , are prohibited from both carry - on and checked luggage one of the oddest items that @entity63 came across while browsing the @entity12 was definitely a medieval mace , which was discovered in a carry - on bag at @entity67 's @entity66			1
similarly dangerous , a pair of cat - shaped brass knuckles were seized at the @entity71			0
while they may look like a key chain at first glance , these feline - inspired weapons can cause serious harm and are banned from bringing on board			0
one of the strangest confiscated items ? a medieval mace , found at @entity67 's @entity66 these cat - shaped brass knuckles must be checked into the hold in order to be transported in 2012 , officers seized a bag of live eels , which they found in a passenger 's checked luggage in @entity87 officers received a massive shock when they discovered a bag full of live eels back in 2012			1
found in a passenger 's checked bag at the @entity94 , the traveller was attempting to transport 163 marine tropical fish and 22 invertebrates to @entity97 , @entity98			0
however , instead of arguing with security , the passenger , smartly , opted to surrender all items to the @entity102			0
seven small snakes were also discovered in @entity87 in 2011 , after being stuffed down a traveller 's trousers in nylon stockings			0
the snakes were found using @entity9 's @entity108 , which allows officers to find threatening items that have been concealed from plain sight			1
the passenger was later arrested and charged			0
and yet another animal - based smuggling attempt was made in the form of a knife concealed within a @entity117 greeting card , despite the fact that all knives are prohibited from carry - on bags			0
a @entity117 greeting card was used by a crafty passenger to unsuccessfully conceal a knife also in @entity87 in 2011 , a passenger attempted to smuggle seven snakes , in nylon stockings , in their trousers swords , though fine to check , can not be brought on board an airplane as a carry - on item this @entity133 - like sickle was seized from a passenger 's bag because no blades are allowed on board throwing stars , which are used in martial arts , are banned in some @entity142 states but not others interestingly , one item travellers can bring through security : a freshly - baked pie , like this one from swords and a @entity133 - like sickle to throwing stars , all bladed objects are prohibited from carry - on bags - but that has n't kept many passengers from attempting to transport them through the security checkpoint			1
but do n't worry , even swords can be taken to your destination in a checked suitcase			0
interestingly , however , you are allowed to bring baked goods through security , such as this pecan pie .			0
