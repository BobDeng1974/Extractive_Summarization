by @entity0 published : 19:04 est , 28 august 2012 updated : 19:19 est , 28 august 2012 furious : local government minister @entity2 said the decision by some councils to give its councillors inflation - busting pay rises was ' completely unjustifiable ' hundreds of councillors awarded themselves inflation - busting rises in allowances last year			1
figures show that a dozen town halls did so despite the pay freeze for many local government workers			1
one council increased allowances by 28 per cent – the first stage of an 85 per cent rise over three years			1
the hikes , which came even as local authorities made vocal protests about the impact of the government ’s budget cuts , have been condemned by local government minister @entity2 as ‘ completely unjustifiable ’			1
there have been repeated complaints that allowances – which are paid automatically to all elected councillors and are not linked to the amount of work they do or meetings they attend – have been overly generous			2
they cost taxpayers more than £ 200million a year , with several town halls doubling their allowances over the past seven years			2
the latest national breakdown of increases has been published by the @entity38 ’ @entity39 , which found 32 councils raised allowances between the financial year 2010/11 , the @entity43 ’s first year in power , and 2011/12			0
twelve raised them by more than 4 per cent – the level of inflation at the start of the last financial year as taken from the consumer price index			0
they included @entity53 borough council in @entity54 , which gave its 32 elected members a 28 per cent increase to push the basic allowance paid to a councillor with no special responsibilities from £ 2,378 a year to £ 3,052			1
a further increase to £ 3,727 followed this spring , and next year there will be another rise to £ 4,400			1
this will amount to an 85 per cent hike since 2010 , pushing basic pay from £ 46 to £ 85 a week			0
@entity66 , leader of the council , argued that allowances for the authority ‘ lagged far behind all others in @entity54 ’			0
inflation - buster : @entity53 borough council ( above ) in @entity54 gave its 32 elected members a 28 per cent increase in @entity75 , allowances went up by 19 per cent in the autumn of 2010 from £ 5,973 to £ 7,100			1
‘ it was the first time in seven years that the allowance was increased , ’ a council spokesman said			0
‘ our allowances were considerably lower than those in neighbouring boroughs			0
’ in fact , @entity75 is bordered on three sides by @entity88 district council , which pays its councillors a basic £ 4,100 a year			1
of the 12 which raised allowances above inflation , five councils also increased council tax			0
the @entity95 pointed to major differences between the allowances in neighbouring authorities , and questioned why @entity99 pays £ 16,000 while next door @entity100 pays less than £ 6,500			2
of large metropolitan authorities , @entity102 pays £ 16,267 – almost £ 10,000 more than @entity100			2
@entity95 chief executive @entity104 said : ‘ with local authorities up and down the country having to rein in spending , councillors who have awarded themselves an increase in their allowances in defiance of government advice should hang their heads in shame			1
' they can not retain the moral authority to make tough decisions on spending			0
’ mr @entity2 said : ‘ most councils have frozen or cut councillor allowances to do their bit			0
‘ however , a small minority have hiked them which is completely unjustifiable given rank - and - file workers in local government have faced a pay freeze			2
these councils should be held to account			0

hikes come as local authorities complain about the impact of @entity134 cuts
@entity53 borough gave its members a 28 ***%*** increase
@entity140 *23* ***%*** and @entity75 19 ***%*** , new figures show
