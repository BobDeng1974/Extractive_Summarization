the group of friends dressed as chocolate bars and lay on the ground as a @entity5 selection pack over the years @entity5 fancy dress outfits have evolved from novelty jumpers to reindeer onesies			1
but this group of friends from @entity10 , @entity11 , took the task of coming up with a festive outfit to the next level when they donned chocolate bar costumes and became a @entity18 selection box			1
the outfits were the group 's effort for the ' 12 pubs of @entity5 ' - an annual seasonal pub crawl , which sees revellers dress in festive attire and down a drink in a dozen different bars in the city			1
pictures of the 12 men , two of which had travelled from @entity33 for the big event , went viral on social media overnight and have had over 350,000 likes on @entity37			1
@entity38 , 31 , who runs a fitness company , came up with the novel idea over a month ago and set to work putting the plan together			0
he told the @entity42 : ' we 've been doing the 12 pubs bar crawl every year for the last seven years			1
' it 's a group of 12 of us and every year we have a different theme			2
last year we went as the nativity and we did n't think we could top that this year and then we came up with this			0
' my friend @entity49 made all the costumes by hand			0
we all chipped in with a few quid for him to get the material , but it must 've taken him a long time to make			0
' when the group got together yesterday they posed for pictures , which family and friends posted on the internet before they had even left the house			1
mr @entity38 , who was dressed as the @entity67 bar , added : ' when we got into the city centre people were saying to us you 're all over @entity37 and loads of people wanted pictures			2
' we were really surprised with the reaction			0
last year we thought we had a great idea and we were saying it 's never going to be topped but we put a lot of effort into it			0
' they dressed up in the festive - themed outfits to take part in the ' 12 pubs of @entity5 ' in @entity10 yesterday they were dressed as everything from a dairy milk to a @entity86 and made it round all of the 12 designated pubs			1
the group have known each other for several years and mr @entity38 says the event is the time of year they all get together			2
' some of my friends have moved away so most of them come home for @entity5 - in fact two of them flew over from @entity33 and one came over from @entity100			1
' we 're just a group of friends getting together			2
we go and get a drink in each of the 12 pubs and spend about 30 minutes in them - but it 's a really well planned event			1
' and instead of waking up with too much of a hangover , mr @entity38 said he was woken up to hundreds of messages on his phone from people who had seen he had gone viral			0
pictures of the group - two of which flew in from @entity33 and one from @entity100 to take part - have gone viral even @entity114 were impressed and tweeted : ' this has made our day ! ! ! so well made and perfectly modeled : ) # @entity115 '			1
the 12 pubs of @entity5 has become increasingly popular in the @entity11 capital and brings with it challenges along the way , including ' left - handed pub ' where you can only drink with one hand			1
other tasks might be the ' silent pub ' - no talking - and the ' swapsies pub ' where the punters have to swap shoes with each other			0
but there are concerns from health authorities over the harmful effects of heavy drinking			0
@entity133 , an accredited counsellor with the @entity134 of @entity11 , told the @entity135 , that people are dicing with death by taking part in the ‘ tradition ’			1
from left to right , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity38 , @entity145 , @entity142 , @entity49 , @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148 # there are two drinking festivals in @entity11 now – @entity151 and @entity5			2
' go to @entity152 over the next few weeks and you ’ll see an awful lot of @entity5 jumpers – head injuries , intoxication , domestic violence , fights			2
the common factor is alcohol			0
“ six hundred people self - harmed [ died by suicide ] last year and no parent relishes the thought of that			0
loading young people with cheap alcohol is a recipe for disaster			0
