compensation : @entity7 had to leave the @entity2 after an operation for his loud snoring had catastrophic medical consequences has been awarded £ 1.5million damages at the @entity6 for long periods , said the judge , the father of two , who had served in @entity23 , was effectively a ‘ prisoner ’ in his home			1

mr @entity7 , from @entity28 , brought an action against @entity30 and @entity31 , which agreed to compensate him on the basis of 63 per cent liability , without any admissions being made			1
the judge said mr @entity7 , who is partially wheelchair dependent , was very keen to get better , so far as possible			2
his sense of injustice stemmed from the fact that he was advised to have a ‘ pointless ’ operation – which led to his suffering constant pain , the loss of an enjoyable and rewarding career and the fundamental upheaval of his happy family life			2

‘ the contrast with his previous personality , physical capacity and positive lifestyle could hardly be greater , ’ the judge said			0
he added that , thanks mainly to the strength of character of mr @entity7 ’s wife , ‘ the family structure remains largely intact ’			0
the judge said that if mr @entity7 had not become disabled , it was likely he would have retired at 50 with the rank of captain and then obtained a responsible post in the private sector where he would have stayed until he was 68			0
