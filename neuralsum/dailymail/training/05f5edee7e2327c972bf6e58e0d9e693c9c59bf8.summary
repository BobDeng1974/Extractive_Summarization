the average interest rate on an easy - access @entity2 account has fallen to a record low			1
the typical rate on an account which allows people to get immediate access to their money has plunged to 1.17 per cent after falling for five months in a row , according to respected financial website @entity10			1
this is the lowest average rate since it began keeping records in 2007 , the year before the financial crash			1
experts said it was another sign that savers had been ‘ sacrificed ’ in favour of mortgage borrowers			1
it also suggests that @entity27 ’s flagship policy of raising to £ 15,000 the amount savers can deposit in a tax - free @entity2 – announced in what he dubbed a ‘ budget for savers ’ in march – is unlikely to be of much use to those with nest eggs			1
far from reinvigorating the savings market , the @entity33 scheme to increase the allowance in @entity36 had proved to be a flop , it was claimed yesterday			0
in 2012 there were 403 @entity2 products on the market but now there are 283 , suggesting banks are not competing to give savers a good rate			2
@entity44 , editor at @entity10 , said : ‘ rates are still at historically low levels , product numbers continue to fall and the @entity2 market as a whole remains subdued			1
the typical rate on an account which allows people to get immediate access to their money has plunged to 1.17 per cent ‘ despite the hype surrounding the new allowance , it ’s as though providers have decided to just sit this one out			2
’ critics blamed the @entity59 ( @entity60 ) for rendering savers of little value to banks , leading them not to bother competing for their business			0
the scheme allowed banks and building societies to borrow money cheaply from the @entity69 for lending to people seeking mortgages			0
launched in 2012 , it was designed to breathe new life into the housing market after the economic crisis – but savings rates dropped because banks no longer needed to lure savers to raise funds			0
although the @entity60 scheme is now closed to mortgage lenders , they still have billions of pounds to call on – and little incentive to attract savers , critics said			0
mrs @entity44 said : ‘ @entity60 has had a greater negative impact on savings rates than the historic low @entity69 rate			0
’ the @entity69 base rate has been at 0.5 per cent since 2009 , but is expected to rise by the beginning of spring			0
however , experts said the rise – which will push up interest rates on savings accounts – would be barely felt if savers ’ rates continued to fall now .			2
