pressure is growing on @entity1 , chancellor of the exchequer , to deliver a tax break for married couples at least three cabinet ministers are backing demands for @entity6 to deliver a tax break for married couples within months			2
allies of @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 indicated yesterday that they want the long - promised measure – worth £ 150 a year – to be introduced in the @entity13 in spring 2013			2
they spoke out as 15 mps , including several ex-ministers , yesterday called in an open letter to mr @entity6 for the change to be introduced to @entity19 as part of next year 's finance bill			1
the intervention piles pressure on chancellor @entity1 to placate social conservatives who are already enraged that he and mr @entity6 have made public statements in support of gay marriage , rather than recognising traditional marriage in the tax system			2
mr @entity6 has promised to introduce a transferable tax allowance for married couples in this @entity19 and @entity32 officials said yesterday that is still the government 's intention			1
but @entity35 right - wingers are concerned that the measure , which is opposed by the @entity37 , will be left until the final budget before the 2015 election			1
@entity40 mr @entity9 has privately indicated that this is unacceptable to him because it would mean taxpayers would not see the benefit before the election – due around may – allowing an incoming @entity47 government to easily reverse it			0
he also believes the measure would be dismissed as ' tokenism ' if it was left until the dying days of the @entity49 to be implemented			0
a friend of mr @entity10 , the environment secretary , said : ' he agrees with @entity9 on this			0
' and a source close to mr @entity11 , the justice secretary , said : ' @entity11 believes it 's an important commitment for us to deliver			0
' the mps backing the letter include former children 's minister @entity58 , former defence minister sir @entity59 and @entity60 , secretary of the @entity61 of back - bench mps			1
the letter comes at a time of deep divisions in the @entity35 over social policy			2
mr @entity1 provoked a backlash earlier this week when he claimed the @entity35 have to back gay marriage if they want to win the election			0
he urged the party to emulate @entity72 's socially liberal policies to win over young voters and women , who were credited with ensuring he retained the @entity76			0
allies of @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 indicated yesterday that they want the long - promised measure worth £ 150 a year conservative secretary of state for justice @entity11 ( centre ) , the former minister of state for work and pensions , has , according to allies , indicated he wants the long - promised marriage tax break and yesterday the boss of one of @entity86 's biggest polling companies accused @entity87 of misrepresenting its results of a survey on gay marriage			1
mr @entity6 said in a letter to former @entity94 secretary @entity93 , who opposes gay marriage , that a @entity96 poll found 10 per cent of current conservative voters said the policy would make them less likely to vote conservative compared with 7 per cent saying it would make them more likely			1
but @entity96 boss @entity103 said yesterday mr @entity6 had got his figures wrong			0
he added that the policy ' loses the party more votes than it gains ' , with ' former conservative voters less likely to return to the fold '			1
other @entity96 polls showed it had a ' general detrimental impact on the party 's fortunes ' , he added			0
proposals for gay marriage and the marriage tax break are expected to be introduced some time after the next @entity118 and before the general election			0
a senior @entity121 source said : ' we are committed to recognise marriage in the tax system			1

a group of 15 senior conservative mps call on the @entity128 to live up to his *pre-election* pledge
a stay - at - home spouse would be able to transfer their tax - free allowance to their partner
the @entity137 committed to bringing the policy forward - with @entity37 allowed to *abstain*
