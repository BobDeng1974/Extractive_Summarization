the @entity0 who shot himself dead on tuesday was able to hide his massive marijuana business thanks to his cherries			1
@entity3 , 57 , was able to keep investigators in the dark as the smell of the 400,000 pounds of @entity7 cherries his plant processed each week managed to mask the stench of the up to 1,200 marijuana plants he was capable of growing			1
furthermore , the other red flag for authorities would have been the heightened electric bill from running grow lamps - something that was also masked by his large operation			2
the @entity44 reports that investigators then discovered a crawl space that led to a 50 - foot - by - 50 - foot area that was divided into several rooms			1
authorities now believe the rooms were for growing the plans			0
one room contained seeds of 60 different marijuana strains and about $ 125,000 in cash			2
@entity58 ( left ) , nephew of @entity3 , and @entity60 ( right ) , his daughter , continued the family legacy by working at @entity36 's @entity7 they believe a crop had just been harvested , as only three bags with about 100 pounds of marijuana were discovered during their search			1
all that , along with 120 expensive grow lamps , were completely hidden , leading one source to speculate he could have been working alone and not with the help of others at the company			0
' in theory , it could have been him and outsiders , ' said the source			0
' this is a secreted part of a large factory that was designed so a large number of employees wo nâ€™t know			0
' despite all this , the company , which has contracts with numerous national restaurant chains such as @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 , is back in business and family lawyer @entity92 states managers are cooperating fully with the @entity95 's investigation			1

@entity3 , the president of @entity36 's @entity7 in @entity101 , shot himself dead tuesday during an investigation of his business
authorities had been there investigating claims the company was dumping hazardous *material* , but later found a massive marijuana operation
investigators now say @entity3 hid the smell of the 1,200 plants he grew with the *sweet* smell of the 400,000 pounds of cherries produced daily
the electricity needed for the lamps that helped the plants grow was also masked by the already high energy consumed by the factory
authorities found three bags of marijuana *weighing* 100 pounds each and $ 125,000 in cash after discovering secret rooms hidden by a crawl space
the factory , which serves numerous national chains such as @entity88 and @entity89 , is back in business
