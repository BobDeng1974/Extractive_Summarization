much will be written about the trip to @entity1 in the middle of a season and the logic of landing back in the country 21 hours before a match			1
but was @entity8 's mid-season jaunt behind their staggering loss to @entity10 ? it would certainly appear so			1
@entity12 watches on as his @entity8 side were beaten 2 - 0 by @entity10 on saturday but the @entity8 boss refused to blame their week - long trip to @entity1 for the @entity18 defeat city players @entity23 ( left ) , @entity19 ( centre ) and @entity21 look dejected after their side concede in the first half there was little evidence of what was to follow			1
the hosts were probed and pressed throughout and if it was not for the heroics of @entity10 keeper @entity32 they would have been out of sight			0
however , after the break it was a different story			0
the buoyant visitors seemed to hit a visibly tiring home side at will on the break			0
had it not been for some fine stops from @entity41 and a post denying the effervescent @entity43 a goal of the season contender , they would have made the scoreline look even worse than 2 - 0			1
at one stage a frustrated @entity47 seemed to just stop what he was doing			0
it looked as though their minds were still in @entity1			2
@entity53 raced through to put @entity10 ahead early in the second half the on - loan @entity56 striker celebrates after scoring @entity10 's opening goal against @entity8 @entity10 substitute @entity58 celebrates after scoring in stoppage time to seal his side 's @entity18 passage when the board came up to tell us four minutes were to be added on we expected one final onslaught , but it simply did not come			1
if anything , it was the visitors who finished the stronger of the two and the game was up long before @entity58 sealed the deal			2
@entity8 may point to a lack of match fitness to key players such as @entity74 and @entity75			2
@entity19 looked nervy as did @entity76			0
the @entity8 squad are put through their paces during their warm - weather training camp trip to @entity1 manager @entity12 and his players arrived back in @entity81 at about 8pm on friday night @entity82 and @entity74 headed straight to the club 's training base to prepare for saturday 's game but this was a team that should not be beaten by @entity10 , as superb as @entity89 's men were			1
can a seven - hour flight in business class and a four - hour time difference have such an impact ? @entity8 will deny it but this , as we are told time and time again , is a game of fine margins			2
defeat , and the trip to @entity1 will linger			0
the champions ' @entity18 hopes have faded before their tans .			0

@entity8 lost 2 - 0 to @entity10 in their @entity18 third round *tie*
goals from @entity53 and @entity58 sealed a *deserved* win for @entity10
the champions went on a mid-season warm - weather training camp to @entity1 during the *international* break
however , they arrived back in the @entity113 just 21 hours before the *cup* clash
city players were *n't* at the races and their minds looked elsewhere as they were easily beaten by the @entity120 outfit
