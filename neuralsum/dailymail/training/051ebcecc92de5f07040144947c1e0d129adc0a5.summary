by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 is planning to announce his arrival as @entity5 manager by pulling off the spectacular signing of @entity8 forward @entity7			1
@entity7 ’s @entity8 team - mate @entity9 and @entity11 pair @entity10 and @entity12 have all been linked with @entity13 , who will be confirmed as @entity15 ’ successor next week			1
but informed sources in @entity17 have revealed that @entity7 is the name at the top of @entity21 ’s wanted list and that he is the one manager the @entity17 striker would leave his home club for			0
wanted man : @entity2 wants to sign @entity8 forward @entity7 for @entity5 this summer forward planning : @entity26 @entity13 is set to be appointed as @entity5 boss next week new look : our mocked - up version of how @entity7 would look in a @entity5 home shirt frustrated figure : @entity7 , pictured here tussling @entity34 's @entity33 , is not happy with his role at @entity8 @entity7 is unhappy with his role on the fringes of @entity8 ’s starting line - up under @entity39 and has become increasingly frustrated at being left on the bench for key games , such as the @entity43 showdown with their main rivals @entity11 and @entity45 ’ @entity47 tie against @entity5			1
@entity48 - born , he saw himself spending his entire career at the @entity50 but has been forced to contemplate the unthinkable of seeking a fresh start			0
according to sources close to him , @entity13 ’s imminent appointment as @entity5 boss has turned his sights towards @entity56			0
while there have been widespread reports of some players being at odds with the @entity62 coach , due to his confrontational style , @entity7 readily concedes he owes his standing as one of @entity17 ’s foremost forwards to the 62 - year old			2
as manager of @entity8 , @entity13 promoted @entity7 from the junior ranks and helped establish him as one of the @entity43 ’s most accomplished finishers			2
undecided : @entity73 ' role next season is not known history : @entity7 , pictured here in action against @entity5 , was brought through @entity8 's youth ranks by @entity13 new man : @entity2 ( right ) has been appointed @entity5 boss and could bring @entity81 @entity13 has not forgotten how he responded to being given his opportunity and has been alerted to the stand - off that has developed between him and @entity39			1
though @entity5 are not exactly short of strikers , with @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 all vying for places , @entity13 is renowned for being single - minded about the players he wants and will not hesitate to move for @entity7			2
persuading @entity8 to do business may be a different matter			0
under contract until 2017 , @entity7 is hugely popular with team - mates and supporters , who see him as the face of the club due to his @entity48 roots and the way he graduated through the youth ranks			0
@entity101 : @entity11 forward @entity12 is being eyed by @entity13 as part of his new look @entity5 on the move ? @entity8 midfielder @entity9 has been on @entity5 's wishlist for some time but that wo n’t stop @entity13 dipping into his massive transfer budget and trying to lure him to @entity56 to form a new - look strike partnership alongside @entity85			1
should he succeed , it would leave a further question mark against the future of @entity86 , who would be left hoping @entity13 might consider using him just behind the main strikers .			0
