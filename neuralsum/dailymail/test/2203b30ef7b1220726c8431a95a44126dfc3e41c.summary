i conducted a poll on my radio show recently , and more than 70 per cent of those who voted believe @entity4 will win the title next season			1
is it heart ruling the head among the @entity4 faithful ? or is there a genuine belief that serial winner @entity12 is about to re-assert himself at the very top again ? @entity4 boss @entity12 was left frustrated after his side were defeated 1 - 0 by @entity15 @entity16 poses for pictures with @entity4 fans at the training ground during a day for the club 's foundation @entity16 ( pictured talking to fans ) is starting to assert himself at the @entity4 after a stuttering start if he is to take @entity4 back to the very top , he ’ll need more than @entity23			1
i ’ve already established in this column recently that @entity16 is a great , and he is a winner			1
i love the fact he has set himself this huge challenge of resurrecting a fallen giant at the end of his career			0
the @entity32 knows , however , he will not be judged on his ability to repair the damage done by @entity35			2
at the end of his ( albeit shorter ) @entity38 stay , his record will need to stand comparison with that of sir @entity42			1
obviously @entity16 can not win the same number of trophies sir @entity42 picked up during his 27 year reign , so relatively speaking what does he need to achieve to be considered a success at @entity4 ? sir @entity42 underachieved in @entity49 : only two @entity50 wins in his time – just one more than @entity52 in the same period , and the same number as @entity54 ( who won those in significantly fewer years )			1
@entity16 has also underachieved in this department – his only @entity50 win was with @entity58 , not @entity59 or @entity60			2
@entity16 will be hungry to add to that success which came 20 years ago			1
he should target @entity63 success as soon as possible			0
domestically , @entity4 still do n’t quite look like the finished article , despite their impressive run in 2015			2
but they should at least be challenging for the title next season			0
so what needs to change for @entity4 to reach that level where they are in the mix to win the @entity71 and the @entity50 ? sir @entity42 celebrates his second @entity50 triumph with @entity4 in 2008 @entity16 celebrates winning the @entity50 with @entity58 in 1995 - his only triumph in @entity49 keeping @entity74 would be ideal , but @entity75 has winning experience and there is a bond between the former @entity60 keeper and the manager after their time together at the @entity82			1
@entity16 blooded @entity75 and then man - managed him superbly			2
either keeper is fine , it ’s obvious who would be preferred though			0
@entity4 need a quality right back – @entity87 has been linked and the @entity89 man would be perfect			1
if @entity87 is the right fit , @entity90 needs to stay fit			2
he ’s been like a rabbit in the headlights this first season , but he ’s dealt with @entity16 ’s brutally honest management style well and put in a fine performance at @entity15			2
i ’ve said before , @entity90 has the potential to be an all - time great at @entity4			1
at centre half , @entity99 and @entity100 might become the trusted partnership , or wisdom may win the day and @entity4 could go and get @entity104 from @entity105			1
he ’s a winner and a leader – perfect for @entity4			1
@entity90 ( right ) has had a difficult start to his @entity4 career but impressed against @entity15 @entity104 ( left ) of @entity105 is a player who has long been linked with a move to @entity4 in midfield , @entity4 are strong in my view – @entity114 and @entity115 can fight for that anchor spot , or even play together depending on the opposition			1
i ca n’t help thinking that adding another @entity115 - type player to the squad might be a wise move for @entity16			2
united fans are seeing the best of @entity123 and @entity124 in this current period , while @entity126 and @entity127 have been big positives this season			0
@entity131 ’s quality and contribution as @entity4 captain is never up for debate – for me he should be the closest challenger to @entity135 for @entity136			2
which leaves players like @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142			0
@entity143 ( holding off @entity15 's @entity144 ) has impressed for @entity4 in recent weeks @entity126 ( right ) is starting to show his best form after moving from @entity15 last january @entity142 ( centre ) has struggled this season but to leave him leave would be a massive risk for @entity4 @entity4 's on - loan striker @entity140 has struggled for form ever since joining the club last summer @entity139 has stalled a little bit after bursting onto the scene , but he may yet come good			1
@entity153 would be brilliant off the bench next season – he ’s still capable of scoring important goals			0
the two @entity157 are expensive stellar players , but neither have impressed in their first season in @entity161 football			0
to let both leave would be a gamble – @entity165 rivals will pick them up , and if they suddenly re-discover their game , @entity4 will look foolish			2
keeping both is also a risk , but one worth taking if you add one more world - class attacking player			0
and that ’s why @entity4 need to go all out to get @entity173			1
at times this season @entity4 have been so slow in their build up			0
@entity173 brings dynamism , goals and energy to a side			0
he could flourish at @entity4 , stepping out of @entity180 ’s shadow at @entity181			0
@entity4 have already enquired about @entity183 ’s @entity182 , he has all the skills and end product to be loved at @entity38 , but @entity4 still need that marquee man to humiliate opposing defences at home and abroad			1
@entity23 ( left , in action for @entity183 ) is a prime target for @entity4 and has the potential to be a great signing @entity173 has the dynamism , goals and energy that @entity4 have missed in their side this season @entity16 signed a three - year deal			1
if he wins the @entity71 and the @entity50 in that time he will be considered a total success at @entity4			0
it ’s a tough ask , but he could win both next season			0
given his record of winning titles elsewhere , i certainly would n’t rule that out			0
i suspect the @entity4 haters will have to calm themselves down over the next few seasons			0
did they really think @entity4 would be gone for long ?			0

@entity4 have shown great promise for the future in recent matches
@entity12 has a decent squad at @entity38 but must add to it
@entity173 , @entity23 , @entity104 and @entity87 on list
@entity16 is a serial winner and can get @entity4 challenging for *honours*
@entity32 will want to leave @entity4 with record that compares to sir @entity42
