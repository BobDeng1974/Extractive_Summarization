" but it was early in the second half , so you have a lot of time to recover and get back into the game if you keep playing football			2
but we were just too sloppy			2
we were n't sharp enough			2
" the thing is , we have a big squad now			2
everyone knows that and you have to perform every week			2
" if you do n't it is simple - you are out			0
we have enough players to take your place in every position			1
it is good for the team			0
" @entity65 villain : @entity39 scores the winner for @entity18 to give them an opening day win asked if he thought the new players needed more time to gel with their team - mates , @entity2 added : " i do n't think they have time			1
" it is the @entity16 and you have to be there from the start			1
if you are not , then you have to look in the mirror and say you have to do better			0
" @entity3 announced their latest new signing just prior to the @entity18 match , with @entity81 winger @entity29 - who was ineligible for the game - joining on a season - long loan deal from @entity84			1
@entity10 has subsequently indicated there will be no further additions to the squad in this transfer window and that " one or two " players could be departing			1
" it 's fair to say , i think our business is done now , " @entity10 said on @entity90			1
" one or two players may be leaving the club but i do n't envisage anyone else coming in			1
we 're done now - it 's a case of working with the group that we 've got			0
" flurry of signings : @entity29 signed for @entity3 on a season - long loan from @entity84 regarding 23 - year - old @entity103 , @entity10 said : " we 're very happy that @entity29 has come to the club			1
" he 's a player with a great deal of potential but he has n't played as much football as he would have wanted to in recent years			0
" he 's desperate to play and that 's why he has come to us			0
he 's a good young player and will bring pace and power			0
" there has also been plenty of change at @entity18 , with @entity115 midfielder @entity114 arriving on friday as their most recent summer acquisition			1

and the 29 - year - old @entity133 international was delighted with how his " second debut " went			0
reflecting on the victory , @entity124 said : " first and foremost you have to defend well , and to get a clean sheet was brilliant			0
all the boys are happy enough			0
" it is unbelievable to come away from the @entity140 with a win , being as hard a place as it is to get three points			0
" and with it also being a second debut for myself , it was brilliant			0
" obviously it is difficult ( being out of the first team for so long ) , but you just work hard and try your best , and when you get given a chance you have to take it			0
