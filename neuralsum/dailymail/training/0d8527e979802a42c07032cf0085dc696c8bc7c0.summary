by @entity0 one of the biggest and hottest explosions in the universe - a rare event known as a gamma - ray burst - has been spotted on camera			1
and this particular event , caused by the enormous explosions of a star , occurred shortly after the @entity10 about 12.1 billion years ago			1
the intense light recently reached @entity12 and it could give astronomers useful information about the conditions in the young universe			2
light from an explosion of a massive star at the end of its life 12.1 billion years ago reached @entity12 recently			1
an image of its peak afterglow , circled with blue and yellow , was captured by @entity29 's @entity28 telescope at @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32			2
a bright star sits on the left of the afterglow gamma - ray bursts are believed to be the catastrophic collapse of a star at the end of its life			1
the observation was made by the telescope @entity41 at the @entity30 in the @entity43 , owned by the @entity29 ( @entity29 ) in @entity44			0
a gamma ray burst occurs when a massive star dies and collapses , causing a huge explosion known as a supernova			1
the remnant of this supernova is often a neutron star , quark star or black hole			0
during the supernova a narrow beam of intense radiation known as a gamma - ray burst ( @entity5 ) is sometimes released from either pole of the star			1
this burst can last anywhere from a few milliseconds to several minutes , with an ‘ afterglow ’ normally persisting after			0
a grb is incredibly powerful , typically releasing more energy in seconds than the sun will in its 10 billion - year lifetime			1
a planet caught in one of these bursts would lose its atmosphere instantly and would be left a burnt cinder , astronomers say			0
scientists might be able to detect warning signs of an impending gamma ray burst but if a burst were headed for @entity12 there would n't be anything anybody could do about it			2
however , astronomers put the chances of that happening at around 1 in 10 million			2
@entity29 physicists report that their telescope was the first on the ground to observe the burst , and to capture an image			0
this particular explosion , first spotted back in april , was recorded as @entity90 by @entity92 's @entity91 ( @entity93 )			0
gamma - ray bursts are not well understood by astronomers , but they are considered important , according to @entity96 , a graduate student in @entity29 's @entity97 , who monitored the observations along with two astronomers in @entity100 and @entity101			1
' as @entity92 points out , gamma - ray bursts are the most powerful explosions in the universe since the @entity10 , ' he said			1
' these bursts release more energy in 10 seconds than our @entity12 's sun during its entire expected lifespan of 10 billion years			1
' some of these grbs appear to be related to supernovae and correspond to the end - of - life of a massive star , said dr @entity115 , physics professor and leader of the @entity29 astronomy team			2
' gamma - ray bursts may be particularly massive cousins to supernovae , or may correspond to cases in which the explosion ejecta are more beamed in our direction			1
by studying them , we learn about supernovae , ' @entity115 said			0
@entity29 's @entity129 telescope ( pictured ) at the @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 had the earliest and brightest observation from the ground of a gamma - ray burst that occurred more than 12 billion years ago			1
the telescope is part of the @entity135 scientists were n't able to detect optical light from gamma - ray bursts until the late 1990s , when telescope technology improved			1
among all lights in the electromagnetic spectrum , gamma rays have the shortest wavelengths and are visible only using special detectors			0
gamma - ray bursts result from hot stars that measure as enormous as 50 solar masses			1
the explosion occurs when the stars run out of fuel and collapse in on themselves , often forming black holes			0
@entity153 layers detonate , shooting out material along the rotation axis in powerful , high - energy jets that include gamma radiation			2
as the gamma radiation declines , the explosion produces an afterglow of visible optical light			2
the light , in turn , fades very quickly , said @entity115			0
physicists calculate the distance of the explosion based on the shifting wavelength of the light , or redshift			0
' the optical light is visible for anywhere from a few seconds to a few hours , ' @entity115 said			2
' sometimes optical telescopes can capture the spectra			0
this allows us to calculate the redshift of the light , which tells us how fast the light is moving away from us			0
this is an indirect indication of the distance from us			0
' to put into context the age of the new gamma - ray burst discoveries , @entity115 and @entity96 point out that the @entity10 occurred 13.81 billion years ago			1
@entity184 , meanwhile , exploded about 12.1 billion years ago , which is ' only about one and a half billion years after the universe began , ' said @entity96			2
' that is really old			0
' a planet caught in the path of a gamma - ray bursts burst would lose its atmosphere instantly and would be left a burnt cinder , astronomers say ( artist 's illustration shown )			1
the chances of @entity12 being hit by one , which would apparently be almost undetectable , stands at around 1 in 10 million armed with images of the burst , astronomers can analyse the observational data to draw further conclusions about the structure of the early universe			1
' at the time of this gamma - ray burst 's explosion , the universe looked vastly different than it does now , ' @entity115 said			1
' it was an early stage of galaxy formation			0
there were n't heavy elements to make @entity12 - like planets			0
' so this is a glimpse at the early universe			2
observing gamma - ray bursts is important for gaining information about the early universe			1
' the @entity5 's brightness , regarded as being ' of the 12th magnitude ' , was also impressive ; it was just 10 times dimmer than what can be seen through binoculars in the night sky and only 200 times dimmer than what the human eye can see			0
' the difference in brightness is about the same as between the brightest star you can see in the sky , and the dimmest you can see with the naked eye on a clear , dark night , ' @entity115 said			0
' considering this thing was at the edge of the visible universe , that 's an extreme explosion			0

astronomers using a telescope in @entity32 have spotted the gamma - ray burst
the rare explosion 12.1 billion light years away was caused by a supernova
gamma - ray bursts release more energy in seconds than the sun in its entire 10 billion - year lifetime
only a *handful* are thought to happen in a galaxy every few million years
this particular event occurred not long after the @entity10 in *cosmic* terms
it could give scientists ' information about the early universe ' says dr @entity115
