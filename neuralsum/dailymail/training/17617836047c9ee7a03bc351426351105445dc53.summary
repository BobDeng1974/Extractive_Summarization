@entity2 ’s political debate show q&a has come under fire for cutting to a close - up shot of a ginger audience member during a debate on terrorism			1
the popular show features a range of panel contributors , who discuss all the hot issues of the week			0
during a heated conversation on the topic of terrorism and particularly on @entity18 - born ginger jihadist @entity17 , the camera shifts suddenly from the panel and focuses in on a man in the audience			1
while the panel were busy discussing the serious subject on how to prevent @entity18 from joining the @entity24 , the program cut to the auburn - haired man , who vaguely resembled the ginger jihadist			1
the man appeared to be unaware that the camera has focused on him and continued to listen intently to the discussion			2
the panel also continued on with their ramblings , blissfully unaware of the hiccup , as they debated whether the @entity41 experience has taught us anything			0
however , @entity45 users were quick to point out the programs fault , taking to their accounts to vent their anger			0
while the panel were busy discussing the serious subject on how to prevent @entity18 from joining the @entity24 , the program cut to the auburn - haired man , who vaguely resembled the ginger jihadist ' they always cut to inappropriate on this show ' wrote @entity56			1
' not sure if ' ginger jihadi ' or @entity59 hipster			0
# qanda ' said @entity60 the major fail came just a week after a propaganda video released by @entity24 appeared online , featuring @entity18 @entity17			1
the man appeared to be unaware that the camera has focused on him and continued to listen intently to the discussion the 17 - year - old , who grew up in @entity66 in @entity68 's west , also appeared in another video today			1
the teen is seen in the latest video on the banks of the @entity73 , surrounded by dozens of men dressed in black wielding weapons			0
the video is titled an evening on the banks of the @entity79 , and shows groups of militants chanting and praying			2
just last week @entity17 appeared in a chilling video where he condemned @entity83 and @entity84 at some points the teenager , who grew up in @entity66 in @entity68 's west , appears to stifle a smile or laughter @entity17 is wearing the same black and white keffiyeh he was seen in the previous video , and is flanking a man speaking to the group			2
earlier this week reports @entity17 could face 25 years behind bars should he ever return to @entity18 soil emerged			2
@entity97 counterterrorism head @entity95 told the @entity98 that @entity17 , who now goes by the moniker @entity100 , has ' basically admitted he is a member of a proscribed terrorist organisation '			0
' the fact that he is admitting that he is a member of @entity103 , which he does in the video , straight away says that he has committed an offence under the criminal code			0
that ’s up to 25 years imprisonment , ' he said			0
@entity18 - born @entity17 ( left ) has appeared in a second @entity103 propoganda video			1

the @entity18 - born teenager also appeared in another video today , where he is surrounded by chanting militants
