babies as young as five - months - old are attending weekly classes where they learn maths , @entity4 and foreign languages in a bid to stimulate their brains			1
@entity9 , a @entity11 program with schools in @entity13 and @entity14 , has an average student age of 18 - months			1
the education program aims to stimulate the right side , or the creative side , of their pupil 's brains by presenting them with numerous flashcards - printed with numbers , world flags and even classical art - for less than one second at a time			1
' they might not be able to say " that 's [ the number ] ten " right away , but eventually it will connect in their minds			2
' we are n't trying to create little geniuses ; we want them to love learning '			0
while some people may be dubious about the effectiveness of the program , ms @entity31 claimed that many parents had attested to seeing results , even thanks to the placards of famous artworks			2
' mums have mentioned to me that their child has pointed at a postcard or painting and recognised it and said " that 's @entity74 " , ' she said			2
it does this by presenting them with numerous flashcards - printed with numbers , world flags and even classical art - for less than one second at a time the program 's participants include the likes of 16 - month - old @entity84 , who has been attending the classes since she was five - months - old and speaks bits of @entity88 , @entity4 and @entity89 at home ' i think we underestimate what babies can absorb and their intelligence and i think that they are very ready			1
it 's great , it ca n't do any harm and she loves it , ' one student 's mother , @entity98 , said the program 's participants include the likes of 16 - month - old @entity84 , who has been attending the classes since she was five - months - old and speaks bits of @entity88 , @entity4 and @entity89 at home			1
' this is obviously helping her and we put her against other children and she 's doing a lot better than those other children her age , ' her father , @entity103 , said			2
similarly , @entity110 has also been attending since she was five - months - old and speaks @entity111 , @entity4 @entity112 and @entity88 at home			1
' i think we underestimate what babies can absorb and their intelligence and i think that they are very ready			0
it 's great , it ca n't do any harm and she loves it , ' her mother @entity98 told @entity50			2
the centre 's superstar , @entity120 , is an astonishing example who at the age of 18 - months can already count to 30 in @entity4 and ten in @entity126 ' if they like it they like it , if they do n’t they do n’t			1
my view is never to pressure or push			2
you just introduce and if they take to it that ’s great , ' @entity120 's mother @entity134 said			0

@entity154 - @entity153 , @entity9 's @entity155 and managing director denied that the early education school promoted ' @entity158 '			1
coined by author @entity160 , whose disciplinary rules include no sleepovers , no play dates , no television and no grades under an a , a @entity159 practices strict parenting methods which enforce competitive learning at the expense of a child 's social life			0
but ms @entity153 assures that the method has nothing to do with @entity9 and claims she wants to tell @entity158 to ' relax '			1
' children , they can be self - motivated to want to learn , they can love learning			0
they do not need to be forced , ' she said			0
' the first three years are really important because up to 80 per cent of the brain is basically developed by the time your three - years - old , ' @entity154 - @entity153 , @entity9 's @entity177 and managing director said but the extra education does not just stop in the early years			1
primary school students as young as kindergarten students are attending two hour after - school tuition classes up to twice a week to improve their chances of making it into a selective school ' we have kids who are suffering from severe anxiety disorders at the age of 4 or 5 because they are being asked to do things they are not developmentally ready for , ' @entity192 , an expert in child brain development , said ' the first three years are really important because up to 80 per cent of the brain is basically developed by the time your three - years - old			1
' but the extra education does not just stop in the early years			0
primary school students from as early as kindergarten are attending two hour after - school tuition classes up to twice a week to improve their chances of making it into a selective high school			0
but while the children interviewed by @entity50 were adamant that they could easily manage the extra work load , associate professor and expert in child brain development @entity192 , said that elevated stress levels in children could hinder their ability to learn			0
' we have kids who are suffering from severe anxiety disorders at the age of four or five because they are being asked to do things they are not developmentally ready for , ' he said			1
' this notion that somehow you can hyper stimulate or improve a child 's brain in the early years by getting them to do certain things has not been supported by any evidence			2
' instead , mr @entity192 said that similar results can be achieved by parents simply dedicating their time to their children			0
' you need to spend time with your children , you need to read with them , you need to talk with them , you need to enjoy the world around you with them , ' he told @entity50 .			0
