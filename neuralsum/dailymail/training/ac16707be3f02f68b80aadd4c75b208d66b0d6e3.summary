@entity1 's fancy dress caper was a beauty @entity3 is a ' @entity4 ' by @entity5 published : 18:41 est , 11 january 2014 updated : 18:41 est , 11 january 2014 almost 18 months have passed since @entity7 uttered that memorably self - pitying remark : ' it 's tough being me			1
' at the time , he was threatening to retire from @entity11 , alienating the bulk of @entity14 's cricketers and secretly texting members of the @entity17 team with insults aimed at his captain , @entity19			1
before that turbulent august was done , the eminently decent @entity19 would retire from the @entity11 arena , @entity7 would be temporarily banished from the @entity14 team and @entity24 cricket would be in a state of rancorous turmoil			1
yet still there were those who defended him ; showbiz back - slappers and starstruck flatterers for the most part			1
box office : but @entity7 's powers may be on the wane ' genius obeys its own rules , ' they told us			1
' it 's what being @entity7 is all about			1
' or , as @entity7 himself portentously put it : ' i am who i am			1
' at the close of 2012 , @entity14 's new young captain @entity46 would utter this fervent prayer : ' @entity49 , hopefully , will be a healer and we will be able to move on			1
' does that situation ring the faintest of bells ? well , it should because poisonous hostility is once more the order of the day and the usual suspect is at its centre			1
once again , a senior figure in the @entity14 hierarchy has had his fill of our @entity60			2
another decent man , the coach @entity62 , apparently finds himself unable to work with his most accomplished player			2
as ever , the details are obscure			2
@entity62 is saying little , while @entity7 is practising his enigmatic shrug , leaving his faithful luvvies to leak their loaded version of events			2
but as the artless lobbying intensifies , so the bruised and battered @entity24 game sinks a little more deeply into the mire			2
it is as if we had learned nothing from the @entity75 , nor from that shameful business of january 2009 when , as @entity14 captain , @entity7 attempted a miserably maladroit coup against the @entity14 coach @entity79 , as a result of which @entity79 was sacked and @entity7 lost a job he should never have been given			2
here we should enter the standard caveat			2
at his best , @entity7 is a batsman of princely command and imagination			2
his shot - making is gloriously audacious and , when the mood is upon him , he can tailor the game to his own talents			2
it should also be said that those gifts have not been much in evidence these past few weeks			2
his faithful supporters protest that he scored more runs than any other @entity14 batsmen in the recent series			2
dilemma : @entity14 may be forced to choose between the civilised eminence of @entity62 and the simmering selfregard of @entity7 perfectly true but 294 at a pauper 's average of 29.40 scarcely suggests wholesale plunder			1
and the nature of his performances , those distracted dismissals from airy wafts , carried hints of a 33 - year - old whose powers may be on the wane			2
naturally , the true believers will hear none of this			2
why , @entity115 wants him appointed vice-captain , on the grounds that he would flourish with a taste of responsibility			2
but if the vice-captaincy could work such wonders , then the captaincy itself would surely transform @entity14 's fortunes			1
recalling @entity7 's previous tenancy , which lasted for precisely three test matches , i doubt that the experiment will come to pass			1
in any case , we should do well to remember his history			0
he flounced out of his native @entity17 , following a bogus tiff over the quota system			0
he incited ructions at @entity135 , which led to captain @entity136 hurling his kit from the dressing - room balcony			0
he made a peremptory departure from @entity140 , having discovered it was a long way from his home in @entity143 : ' geographically , it does n't work , ' he explained			0
and his departure from the @entity14 captaincy provoked one of the more earthshaking explosions in the long and frequently turbulent history of @entity24 cricket			0
the factor which all these altercations had in common , as his chums will readily testify , is that @entity7 was in no way to blame , he was always an innocent bystander , it was invariably someone else 's fault			1
just as it is in the present spat with @entity62			0
the ham - fisted propagandists are already at work ; we may sacrifice a coach but a genius is irreplaceable ; @entity7 is the victim of an @entity166 conspiracy ; why , i have even seen it suggested that we can not lose @entity7 as he is ' box office ' , as if the @entity14 team should be selected on television ratings			0
well , the saga has run its course			0
if we really are forced to choose between the civilised eminence of @entity174 and the simmering selfregard of @entity7 , there is no choice to be made			0
@entity7 should be directed towards the @entity177 , where so much of his fortune has been made , and @entity14 should be free to follow a new , saner course			0
@entity46 's prayer was admirable , yet misplaced			1
for where @entity7 is concerned , nobody moves on			0
they simply hold their breath and await the next eruption			0
@entity186 : @entity1 in ill - advised fancy dress outfit even by the standards of modern footballers , @entity1 's fancy dress caper was a beauty			1
hindsight may be easy but did nobody raise an eyebrow when he cried : ' look , folks ! i 'm a suicide bomber ' ? at any rate , it was a real tester for the ' representatives ' of the @entity201 defender			0
and they were magnificently equal to the task			0
' he dressed in a costume consisting of empty bottles of @entity208 and cans of @entity210 strapped to his chest in an attempted comedy play on the popular @entity214 drinks , ' they explained			0
it seemed impossible to overhaul @entity1 in the terminally tasteless stakes but his hired help brought it off			1
a man of courage puts football 's mob to shame two apparently unconnected images offered food for thought in a stormy sporting week			1
one was of the former @entity227 player , @entity228 , relaxed and smiling after announcing that he is gay			1
the other was of a neanderthal section of @entity232 supporters , faces contorted in mindless fury , screeching abuse at @entity235 as he was carried away from the @entity237 pitch with a serious knee injury			0
@entity240 decision : @entity228 @entity228 , with 52 caps for @entity242 , retired from the game last september			1
he says he was warned about the possibility of a hostile reaction to his revelation , so he felt able to come out only when his career was over			0
the points he makes are thoughtful and revealing			0
' the perceived contradiction between playing football , the man 's game , and being homosexual is nonsense , ' he says			1
' you hear the word " courage " a lot			1
that 's nice to hear but it 's part of the problem , of course			1
i sincerely hope we 'll see the time when nobody mentions courage in these circumstances any more because it will be seen as totally normal that a sportsperson will speak about his homosexuality , the way others talk about their wives and girlfriends			1
' injury blow : @entity235 was ruled out for the season now , only the profoundly uncivilised could disagree with a word of that , which takes us back to that other image , the rabid mob at @entity281			1
@entity235 had merely reminded opposing fans that @entity237 were leading by two goals to nil			0
consider what such people - and their kindred spirits up and down the land - might have made of a player who was not only enormously talented but openly gay			0
the venom which such a man would attract is all too easily imagined			0
mercifully , i believe that the tide is turning and that homophobia disgusts the decent majority , who take the view that a footballer 's sexuality is of no concern to anybody but himself			1
yet the first active player to come out will face problems			0
at first , he will be reviled by knuckle - draggers around the country			0
but , ultimately , enlightenment will dawn			0
it will take patience , determination and something more			0
while he may not care for the word , it is a quality which @entity228 possesses in abundance			1
@entity317 @entity3 , @entity318 's new manager , has always seemed a cheery , uncomplicated fellow			1
but look closely and you may discern the chip on his shoulder			0
he explains his failure to succeed in the @entity177 with this spot of populist prattle : ' if i had a fair crack , with a budget as good as some , i believe i can do it			0
but i 'm going to have to get there - i 'm not one of these foreign fellas who comes in because he has known @entity334 for 10 minutes			0
' one hesitates to call @entity3 , of all people , a ' @entity4 '			1
but , sadly , the cap seems to fit .			0

@entity1 's fancy dress caper was a beauty
@entity228 courage puts football 's mob to shame
@entity3 is a ' @entity4 '
