sex is the top topic on voyeuristic site @entity3 , where subscribers post anonymous diary entries online new anti-social network @entity6 , which allows users to publish anonymous diaries online , reveals a salacious peek into the country 's private lives			1
on subscribing , users input their postcode , which is kept private to voyeurs but has allowed the site to conduct extremely revealing research			1
the research found that @entity19 ’ journals on the female dominated site are three times more likely to focus on sex than those living outside the capital			1
londoners were also nearly three times more likely to have a career that ’s disruptive to their relationship and were over four times more likely to have an affair because of a career or with someone within the same company			1
but despite certain differences , the most popular tag by the site ’s 5,000 users whether they lived in or outside of @entity38 was ‘ sex ’			1
uploaded journals - which allow users to anonymously post 200 words about their lives each day alongside music , videos or photos - were twice as likely to discuss sex over ‘ career ’ and close to three times more likely to focus on sex over ‘ love ’ ( where not relating to sex )			1
@entity0 made up 15 % of all entries , half of which showed an emphasis on infidelity			1
new relationships were the second most popular subject matter and careers was third , appearing in just under 8 % of posts			2
@entity6 founder @entity63 explains , ' we conducted experiments using key word search on several batches of users that had known postcodes , so they could be separated into " in @entity38 " and " out of @entity38 "			1
' whilst the subjects were the same : sex , relationships , career and love , the way each was discussed starkly differed			1
' the biggest trend was that out of @entity38 , the top subjects were treated as quite separate items			1
if they talked about relationships it was about a relationship and nothing else			1
in @entity38 , journals of relationships included heavy references to career and sex			1
' in @entity38 , sex was more often linked to infidelity , usually through work , quite often with someone from work and explained by the pressures of work			1
' on @entity98 subscribers post their most private thoughts online but their identity remains unknown according to dr. @entity102 , consultant psychologist and clinical director of @entity38 - based @entity104 ( www.citypsychology.com ) , ' these results confirm that women focus on sex despite the socially constructed belief that they do n't as much as men			1
' it is perhaps the anonymity of this site that provides them with a safe place without judgement to do so			2
' it is unsurprising that those living high - pressured lives will often link other seemingly unrelated aspects with their career and job challenges			2
' given the amount of hours that people spend at work these days especially in the capital , it ’s understandable that sex and romantic relationships are increasingly occurring in occupational contexts and often affecting or being affected by work			1
' furthermore , the fast paced , competitive and instant gratification culture that exists in cities coupled with more people , available options and choice clearly impact the sexual behaviour of people living and working there			2
' there are already over 4.5 million words posted on the site : the equivalent of 50 average - sized novels			2
@entity143 : waiting for a life extract 1 : something strange is going on as you know , @entity147 ( my ex ) came and stayed with me a few days whilst @entity151 was away			2
it was so good to spend time with @entity147			0
it reminded me why i loved him and what we once had together and for a millisecond i was transported back to those days and was wondering why we split up - but i soon came to			0
it seems , however , that @entity147 stayed in that dream state			0
he rang today and left a message saying he very much likes mr @entity162 but that if i ever felt			0
i was shocked and super angry			0
what on earth does he think he 's up to ? telling me that i am even more beautiful than before , that i am a lady and have a " real sophistication " does n't mean i am going to go running to him			0
sure , he has money galore , looks that stop women in the street , manners of a true gentleman and tastes in culture that make me want to swoon but then there 's mr @entity176 extract 2 : waiting for a life the @entity6 homepage is bursting with secrets waiting to be read i woke up this morning with dread in my mind			2
it is such an awful feeling			0
it is worse than a panic attack ( for me ) because it is all consuming and lasts for weeks sometimes			0
i know what it is about and have looked for help to shake it off but no one seems to be able to help			0
even meditation does n't help			0
it is all about the fact that i feel like i am an empty shell , that i have lived my life in fast forward , that it has been so packed up with experiences that now it has come to a stand still			0
my childhood has consumed ' me ' and there is no way to escape the issue that i have nothing , nothing , to look forward to			0
oh sure i have the odd bit and bob but there is nothing that will change my life , turn it on its head , and i seem to need that			0
i know i should be content with what i have but i feel ...			0
. i do n't know			0
words do n't cover it .			0
