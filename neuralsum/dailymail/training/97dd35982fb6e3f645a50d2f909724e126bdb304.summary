this is the incredible moment a unsuspecting wildebeest was attacked by crocodile and a hippopotamus at exactly the same time while drinking from an @entity5 river			1
the stunning photographs were taken by amateur photographer @entity7 , 27 , on a visit to the @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11			1
he said the wildebeest was drinking the water when a hungry crocodile appeared out of nowhere and launched its attack			1
seconds later a furious hippo joined the fight after apparently becoming irritated that the battle to the death was going on so close to where it was wading			2
the thrashing caught the attention of a nearby hippo , which became aggravated and initiated a fierce three - way tussle			1
an hour of fighting then ensued , with the wildebeest thrashing and trying to make its escape while the crocodile attempted to tear at its flesh and the hippo tired to sink its massive incisors in to struggling animals back			1
to make matters worse a pack of hungry hyenas gathered at the waters edge hoping to pick off the wounded wildebeest should it manage to make it out of the water			2
eventually the exhausted wildebeest gave up the fight , allowing the crocodile to have its dinner and the hippo to return to its wading			1
the hyenas , needless to say , went hungry			0

@entity169 was drinking from @entity9 in @entity11 's @entity10
a hungry crocodile attacked the unsuspecting animal and dragged it down in to the water

fighting went on for more than an hour until the wildebeest was exhausted and gave up its fight for life
crocodile then set about eating the animal while the hippo returned to wading in the water
