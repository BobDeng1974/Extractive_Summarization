@entity0 says that far from over- 50s reconciling themselves to becoming invisible , this is when women take greater pride in their appearance the air was heady as hundreds of women , ranging in age from 35 to 70 , wafted fragrantly into the room			1
but even more arresting was the fact that , without exception , it was those over 50 who ’d really pulled out all the stops at the charity event i was speaking at			1
each one was not just expensively perfumed , but expertly made - up and dressed to the nines			2
while some of the younger ones looked rather like they ’d just fallen out of bed , or rushed the kids to school without brushing their hair , the loos were crowded with women of a certain age re-applying their lippy and checking for @entity29 in the mirror			1
you might , if you wished to be unkind , call this an exercise in mass vanity			2
and in many ways , i would be inclined to agree — only i refuse to accept being called vain as a criticism , and claim it as a compliment instead			1
contrary to the notion that once past a certain age it ’s hardly worth bothering , because men stop noticing you anyway , i find it immensely cheering that , far from over- 50s reconciling themselves to becoming invisible , this is when women take an even greater pride in their appearance			1
a pride which only increases as the years go by			1
that ’s not to say that i cared any less about my appearance in my 30s than i do now , although i certainly devoted less time to it			1
going fresh - faced and natural may have given the illusion of modesty , but it was simply a viable option			2
now in my 60s , the no make - up look equals drained and decrepit , rather than carefree , so no wonder it takes me a good half hour longer to leave the house			2
i sometimes even put on make - up when i ’m not planning to go out at all , in order not to depress myself when i pass the mirror in my bathroom			2
whereas once i could wash and go in 20 minutes flat , my hair has now thinned and needs washing and painstakingly blow - drying every second day			2
and to fill in the ever - widening parting , i have to sprinkle on @entity73 , tiny hair fibres that fill the gaps and make it look thicker			2
these days i do n’t even go out to walk the dog without a slick of lipstick and a quick brush of the mascara wand			1
vain as that may seem , i am not alone			1
although i knew few of the women at my table at this charity brunch , i soon found myself engaged in banter about our lives and our families			1
one , well into her 60s , giggled as she told me that her 38 - year - old daughter was finally getting married			0
these days @entity0 does n't even go out to walk the dog without a slick of lipstick and a quick brush of the mascara wand			1
vain as that may seem , she says she is not alone as other middle aged women feel similarly ‘ i told her a decade ago that she needed to hurry up because i wanted to wear a sleeveless dress at her wedding ! but it ’s taken her a whole ten years , and now i ’m going to have to wear sleeves ! ’ @entity106 , certainly , but not without self - knowledge and a sense of humour			1
another sexagenarian , a breast cancer survivor with a penchant for short skirts and leopard - print ankle boots , described herself to me as ‘ wayward ’			0
‘ i like to look a bit different , ’ she said			0
having lost her confidence while going through chemotherapy , when her hair grew back she ditched the blonde dye she ’d previously used to disguise her greys , and reverted to the auburn of her youth that speaks not of narcissism , but of renewed vitality			0
the town @entity106 in @entity125 held a perpetual fair , trading in frivolous goods as for me , who spends all day communing with my computer and does n’t exactly need to buy myself smart daywear , i confess the minute i accepted the charity ’s invitation to speak — and before i ’d even given a moment ’s thought to what i was going to say — my attention turned first to what i was going to wear			0
only when i had splashed out on a dress , nude tights and a pair of heels that looked the biz , and hurt like hell , did i get down to writing my speech			0
vain ? yes , but i ’m in no doubt that feeling and looking good only aided my delivery			1
why should vanity become a dirty word , when we women are praised from childhood for prettiness , and complimented on how we look ? when i was little , whenever we went away on holiday , my ever - glamorous mother would clutch her vanity case to her bosom as though it housed the crown jewels			1
to me , it had an aura of magic : turning the tiny golden key and flipping the mirrored leather lid , i would marvel at the array of lotions and potions that make up a woman ’s beauty armoury , corralled in their hand - stitched compartments			0
no wonder the word vanity came to have positive connotations for me			0
as teenagers , my girlfriends and i would spend far too long peering into mirrors , trying on clothes we could n’t afford , encouraging each other to experiment with make - up			0
it was a means of bonding , a collective vanity that , ironically , paved the way to a collective sisterhood that still holds firm			0
there may be much to be said for the @entity187 approach to life , whereby the sheer force of your confidence , intellect and charisma allows you to cast aside the trivial pursuits of fashion , cosmetics and regular haircuts			0
but what ’s wrong with having surfaces , as well as depths ? why should n’t women break through the glass ceiling in @entity204 lipstick and @entity206 mascara ? when @entity208 star @entity208 took ermine recently in the @entity209 , she was mocked by this paper ’s own sketch writer for the height of her heels , the quantities of slap she wore and her highlighted hair : ‘ groomed as though for @entity217 ’			1
well , i wanted to yell bravo , because in my eyes her glamour only enhanced , rather than diminished , her success			0
i felt the same , a fortnight ago , when @entity221 , 69 , become the new face of @entity223			0
though i wish she were n’t the only older woman being wheeled out as proof that our generation can cut it in the beauty stakes , her appointment only affirmed my belief that , however time has withered me , rather than giving up on my looks , they ’re still worth taking care of			0
hold on to your vanity with hoops of steel i say			0
i ’m not talking about an artificial attempt to hold back the years — to convince the world you ’re 40 when you ’re 50 , or to succumb to the surgeon ’s knife — but a commitment to making the most of yourself , and looking and feeling the very best of your age .			0
