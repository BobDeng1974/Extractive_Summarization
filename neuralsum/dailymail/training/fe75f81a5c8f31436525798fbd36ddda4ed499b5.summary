by @entity0 published : 16:44 est , 8 september 2013 updated : 05:15 est , 9 september 2013 after the heartbreak of seven miscarriages , @entity1 was overjoyed when she finally gave birth to a healthy girl			1
she and her husband @entity6 could at last could dare to dream of the large family they ’d always wanted			2
but they had not banked on seeing their wish come true quite so quickly – after a second successful pregnancy produced triplets , with no ivf			1
@entity6 and @entity1 with 2 - year - old daughter @entity15 and the new triplets @entity0 , @entity17 and @entity18 who were born on august 6 mr @entity19 , 35 , an aircraft engineer , told of the moment the couple , who married in 2009 , learned they would be having three more children			1
he said : ‘ looking at the scan monitor in hospital we could n’t believe our eyes			2
‘ there , plain to see , were three pairs of arms and legs , and three tiny heads			2
so we both sat there with our mouths open			0
’ mrs @entity1 said : ‘ it ’s a bit ironic , really , after all the miscarriages , then to be having triplets			1
it seemed like someone was having a laugh upstairs			1
’ she added : ‘ @entity6 was like “ i ca n’t afford four kids ” , and i was like “ how did this happen ? how am i going to carry three ? ! ”			0
’ despite their repeated failure to have a child , the couple , from @entity46 near @entity47 , never tried @entity14 as doctors could not find a medical reason for the miscarriages			1
@entity18 , @entity0 and @entity17 were born at 33 weeks on august 6 , and were taken home just 10 days later mrs @entity1 said : ‘ we had tests , but they just said , “ it ’s just one of those things and if you can bear it just keep trying ”			1
‘ we went to two different hospitals , but they could n’t find anything , they said it was just bad luck , really			0
’ but she refused to give up			0
‘ i just thought , “ well , we ’ll keep trying ”			0
’ then two years ago mrs cash ’s eighth pregnancy gave the couple their first child , @entity69			2
and earlier this year the couple were astounded to learn that she was pregnant again – and carrying triplets			2
bursting with pride : @entity1 said on the day of the triplets ' birth she was ready to ' get them out '			1
they arrived by caesarean section a minute apart from one another on august 6 , mrs cash , 35 , gave birth to identical boys @entity0 and @entity17 , and a girl , @entity18			0
delivered by caesarean section at 33 - and - a - half weeks – as is the norm for triplets – they weighed just over four - and - a - half pounds each			2
mrs @entity1 said : ‘ on the day itself i was like , “ get them out ! i ’ve had enough now ! ” ’ the babies each arrived a minute apart – first the boys , both at 4lbs 9oz , followed by @entity18 at 4lbs 8oz			1
mrs @entity1 said : ‘ they all came out crying ; they were like a litter of kittens , with little tiny cries			1
’ the delivery at the @entity91 in @entity47 was straightforward and despite being premature , the triplets were home in ten days			2
the babies are thriving – but telling the boys apart is a challenge , so the proud parents have left @entity0 ’s hospital tag on for now			0
mr @entity19 said : ‘ we always wanted a big family			1
but just having two kids was proving difficult			0
but now we ’ve got an instant larger brood			0
’ the couple have new challenges – they can not fit four baby seats into their car and have to rely on the grandparents for a lift			0
but mrs @entity1 is relishing her new family			1
‘ it ’s really nice			0
and i do n’t ever need to be pregnant ever again			0
imagine if it was another three ? blimey ! ’			0

@entity1 and @entity19 suffered years of failed pregnancies
triplets conceived *naturally* after doctors *encouraged* ' just keep trying '
mr @entity19 twist of fate felt like ' someone was having a laugh upstairs '
