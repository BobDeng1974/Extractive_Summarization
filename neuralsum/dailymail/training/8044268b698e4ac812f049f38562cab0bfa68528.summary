by @entity0 four @entity2 fishermen who were searching for crabs in a river have accidentally discovered what is believed to be a @entity7 bomber			1
the men were trauling through the @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 , eastern @entity2 's @entity12 , when they came across the wreckage			1
it took two days to salvage the plane which is thought to be a b - 25 bomber from the ' @entity18 ' squadron , a special unit of @entity21 pilots tasked with training @entity2 forces in air combat			1
@entity24 discovered the wreckage which in a river in @entity12 , @entity2 while looking for crab a @entity21 scholar has suggested the bomber could belong to the ' @entity18 ' squadron which protected @entity2 from @entity32 forces during the war the plane 's undercarriage , engine and fuselage were recovered from the river , still bearing a @entity39 engraving			1
the aircraft 's plate is inscribed with a serial number and date of manufacture , indicating it was built in february 1943			2
however , this would suggest the bomber was in fact not part of the squadron which ceased operations in @entity2 in 1942 , a year earlier			0
it is possible the plane belonged to the @entity53 which flew operations throughout the country until the end of the war			0
also known as the first @entity57 of @entity58 , the ' @entity18 ' were made up by members of the @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62			0
the aircraft still bears a ' @entity39 ' inscription as well as a date of manufacture of 1943 the b - 25 bomber is one of the most distinctive among all individual fighter aircraft the group consisted of three fighter squadron which each contained around 20 aircraft			2
having trained in @entity74 before @entity21 entry into the @entity7 , it was the squadrons ' duty to protect @entity2 forces from @entity32 attack			1
their bombers are among some of the most recognisable of any individual combat aircraft , with distinctive shark - faced noses			0
the @entity85 ( right ) and members of the ' @entity18 ' squadron , ( left ) unlike the ' @entity18 ' who were recruited under presidential authority , the @entity53 was a joint organisation between the @entity90 and the @entity91			0
jointly commanded by both @entity21 and @entity2 officers , the unit remained operational until 1943 .			0
