by @entity0 there are some social situations where it might be advantageous if your clothes could enable you to merge into your surroundings and save you from an unwelcome encounter			0
now one textile designer in @entity9 has taken the first steps to creating clothing that can change colour like a chameleon			1
her experimental fabric can change colour in seconds using a number of electronic devices			1
‘ my main interest in textile design is the dynamically changing surfaces , structures , integrating interactive technologies into textiles			2
in my works i ’m looking for new ways of interaction between human and textile , ’ she wrote on her blog			2
the fabric , which comprises her @entity45 research project , consists of ‘ arduino [ a microcontroller ] with @entity50 power supply and 20 custom pcbs [ printed circuit boards ] driving and controlling 4 industrial @entity54 power supplies , that heat two handmade textile woven with nichrome wires and screen - printed with thermochromatic dying , revealing the pre-programmed patterns			2
’ a textile designer in @entity9 has taken the first steps to creating clothing that can change colour like a chameleon ( pictured )			1
the lizards have specialized cells - chromatophores - which contain pigments in their cytoplasm , in three layers below their transparent outer skin , but the fabric uses electronics to change colour making a mark : patterns on the fabric are generated from sound files and heat			0
people also can leave traces on the surface by touching it ( pictured ) she created her fabric to turn digital media into textile art. ‘ chromosonic research project investigates how the world of digital media becomes tangible through the textile medium			1
my intention was the broadening the field of textile craft and design to media design			0
’ two slow moving textile ‘ displays ’ show the content			1
they react to environmental changes such as heat and pressure by changing colour and pattern			2

chain reaction : two slow moving textile ' displays ' show the content and react to environmental changes such as heat and pressure by changing the colour and pattern of the fabric ( pictured ) ‘ the patterns are generated from sound files			1
the heat sensitive static patterns create dynamically changing patterns			0
the spectators also can leave traces on the surface through the sense of touch			0
’ she told @entity124 : ’ i think that in the future it can be developed to the next level , to become wearable , involving more experts from electronics and the it sector			0
‘ but it was n't my intention as it is an installation			0
i think it provides many opportunities for further reflection and it can be a food for thought			0
’ would you wear hardware ? @entity25 created the interactive fabric using computer programming , engineering and electronic devices ( pictured ) fashion fast forward : ms @entity25 told @entity124 that one day her innovation could be developed to the next level to become wearable , involving more experts from electronics and the it sector to embed the necessary electronics ( pictured ) into the main body of the fabric			1

@entity25 *'s* fabric *includes* two slow moving textile ‘ displays ’ to show the content , which react to environmental changes
it changes colour and pattern when heated up or pressed
she plans on working with it experts and engineers to develop the fabric further , but at the moment it is ' food for thought '
