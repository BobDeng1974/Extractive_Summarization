by @entity0 published : 10:03 est , 28 february 2013 updated : 01:39 est , 1 march 2013 shocking : a @entity2 mother has admitted she feeds her baby pureed cheeseburgers as she can not cook a thing a mother totally ill - equipped for parenthood has approached the authorities for help after admitting she feeds her baby pureed cheeseburgers because she can not cook			1
experts believe this grave situation is mirrored all over @entity14 because a generation with little or no parenting skills is bringing up their children on a diet of fast food			1
significant numbers of youngsters also arrive at primary school not toilet trained and can not even use a knife and fork , according the @entity26			1
many of these households say they are too poor to buy items like fruit and vegetables as costs continue to rocket , but the truth is far too many can not cook at all , family support groups say			0
and despite courses being run all over the country helping parents to cook and look after their children better , many do not go because they feel ' judged ' and fear their child will be taken into care			1
members of @entity43 in @entity44 heard from the local woman who pureed cheeseburgers from a fast food restaurant for her child because she did n't know how to cook			2
independent child poverty expert @entity49 , who chairs the commission , admitted she ' gulped ' out loud after hearing the claims			0
another woman who was given a carrot also admitted she had no idea what it was , she said			2
the @entity26 also heard community services were trusted more than local government services by struggling families			0
@entity59 , ceo of the @entity60 , said : ' @entity61 has set an excellent example in making their child poverty meetings public and the @entity60 hopes that they and other local authorities make use of the many tools available to tackle this difficult situation , such as running family @entity70 clubs , or offering cookery training for professionals working with these families			0
' good , nutritious food throughout childhood but particularly in a child ’s early years is critical to healthy development – it is a vital factor not only in preventing obesity but also in performance at school			2
sadly , in many cases family cooking skills have been lost through over generations , not helped by the loss for many years of cookery from the school curriculum			2
' this week a nationwide survey of children 's eating habits found they are being sent to school with cold chips or a packet of biscuits in their lunchbox			1
one reason behind the food children are taking with them is that the value of money has plummeted by two - thirds over the last 30 years as the cost of everyday goods rockets			0
a three-fold increase in retail prices means that someone would need £ 299 today to have the equivalent purchasing power of £ 100 back in 1982 , according to the @entity60			0
worrying : many new parents can not cook and are afraid the authorities will intervene if they seek help ( posed by models ) one person told the @entity60 that ' some children come in with just a packet of biscuits '			2
another said they had seen ' poorer quality sandwich fillings , sometimes just margarine '			0
the poll asked 253 adults , including youth workers , childminders , teachers , doctors and hospital staff , for their views on how children 's diets have changed			0
it found that more than four - fifths ( 84.6 per cent ) say that in the course of their work , they have seen children who they think are not getting enough to eat			0
a third person said ' some families only give cold cooked rice or cold chips with fishfingers or similar			1
' poor diet : adults working with children were surveyed about the quality of children 's food - and some reported packed lunches consisting of cold chips and fishfingers @entity149 said : ' people feel they 're not going to be judged and their children are n't going to be taken away from them			1
' @entity152 , from @entity153 , said many families choose not to use children 's centres at all because ' they feel they 're being watched and their parenting is being challenged			1
