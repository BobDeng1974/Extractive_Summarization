you have to admire @entity1			2
not only is he facing the challenge of trying to improve @entity3 without @entity4 , he has set himself another challenge by signing @entity6			1
the @entity8 forward is at times brilliant , and other times impossible			1
one thing is for certain so far in his career though : there is a consistent pattern to @entity6 ’s behaviour - when things are going well , he ’ll be fine			1
if times are difficult , he could be a liability			2
his best spell at @entity18 came during a run in 2011 when they were on a nine - game winning streak which included their 6 - 1 victory at @entity24			1
@entity6 scored six goals in five games in that period			2
liability ? @entity6 , seen here watching @entity3 's match at his former club @entity18 on monday , poses a unique set of challenges for @entity1 back in @entity33 : @entity6 has joined @entity3 from @entity34 for £ 16m unpredictable : @entity6 can be fantastic and frustrating in equal measure			1
he is pictured showing off his famous ' @entity37 ? ' t - shirt in @entity18 's 6 - 1 win at @entity39 in 2011 but later that season , when @entity41 needed his prodigal son to deliver at @entity43 , @entity18 lost 1 - 0 , fell eight points off the pace at the top , and @entity6 committed two horrible challenges to get himself sent off			1
@entity41 was a sad sorry sight trying to persuade his striker to leave the field when he was reluctant to go			0
with @entity6 suspended , @entity18 went on a winning run to seal the title			1
and with things going so well , of course , the @entity53 was happy to help out , laying on that sensational winning goal from @entity57 against @entity58 in injury time – @entity6 ’s only assist during his time with @entity18			1
it was the only time he featured during that winning streak			0
@entity6 ’s a player who let @entity41 down badly , and the former @entity18 boss was @entity6 ’s father figure , the manager who trusted him and supported him more than any other			1
if @entity6 is prepared to do that to his father - figure , then good luck @entity1			1
a bad challenge on a team - mate at the @entity18 training ground led to @entity41 and @entity6 having a scuffle in front of photographers , and the player was sold a month later			1
witnesses described the challenge as ' horrific ' and ' seemingly pre-meditated			0
' it was n’t the first time he had clashed with a colleague at the training ground			0
flashpoint : @entity6 clashed with ' father - figure ' @entity41 on the training ground back in january 2013 red mist : @entity6 is shown a red card by referee @entity86 during a match with @entity43 in april 2012 work cut out : @entity1 could have a difficult task in keeping @entity6 on the straight and narrow red cards and bans at @entity18 were too frequent			1
reckless challenges on @entity95 ’s @entity94 in the @entity96 , @entity98 ’s @entity97 and @entity43 ’s @entity99 in the @entity100			0
oh , and he got a four - match ban for stamping on @entity103 ’s head			0
maybe @entity6 has changed but there is no evidence of that			2
@entity34 had grown tired of the problems he created – he was banned for three games for insulting an opponent and a referee after the final whistle when @entity34 were beaten by @entity112			0
and towards the end of last season , @entity6 clashed with journalists and turned himself into a victim who claimed he was being attacked by half of @entity8			0
this is the kind of nonsense that can affect a player ’s game , and certainly affects @entity6			2
inconsistency in his behaviour and performance ( i ’m not even talking about controversy away from football ) is @entity6 ’s trademark			2
at @entity130 he looked sensational ; when @entity8 were knocked out of the @entity131 this summer he was booked for dissent and substituted at half time			0
power - packed : @entity6 drills home his second goal for @entity8 against @entity135 in the @entity130 semi-final ripped : and celebrates in his own inimitable style sub-par : but @entity6 was unable to repeat that form at the @entity140 in @entity141 @entity6 could be a reformed character			2
@entity1 might be the manager @entity6 has been searching for			2
neither of those things are certain though , so that ’s why the signing is a risk			0
people have told me there is no downside to the @entity6 signing			0
really ? sounds like people trying to convince themselves it ’s a great bit of business			0
what if he decides to launch another ' horrific ' challenge in training on a team - mate ? or if he feels the urge to throw a dart at a youth team player as he did at @entity18 ? what if he is still one of the worst trainers football has ever seen – what kind of example does that set to some of the youngsters currently working hard for @entity1 ? it could all mean a lot of time spent on managing one individual player , when i ’m sure @entity1 could spend that time more profitably doing other things			1
based on his career so far , @entity6 will be a great signing – but only when things are going well			0
he ’s got it all to prove			0
from what we saw from him at @entity18 , how do you think he would have reacted had he been part of the @entity3 team that were well beaten in the end at the @entity188 on monday night ? for @entity3 ’s sake , i hope @entity6 has grown up			1
if he has n’t , it could be a big blemish on @entity1 ’ so far excellent cv .			0

@entity1 has taken a brave step in bringing @entity6 from @entity34 to @entity3 in a £ 16m deal
@entity6 's behaviour is at times brilliant , and at other times impossible
he could prove a liability at *pressured* moments , as @entity18 found
@entity1 may have to spend time man - managing just one player , when his entire side needs attention
@entity3 lost 3 - 1 at @entity18 on monday night
