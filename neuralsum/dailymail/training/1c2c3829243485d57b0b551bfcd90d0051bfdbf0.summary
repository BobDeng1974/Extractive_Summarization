dr @entity0 , the presenter of @entity2 's medical reality show @entity3 , has revealed he has an embarrassing problem of his own			1
the doctor has suffered from a thinning hairline ever since a battle with pneumonia left him with weakened follicles , and has since been the subject of cruel jibes on @entity12			1
users have taken to the social networking site with comments such as ' great body , pity about the hair ' , and simply ' you 've got s * * * hair ' , leading the doctor to spend £ 5,500 on hair implants with a leading celebrity surgeon in @entity24			1
before : dr @entity0 , who has thinning hair due to a battle with pneumonia , before he had £ 5,500 hair implants at dr @entity30 's @entity29 in @entity24 before and after : ' i am really pleased i have had it done again - the techniques have improved a lot in the four years since i had the first one ' dr @entity0 , 36 , already had thinning hair before suffering from a debilitating bout of pneumonia last year , resulting in further hair loss			1
he explained : ' most of my hair grew back after the pneumonia but there was just a bit less			1
any serious illness can result in hair loss			1
the same thing can happen to women after they give birth			0
' he had already had an implant operation four years earlier , but realised his hair could do with a second boost and was delighted when surgeon @entity30 at @entity24 's @entity53 offered to help			1
he transplanted 3,000 hairs from the back to the front of dr @entity0 's scalp			1
dr @entity0 said : ' i had n't realised that there was an option for a second hair transplant			1
when i was told it was possible , i thought it would be good to make my hair thicker at the front			1
there were also a few gaps which need filling			0
' i am really pleased i have had it done again			0
the techniques have improved a lot in the four years since i had the first one			0
' after : dr @entity0 had a hair implant operation four years ago , but his hair began thinning even more after pneumonia so he had another he added : ' i am very pleased that i had it done - it has been very empowering for me			1
' i thought to myself , " why am i always telling people how to change things about their bodies that they dislike if i ca n't do the same thing for myself ? " ' we view cosmetic surgery for men and women so differently			0
having a boob job for a woman is seen as such an everyday thing these days , but for a man to have a hair transplant is seen as a far bigger step			1
' there are so many men out there who want to have this done but do n't dare			0
i just hope by talking about it openly that i will remove some of the stigma attached to men having cosmetic procedures			0
' it 's great that other celebrities with transplants like @entity104 and @entity105 have gone public as well			1
' it may mean that more do not suffer in silence			0
when a transplant is done well , it can really transform your life			0
' hair today : dr @entity0 - pictured left before operation , right after - had 1,800 grafts ( 3,000 individual hairs ) transplanted in a procedure known as @entity118 up 30 per cent of male hair transplant patients end up having a second procedure , because while the transplanted hair from the first procedure remains permanent , they can carry on losing their natural hair			1
dr @entity0 had 1,800 grafts ( 3,000 individual hairs ) transplanted in a procedure known as @entity118			1
the operation involved taking a strip of hair from the back of his scalp , then dividing it into individual hairs and planting them like seedlings into his hairline			1
it will take up to a year for the transplanted hair to fully grow back			2
both of dr @entity0 's transplants were carried out by the surgeon @entity30 who has worked with a number of celebrities including @entity145 star @entity144 and the model @entity147			1
dr @entity0 had his first transplant with dr @entity30 in october 2009			1
he had always had naturally high temples and he disliked the ' curtains ' hair style he had at the time with a floppy fringe			2
operating theatre : dr @entity156 carrying out the procedure on dr @entity0			1
dr @entity0 from @entity2 's @entity3 at dr @entity30 's @entity29 in @entity24 for a hair transplant dr @entity0 , who works out up to six times a week , explained : ' i am not on tv for how i look			1
i am on tv because i am doctor , but i guess at first i did n't realise that your appearance is important and all part of the game			0
' i did get some pretty hurtful comments			0
some people would just say , ' " you 've got s * * * hair , " or they would write , " great body , pity about the hair			2
" ' after i had my first transplant all those negative comments stopped immediately and no one ever commented on my hair again			2
' i have to do a lot of photo shoots for my job and i had never really enjoyed them before			0
i may give the impression when i am on tv that this all comes very naturally to me , but believe me , it does n't			0
' the new hair really boosted my confidence			2
i found doing photoshoots much more bearable			0
' meet the doctors : dr @entity0 presents @entity3 on @entity2 with @entity191 , left , and @entity192 , right dr @entity0 said the fact that he worked out regularly had created an added pressure over his body image			1
he said : ' i 've slightly dug a hole for myself			0
i have always worked out and i guess i got known as the ' fit young doctor , ' though it was never a label i sought			0
there is then this enormous pressure to keep it up			0
' your name crops up on blogs , chat rooms and forums like @entity12			0
they are not talking about your medical skills or your bedside manner – they just comment on your looks			2
tv star : dr @entity0 works out up to six times a week ' after i went public after the first procedure i had so many emails asking me about it and where i had it done			1
you realise this is a very important issue to a lot of men			0
' i guess if they see someone like me making no secret of the fact that i have had it done it might make it okay for them to have it too			0
' i 'm not urging others to have it done			0
my message to men who are unhappy with their hair is to at least inquire			2
' and if you do decide to have it done , be very careful about the surgeon you chose			2
' dr @entity0 said he chose dr @entity30 because they had worked together on his @entity2 medical show @entity3			1
he said : ' we filmed him on the show after performing a hair transplant			1
the patient looked fantastic afterwards and i remember thinking , ' wow that is great			0
' ' it occurred to me that i could benefit in the same way			0
' dr @entity30 has a very nice manner and is very calm and i am very pleased with the results he gets			2
' dr @entity30 said he had enjoyed working with dr @entity0 for a second time			1
he said : ' i was able to fill in the gaps in his temples and transplant some new hair in his mid-scalp			2
' he said that many patients top up their first hair transplant with a second procedure a few years later			2
dr @entity30 said : ' many men discover they need a second procedure a few years after their first one because their hair loss continues			1
' you tend to find that if men start losing their hair at a relatively young age – say in their 20s – this hair loss tends to drop off in their mid- 40s			2
' dr @entity30 said he was thrilled to operate on another doctor			2
he said : ' all my patients get the same level of care but it is true that there is an added pressure when you are operating on another doctor , particularly one like @entity275 who is so well informed and well read			0
' i love the fact that i am the doctor 's doctor			0
being recommended by a doctor or treating a doctor is the ultimate compliment			0
