@entity0 was standing against @entity2 's @entity1 in the @entity4 and @entity5 constituency in @entity6 @entity7 today insisted the @entity8 had suffered a ' hammer blow ' after a former parliamentary candidate defected to @entity11 - only for it later to emerge that he had already been sacked from the party last week			1
@entity0 , who was standing against @entity2 's @entity1 for the @entity8 in @entity13 , claimed he was joining @entity11 after becoming ' disgusted ' at the behaviour of the ruling @entity16 group in his area			1
but the @entity8 this morning revealed they had already dropped mr @entity0 as their candidate after he revealed he was planning to stand as an independent against a @entity16 councillor			1
a spokesman for the @entity8 said : ' this man is not our candidate for @entity4 and @entity5			1
he was sacked last week			0
' we wrote to him last week to say that his position was untenable and could not stand for us at the @entity28			0
we were already selecting a new candidate for this constituency			0
this is typical @entity11 â€“ cynical , misleading and utterly calculating to try and score political points			0
' mr @entity0 , speaking on @entity33 this morning , confirmed he was sacked last week			1
he said : ' i got an email on wednesday evening to say that if i did n't stand aside from my intentions to stand in the local elections , they would remove my candidacy in @entity13 and @entity5			2
' i said i was n't prepared to do that and so as i would n't give them that guarantee they terminated my candidacy in @entity13 & @entity5			0
' mr @entity0 said he had been increasingly worried about the behaviour of the controlling group of @entity8 in @entity6 since 2011 , when seven conservative councillors from @entity48 and @entity49 resigned , citing bullying and intimidation			1
he added : ' in my opinion , the behaviour of the ruling group has only gotten worse since then			0
' mr @entity0 said he could no longer carry on ' in good conscience '			1
' his move to @entity11 just underlines that today the real party of opposition to @entity2 in the north is @entity11			0
it is another hammer blow to @entity16 pretensions in the north of @entity67 '			2
@entity68 and @entity70 mep @entity69 said : ' @entity0 has shown himself to be a man of principle in standing up for what he believes in and i am looking forward to working with him in the near future			2
' @entity7 claimed the scalp was ' another hammer blow ' for @entity77 , just a month before the general election fellow @entity11 mep @entity79 said : ' both @entity0 and his colleague @entity80 , who defected earlier this week will be standing for @entity11 in the local elections			1
' i think they will both be a great addition to the @entity11 team in this area and i am also looking forward to working with them closely			0
' @entity4 and @entity5 is safe @entity2 territory - former home secretary @entity1 is defending a 5,700 majority from the 2010 general election when the @entity90 finished third .			2
