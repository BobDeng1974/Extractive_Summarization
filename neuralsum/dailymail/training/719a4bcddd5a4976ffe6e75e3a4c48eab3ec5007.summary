campaign : @entity2 's @entity1 has opened a new headquarters in @entity4 ahead of upcoming @entity6 elections @entity1 's new @entity4 headquarters is a chaotic environment where workers are sex - obsessed and volunteers frequently leave work early to go to the pub , it was claimed today			1
former employees say that the office in @entity16 is often full of workers ' pets , while staff regularly take their clothes off and compile lists of people they would like to have sex with			1
@entity2 's wife , who works as a secretary for @entity1 , has reportedly described the office - which the party moved in to last year as part of its push to become a major political force - as a ' freakshow '			1
the revelations about the bizarre atmosphere inside the headquarters were revealed after @entity35 spoke to a number of people who have worked in the building , which is located behind @entity40 's hotel			1
the office , which was lent to @entity1 by wealthy backer @entity42 , is the centre of the party 's push to beat the mainstream parties in this year 's @entity6 elections , and to win its first mps in the general election of 2015			1
however , the insider accounts suggest that the new headquarters have failed to bring about a more professional approach , with one worker describing the atmosphere as ' @entity55 politics ' where staff are accustomed to ending work early and going to the pub instead			1
one employee said : ' they are utterly chaotic			2
i was horrified by them			0
there 's an element of the 70s golf club			2
' another added : ' you see the most extraordinary things			0
everybody has been out with everybody else			0
there are animals in the office , people taking their clothes off ... there are no sanctions			0
people are used to doing their own thing			0
' chaos : the office , located behind @entity83 's , is said to be full of animals and half - naked employees at one point , workers wrote a list of ' people we want to s * * g ' on the office whiteboard - including the name of mr @entity2 , the party leader who is @entity1 's only household name			1
his wife @entity94 reportedly has to send emails on mr @entity2 's behalf , because he does not know how to use a computer and prefers to receive faxes			1
she has admitted that the office ' takes some getting used to ' and privately described the atmosphere as a ' freakshow ' , according to @entity35			1
a number of figures from the world of business have tried and failed to inject a more professional attitude into the party over the past few years			0
chief executive @entity109 resigned last year after just eight months in charge , saying he could not change @entity1 's ' individualistic dna '			2
and millionaire backer @entity112 , who is funding the party 's election campaign this year , has set up a parallel operation to avoid giving any money directly to headquarters			1
cheery : mr @entity2 has a reputation as a likeable figure but is now trying to professionalise the party the insider reports come in the wake of a number of embarrassing incidents involving @entity1 candidates , most famously when mep @entity127 referred to foreign aid recipients as ' bongo bongo land ' and described women who fail to clean their homes properly as ' sluts '			2
it was claimed today that the party 's meps were being encouraged to pay a ' tithe ' of £ 10,000 a year to the party thanks to their ' generous expenses '			2
parliamentarians were allegedly told they had a duty to support @entity1 financially , because the party spends around £ 125,000 for each successful election			2
it was also reported that @entity1 @entity134 gather for a lavish dinner in @entity146 once a month , with staff at the restaurant @entity143 instructed to produce a special @entity150 - themed menu			0
@entity1 director of communications @entity151 said : ' i have been in post since the start of february and i have been hugely impressed with the professionalism and dedication of staff at @entity158			0
' the @entity35 clearly would prefer @entity1 to do very badly at the forthcoming local and @entity6 elections			0
but everyone at @entity161 is working flat out to ensure that the opposite occurs			0
given the positive response @entity1 is getting from the @entity166 public , we are very hopeful of achieving an excellent result			0

party moved in to office behind @entity83 's last year ahead of election push
but *ex-employees* claim the atmosphere in the headquarters is chaotic
workers apparently knock off early and go to the pub , while others regularly bring their pets to work and joke about sex
@entity2 's wife has admitted the @entity184 ' takes some getting used to '
