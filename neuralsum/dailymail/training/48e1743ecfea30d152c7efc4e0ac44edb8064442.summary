by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 06:53 est , 12 december 2012 updated : 08:48 est , 12 december 2012 @entity2 , the new @entity3 governor , said it might be necessary to abandon the inflation target to prioritise growth the @entity7 who will take over the @entity3 has suggested he will be more aggressive in trying to get the @entity10 economy moving			1
@entity2 hinted that he thought boosting growth is more important than keeping inflation under control			1
instead central banks must take more radical measures to encourage business to expand and bring down unemployment			0
the move would be welcomed by mortgage owners who would expect record low interest rates to last for a long time			1
the @entity3 currently has a target that inflation – the annual rise in prices - should be 2 per cent			0
mr @entity2 , who replaces sir @entity26 next june , used a speech to suggest central banks should instead target keeping interest rates low to reduce jobless figures			1
he said ‘ precise numerical thresholds ’ for unemployment could be used as a target instead			0
‘ if yet further stimulus were required , the policy framework itself would likely have to be changed , ’ said mr @entity2 , who is currently governor of the @entity33			2
he later stressed that he was talking about @entity7 policy , but the remarks will be seen as a sign that he will take a tougher approach when he moves to @entity41 next year			2
chancellor @entity42 hailed mr @entity2 as ' the outstanding central banker of his generation ' the @entity10 economy has been stagnant for two years , with forecasts suggesting it will shrink by 0.1 per cent this year and grow by only 0.8 per cent next year			1
after being given the job by @entity42 , mr @entity2 said he was going ‘ where the challenges are greatest ’			0
mr @entity42 hailed mr @entity2 as ' the outstanding central banker of his generation ' who would bring the ' strong leadership and external experience the @entity3 needs '			0
in a speech last night to the @entity54 in @entity55 , mr @entity2 said central banks had to take togher action during major economic slumps			0
he said : ‘ to achieve a better path for the economy over time , a central bank may need to commit credibly to maintaining highly accommodative policy even after the economy and , potentially , inflation picks up			0
‘ to “ tie its hands ” , a central bank could publicly announce precise numerical thresholds for inflation and unemployment that must be met before reducing stimulus			2
sir @entity26 will stand down as @entity3 governor next june ‘ if yet further stimulus were required , the policy framework itself would likely have to be changed			1
for example , adopting a nominal gdp level target could in many respects be more powerful than employing thresholds under flexible inflation targeting			0
” it would mark a major shift from the policy of sir @entity26 who has refused to drop the inflation target of two per cent which was set by the @entity87 government in 1997 .			1

@entity7 @entity2 suggests inflation target could be *ditched* to focus on unemployment
good news for mortgage holders as new bank governor hints at low rates for years to come
he will replace sir @entity26 in june next year
