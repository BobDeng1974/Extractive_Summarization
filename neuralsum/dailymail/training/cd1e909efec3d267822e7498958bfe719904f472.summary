by @entity0 published : 05:52 est , 22 april 2013 updated : 09:36 est , 22 april 2013 a millionaire property developer is embroiled in a planning row with his council after he was ordered to remove two £ 15,000 lion - topped gate posts from his castle			1
@entity6 , 73 , is furious after officials ruled that the 12ft high @entity9 stone pillars outside his seven - bedroom £ 1.7million property are ' out of keeping ' with the local area			1
the gateposts , which were modelled on the entrance to @entity14 , were built without planning permission just before @entity16			0
country pile : @entity6 has been ordered to pull down these £ 15,000 lion - topped pillars outside his castle because he does n't have planning permission order : mr @entity6 , 73 , received a council enforcement notice over the 12ft @entity9 stone pillars he had built just before @entity16 the builder , who moved into his 1840s property around 15 years ago , has been handed an enforcement notice and told to remove them			1
but mr @entity6 says the posts have been well - received by local residents and has vowed to fight the ' unelected officials ' who are demanding their removal			1
the property magnate , who lives in the exclusive @entity33 area of @entity34 , said : ' an @entity36 's home is supposed to be his castle			1
' well , i live in a castle but it does n't feel that way after seeing these officials come up here and tell me to take my pillars down			1
' his property is one of the most exclusive addresses in @entity34 and has around ten acres of land backing onto the stunning @entity50			1
mr @entity6 has instructed his lawyers to challenge the enforcement notice , a process he expects to cost him £ 3,000			2
he criticised @entity34 's general attitude towards planning policy , adding : ' you ca n't get anything done in this city			1
we have n't got a decent football stadium and no concert venue either			2
' a letter from the council states the new pillars are ' out of keeping ' with the listed house and have ' no substantial public benefit '			2
but mr @entity6 disputes the council 's claim and says the posts are an asset , which enhance the road			1
he said : ' they say it is out of context with the area , but it 's the area which is out of context with our house , with all the modern developments which were allowed to be built around here			2
exclusive home : mr @entity6 's seven - bedroom house built in the style of a castle			1
he modelled the pillars topped with lions on the entrance to @entity14 ornate : the stone lion which builder @entity6 put up on top of his gate posts ' i see the posts as an asset , which enhances the folly			1
i have n't met one person who does n't like them			2
' it seems that in the hands of these unelected officials who come up here it must be pulled down			0
' the builder , who grew up on a @entity34 council estate , said he was unaware his new gate posts would need planning permission			1
the businessman criticised the ' draconian ' council which , he claims , will not even allow him to apply for consent retrospectively			0
he said : ' i did n't realise we needed planning permission for the pillars			2
' i found out afterwards that anything above 3ft needed permission so i applied for retrospective planning and they would n't have it			0
' they wo n't even let me speak to a conservation officer			0
the council is so draconian , trees have more rights than people here			0
' it is not like it is a block of flats i 've just built , they are pillars at the front of a home in a quiet cul - de - sac			2
what harm will they do ? not one person has complained to me			0
' i 've lived at the home for 15 years and we 've spent thousands restoring it			0
' the councillors are a waste of time , they just rubber stamp what unelected planners say			0
the planners and politicians in @entity34 are too busy fighting each other to help the people			1
castle : the seven - bedroom home of builder @entity6 , 73 , which has been designed to look like a castle model : the @entity152 to @entity14 , featuring a pair of stone lions , which mr @entity6 built the gates outside his home to look like ' we 've now got to wait for an officer from the @entity159 to make an independent decision			1
' mr @entity6 , who still works six days a week despite being 73 , says nobody has contacted him personally other than to say they did n't like the colour			1
he added : ' the council said the pillars are out of context with the home , but the whole area is out of context with the home so that point is a load of rubbish			0
' apparently there have been five complaints but no one has told me they do n't like the gates			0
one person said they did n't like the colour			0
' some people have been talking about me like i 'm some toff			0
' my father was a prisoner of war in @entity186 and he died in 1950 because of it			0
my mother bought me up in a council house in @entity34			2
i 'm just a working class , hard working builder			0
' the council has defended the decision , claiming the authority 's planning department had received five complaints about the pillars			0
spokesman @entity197 said : ' enforcement officers met with colleagues in the @entity200 and assessed the pillars to be harmful to the setting of the listed building and this part of the @entity205			0
mr @entity6 's appeal is being dealt with by the independent @entity207			1
anger : mr @entity6 has been told he must pull down this stone construction as he did not have planning permission			2

' an @entity36 's home is supposed to be his castle . i live in a castle but it does n't feel that way , ' said the developer
@entity6 , 73 , is fighting the order to remove the posts
his listed seven - bedroom 1840s castle in @entity34 has ten acres of land
