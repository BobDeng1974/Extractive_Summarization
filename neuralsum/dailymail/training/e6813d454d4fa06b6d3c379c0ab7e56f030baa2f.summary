mr @entity8 said : ‘ @entity8 ’s music was blaring and his lights were still on so i went upstairs to tell him to go to bed			1
i just ran downstairs screaming - i could not believe it			2
’ the warehouse worker told the inquest that @entity8 was also physically attacked by his tormenters and had confronted the school about the abuse , which had been going on for over five months			1
he said : ‘ in may last year i noticed a lump on his head			2
when i confronted him about it he said a boy at school hit him			2
' on another occasion when i called @entity8 to tell him i would pick him up from school i heard children calling him names in the background			1
family : @entity8 ( right ) is photographed with his grandmother @entity53 ( left ) and uncle @entity54 ( centre ) ‘ the phone call was really bad , lots of children were calling him names and shouting swear words			1
i discussed the matter with the school and was told there was a zero tolerance policy towards bullying			2
’ tragic : @entity8 , who died last october , is pictured with his baby cousin @entity68 mr @entity8 said he was reassured the matter would be resolved but the next day @entity8 begged his father to go to school with him			1
he added : ‘ he said “ @entity74 can you come to school with me ? ” he was terrified , he was shaking , he was crying			1
i asked if everything was okay afterwards and he said it was sorted			2
‘ he was very withdrawn towards the end			0
it actually got me very upset and i would cry in front of him asking him : “ what is wrong - i know you have changed ? ” he used to be a jolly lad , he enjoyed telling jokes , he was a pleasant little boy and was well behaved			0
‘ i was really concerned , he just used to always speak to me but then he stopped talking to me , he used to shut himself in his room			0
my own conclusion was that he was being threatened not to say anything			0
’ @entity8 ’s grandmother @entity53 also believed the teenager was being bullied and said she had been in touch with some of his friends on @entity95 since his death			1
giving evidence , she said : ‘ they have said he was being bullied because he would n’t conform to what they wanted him to do			0
’ a police investigation also found @entity8 had been teased because of his ginger hair and had researched how to commit suicide on the internet			1
but detective inspector @entity105 , from @entity106 , said there was not enough evidence that he had been bullied by his peers			0
education : @entity8 was a pupil at @entity9 ( pictured ) in @entity10			1
a police investigation found the boy had been teased because of his ginger hair he said : ‘ his school friends have told us there was teasing because he had red hair			2
that was what one of his friends said - that there was teasing because he had dyed his hair			0
’ sad case : @entity8 had researched how to commit suicide on the internet , the inquest was told @entity9 headteacher @entity128 also told the hearing there was no evidence of bullying at the school			1
she said : ‘ no one had seen a change , nothing was reported to his friends other than the incident in may described			0
he was a popular young man but very much a young man , he was a joker			0
he had a wide circle of friends			0
’ recording a verdict of suicide , @entity143 coroner @entity142 said : ‘ the only positive motive that comes to light is bullying			0
however , i have to say there is no clear evidence			0
‘ the police have carried out a clear investigation and we have heard evidence from mrs @entity128			0
‘ perhaps most importantly the police have been able to read his @entity95 record and there is nothing that suggests he was being bullied			0
this is a tragedy for the family and also for @entity8 ’s friends			1
’ following the verdict , mrs @entity128 told @entity162 : ‘ over a year on the school community still feels the loss , the grief and the shock , from the tragic passing of @entity8			1
‘ @entity8 was many things to many people			2
for some he was a quiet unassuming young man , to some of his class mates he was the one they could confide in , to others he was the one with the wicked sense of humour and infectious laugh			0
‘ to his closest friends however , those with whom he shared his interests , his musical tastes and manga obsession , he was himself - their best friend and confidante			0
our thoughts are always with @entity8 ’s family and his friends - he is greatly missed			2
