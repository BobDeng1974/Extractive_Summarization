reputation and sentiment will be shoved aside in @entity2 this evening as @entity3 ’ ‘ @entity9 ’ set out to hunt down @entity4 and deny the icon a fitting farewell and claim their own @entity8 glory			1
the script surely dictates that @entity13 ’s @entity12 hero of the ages concludes his last appearance on these shores as a champion again , in a @entity19 team who retain their @entity22 title			1
but @entity3 do not intend to yield to this fairytale scenario and in fact they are hell - bent on honouring their own departing skipper in appropriate fashion			1
whether or not the former @entity13 captain actually leads his side on to the @entity47 pitch just before 5pm can not be assured until that hour arrives , but his reassuring presence would provide @entity3 with a vital boost			1
@entity51 ’s men will ensure @entity4 will have to contend with a monumental onslaught in this last instalment of the continent ’s blue - riband event , in its current guise			1
‘ we are a ferocious team with a lot of intensity in our defence , ’ said full back @entity57			2
‘ we do n’t believe in going in in ones or twos ; we hunt as a team			2
we go after the opposition and we are relentless in that pursuit of them			2
whether that means @entity4 or whoever , we keep coming and we keep coming			1
‘ we were all pretty young when he won the @entity71 with that kick			0
from then on he ’s been a hero to a lot of @entity75 people , but as far as we ’re concerned , we want to put as much pressure as possible on him			0
’ top dog : @entity4 scored all of @entity19 's points in last season 's 24 - 12 semi-final victory at @entity82 that is the mindset which underpins the @entity9 — a term coined by @entity3 ’ defence coach , @entity85 , to signify the team ’s commitment to hunting in numbers , without let - up			1
@entity27 added : ‘ @entity90 is what we call our defence			0
it ’s called the @entity9 because wolves hunt better in packs			0
it is something we have talked about for a long time			0
the strength of the wolf is in the pack			0
that ’s how we operate			0
’ under the closed roof , @entity3 will go big - game , big - name hunting , driven on by the ferocity of their @entity106 flanker , @entity105 , whose thunderous tackling and breakdown work inspired the semi-final rout of @entity110			1
he and his team - mates will have to reach such stupendous heights again if they are to deny a @entity19 line - up laden with international glitterati			1
the @entity116 club are favourites — 4 - 6 with @entity117 , while @entity3 are the 6 - 5 outsiders			1
so much attention will focus on the @entity4 v @entity27 contest at @entity12 ; a repeat of last year ’s semi-final head to head which was comfortably won by the veteran and his team			1
winning smile : @entity4 ( centre ) is looking for successive @entity22 successes with @entity19 eyes on the prize : @entity27 is looking to win his first @entity22 in saturday 's final against @entity19 pass master : @entity13 international @entity27 will face @entity71 winner @entity4 in a fly - half battle that game yielded the memorable image of @entity4 consoling his young rival after landing a quick - reaction drop goal			1
recalling the incident , @entity27 said : ‘ we put pressure on him for his drop goal and he managed to get it over			0
i think my words were “ there ’s no way you got that over ” because i had n’t seen it — i could n’t see the posts			0
he said , “ sorry ”			0
that was it ! ’ @entity4 also relived the moment when he patted @entity27 on the head , adding : ‘ it was a gesture of respect and i think he understood that perfectly			2
‘ i knew chance would play a big part in that drop goal and the gesture was to show my respect , like in tennis when a shot hits the net and drops over the other side			2
i just wanted to say sorry because that ’s what i felt			0
’ @entity19 have come to @entity168 armed with a multitude of weapons , from @entity171 to @entity172 , @entity173 in the scrum , fearsome locks in @entity176 and @entity177 , the magnificent @entity179 captain @entity178 and exiled @entity13 flanker @entity180			2
captain fantastic : @entity40 has been named in @entity3 team for their @entity22 final vs @entity19 scare : @entity40 ( centre ) injured himself during @entity3 ' @entity38 semi-final win vs @entity186 sitting pretty : @entity3 full - back @entity57 looks on during practice at the @entity47 in @entity2 but @entity4 is the ringmaster and talisman , as his coach , @entity191 , made clear when he said : ‘ after we ( @entity193 ) lost against @entity13 at @entity82 a few years , i said , “ we have @entity195 and they have @entity4 ”			1
we are happy to have him			0
’ the fabled fly - half may have played in two @entity71 finals and on two @entity200 tours , but in keeping with his emphasis on the here and now , he said : ‘ just as with every other game , this game is the biggest game of my career			2
as far as i am concerned , next week ( @entity193 @entity207 league final ) does n’t exist at the moment and neither does what ’s gone before			0
‘ the thought of leaving this final without a happy ending is a painful one , so we have to make sure that it does n’t end like that			0
’ if @entity3 have their way , that is exactly how it will end — with the @entity219 leg of @entity4 ’s farewell party well and truly spoiled			1
that ’s the vision , but despite their heroics against @entity110 it is still difficult to envisage			0
@entity19 have sufficient power and class to give their idol his dream send - off .			2

@entity4 to play in his last game in @entity219 before *retiring*
@entity40 will start for @entity3 after recovering from injury
@entity19 are the current defending @entity22 champions
