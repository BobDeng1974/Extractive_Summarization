@entity1 has been surprised by the @entity13 ’ muted criticism of its plans , announced last week , to use tax reforms to fund a proposed cut in tuition fees from £ 9,000 to £ 6,000 a year			1
shadow cabinet ministers suspect chancellor @entity20 ( pictured ) will seek to make a ‘ game - changing ’ tax announcement later this month that could be funded by scaling back tax relief to pensioners the party said it would cut the amount people can pay into a pension and get tax relief on over their lifetime from £ 1.25million to £ 1million , and reduce the amount that can be paid in to a pension with tax relief each year from £ 40,000 to £ 30,000			1
mr @entity2 has already reduced the lifetime allowance , which used to be £ 1.5million , arguing that it unfairly benefited the most wealthy			1
a @entity1 source said a cut to £ 1million would fund a significant reduction in the threshold for employees ’ national insurance contributions			2
workers currently pay @entity4 on earnings above £ 153 a week , or £ 7,956 a year , at a rate of 12 per cent , but it kicks in at a far lower level than the income tax threshold , which will increase to £ 10,600 in april			1
cutting @entity4 would ensure that 1.2million workers who earn too little to gain from the increase in the personal allowance – many of them women with part - time jobs – would benefit			2
@entity13 sources insisted senior members of the @entity51 had not yet met to agree measures ahead of the budget on march 18			0
the chancellor yesterday hailed a report from economists saying living standards in @entity58 will finally return to pre-recession levels			0
mr @entity2 said the verdict from the respected @entity62 had ‘ put to bed ’ several @entity1 myths , saying incomes had been restored to pre-crisis levels , the wealthiest have paid the most towards deficit reduction and inequality in society has been reduced			1
@entity69 ( pictured ) @entity1 ’s shadow financial secretary to the treasury , said : ‘ we need a recovery that reaches kitchen tables across @entity58 , not one which has left working people worse off ' he said the findings showed @entity58 had ‘ reached a major milestone in the recovery , but it ’s not the end of the journey ’			0
‘ we ’ve got to secure a national recovery and must n’t abandon the progress we have made at risk by abandoning the plan that has got us this far , ’ he told @entity80			0
he said families had ‘ paid a very heavy price for the mistakes that led to the great recession ’ under @entity1			0
‘ but the picture you hear , particularly from my political opponents , of the @entity58 economy is not one reflected in this independent report - indeed quite the opposite			2
‘ what they show is that @entity58 is growing , that incomes are rising , that the richest have made the biggest contribution , inequality has fallen ... @entity58 is fundamentally in a better position than it was five years ago			0
‘ if you look at the rate of progress in the report today , if you look at incomes , they should be higher in 2015/16 than they were in 2010/11 , so on that measure as well we will have made progress			0
