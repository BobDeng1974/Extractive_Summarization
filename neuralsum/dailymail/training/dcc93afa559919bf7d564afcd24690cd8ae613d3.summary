by @entity0 published : 13:22 est , 7 january 2014 updated : 14:03 est , 7 january 2014 a police officer , her lover and his wife stole thousands of road crash victims ' details from her force computer and sold them to injury lawyers in a conspiracy that could have been worth £ 1million , a court heard			1
former constable @entity12 , 27 , allegedly downloaded the personal files of people involved in accidents before pressurising them into claiming compensation so she could claim £ 800 referral fees from solicitors			1
@entity21 was having an affair with co-accused @entity23 , also 27 , for eight months of the 11 - month scheme - but ended it when they were arrested after an anonymous tip - off , prosecutors claim			1
accused : @entity12 , 27 , ( left ) allegedly downloaded unique reference numbers from @entity28 computers			1
@entity23 , 27 , and his wife @entity29 , 26 , are also accused of conspiring to get up to £ 1million in solicitor referral fees			1
the jury at @entity32 heard the lovers , with @entity23 's wife , @entity29 , 26 , set up three companies in april 2011 before selling a total of 2,456 unique reference numbers for £ 26,400 to various firms			1
@entity39 , prosecuting , said : ' if all of the data stolen had been converted into referral fees , if they had kept going , the value of those referral fees would have been worth over £ 1 million			0
' every day , tens of thousands of police officers go out there and perform their duties sometimes at not inconsiderable risk to themselves , and they do so as we would expect them to , with duty , responsibility and integrity			0
' integrity , honesty and duty are really what this case is all about			0
one of these defendants , @entity12 , was a serving police officer with @entity28			1
denial : @entity23 and @entity29 , here leaving @entity32 , claim they did not know the illegal source of the information ' @entity70 's case against her is that she does n't have integrity , she did n't fulfil her duties to us , the public , in the way she ought and she abused her position and she abused it with the assistance of the other two defendants in the dock			1
' all three of them have been involved in a conspiracy to obtain confidential police information			0
' he continued : ' she had accessed , i am going to suggest , a staggering 2,456 @entity85 , different incidents , on the computer and almost all of them had no connection with her duties , no connection with her responsibilities as an investigating officer			0
' @entity70 says she was abusing that system and stealing 2,500 people 's details from that computer system			2
she had on almost every case no valid reason for doing so whatsoever			0
' we say it was nothing short of a deliberate and cynical abuse of the privilege she had been given by having access to that system in the first place			0
' all three defendants deny the charges			0
mr @entity39 said that on march 2011 , @entity23 registered a company called @entity111 and the following month @entity21 began to steal the police data			2
and @entity21 told police that the @entity114 and the @entity115 in the company referred to the initials of her first name and @entity23 's , he added			1
mr @entity39 said that the group went on to set up a second company in may 2011 , registered under @entity29 's name , to handle the growing number of cases			1
he said a third company was then set up , again under @entity29 , who claims ignorance of the illegal source of the data			2
the jury heard @entity21 claims @entity23 threatened and blackmailed her to steal the data , while @entity23 insists he did not know the source was illegal			2
mr @entity39 said : ' that defence is an absolute nonsense and does n't stand up to any scrutiny			0
' it is more than a coincidence that these two people , who are lovers , set up a company with the initials of their first two names			0
' they became lovers and it seems that relationship has continued on for most of time we are dealing with in this case			0
the jury heard @entity21 , here leaving court with her solicitor , set up three companies with her co-accused to pressurise victims into claiming compensation ' @entity70 says this conspiracy was planned out in advance , particularly by mr @entity23 and @entity21			1
' @entity21 appears to suggest to police in her interview that her involvement in taking this data illegally was that she had been forced to by mr @entity23			2
' she says that in fact she was being blackmailed and threatened and he threatened to disclose things to her family and employer			0
' he said @entity23 sent her an email which included the lines ' i will never stop loving you ' and ' thanks for the great sex ' and ' at least you blew out my candle on my birthday '			0
he explained that of the 500 calls from @entity21 's mobile phone to @entity23 during the period of the conspiracy , many were just before and after she accessed information on the police computer			1
the prosecutor added that @entity21 would also contact the accident victims and use ' pressure sales ' techniques			2
he also said that £ 1,600 in cash was found by police at @entity23 's house			1
the trial , which is expected to last a month , continues .			0
