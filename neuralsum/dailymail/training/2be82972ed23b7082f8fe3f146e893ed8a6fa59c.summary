by @entity0 published : 11:09 est , 16 november 2012 updated : 11:10 est , 16 november 2012 a slavery - era law that allows for prisoners in @entity3 to be whipped with a cat o ' nine tails is to be abolished on the island			1
the @entity9 country 's justice ministry has said the ' degrading ' corporal punishment will be removed from the penal code			1
the punishment allows for prisoners to be whipped with a cat o ' nine tails - which consists of nine knotted cords - or a rod made from the branches of a tamarind tree			1
' degrading ' : the news that the flogging of prisoners with a cat o ' nine tails ( pictured ) is to be banned in @entity3 has been welcomed by human rights activists courts in the former @entity26 colony stopped ordering the punishment in 2004 , but ministers want to see the law abolished entirely			1
@entity3 's justice minister @entity30 said flogging was a ' degrading ' anachronism that violates the country 's international obligations and is preventing the government from ratifying the @entity37 convention against torture			1
' anachronism ' : @entity3 's justice minister @entity30 said it was time to get the law ' off our books once and for all ' ' the time has come to regularise this situation by getting these colonial - era laws off our books once and for all , ' mr @entity30 said in a statement			1
the move to repeal the whipping law has already been approved by the cabinet in @entity3 , where plantation slavery was particularly brutal			2
the announcement was welcomed by human rights activists who view flogging as a barbaric throwback in a nation populated mostly by the descendants of slaves			0
@entity60 , chairwoman of @entity61 , said : ' we do n't really see that [ the flogging law ] has any part in the approach of dealing with crime in a modern democracy			0
' but there are no shortage of crime - weary @entity3 who feel that authorities should not drop the old statutes but instead enforce them , arguing that thieves who steal livestock or violent criminals who harm innocent people should receive a whipping to teach them a lesson			0
' the worst criminals need strong punishing or else they 'll do crimes over and over , ' said @entity81 , a father of three from @entity82			0
' getting locked up is not always enough			0
' the last person to suffer the punishment in @entity3 was @entity85 , who was sentenced to four years in prison and six lashes in 1994 for stabbing his mother - in - law			2
@entity85 was flogged the day before being released from prison in 1997 and later complained to the @entity37 @entity90 , which ruled in 2004 that the form of corporal punishment was cruel , inhuman and degrading and violated his rights			2
@entity3 courts then stopped ordering flogging .			0
