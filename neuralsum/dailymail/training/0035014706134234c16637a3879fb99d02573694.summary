by @entity0 published : 07:35 est , 4 october 2012 updated : 01:59 est , 5 october 2012 he is well known for his memorable comments and knack of saying the wrong thing			2
so perhaps it is only fitting that the @entity6 now has one of his own phrases immortalised in the @entity10			1
the latest edition is expected to say that prince @entity6 introduced the term ' blue - arsed fly ' , after he was recorded publicly scolding a photographer in 1970			1
the colourful expression will now be attributed to him , unless anyone else can provide evidence that another person used the phrase in public			1
the @entity6 will make it into the @entity10 's pages for his choice of language the @entity6 was apparently annoyed by a group of reporters and tourists and questioned a photographer who was taking pictures of him whether he was getting enough shots			1
when the photographer said that he hoped so the @entity6 snapped : ' you should do			1
you have been running around like a blue - arsed fly			2
' the @entity36 reported the phrase - which describes someone in a constant flurry of activity - on april 22 , 1970 , and since then it has become a common phrase			1
the @entity10 's search for earlier uses of the word comes as part of their public online appeal to help trace the origins of words			2
launched yesterday , the compendium 's editors need help in unearthing new information about the history and usage of @entity55 , including the earliest examples of particular words			1
they suspect that the phrased attributed to prince @entity6 has earlier roots			1
they said : ' the r-less blue - assed fly , however , is attested from at least 1932			2
why such a discrepancy ? ' since our original @entity10 entry was published in 2005 , we ’ve discovered an earlier example of blue - arsed fly in a dictionary of slang from 1949 , but we suspect there may be evidence out there that is earlier still			0
' prince @entity6 is credited with the phrase after becoming annoyed they are also seeking help from anyone who knows the origin of ' in your dreams ' , ' @entity77 ' and ' come in from the cold			1
' in their appeal , chief editor of the @entity10 , @entity81 , explains how the @entity84 initiative will help the team to revise the @entity10 : ' when researching and revising entries , our team of editors use the @entity10 ’s famous citation files , gathered over more than a century , as well as the latest digitized databases and @entity93 evidence			2
' nonetheless , the very first recorded usage of many words can be difficult to track down			0
' we can trace certain words and phrases back only so far with conventional tools			2
' an old takeaway menu , a family letter or album , or an obscure journal might hold the key to solving one of those mysteries			0
” @entity10 editor @entity106 also said : ' the @entity10 ’s record of the history of @entity55 was relying on input from the public more than a century before the term ‘ crowdsourcing ’ was even coined			0
' @entity113 launched an appeal to the public as far back as 1879 , and the @entity84 continues this long tradition of asking the public for help in our quest to record the origins of our vast , fantastic , ever - changing lexicon			0
' after all , when it comes to the words we read , write , speak , and hear each day , every one of us is an expert			0
' prince @entity6 admits that he has a unique way of expressing himself			1
he described as ' @entity128			0
the science of opening your mouth and putting your foot in it , a science which i have practised for a good many years			0
' what 's he said this time ? the @entity6 is known for using colourful expressions , which he has used when on tour with the @entity141 on his daughter , @entity142 , he said : ‘ if it does n’t fart or eat hay , she is n’t interested			1
’ in 2001 , he made his feelings clear about @entity149 's choice of vehicle			0
he said the singer after hearing that he had sold his @entity157 - themed @entity156 : ‘ oh , it ’s you that owns that ghastly car , is it ? we often see it when driving to @entity154			0
’ on being offered fine @entity161 wines by prime minister @entity162 at a dinner in @entity164 in 2000 , he said : ‘ get me a beer			0
i do n’t care what kind it is , just get me a beer ! ’			0
