by @entity0 published : 06:25 est , 12 march 2013 updated : 06:58 est , 12 march 2013 these breathtaking pictures show the @entity2 and the moon eclipsing the @entity4 as seen from the @entity6 spacecraft which studies the star at the centre of our solar system			2
@entity6 ’s @entity11 ( @entity11 ) captured the awe inspiring pictures as it observed transits by both our planet and its natural satellite on sunday night to monday morning			0
the @entity11 entered its biannual eclipse season at the beginning of march , a period of three weeks when @entity2 blocks its view of the sun for a period of time each day			1
breathtaking : in this image taken by @entity6 's @entity11 the view of the @entity4 is blocked by the @entity2			1
the boundaries of @entity2 's shadow appear fuzzy , since @entity11 can see some light through the atmosphere @entity2 blocked @entity11 ’s view of the sun from about 10.15pm to 11.45pm gmt on sunday night			2
later , from around 3.30am to 4.45am monday morning , the moon moved in front of the sun for a partial eclipse			0
when @entity2 blocks the sun , the boundaries of @entity2 ’s shadow appear fuzzy , since @entity11 can see some light from the sun coming through @entity2 ’s atmosphere			2
the line of @entity2 appears almost straight , since @entity2 - from @entity11 ’s point of view - is so large compared to the sun. the eclipse caused by the @entity41 , by contrast looks very different			0
@entity43 - inspiring : this image , taken just a few hours later , shows the view as the moon moves in front of the @entity11 's view of the @entity4 since the moon has no atmosphere , and the line of its shadow is crisp and clean since the moon has no atmosphere , its curved shape can be seen clearly , and the line of its shadow is crisp and clean			1
any spacecraft observing the @entity4 from an orbit around @entity2 has to contend with such eclipses , but @entity11 's orbit is designed to minimize them as much as possible , with only two three - week eclipse seasons each year			1
the 2013 spring eclipse season continues until march 26			0
the autumn season will begin on september 2 .			0

the @entity11 is in the midst of its biannual eclipse season when its orbit puts the @entity2 between it and the @entity4
the first image shows the @entity2 transiting the @entity4 , with a fuzzy **outline** caused by light *shining* through the atmosphere
the moon 's transit appears much clearer , since the natural satellite has no atmosphere to break up its **outline**
