a compliment is supposed to make the receiver feel better about themselves , but bashful @entity4 women say that they are either ' in denial ' , embarrassed or uncomfortable when something beautiful is pointed out about them			1
new research by skincare brand dove has found that some women find it so difficult to talk about their bodies in a positive way that they would rather fall over in the middle of a public place than tell people a part of their body they think is beautiful			0
in their latest campaign for real beauty the brand has partnered with award - winning photographer @entity20 to capture real women celebrating a part of themselves that their friends have helped them identify as beautiful			2
@entity26 is aiming to capitalise on the ability of women to help their friends see their own personal beauty in its beauty spot campaign which launches today			1
when asked what part of themselves they would call beautiful , the range of answers shows just how unpredictable women can be with responses including calves , toes , shoulders , wrists and even ribcages ! sadly 7 per cent of women said they could n’t name a single thing			1
over half of women make sure they tell their friends what 's beautiful about them on a regular basis yet while only 1 per cent of @entity4 women would call themselves beautiful , they find it easy to see beauty in their friends			1
on average , it takes women less than half a second to name something beautiful about their friends , compared to up to eight seconds to name something beautiful about themselves			1
over half of women ( 52 per cent ) make sure they tell their friends what ’s beautiful about them on a regular basis , with two thirds ( 66 per cent ) saying they do so because they know the positive impact this can have on how they feel about their bodies			2
commenting on the images , photographer @entity20 said : ‘ the idea of the image is to represent the power we all have to feel more confident about who we are			0
by supporting one another we can change our own views to more rational , realistic , and positive ones			0
it takes women less than half a second to name something beautiful about their friends , compared to up to eight seconds to name something beautiful about themselves @entity4 women report feeling in denial , embarrassed and uncomfortable when someone points out something beautiful about them 1			1
feet just 1 % of women describe themselves as beautiful 31 % of women describe themselves as average 23 % describe themselves as ‘ natural ’ 12 % describe themselves as attractive ' i hope that when people see the campaign they will be encouraged to re-evaluate how they define beauty and compliment a friend on how great her bum looks rather than her new jeans			1
' @entity119 , 32 from @entity120 , who chose her bottom as her beauty spot , says : ' at first it was hard to think about a part of my body i was happy with , but with people encouraging me to look at the parts of my body i am happy with , i realised my bum was my beauty spot			2
' 25 year old @entity131 from @entity132 chose her arms as her beauty spot and says : ' they are toned without being overly muscly and the skin is soft			2
i had n't said or thought about my body in a positive way in a long time			0
it was great to have a conversation about our bodies that was n't just what we hated about them			0
' commenting on the research , @entity143 , a director of the @entity145 , says : ' this @entity26 study reveals some of the anxieties experienced by women talking about their own appearance , perhaps especially in this country , where our ' modesty rules ' complicate matters by prescribing self - deprecation			0
' but for me the most important findings are those showing how readily and effortlessly female friends praise each other 's appearance , and the power of such compliments to reassure us and lift our spirits			0
' in the last campaign two portraits were drawn by an @entity167 sketch artist from descriptions by the woman herself and a stranger , were often dramatically different and reveal women tend to underestimate their looks many of the women seem stunned when they saw the stark contrast between the two drawings side - by - side			0
