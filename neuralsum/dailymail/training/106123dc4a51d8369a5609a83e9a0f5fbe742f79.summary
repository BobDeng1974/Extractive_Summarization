she said : ' first and foremost i would wish to thank with all my heart all of those people who have supported me and have not given up on me and never doubted my innocence during this living nightmare			1
' if it was not for the unerring love and support of my family , my mum @entity33 , dad @entity34 and brother @entity35 , my fiance @entity31 , and all my friends , i do not know how i would have coped			1
' i would also like to thank the members of the public who have also supported me and have believed in my innocence			1
' i have been living in hell and was locked up in prison for something i had not done			2
' nonetheless , i would like to take the opportunity to thank the staff at @entity47 for their love and support			2
' it was so frustrating for me knowing that the person who has actually carried out these terrible acts is still out there			2

the only theme among her @entity86 wall updates which revealed this fun - loving character was the many messages referring to her feeling tired from work and long night shifts at the hospital			0
miss @entity2 had been charged with contaminating the saline drips and also with theft of medical supplies			0
the contamination charges have now been dropped because of lack of sufficient evidence and the theft charge was dropped because it was not in the public interest to continue			0

yesterday the chief crown prosecutor for the @entity129 , @entity130 , said it was ‘ no longer appropriate ’ to continue the case against @entity133			1
he said : ‘ she was charged on the basis that there was a reasonable suspicion that she had committed the offences and there were reasonable grounds for believing the investigation would provide further evidence within a reasonable period of time			0
‘ the inquiries have not provided us with a stronger case which would meet the test of a realistic prospect of conviction			1
‘ there is the prospect that further evidence may emerge which we would consider			0
the law does allow us to reinstate charges in those circumstances , particularly where the allegations are serious			0

’ officers have interviewed 200 out of 700 people they want to speak to			0
their list includes hospital staff , patients and visitors			0
he added : ‘ all these people who came into the contact of the hospital were particularly poorly people so we have to understand the impact of contamination , although we are clear there was contamination in a number of saline products			1
