' no other pharmacist in @entity19 or @entity44 had what he needed so we had to go back to the surgery to get it changed			0
' he later added : ' unfortunately @entity15 was admitted to hospital this morning			0
' who knows , if he ’d have had the steroid tablets when he needed them it could have been avoided			0
