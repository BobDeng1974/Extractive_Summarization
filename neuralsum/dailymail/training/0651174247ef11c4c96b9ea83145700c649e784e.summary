by @entity0 published : 04:33 est , 6 august 2012 updated : 10:28 est , 7 august 2012 when they found out they were working on the starting line of the 100 metre final , these volunteers wo n't have believed their luck - and boy did they show it when @entity7 came on to the track in @entity9			1
the volunteers were clearly trying to obey their instructions to be unassuming and stand in position waiting for their athlete 's beckon call , but they struggled to contain themselves when presented by the impossibly cool @entity15 and the other sprint stars			2
such was the magnitude of the event , and the grandiosity of the athletes before them , the volunteers can be seen catching each other 's eyes to share their excitement that they are within feet of the fastest man who has ever lived as he readies himself to defend his @entity28 crown			1
all eyes on @entity15 : a female volunteer ( right ) on the starting looked on in awe at @entity15 as he warmed up just one look : the volunteer appears to give bolt a quick up and down still looking : @entity15 hands his stash to a volunteer as he is eagerly watched by another one @entity39 's off , @entity15 : a young volunteer ( left ) looks delighted to receive @entity15 's hat before sharing a joke with the world record holder @entity15 , meanwhile , is going through his usual pre-race schtick			1
a lot of bravado and bouncing around is interspersed with diligent warm - ups and drills as the young volunteers , and two billion others worldwide , look on awe - struck			0
but who can blame them ? the @entity55 volunteers had the best view in the house ahead of @entity15 smashing his own @entity28 record last night			1
the female volunteers can be seen staring at the sprinters , in particular @entity61 , and then - stopping just short of giggling - look at one another , eyebrows aloft , to share their blatant joy			0
at one point , when @entity15 takes off his training jumper , one of the young women looks at him and struggles to force the smile from her face			0
@entity15 's personal volunteer - a young man who is beaming from ear to ear from the moment the @entity73 arrives on track - is lucky enough to receive the @entity73 's hat just seconds before he embarks on winning the gold			2
second best : @entity77 does n't quite get the same attention as his compatriot ca n't believe your luck ? the volunteers looked to be giddy at the thought they were just inches away from the fastest man ever shake it off : @entity15 's warm - up was a mix of bouncing around the track and sprint drills @entity15 leans in as he hands it to the volunteer and points as if cajoling him or making a joke before moves into position to race			2
9.63secs later , @entity15 had won the gold and beaten his own @entity28 record			1
the other sprinters , no slouches themselves , also seemed to have a hold on the young volunteers			0
@entity77 , who finished up in silver to his compatriot , was also subject to star - stricken stares , as another of the volunteers looks on with an eagerness as he sets up his starting blocks			0
even though the volunteers ' primary purpose on track was simply to take the athletes ' tracksuits , hats and @entity117 , this bunch seemed to be enjoying every minute of it			0
understandable when put into a wider context , as each and every one will have quite the yarn to spin when asked : ' where were you when @entity15 won gold at @entity126 ? ' not just @entity15 ! @entity15 's compatriot and silver medallist , @entity77 , was watched carefully as he organised himself ahead of the final it was n't just the final ... two volunteers are similarly entranced by @entity15 before he ran in the semi-final heat good view ? three volunteers try to contain their excitement , and stop just short of giggling as @entity15 warms up in front of them head and shoulders above : @entity15 cruised to victory over his rivals in the final with a time of 9.63secs , a new @entity28 record			1

games volunteers look excited as @entity7 arrive on track ahead of men 's 100m final
world record holder jokes with one as he hands him his hat
then goes on to smash @entity28 record with time of 9.63secs
