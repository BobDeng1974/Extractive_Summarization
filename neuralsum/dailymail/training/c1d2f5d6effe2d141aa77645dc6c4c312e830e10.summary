@entity13 : nearly 100 female @entity1 soldiers have been sent home from @entity3 after finding out they were pregnant			1
in september 2012 @entity14 @entity15 ( pictured ) gave birth to a son in @entity18 little trooper : @entity21 's son @entity20 with his grandmother sugar the women were flown back on flights usually reserved for injured troops , meaning the true figure could be higher if other female soldiers came home via routine flights , according to @entity30 troops are repeatedly reminded by senior officers to check they are not pregnant before they fly to the front line , however , servicewomen are not forced to take a urine test before deploying because top brass consider it would be an ‘ invasion of privacy ’			1
in september 2012 it was revealed that @entity14 @entity15 , then 28 , gave birth to a son at the field hospital in @entity18 , four days after the base was attacked by the @entity41			1
front line : servicemen and women at @entity18 stand at ease before their @entity47 parade the @entity49 - born junior non-commissioned officer in the @entity50 had a healthy boy five weeks prematurely , not knowing she was pregnant			1
she shocked military chiefs when she became the first @entity1 soldier to have a baby on the battlefield , naming the child @entity56			2
speaking after the birth , @entity21 's mother @entity57 said her daughter met the baby ’s father in the @entity1 after joining the @entity63			2
women now make up ten per cent of @entity66 personnel			2
they account for 14 per cent of the @entity67 , nine per cent of the @entity68 and eight per cent of the @entity63			0
there are currently 8,340 women serving in the @entity63 , 3010 in the @entity68 and 4,950 in the @entity67			1
in 1949 , women were officially recognised as a permanent part of @entity1 armed forces , but it was not until the @entity75 that women were first deployed in combat roles			2
women first became eligible to pilot @entity67 combat aircraft in 1989 and the following year , they were permitted to serve on @entity68 warships			2
although they can serve on the front line , women are not permitted to perform roles where the ' primary duty is to close with and kill the enemy ' , meaning they can not join the @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92			0
during deployment women serve as combat medics or engagement officers			0
after the birth she and @entity20 , who weighed a healthy 5lb 8oz , were flown to the @entity1 and treated at the @entity99 in @entity100			0
and in february 2011 it was revealed how how private @entity102 , then 21 , served on the front line in @entity3 ’s @entity104 while seven months pregnant			1
she had conceived before going to the war zone			1
@entity106 , from @entity107 , @entity108 , who serves with 12 @entity109 , put the changes to her body and weight gain down to high - calorie army rations and the stress of war			1
she only realised she was expecting two weeks after she returned home and gave birth to son @entity118			1
the figures were revealed following a request under the @entity121			0
' pregnant women are not allowed to be deployed on operations , ' an @entity10 spokesman told @entity125			0
' the small numbers of personnel who discover that they are pregnant on operations are returned at the first convenient opportunity			0
' the @entity10 does not encourage or condone sexual relationships in theatre ; our personnel are expected to behave in accordance with the @entity66 values and standards at all times			0
' the women all discovered they were pregnant while in @entity3 , although it is not known if any of the babies were conceived there			1
servicemen and women are warned that the @entity10 does not approve of sexual relations between troops and that any inappropriate behaviour would breach standards guidelines			0
those caught having sex usually face a rebuke from their commanding officer or more serious disciplinary action , depending on the rank and position of those involved			0
restricted : although they can serve on the front line , women are not permitted to perform roles where the ' primary duty is to close with and kill the enemy ' servicemen and women get three weeks off before they deploy to @entity3 and two weeks rest and recuperation during their tour of duty			1
deployments to @entity3 usually last between six and seven months , although with combat operations set to end later this year some tours have been extended to nine months			1
at least 102 servicewomen were sent home from @entity168 after finding out they were pregnant , before @entity1 forces withdrew from the country in 2009			2
soldiers heading for @entity3 undergo stringent medical checks to make sure they can cope with the rigours of combat – but not pregnancy tests			1
servicemen and women take part in pre-deployment training for about six months before they fly to the war zone			1
it includes arduous physical tests , such as an eight - mile march carrying a 40lb backpack , press - ups , sit - ups and a 1.5 - mile run against the clock			0
then there are a number of routine medical examinations depending on their roles , including hearing , eyesight and dental checks , and tests of body mass index			0
they also have blood pressure , heart rate and lung capacity monitored and recorded			0
‘ we need to know people are fit enough to leg it to a helicopter , for instance , if there is an attack , ’ said a @entity10 spokesman			0
personnel are also given any vaccinations they need to ward off tropical diseases and a course of anti-malaria tablets			0
female soldiers are asked whether they are – or suspect they are – pregnant			0
this is routine so medical staff can ensure the inoculation does not damage an unborn baby			0
if they answer ‘ yes ’ , then they will not be allowed to deploy			0
but if the response is ‘ no ’ , it serves to remind sexually active servicewomen that it might be wise to take a pregnancy test			2
pre-deployment guidelines and advice issued to every soldier make clear that women troops should not deploy if they are pregnant but at no time are women given a pregnancy test by the @entity10			2

between january 2006 and december 2013 99 servicewomen sent home
military rules ban mothers - to - be from serving in a war zone
16 women were removed from @entity3 in 2013 due to pregnancy
in september 2012 @entity15 gave birth at @entity18
