across the @entity2 region 700 years ago , the last of the @entity0 disappeared , ultimately being replaced by ancestors of the modern - day @entity5 and @entity0 cultures			1
exactly what happened to this group of people , known as the @entity11 culture , has remained a mystery			2
but now extensive research suggests this remaining group may have been wiped out due to a combination of inbreeding and climate change , ultimately perishing in isolation while the other groups lived on			2
research led by the @entity21 provides new theories as to how the first inhabitants of the @entity2 disappeared 700 years ago , which coincided with descendants of modern - day @entity5 and @entity0 arriving ( stock image shown )			1
their extinction is shrouded in mystery , as they vanished in mere decades the research , headed by the @entity31 at the @entity32 of @entity33 , @entity21 , was published in the journal @entity35			1
the @entity36 @entity2 was one of the last major regions to be settled by modern humans			0
this happened when people crossed the @entity42 from @entity43 and wandered into a new world			0
while the area has long been well researched by archaeologists , little is known of its genetic prehistory			0
in this study , researchers showed that the @entity0 , who lived in the @entity2 from about 5,000 years ago until about 700 years ago , represented a distinct wave of migration , separate from both @entity53 - who crossed the @entity42 much earlier - and the @entity5 , who came from @entity43 to the @entity2 several thousand years after the @entity0			1
the genetic studies show that the @entity0 - representing one single group - were the first people in the @entity2 , and they survived without outside contact for over 4,000 years			1
but , after surviving in near - isolation in the harsh @entity2 environment for more than 4,000 years , they disappeared around 700 years ago - about the same time when the ancestors of modern - day @entity5 spread eastward from @entity64			1
the genetic study , which involved more than 150 human remains , claims that @entity0 were the first people in the @entity2 - and they survived without outside contact for more than 4,000 years			1
however the arrival of the ancestors of modern - day @entity5 , around 1500 ad , is said to have forced the @entity0 into a mass - migration that ultimately led to their demise in just a matter of decades in the research they obtained 26 genome - wide sequences and 169 mitochondrial dna sequences from ancient human bone , teeth , and hair samples from @entity43 , @entity64 , @entity81 and @entity82			1
they also examined genomes of two present - day @entity85 , two @entity86 , one @entity87 , and two @entity88			0
twenty - seven ancient samples were then radiocarbon dated for accurate cultural assignment			0
the research rejects previous theories that @entity0 were descendants of native americans			1
the conclusion is that their disappearance was not due to them being assimilated into other cultures like the @entity101 people , who arrived at the @entity2 later			2
in the research they obtained 26 genome - wide sequences and 169 mitochondrial dna sequences from ancient human bone , teeth , and hair samples from @entity43 , @entity64 , @entity81 and @entity82			0

according to @entity116 of the @entity117 , one of the reasons for their disappearance could have been inbreeding			0
' certainly they survived for almost 5,000 years , so they were n't completely destroyed by inbreeding , ' dr @entity120 , who led the study , told the @entity117			2
' but it causes a number of medical problems , and i would n't be surprised if that had an effect on them			1
' and dr @entity132 , a professor of anthropology at @entity134 , added that the harsh tundra life coupled with the effects of climate change , namely dwindling food sources as the temperature shifted , would have contributed to their extinction			2
' when you 're dealing with sea ice , just a few degrees can be transformative , ' dr. @entity132 said			0
' three bad winters in a row where you ca n't hunt seals , and you 're in trouble			0
' the extinction of @entity0 in mere decades is a mystery			1
it 's thought they may have been driven out by technologically superior people			1
their food sources may also have dwindled as temperatures changed due to climate change			1
pictured is a researcher looking for ancient human remains in northern @entity82 however there is still more research to be done into their disappearance			0
the study was unable to establish why the extinction of the @entity0 coincided with the ancestors of the @entity5 beginning to colonise the @entity2			2
it ’s widely believed that the @entity5 ancestors - who crossed the @entity42 about 1,000 years ago and reached @entity82 around 700 years ago - were technologically superior to the @entity0 , which may have led to them being driven out			1
the @entity5 's own myths tell stories of a people before them , which likely refer to the @entity0			2
in the myths , they are referred to as the ' @entity11 ' or ' @entity175 ' , which means ‘ the first inhabitants ’			0
according to these myths they were giants , who were taller and stronger than the @entity5 , but easily frightened from their settlements by the newcomers			0
genetic studies show that the @entity0 were the first people in the @entity2 , and they survived without outside contact for over 4,000 years			1
but , after surviving in near - isolation for so long , they disappeared around 700 years ago			1
pictured is a site of the @entity11 culture , the last of the @entity0 ‘ ever since the discovery of a @entity0 culture in the @entity2 in 1925 , archaeologists have been mystified by their relationship with the @entity101 culture ancestors of the modern @entity5 , ’ said co-author dr @entity189 from the @entity190 at the @entity191			2
‘ @entity0 culture was replaced rapidly around 1300 and 1400 ad , their only traces being references to ' @entity11 ' in @entity5 mythology and adoption of some elements of @entity11 technology			0
‘ this new genomic research settles outstanding issues in @entity2 archaeology that have been debated for nearly a century , finding that @entity0 and @entity209 people were genetically distinct , with separate origins in @entity211 , and the @entity0 remained isolated in the @entity212 for thousands of years with no significant mixing with each other or with @entity53 , @entity215 , or other @entity216 , ’ continued dr @entity189			1
the lack of inbreeding with other species is surprising , as many species of human have been known to mingle in this way in the past			0
in fact , it is thought that @entity225 were gradually phased out through breeding with modern humans			0
' elsewhere , as soon as people meet each other , they have sex , ' @entity120 told @entity231			0
' even potentially different species like @entity225 [ and modern humans ] had sex , so this finding is extremely surprising			0

research led by the @entity21 provides new theories as to the disappearance of @entity0
this group , the first inhabitants of the @entity2 , disappeared 700 years ago
their extinction is a mystery , as they vanished in mere decades
this disappearance coincides with their descendants arriving in the @entity2
they may have been driven out by technologically superior people
their food sources may also have dwindled as temperatures changed
and extensive inbreeding could have caused a number of medical problems
