with streets and tube trains packed with workers and tourists jostling for space , central @entity0 can be anything but relaxing			0
but an oasis of calm away from packed public transport could soon be on its way with a piece of countryside set to land on the @entity13			0
@entity14 , the creator of the @entity16 cauldron , has unveiled plans for a £ 60million bridge full of trees and flower beds to span the river from @entity22 to the @entity23			1
it would be the first new crossing across the @entity13 since the ' wobbly ' @entity26 opened in 2002 and @entity0 's answer to @entity29 's @entity28 , where a disused train line has been transformed into a lush aerial park			1

it could open as soon as 2016 and give stunning views along the river of @entity39 and the @entity40 to the east			1

@entity14 , left , has found a celebrity supporter for the garden bridge in @entity72 , right ' it will be the slowest way to cross the river , as people will dawdle and lean on parapets and stare at the great cityscapes all around ; but it will also be a safe and swift way for the weary commuter to make his way back over the @entity13			1
' i believe it will bring to londoners and visitors alike peace and beauty and magic			0
' @entity102 , @entity0 's deputy mayor for transport , told the @entity51 : ' the mayor has been keen to find an iconic piece of green infrastructure that can symbolise @entity0 as a high quality of life place to live			0
