by @entity0 published : 06:31 est , 19 august 2013 updated : 13:10 est , 19 august 2013 an abandoned village that was commandeered by the army during the war has its first new residents in 70 years - colonies of rare native honey bees			1
the deserted village of @entity8 on @entity9 has been picked as the ideal location for a project aimed at boosting the population of the endangered @entity14 black bee			1
about 95 per cent of bees in the @entity14 are non-native and were introduced here in the 1920s after a disease virtually wiped out the indigenous honey bee			1
fresh start : bee keeper @entity21 is pictured in front of what is left of the deserted village of @entity8 on the @entity9 where he hopes to build new colonies of @entity14 black bees abandoned : the village , pictured around 1900 , was commandeered by the army so soldiers could practice ahead of the d - day landings during @entity32 new home : the deserted village of @entity8 , near @entity35 , @entity36 , is now surrounded by nectar - rich wildflowers which make the spot ideal to introduce new colonies of the endangered @entity14 black bee despite this , the bee population has been drastically decreasing in the @entity14 and around the world primarily because of man - made problems			1
change in climate and agricultural practices such as misuse of pesticides is one of the reasons for the decline combined with the loss of their natural habitat			0
most crops - about 70 per cent - require pollination to develop fruits , nuts , and seeds			2
if the bee population continues to dwindle , we could face a food epidemic on a global scale			0
beekeeper @entity21 now hops to reverse that trend by reintroducing @entity14 's native bee			1
boosting numbers : it is hoped the project will help boost the dwindling population of the @entity14 black bee conservation effort : @entity21 has received permission from the @entity73 to set up 14 colonies of @entity14 black bees near @entity77 church is @entity8 to help prevent the species from going extinct military site : the area surrounding @entity8 village is off limits for more than 300 days a year while the army practice drills and he chose @entity8 as the perfect spot to introduce 14 colonies of @entity14 black bees that wo n’t be interfered with by competing foreign flying insects			1
@entity8 was evacuated in december 1943 by the military for training @entity89 soldiers preparing for the d - day invasion			1
villagers were told at the time they would be allowed to return within six months			0
however , despite public appeals , their hopes were never realised and to this day it remains completely empty			0
the village is located on @entity9 and is owned by the @entity73 ( @entity73 )			1
it is now surrounded by a high explosive ' impact area ' in the @entity9 military training zone			2
but a 700 - year - old church , @entity77 , still stands in the village as does a manor house called @entity102 as well as a farmhouse , a farm and cottages			2
the village also has four council house style blocks which were built in 1938			0
in 1943 , there was also a @entity109 which was demolished in the late 1970s			0
the government began buying land on @entity9 in the late 19th century to use it for maneuvers			2
and in the 1920s , it began to purchase farms around @entity8 as well as the village 's land			1
by the time of the @entity32 , the government owned almost all of the land in and around the village			2
on november 1 , 1943 , the people of the village were called to a meeting in the schoolroom and given just 47 days ' notice to leave their homes			0
despite some villagers being upset at having to leave , many showed no resistance , seeing it as their duty to contribute to the war effort			0
following the war , the village was still used for training soldiers - especially those who were serving in @entity138			2
in the 1970s a number of distinctive - looking houses were built to aid army training on the site			2
the isolated hamlet is five miles from the nearest colony of common bees and is surrounded by a wealth of untapped , nectar - rich wildflowers on the vast @entity9			1
this will give the @entity14 black bees a chance to thrive and breed a pure strain of the species			1
if it is a success , the project could be repeated in other areas of the country			0
@entity14 black bees are much darker than their golden - coloured cousins that originate from southern @entity159 and have thicker and longer hair			1
they are able to easily survive @entity14 winters unlike the non-native varieties that are vulnerable to prolonged harsh and cold weather , such as last winter			2
@entity8 , near @entity35 , @entity36 , was one of several villages in @entity14 to be taken over by the army in @entity32 so troops could practise for @entity168			1
the 200 residents were compensated and rehoused			0
out of the 56 buildings that made up the hamlet only 14 remain standing today			0
beekeeper @entity21 , from @entity9 , has been given special permission by the @entity73 to set up 14 colonies of black bees behind @entity77 church			1
mr @entity21 , a 61 - year - old retired army major , said : ' @entity8 is a very isolated area with not a lot of feral bee colonies about , in fact there is n’t one in a four or five mile radius			1
' the area is very rich in wild flowers			0
eighteen of the 22 top nectar producing plants in the @entity14 are right here , including clover , sainfoin , viper ’s bugloss , knapweed and melilot			2
there is also no interference from the public			0
' it is very difficult to breed pure lines of bees because it only takes a few feral ones to give you a mongrel breed			0
' but @entity8 gives us a great chance to breed a pure strain of @entity14 black bees			1
' the native honeybees are extinct in all but a handful of remote areas of @entity14 thanks to the mystery virus known as the @entity211 which devastated the native population in the early 20th century			2
beekeepers were forced to bring in colonies from southern @entity159 , @entity215 and @entity216			0
mr @entity21 said : ' black bees make up about four per cent of the bee population of @entity14			1
' it is a shame because they are ideal for the @entity14 climate because they survive our winters very well			0
' it is the native bee and the one that has been selected by nature to be the best type for this country			0
' @entity232 bees need a lot of feeding up in august and september to get them through the winter but they really struggle when you have harsher , prolonged winters			0
' a lot of bees did die out last winter which means there is a reduction this year in honey production and fruits that depend on being pollinated by bees			0
' memorial : a memorial stone in the old @entity109 cemetery in @entity8 to remember the 200 - strong community who were forced to move when the army needed to use the area for d - day preparations during @entity32 growing crisis : black bees now only make up four per cent of the bee population in @entity14 local produce : the @entity14 bee is better equipped to deal with winters in the @entity14 than their southern @entity232 cousins which die in the cold weather causing a reduced honey production			1

hamlet of @entity8 on @entity9 was commandeered by the army for troops to practise ahead of d - day landings during @entity32
village has remained *property* of @entity73 for the last 70 years
it is now being used to help reintroduce the endangered @entity14 black bee
