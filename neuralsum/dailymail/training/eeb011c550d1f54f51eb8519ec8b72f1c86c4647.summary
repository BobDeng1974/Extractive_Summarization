by @entity0 last updated at 5:07 pm on 7th december 2011 @entity2 's new ' timeline ' feature - a new , deeper profile which allows you to ' fill in ' more of your life @entity6 - was announced with some fanfare in september			2
at the time , @entity9 promised , ' you can tell the whole story of your life on a single page '			2
now it seems that the company is to launch timeline - but only in @entity16			2
the ' timeline ' view will give your @entity2 page a more ' magazine - like ' feel - and will , @entity9 promises , ' tell the story of your life '			1
so far , though , only @entity16 can enjoy it timeline allows you to organise your life into a chronological view - and you can even add the years ' @entity22 ' the redesigned pages have a more magazine - like photo - heavy feel , with a large ' cover photo ' at the top of the page			1
on the right of the page there will be a timeline that breaks down all posts from a person 's time on @entity2 and allows viewers to jump back to people 's earliest posts with a break down month - by - month			1
' we announced @entity15 in september and made it available to developers building apps on our platform , ' the company said via a blog post today			0
' starting today , we are making @entity15 more widely available as we measure speed and other types of performance			0
' ' we 'll begin by making it available to people in @entity16 and then roll it out more broadly in the near future			0
' timeline has been available to a million developers in an early test version already - but has not been available to the public at all so far			0
@entity16 has been chosen , presumably , because it has a relatively low population - just 4.4 million - and is @entity58 - speaking , allowing @entity2 to iron out early problems with the service			0
even before launch , some have pointed out that @entity15 , with its month - by - month approach , may have some unwanted side effects , such as allowing people to see who ' defriended ' them and when .			1

rest of us can *expect* to see update ' in near future '
update lets you fill in life ' @entity22 '
month - by - month view gives profiles a ' magazine ' feel
