underground tanks that hold a mix of toxic radioactive waste at @entity4 's most contaminated nuclear site pose a possible risk of explosion			1
a nuclear safety board made the announcement in advance of confirmation hearings for the next leader of the @entity12			0
state and federal officials have long known that hydrogen gas could build up inside the tanks at the @entity17 , leading to an explosion that would release radioactive material			1
the @entity20 recommended additional monitoring and ventilation of the tanks last fall , and federal officials were working to develop a plan to implement the recommendation			2
the federal government created @entity17 in the 1940s as part of the secret @entity48 to build the atomic bomb			1
it spends billions of dollars to clean up the 586 - square - mile ( 1518 - square - kilometer ) site neighboring the @entity52 , the southern border between @entity53 and @entity54 and the @entity56 's largest waterway			0
federal officials have said six underground tanks at the site are leaking into the soil , threatening the groundwater , and technical problems have delayed construction of a plant to treat the waste for long - term safe disposal			2
those issues are likely to come up during confirmation hearings next week for energy secretary - nominee @entity68			0
the fears of explosion and contamination could give @entity53 and @entity54 officials more clout as they push for cleanup of the @entity76 - era site			0
@entity78 to the cleanup is the removal of 56 million gallons ( 212 million liters ) of highly radioactive , toxic waste left from plutonium production from underground tanks			0
many of the site 's single - shell tanks , which have just one wall , have leaked in the past , and state and federal officials announced in february that six such tanks are leaking anew			0
tanks on the site were put in place in the 1940s but are long past their 20 - year life span the nuclear safety board warned about the risk of explosion to @entity40 , who wanted comment on the safety and operation of @entity17 's tanks , technical issues that have been raised about the design of a plant to treat the waste in those tanks , and @entity17 's overall safety culture			1
in addition to the leaks , the board noted concerns about the potential for hydrogen gas buildup within a tank , in particular those with a double wall , which contain deadly waste that was previously pumped out of the leaking single - shell tanks			1
' all the double - shell tanks contain waste that continuously generates some flammable gas , ' the board said			0
' this gas will eventually reach flammable conditions if adequate ventilation is not provided			0
' all of the tanks are actively ventilated , which means they have blowers and fans to prevent a buildup of hydrogen gas , and those systems are monitored to ensure they are operating as intended , @entity12 spokeswoman @entity124 said			1
' @entity12 is absolutely committed to ensuring the safety of @entity17 's underground tanks , ' @entity124 said			2
the @entity4 government spends about $ 2 billion annually on @entity137 - roughly one - third of its entire budget for nuclear cleanup nationally all of the tanks are actively ventilated , which means they have blowers and fans to prevent a buildup of hydrogen gas ( file photo ) inquiries began after it was discovered one tank was leaking at the @entity17 nuclear site , but the full extent of the problem was yet to be discovered ( file photo )			1
