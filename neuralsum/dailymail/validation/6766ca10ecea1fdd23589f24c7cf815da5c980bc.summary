tens of thousands of serious criminals are being let off with just a slap on the wrist because of lazy police officers , a report claims today			0
almost one in three crimes is ‘ inappropriately ’ punished with a police caution or penalty notice , including some that carry a maximum sentence of life imprisonment , such as rape , mps say			1
some 86,000 offences that could have gone before a @entity16 were dealt with out of court in the year to june 2014 , they add			1
@entity18 : tens of thousands of serious criminals are being let off with just a slap on the wrist because of lazy police officers , a report claims today the @entity21 points to an ‘ alarming ’ rise of the caution culture – which grew and peaked under the @entity25 government – and says this has damaged public confidence in the justice system			1
the committee ’s report concludes that too often , police used cautions as a ‘ time - saving tool ’ rather than the correct way of tackling an offence			1
in total , police issued 318,500 of the so - called out - of - court disposals , mostly for minor offences , in 2013 - 14 , down from 660,965 in 2008			1
despite ministers insisting cautions are ‘ inappropriate ’ for serious offences , 70 sexual and violent offenders a week received one in the past four years			1
@entity44 , @entity25 chairman of the committee , said : ‘ the inappropriate use of out - of - court disposals to deal with serious offences is unacceptable			1
‘ it is alarming that they are not being used in the correct way in up to 30 per cent of cases			2
‘ we can not allow the misuse of out - of - court disposals in serious cases to continue			2
the public deserve to feel reassured that their local police forces are not tackling serious crimes with a slap on the wrist			2
’ @entity44 , @entity25 chairman of the committee , said the ' inappropriate use of out - of - court disposals to deal with serious offences unacceptable			1
the committee also says the use of cautions has resulted in a ‘ postcode lottery ’			2
in @entity71 , 49 per cent of offences were brought to justice , compared with 26 per cent in @entity73			0
at the peak , one in ten of all solved cases was dealt with by out - of - court disposals			2
by last year , it had fallen to fewer than one in 20			0
the report found that cautions could save the police time and money by cutting bureaucracy , allowing front - line officers to spend more time pounding the beat			0
arresting an offender takes almost three hours of police time , and charging someone takes five hours			0
but too many cautions were being handed out ‘ inappropriately ’ , says the committee			1
the report welcomes reforms being introduced by justice secretary @entity93 that will end the caution culture which led to criminals being let off with a warning			1
six types of out - of - court disposals will be replaced with just two which are designed to compel offenders to make some form of reparation			0
minor criminals will be told they must apologise to victims or repair damage they have caused to prevent a court appearance			0
more serious offenders will be give a ‘ suspended prosecution ’ , which means they must meet a set of conditions such as paying a fine and going on a rehabilitation course to avoid further punishment			0
last year the @entity113 revealed that 90 rapists have received only a caution since the @entity116 came to power			0
in total , police issued almost 15,000 for offences that would typically result in jail , including 2,279 for sexual assault , 783 for robbery and 11,347 for burglary .			0
