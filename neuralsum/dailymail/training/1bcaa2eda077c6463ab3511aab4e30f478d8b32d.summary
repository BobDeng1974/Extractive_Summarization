@entity0 paid a nice tribute to @entity4 ’s cancer - suffering winger @entity2 in their matchday programme			1
but they also had a little bit of mischievous fun , bizarrely quoting @entity4 ’s odds to win the @entity9 – an outlandish 5,000 - 1			1
they did not , however , mention that they themselves are 2,500 - 1 ! it ’s fair to say that quoting the odds on relegation would have been a little more relevant			1
incidentally , @entity0 are 9 - 1 for the drop while @entity4 are as short as 4 - 1			1
@entity2 of @entity4 in action against @entity18 ( left ) and @entity19 of @entity20 last season @entity4 ’s @entity21 was revealed as having two wives and a mistress on monday morning			0
the midfielder was only rumbled when his mistress found out about his second marriage , for he had promised to marry her as well			0
ironically , it was also on monday that manager @entity28 revealed his love for the @entity30 on the pages of @entity32 , saying : ‘ i love him			0
i just love that he ’s a winner ’			0
mr @entity21 , it seems , is a man in demand			0
@entity21 of @entity4 battles with @entity37 of @entity0 on monday evening the @entity38 wore their garish new third kit for the first time , a pea green and navy design which was unveiled earlier this month			1
quite why they need a third kit is beyond most supporters and only one of the 2,500 in the away end could be seen sporting the jersey			0
their previous ‘ blue and green ’ kit was worn for just one match in the mid nineties			2
that , however , brought them a little more luck , @entity55 scoring the only goal at @entity57 on that occasion			0
@entity4 's previous ‘ blue and green ’ kit was worn for just one match in the mid nineties @entity4 owner @entity61 was last heard outside of a @entity63 pub saying @entity28 was ‘ dead , finished and over ’ if the team were beaten here at @entity0			1
well , the billionaire was in attendance and he arrived in a chauffeur - driven people carrier before being shielded from the rain by a @entity0 official as he entered the stadium			2
dressed in his trademark black - and - white tie and white shirt , @entity61 stopped to sign autographs , to which one fan hollered , ‘ are you signing a cheque , @entity61 ? ’			1
if his club remains in and around the relegation zone then he may well be forced to open his cheque book for real come january			0
@entity4 owner @entity61 in the stands at the @entity83			2

@entity0 did not , however , mention that they themselves are 2,500 - 1
@entity4 wore their garish new green and blue third kit for the first time
@entity61 stopped to sign autographs before the match
