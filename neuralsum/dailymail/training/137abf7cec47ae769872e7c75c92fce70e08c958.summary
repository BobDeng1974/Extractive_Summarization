by @entity0 @entity1 branded himself ' an a-hole ' as he once again begged for forgiveness over his ' insensitive ' @entity5 interview in which he claimed @entity6 is ' a town run by @entity7			1
' the actor insisted he ' should have known better ' as he made an appearance to promote @entity10 on @entity11 on wednesday			2
in an interview the chat show host admitted he thought would be cancelled , the @entity15 star insisted he had no idea how much ill - feeling his rant , in which he complained about political correctness , would cause			1
so sorry : @entity1 again begged for forgiveness over his now infamous @entity5 interview on @entity11 on wednesday @entity1 , who is in the middle of promoting his forthcoming summer blockbuster , caused outrage after claiming @entity23 is ' all right , ' despite the actor 's previous use of anti-semitic and racist epithets			1
he said : ' it was an article i did with @entity5 and i said some things that were poorly considered , and once i had seen it in print , i could see it was , um , offensive , insensitive , pernicious and ill - informed			1
' and , uh , well , words have meaning , they carry weight , they carry on long after you 've said them , and i do n't condone or excuse the words i used in any context			2
i just basically should n't have used them in any context			0
but i did an i have deeply injured and wounded a great many people			0
' no case for the defence : the @entity15 actor made no excuses for his expletive filled interview public figure : @entity1 said he had set a bad example and apologised to the fans he lovingly calls @entity54 saving his bacon ? it remains to be seen whether his grovelling will stop @entity10 from sinking at the box office working class @entity1 , who is the son of a welder , then thanked the chat show star for allowing him on his show to make his apology			2
he said : ' it gives me the opportunity to say to those people that i am , from my heart , i am profoundly , profoundly sorry and deeply apologetic , especially to the fans because they have been so incredible to me and very loyal			0
' the actor then said he should have been mindful to be a better role model to the supporters he calls @entity54			0
he said : ' i am a public figure , i should be an example and inspiration and i am an a — hole			0
so to them i say i extend my apology and my love and best wishes to my fan base			0
' the @entity83 star also took a shot at the media for wanting stars to be more than mere performers			0
@entity1 said : ' i just think that we 're public figures and sometimes we 're looked upon , we 're are asked to be , social or cultural or political commentators , and , i ca n't speak for other people , but i 'm not , clearly			0
a musing actor : the @entity93 star was thinking before speaking this time as he chatted with @entity95 really ? the @entity97 favourite made the confession he is unqualified to be a social commentator ' i stepped out of my area of expertise and i just landed both feet in a hornets nest			0
' it just came over in a certain way and for that i 'm deeply sorry			0
the @entity106 , who admitted his overlords are ' furious ' at the publicity his comments have attracted , still found time to laugh when @entity95 made ' the most awkward transition possible ' by asking about his new film			2
his guest admitted : ' i only ever wanted to talk about @entity113 , you know , and this thing , this news cycle , this event has i think sadly um , it derailed what my initial purpose was			0
and after talking about how great the cast and crew are he joked , ' its a relief , believe me i desperately want to talk about @entity113			0
' begging for forgiveness : @entity1 has issued a grovelling apology over his controversial new @entity5 interview the @entity128 star had already made a grovelling apology to the @entity130 , he issued his fawning apology , in which he hailed @entity7 as ' the chosen people			1
' however the gorup 's national national director @entity133 was no impressed , saying “ at this point , we are not satisfied with what we received			2
his apology is insufficient and not satisfactory			0
' he added the group ' just began a conversation with his managing producer , ' who had claimed the star 's comments had been taken out of context			1
this was despite @entity1 sending a statement to the group in which he addressed the ' gentlemen ' of the organisation			0
he wrote : ' i am deeply remorseful that comments i recently made in the @entity152 were offensive to many @entity7 people			1
' upon reading my comments in print - i see how insensitive they may be , and how they may indeed contribute to the furtherance of a false stereotype			1
' anything that contributes to this stereotype is unacceptable , including my own words on the matter			2
' @entity165 favourite went further as he tried to distance himself from his statements in the forthcoming edition of the pornography magazine , insisting he is a huge admirer of the contribution @entity7 people have made to showbusiness			1
he said : ' if , during the interview , i had been asked to elaborate on this point i would have pointed out that i had just finished reading @entity176 ’s superb book about the @entity7 and @entity6 , @entity177 : how the @entity7 invented @entity6			1
' the fact is that our business , and my own career specifically , owes an enormous debt to that contribution			0
' i hope you will know that this apology is heartfelt , genuine , and that i have an enormous personal affinity for the @entity7 people in general , and those specifically in my life			2
' he then finished by begging for forgiveness , going as far as to say he is unworthy of using a @entity194 greeting meaning ' peace be upon you			0
' the self described libertarian said : '' the jewish people , persecuted thorough the ages , are the first to hear @entity202 ’s voice , and surely are the chosen people			0
@entity1 's controversial interview has derailed his tour promoting @entity10 ' i would like to sign off with “ @entity206 ” — but under the circumstances , perhaps today i lose the right to use that phrase , so i will wish you all peace			2
' @entity1 , who is in the middle of promoting his forthcoming @entity10 film , caused outrage after claiming @entity23 is ' all right , ' despite the actor 's previous use of anti-semitic and racist epithets			1
he also claimed the current vogue of political correctness was rife with hypocrisy			0
the @entity93 star insisted : ' @entity23 is in a town that ’s run by @entity7 and he said the wrong thing because he ’s actually bitten the hand that i guess has fed him - and does n’t need to feed him anymore because he ’s got enough dough			1
' he ’s like an outcast , a leper , you know ? '' but some @entity7 guy in his office somewhere has n’t turned and said , “ that f * * * ing kraut ” or “ f * * * those @entity234 , ” whatever it is ? we all hide and try to be so politically correct			1
that 's what gets me			2
' @entity23 , 58 , made @entity240 slurs when he was arrested for suspected drink - driving in @entity242 in 2006 , two years after his film @entity243 was criticised for depicting @entity7 negatively			1
' he 's alright ' : @entity1 claimed ' everyone ' has used racial slurs like @entity23 and should forgive him his words prompted an angry backlash , with antisemitism group the @entity130 's national director @entity133 saying : ' he should know better than to repeat and give credence to tired anti-semitic tropes			1
' @entity23 ’s ostracization in @entity6 was not a matter of being " politically incorrect , " as mr. @entity1 suggests , but of paying the consequences for outing himself as a bigot and a hater			1
' it is disturbing that mr. @entity1 appears to have bought into mr. @entity23 ’s warped and prejudiced world view			2
' he also added the assertion @entity7 control @entity6 is , ' an anti-semitic stereotype based on the " @entity262 , " the 19th century anti-semitic forgery that suggested @entity7 conspire to control major industries such as banking and finance			1
' the apology is the latest piece of backpeddling from the @entity15 star 's camp , with his manager @entity271 earlier saying : ' this notion that he 's defending @entity23 and @entity273 is preposterous			1
@entity1 would not defend hate speech or any divisive speech			0
the piece lacked a kind of balance on that regard			0
' notorious : @entity23 has been an @entity6 outcast since his infamous drink - driving arrest in @entity242 in 2006			1

defended @entity23 's anti-semitic comments in now - infamous @entity5 interview and insisted @entity6 is a ' town run by @entity7 '
called his forced exile from @entity6 ' politically correct c * * p '
now admits his words were ' insensitive , pernicious and ill - informed '
