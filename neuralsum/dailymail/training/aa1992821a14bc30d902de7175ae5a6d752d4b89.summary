demands : prosecutors want captain coward @entity2 jailed for a total of 2,697 years as they made a request to have him sent back to jail prosecutors want ' captain @entity10 ' @entity2 jailed for a total of 2,697 years as they made a request to have him sent back to jail , it emerged today			1
@entity15 , 52 , is currently under house arrest while investigators consider charges of multiple manslaughter , causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship following the @entity23 liner disaster last month			1
@entity24 lost their lives and at least 17 are still missing after the skipper recklessly changed course and crashed the 114,000 - ton liner onto rocks just so that he could carry out a ' sail by ' salute and impress crew and friends			0
prosecutors say that the spineless captain then abandoned ship , leaving hundreds of people still onboard , while he reached the safety of dry land on the nearby island of @entity40 in a lifeboat			1
last month an investigating judge granted @entity15 house arrest and he is currently serving that at his home in @entity45 near @entity46 , which he shares with his wife @entity47 and teenage daughter			1
today , in a three hour closed door hearing in @entity51 before an appeal court judge , prosecutors argued he be sent back to jail as they fear he may well interfere with evidence and the fact that he fled his ship also raises the possibility he may try and avoid justice			2
lead investigator @entity59 is looking for @entity15 to be given 15 years for multiple manslaughter , ten years for causing a disaster and eight years for every passenger that was abandoned and the same sentence for those that died , with all terms running consecutively			1
that makes a grand total of 2,697 years , as 34 people are believed to have been killed and 300 passengers were abandoned by @entity15 the night of the disaster on january 13			1
prosecutors outlined their demands in a 12 page document handed to judges as they presented their request to have him sent back to jail , while his lawyers argued he should be released			1
listing : the @entity23 is almost entirely on its side , as it continues to slip from its rocky resting place devastation : the ship continues to lie in the water his legal team pointed to the fact that @entity15 had been suspended from his post by the @entity23 's owners @entity91 following the disaster			1
and they added that the incident was ' unique and unrepeatable ' proof they said he would not flee justice and tamper with evidence			0
however , mr @entity59 said @entity15 's reaction when he was originally informed he was being placed under investigation and taken to jail underlined the fact he could try and escape			2
he said : ' when first told he was going to jail , @entity15 asked if he could go to a hotel first and then for something to eat			2
he also has the possibility of escaping to various places across the world			0
' the hearing adjourned its decision until friday			0
dropping in : @entity113 firefighters were lowered from a helicopter onto the ship last month as they desperately looked for bodies wreck : divers ended their search of the ship as it became too dangerous for them to look for bodies meanwhile newspaper adverts were also published today inviting 4,200 passengers and crew who were on the @entity23 to attend a preliminary hearing in @entity124 on march 3			0
twenty three @entity126 holidaymakers were on the @entity23 but they are not under any legal obligation to attend the hearing which will take place in the town 's theatre as the court building is too small			0
costa have already offered compensation of Â£ 9,000 to each holidaymaker affected but many have said they will not accept and instead pursue court action for a higher payout			0
bad weather around @entity40 has led to the search for victims to be suspended and it had also delayed the removal of 500,000 gallons of heavy duty diesel from the @entity23 's tanks			0
delay : salvage workers had to halt operations on the removal of fuel from the tanks of the half - sunken @entity23 cruise ship due to bad weather and rough seas earlier this month scene from a disaster movie : passengers from the @entity23 were taken to safety by lifeboats launched into the night seas last month			2

prosecutors want @entity15 handed 15 years for multiple manslaughter
also call for 10 years in *prison* for causing a disaster
and they demand 8 years for each passenger that was abandoned
and another 8 years each for those that died
