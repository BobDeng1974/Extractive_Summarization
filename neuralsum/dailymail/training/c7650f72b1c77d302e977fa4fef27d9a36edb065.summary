by @entity0 published : 17:35 est , 1 june 2013 updated : 07:24 est , 5 june 2013 when @entity4 ’s six - year - old son @entity3 asked him what a tickle looked like , he went to his desk in the sitting room of their riverside home and drew a round orange character and named him mr @entity11			1
that was in 1971 , and at that point the mr men were born			1
within three years , a million copies of the books were sold			0
@entity4 was able to give up his job in the advertising industry and write not only more mr @entity19 characters but also create the @entity21 series for his twin daughters @entity22 and @entity24			1
today , one of his books sells every 27 seconds			0
colourful past : the extensive riverside property south - west of @entity29 has six bedrooms , a balcony and large conservatory the house where the characters came to life was built in 1956 for @entity4 and his wife @entity36 in the style of a @entity39 minka , or simple country retreat , on the banks of the @entity42 at @entity43 , 14 miles south - west of @entity29			1
@entity4 , who died in 1988 , sold the house – he named it @entity45 – in the mid- 1970s and moved to @entity46 , but today it is back on the market			1
‘ back in the 1950s , it became very popular among people who lived in @entity29 to build a holiday home on the river , particularly in this area and on the islands around @entity59 , ’ says @entity49 , manager of @entity50 , which is selling the six - bedroom house for £ 3.6 million			1
in 1956 , @entity45 was a fairly modest chalet - style house , but it has been transformed into a light , bright , family home with five reception rooms , two kitchens and two guest apartments and makes best use of the fabulous south - facing back garden and its 190ft river frontage			1
it is currently owned by airline executive @entity72 and his partner @entity73 , a surgeon , who ten years ago swapped their former home , a queen anne house less than a mile away , with @entity45 ’s previous owner , @entity78 , a record industry boss			2
birthplace of men : the front room at the property where the very first of the mr men , mr @entity11 , was created in 1971 water view : @entity45 , on the market for £ 3.6million , is located by the river near @entity43 on @entity42 ‘ there was a narrow corridor and a guest toilet and ironing room at the front of the house , and no real views on to the front garden , so we opened it all up , ’ says @entity72 , 48			1
‘ in the dining room , we put folding glass doors , which we can open and make it feel as though we ’re eating outside			0
‘ it ’s a great house for entertaining			0
when @entity78 owned it , he had parties for rock stars and @entity104 spent a lot of time here			0
’ @entity78 added the splendid galleried library with its beautiful @entity109 staircase , which has a bannister in the style of a ship ’s rail			0
there is plenty of space for guests , and the riverside annexe , with a bedsitting room , bathroom and kitchen , would make a wonderful study or artist ’s studio			2
there is also a self - contained one - bedroom flat with its own terrace – and even that has river views			1
@entity72 and @entity73 , 47 , have spent hundreds of thousands of pounds on the house in the ten years they have owned it			0
they spent £ 90,000 alone on the hand - made solid wood kitchen , which includes @entity135 , steam and combination microwave ovens , gas and induction hobs and an integrated coffee machine			1
giggle : @entity142 , is the first book in the @entity19 series by @entity4 which have sold millions there is also a second , smaller kitchen , which is used by caterers when the couple throw parties			2
the stunning conservatory , which stretches across the width of the sitting room and kitchen , cost a further £ 100,000			2
the house is also remarkably private : a high wall and electronic gates hide the front gardens , in which @entity73 and @entity72 keep a flock of rare hens , and at the back the peace is disturbed only by the occasional pleasure boat passing on the river			0
‘ it is incredibly quiet here , especially when you think we ’re so close to @entity29 , ’ says @entity72			0
the couple used to have a boat , which they sailed to @entity171 and @entity172 and once took on a shopping trip to @entity174			0
‘ @entity175 has its own mooring so one @entity176 , when the roads were very busy , we sailed over , did all our @entity176 shopping and sailed home again , ’ says @entity72			2
now the pair are looking for somewhere smaller nearby that they can once more leave their own stamp on			0
at £ 3.6 million , the asking price is a far cry from the £ 2,000 an average house cost back in 1956			2
but the @entity19 empire has seen a similar stratospheric rise in value			0
in 2004 , @entity4 ’s widow @entity36 sold the franchise for £ 28 million , and two years ago it changed hands again – ironically to a @entity39 firm – for a sum believed to be more than twice as much			1
