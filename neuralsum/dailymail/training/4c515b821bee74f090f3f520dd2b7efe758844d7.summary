one way to preserve mental energy is by not agonising over needless decisions the road to health is paved with good intentions			1
so why are we so easily diverted from the path of goodness by sugary snacks and lazy days on the sofa ? the stark truth is that lack of willpower is often to blame			1
but new research shows why we should n't beat ourselves up about our backsliding			2
willpower is a limited resource , the research reveals - there is only so much you have at any time			1
' if we exert self - control and make a lot of willpower - related decisions , our self - control is lower and our capacity for making decisions drops , ' explains professor @entity28 , the author of the bestselling book , @entity17 , and a world expert on the subject			1
' as you make decisions , you gradually deplete the energy you have available and your subsequent decisions are weaker			1
' so presented with just one too many temptations , and it really wo n't be your fault if you break your diet for that donught , it seems			2
mercifully , there are simple ways to boost your willpower			1
the fragile state of human willpower was highlighted last month by researchers who found that men trying to give up tobacco smoked more if shown photos of attractive females			1
psychological tests revealed that not only were they significantly more distracted by sexual thoughts , but they also lit up twice as many cigarettes while completing surveys following the test			2
but why did pretty women make the volunteers ' self - control go up in smoke ? the researchers , from @entity63 's @entity62 , said the men had been put into a ' mating mindset ' that distracted them from their long - term goal of abstinence			1
this is that the theory that exercising self - control demands high levels of energy resources in the brain			1
we have finite resources at any one point , and if that energy is diverted , then restraint wilts			1
some of the earliest evidence of this effect was discovered in 1998 by @entity84 , a psychologist at @entity85 in @entity86			2
he invited volunteers into a room containing plates of cookies and a bowl of radishes			2
half the volunteers were invited to eat the cookies , while the others were told to resist the treat and eat radishes instead			2
the volunteers were then given 30 minutes in which to tackle a difficult puzzle			2
the volunteers who resisted the cookies gave up on the puzzle after about eight minutes			2
the cookie - eaters persevered for an average of nearly 19 minutes			0
volunteers who had gone for a walk ate half as much chocolate as those who had simply rested lacking the self - control to avoid sweet treats , or to stop smoking , is dangerous enough			0
more disturbingly , lack of long - term willpower also contributes to the way in which millions of people in @entity115 fail to keep taking daily medicines prescribed to treat life - threatening illnesses such as arthritis , hypertension and breast cancer			1
a survey by led by the @entity122 published in august reported that more than a quarter of rheumatoid arthritis patients prescribed anti-inflammatory medication failed to take it properly within six months of the treatment 's start			0
meanwhile an analysis of patients ' urine samples by the @entity132 revealed in april that least one in four people with high blood pressure has abandoned their medication or takes too little to combat their risk of heart problems			0
researchers are now trying to fathom why so many patients fail to take medicines that can so powerfully enhance their health			0
unwanted side - effects must play an important part			0
but @entity145 , a chartered counselling psychologist who has worked with patients on their ability to stick to medication says that lack of lasting willpower is an important factor			1
one basic problem is that patients ' willpower fades over time as their powers of resolve fade and they begin to feel better thanks to the medication			1
so their resolution to keep to the prescribed regimen disappears before they get to the end of the course of drugs , ' says @entity163 , who practises in @entity164 and @entity165			0
' some doctors are very good at putting the fear of @entity168 into patients , saying things such as " take your medicines or i wo n't be responsible for the what happens to you			0
" ' but psychological research has found a range of less draconian , and rather surprising , ways in which people can boost the strength of their willpower			1
according to professor @entity28 , one simple way to preserve your banks of mental energy is by not wasting it agonising over needless decisions			1
he cites the case of president @entity190 , who generally only wears blue or grey suits so that deciding what to wear is one decision he does n't have to make			1
' likewise , you do n't want to waste willpower making decisions about breakfast			1
having a set morning routine is much better , ' says he says			0
another trick is to take short and simple exercise			0
a study performed at the @entity202 , two years ago , set out to discover what might help people to resist the temptation of fattening foods			0
the investigators asked volunteers either to rest for 15 minutes or to spend the time going for a walk			0
they were then all asked to perform a series of dull but demanding computer tasks			0
next to their keyboards was positioned a bowl of chocolates			0
at the end of the test , the researchers reported in the journal @entity221 that the volunteers who had gone for a walk ate half as much chocolate as those who had simply rested			0
the researchers believe that light exercise energises people sufficiently to revive their brains ' flagging resources and thus bolster their will power			0
another scientifically backed way to boost willpower is to replenish your brain with fuel and rest			1
glucose can help with this , according to a study in the journal @entity240 in 2008			0
the @entity85 research showed that drinking sugar - sweetened lemonade restored flagging resolve in people whose willpower had been depleted by having to complete intelligence tests			1
sugar - free lemonade did not bring the same benefit			0
you make decisions , deplete energy , and subsequent decisions are weaker the research also indicates why crash - dieters are almost doomed to fail - their brains lack the fuel to keep their resolve going			1
keeping up your glucose might help when you need willpower for quitting smoking , for example , but is obviously of little help if you are trying to stick to a diet			1
however , other research has shown that getting a full night 's sleep significantly helps people to resist temptation the following day			0
this is because sleep plays an important role in regenerating levels of glucose in the prefrontal cortex , the area of the brain that is associated with self - control , according to a study published in the journal , @entity278 and @entity279			0
but perhaps the most important way to boost your willpower is to convince yourself that you can be strong			1
this appears to work as a self - fulfilling belief			0
several recent studies have demonstrated that volunteers who believe their reserves of self - control are inexhaustible perform much better in tests of willpower than people who think theirs can be worn out			2
indeed , a study of 148 volunteers last year by @entity294 and @entity295 psychologists in the journal @entity296 has found that people who are convinced of the strength of their willpower can exercise far greater self - control while their brains are sugar - depleted than those who believe their resolve is prone to wavering			2
the research team , led by dr @entity303 , a psychologist at @entity304 , concluded that , ' people have far greater capacity to exert self - control than they may believe			0
' it 's what our @entity309 forebears would have called developing one 's ' moral backbone '			0
indeed , when it comes to exercising willpower , one might do best to quote the carmaker @entity317 , who famously once declared : ' whether you think you can , or whether you think you ca n't , you 're right .			2

prof @entity28 , author of book @entity17 , is expert on the subject
you make decisions , deplete energy , and subsequent decisions are weaker
' you do *nâ€™t* want to waste willpower making decisions about breakfast '
