the @entity9 sank during a hurricane off the @entity16 coast in 1857 , taking 425 souls and up to 21 tons of gold to the ocean floor			1
the bullion had been shipped from @entity21 to the west coast of @entity23 , then sent by rail to the @entity27 nation 's east coast and finally loaded onto the 280 - foot steamship bound for @entity29			1
in 1983 , @entity5 , of @entity30 , @entity31 , organized an expedition to find the epic ship and recover the treasure , promising his investors major returns if his mission is a success			1
five years later , on september 11 , 1988 , @entity5 announced to much fanfare that his team , the @entity9 , had found the shipwreck , but the big payday never came			1
although books have been written about the search for the @entity9 , it remains unclear to this day how much gold was recovered from the underwater site , @entity47 reported			1
it has been reported , however , that @entity5 sold bars and coins to a @entity52 mint for $ 52million , but his investors , including a @entity30 newspaper tycoon and a prominent auto dealer , say they have not seen a dime of it			1
@entity5 ’s crew made up of nine technicians who helped locate the ‘ @entity9 ’ and recover the treasure from the ocean floor 8,000 feet deep have been locked in a drawn - out legal battle to get more than $ 2million that they say their former boss still owes them			1
this engraving shows the sinking of the @entity9 , which sank in a storm of the coast of the @entity71 with the loss of 426 lives and £ 1.3million worth of gold cargo ‘ there is very little reason to doubt that these plaintiffs will prevail and in an amount in excess of $ 2 million , ’ @entity75 , an attorney for the technicians , told @entity47			1
‘ and all they see from the defendants is delay , delay , delay			0
’ earlier this month , @entity88 district judge @entity87 issued a warrant for 60 - year - old @entity5 , but so far , efforts by @entity2 to find him have proven fruitless			1
they have no current photo of him , and it seems that no one has laid an eye on him in years			0
one of @entity5 ’s attorneys said that his client is ‘ at sea			2
’ supervisory deputy u.s. marshal @entity98 told @entity47 that investigators are pursuing a ‘ number of leads ’ and hope to have @entity5 in custody soon			2
@entity104 mission : @entity5 began searching for the @entity9 in 1983 after reading witness accounts of the shipwreck judge @entity87 temporarily blocked the sale or transfer of 500 restrike gold coins made from some of the gold discovered in the shipwreck			1
those coins were included in part of a deal in 2000 to sell rights to the remaining treasure to the @entity117 for $ 52million , leaving about $ 30million after the cost of recovery efforts			0
@entity87 also ordered @entity5 to disclose the location of those coins , as well as funds from a trust			2
‘ we have reason to believe that the 500 coins still exist somewhere and that ’s why it ’s so important for [ @entity5 ] to come to court as he ’s been ordered and to answer what the plaintiffs and the judge want answered , ’ the attorney for @entity5 ’s crewmen said			2
bullion : these gold nuggets , bars and coins from the @entity9 lay on the ocean floor for over 140 years until their recovery in 1987 by @entity88 firm @entity9 court battles : @entity5 's nine crew members sued the salvager , claiming that he failed to pay them more than $ 2million according to @entity5 ’s own attorneys , the reclusive treasure hunter is not aware that there is a warrant out for his arrest			1
‘ it ’s my understanding when he does come back from sea he has every intention of complying with that court ’s order , ’ attorney @entity148 said			0
‘ obviously , he will return			0
’ @entity5 has been mired in legal battles with a host of insurance companies , rival treasure hunters and a group of 161 investors who put up $ 12.7million to finance the expedition			1
' @entity163 with historical appeal ' : the gold ingot which is set to go on sale at @entity167 in @entity168 , @entity52 , next month in 1998 , after years of litigation , @entity5 and his companies were rewarded 92 per cent of the recovered gold , with the rest going to insurance companies that paid claims after the steamship sank , according to the @entity176			1
eight years later , the team of nine technicians filed a federal lawsuit to seek the millions they claim is due to them for finding the most famous shipwreck of its time			0
the gold ship , a 278ft - long sidewheel steamer , had 578 passengers and crew on board when she left the @entity23 port of @entity191 on september 3 1857 , bound for @entity29 under the command of @entity193			1
after a stop in @entity195 , she continued north up the @entity88 east coast until , on september 9 , she was caught in a category 2 hurricane off the coast of the @entity71			0
after two days rocked by the fierce tempest , the @entity9 's sails were shredded , she was taking on water , and her boiler was on the verge of being extinguished			2
her fate was sealed when one of the seals to the paddle wheels sprang a leak and , by noon that day , her engineers could keep the boiler 's fire burning no longer			0
the resulting fall in steam pressure shut down both the pumps that were keeping water at bay and the paddle wheels that had kept her bow to the wind			0
in an attempt to draw attention to their plight , passengers and crew flew the ship 's flag upside down , a universal sign of distress , to try to signal a passing ship			2
a bucket brigade was formed and her passengers and crew spent the night fighting a losing battle against the rising water			0
as the ship passed the eye of the storm , engineers made vain attempts to relight the boiler			0
the second half of the storm then struck			0
without power the @entity9 was carried along with the hurricane , unable to escape the powerful winds			2
the next morning two ships were spotted and 153 passengers , mainly women and children , managed to make their way over in lifeboats			0
however the intense winds and heavy seas pulled the @entity9 and the rest of her company away from any hope of rescue			2
by 8pm that night , the ship sank with them - and her precious cargo - still aboard			2
earlier this month , a gold bar recovered from the steamship was put on the auction block with an estimate set at 211 times it 's original value			0
stamped on the 40 - ounce @entity268 is the bar ’s original value of $ 743.70 along with ‘ @entity271 and @entity272 ’			0
the reverse is a plain casting save for the serial number 648 repeated at the top			0
the @entity9 was recovered by @entity31 - based treasure hunters @entity9 using a remote - controlled submarine in @entity280 , led by @entity5 , located the wreck using bayesian search theory , where a number of factors are taken into account direct the search for lost @entity288 amounts of gold and other artifacts were then recovered and brought to the surface using another remote - controlled sub built specifically for the @entity293 the mr @entity5 announced the find , 39 insurance companies filed a suit claiming they had a right to the gold , on the grounds that they had paid out the damages for its loss in the 19th @entity303 team that found it argued in court that the gold had been abandoned and , after a legal battle , they were awarded 92 per cent of the treasure trove in 1996.the total value of the recovered gold was estimated at $ 150million			1
