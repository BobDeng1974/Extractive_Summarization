work and pensions secretary @entity1 used a major speech today to outline his latest reforms of the welfare system , announcing that from later this month jobseekers will have to prepare a cv and agree to weekly meetings with an adviser before being given benefits			1
mr @entity1 also suggested that the ‘ open door immigration ’ policy run by the last government had meant foreign workers taking jobs and helping to trap @entity22 people in ‘ dependency , hopelessness and despair ’			1
later this week , employment minister @entity26 will flesh out the government ’s efforts to restrict benefits for jobless foreigners			1
welfare minister @entity31 will also set out plans to make welfare cheats sell their homes if necessary to pay higher fines to reimburse taxpayers for the money they have wrongly claimed			0
ministers aim to reduce the proportion of benefits lost to fraud and error from 2.2 per cent in 2010 to 1.7 per cent by next march			0
mr @entity1 points to the strength of the @entity22 labour market - with record numbers of people in work , accompanied by dramatic falls in worklessness - as evidence that his reforms are having an impact			1
welfare reform has been a crucial part of @entity22 ’s recovery , helping to create ‘ a stable economy matched by a strong society where people are ready and capable of work ’ , ’ he said			0
under @entity66 , he argues , ‘ a combination of the welfare system trapping people in dependency and removing the drive to go to work ... and the open door immigration policy meant @entity22 people were so easily replaced by foreign workers coming in ’			0
‘ taxpayers paid a financial cost for rising welfare payments , and society paid the cost as well – with too many of our own fellow citizens falling into dependency , hopelessness , and despair , ’ mr @entity1 added			2
that situation is now being turned around , with @entity22 nationals making up nearly 90 per cent of the rise in employment in the last year , he insisted			0
the unemployed will no longer be able simply to ¿ sign on ¿ for benefits and welfare cheats are to face higher fines and losing their homes , ministers will say this week ‘ @entity66 ’s @entity87 slashed 7.2 % off our economy and cost 750,000 people their jobs , ’ he added			2
‘ following the crash we heard gloomy forecasts of a million jobs disappearing from the private sector , mass unemployment , lost generations - yet they could not have proved more wrong			0
‘ @entity22 ’s economic recovery is established and taking hold faster than forecast – and nowhere are the signs of this recovery clearer than in our labour market			0
’ the tightening of the welfare system , as well as the government ’s pro-business measures , have helped give businesses the freedom and confidence to create 1.7 million new jobs since the election			1
mr @entity1 , speaking to the @entity112 campaign group , pointed to record employment – more than half a million higher than its pre-recession peak – and the falling numbers of people absent from the labour market , falling long - term unemployment , and falling number of workless households			2
he warned that the job is far from done , however , detailing new measures to take effect this @entity124 will be required to take steps to make themselves attractive to employers before they claim @entity127			0
changes include a requirement to prepare a cv , set up an email address and registering for the government ’s new jobs website before making a claim			1
there will also have be regular meetings with job centre advisers – weekly rather than fortnightly – for those claimants judged to need more regular monitoring .			2
