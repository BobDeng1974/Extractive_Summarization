@entity1 baby : @entity2 the fox has lived with @entity5 scientist @entity4 since she was a cub			1
she understands as many commands as a pet dog like any well - behaved pet , she understands words such as ' sit ' , ' stand up ' , ' lie down ' - and knows her own name			1
but @entity2 is no ordinary domesticated animal			1
she is an endearing and impeccably mannered fox who has been trained to live alongside humans			0
the woman responsible for her unlikely transformation is @entity4 , a 22 - year - old @entity5 scientist who adopted her and another fox called @entity19 from the @entity20 , which has studied how animals evolved from their feral ancestors to live alongside humans			1
she saw animals at the institute , which began taming foxes in the 1950s and now has more than 50 generations in its breeding programme , waggling their tails and clamouring for human attention in the same way as dogs and wondered if they could also be trained like them			1
both her subjects were tiny cubs when they came to her but quickly grew into a companion that @entity4 views as halfway between a cat and a dog			2
' i needed them to be young , because then i could use food motivation to train some basic commands , ' @entity4 , an experienced dog trainer , told @entity42			1
her first task was getting the animals to come close to her , a process she found easy			2
after this she moved on to basic commands , which took the foxes three weeks of 15 minute sessions to master			1
they soon began to recognise their own names and would come to her for affection			0
her work attracted international fascination			0
a @entity57 film crew recorded @entity4 's work with foxes and were amazed at her achievements			2
she has now written an essay on her experiences and hopes to continue exploring the ways that foxes can be trained			2
some of the foxes , like @entity2 , have been sold to curious animal lovers			2
others have been sold to fur farms because they are less distressed in captivity			0
she said : ' psychologically i understand them better now			0
tamed foxes are not quite like dogs , they are more in between dogs and cats in how they respond to humans			2
' the @entity79 farm is in @entity80 , the academic region of @entity82 's largest city , @entity83			0
it is unique in the world as it has several hundred tamed foxes			1
its groundbreaking work began in the 1950s , when @entity91 biologist @entity90 gathered foxes from fur farms and bred the friendliest and least ferocious animals			1
he wanted to test a theory by @entity96 that domestication physically changes animals			0
by the mid- 1960s , the foxes had gone from wild to not fearing humans to actively seeking to befriend them			0
his team started to notice not only behavioural changes such as wagging their tails and licking their human caretakers to show affection , but also physical changes , such as spotted coats , floppy ears , and curled tails			0
the effect has been dubbed the domestication phenotype			0
his research drew the ire of @entity116 politicians , who saw genetics as a western science , and he was lucky to be able to continue his work until his death in 1985 , when it was taken over by @entity4 â€™s mentor dr @entity122			0
she comes to humans for affection and is little different from any other pet experiment : @entity4 said that it was essential the foxes came to her when they were cubs so she could train them lie down : training the foxes to obey basic commands took 15 minutes a day for three weeks , shocking @entity4 at how quickly the animals learned			1

young @entity5 dog trainer teaches rare tame foxes to follow commands
foxes can ' sit ' , ' stay ' and ' lie down ' at her direction
the animals come from a unique *facility* that breeds domesticated foxes
