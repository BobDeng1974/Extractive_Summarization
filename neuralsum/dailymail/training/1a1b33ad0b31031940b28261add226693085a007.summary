by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:17 est , 2 may 2013 updated : 11:27 est , 2 may 2013 @entity2 is braced for heavy losses in today ’s local elections as the @entity5 battle to prevent voters deserting them for the @entity8 @entity7			1
the prime minister said backing the @entity10 was a ‘ vote to keep your @entity13 bill down ’ as polling stations opened in 34 councils in @entity16 and @entity17			1
but pollsters predict @entity7 could win up to 100 seats , and cost the @entity5 hundreds more after a campaign dominated by the rise in @entity24 ’s @entity23 party			1
the parties go into battle in 34 councils in tomorrow 's elections , with the @entity5 braced for big losses in areas last contested in 2009 when @entity31 was leading @entity32 to a major defeat			1
but all eyes will be on what impact @entity7 can make , and how many votes it can take from the bigger parties more than 10,000 candidates are contesting 2,500 seats in today 's elections			1
poll clerk @entity41 ( left ) and presiding officer @entity42 are pictured setting up their polling station at @entity44 in @entity45 , @entity46 a woman arrives at a polling station in @entity49 , @entity50 while a man turns out to vote at a temporary polling station in @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 in a last ditch bid to woo voters , mr @entity2 yesterday revealed he could rush forward legislation on staging a referendum on @entity8 ’s membership of the @entity61			1
the prime minister suggested @entity63 could vote on @entity64 before the general election , despite opposition from the @entity67			1
‘ ‘ i think we need to demonstrate absolutely that we are serious about this referendum , ’ he told the @entity68			0
the surprise announcement , which even caught conservative cabinet ministers off guard , was seen as an attempt to stop the @entity5 haemorrhaging votes to @entity7 today			1
but mr @entity24 dismissed it as ‘ another brittle pledge by @entity2 which we wo n’t be falling for ’			0
he added on @entity79 : ‘ @entity81 poll pledge just is n't believable : clearly another desperate attempt to stop the rise of @ @entity7			1
’ mr @entity2 also came under criticism from @entity10 mp @entity85			0
he told the @entity86 , mr @entity85 said : ' i do n't think people on the streets are clear enough about what @entity2 stands for - and that 's a problem in politics			0
' you need to have a clear sense of direction and that can not involve a lot of u-turns or nudge - nudge , wink - wink , which is effectively what our airports policy is			0
even critics respect leadership and decisiveness and i do think we are lacking in that up to a point			0
' @entity111 woes : @entity2 's @entity10 party and @entity113 's @entity67 are both braced for heavy losses in today 's elections @entity7 leader @entity24 took time out from campaigning yesterday to enjoy a pint of ale at a pub in @entity121 , @entity50 however , @entity7 has been battered by a string of embarrassing revelations about its record slate of 1,700 candidates			1
mr @entity24 was forced to admit his party had not properly vetted everyone standing on a @entity7 ticket after members were exposed for wearing a @entity131 mask , blaming the @entity132 on @entity133 and branding @entity134 an ' old w * * * * '			2
he defended @entity139 candidate @entity138 over an image which apparently showed him giving a @entity142 salute , insisting : ‘ i believe him when he says that he was angrily trying to take a camera off his girlfriend who was annoyingly taking pictures of him in the pub imitating a pot plant , ' he told @entity136			0
@entity149 candidate @entity148 , 19 , wore a mask of @entity151 paedophile @entity131 to a @entity152 last year and @entity153 , 46 , a candidate in @entity139 posted a photo mock - up on @entity155 of himself stood next to @entity156			0
today it emerged @entity158 , a @entity7 candidate in @entity159 , was forced to resign as a police officer after he was caught working as a male escort in full uniform			2
@entity7 candidate @entity153 was forced to defend mocking up a picture of himself standing next to @entity156 ( left ) while @entity138 denied making a @entity142 salute , insisting he was trying to grab the camera from his friend @entity7 candidate @entity148 was revealed to have worn a @entity131 mask to a @entity152 while today it emerged that @entity159 candidate @entity158 ( left ) forced to resign as a police officer after he was caught working as a male escort in full uniform during the campaign mr @entity24 was also forced to admit some of his policies need ‘ more work ’ amid claims it contains a £ 120billion blackhole in unfunded tax cuts and spending promises			2
however , the dire publicity has done little to dent @entity7 ’s standing in opinion polls			2
one @entity182 survey poll in the 34 areas where council elections are being held suggested @entity7 could secure 22 per cent of the vote , pushing the @entity67 into a humiliating fourth place			1
mr @entity24 insisted it was not his fault the @entity7 campaign bus had parked in a disabled parking space during a visit to @entity121 in @entity50 mr @entity24 pictured outside a pub in @entity121 has called for an end to the smoking ban in pubs rising popularity : @entity7 leader @entity24 believes he is on the verge of a major breakthrough and has seen many @entity10 supporters switch in favour of his party @entity67 leader @entity113 last night admitted his party faces a poor result			1
‘ you know , we have been beaten by @entity7 before in the polls , ’ the deputy prime minister told @entity204 last night			2
‘ what i am saying is that these things come and go in politics and i 've seen them in my time come and go			0
@entity7 beat us in 2009 ; a year later we won 24 per cent of the vote in the general election and @entity7 were nowhere			1
’ pressure is also mounting on @entity32 leader @entity215 , who has seen his lead in opinion polls narrow in recent weeks			1
the @entity5 have challenged @entity32 to win an extra 1,000 seats , although pollsters predict gains of 370 are more likely			2
@entity221 warned that the @entity5 could struggle in the local elections			0
the mayor of @entity224 said : ' it 's going to be a tough fight for my party in mid-term , that is inevitable			0
' obviously , for hard working @entity10 councillors who do lose their seats , i 'm sure they will be back			2
' the @entity10 leader focused on council tax bills in his polling day message on @entity79 @entity67 leader @entity113 hopes to make gains in the party 's traditional @entity239 stronghold mr @entity215 must prove that his @entity242 slogan can win votes outside @entity32 's northern base mr @entity24 used @entity79 to dismiss mr @entity2 's suggestion that he could bring forward legislation on an @entity61 referendum @entity224 mayor @entity221 , who today tried his hand at making a @entity250 chocolate souffle in @entity224 , warned the @entity5 face a ' tough fight ' in today 's elections mr @entity215 launched a back to basics campaign , touring the country and addressing crowds from a wooden pallet ' soap box ' in high streets and town centres			1
but he suffered a major setback when he repeatedly refused to admit during a @entity68 radio interview that his plan to cut vat would increase borrowing			0
he was asked 10 times on monday about the impact of his policies on the nation 's finances , but refused to answer			0
confronted on tuesday by claims his economic policies had descended into a ' @entity272 ' , he caved in and said : ' i am clear about this , a temporary cut in @entity275 , as we are proposing , would lead to a temporary rise in borrowing			0
' on the campaign trail yesterday mr @entity215 said he was ' certain we can overcome our country 's problems '			2
he added : ' the choice is between a @entity284 that knows we rebuild @entity8 by standing up for the many and a @entity10 - led government that only stands up for the few			2
' labour leader @entity215 launched a back to basics campaign , holding hustings in town centres including in @entity293 's @entity292 , @entity294 the @entity32 leader is under pressure to prove his @entity242 slogan can win votes outside @entity32 's northern heartlands @entity300 courted controversy when he urged tactical voters to back the @entity8 @entity7 in tomorrow ’s local elections			1
in an extraordinary intervention , the @entity10 grandee said @entity7 ’s policies were now those ‘ closest to a traditional conservative agenda ’			2
and he urged right - leaning voters in @entity32 areas to vote tactically for whichever candidate had the best chance of causing an upset – even if they are not @entity10			0
‘ if you have a @entity32 councillor then i suggest that the best vote is the one most likely to replace him or her with either a @entity10 , @entity7 or sound independent one , ' he said			1
@entity7 has been under sustained assault from the @entity5 , with @entity321 branding the party a ‘ collection of clowns ’ supported by ' racists '			0
and @entity10 sources believe the @entity23 party could do serious damage today with conservatives potentially forced to go into coalition with @entity7 councillors in once - safe @entity10 areas			1
but @entity300 said his party ’s tactics were counterproductive and accused senior @entity5 , including mr @entity321 , of waging a ‘ smear campaign ’ against @entity7 which could drive disaffected voters into the arms of the smaller party			0
mr @entity2 refused to be drawn into the row over @entity7 being branded ' clowns ' and ' racists '			0
' i ’m not calling anybody anything , what i ’m doing is talking about what the @entity10 offer at the local elections and in the end it ’s people who will go and vote and people who will choose , ' he said yesterday			0
he said he would not make predictions about the scale of @entity10 losses in tomorrow 's elections			0
' the conservatives are defending more seats than anyone else , we control more councils than anyone else , so everyone ’s having a shot at us			1

more than 2,400 seats up for grabs in 34 county and unitary councils in @entity16 and @entity17
conservatives braced to lose hundreds of seats with the @entity8 @entity7 predicting big wins
@entity113 suggests the @entity67 could be pushed into fourth in the popular vote
@entity215 under pressure to make gains in the south to prove he is on course to become *pm*
