@entity0 is recalling 250,000 suitcases , including some sold through @entity3 online stores , amid concerns about toxic chemicals			1
the move follows tests by a consumer group which found traces of a cancer - risk chemical in handles on the luxury bags			1
the recall relates to the @entity15 brand , which is part of the @entity19 @entity18 range			2
recall : @entity0 products are displayed at a store in @entity23 where the testing on the @entity15 suitcases that has led to the recall was carried out in @entity3 these cases are advertised by specialist online firms such as bagsdirect.com and luggagehut.co.uk , rather than high street outlets			1
@entity31 was selling a @entity15 expandable upright trolley case in black pearl print at £ 64.99 on its website yesterday			0
a spokesman for the firm said @entity0 generally dispatches these and other designs from a large warehouse in @entity39			2
@entity0 , a @entity19 company , pulled the line from @entity23 stores earlier this week to replace the side handles			1
concern : testing in @entity23 , a popular shopping destination , detected the high level of cancer linked compounds the move came after @entity23 ’s @entity49 reported that a sample it tested had levels of poly - cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that were higher than recommended in voluntary guidelines			1
the compounds are commonly found in plastics , rubber and lubricating oil and it is possible that traces were left during manufacturing , the council said			0
they have been known to cause cancer and birth defects in animals			0
the council ’s tests gave readings for the compounds that were off the charts at 17,960 milligrams per kilo			0
@entity0 commissioned independent tests from @entity71 and @entity23 laboratories that showed levels were ‘ significantly lower ’ than the council ’s findings			1
those tests found 17 milligrams per kilo of the compound , said @entity77 , @entity0 ’s @entity78 and @entity80 president			1
he said : ‘ a human being has to eat 100 handles and then you have the probability of one in a billion chance of getting cancer			0
’ the @entity15 suitcases are sold mainly in @entity89			0
@entity0 expects to spend £ 320,000 on the recall , which involves 250,000 suitcases sold over the past three years			1
the company said it will take about a week to replace the handles on 30,000 cases still in stock			0
in @entity23 , about 800 people have contacted the company about the suitcases and about 240 have asked for the handles on their bags to be replaced , mr @entity77 said			2
@entity0 said there are no legal guidelines for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons			2
the council used guidelines set under a voluntary @entity71 scheme for its tests			0
@entity3 consumers who own a @entity15 suitcase are being told that they should contact the retailer it came from for advice .			0
