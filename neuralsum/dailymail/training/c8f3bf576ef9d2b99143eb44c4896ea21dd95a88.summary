by @entity0 and @entity1 a woman who was sold for sex by her own mother has revealed how she suffered a decade of rape from the age of five by men who would pay just £ 5			1
as a young girl the 48 - year old from south @entity9 , who has chosen to remain anonymous , was subjected to sex with paedophiles , with her mother receiving money or alcohol in return			1
even after she was taken into care the abuse continued during weekend visits home and only stopped when @entity21 * ran away for good at the age of 15			1
speaking out : a woman ( left ) who was sold for sex by her own mother ( right ) has revealed how she suffered a decade of rape from the age of five she remained silent about the abuse for years but suffered a breakdown aged 41 after learning more about her mother ’s deplorable crime			1
it was only after her mother died that @entity21 felt brave enough to contact police and report what had happened			1
however , because her mother was dead no action could be taken and instead @entity21 decided to talk about her shocking experiences to help other abuse victims find a voice			1
hidden torment : ' @entity21 ' ( right ) , pictured with her mother as a teenager , remained silent about her abuse for years ' when i heard my mother had died i actually laughed , ' she said			1
' that might sound awful but words can not describe the hatred and fear i had for that woman after what she forced me to do			2
‘ i remained frightened of her my whole life			0
i regret not reporting her while she was still alive because there can be no greater act of evil for a mother than to sell the body of her own daughter			2
‘ but it was only when she died that i felt free			1
the police could n’t do anything of course but it felt like a weight had gone just to report it			1
‘ people think things like this do n’t happen on our streets but i ’m living proof and i want to use my story to save other children from a life like mine			0
’ @entity21 was just five years old when she remembers her mother taking her to a man for the first time			1
she had no idea of what was about to happen when her cruel mother ordered her to get dressed that day			2
' i remember mum taking me to a block of flats and her knocking the door , ' she said			0
' she spoke to the man and then pushed me inside the door			0
‘ i was so young i just did what i was told			0
i knew it felt wrong but i was scared and confused and after he gave me a lollipop			2
’ after their encounter , the man sent @entity21 back outside to her mother on the street and she started to cry			1
‘ i remember mum telling me to stop sniveling			0
there was no comfort or emotion from her at all			0
’ stolen innocence : @entity21 as a baby with her mother			1
just a few years later the older woman would arrange for her daughter to be raped in return for money or alcohol relief : @entity21 found out in 2011 that her mother had died , and says she felt ' a huge sense of relief that she had gone ' however , back at their council house it was just the beginning as men started calling round more frequently to abuse @entity21 and her sister @entity107 *			1
her mother would allow them to take @entity21 and @entity107 to a disused factory behind their house where they would be raped in exchange for payment			1
@entity21 said : ' @entity115 would just sneer at me after			1
i had no idea why she hated me so much			0
she barely fed us and made us sleep on the floor			0
i lived in fear of knocks at the door			0
' cruel : @entity21 was just five years old when she remembers her mother ( pictured ) taking her to a man for the first time aged seven she was taken into care and moved into a children ’s home			1
appallingly , while she was there she suffered even more abuse , but weekend visits home were even more terrifying			1
on one occasion while she was being raped her mother remained in the room with her , and even told her daughter to be quiet when she screamed			1
it was only a matter of time before one of the sisters fell pregnant , with @entity107 learning that she was expecting a baby at just 14			1
desperation : @entity21 aged 15 , just before she ran away from home in an attempt to escape her torment ' when my sister fell pregnant we knew the father must have been one of the men mum sold us too because neither of us had had any other relationships , ' @entity21 said			1
' despite that my sister wanted to keep the baby but mum forced her to give the child up for adoption			2
' @entity21 says she was so afraid that the same would eventually happen to her that when she was 15 she made the decision to run away , spending the first two weeks away from home sleeping rough in a public toilet			1
' it was awful but no where near as bad as what i had left behind , ' she said			0
eventually she was offered a place to stay by a taxi driver she befriended			0
the couple soon fell in love and married when @entity21 was 19			1
they went on to have six children together and @entity21 did her best to push the horrors of her childhood to the back of her mind and focus on being a good mother			1
' my children were my world , my everything , ' she explained			0
' having them made it harder to understand how mum could have treated us the way she did			0
' @entity21 refused to have anything to do with her mother , and came to suspect that her father was likely a punter who paid her mother for sex			1
she said : ' i had nobody at all			0
not having any parent was something i had to come to terms with			0
but my children gave me all the love i needed and i managed to move forward			2
' however , soon after she turned 40 , @entity21 ’s world was turned upside down when she was introduced to the niece her sister had been forced to give up all those years ago			1
she explained she had tracked down her biological father who had admitted paying her birth mother ’s mother for sex with her daughter			1
parent : @entity21 , pictured with one of her own children , suspects that her father was likely to have been a punter who paid her mother for sex shock : when she was 40 , @entity21 , pictured with one of her own children , was introduced to the niece her sister had been forced to give up all those years ago he had also revealed that @entity21 ’s mother was herself working as a prostitute and known to sell her daughters for just £ 5 a time			1
the sickening revelation brought the memories she had buried to the surface and shortly after @entity21 suffered a breakdown			2
she was admitted to hospital and spent months recovering			0
@entity21 said : ‘ the baby my sister had been forced to give up had been adopted by a wonderful loving family and that was the only good thing to come out of it all			1
motherhood : @entity21 and her husband went on to have six children together and @entity21 did her best to push the horrors of her childhood to the back of her mind and focus on being a good mother moving forward : @entity21 with her own daughter			1
she describes her children as the ; love and light of her life ' ‘ she was an incredible , beautiful , bright young woman thanks to the adoptive parents that had raised her so well but it was too painful to stay in touch with her			2
‘ i could n’t cope with any reminders of my past and neither could my sister			2
’ as she recovered , @entity21 moved home from hospital but her marriage crumbled under the strain			2
years had passed when she heard her estranged mother was gravely ill with heart problems			2
she said : ' my brothers had remained in contact with her and urged me to visit her before she died and because i needed answers i agreed to see her			2
' she was old and frail but i was still terrified of her			0
' exploited : now a mother herself , @entity21 says she can not forgive her own mother for what she did @entity21 asked her mother outright why she had forced her to have sex with men but the older woman just laughed at her			1
' i knew i was n’t going to get what i needed so i just walked out and that was the last time i ever saw her , ' said @entity21			2
months later in 2011 she heard her mother had died			1
' i started to laugh because i felt a huge sense of relief that she was gone			2
' it was then she decided to go to police			0
' i did n’t know if they could help me trace the men that had raped me but they said without mum it was impossible , ' she said			2
' they were very kind and sympathetic and i wished i had gone to them while she was still alive			0
she did attend her mother ’s funeral , but not to mourn			0
' i just needed to make sure she was really gone , ' she explains			0
' there is no way i could forgive her for what she did			0
she exploited me in the sickest way possible and i now realise she was not my mother			0
' my children are the love and light of my life and i can say with 100 per cent certainty i am nothing like her			0
' but she should have paid the price for her crimes			0
i ’m just sorry i did n’t find the strength to report her while she was still alive			0
' @entity21 now hopes to find peace by writing a book about her ordeal , which she hopes will help other victims find the courage to speak out			1
' i regretted not acting sooner and in time i decided to start writing about what i had been through			0
i hope reading my story will help other victims make their voice heard			0
' what she put us through was unspeakable			0
but it happened right here in out country and it saddens me to say it is probably happening to another child now			0
' victims need justice and i want my story to help other victims find that courage to go to the police			2
