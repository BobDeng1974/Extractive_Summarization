@entity1 ’s knowledge of @entity3 ’s most emotive derby has been gleaned by proxy			1
from the tales , glories and disappointments of the men by his side			1
from snatched clips on @entity12			1
the first manager of @entity16 ever to have gone seven months in the job without playing @entity18 , his inexperience has so far been tolerated			1
that wo n’t last if he notches up another landmark by becoming the first @entity23 manager ever to lose to a lower - league @entity25 outfit			1
a @entity28 semi-final at @entity29 offers no margin for error			1
by his own admission , @entity1 has been forced to bone up on the meaty side of his @entity3 induction through the anecdotes of his backroom lieutenants			1
@entity1 ( left ) poses with the @entity38 alongside @entity18 manager @entity39 ( right ) @entity1 wants the @entity40 to pass without trouble between @entity16 and @entity18 supporters ‘ i have @entity45 and @entity46 around me who have played in these games before , ’ said the former @entity44 coach			1
‘ i have heard about @entity45 ’ free - kick ( when @entity16 won 2 - 0 at @entity25 in 1994 ) and everything			1
the whole club is thinking and talking about it , so i have some idea what it is			2
‘ i have also watched a couple of games from before to get a little bit of feeling about the atmosphere			2
it is going to be a big day			2
’ it ’s hardly unheard of for an @entity40 managerial debutant to have no previous experience of the fixture on his cv			1
neither @entity66 or @entity67 had played for either @entity16 or @entity18			1
both won a domestic treble in their first seasons in charge			2
@entity72 had witnessed many @entity3 derbies , but found his inexperience of playing one no barrier to winning trophies			2
experience of playing in the fixture , then , is not essential			2
neither can anyone say for certain that it even matters			2
@entity1 ( left ) and @entity39 ( second left ) pose with @entity82 ( second right ) and @entity83 ( right ) ‘ it ’s very hard to say , ’ shrugged @entity1			1
‘ but i have experienced big matches before			2
i have fought for trophies before and it ’s the same problems you encounter going into them all			2
‘ i know how to cope with the pressure and that ’s the most important thing			2
’ predicting how a manager or player will fare in his first @entity40 game is largely pointless			1
@entity66 won his first derby 6 - 2			2
@entity97 icon @entity96 turned in a virtuoso display in a 2 - 1 @entity18 win at @entity23 , while @entity100 ’s debut in a 5 - 1 win is still regaled by @entity16 fans			1
none of that exalted trio had ever sampled the white - hot heat generated by the game before , but found their ignorance a form of bliss			2
@entity1 , nevertheless , will leave nothing to chance			1
the key to winning his first @entity40 game , he believes , could lie in his right - hand men @entity45 and @entity46			1
‘ that ’s vital , ’ conceded the @entity16 boss			1
‘ i am so happy to have staff who know @entity120 football			2
‘ that not only helps me in this situation , but through the whole season			2
‘ i did n’t know much about the other teams , the players and culture			0
‘ it ’s much easier to get it when you have other people next to you			0
’ @entity131 had @entity132 , of course			0
it did neither man much good in the end			0
@entity1 celebrates in front of @entity16 fans after victory over @entity142 last weekend in the @entity120 league the @entity144 was compared unflatteringly - unfairly - to @entity131 in his early months			1
they are more forgiving now , but no one is comparing to him to an @entity66 or @entity72 just yet and it may be some time before they do			0
sunday and his first @entity18 win would be a decent foundation			1
@entity45 and @entity46 are not his only points of reference			0
@entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 and the injured @entity159 have all sampled the fixture			0
@entity1 will make a point of speaking to them all			1
‘ we are a team , the staff and me and the players , ’ he continued			0
‘ i have spoken to them a lot , not only this week but all the time			0
‘ i think this game is going to be much louder than i am used to but that is why i am managing			0
you train out in the cold 50 per cent of the time because you are looking forward to these days			0
‘ i do n’t think it is going to be too emotional before the game , because you so concentrated on what you are going to do			0
‘ but hopefully if we have a good result it is easier to enjoy the feelings and the emotions			0
‘ football is not always fun when you play , but it is fun afterwards			0
everything you have seen and experienced you can then take it in and i think it will be a great experience			0
’ it ’s only fun after a victory , of course			0
even then , the prevailing , dominant emotion is relief			0
the fear of defeat has always trumped the joy of victory when @entity16 and @entity18 meet			1
@entity1 wants his team to consider the @entity197 shocks in @entity97 to make sure they avoid complacency for the @entity120 champions , there is an additional pressure borne of their tag as overwhelming favourites			1
they are expected to not only win but to win well			0
‘ it is something extra because it is a derby and you want to win the city , ’ @entity1 added			1
‘ it is a bigger match than a normal semi-final			1
‘ i understand the expectations and you all understand my expectations , as well			0
‘ but this is not the first time in my life there is an expectation to win			0
it is how you handle that which is the most important thing			0
’ discipline - on the field as much as off - will be key			0
in any given press conference , @entity1 will use the word ‘ energy ’ three or four times , sometimes more			1
his key message to his players is to ignore the negative , sometimes ugly and abrasive energy from the stands and the hype generated by the game and keep it for where it matters			0
in the coming days , @entity16 players will be urged to don blinkers and shut out the nonsense around them			1
leading by example , @entity1 said : ‘ i have n’t met anyone			1
i have been in @entity244 the whole week			0
but i know where i can go and where i should go			0
‘ i know the expectations and want to save my energy for sunday			1
you have to choose yourself where you go and what you do			0
‘ that ’s what i said to them the first day i met them			0
we talk about it all the time			0
‘ use your energy for something you can actually do something about			0

sunday *'s* @entity16 and @entity18 @entity40 tie is the first in nearly three years
they meet in the semi-final of the @entity38 at @entity29
@entity16 manager @entity1 calls for calm between both sets of fans
