by @entity0 published : 14:08 est , 13 december 2012 updated : 14:08 est , 13 december 2012 here ’s one cub reporter who could bear - ly contain herself as she watched a wildlife photographer at work			2
as @entity5 took pictures of a black bear family in @entity8 , in the @entity10 mid-west , he noticed one young bear watching him very closely			1
after about 45 minutes the bear decided to have a go as well and ambled over to the tripod			1
picture perfect : this bear decided it wanted to have a go at being a photographer for the day and seized the opportunity when it saw a man taking photos backing off , mr @entity5 used another camera on his shoulder to carry on taking pictures as the animal tried to focus his camera and make sure the scene was set			1
photographer mr @entity5 said : ‘ while photographing a black bear sow and her three spring cubs near @entity33 , @entity8 , i noticed a young bear watching me from the nearby trees			1
‘ after about 45 minutes , its curiosity could not be contained			2
as it approached my tripod - mounted camera , i began talking to her in a firm , but calm voice and began waving my arms to make me look bigger			2
‘ she was not deterred and continued to walk slowly toward me in a very unthreatening way			0
generally , black bears are quite shy and easily discouraged under circumstances like this			0
what 's this ? as the black bear approached the camera , photographer @entity5 backed off and took photos curious : mr @entity5 had tried to frighten the bear by taking to her and waving his arms but her curiosity got the better of her and she walked on undeterred focus : mr @entity5 captured the bear as it mimicked his earlier behaviour while he was setting up the shot ‘ i slowly backed away about ten feet and using another camera i had over my shoulder , i was able to capture it as it mimicked my earlier behaviour			1
i guess she just wanted to make sure i had set the shot up correctly			0
‘ the young bear abandoned her camera position only after she knocked the tripod over trying to adjust the direction of the lens			1
‘ fortunately , i was close enough to step forward and catch my very expensive camera and lens before they hit the ground			0
” mr @entity5 particularly likes bears and has photographed grizzlies in @entity80 , @entity81 in the @entity82 and @entity83 in @entity8			0
' i guess she just wanted to make sure i had set the shot up correctly ' said mr @entity87 the young bear abandoned her camera position only after she knocked over the tripod trying to adjust the direction of the lens he added : ‘ what has struck me most about the bears i have encountered is that they seem very intelligent and in spite of their awesome physical presence , quite gentle			1
‘ if an animal can have a sense of humour then the bear is not only at the top of the food chain but also the smile chain			0
‘ i did not see my bear friend again i hope the experience does not cause her to give up her photography career			0
she showed great promise , ’ he said .			0
