by @entity0 published : 04:11 est , 19 november 2012 updated : 08:05 est , 19 november 2012 @entity2 's emergency services have been heavily criticised for their lack of preparation during @entity5 as it emerged some of the city 's most vulnerable residents could not get through to 911 operators			1
emergency lines rang and rang without an answer and those lucky enough to get through were greeted by woefully unprepared operators , the @entity11 said today			1
others needing urgent help during and after the devastating storm were passed on to the city 's 311 non-emergency line , while dispatchers from the police , fire and ambulance services squabbled over which calls were more urgent			1
overwhelmed : devastation in the @entity29 area of @entity2 in the wake of @entity5			2
emergency services were woefully unprepared for the storm , it has been alleged @entity34 , 45 , said an elderly neighbour with cerebral palsy drowned when his @entity38 home filled up with flood water because it took hours to get through to emergency services			1
she said 72 - year - old @entity40 , who was a wheelchair user , had called @entity41 for help when he could n't get through to 911 himself			1
' the first hour or so , i got a busy signal			0
when [ i was ] finally able to get through to 911 , it would ring for three or four minutes , ' @entity41 told the paper			0
' one time , they sent [ me ] to a dispatcher who called me back and ended up being in the @entity49 [ at least a 40 minute drive away ]			0
' on another occasion , she was transferred to @entity53 , which coordinates ambulances , only to be told they do n't do rescues			0
@entity57 left : a pile of debris from damaged homes in @entity38 , where disabled @entity40 , 72 , drowned in his own home after emergency services failed to respond ' i told them my friend who 's disabled was stuck in his apartment , and i had n't spoken to him in hours			1
they said , ' we ca n't really help you because it 's not a medical emergency			2
' ' they obviously were n't trained for this kind of situation			0
they 're kind of reading from a script			0
' @entity40 had been logged in their system but his best hope of rescue was by calling 311			1
despite @entity41 trying both emergency lines until her phone battery died , responders were never dispatched and she found her friend dead the following morning			2
other people spoke of being criticised by overwhelmed emergency operators for not evacuating			1
@entity2 's 911 system typically handles 30,000 calls a day but during the storm on october 29 it received 20,000 calls an hour			2
the city 's 1,400 dispatchers were overwhelmed despite claims the 911 system could handle 50,000 calls an hour			1
under the @entity96 : the remains of the @entity29 boardwalk , which was destroyed by @entity5			0
emergency numbers received 20,000 calls and hour during the storm in 2009 , the city spent $ 2bn on upgrading the system , including a $ 680m call centre			2
earlier this year , a consultant found the city 's fire and police department 's reliance on having their own dispatchers created a situation where operators often ' wasted time asking duplicative questions and taking identical actions for the same 911 caller ' however , @entity118 spokesman @entity117 defended the set = up			1
' instead of holding on as instructed by a recording during these peaks , callers hung up and redialled even though the recording cautioned against doing so because it put repeat callers back at the bottom of the queue and furthered overall delays , ' he said			0
' despite repeated requests to the public to use 311 for non-emergencies , many still used 911 for non-life - threatening situations			0
' superstorm @entity5 made landfall on @entity137 's east coast at around 6.30pm on october 29 , causing 131 fatalities and an estimated $ 50bn of damage .			0

some of the city 's most vulnerable residents were unable to get through to overwhelmed 911 operators , while others were referred to non-emergency numbers , the @entity11 *reported*
disabled @entity40 , 72 , drowned in his @entity148 home after emergency services failed to reach him despite a friend calling for hours and hours
