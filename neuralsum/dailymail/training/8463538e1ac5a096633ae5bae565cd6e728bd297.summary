by @entity0 published : 18:30 est , 11 march 2014 updated : 06:08 est , 12 march 2014 living on the edge : @entity3 is going against the @entity5 tradition and serves her cheese before dessert for decades she has been hailed as the definitive guide to traditional food			1
but when it comes to the order in which it is eaten , @entity3 is rather less conventional			2
and shortly after she declared on her new @entity16 show @entity14 that she insists on following the @entity17 and serving her cheese before dessert , it quickly became apparent she had divided opinion between viewers and not all of them agreed			1
miss @entity3 announced on her monday night show : ‘ at my dinner parties i like to serve cheese after the main course because you still have red wine in the glass and it goes very well with the cheese			1
and that is what they do in @entity17 and i think they set a good example			2
’ and the queen of @entity36 added : ‘ i also like to bring my dinner party to a spectacular close by serving the dessert			2
’ one of the first to respond on social networking site @entity40 yesterday was @entity42 presenter @entity41 who said : ‘ it ’s the morning after @entity3 said she serves cheese before pudding			1
nothing will ever be quite the same again			0
disagreeing with the 78 - year - old host , another fan said : ‘ cheese before pudding ? is @entity3 mad ? ? ’ another added : ‘ serving cheese before pudding ? @entity54 she ’s a cheeky one			1
’ backing miss @entity3 and criticising the unrefined pallets of the @entity5 , celebrity chef @entity55 , said : ‘ it is a very continental way of dinning to eat the cheese before desert , and to be honest the @entity17 do have to right idea			1
‘ it is much more refined to finish with a sweet pallet because it is the way a meal should progress			0
often the wine served for previous courses can be enjoyed in the cheese course			0
‘ i think the @entity69 could learn something from the @entity71 and therefore conclude their meals properly , and enjoy their dessert			0
’ mr @entity55 , who runs an award - winning restaurant at the @entity76 in @entity77 said the tradition for the @entity5 to consume cheese last stems from the home grown art of port - making : ‘ it became very much a social thing to move away from the table and hack away at the stilton and crack open the port after pudding			2
‘ although we probably do n’t dish out the port as quickly today , the tradition of having cheese last has stuck			0
but if you go to any restaurant , which leans to the refines of continental dining you will always see the cheese trolley wheeled out before dessert			0
’ @entity98 and controversial : @entity3 said she prefers to served the cheese before the pudding as cheese often goes with the red wine still in the glass from the main course the cheese course is originally thought to have started in @entity106 and was later introduced by the @entity17 before dessert			1
according to experts serving cheese before dessert enables guests to pair the wine that accompanies the entrée with milder cheeses before moving on to blue cheeses which works well with the sweet and fortified wines that can them accompany dessert			1
another theory is that as the @entity17 traditionally serve salad with vinaigrette after the main the cheese acts as a ‘ neutraliser ’ to cleanse the palate before dessert is served			1
flying the flag for home traditions , @entity125 from the @entity126 , claimed the @entity69 choose to eat cheese last because it is more sociable			0
she said : ‘ @entity128 traditionally choose to serve their cheese last , it is often the natural move away from the sweet course and allows dinners to continue to enjoy the evenings wine			0
‘ traditionally the @entity17 would serve the cheese before , but for many @entity5 dinner parties it is often a social decision to serve after			2
‘ many hosts believe their dinner party will stay longer if they are grazing over a cheese board at the end of the meal			0
’ miss @entity3 , @entity144 studied at @entity146 school in @entity17 , before working in a number of cooking related jobs			1
she has published more than 70 cookery books and hosted several television series for the @entity16 and @entity151			0
the star is an occasional contributor to @entity154 and @entity155 and has been a judge on the @entity16 television programme @entity158 since its launch in 2010 .			0

@entity3 follows @entity17 tradition of serving cheese first
several viewers appear to disagree with the *culinary* queen
