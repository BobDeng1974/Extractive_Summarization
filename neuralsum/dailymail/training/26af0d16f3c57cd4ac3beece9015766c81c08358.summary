warning : pope @entity0 today warned that the @entity1 is being abused by selfish individuals to serve their own ends the @entity0 has warned that human rights have become a vehicle for individuals to pursue selfish demands			1
his attack was combined with a fresh appeal for tolerance of @entity10 and of @entity11 who object to equality laws			0
in a speech in the @entity14 to foreign ambassadors , pope @entity0 suggested human rights laws can lead to ‘ intolerance or even violence towards individuals , symbols of religious identity and religious institutions ’			1
the @entity0 ’s intervention comes at a time of deepening concern over the misuse of human rights laws in @entity27 , and as the @entity28 comes close to verdicts on four @entity27 test cases on @entity10 rights			1
the cases include @entity33 , a @entity35 check - in clerk who was refused the right to wear a cross with her uniform , and @entity39 , who was sacked as a registrar because she declined to conduct civil partnership ceremonies			0
the @entity0 has been heavily critical of gay rights in @entity27 and denounced @entity45 ’s plans for gay marriage in his @entity48 message			2
in his latest speech , the @entity0 said he was concerned that human rights laws were being used by selfish individuals to trample on those with opposing views			2
he said : ‘ sadly , especially in the @entity53 , one frequently encounters ambiguities about the meaning of human rights and their corresponding duties			2
‘ rights are often confused with exaggerated manifestations of the autonomy of the individual , who becomes self - referential and absorbed only in seeking to satisfy his or her own needs			0
‘ to be authentic , the defence of rights must instead consider human beings integrally , in their personal and communitarian dimensions			0
’ in an apparent reference to the @entity27 @entity70 adoption agencies that closed rather than follow equality laws that meant placing children with same - sex couples , the @entity0 added : ‘ believers , and @entity11 in particular , are prevented from contributing to the common good			0
the @entity0 , pictured attending an audience with the foreign ambassadors to the @entity14 at the @entity14 today , argued that the freedom of conscience and religion is being eroded by the @entity1 controversy : the popes words come just a week after it emerged that nearly 4,000 foreign criminals are using the @entity28 , pictured , to avoid deportation from the @entity27 ‘ outlawing individual and institutional conscientious objection in the name of liberty and pluralism opens the door to intolerance and forced uniformity			1
’ the @entity0 ’s remarks will inevitably be seen as another attack on the emergence of so - called ‘ sexual and reproductive rights ’ – including gay rights – at a time when some countries , including @entity27 , are seeking to redefine marriage to include same - sex couples			1
the @entity0 said @entity11 are being prevented from contributing to the ' common good ' because of human rights legislation but they will please critics of the way the @entity1 is being implemented following revelations last week that nearly 4,000 foreign criminals , including rapists and murderers , are using its provisions to avoid deportation			1
such abuses have added to the pressure on @entity45 to withdraw from the @entity114 , enshrined into @entity27 law by the @entity1 , but the prime minister ’s @entity117 partners are keen supporters of the @entity1			0
in his address , the @entity0 observed that such major existing , recognised rights as the right to life and the right to freedom of conscience and religion were being eroded as human rights were being redefined			1
he criticised the use of the false concept of human rights to ‘ expand legislation which decriminalises abortion ’ and to marginalise religion in social life , sometimes resulting in ‘ intolerance or even of violence towards individuals , symbols of religious identity and religious institutions ’			2
he said : ‘ in order effectively to safeguard the exercise of religious liberty it is essential to respect the right of conscientious objection			0
‘ this “ frontier ” of liberty touches upon principles of great importance of an ethical and religious character , rooted in the very dignity of the human person			0
‘ they are , as it were , the “ bearing walls ” of any society that wishes to be truly free and democratic			0
@entity0 used his address to also call for a halt to the ‘ endless slaughter ’ and ‘ dreadful suffering ’ in @entity161 , warning governments that without a ceasefire in the civil war the country would soon be reduced to ‘ nothing but a field of ruins ’			0
the @entity0 ’s remarks came in his annual address to foreign ambassadors to the @entity14 – including @entity172 , the @entity27 ambassador			1
