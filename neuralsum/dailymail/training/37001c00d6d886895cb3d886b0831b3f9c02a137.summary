by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:04 est , 16 july 2012 updated : 05:59 est , 17 july 2012 @entity2 and @entity3 rounded on critics of the @entity5 yesterday as they insisted it had achieved more in two years than majority conservative or @entity9 governments			1
pointing to radical reform of welfare and education , as well as the reduction of @entity16 's vast deficit by a quarter , the two leaders said they were ' more committed'to coalition now than they were in may 2010			1
seeking to draw a line under the government 's most turbulent period , following last week 's bitter row over reform of the @entity24 , the pair denied they were a ' warring couple '			1
for the first time since the creation of the @entity5 , @entity9 has overhauled the @entity39 as the party rated most competent and capable by voters , the survey by @entity36 found			1
the proportion who think of the conservatives as ‘ competent and capable ’ fell by 12 percentage points from 46 per cent in march to 34 per cent now , leaving them two behind @entity9 on 36 per cent ( down one point since march )			1
the @entity48 were on 24 per cent ( down six points )			1
on party unity , the @entity39 fell from 42 per cent in march to 28 per cent now , equal with the @entity48 ( down one point ) , with @entity9 unchanged on 46 per cent			2
they announced plans for a new , slimmed - down coalition agreement in the autumn			2
the prime minister dismissed @entity39 mps who have suggested the party would be better off governing as a minority administration without the @entity48 – insisting that with no @entity61 majority , it would not be able to carry legislation			2
he said : ' in a world of uncertain markets does anyone think we would be better off with a minority government that could n't carry its legislation , that could n't make rapid decisions ? ' i am even more committed to coalition government today than i was in may 2010 when @entity3 and i formed this government			2
it has real purpose , a real mission			2
' the prime minister added : ' my argument is actually we have taken on challenges that often single - party governments have found impossible , ' highlighting reforms to cut the cost of public sector pensions by 40 per cent despite fierce trade union opposition			2
' that 's something @entity9 did n't achieve in 13 years and the @entity39 did n't achieve in 17 years , ' he insisted			1
controversial tuition fee reforms , mr @entity2 said , were another example of the coalition taking bolder steps in two years than the previous @entity39 or @entity9 governments			0
working relationship : the prime minister dismissed @entity39 mps who have suggested the party would be better off governing as a minority administration without the @entity48 he suggested the @entity5 compared favourably with the administrations of @entity96 , @entity97 and even @entity98			0
mr @entity3 , for his part , poured scorn on those who were ' losing their nerve'almost half - way through the five - year @entity103			0
the deputy prime minister brushed aside last week 's turmoil over his plans to replace the @entity24 with a mainly elected second chamber – 91 @entity56 voted with @entity9 to wreck @entity72 legislation			1
' you always get a bump in the road like we did last week in the @entity114 village on @entity115 , ' he said			1
in a reference to his first appearance with mr @entity2 , in the garden of @entity120 , mr @entity3 added : ' it is tough to be in government in difficult times , it is not always a walk in the park or in the rose garden			0
none of that will stop us from continuing to govern in the national interest for the whole country			0
' we need to put short - term popularity to one side and get on with making the big long - term reforms and changes this country so desperately needs			0
' appearing together at a railway depot at @entity137 , near @entity138 , as the @entity139 met to announce a £ 9billion investment in the rail network , the two men announced plans for a mid-term review of the coalition to be published in the autumn			0
further announcements on infrastructure spending are due later this week , with the @entity148 expected to outline plans for the state to underwrite new housing developments tomorrow			1
a full - scale coalition agreement ' part two'which was once mooted , however , has been scaled back			0
harking back : in a reference to his first appearance with mr @entity2 , in the garden of @entity120 , pictured , mr @entity3 said ' it is tough to be in government in difficult times ' mr @entity2 said a ' slimmed down'document would ' look back at what we have achieved and what we have still left to do '			0
asked what the odds were of the @entity5 surviving until the 2015 election , mr @entity2 said : ' i am not a bookmaker , i am not a betting man , but i would n't bet against it			0
' mr @entity3 added : ' i would bet a considerable amount of money on us staying together			0
' @entity39 mp @entity174 , who resigned as a ministerial aide over @entity176 , said if the @entity48 went through with threats to kill off changes to @entity61 constituency boundaries unless conservative mps agreed to @entity115 , then mr @entity2 should pull out of the @entity5			0
but former @entity48 cabinet minister @entity181 , one of mr @entity3 's closest allies , said : ' it 's very , very , very unlikely that we 're going to see the two parties split before the end of their full five - year @entity103			1
