@entity0 hit back at @entity1 after he criticised the @entity4 @entity3 captain following their defeat at @entity7			1
the @entity4 captain was the subject of scrutiny on day one with his picks , and @entity1 joined the critics with a damning assessment , saying that @entity0 ' strayed from a winning formula ' used in 2008			1
but @entity0 said @entity1 's opinion on how he would manage a @entity3 team differed from his own			1
@entity1 ( centre ) looks despondent after @entity18 collect the @entity3 trophy @entity1 was clear and specific in his criticism of @entity4 @entity3 captain @entity0 on sunday @entity0 respondedby saying he and @entity1 had a difference of opinion @entity4 captain @entity0 shakes hands with @entity18 captain @entity25 the day after the event @entity27 highlights @entity1 did n't stay with the @entity4 team at @entity7 on sunday night after their 16½ - 11½ defeat			1
@entity0 told @entity30 : ' the issue between @entity1 and myself is basically a difference of opinion			2
' he has a difference of opinion where he would like to manage the team and i certainly had my own opinion on how i 'd manage the team			2
' that 's the controversy and that 's the issue but i have to say that i 'm very proud of my team 's efforts			0
one thing i asked them to do from the beginning was to give absolutely everything they have and they did			0
they just ran up against a buzz saw			0
@entity1 says the @entity4 should return to the tactics which helped @entity54 's team win in 2008 the @entity4 look glum as @entity18 stormed to victory at @entity7 with a confident set of singles matches @entity1 won his singles game but was deemed unfit by @entity0 for matches on saturday ' the @entity18 team was very strong and had four of the top five players in the world			1
when you play against them , you better be firing on all cylinders and frankly , we were n't so that 's it			0
' since their victory under captain @entity54 at @entity69 in 2008 , the @entity4 have failed to win any of the last three @entity70			1
@entity1 explained : ' there were two things that allowed us to play our best that @entity54 did			2
' first , he got everybody invested in the process			0
he got everybody invested in who they were going to play with , who the picks were going to be , who was going to be in their ' pod ' , when they would play , and they had a great leader for each pod			0
@entity0 was regarded as an autocratic captain and stuck , unsuccessfuly , to his guns through the weekend the @entity4 team stands for their national anthem after losing the @entity3 for the third successive time ' the other things that @entity25 did really well was he had a game plan for us - how we were going to go about doing this , how we were going to go about playing together , if so - and - so is playing well , if so - and - so is not playing well			1
' those two things helped us bring out our best golf			0
we use that same process in the @entity99 and we do really well			0
' unfortunately we have strayed from a winning formula for the last three @entity70 and we need to consider maybe getting back to that formula that helped us play our best			2
' @entity102 was a rare bright spot for a @entity4 team that was constantly outplayed by @entity18 @entity105 looks glum after the world no 2 lost all three of his matches at @entity7			1

the @entity4 lost *heavily* despite having the higher ranked players
@entity1 was *dropped* by @entity0 on saturday
@entity1 said @entity0 should have been more like the last @entity3 winning captain @entity54
@entity4 have lost three @entity70 in a *row* and last won away in 1993
*rookies* @entity102 , @entity117 and @entity118 offer some hope
