general admission for the bowling party cost $ 250 , but people could also pay $ 1,000 for a private reception			1

@entity1 signs books at one of the fundraisers @entity1 entertains voters at a fundraiser for his sister , who is running for @entity6 in @entity9 despite his affair , @entity57 , a @entity8 , is still considered the favorite to win the 1st @entity12 seat			1
the heavily @entity8 district gave president @entity78 only 40 percent of the vote in 2012 and more than a dozen @entity8 are vying for the seat			0

' is n’t that incredible ? ' @entity1 has jokingly flirted with runs for political office in the past and said he hoped that his stunts would n't ' sully ' her character			2
' i do n't actually have anything to offer people in a public office , ' he said			0
