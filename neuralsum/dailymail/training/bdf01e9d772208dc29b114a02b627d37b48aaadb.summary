by @entity0 for the @entity1 arriving at @entity3 laden with luggage , they look like any other tourists setting off on a fortnight ’s holiday to @entity8			1
in reality , the smiling @entity9 captured on @entity10 were heading to @entity12 to fight their so - called ‘ holy war ’			1
@entity14 , 25 , @entity15 , 31 , @entity16 , 25 , @entity17 , 19 , and @entity18 had booked cheap tickets on a @entity21 flight to the @entity8 resort of @entity23 on october 8			1
second left is @entity15 , far right is @entity14 different fates : @entity15 , 31 ( left ) returned weeks later and became the first @entity30 to be convicted over the current conflict in @entity12			1
former @entity33 worker @entity32 ( right ) was killed while fighting calling themselves the @entity35 , the fanatics , all from @entity37 , had been seduced by glamorous tales of martyrdom to join @entity40 – formerly @entity41 – establishing a @entity43 caliphate in the @entity44			1
today @entity14 , a shop assistant at @entity33 until he was sacked , is reportedly dead , killed in a gun battle last month			2
meanwhile , @entity15 , a one - time council official turned swindler who enjoyed using £ 200 - a - night prostitutes , is languishing in a @entity9 jail			2
he failed the selection process to join @entity41 and was thrown out of its training camp in disgrace			0
on his return , he was arrested and became the first @entity30 to be found guilty of travelling to @entity12 to fight in the civil war			1
the whereabouts of the other three are unclear , but they are still thought to be fighting with @entity57			0
a different kind of holiday : the group of men walking down a corridor of @entity3 as they left for @entity8 the ease with which they were able to slip over @entity8 ’s porous border with @entity12 has caused alarm in the @entity67 and prompted calls to @entity69 to make sure it is closed			1
up to 30 radicalised @entity9 a month are now travelling to @entity12 and @entity71 across the frontier – dubbed the @entity73 – that has become a gateway to @entity57			1
the number has increased markedly in the last ten weeks as the profile of the group has been raised by its well - run propaganda machine and catalogue of barbaric crimes			0
monitoring and electronic surveillance has shown that far from putting would - be recruits off , the beheadings and other atrocities are drawing more people to join @entity57			0
intelligence agencies fear the number of @entity9 and other @entity89 going to fight could increase further if @entity57 extremists succeed in securing a stretch of the @entity8 border with north - western @entity12 as a safe area through which recruits can safely travel			1
toll : at least one of the men who is reportedly pictured in the footage has since been killed , said his father disturbingly , a large force of extremists is reported to be moving towards the border in convoys of armoured trucks captured from @entity71 military forces			0
their goal is to provide a guaranteed gateway through which new fighters can pass safely			0
the 130 - mile frontier has so far been key to allowing recruits into @entity12 , as well as smuggled oil and weapons			1
much of the border area is difficult to patrol or to police , a mixture of rugged mountain passes and plains over which an estimated 800 to 1,000 @entity9 have travelled			0
it is also the route used by most of the 250 @entity9 whom officials say have returned to the @entity9			0
a @entity9 jihadist feared to be one of the militants behind @entity126 journalist @entity125 ’s killing boasted of how simple it was to sneak unseen into @entity12			1
@entity128 was asked by a reporter posing as a potential fighter whether he faced problems if he flew from @entity9 to @entity8 before illegally crossing the border			1
the jihadist replied : ‘ na , it ’s pretty easy			0
’ @entity57 ’s @entity9 recruits are told how to leave @entity9 – always travelling to @entity8 via two other countries to avoid suspicion			1
they are also told who to contact in @entity8 and which hotels and safe houses to use			2
some travel as tourists but many end up at @entity142 , ten miles from the border with @entity12			2
once safely in accommodation they make contact using a telephone number or email address			0
within 48 hours they are usually picked up by motorcycle or taxi and taken across the border to @entity57 training camps			0
unofficial operations are on - going to track the militants in the border area			0
intelligence services are monitoring @entity9 and other foreign fighters but @entity8 has been reluctant to stop anyone from crossing			2
for months it has allowed weapons and supplies destined for recognised @entity12 opposition groups to cross			2
@entity89 governments have been frustrated that little appears to have been done			0
dr @entity164 , an @entity71 expert on @entity57 , said : ‘ the @entity8 border is the only way to smuggle oil , weapons and foreign fighters in			2
' if it is closed , it will cut three things : funding , an entrance for the foreign fighters and links to @entity89 which they are trying to open			0
