alarmed by a rash of explosions and injuries caused when amateurs make hash oil , lawmakers in @entity1 and @entity2 are considering spelling out what 's allowed when it comes to making the concentrated marijuana at home			1
the proposals came after an increase in home fires and blasts linked to homemade hash oil			1
in @entity1 , at least 30 people were injured last year in 32 butane explosions involving hash oil — nearly three times the number reported throughout 2013 , according to officials with the @entity21 , a state - federal enforcement program			1
@entity2 's legal marijuana law in 2012 did not permit the production of hash or even edibles at home ; it technically remains a felony even to use weed purchased at a state - licensed store to make brownies			1
nevertheless , many people have done it			0
federal prosecutors in @entity42 have brought charges in five cases where hash oil operations blew up , including at one apartment complex where an 87 - year - old former mayor of @entity48 died after sustaining an injury while trying to escape a fire that started in another unit			2
people make hash oil at home for the same reasons they make beer , wine or booze — to save money , make it to personal taste , or as a hobby			1
though there are safer methods , such as soaking marijuana in a vegetable - based glycerin , one common practice is to force a solvent such as butane or propane gas or liquid through leafy cannabis , a process that separates its psychoactive material from buds , leaves and stems			0
after the extraction , the hash - maker then releases the gas or boils off the liquid , leaving behind marijuana 's psychoactive material in a potent goop			2
the resulting product — called hash oil or shatter or wax in even more concentrated form — can be used in vaporizers or added to foods without the grassy taste raw pot imparts			1
without proper ventilation , though , the gases can pool in a room , where a spark from an appliance can trigger a severe explosion , knocking buildings off their foundation in some cases			0
@entity2 lawmakers are proposing to allow limited home hash production , though butane or other explosive gases would be banned except for use by commercial producers			1
safer methods would be ok , and adults would be allowed to use cooking oil , butter or similar substances to make edibles			2
alarmed by a rash of explosions caused by amateur hash production , @entity1 and @entity2 lawmakers are considering limits on making the marijuana concentrate at home ' we have a little problem here with people blowing themselves up , ' said @entity2 sen. @entity120 , the @entity121 sponsor of that state 's measure			1
' anything we can do to stop that from happening			0
' in @entity1 , where hash regulations vary by jurisdiction , a bill up for its first vote next week in a @entity129 committee would establish a similar ban on the use of explosive gases to make hash			1
' people who make it at home , they can do so with alcohol or methods that are safe , ' said @entity1 state rep. @entity142 , a sponsor of the bill			1
@entity1 's largest jurisdiction , @entity145 , banned some types of home hash production late last year			1
a similar ban is under discussion in the state 's third - largest city , @entity152			0
but some marijuana activists argue that when pot is legal , concentrating it at home should be legal , too			0
they compare the hash explosions to fires caused by turkey fryers and call it a problem with a new product that is best addressed by consumer education			0
' sure , there have been numerous dangerous explosions and fires from idiots who are determined to blow themselves up participating in activities which need considerable safety precautions , ' said @entity169 of the @entity170			0
@entity169 insisted that butane extraction is perfectly safe with proper ventilation or when done outside			0
supporters of home production also say @entity1 's law is on their side			2
the state 's marijuana legalization measure specifically included concentrated marijuana and all its production methods			1
this photo released wednesday , may 21 , 2014 , by the @entity182 , shows debris following an explosion the night before in @entity185 , @entity2			2
when hundreds of butane canisters exploded just last month , the @entity145 district attorney dropped a case against a man facing felony charges of manufacturing marijuana concentrate and fourth - degree arson			0
the man , @entity193 , was charged last year after a hash oil explosion sent him and two other people to a hospital			2
@entity193 challenged the legality of @entity145 's hash oil ban , prompting @entity1 's former attorney general to say the marijuana amendment allows limits on home production			1
the charges were later dismissed after prosecutors said they could n't tie him to the explosion beyond a reasonable doubt , leaving the legality of the city 's hash oil ban unresolved			2
some marijuana advocates said a statewide ban would invite more legal challenges			0
' it 's a patient 's right to make their medicine , ' said @entity217 of the @entity218			0
but @entity1 lawmakers backing the homemade limits said the state should err on the side of caution			0
' this is something we need to nip in the bud , ' @entity142 said .			0
