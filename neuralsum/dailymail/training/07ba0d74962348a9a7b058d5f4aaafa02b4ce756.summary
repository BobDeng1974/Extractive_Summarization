the @entity1 federal government spent more than $ 5.3 million that it should n't have on food stamps and other nutrition assistance programs during the 2014 fiscal year , according to an inspection report published this month			1
the spending , called ' improper payments ' in government - speak , were totaled up through the end of august and accounted for 11 months of the fiscal year that concluded on september 30			2
the number is on pace to eclipse the total for 2013			0
the government defines ' improper payments ' as disbursements ' made to an ineligible recipient , a payment for an ineligible good or service , or a payment for goods or services not received			0
' most shocking in the november 7 audit was that more than one - fourth of the money spent by the @entity28 met that definition			1
the @entity1 @entity30 pays out billions unnecessarily each year in one of the world 's most sprawling food distribution schemes working poor : food stamp benefits are paid by the states through federal block grants , installing added layers of bureaucracy that sometimes invite financial shenanigans nearly all of the ' improper ' payments consisted of overpayments			1
a tiny proportion were underpayments			0
' but those get corrected , ' said a congressional legislative assistant who covers agriculture for a midwestern @entity49 @entity48 member			2
' there 's virtually no case where food vendors or truckers or dairymen just say , " okay , i 'll accept less			0
" those cases get sorted out , ' he told @entity58 on tuesday			0
' but almost none of the overpayments get refunded to the taxpayer , and that 's maddening			0
' the aide , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said that food stamps will likely always be a source of wasteful spending , and @entity69 is too afraid of voter backlash from low - income americans to tackle the problem			2
' they could triple the national debt on these programs and it would still be impossible to challenge them , ' he said			1
' it 's the third - rail of politics			0
touch it and you get zapped			0
' food - stamp benefit programs made $ 2.437 million in improper payments this year and serves more than 47 million @entity1 every month			1
another $ 1.748 billion was misspent by the @entity83 , amounting to more than one out of every seven dollars spent			1
ch - ch - changes : first lady @entity85 championed a school lunch requirement that lowered calories to just 850 and put other restrictions in place , and all schools that get federal assistance money are bound by it students in @entity93 have taken to social media to blast @entity85 for the resulting lunches , and they 're none too pleased that program provides free or reduced - cost lunches to more than 30 million children during the school day			1
but the @entity28 took the gold medal for wastefulness , with an ' improper ' payment rate of more than 25.61 per cent			2
that program spent $ 923 million it should n't have this year			1
another $ 206 million in misspent money was identified in the @entity106 nutrition program			1
the @entity107 , a free snack and lunch service for day care centers , issued $ 10 million in improper payments			2
the @entity112 reported tuesday that while the @entity30 's @entity113 oversees them all , it 's also asking @entity69 to fund a substantial increase in salaried employees to keep them running			0
the @entity113 employs 1,359 full - time permanent workers ; the @entity30 wants that total hiked to 1,600 in the coming year			0
most of the increase , 333 new positions , would go to the food stamp system , officially called the @entity120 .			1
