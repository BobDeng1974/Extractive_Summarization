by @entity1 reporter published : 10:34 est , 9 august 2012 updated : 12:17 est , 9 august 2012 footage has now emerged of the incredible morning raid on the @entity5 mansion of a man at the head of a suspected internet piracy website			1
helicopters , police dogs and more than 70 specially trained officers - some heavily armed with semi-automatic assault rifles - were involved in the land and air raid on the property of @entity18 boss @entity17 - also known as @entity17			1
the gates to the property are clearly open in the bottom centre of the picture armed raid : members of the @entity38 , armed with assault rifles , run toward the door of @entity17 's mansion near @entity42			1
inside are @entity17 and his family , some guests and staff - all unarmed simultaneous ground assault : as the first helicopter leaves , a police vehicle ( highlighted ) can already be seen on the property			1
@entity17 's lawyers have asked why helicopters were even necessary in the raid the operation , where police executed warrants to seize computer hard drives from the mansion , has since been ruled illegal by the @entity58			1
the footage , edited from in - flight helicopter cameras and @entity17 's own security cctv system , shows the sort of raid usually witnessed in over-the - top @entity65 films			1
aired on @entity5 's @entity68 programme , and re-broadcast on @entity69 , it shows members of @entity5 's @entity38 - armed with @entity72 assault rifles and @entity74 handguns - arriving in two helicopters at 6.47am , with dog squad officers and more armed authorities arriving in cars and vans almost immediately after			0
@entity72 : the @entity25 - made @entity81 assault rifle , which was carried by members of the raid as their ' primary ' weapon			0
specialist officers also carried a 17 - shot @entity74 handgun and extra ammunition evidence : @entity17 describes to the court the events of january 20 this year , while the picture above right shows armed officers on the roof of @entity17 's mansion as the raid unfolds inside the house are @entity17 , his pregnant wife , their three children and a number of guests and staff			1
there is no suggestion that any of them were armed			0
raid planners say the airborne force was necessary because @entity17 's property had security gates that prevented police from approaching with vehicles			1
their swift arrival was crucial , as @entity17 or a member of his staff could erase important evidence from hard drives on the property			0
but the gates to the property are clearly open as the first helicopter flies in , and multiple vehicles can be seen simultaneously closing in on the house			0
later an officer reveals over his radio that there are only two security staff members on the entire property			0
police response : arrows point to four separate police vans and vehicles on the @entity17 property less than 20 minutes after the first helicopter landed in the driveway officers from the second helicopter even run through the opened and unmanned gates			0
dotcom and his legal team also contest the authorities ' ' element of surprise ' justification , saying that the @entity24 had seized servers and had made it impossible for anyone to erase hard drives before the raid had even taken place			0
the footage shows what is generally known to have happened in the raid , but @entity17 's lawyers - both in @entity5 and the @entity25 - are concentrating on why the raid was so heavy handed			1
in particular , they have asked authotrites why - if @entity17 was deemed dangerous enough to warrant an airborne and armed raid - why participating officers were not wearing full armed response clothing and body armour			2
second wave : more heavily armed @entity38 officers arrive in a second helicopter , and are seen running through the gate that was supposed to prevent their entry in court footage also on the @entity168 clip , an unnamed and unidentified officer involved in the raid said the lack of full protective kit was a response to the ' low threat ' posed by @entity17 and his house guests			1
@entity17 was one of four men arrested during the operation			2
he is accused of being the ringleader of a group that netted $ 175million since 2005 by copying and distributing music , films and other copyrighted content without authorisation			0
@entity17 's lawyers say the company simply offered online storage			2
in june justice @entity186 ruled that the warrants used in the seizure of property from @entity17 's mansion near @entity42 were illegal			2
the judge also ruled that moves by the @entity24 to copy data from @entity17 's computer and take it offshore were unlawful			1
dogs and more guns : a member of the dog squad can be seen crossing the driveway to gain entry to the house , above left , while yet more armed officers arrive in unmarked police vehicles dotcom is on bail in @entity5 , fighting attempts by @entity25 authorities seeking to extradite him on charges of copyright theft and money laundering			2
before it was shut down in january , @entity18 was one of the world 's most popular websites , where millions of users stored data , either for free or by paying for premium service			0
authorities say @entity18 and related sites cheated copyright holders out of more than $ 500million			0
@entity25 lawyers for @entity18 have also argued that @entity25 federal authorities can not charge the company with criminal behaviour because it is @entity227 - based , and also that no papers have ever been formally served .			0

lawyers for @entity18 boss @entity17 ask why raid was so *excessive*
january operation ruled unlawful by @entity5 @entity58
' special forces ' *deployed* to contain @entity17 , his pregnant wife , their three children and house guests
