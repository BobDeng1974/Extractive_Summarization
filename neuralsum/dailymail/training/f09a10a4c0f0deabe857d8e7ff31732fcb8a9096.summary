from sexy lingerie to nail varnish , it seems any products can be linked to the upcoming @entity5 film			2
but now @entity6 has turned the erotic novel on its head by launching its ' @entity11 ' lingerie campaign			0
aimed at the more mature woman , the range is far from the leather and lace usually associated with the @entity17 books , and is all modeled by women over the age of 50			0
@entity6 have turned the erotic novel on its head by launching their ' @entity11 ' lingerie campaign the women hold signs proclaiming ' age is just a number ' , and ' we 're over @entity5 ' , while proudly showing off their figures in simple but elegant shapewear from the retailer			0
the campaign is in direct response to research showing that three out of five @entity33 women aged 50 plus feel underrepresented in the media			1
the mature market currently stands as the @entity33 ’s fastest growing fashion sector , which is now worth £ 6.7bn and is emerging as @entity33 ’s most powerful consumer group , yet it ’s widely ignored			1
the brand hopes that the images , which will be shown online , will promote body confidence for all women regardless of age , shape and size			0
modeled by women over the age of 50 and hair various ' shades of grey ' the campaign makes a tongue - in - cheeky connection with the upcoming film adaptation of the erotic novel research shows that three out of five @entity33 women aged 50 plus feel underrepresented in the media @entity6 spokesperson @entity55 said : ' we can expect to be bombarded with images of young women looking luscious in lingerie at this time of year , but what about the more mature woman ? ' interestingly , our research also discovered that 52 per cent of @entity33 women feel most confident over the age of 45 , so what better way to showcase that confidence by featuring mature models over 50 looking just as fantastic – and sexy – in lingerie as their younger counterparts ? ' age is just a number and i think our campaign proves that you can good in lingerie at any age ! '			1
