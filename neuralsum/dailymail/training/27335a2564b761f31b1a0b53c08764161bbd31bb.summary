@entity1 appeared to be offering an olive branch to the more doctrine - minded , conservative wings of the church today with a staunchly pro-life message during an audience on friday with @entity3 gynecologists			1

' even an unborn baby has the face of @entity27 ' : pope @entity1 denounced today 's ' throw - away culture ' that justifies disposing of lives but today he seemed a different man , telling gynecologists : ' every child that is n't born , but is unjustly condemned to be aborted , has the face of @entity27 , has the face of the @entity36			1
' the medical profession , he added , is a paradox because ' while we allow people new rights , we do not always protect life as a primary value and a basic right of every man			0

it must be one or the other			0
' what happens with money ? money gives you a certain sense of wellbeing initially , sure			2
but you feel increasingly important [ as it grows ] and then comes vanity			0
' pope @entity1 said he was resolved to reform the church which had a tendency to get caught up in ' small minded things ' describing money as ' a seduction that makes you to slide slowly into perdition ' , he added : ' money corrupts thought , it corrupts faith and it sends you down the wrong track			1
the path of money always ends in corruption			2
