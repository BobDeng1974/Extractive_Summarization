scientists have warned that the end might just be nigh for many species as they believe our planet is on track for the sixth mass extinction			1
the @entity7 has previously suffered five mass extinction events , the worst of which was 250million years ago when 96 per cent of marine species and 70 per cent of land species were wiped out			1
now they believe that the combination of climate change , destruction of natural habitats and movement of animals to new places is driving many species to extinction			1
scientists believe that the combination of climate change ( illustrated ) destruction of natural habitats and movement of animals to unnatural climate change is driving many species to extinction the mass extinction event 252 million years ago wiped out more than 96 per cent of marine species and 70 per cent of life on land - including the largest insects known to have inhabited the @entity7			1
now scientists think it occurred in just 60,000 years			0
multiple theories have aimed to explain the cause of what is known as the end - @entity43 extinction , including an asteroid impact , massive volcanic eruptions , or a cataclysmic cascade of environmental events			0
researchers at @entity49 have determined that the end - @entity43 extinction occurred over 60,000 years , give or take 48,000 years which they say is ' practically instantaneous , from a geologic perspective '			0
the leading theory among geologists and paleontologists has to do with widespread , long - lasting volcanic eruptions from the @entity56 , a region of @entity58 whose step - like hills are a result of repeated eruptions of magma			0
the new timeline adds weight to the theory that the extinction was triggered by massive volcanic eruptions from the @entity56 that released volatile chemicals , including carbon dioxide , into the atmosphere and oceans			0
the @entity72 ( @entity72 ) said in 2007 that 20 to 30 per cent of plant and animal species face a higher risk of extinction if the @entity7 continues to get hotter and now one science writer has explored what would happen if the extinction rate is accelerated			2
in her book @entity82 , @entity80 discusses modern - day extinction rates and told the @entity84 that it is not natural for humans to see anything go extinct in the course of their lifetime			1
the @entity91 writer said that the normal background rate of extinction is incredibly slow but nowadays naturalists are seeing animals become extinct – or teeter on the brink of extinction – all the time			0
she said that whether the present situation is a mass extinction , or ‘ just ’ an elevated extinction rate , is up for debate			1
ms @entity80 said that the changing chemistry of the oceans is possibly the largest factor on the slippery slope to mass extinction			1

the animals are threaded with extinction as their diet consists of seal , which they can only hunt from the ice in her book @entity82 , @entity80 discusses modern - day extinction rates a third of the carbon dioxide pumped into the air by humans is trapped in the oceans and when it dissolves it turns acidic , destabilising huge bodies of water and upsetting the animals that live in oceans			1
‘ when people try to reconstruct the history of the ocean , the best estimate is that what we 're doing to the oceans or have the potential to do is a magnitude of change that has n't been seen in 300 million years , ’ she said			2
‘ and changes of ocean chemistry are associated with some of the worst extinction crises in history			2
’ by looking at which creatures survived mass extinction events , scientists are trying to work out which species are likely to survive a sixth mass extinction , based on their characteristics			1
ms @entity80 said that experts have found species distributed widely tend to pull through , or groups that are made up of a lot of species			0
she believes that climate change is having a huge effect on different species , but based upon research in the @entity163 cloud forest , things move at different rates and some species can move up a mountain or to higher latitudes to stay within their temperature comfort zone , easier than others			1
one genus of @entity163 tree called @entity172 can keep with the fast rate of temperature change by moving swiftly up a mountain , but other plants can not move as fast , or at all , she said			0
science writer @entity80 said that the changing chemistry of the oceans is possibly the largest factor on the slippery slope to mass extinction			1
coral reefs most easily display ocean acidification ( pictured )			0
they become bleached and die as the result of increasing carbon dioxide levels scientists ’ best guess is that between 20 and 30 per cent of species area at risk of extinction if the average temperature of the planet rises by 2 ° c , but others believe the climate models are inaccurate			1
according to the book , scientists also think that the exchange of species – such as when @entity200 arrived in the @entity201 – leads to the extinction of species as the food chain is altered			2
in the age of cheap and plentiful global travel , the effect has been amplified			0
