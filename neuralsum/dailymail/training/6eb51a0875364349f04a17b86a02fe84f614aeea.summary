since arriving in @entity42 at the weekend , the president has been spotted playing golf twice already happy holidays ! president @entity3 took the first family to see a college basketball game on sunday , but the first lady , pictured yawning , @entity68 , with her head on her knee , and @entity38 , second from right , seemed less than impressed by the action the president also has been enjoying morning workouts at @entity42 in @entity74			1
on christmas eve , the @entity44 spent about 30 minutes speaking with children tracking the progress of @entity77 across the world with the @entity79			0

@entity4 president @entity3 ( 2nd - l ) first lady @entity22 ( @entity89 ) and their daughters @entity38 ( r ) and @entity68 ( 2nd - r ) disembark @entity91 at @entity92 in @entity87 , @entity42 , on december 20 , 2013 the president : hello everybody , and happy holidays			1
@entity96 : we know how busy this time of year is for everyone , so we ’re not going to take much of your time			0
but we did want to take a moment to wish you all a @entity6 , from our family to yours			0
the president : this is a season for millions of @entity4 to be together with family , to continue long - held holiday traditions , and to show our gratitude to those we love			1
and along the way , some of us might even watch a little basketball or eat some @entity6 cookies , too			0
@entity96 : here at the @entity29 , over the past few weeks , we ’ve had about 70,000 people from all across the country come visit us and look at our holiday decorations			0
this year ’s theme was ' gather around : stories of the season			0
' and in every room of the house , we tried to tell a story about who we are as @entity4 and how we celebrate the holidays together			1
and we made certain to highlight some of the most powerful stories we know – the stories of our outstanding troops , veterans , and military families and their service and sacrifice for our country			1
the president : our extraordinary men and women in uniform are serving so that the rest of us can enjoy the blessings we cherish during the holidays			2
but that means many of our troops are far from home and far from family			0
they ’re spending some extra time on the phone with their loved ones back home			0
or they ’re setting up video chats so they can watch as the presents are opened			0
so today , we want all of our troops to know that you ’re in our thoughts and prayers this holiday season			0
and here ’s the good news : for many of our troops and newest veterans , this might be the first time in years that they ’ve been with their families on @entity6			2
in fact , with the @entity160 war over and the transition in @entity162 , fewer of our men and women in uniform are deployed in harm ’s way than at any time in the last decade			0
@entity96 : and that ’s something we all can be thankful for			0
and with more and more of our troops back here at home , now it ’s our turn to serve – it ’s our turn to step up and show our gratitude for the military families who have given us so much			1
and that ’s why @entity177 and i started our @entity179 – to rally all @entity4 to support our military families in ways large and small			1
and again and again , we have been overwhelmed by the response we ’ve gotten as folks from across the country have found new ways to give back to these families through their schools , businesses , and houses of worship			2
the president : that ’s the same spirit of giving that connects all of us during the holidays			2
so many people all across the country are helping out at soup kitchens , buying gifts for children in need , or organizing food or clothing drives for their neighbors			2
for families like ours , that service is a chance to celebrate the birth of @entity209 and live out what he taught us – to love our neighbors as we would ourselves ; to feed the hungry and look after the sick ; to be our brother ’s keeper and our sister ’s keeper			1
and for all of us as @entity4 , regardless of our faith , those are values that can drive us to be better parents and friends , better neighbors and better citizens			1
@entity96 : so as we look to the @entity222 , let ’s pledge ourselves to living out those values by reaching out and lifting up those in our communities who could use a hand up			2
the president : so @entity6 , everyone			2
and from the two of us , as well as @entity38 , @entity68 , @entity230 , @entity231 … @entity96 : and @entity232 , the newest @entity3			0
the president : we wish you all a blessed and safe holiday season			0
