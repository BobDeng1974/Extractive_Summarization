by @entity0 published : 09:31 est , 31 january 2013 updated : 10:02 est , 31 january 2013 @entity1 - a 31 year - old from @entity2 was found guilty of sexually assaulting several young boys yesterday , @entity4 reported on the case of @entity1 - a 31 year - old from @entity2 who was found guilty of sexually assaulting several young boys			1
the mother - of - three got drunk at a party before kissing and groping a 12 - year - old on a bench in november 2011			1
she then performed a lap - dance and straddled a group of male children , before biting a 13 - year - old boy on his neck and coercing him to perform a sex act on her			1
she denied the charges , but was found guilty during a recent trial and faced several years in prison			0
however , in the latest blow for @entity24 justice and men ’s rights , she walked free from @entity27 @entity26 with only a suspended prison term and a smirk on her face			1
why ? surely it ca n’t be ... because she ’s a woman			1
addressing the court during sentencing , judge @entity33 incredulously stated that : ‘ although these were paedophile acts ... it was a one - off ... they were [ also ] acts of drunkenness , selfishness and childishness ’			1
he then claimed that sending her to jail would be wrong because her victims have ‘ largely recovered ’ from their traumatic experiences ... as if that makes a difference			1
shockingly , this is nothing new			0
in december last year , @entity51 - a 21 year - old woman and former @entity52 contestant - glassed her defenceless boyfriend in the face over a @entity56 post , but still enjoyed @entity57 in the comfort of her own home			1
two months previously , @entity60 from @entity61 was spared jail after getting pregnant by sexually assaulting a 15 year - old boy			1
following the ruling , the victim ’s father said : ‘ if it had been the other way around and this was a man having sex with a 15 - year - old girl , he would have been locked up , without a shadow of a doubt			1
but , because she is a woman , she has walked free			1
’ yet , ironically , a man like @entity75 - who ’s embroiled in a bitter divorce row with his wife - can be jailed for six months over a private matrimonial matter			1
it ’s a complete joke ... without being remotely funny			1
sadly , the issue is endemic			0
recent national statistics prove that 58 per cent of male offenders who entered a guilty plea were given a custodial sentence - compared with just 34 per cent of @entity24 women			1
out of the thirteen women ’s prisons in @entity87 , two are private - and the rest benefit from an additional set of ‘ gender specific standards ’ , which men ’s do n’t			1
and , in 2010 , judges were formally advised to go softer on female criminals , thanks to the ( ironically titled ) @entity96 - published by the @entity97			1
where is the equality in that ? not only does this offend , but it devalues the concept of justice - something which should run through the core of society evenly , like letters in a stick of rock			1
recent national statistics prove that 58 per cent of male offenders who entered a guilty plea were given a custodial sentence - compared with just 34 per cent of @entity24 women instead , our legal system is being manipulated by the outdated notion of chivalry - something which has no place in modern society , let alone a court of law			2
and i urge all men , including our dusty , out - of - touch judges , to reject it			2
why ? because it ’s the foundation of male gender bias			0
it teaches us to pick up the bill as well as the blame			0
worryingly , it teaches women to expect us to			0
yes , i understand it stems from a good place - from wanting to protect a woman from the harshness of the world , but sometimes women are the harshness of the world			2
this is the inconvenient truth			0
sadly , our legal system - which mostly consists of men - would rather be crippled by the romantic view of women than do what ’s right for everyone			2
it might go against our protective instinct , but anything else is political correctness gone mad - and unchallenged			2
yet , although it ’s men who are allowing women to escape justice , what i find most sinister about these cases - and @entity1 ’s in particular - is that there ’s no outrage from any of our country ’s high - profile , self - confessed feminists			1
why have n’t @entity158 or @entity159 expressed any outrage ? why is @entity161 - a @entity163 bigmouth - silent ? here we have a convicted child sex offender escaping jail , yet not one public feminist figure has spoken out			2
sadly , our legal system - which mostly consists of men - would rather be crippled by the romantic view of women than do what ’s right for everyone			2
it might go against our protective instinct , but anything else is political correctness gone mad - and unchallenged answers on a postcard , please			2
fortunately , others with more balanced views have voiced criticism			0
@entity182 human rights campaigner @entity182 told @entity4 : ‘ if this had been a 31 year - old man with young boys the sentence would have been much tougher			2
it seems a case of double standards			0
child sex abuse , regardless of whether it is perpetrated by men or women , is wrong and should be properly punished			0
’ @entity193 - who opened the world ’s first domestic violence shelter for women in 1971 , before exposing feminism ’s scope for hypocrisy in her work as a men ’s rights activist - agreed			2
‘ normal people - drunk or not - do not under any circumstances molest young children , ’ she told @entity4			0
‘ the fact that this woman insisted on pleading “ not guilty ” shows she has no remorse			0
in my opinion , jail was the only option			0
i cant help feeling that - had she been a man - she would have been incarcerated			0
’ and they ’re right			0
@entity213 ( like the law ) needs to be even - handed if it is to be credible			0
it must rage against women ’s unfair advantages as well as their disadvantages - both socially and legally			0
otherwise , the message they send out is this : treat women equally to men , except when they ’re treated better			0
anyone who disagrees is not only abusing the system - but our country ’s young boys , too .			0

judge stated @entity1 could walk free , saying ' although these were paedophile acts ... it was a one - off . .
adds the molestation was ' acts of drunkenness , selfishness and childishness '
