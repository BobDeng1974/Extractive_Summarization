spending cuts will have to last at least four more years , @entity0 suggested last night			1
the chancellor said this was a price worth paying to ensure economic stability and create private sector jobs			1
with coalition divisions on the economy widening , he suggested the squeeze on the public sector would last until 2019			1
spending cuts will have to last at least four more years , @entity0 suggested last night ‘ we are going to have to make savings – we are going to have to cut certain welfare bills like benefits that go to working - age people , ’ he told the @entity12			1
‘ but the prize is economic stability , growth , jobs in the future , brighter future , i think that ’s a price that works for our country			0
’ mr @entity0 ’s remarks came after days of what appeared to be a carefully choreographed coalition row over future plans on cutting the deficit			1
his @entity31 deputy , @entity30 , suggested yesterday that the @entity32 were in a ‘ pre-election panic ’			1
he claimed the chancellor and his colleagues wanted to inflict unnecessary pain because they were ‘ economically committed to shrinking the state ever further ’			2
mr @entity0 also came under fire from @entity39			1
@entity40 , a writer for @entity42 , an unofficial party supporters ’ website , and a visiting professor at @entity45 , said mr @entity0 ’s remarks were ‘ truly lamontable ’			2
this was a reference to @entity50 chancellor lord @entity49 ’s suggestion in 1991 that rising unemployment and the recession were a ‘ price worth paying ’ to get inflation down			2
prime minister @entity55 claimed the @entity31 were ' all over the place ' while chief secretary to the treasury @entity30 accused the @entity58 of wanting to ' inflict unnecessary pain on the people of @entity60 ' ‘ the @entity31 are all over the place , unable to decide whether they want to stick to the plan or veer off it			1
’ @entity55 ‘ we are going to have to make savings ... but the prize is economic stability , growth , jobs in the future , brighter future , i think that ’s a price that works for our country			0
’ @entity0 ‘ i just think the @entity32 are kidding themselves and seeking to kid voters if they are claiming that it is possible to balance the books , deliver unfunded tax cuts , shrink the state and support public services			1
’ @entity81 ‘ it is sad to see the @entity32 move away from the sensible , balanced approach of the coalition , to a policy that would inflict unnecessary pain on the people of @entity60			2
’ @entity30 while there are real differences between the coalition parties on the correct balance between tax rises and spending cuts , senior government figures believe the latest round of sniping is planned			1
the @entity31 and the @entity58 appear to have agreed to air their disagreements in public in the five months before the general election , even while exploring the viability of another pact			0
as well as energising their core supporters , the strategy crowds labour out of the main political argument			0
mr @entity0 said : ‘ there is a real choice for people between the competence offered by the conservatives and the chaos of the other parties			1
what they are offering is a chaotic alternative of higher taxes , higher borrowing and a return to economic chaos			0
@entity60 does n’t want to come back to square one			2
‘ we are offering a competent government with a clear plan that involves difficult decisions on spending and on welfare , and making the rich pay more through their tax avoidance schemes being closed down			0
and that is delivering economic security			0
‘ the alternative is economic chaos and people who are simply not being straight with the public about what their plan involves			0
’ the chancellor gave his strongest hint yet that a pay squeeze in the public sector will have to go on for another four years , to limit the number of job losses			1
‘ what i would say is we can reduce the number that need to go if we take difficult decisions on public sector pay , ’ he said			1
‘ this country has to live within its means			0
we have to have a government we can afford			2
’ mr @entity30 insisted there were big differences between conservatives and @entity31			1
he said : ‘ what we are doing is something that should be totally unsurprising , which is two political parties – with very different ideologies – setting out their views about the future of this country in a clear and distinct way			0
’ a @entity39 spokesman said mr @entity0 had broken his promises on the economy and failed to deliver rising living standards			2
a small number of conservative mps , including right - wing backbencher @entity165 , have suggested mr @entity55 should break up the coalition and govern alone as leader of a minority administration			0
a larger group would opt for the coalition to end if the @entity58 were able to call an immediate general election			0
conservative mp @entity172 told @entity173 : ‘ it ’s almost certain that there will be a coalition government next time			0
a coalition of who , is the question			0
’ she said the likeliest result was a @entity50 majority not big enough to govern alone .			0

@entity0 said the squeeze on the public sector would last until 2019
chancellor *warned* the @entity60 has to have a ' government we can afford '
@entity30 suggested the conservatives were in ' pre-election panic '
