@entity0 are ready to make a £ 20million january move for @entity3 international @entity2 , even though his selling club @entity4 are determined not to let him depart this winter			1
the defensive midfielder , who is currently on loan at @entity8 , is high on @entity0 ’s list to shore up their midfield			1
sunday 's fixture against @entity12 at @entity13 , which they lost 5 - 1 last season , is an uncomfortable reminder of the defensive deficiencies of the team			1
a two - season loan to @entity8 was agreed with @entity4 in 2013 and so stunning has his progress been that @entity2 not only made the @entity34 @entity33 squad but started the final , although he had to go off after 31 minutes with concussion			1
having spent two years on loan at @entity37 , the 23 - year - old has yet to make a first - team appearance for his parent club			1
@entity4 will not sell for less than £ 25m and want him back in the summer			1
@entity42 is also a target but it is just as difficult to prise him from @entity4 , having signed a new contract last season			1
@entity48 ’s @entity47 is also being monitored , although the club show little inclination to sell during january			1
the @entity51 have been impressed by the performances of @entity53 ( left ) and @entity42 ( right ) @entity54 , @entity56 ’s @entity3 international , is another holding midfielder who has impressed @entity0 but @entity22 would want to be sure the player has fully recovered after he spent most of last year out with injury			1
nevertheless , @entity0 are ready to inquire about @entity2 , with @entity22 insisting he is ready to spend in january and that the widely - held view of him as a frugal manager is misconceived			1
‘ if we find the right player we will do it , ’ said @entity22			2
‘ i said that many times , without any doubt			2
i ’m not scared to spend money and if you go out with me at night , you will understand			2
‘ i do n’t like to spend your money but i like to spend my money			2
' there were periods where we did n’t have the money			0
what i do n’t like is to spend the money i do n’t have			0
' what i did fight against was to spend money that would put the future of the club in danger			0
’ @entity22 is also searching for a centre half , although the club ideally want a younger player who can develop , rather than a multi-million pound star			0
although @entity85 is already providing back - up in central defence , @entity0 have concluded that they need a fourth central defender , with @entity89 having struggled with injury this season			1
@entity85 ( left ) has impressed while @entity93 wonder kid @entity92 ( right ) is a target @entity93 teenage star @entity92 , who spent part of last week training at the club , is a possible signing although @entity98 are confident that he will choose them			0
@entity92 is now training at @entity100 , with @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity12 also interested in signing him			0
much will depend on which club his father , former player and current coach @entity105 , decides will be best for his son ’s development			0
@entity92 is an attacking midfield , however , and defence is the area in which @entity0 will look to improve in january			1
shortly after last season ’s thrashing at @entity12 , they fell 3 - 0 down inside 17 minutes to @entity118 in a game they lost 6 - 0			2
going 3 - 0 down to @entity121 in the first half two weeks ago is an indication that the tactical and defensive problems are far from resolved			2
@entity22 believes the @entity51 are starting to show signs of improvement @entity0 midfielder @entity127 ( left ) could be fit to start against @entity12 on sunday ‘ i think we are getting better , ’ said @entity22			1
‘ we have to show that in the final part of the season			0
we go now in the @entity21 , we need to win games			0
‘ after that we have the @entity133 , the @entity134			0
without defensive solidity you have no future			0
‘ the defeat at @entity121 was significant because we got a big disappointment and we got a lot of criticism and i think we responded well , because we scored eight goals in the next two games			0
‘ it shows two things : first that the group is healthy because it can respond and has a unity			0
‘ and also , even in the game against @entity121 when you look again , we were poor defending but going forward we were not disastrous at all			0
