vacuum cleaners , fireworks and trips to the vet are all things dogs are known to be scared of , but this border collie is petrified of more or less everything			1
@entity8 cowers under a table whenever he hears doorbells or phones ringing and even the ping of a microwave can cause him to scarper			1
the hapless hound also runs scared at the sound of people sneezing and cutlery scraping against plates , making it difficult to find a quiet enough home for the petrified pup			1
@entity8 wears a special jacket designed to feel like he is constantly being cuddled but he still has to be moved around the building so he can be in the quietest spots			1
his old owners , who took him in when he was a puppy , had to give him back because his anxiety was too much for them to cope with			2
@entity49 , the charity 's rehoming centre manager , said dogs usually become acclimatised to everyday sounds over time			0
but @entity8 is unable to adapt to the sort of background noises we barely notice and each time he hears one he becomes distressed			0
he is currently spending time with an animal behaviour specialist who is trying to help him conquer his fears			0
despite @entity8 's skittish tendencies , ms @entity49 says @entity8 is a warm , affectionate dog and perfect for rehoming			1
she said : ' poor @entity8 is quite nervous and lots of things are scary for him			0
' we are looking for a quiet and understanding home with new owners who will learn to help him cope with his phobias and enjoy life			0
' due to his wariness , it may take a few visits for @entity8 to bond with his new owners so they will need to be patient			2
' he does like smaller dogs , but would prefer to be the only dog in the home as he does like his own quiet space ' .			0
