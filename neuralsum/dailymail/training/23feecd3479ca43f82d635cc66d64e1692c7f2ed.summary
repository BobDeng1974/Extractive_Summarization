a cinema asked a disabled man to leave half way through a film and told him not to return on busy weekends because other customers found his life - saving ventilator too noisy			1
@entity7 was watching @entity8 with his carer at the @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , when an employee approached the pair to ask them to leave 40 minutes into the film			1
the 31 - year - old , whose duchenne muscular dystrophy confines him to an electric wheelchair , was then told not to return on saturday nights by the member of staff			1
@entity7 was thrown out of a cinema after viewers complained his ventilator was too loud			1
the 31 - year - old ( pictured with his father , @entity27 ) has @entity29 muscular dystrophy it came after six of the 200 people watching the film complained that mr @entity7 's ventilator was making too much noise			1
the incident was described as ' disgusting ' by mr @entity7 's father who added the sound of his son 's ventilator is no louder than that of rustling crisp packets and crunching popcorn			1
' when we are at home we can watch a tv programme with it on , if he was texting or answering phone calls during the film i could understand it but he ca n't do any of those things because he does n't have the physical strength to do them , ' @entity44 said			0
' @entity7 has been going to the cinema since it opened and , in the last four years , has required the use of the ventilator to keep his carbon dioxide levels down which can be life - threatening if they are raised too high			2
' all he wanted to do was go out and watch a film and it takes a lot of organisation to arrange for @entity7 to go out			2
' i find it disgusting that , in this age , a person who is mentally capable - @entity7 has 14 gcses and a degree - but relies on life - saving equipment , should be treated in this way			2
' this is total discrimination			0
@entity10 does nâ€™t take disability seriously enough			0
' while mr @entity7 's ventilator makes some noise , it is no worse than the sound of rustling crisp packets of crunching popcorn , his father said the @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , where mr @entity7 was asked to leave			1
a spokesman for the cinema chain has since apologised for the incident outraged , mr @entity7 visited the cinema to complain but was told by the general manager that the right decision had been made			0
disabled rights campaigners described mr @entity7 's treatment as ' rude ' and ' discriminatory ' , adding that those bothered by the sound of the ventilator could have moved seats			1
' due to his duchenne muscular dystrophy , he often needs a ventilator to breathe , ' said @entity95 for the @entity96			1
' if the noise unfortunately disturbed other customers , then you would hope they would make the compassionate choice to move seats			0
' @entity7 , on the other hand , has no choice but to use his ventilator to breathe			0
' to remove @entity7 from the cinema and imply he can only come at certain , less popular times because of his disability , was insensitive and discriminatory			0
' to talk to his carer instead of him directly was also extremely rude			0
' a spokesman for @entity10 said : ' we sincerely apologise for the way this matter was handled and for the upset it caused			0
' we are inviting mr @entity7 and his son to return and enjoy @entity8 at any time as guests of @entity11			2
' we are also looking again at what happened to ensure it never happens again			0
