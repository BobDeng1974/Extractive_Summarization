@entity2 's ancient order of soldiers , the @entity0 , have been drafted in to help with security in the @entity5 in @entity6 , only a week before they begin			1
hundreds of the soldiers , wearing their traditional jackets and fur hats , are now marching the streets of @entity6 as the games approach			1
the arrival of the soldiers has coincided with a recent warning by @entity17 anti-terror chiefs that a large scale terror attack on the @entity19 is ' very likely to occur '			1
@entity6 will host the @entity19 in just over a week around 1,000 cossacks have been stationed at @entity6 to beef up the security , which has been at risk due to recent threats by suspected terrorists the @entity2 soldiers ' ancestry dates back thousands of years , with their most well known trait in western culture being their gravity - defying dance			1
in their home country , they are more synonymous with rebellion and strong military force , with this reputation being enhanced by the literature of @entity2 novelists @entity47 and @entity48			2
however , their military might may be used in action against the threat assessment made by @entity53 officials that a @entity55 group , @entity56 ( @entity57 ) are likely to carry out an attack after months of continued threats against the games			2
@entity2 cossacks @entity61 ( right ) , 19 , and @entity63 ( left ) , 13 , juggle swords in the town of @entity66 , on the outskirts of the southern @entity2 city of @entity69 the assessment points out that in july 2013 , the leader of the group , emir @entity71 , called on his followers to do what they can to disrupt the games			0
however , the report questioned the groups ability to schedule and carry out an attack with such a short time until the games			0
this warning came after both a twin bomb attacks on the city of @entity69 in december that killed 34 people , and the hunt for a suspected suicide bomber , @entity84 , who is thought to be part of a larger terrorist group of female suicide bombers called the ' black widows ' , named because they are the widows of militants			0
in addition to the @entity0 's installation , @entity17 intelligence says that 37,000 soldiers and police have been drafted in to boost security in @entity6 , and that they are forming a ' ring of steel ' perimeter around the event , making it a much harder target for attacks			1
the warning by @entity102 came after the bombing of @entity69 , which killed 34 people last year a photo of a police leaflet seen in a @entity6 hotel on tuesday , jan. 21 , 2014 , shows @entity84 , one of the ' black widow ' terrorism group , and states that she is at large in the city of @entity6 governor @entity110 of @entity2 's @entity112 region , where @entity6 is located said to local police : ' what you can not do , a cossack can			1
' these comments caused outcry from natives of @entity6 , as well as minorities and migrants , with analysts saying it is no coincidence that nationalism and xenophobia are on the rise at the same time the @entity0 are being revived			2
the new role of the @entity0 as hired enforcers may ' naturally translate into conflicts between the indigenous population of the @entity55 and the @entity0 ' according to @entity131 , an analyst with the @entity133 , writing in the @entity134			0
then : cossacks show their historical dance in older times			0
they have been known as a formidable force in @entity2 for thousands of years now : modern @entity2 cossacks stand guard near the @entity142 in @entity143 near @entity6 @entity2 , 1917 , @entity144 , grand - duke @entity145 , brother of @entity148 , in cossack uniform the @entity0 have long been known for rebelling against @entity2 's feudal system , allying with @entity2 's tsars to help create the @entity152 , with their warrior skills aiding @entity2 to conquer large parts of the country			1
over time they eventually got a reputation as the tsar 's henchmen , before the @entity2 empire realised they were not able to fully control them			0
the tsars and @entity0 found themselves united during the rise of the @entity163 in the early 20th century , and when the @entity163 ( later communists ) came to power they massacred many cossacks because of their opposition to the revolution			0
following the fall of the @entity170 , there has been a revival of @entity0 culture , with the @entity152 turning more and more to the @entity0 as a bolster to security during nationwide events , including the forthcoming @entity5 .			0

around 1,000 cossacks have been sent to @entity6 to beef up security
the soldiers have been known as formidable soldiers for centuries
their new placement follows terrorism warnings by @entity102
they form part of ' ring of steel ' security plan around the @entity191
cossacks add to the 37,000 police and military security already in place
recent fears of terrorism have led to more personnel and *tighter* security
