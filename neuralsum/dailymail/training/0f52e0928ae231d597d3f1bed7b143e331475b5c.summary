by @entity0 published : 03:42 est , 23 august 2013 updated : 13:10 est , 23 august 2013 here 's more bad news for people with a sweet tooth			0
not only can excess sugar intake led to health problems and obesity , it can also make you look old too			0
a diet high in sugar can damage the skin leaving it more prone to wrinkles and dryness			1
nutritionist @entity14 and dermatologist dr @entity16 explain why in their new book , the @entity19			1
they write : ' so , do people who eat too much sugar really look older ? the answer is a resounding @entity24 ! in a large study published in the journal @entity28 , 602 people were examined by independent evaluators			0
moment on the lips , lifetime on the face : too much sugar can prematurely age your skin ' healthy people with lower blood sugars typically looked a year younger than did those with higher blood sugars , and a year and a half younger than did diabetics of the same age			1
' they explain : ' too much sugar also has another negative effect on skin : simply put , it makes skin unhealthy			2
skin is our largest organ ; one of its main functions , called barrier function , is to protect us from environmental insults such as pollution , dirt , bacteria , and fungi			2
' anything that disrupts the epidermal barrier leaves us more vulnerable to skin irritation and infections			2
some very interesting recent studies have shown that long - term hyperglycemia ( too much sugar in the blood ) leaves skin more vulnerable			2
' this explains why diabetics and others with long - standing hyperglycemia so often suffer with dry skin			2
this is why controlling your blood sugar is so important if you want healthy skin			2
' pamper and protect : nutritionist @entity14 , left , and dermatologist dr @entity16 have developed a diet plan and skincare regime to help people look younger the pair explain how the skin begins to produce less collagen as we age , making it wrinkly and saggy , and poor nutrition can accelerate this process			1
but they believe sugar junkies still have time to turn back the clock by following their detox plan			1
as previously reported in the @entity98 , the plan begins with a strict three day diet of no sugar			0
on the low carb plan , dairy , fruit ( with the exception of lemon and lime ) , starches , wheat and any added sugars are all banned			0
some of these foods are then gradually reintroduced as the plan progresses			2
the pair say going ' cold turkey ' for three days is the best way for people to start on the path of a life low in sugar			0
the foods they recommend are all beneficial for the body - and especially for the skin			1
for example , they suggest snacking on nuts because they are high in protein and other vitamins and minerals that help repair tissues in the body and boost collagen production			1
turn back the clock : swap coffee with added sugar for green tea process in a blender : apply a thin layer of the mixture to your face , leave on for ten minutes then wash off with warm @entity142 it works : the yogurt contains exfoliating lactic acid , oatmeal is a natural anti-inflammatory , honey has healing properties and acts as a natural moisturizer , and the blueberries contain powerful antioxidants			1
at meal times they recommend regularly consuming fish high in @entity157 such as salmon			0
this is because they contain essential fatty acids that are ' the building blocks for the natural moisturisers in your skin and help keep skin hydrated			0
' when it comes to drinks , their superhero product for the skin is green tea - which can also be used as an extract in moisturisers			0
they also recommend using green tea bags as a compress on the eyes to reduce under eye bags and puffiness			0
they explain why it 's so good for helping the skin look more youthful : ' studies have confirmed that ingestion of green tea extract effectively blocks collagen cross-linking and inhibits age accumulation associated with ageing			1
' @entity189 can also be prepared as an extract for use in cosmeceutical skin care			0
topical green tea extract protects against uv - induced inflammation and oxidative stress , making it a powerful , topical skin care agent			0
using skin - care products containing @entity198 is an excellent way to inhibit collagen glycation and protect skin from damaging uv rays			1
' read all about it : the @entity19 is available to buy as an ebook as they are aware many will find the three day detox difficult , the book also includes @entity210 beauty treatments you can do at home over the three days to boost your mood and rejuvenate your skin			1
their spa treatments include a sea mud mask , an ' ancient beauty bath ' , i.e. one where you soak in bathing salts , and a ' moisturising antioxidant mask '			1
this can either be bought in the shops ( they provide a list of recommended products ) or made yourself using their recipe ( see pink box above , right )			0
the aim of the treatments is to make people feel better with some pampering as they detox but also give their skin a head start on recovery before the benefits of the new diet kick in			1
beyond the three day pampering , the pair outline a skincare regime that people should follow in tandem with their diet plan to look and feel good on the inside and out			0
they guarantee people who follow their advice will notice a difference in the appearance of their skin which will look younger and healthier			0
what could be sweeter than that ? the @entity19 : lose weight , @entity252 is published by @entity253 , ebook Â£ 6.49			1
