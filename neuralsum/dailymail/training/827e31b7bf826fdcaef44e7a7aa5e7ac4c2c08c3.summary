by @entity0 published : 20:36 est , 2 october 2013 updated : 15:44 est , 3 october 2013 @entity1 can triple the risk of developing @entity3 , according to researchers			0
scientists in @entity6 studied the medical records of 4,634 people with depression and 18,544 depression - free individuals for 10 years			1
during the follow - up , 1.42 per cent of depression sufferers were diagnosed with @entity3 's compared with 0.52 per cent of non-depressed participants			2
scientists in @entity6 found people with depression were 3.24 times more likely to develop @entity3 's people with depression were 3.24 times more likely to develop the disease than those without the mental health problem , said the researchers writing online in the journal @entity22			1
however , scientists do not know whether depression is an early symptom of the neurodegenerative disease or a cause			0
@entity1 has proven links to range of illnesses including cancer and stroke			0
authors of the study in @entity6 said the risks of being diagnosed with @entity3 's increased with age and having depression that did not respond to treatment			2
age and people with hard - to - treat depression are significant risk factors , according to the research according to @entity44 , one in 500 people in the @entity43 have the disease - a progressive neurological condition			1
mental health charities say depression affects one in five older people and about five million people in the country are living with the illness			0
lead author dr @entity53 , from @entity54 , said : ' our study suggests that depression may also be an independent risk factor for @entity3			0
' many questions remain , including whether depression is an early symptom of @entity3 rather than an independent risk factor for the disease			0
' our study also found that depression and older age , and having difficult - to - treat depression , were significant risk factors as well			1
' @entity3 's @entity43 said more research was needed into the link			2
dr @entity69 , research development manager at the charity , told @entity72 newspaper : ' this study found that people with depression were more likely to develop @entity3 's than those without depression			1
' but even among those with depression , the number of people who went on to develop @entity3 's was still only a fraction of those who took part			1
so there is by no means a direct link			0

scientists in @entity6 studied records *23,000* people over 10 years
those with depression 3.24 times more likely to be develop @entity3 's
age and hard - to - treat @entity3 's risk factors , scientists said
