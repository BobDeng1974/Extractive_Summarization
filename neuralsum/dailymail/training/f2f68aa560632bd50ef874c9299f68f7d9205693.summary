submerging an @entity1 gun and firing it underwater appears to make it work better , according to high speed footage			1
in an experiment posted online , a team put one of the automatic machine guns into an water - filled aquarium and filmed it using a high - speed camera			1
when the footage was slowed down , they discovered that not only does the weapon still fire while under water , it actually reloads itself faster			0
new high speed footage has revealed that submerging an @entity1 gun and firing it underwater appears to make it work better the @entity1 assault rifle is based on a gas recoil system			2
it uses the hot expanding gases of a bullet being fired to automatically rechamber the next round , @entity21 reports			0
the gas flows up through the chamber and back to the gun â€™s bolt , which forces it back			0

in an online experiment , a team sunk one of the automatic machine guns into an aquarium and filmed it using a high - speed camera they discovered that not only does the weapon happily still fire while under water , it actually reloads itself faster they discovered that not only does the weapon happily still fire while under water , it actually reloads itself faster the film shows the hosts build a tank to put the rifle in and then modify the gun to allow it to be fired via a long piece of string			1
they then remove the stock , build a replacement in the static underwater rig , then attach the gun to it , @entity52 reports			0
after first testing the gun outside of the tank , the @entity1 is placed in to the water - filled aquarium and is fired , forcing the tank to explode			2

the gun appears to fire better under water , because , they conclude , the chamber reloads faster because @entity68 can not be compressed surprisingly , the gun still works perfectly after the experiment			1
the team show the two high speed videos of the gun firing , slowed down , and played side by side			2
the gun appears to fire better under water , because , they conclude , the chamber reloads faster because @entity68 can not be compressed			1
however , although the gun 's mechanisms operate more efficiently underwater , the speed at which the bullets are released is slower .			0

a high speed video experiment posted online shows submerged gun firing
surprisingly , the gun still works perfectly after the experiment
it also reloads itself faster while submerged in the water - filled tank
experts say chamber reloads faster because @entity68 can not be compressed
