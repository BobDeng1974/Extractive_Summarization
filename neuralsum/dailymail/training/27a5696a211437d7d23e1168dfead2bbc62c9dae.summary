one of @entity2 ’s leading children ’s brain doctors snorted cocaine and an illegal party drug just before going on call at a major @entity7 hospital			1
shocking video footage shows dr @entity9 asking for a syringe to measure out the powerful sedative - a so - called ‘ date rape drug ’ known as @entity15 - before leaning over a kitchen worktop to consume a long line of cocaine			1
over nearly two debauched hours , in blatant contravention of hospital rules , the consultant paediatric neurologist took dose after dose of the highly addictive ghb and snorted nearly three grams of cocaine with an acquaintance			1
yet just over an hour later , the switchboard operator at @entity26 where he works confirmed dr @entity9 was on call – a role that involves making life - or - death decisions about his young patients , who suffer from disorders such as epilepsy and brain tumours			1
following @entity38 ’s investigation , the hospital has ordered an urgent inquiry and suspended the consultant from clinical work			1
last night , patients ’ groups said families would be horrified that a doctor looking after children could be taking mind - altering substances			2
@entity49 , co-director of @entity50 , said : ‘ you ca n’t have somebody taking things like that making life - or - death decisions			1
’ hospital rules , as laid out by the @entity57 , state staff should not take any substances that affect judgment either before starting shifts or while on duty , including on call			2
yet dr @entity9 ’s recorded comments and texts to his acquaintance suggest intimate familiarity with illegal recreational drugs			1
in the film footage , taken by his companion , @entity69 - born dr @entity9 is shown snorting a long line of cocaine after declaring : ‘ looking good , that			1
’ the drug can make users over-confident and impair decision - making abilities			1
it can also lead to fatal overdoses			0
those caught in possession of the @entity83 narcotic can be jailed for up to seven years			0
after snorting the cocaine , dr @entity9 turns to his acquaintance , takes the bottle of @entity15 – which he refers to as ‘ g ’ – and measures out a dose with a teaspoon and mixes it with blackcurrant squash			1
the doctor warns : ‘ you ’ve got to be careful – really careful – that you do n’t take too much of this stuff			0
’ he also says : ‘ i love to have a wee spot of this stuff			0
’ when his companion says that he finds ‘ it [ @entity86 ] hard to get hold of , ’ dr @entity9 tells him : ‘ i get mine in @entity100			1
’ @entity15 – or gamma - hydroxybutyrate – is popular with clubbers for loosening inhibitions , but its sedative effects when slipped into drinks mean it is also known as a date - rape drug			1
it is often referred to as liquid ecstasy			0
government websites warn it can lead to ‘ unconsciousness , coma and death ’ as well as causing memory loss and affecting judgment			2
dr @entity9 also expresses his fondness for crystal meth – which he refers to by the street name ‘ @entity118 ’ – a dangerously addictive @entity83 drug , the effects of which can last for days			1
dr @entity9 , 51 , is regarded as one of the foremost experts on childhood epilepsy and holds national and international posts on prestigious bodies			1
in 2007 he was part of a training team that received a @entity130 award , he is the national training adviser for the @entity132 and has given evidence in court cases and inquests about children who have had seizures , including at a murder trial			0
married with a teenage daughter , dr @entity9 has worked at @entity26 for 18 years , while his wife @entity140 is a nurse in its neonatal intensive care unit			1
but just before @entity143 he took time out to consume a cocktail of drugs while officially ‘ on call ’ for his patients			2
dr @entity9 ’s secret life was brought to this paper ’s attention by an acquaintance who said that they had met on 20 occasions since last june , consuming illegal drugs each time			1
‘ he told me he was a doctor and that he worked at the teaching hospital in @entity157 , but never went into any detail , ’ said the man			2
‘ it is only very recently i discovered that he was working with brain - injured children			0
i was totally shocked that someone with that much responsibility would take so many hard drugs			0
’ on wednesday , december 17 , the eminent consultant took the train from his home in a village near @entity168 to @entity169 on business but as soon as he started his return journey , he began making preparations for his depraved pastime			2
in a series of text messages , arrangements were made for three grams of cocaine to be brought to an early - evening meeting at the acquaintance ’s house , while dr @entity9 said he would bring @entity15			1
dr @entity9 asked : ‘ what can you get and how much is it ? ’ when his acquaintance claimed he ‘ can get coke ’ for £ 30 , dr @entity9 replied : ‘ ok			1
get three , ’ adding : ‘ i have some @entity15 ’ arriving at the man ’s smart semi-detached house in @entity168 at 4.40pm , dr @entity9 wasted no time in indulging his habit			1
he immediately produced his bottle of @entity15 with the words , ‘ you ’re gon na like that ’ , before placing it next to the pile of cocaine waiting for him on the kitchen counter			1
gesturing to the cocaine , he said it was ‘ looking good ’ before giving a throaty chuckle			2
he asked for a syringe to measure out the liquid ghb			0
‘ you got a syringe to measure this out ? ’ he asked the man			2
‘ have i got a what ? ’ ‘ like a syringe to measure this @entity86 out , ’ he repeated			2
the man asked the doctor what flavour squash he wanted to mix it with			0
‘ do you want orange , apple or blackcurrant ? ’ , to which the doctor replied : ‘ yeah , whatever , it does n’t matter			2
’ the video then clearly showed him snorting a long line of cocaine from a chopping board			2
still short of a syringe , dr @entity9 then started to look for a spoon			1
‘ have you got a teaspoon anywhere ? is there one in this drawer ? ’ ‘ middle drawer , ’ said the man			0
dr @entity9 then stirred the cocktail of ‘ g ’ and juice			1
he offered the drink to his acquaintance , who declined , then , after a gulp of the liquid and a line of cocaine , the pair headed to another part of the house , carrying the drugs with them			0
there , the conversation continued with further lines of cocaine and gulps of @entity15 being taken by the doctor at roughly 20 - minute intervals			1
in a tape - recorded conversation , the doctor extolled the pleasures of crystal meth			0
he asked his acquaintance : ‘ have you ever done @entity118 ? i would love to do @entity118 with you one time			0
two days later , you still feel it			0
’ as he prepared to leave , he asked : ‘ do you want me to leave you that @entity86 ? you had it before ? one thing – you need at least an hour between hits , right , and you need to measure it properly			2
’ after a final line of cocaine , the doctor left the house , jumping into his battered @entity263 and speeding away			2
within a minute of leaving at 6.30pm , he pulled up on a side road and following a ten - minute phone call , drove off at speed but not to his marital home			0
in a phone call to @entity26 at 7.45pm , just over an hour after he left the @entity168 house , @entity38 was told that dr @entity9 was ‘ on call ’ although the receptionist was unable to say whether he was in the hospital or at home			1
the next day he left the luxury detached home which he shares with his wife and daughter at 7.10am , from where he commuted to @entity157 general , arriving just after 8am			0
a spokesman for @entity57 said : ‘ we take any allegations of this nature extremely seriously and will be carrying out a thorough investigation			0
patient safety is our main priority and we expect all members of staff to behave in a professional and appropriate manner at all times			0
@entity291 : dr @entity9 , circled , in 2007 at the @entity292 with fellow epilepsy training experts to receive a top award for their work from @entity297 , second from left , now a @entity300 health minister this person answered the door at dr @entity9 's home today after footage emerged today showing him consuming drugs ‘ it is policy when investigating allegations of this nature that staff involved do not carry out clinical duties during the investigation			1
’ trust rules make it clear that staff can not take drugs while on call – but they are more likely to get counselling than the sack			0
it states : ‘ the consumption of alcohol , or other substances that might impact on judgment or performance , by employees is considered inappropriate prior to the commencement of duty , whilst on duty , during meal breaks or at any other time when it might result in unacceptable work performance ( eg on call )			0
being under the influence of alcohol or other substances at work can result in disciplinary action			0
‘ however , alcohol and drug dependency will normally be dealt with as a capability , rather than disciplinary , issue			0
the @entity57 will offer confidential support and counselling through the occupational health department and , where appropriate , by referral to external agencies			0
’ dr @entity9 did not respond to requests for comment			1
the doctor could also face misconduct proceedings from the @entity352			0
chairman of the health select committee , dr @entity355 , said she could not comment on his circumstances but said : ‘ in cases of substance abuse , we expect the @entity352 to act to protect patients			0
