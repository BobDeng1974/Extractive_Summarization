a woman who stopped eating after being bullied over the size of her breasts is to be the face of a new campaign against mental health stigma			1
so traumatised by repeated bullying about her large bust , @entity9 , now 31 , began to diet , which quickly spiraled into anorexia , resulting in her being admitted to hospital three times as the disease took over her life and left her dangerously ill. now @entity9 , from @entity16 , in @entity17 , has chosen to co-front a push by campaign group ' @entity20 ' , a @entity17 - wide bid to end mental health stigma and discrimination , managed by the @entity24 and the @entity25 ( @entity25 )			1
she said that people would tell her that all she had to do was ' pick up a fork ' and by not eating she was ' hurting ' her family			0
when boys at school began to tease @entity9 about her big breasts , she stopped eating in a bid to shrink her @entity44 chest , but soon found herself unable to stop dieting and in the grip of anorexia			1
at her lowest ebb , @entity9 weighed just 4st 7lb and told by doctors to eat or risk dying			1
after seeing anorexia claim the lives of two friends , @entity9 turned the corner with the help of rehab clinic @entity56			1
her experiences prompted her to take part in the new campaign will be launched in @entity61 's @entity60 on october 28			2
@entity9 is speaking about her story to help others and is encouraging people to join the @entity32 campaign			1
she said : ' it only takes one person to change someone else 's actions and that can have a knock - on affect			2
' miss @entity9 ( pictured at 17 ) was teased at school about the size of her breasts and became depressed at her lowest ebb , @entity9 weighed just 4st 7lb and told by doctors to eat or risk dying see me says nine out of ten people with mental health problems still suffer from stigma or discrimination in work , education , health care and at home			1
@entity20 programme director @entity84 , said : ' we are launching a campaign which signals the end of a culture in @entity17 that actively discriminates against people with mental health problems , stigmatising them and their families			1
' everyone has mental health and we can all be hit by mental ill - health			2
but we each have the power to make a positive difference in the lives of our families , friends and colleagues when they are affected by mental health problems			2
@entity9 said the stigma she faced when she had the eating disorder led to her ' questioning herself as a person ' ' @entity20 , our partners , allies and supporters are building a movement which will bring people together from all over the country and encourage them to challenge discrimination at its roots			1
' our goal is equality that ensures people with mental health problems have the same opportunities as others to lead a fulfilled life			2
' the campaign also fronted by businessman @entity120 who was in charge of 2000 employees across two companies when he had a breakdown co-fronting the campaign with @entity9 is @entity120 , who was a senior director in the rail industry , in charge of 2000 employees across two companies when he had a breakdown			1
mr @entity120 , 61 , from @entity129 , @entity130 , said the discrimination he faced had been ' horrendous '			1
he said : ' when i was a senior director i was constantly being contacted , as soon as it was revealed i had a break down from depression all communication with me stopped			0
' people avoided having conversations with me , it was quite dreadful			0
' on one occasion a job centre worker told him there was ; no point ' in continuing with an interview after he broke down in tears in front of 70 people			0
he said the stigma of his depression left him feeling ' worthless , alone and frightened '			2
see me said that two out of three people with mental health problems actually stop some day to day activities because of the fear of stigma			1
the programme , to end mental health stigma and discrimination , want people to take action , which collectively will give a united and powerful voice to change negative behaviour			1
the action could range from directly challenging someone they see discriminating , to supporting someone who is struggling due to a mental health problem			2
with one in four people likely to experience a mental health problem every year , the new campaign is calling on the other three in four to be there to help			1
the true medical toll of the hundreds of young people who suffer from eating disorders has been revealed the true medical toll of the hundreds of young people who suffer from eating disorders has been revealed in new figures released by the @entity178 - showing the problem could be four times as big as first thought			2
@entity178 hospitals have seen a sharp rise in the number of patients seen for conditions such as anorexia and bulimia in recent years			2
but new statistics show patients who suffer from an eating disorder are frequently treated at hospital for a life - threatening condition linked to their illness - rather than the eating disorder itself			1
for every patient seen in hospital for direct treatment of their eating disorder another three such patients are given appointments for ailments linked to their anorexia or bulimia			1
it means hospitals are treating hundreds of eating disorder patients for critical blood disorders , poisoning with prescription and over-the - counter medicines as well as severe stomach pains and vomiting			0
the full extent of the health problems associated with eating disorders comes after the @entity217 ( @entity217 ) revealed more details on the hospital records of eating disorder patients			2
in the document it shows that last year there were 3,127 occasions where people were treated in hospital where physicians logged the patient 's main illness as an eating disorder			1
but there were also another 8,661 sessions in hospitals where doctors recorded a person suffering from such an illness being treated for a different but critical medical ailment			1
it means that every day of the year around 30 people get so sick because of their eating disorder that they need hospital treatment			0
experts think even this figure is a vast underestimate of the number of people suffering from eating disorders as it is only when things tend to become desperate that these patients are treated in hospital			0
other than being treated directly for their eating disorder the other most common ailments that these patients were treated for in the last year were : 1			0
chemical imbalance of the blood - 762 2			0
accidental or deliberate poisoning by painkillers - 657 3			0
mental and behavioural disorders due to alcohol - 304 4			0
pain in the stomach and pelvic area - 304 5			0
accidental or deliberate poisoning by psychiatric medicines - 252 6			0
personality disorders - 176 7			0
insulin - dependent diabetes - 167 patients who suffer from an eating disorder are frequently treated at hospital for a life - threatening condition linked to their illness 8			1
accidental or deliberate poisoning by tranquilizers - 162 9			0
nausea and vomiting - 138 10			0
other diseases of the digestive system - 127 separate @entity178 figures show that women aged 15 to 19 are the group most likely to receive hospital care for their eating disorders - with appointment for women outstripping men by ten to one			1
a spokesman for the eating disorder charity beat , said : ' eating disorders are psychological illnesses with physical consequences and certainly we know that where an individual has an eating disorder as well as diabetes that these two conditions must be treated together			0
similarly a personality disorder should also be treated alongside the eating disorder			0
' those hospitalised with an eating disorder diagnosis are very much the tip of the iceberg - there are many hundreds of thousands of others who are awaiting treatment or not had the courage to seek it			0
' early diagnosis and quick access to treatment is crucial when treating an eating disorder which has the highest mortality rate of any psychological illness			0
