discussions on the social media site @entity51 have seen some users propose the animal was seeking a pilgrimage for a @entity56 's blessing			1
others deduced the holy hog was merely seeking food or resting after an act of physical exertion			0
another web user offered a more scientific explanation : the pig was suffering from a disease concerning a deficiency in vitamin e , which can lead to an inability to stand up on all fours and kneel on one 's front legs			0
it was later revealed the 150kg pig has escaped from a nearby farm with two other cohorts in search of food meanwhile , the owner of the pig later revealed it had escaped his hog pen on the morning on february 22 , apparently in search of food			1
