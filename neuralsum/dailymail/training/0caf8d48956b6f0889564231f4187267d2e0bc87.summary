booking a ticket online to head to a sports match is normally a simple process as you fly through the forms			0
putting in your details is a bit of an arduous process but most of us are normally happy to be called either mr , mrs or @entity13 however , as first reported in @entity16 's @entity15 column , the online registration form at @entity18 's this summer offers an extensive list of 52 titles to ensure fans can choose the appropriate title for their tickets to catch this summer 's @entity25 series , with the second test against @entity27 hosted at the @entity28			1
the @entity29 meets @entity31 players during the ashes at @entity28 between @entity31 and @entity27 in 2013 they say they want to make all members of society feel welcome – though the majority of the list comprises aristocratic and religious titles and military ranks			1
not to mention @entity29 , for the most important guest of all			0
other titles on offer include : brigadier , @entity45 , captain , commander , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity18 , @entity52 , @entity53 , and wing commander			2
however , the list is by no means comprehensive , including earls and viscounts but not dukes			0
the military ranks also exclude admirals or generals			0
a spokesman for @entity18 ’s said : ‘ we have within our membership a complete cross-section of society , including the queen who is a patron			2
@entity29 , a patron of @entity28 , meets the @entity31 squad during the 2013 @entity25 series the @entity29 watches the ashes between @entity31 and @entity27 in 2013 from the pavilion at @entity28 prime minister @entity72 reacts as he is interviewed on @entity74 's @entity73 at @entity28 in 2013 ‘ the membership committee took the decision that they wanted all members to be able to title themselves correctly			1
’ usually ticket applications for sports events and concerts allow buyers to choose from just three titles – mr , mrs or ms. but cricket fans entering the ballot to see the @entity31 internationals against @entity27 and also @entity90 matches against @entity91 are free to select any title they wish ... which is expected to encourage a few of the more mischievous members of the public to adopt titles that do n’t belong to them			2
others who might find the extensive list of titles useful are former cricket @entity101 ( left ) , and former prime minister sir @entity103 ( right ) , a well - known fan of the sport on the rare occasions that royalty attend test matches – the @entity29 visited the @entity18 ’s match against @entity27 in 2013 – it is unlikely they would opt to sit among the masses			1
@entity29 , and other @entity112 , would be seated in the pavilion and would not , of course , be required to buy tickets			0
the ballot for the @entity90 with @entity27 , which starts on july 16 , and a test against @entity91 in may closed at one minute to midnight last night			1
the cricket ground , in @entity118 , uses the ballot system as a fair way of allocating tickets for matches which are often oversubscribed , because it gives all applicants an equal opportunity			1
lord ’s was established in 1814 and is widely regarded as the @entity28 .			0
