by @entity0 published : 14:38 est , 20 july 2012 updated : 12:33 est , 21 july 2012 a seven - month - old baby died after being refused access to a notorious hospital because the @entity5 department closed at night and the children 's ward was dealing with an emergency			1
@entity9 lived just two and - a - half miles from @entity10 , but had to be driven 22 miles to a second hospital by paramedics			1
yesterday her devastated parents told how the infant died just two minutes before arriving at the @entity15 in @entity16 49 minutes after paramedics had first reached her			1
seven - month old @entity9 died after being refused access to @entity10 because its @entity5 department is shut at night and the children 's ward was full the family called 999 after @entity9 's mother , @entity23 , discovered her unconscious in her cot			1
up to that point @entity9 had been a normal , healthy baby			1
@entity10 's @entity5 has been shut between 10pm and 8am since december because of staff shortages			1
it was due to reopen in march , but the closure has been extended to october because @entity30 still needs to recruit additional staff			0
@entity9 's father @entity32 said this - and an already full children 's ward - had led to up to a 20 - minute delay in getting @entity9 to a hospital			1
mr @entity32 said : ' we were actually told that she died two minutes away from @entity38 , but if she had gone to @entity10 and they had managed to put a drip in and stabilise her , then send her to @entity38 , she would still be here today			1
' the infant was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital			1
@entity9 lived just two and - a - half miles from @entity10 , but was driven elsewhere news of the incident came just a day after the @entity45 ( @entity45 ) reported the hospital was now ' meeting all the essential standards of quality '			1
the watchdog 's findings came three years after a damning report by its predecessor , the @entity53 , revealed ' appalling standards of care ' and higher - than - expected death rates			2
last night , the @entity57 reported how @entity9 's parents called 999 on the night of june 28 , with a paramedic arriving just four minutes later at 22:46 bst			1
according to the ambulance service , both the officer at the scene and ambulance control contacted @entity65 's @entity5 department but were told the unit could not accept @entity9			2
@entity9 was instead taken to @entity67 in @entity16 22 miles away requests to take the baby to the children 's ward at @entity65 were also refused , the ambulance service said			1
a hospital spokesman said the paediatric ward had been full and handling an emergency at the time			2
it was at 23:37 bst that the baby reached the @entity16 hospital			2
both @entity80 and the @entity82 trust said it was impossible to say whether admitting @entity9 to @entity10 would have made a difference			1
@entity85 , director of nursing and midwifery at @entity10 , told the @entity57 it would have been unsafe for the paediatric unit to have accepted @entity9			1
' the staff were already treating a very seriously ill child who had been brought in as an emergency and they were also caring for a number of other emergency admissions and sick children , ' he said			0
' the staff correctly followed the joint protocol between the hospital and @entity80 for these circumstances			2
' ' the staff were already treating a very seriously ill child who had been brought in as an emergency and they were also caring for a number of other emergency admissions and sick children			0
' @entity85 in a statement , @entity82 trust said : ' when contacted by the @entity108 ambulance crew , our paediatric ward told the crew that they were unable to accept the baby because they did not have the capacity in the ward and were already dealing with an emergency			0
' as per the agreed protocol , the ambulance crew were directed to take the baby to @entity118			0
' the ambulance crew also contacted our @entity5 department , who repeated the instruction that the baby should be taken to @entity118			0
' he said an internal investigation had found ' this was not reported as a serious incident '			0
' there was no reason to discipline or suspend any member of staff			0
' a spokeswoman for @entity131 and @entity132 , the strategic health authority , said it had not been informed about the incident			0
' it is disappointing that this incident was not formally reported and we are now seeking assurances from the @entity139 organisations that this is being investigated , in order to fully understand what took place , ' she said			0
an initial post-mortem examination was unable to find the cause of death and an inquest will be held in due course			0
on thursday , the @entity45 said it was lifting all of its concerns around @entity10 following visits in june to review areas where it had ' previously registered moderate and minor concerns ' , the trust said			2
chief executive @entity155 said : ' we have been confident for some time that we had made all the improvements which were needed			0
' we know that we still do n't get it right every time for every patient but this report is confirmation that we are definitely well on the way			0
' the 2009 @entity53 report revealed a catalogue of care failings could have cost up to 1,200 lives at the hospital			2
a Â£ 10million public inquiry into standards at the hospital ended last november after 139 days			0
its chairman , @entity171 , is expected to publish his final report - which will contain recommendations to stop the failings at the trust being repeated elsewhere - in october .			0
