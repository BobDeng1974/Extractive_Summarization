a @entity2 woman has spoken out after being drugged at a celebrity hot spot and waking up the following day to learn she had not only gone home with one man , she had also had sex with two others			1
@entity9 's ordeal happened on june 30 after she went to @entity10 , a @entity11 hot spot where a-listers @entity12 , @entity14 and @entity15 , partied less than a month later			1
ms @entity16 30 , had gone to the venue to drink with a girlfriend , and had sunbathed naked , which the club allows			0
but after five hours beside the pool and $ 36 worth of drinks she blacked out			1
@entity9 , 30 , said she woke up with bruised thighs and immediately knew she had been ' roofied ' the next day , she told @entity24 , she woke up with bruises on her inner thighs and a lubricant beside her bed which she had never seen before			1
her car keys were also gone			0
she said : ' i did n't know where they came from and i immediately knew i was roofied because i know how much i had to drink , i know how much i can drink and there was zero memory , nothing			0
' accompanied by a friend , she went back to the club where she watched security footage to help her piece together what had happened the night before			0
what she saw and heard from eyewitnesses shocked her			0
as well as signing a much larger bar tab and shouting at a bar tender , she learned that she had had sex with one man in the pool , another in the sauna , and had gone home with a third man dressed only in a towel			1
ms @entity9 is n't claiming all the the men raped her , and only wants to find the person who drugged her			1
she said : ' i 'm kind - of of the opinion that if there 's three innocent people and one that 's not , i 'm not gon na take down the three innocent people because this one person wants to be a sicko , you know ? ' scene : the incident took place at @entity10 , a @entity11 hot spot which allows nude sunbathing @entity12 and @entity14 , seen here with @entity68 at the premiere of his new movie this week , went to the @entity71 on july 21 , along with @entity12 's sister @entity15 according to authorities , drug rape is common in @entity2 , which has a culture of heavy drinking			1
@entity77 , director of @entity78 at @entity79 , said the crime was n't necessarily on the rise , but was receiving far more publicity			0
one high profile case involves former @entity85 star @entity84 who is accused of drugging and raping women in @entity2 and in four other states			2
but unlike in the @entity84 case , where he is accused of using drugs that incapacitated the woman involved , ms @entity9 is believed to have been drugged with a substance that simply makes its victims forget what they 've done			1
all traces of it , also disappear from the body within 12 hours			0
ms @entity9 said : ' that 's where it gets tricky because , i mean , i saw myself on video walking out of there , laughing and waving to the bartender , stumbling out of there , and , you know , this guy 's drunk , i appear to be drunk and i just do n't think it would be right for me to say everybody raped me			2
' ms @entity9 is also angry at the way the @entity110 ( @entity110 ) handled her case			2
by the time they took her to hospital for testing , it was too late for doctors to find traces of the drug used in her system			2
former @entity85 star @entity84 is accused of drugging and raping women in @entity2 and in four other states ; he is accused of using drugs that incapacitated the women involved before having sex with them ms @entity77 said ' the number one thing ' anyone suspected of being raped should do , is get to the hospital immediately			1
the @entity110 defended its decision to gather more evidence before taking ms @entity9 to the hospital			2
a police spokesman said that 's standard procedure for such an investigation and said the department wants to keep working with ms @entity9			2
@entity137 , a forensic nurse at @entity140 's @entity139 unit , says sex predators often use @entity142 , or @entity143 , which can be made at home and only stays in a victim 's system for 12 hours			0
the drug is known to lower peoples inhibitions			0
another factor in the case is that @entity2 police also has a bad reputation for solving sex crimes			1
reported rape cares there are far below any other @entity157 city with a major crime problem			0
and a survey of 90 sex crimes in the area last year found nearly half of them had been mischaracterized as lesser offenses			0
ms @entity9 said she has received a lot of support from women friends who say they had experienced similar things , but she is also getting criticized for not pursuing charges against all of the men she had sex with			1
@entity172 , @entity10 's vice president and attorney , told @entity24 that the club has very strict rules against sex on the premises and works hard to protect its clients			0
@entity9 has spoken out about being drugged at a @entity2 bar and waking the next day with no memory of the previous night , only to learn she had had sex with three men ( stock image )			1

@entity9 thought she had spent just $ 36 on drinks at a @entity2 bar
