ms @entity22 just hopes to prevent other women from suffering in the way that she has			1
' i know [ @entity10 ] wo n't be charged for manslaughter now but if it does happen again i think it 's an important thing to realise it was a child , ' she said			2

' we both come from a big family - i come from four and he 's from ten â€“ and we both want a big family , ' she said			0

the 27 - year - old hopes to see a bill known as @entity111 passed through @entity112 , which would criminalise grievous bodily harm to a foetus of 20 weeks or more the crash had a major impact on ms @entity22 ' family , pictured here are her brother @entity72 ( left ) who was driving the car , sister @entity171 , brother @entity172 who was a passenger , and her mum ( right ) ' i 'm 27 and i 'm going through menopause , it 's ridiculous , ' she said			1
' @entity178 all these issues around @entity181 surrogacy , surrogacy in @entity1 is illegal and for us to even have that option we 'd have to consider overseas			2
' ms @entity22 said the crash has also affected her social life , especially at an age where many friends are getting married and having children			1
' people do n't really know how to be around you , they wonder if they should give their baby to you to hold or is that insensitive , ' she said			0

' i know he 's really depressed , he has n't found work , ' ms @entity38 said			0
