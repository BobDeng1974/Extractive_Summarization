by @entity0 published : 10:24 est , 17 january 2013 updated : 20:24 est , 17 january 2013 a former fishery owner is demanding £ 2.5million damages from the @entity3 claiming that otters it introduced to a nearby river ate all his 22,000 carp			2
@entity8 said the agency set up an otter haven without informing him of the impact they would have on the stock in his six lakes			1
mr @entity8 , 60 , established the @entity16 near @entity17 , @entity18 , digging out the lakes and filling them with £ 250,000 worth of fish			1
but then the agency set up the otter haven a couple of miles away on the @entity23			0
mr @entity8 said his business never quite got off the ground and he decided to sell some of his stock in 2008 – but found that he had none			1
carnivorous : fishery owner @entity8 claims otters have decimated the fish at his lakes ( library image ) carnage : these skeletons are all that remain of carp eaten by otters at another fishery ‘ when i netted one lake that i thought had 8,500 carp in nothing came out , ’ he said			1
‘ this has ruined me financially			0
’ he said he has been unable to sell the fishery and it has now been taken off him by his mortgage company			0
he claims that over a period of years his valuable fish were decimated by the carnivorous creatures , ruining his business before it had got off the ground , the 60 - year - old claims			0
mr @entity8 said that had the @entity3 told him of the probability of otters re-colonising the nearby river he could have taken protective steps , like putting up a protective fencing			1
he is suing the agency for breaching the @entity59 , claiming it had a duty of care to consult landowners when planning the otter initiative			0
mr @entity8 is seeking £ 2.5 million to cover the loss of income he believes he would have recouped from anglers using his fishery			1
bad for business : mr @entity8 said he is unable to sell his @entity16 , which lies empty and out of use unwelcome visitors : mr @entity8 took this picture of an otter feeding ground at his @entity18 fishery the matter will go before the @entity74 next month in what could become a landmark case for fishery owners across the country who have had similar issues with otters			1
buzzards were almost extinct 30 years ago but there are now nearly 40,000 in @entity84			1
but it caused red faces at @entity87 , which wanted tighter controls on the species to protect pheasants but had to scrap the plans last year after a public outcry			0
in @entity94 , cane toads were successfully introduced in the 1930s			0
but they have been blamed for a sharp dip in other predatory reptiles ever since			0
they have also been accused of putting quolls in danger , with the native marsupial partial to the toad 's toxic skin			0
@entity84 are still shocked when they see a wallaby hoping around			1
the animal - a common sight in @entity94 - was brought into the wild in the @entity84 in 1930s and sightings continue today			1
a more recent success in the @entity84 is the beaver , which was reintroduced from @entity114 more centuries after disappearing			1
since then they have returned to nearly every corner of @entity84			1
but critics say the scheme has been ill thought as there is not enough food in our waterways to sustain their booming numbers			1
as a result otters - which have no natural predator - are said to have been picking off big and cumbersome fish from fisheries and putting them in jeopardy			2
mr @entity8 's @entity16 , near @entity17 , in @entity18 , has lain empty and out of use for several years now			1
he said : ' this has ruined me financially and left me devastated			0
i built a fishery from scratch , there was nothing there at all before			0
' i got all of the planning permission and it took me a few years to dig out the six lakes and filled them up with carp			2
' in all that time did n't know the @entity3 were promoting a nature reserve on the nearby @entity144			0
nobody said a word to me about the otters			2
' we then started hearing all these stories about otters being spotted no more than two miles away from us			2
' in 2008 i set about trying to sell off some carp to and when i netted a lake that had 8,500 carp in nothing came out			0
' i brought a consultant in and we drained the lake and it was empty			0
i later found evidence of fish bones that had been stripped of its flesh			0
' my case is that under the @entity59 , the @entity3 had a duty to carry out some sort of notice or consultation with me before the work began to encourage otters into the area			2
price of success : otters are flourishing across @entity84 thanks to a programme of reintroducing them to the wild ' this case could open the way for other fishery owners in @entity84 who feel they have not been given sufficient warning about the rising otter population			1
' mr @entity8 spent 22 years working as a process control engineer at oil and gas refineries in the @entity184 and saved up to start up his fishery business			2
@entity186 , a spokesman for @entity187 , said : ' we are preparing to challenge this claim robustly on all counts			0
' the four - day hearing is set to take place at the @entity74 in @entity193 on february 25			2
@entity194 form the brink : otters were on the verge of extinction in @entity84 30 years ago			1

@entity8 is seeking *compensation* in the landmark @entity74 case
his six lakes , near @entity204 , @entity18 , have lain empty and out of use
otters have flourished since being reintroduced to the wild across the @entity84
critics say there are not enough food in waterways to sustain the numbers
