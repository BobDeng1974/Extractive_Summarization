@entity0 has n't dwelled on being the first person in the @entity2 to successfully receive part of a liver from a living donor 25 years ago , a medical procedure that paved the way for routine live - donor transplants			1
the anniversary falls on @entity10 this year			0
@entity0 was 21 months old when her mother , @entity11 , donated more than a third of her liver to save her daughter from a disorder called biliary atresia			1
its success has enabled her to live a normal life , almost completely untouched by what was an often - fatal disorder			1
milestone : @entity0 , who was the first in the @entity2 to successfully receive a liver from a living donor 25 years ago , poses with her husband , @entity25 , in their home in @entity28 , @entity29 ' most of the time , i did n't think about it , ' @entity0 , 26 , said in an interview this week at her home in @entity28 , @entity29 , noting her good health has enabled her to enjoy ballet and tap dancing since age five			1
' all of my anniversaries are really big , so that 's when you really think about it the most			2
' the procedure expanded the options for children with liver disorders , many of whom died while waiting for a liver from a deceased donor			2
it was first used only in small children			0
it 's now used for older children , and at some transplant centers , for adults			0
biliary atresia is a disease that blocks liver bile ducts , backing up bile in the bloodstream and the liver			1
before @entity0 's operation , liver transplants from living donors had been performed only four times - in @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69			1
those surgeries involved desperately ill children			0
@entity0 's transplant was the first on a child with time to wait			1
an adult liver grows back to normal after the operation			2
the segment transplanted grows within the recipient			0
the @entity81 team that performed the surgery on @entity0 was led by dr. @entity83			1
the youngest member was dr. @entity85 , then 41			0
' i can tell you we were all extremely concerned about the safety of the mother , @entity90 , who was just a trouper throughout , ' @entity85 said			0
' we were really thankful she got through the operation safely			0
the feeling when @entity0 's operation was finished was one of elation that it appeared to be a success			1
' it was a feeling we had really done something worthwhile that would help , not just this patient , but others as well			0
' using parents as living donors posed complex ethical questions			1
with a parent willing to risk anything to help her child , how could the doctors be sure they were upholding the ethical standard of informed consent ? before the first surgery , the @entity81 team published a paper in the prestigious @entity115 on how they intended to answer ethical questions as they selected patients and donors			0
they would n't use the living donor procedures in emergencies to reduce the time pressure on a donor 's decision			1
a two - week cooling - off period would give the donor time to reflect and possibly back out			2
and a liver specialist would act as the donor 's advocate throughout the process , assigned to champion the donor 's health and safety			1
the landmark paper helped shape ethical standards still used today			0
dr. @entity138 , director of the @entity139 at the @entity81 , said publishing the paper before the first surgery helped the team gather professional and public comment and criticism - essentially what is now called ' crowdsourcing			2
' that in itself is regarded as ' an ethical breakthrough in ways to approach and improve surgical innovation , ' said @entity138 , who co-authored the paper			0
for @entity11 , who was 29 during the transplant , @entity10 will be a time to reflect with gratitude			2
' i guess the biggest thing is that our goal was for her to have a normal healthy life : to be able to graduate from high school , graduate from college , get married , ' @entity11 said			2
' so , as she 's achieved all of those , each one is a memory and a reminder of it , but that the ultimate goal was achieved long before that : her just having a normal life where it was n't a constant reminder			0

@entity0 , 26 , was the first person in the @entity2 to successfully receive part of a liver from a living donor 25 years ago
