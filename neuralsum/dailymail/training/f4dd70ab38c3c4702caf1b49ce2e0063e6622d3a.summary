by @entity0 published : 03:26 est , 26 july 2012 updated : 04:07 est , 26 july 2012 architect : @entity2 say @entity3 would n't testify despite creating the @entity5 act @entity3 was lambasted by @entity2 today for failing to answer their questions on the @entity7 , even though he was the law 's architect			1
the former prime minister called the act ' one of the greatest mistakes i made in office ' and now refused to appear before the @entity15 justice select committee to discuss it , it was revealed today			1
@entity5 allows any person in @entity17 to request information from public bodies			1
sir @entity20 , the committee 's chairman , said mr @entity3 was given every chance to give evidence at a convenient time but only answered written questions after a press report suggested they would be critical of his non-appearance			1
' we deplore mr @entity3 ’s failure to cooperate with a committee of the @entity33 , despite being given every opportunity to attend at a time convenient to him , ' sir @entity20 said			1
their new report made no major recommendations to reduce the openness created by the @entity7 laws and did not recommend fees should be brought in to recoup the costs of answering requests			2
but its findings were finalised before the @entity2 received a letter from mr @entity3 , who came up with the idea of the @entity7 as prime minister , saying that it undermined discussions at the highest levels of government			1
sir @entity20 said : ' former prime minister @entity3 described himself as a " nincompoop " for his role in the legislation , saying that it was " antithetical to sensible government "			1
' yet when we sought to question mr @entity3 on his change of opinion he refused to defend his views before us and submitted answers to our written questions only after our report was agreed , and after a press report had appeared , suggesting we might criticise his failure to give evidence			1
' no show : mr @entity3 sent written responses to questions rather than appear in @entity71 the report said the existing legislation already intended to provide a ' safe space ' for policy - making in which ministers could be given frank advice by officials and this should be respected by everyone			1
ministerial vetoes would , from time to time , need to be used to protect this space , the report added			2
it said the ' potential risks of a chilling effect - if it is a reality - go beyond a bowdlerising or editing of the records '			2
' it is that no record exists , because ministers may avoid holding formal meetings entirely , ' the committee said			2
appearance : former @entity17 prime minister @entity3 gave evidence to the @entity98 , pictured , but would not appear before the justice committee but research by the @entity101 found the ' chilling effect ' of @entity5 laws appeared “ negligible to marginal ” , despite the concerns raised by former senior ministers and officials			1
retired cabinet secretary lord @entity108 told the @entity2 that ministers and officials ' are going to find ways around it , things are not going to be written down ' and the cost of ministers ’ mobile phone bills will rise			0
' that , to me , makes for worse government and it makes it impossible for ( historians ) to try to recreate accurately what has gone on when there are no records , ' he warned			0
the @entity2 ’ report concluded : ' given the uncertainty of the evidence we do not recommend any major diminution of the openness created by the @entity7			0
' but , given the clear intention of @entity71 in passing the legislation that it should allow a ‘ safe space ’ for policy formation and @entity135 discussion , we remind everyone involved in both using and determining that space that the @entity7 was intended to protect high - level policy discussions			0
the @entity7 was passed in november 2000 , three years after @entity3 , its architect , first became prime minister			1
it came into force in january 2005 , giving the public a right to access all types of recorded information held by taxpayer - funded authorities and organisations			0
these include government departments , councils and the @entity153			0
there are certain exceptions allowed to be used to prevent some information being released			0
these include if it would cost too much to collate , it is not in the public interest to publish or is a matter of national security			0
' we also recognise that the realities of government mean that the ministerial veto will have to be used from time to time to protect that space			0
' the report also called for higher fines for the destruction of information , along with changes to protect universities from having to disclose research before the paper has been published			0
dr @entity176 , director general of the @entity177 , backed the report , saying that if research data was not exempt from @entity5 legislation ' then we are in real danger of killing the goose that lays the golden eggs '			2
' @entity184 and transparency must have limitations in order to protect our national interests , including national security and the safety of our researchers			0
' @entity192 , director of the civil liberties campaign group @entity193 , added : ' access to information is an essential part of holding government to account			0
' as the committee has found , the @entity7 already protects sensitive discussions and those seeking to restore a veil of secrecy to decision making should not be allowed to stem the flow of information , by charging or limiting the scope of the @entity7			2
a spokesman for mr @entity3 ’s office said he had submitted written evidence to the committee in response to its questions .			1

the former *pm* would n't come before the @entity15 ' justice committee
mr @entity3 said he was a ' nincompoop ' to create @entity5
*mps* angry about his failure to *co-operate*
