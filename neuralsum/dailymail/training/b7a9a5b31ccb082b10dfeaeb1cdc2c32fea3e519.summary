embattled @entity1 war reporter @entity0 alienated her colleagues with her insatiable appetite for risk , and got her security firm in @entity6 fired after her ex walked in on her with another man			2
in a fascinating expose , @entity9 has shed light on the @entity13 journalist 's spectacular rise to the top spot of chief foreign correspondent at the @entity1 evening news and 60 minutes and how her equally stellar fall from grace thanks to a @entity19 report that turned out to be fabricated means question marks remain about her return			1
@entity23 cut her teeth in @entity25 before convincing her employer - morning show @entity26 - to send her to @entity27 , @entity28 , following the 9/11 attacks , knowing immediately that the fallout in the @entity31 was the story of her career			1
with no reporters on the ground , @entity1 enlisted @entity23 to cover the fall of @entity27 for the evening news			1
she found a satellite and dispatched a report			0
the coverage was immediately noticed , not just at the top of @entity1 but competing networks			1
she soon had negotiated , with the help of an agent , a $ 1million full - time contract at @entity1 including work on a 60 minutes spin - off			1
' she 's got t * ts and balls , ' is how the late @entity60 correspondent @entity59 summed up @entity23 's appeal , according to @entity9			1
but her brazen attitude rubbed some people up the wrong way			1
@entity9 revealed that some producers considered her difficult and many colleagues found her ' almost insatiable stomach for risk ' hard to deal with			2
sources told the magazine that one of her security detail was shot during a trip to @entity75 to see an @entity77 training camp and , after a time , cameramen in the @entity25 bureau of @entity1 ' revolted ' against her , fearing for their safety			1
' they thought she was dangerous and she was going to get somebody killed , ' a @entity1 executive told @entity9			1
she also flouted traditional @entity84 dress codes , which inevitably put herself and her entourage in precarious positions			0
however , @entity1 chairman and ceo @entity87 loved her and she knew it			2
' [ @entity23 ] was very fond of saying , " i could end your career with a phone call , " ' a former @entity1 producer told @entity9 of the reporter			1
the in - depth article also reveals how @entity23 had @entity1 's security team fired after her ex caught her in a compromising position with another man - now her husband @entity101			1
in a fascinating expose , @entity9 has shed light on the bombshell @entity13 journalist 's spectacular rise to the top spot of chief foreign correspondent at the @entity1 evening news and 60 minutes and her equally stellar fall from grace thanks to the october 27 , 2013 , @entity19 report , pictured big scoop : finally , after months with no leads , 60 minutes producer @entity112 was offered an exclusive : the first look at a book by a man claiming to have witnessed the attack , pictured @entity23 was protected by a team of former @entity121 special forces soldiers employed by @entity122 who guarded the @entity1 bureau in @entity38 and transported her to the various dangerous locations she needed to be for stories			1
but her patience with the company was wearing thin , @entity9 reported			2
by late 2007 , @entity23 has been seeing renowned @entity133 correspondent @entity132 , who worked for @entity134 and @entity135 , for some time but had @entity101 in the wings			1
@entity101 was a government contractor in @entity38 whose company did public relations for the military , trying to get positive war stories into print			0
he began paying regular visits to the @entity1 compound and on one such amorous visit , @entity132 sprung the pair after security let him up to her quarters on the second floor			2
according to @entity151 , @entity132 and @entity23 began to argue			0
with tensions high , @entity23 blamed @entity153 for letting @entity132 up when they knew she was with @entity101 , and she pulled the contract , giving it instead to their rival company @entity158			2
this showed her clout at the network			0
' a lot of people were p * ssed , ' a former @entity1 employee told @entity9 , adding that the @entity168 security team had befriended many			1
but @entity1 boss , @entity169 , was n't fazed			0
in fact , he seemed somewhat proud when news broke of @entity23 's @entity38 affairs , hanging a framed copy of a @entity175 story headlined ' @entity176 ' in his office			1
not long after , @entity23 returned to @entity178 with @entity101 , and they had their first child			0
however , she 'd been promoted to chief foreign correspondent so was always jetting to war zones for stories			1
she was on the front line at the uprisings in @entity186 during the @entity187 , still her brazen self despite having a family back home			0
' she was told 15 different ways : " do not leave the hotel after curfew , " and she did , ' a source told @entity9			0
lovers : @entity0 and her husband @entity195 are pictured at the 2013 @entity196 ( left ) while reporter @entity132 is seen right early career : @entity0 is pictured here as a reporter for @entity199 in 2002			0
from there she moved to @entity27 where she was noticed by @entity1 on february 3 , @entity23 was detained by @entity186 security forces and her local driver was badly beaten			1
she flew out the next day , but within a week she was back , unable to keep away from the brewing chaos in @entity204			0
however , this time things got even more ugly			0
in @entity206 , @entity23 said that she and her crew began getting verbal threats from the increasingly violent crowd			0
@entity23 described being separated from her security team and then a mob of men ripped off her clothes and assaulted her			0
when she returned to the @entity215 she had immense support from her colleagues , however she struggled to return to the field , @entity9 reported			2
she was handed soft stories and quickly grew restless			0
president @entity219 winding down @entity215 military involvement in the @entity31 also made for fewer war stories in general			0
but then came the attack on the @entity19 , @entity224 , consulate in 2012			0
this offered a return to form , and , according to the magazine , @entity23 pounced on the opportunity			2
she was determined to get the scoop on what happened , and no other 60 minutes correspondent was allowed to pursue stories on @entity19			1
' this was her story , and nobody could do anything on it , ' a 60 minutes staffer told @entity9			1
finally , after months with no leads , 60 minutes producer @entity112 was offered an exclusive : the first look at a book by a man claiming to have witnessed the attack			1
assault : in this february 11 , 2011 photo released by @entity1 , 60 minutes correspondent @entity0 is shown covering the reaction in in @entity204 's @entity206 the day @entity186 president @entity250 stepped down			1
@entity1 says @entity23 was attacked , and suffered a brutal beating and sexual assault before being saved by a group of women and an estimated 20 @entity186 soldiers on leave : @entity23 and producer @entity112 were both put on an indefinite leave of absence last year , as @entity1 scrambled to salvage the long - running 60 minutes reputation the @entity261 , was written under the pseudonym @entity263 , by former military contractor named @entity265 , and was published by @entity266 , an imprint of @entity268			1
@entity265 claimed he saw it all and that he even witnessed ambassador @entity271 's dead body lying in a hospital bed			0
for a number of reasons , including the fact the book was being published by @entity1 's sister company , the program skipped its usual fact - checking procedures			2
according to @entity151 , @entity23 nor anyone else called the @entity282 or the @entity283 to check @entity265 ' claims before they went to air and the senior vice-president of standards and practices , @entity286 , who would have scrutinised the authenticity of the report , left in early 2013 and had n't been replaced			2
after much hype , the show was broadcast october 27 , and former @entity282 officials under @entity294 were immediately suspicious of @entity265 's account			0
' i think he 's lying his head off about where he was and what he did , ' a former official wrote in an email to a colleague while watching			0
' i mean , 14 months later we 're hearing about this guy for the first time ? ' soon after , the @entity306 revealed @entity265 had told his own firm , @entity307 , a contrary story			0
from there , it escalated			0
@entity268 pulled the book from the shelves early november			0
after defending the report , finally the evidence was overwhelming and @entity23 was forced to admit ' we were wrong ' on @entity316			2
@entity23 and @entity112 were both put on an indefinite leave of absence , as @entity1 scrambled to salvage the long - running program 's reputation			1
@entity169 reportedly refused to fire @entity23 and said at the time that she would return to the programme sometime this year			2
but @entity9 reports that the atmosphere is toxic within the network at the moment , and , as the months roll by , the date of @entity23 's return remains uncertain			1
@entity1 declined to comment to @entity327 .			0
