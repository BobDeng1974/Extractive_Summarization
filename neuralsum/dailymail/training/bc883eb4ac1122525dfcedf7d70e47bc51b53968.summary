by @entity0 probe : @entity3 's @entity2 boss @entity1 was caught on camera having sex with his @entity2 girlfriend a covert sex tape involving a senior executive and his @entity2 lover was the trigger for a major investigation into corruption at @entity14 drugs giant @entity3 , it was revealed yesterday			1
the video of married @entity1 and his girlfriend was filmed by secret camera and emailed anonymously to board members of the pharmaceutical firm			2
it led to an investigation that has rocked the £ 76billion company – which stands accused of bribing doctors and other health officials in @entity2 with £ 320million of gifts , including sexual favours from prostitutes , to persuade them to prescribe its drugs			2
mr @entity1 , who ran the company ’s @entity2 business , was charged six weeks ago with running a ‘ massive bribery network ’ involving £ 90million of illegal sales and banned from leaving the country			1
it was the culmination of a year - long corruption investigation into the @entity38 firm			0
but yesterday , it was revealed the scandal first erupted after the sex tape was emailed by ‘ @entity3 whistleblower ’ to board members , including chief executive @entity44 , in march 2013 , in what was believed to be a threat or blackmail attempt			1
the footage showed father - of - two mr @entity1 , who is separated from his wife , having sex with his @entity2 girlfriend			1
he was given permission to hire investigator @entity53 , 58 , to find out who had hidden the camera in his @entity57 flat and who had sent two separate emails making serious fraud allegations			2
the £ 20,000 probe , codenamed @entity62 , focused on disgruntled former employee @entity63 , 49 , a prominent businesswoman whose family is part of @entity57 ’s communist elite			0
but a few months after starting to investigate miss @entity63 , mr @entity53 was arrested along with his wife @entity68 , a @entity69 citizen and daughter of one of @entity2 ’s most eminent atomic weapons scientists			2
according to the @entity75 , mr @entity53 ’s arrest and detention in july was at around the same time that @entity2 began a police probe into @entity3 ’s alleged bribery			1
mr @entity1 , 52 , of @entity79 , @entity80 , stepped down from his post as @entity2 manager soon after mr @entity53 ’s arrest but remains a @entity3 employee			1
he returned to @entity14 around the same time but voluntarily went back to @entity2 within days to assist police with their inquiries			0
he was charged in may this year and accused by police of presiding over a web of corruption and pressing his sales teams to bribe health officials to meet targets			0
if found guilty , mr @entity1 , who has a phd in pharmacology and neurosciences from @entity96 , could face life in prison			1
mr @entity1 joined @entity3 in 1989 and has worked in @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity2			1
he is separated from @entity101 , 49 , with whom he has two teenage daughters , and has moved out of their £ 1.2million home			0
email : the footage was apparently sent to executives including chief executive @entity44 it is understood he met mrs @entity111 at university , where she was studying psychology			0
like her husband , she took up a post at @entity3 , working as a director of capital planning			0
yesterday , a neighbour said he did not know @entity1 and mrs @entity119 had split and said he had not seen either for months			0
the first email from ‘ @entity3 whistleblower ’ was sent in january last year			0
in march , the sex tape was sent from the same account , followed by a third email in may			2
the emails laid out a series of sales and marketing practices described as ‘ pervasive corruption ’			0
@entity3 launched an internal investigation but found ‘ no specific evidence ’ to substantiate the claims			0
however , the accusations are virtually identical to the charges laid by police against mr @entity1 and 45 other suspects			1
last month , @entity14 ’s @entity137 announced it is to investigate the company ’s ‘ commercial practices ’			0
yesterday , @entity3 confirmed the sex tape ’s existence and added in a statement : ‘ the issues relating to our @entity2 business are very difficult and complicated			1
the investigation by the @entity2 authorities remains ongoing and we are co-operating fully with this investigation			1

executives at @entity3 were sent a sex tape *featuring* @entity2 boss @entity1 and his girlfriend
they hired a private investigator to work out who had sent the video
but after he probed a *powerful* businesswoman , the @entity2 authorities *cracked* down on @entity3 amid allegations of fraud and bribery
mr @entity1 has been charged with illegally selling £ 90million worth of drugs
