@entity0 insists @entity1 must not get carried away following their 8 - 0 thrashing of @entity3			1
the 25 - year - old is currently on loan at @entity6 's from @entity7 and is now an integral part of the most miserly defence in @entity11 football			1
it was in attack where @entity1 made the headlines on saturday as they dished out a mauling to a @entity3 side who were simply blown away by the forward players on show for the hosts			1
@entity22 's @entity1 side continued their impressive run of form by crushing @entity3 8 - 0 the @entity3 did little to help their own cause as @entity26 hammered in an own goal that will live long in the memory to put @entity1 on their way to their biggest ever @entity31 win			1
player of the month @entity33 continued his impressive start to the campaign by tapping in a second before @entity37 added a third before half - time			2
a second own goal from substitute @entity40 made it four , then @entity33 completed a brace before @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 also got on the scoresheet			2
@entity3 were unfortunate not to be awarded a penalty at 2 - 0 when @entity47 came off his line and appeared to bring down @entity49 - although referee @entity50 was unmoved			1
@entity49 is closed down by @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 defender @entity0 the rout means @entity1 hold on to third spot in the @entity31 table with manager of the month @entity22 continuing his impressive start to life in @entity11 football			1
@entity61 are the next visitors to @entity6 's next weekend but @entity0 , who lifted the @entity63 title with @entity7 last season , knows the players need to remain grounded as they look to build on such a memorable result			1
' of course we can be very satisfied with the result , ' he said			0
' the second half was much better than the first but we have to keep calm			0
it is only three points and next week will be tough			0
' we can be happy but from tomorrow we have to be focused on saturday because it is a big day again			0
it can change very quickly in the @entity31			2
' @entity0 , on loan from @entity7 , warned his team - mates not to get carried away with the result the start to the season has seen @entity22 and his players defy the odds after it was suggested they would struggle having lost the likes of @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 over the summer			1
but in players like @entity0 , as well as @entity33 and @entity42 who both impressed once again on saturday , @entity22 has remodelled his squad into a side who look capable of continuing such form			1
@entity94 led @entity1 to a best - ever eighth place @entity31 finish last year before departing for @entity97 but @entity0 feels that can be beaten this year			1
' i think better than last season , ' the @entity103 international answered when asked what @entity1 should aim for this campaign			2
summer signing @entity42 jumps into the arms of @entity107 forward @entity33 after scoring his side 's sixth goal ' if we can make that step and finish in a better position that last season we can be happy			2
' i knew a lot of players that @entity22 brought and knew we had a good team			1
i signed here for a year to play good football and play with good players			0
@entity120 was replaced at half - time by @entity40 but had already seen enough to know that @entity3 were nowhere near good enough			1
although the 35 - year - old felt that @entity49 should have been awarded at 2 - 0 , the former @entity123 man confessed it would not have papered over the cracks			1
' we did n't manage to get the penalty and we are disappointed with that decision , ' he said			0
substitute @entity44 completes the rout by scoring his side 's eighth , and final , goal of the afternoon ' had that been given it might have changed the game , he could have been sent off too , especially if we had put the ball in the net from it			2
' it would have been 2 - 1 at the time			2
but it was not good enough today			0
there were not enough of us alive			0
to concede eight says it all really			0
' there were too many of us off our game			0
we might have had 10 minutes , but then they got a goal , got a second goal and a third			0
we needed to come out and show some fight and we did n't do that			0
' it has to be a one - off , you ca n't do that in the @entity31			1
you get punished like that if you do			0
we have to put this behind us as quickly as possible			0

@entity1 crushed @entity3 8 - 0 at @entity6 's
@entity0 warned team - mates not to get carried away
@entity22 's side are third in the @entity31
