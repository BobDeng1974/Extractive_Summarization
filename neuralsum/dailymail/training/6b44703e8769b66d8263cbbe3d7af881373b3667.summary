by @entity0 published : 04:13 est , 19 october 2012 updated : 08:05 est , 19 october 2012 a top barrister 's career was under threat today after she was convicted of assault for grabbing her misbehaving daughter 's hair			1
the woman , 47 , snapped after the 11 - year - old started hitting her and trashing their home during a row over a sleepover , @entity8 @entity7 heard			1
the youngster had earlier rung the police because she was furious at not being given money for a taxi to a friend ’s house			1
lashing out : the 47 - year - old snapped after the schoolgirl threw ironed washing down the stairs , slammed the door and hit her repeatedly with a jacket , @entity20 heard after officers came to the family home and told the girl off for the call , she began throwing clean and ironed washing down the stairs and repeatedly hitting her mother in the face with a jacket			1
the unruly schoolgirl then slammed the lounge door so heavily that a chair smashed into a wall and knocked over a shelf , spilling dvds and ornaments onto the floor			0
the lawyer , who has been both a prosecution and defence barrister for 17 years , eventually lost her temper			0
she lunged forward from her own chair and grabbed the child ’s shoulder - length hair , accidentally ripping out some strands , which were caught by her costume jewellery ring			1
today the barrister - who can not be named for legal reasons , to protect the identity of the child - was facing a disciplinary hearing before the @entity58 after she admitted assault at the @entity61 court			1
she sobbed as she was given a 12 - month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £ 85 costs			2
her counsel mr @entity64 told the court that it was the barrister 's birthday on the night of the assault earlier this month			1
turning to the law : police had come to the house earlier after the girl called them when her mother would not give her money for a taxi ( file picture ) mr @entity64 told the court : ' she had no plans to go out and celebrate			1
she had been drinking and perhaps it is fair to say that during the course of the evening , she drank a bit too much			2
' he said the daughter had ' a bit of a tantrum ' after returning from a friend 's house and was demanding to be given money to go back there by taxi			1
when she did n’t get any cash , the girl secretly rang the police			1
officers arrived and spoke to the mother and daughter before admonishing the daughter for calling them			2
mr @entity64 added : ' @entity69 clearly had no concerns about the daughter ’s welfare or the mother ’s level of intoxication before they left			0
' the solicitor said the girl continued to misbehave until the mother got out of her chair to stop her			2
job in jeopardy : the lawyer will now have to account for her actions in front of the @entity58 in @entity114 ( file picture ) he said : ' it 's against all this background , she accepts she lunged forward towards her daughter and she accepts she grabbed her daughter ’s shoulder - length hair			1
' it would appear she has pulled some hair from her daughter ’s scalp			0
it ’s believed a costume jewellery ring which she has on her finger caught on her daughter ’s hair , causing hair to get caught up in the ring and that was how the injury has occurred			1
' ' this was not a deliberate , intentional , malicious assault on her daughter			0
the mother was arrested , taken to the police station and interviewed and during the course of that interview , she expressed deep remorse and regret and she has asked me to apologise unreservedly to the court today			2
' she is well respected by her fellow practitioners and the judiciary			0
' there is no suggestion whatsoever that she is an unfit mother , quite the reverse			0
this is a tragedy for everybody , certainly for the girl and her mother			2
' this is an isolated incident , when a loving , caring mother pulled her daughter ’s hair in circumstances where , we would say , her daughter was behaving badly			2
' the court heard that the lawyer had informed the @entity58 about what had happened			0
her law chambers continue to support her and she will be travelling to @entity114 in the near future to account for her actions before the @entity58			0
mr @entity64 said : ' @entity168 will no doubt take a dim view of this matter and her ability to earn a living as a barrister may well be in jeopardy			0
this has been a very difficult case for the mother			0
these proceedings and the conviction today are significant punishment			0
' passing sentence , district judge @entity181 told the woman : ' this is a tragic case on many levels			0
