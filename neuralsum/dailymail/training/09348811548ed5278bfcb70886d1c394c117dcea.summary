@entity4 and @entity5 , both 47 , met when they found they were both married to bigamist @entity8 , 45			1
she is now out the picture - but their friendship has lasted in what they described as the ' only good thing ' to come out their ' hellish ' experience			0
her husbands could not contact each other before the trial was over due to the legal process – but when they met for a pint afterwards they struck up a close friendship			1
mr @entity4 , a former @entity27 serviceman , said : ' it might seem odd to some people that we get on so well			1
' but we have an ex-wife in common			0
we have had a shared experience too			0
she had us both under her spell and our close friendship is a result of that			2
' mr @entity5 , pictured after his wedding to @entity8 that took place at @entity24 , has since found a new partner mr @entity5 , pictured during happier times celebrating his 40th birthday , was smitten by @entity8 ( to his left ) when he first met her - but they split up when he found she was being deceptive about their finances mr @entity5 was immediately attracted to @entity8 ( far right ) , an area manager for a food company , but shortly after the wedding in september 2006 , cracks began to appear @entity5 , an area manager for a food company , had already been married and divorced when she met mr @entity5 , from @entity69 , in 2005			1
their relationship blossomed and they were married within a year			2
but shortly after the wedding , mr @entity5 starting having serious concerns when the joint bank account he shared with his wife frequently crept into its overdraft			1
just a year since they were married , mr @entity5 left his wife at their marital home in @entity69			1
six years later in 2012 @entity5 met mr @entity4 on a dating website – and he fell for her quickly , just like mr @entity5 had			1
in a similar way to mr @entity5 , he proposed quickly - within three and a half months			1
only seven months since meeting @entity5 , the couple were married at @entity32 's @entity31			2
but there was one serious hitch - although @entity5 was separated from mr @entity5 , she had never formally divorced him and so they were still legally married			1

devastated , he took a copy and left it on the kitchen table for his wife to find , before leaving their home in @entity69 - the same one she had shared with her former husband			0
he has since moved to @entity99			0
similarly to his friend mr @entity5 , mr @entity4 , from @entity99 , became so taken with @entity8 he proposed very quickly and the couple married in march this year at the @entity31 , in @entity32 the pair met on a dating site in april 2012 and got engaged four months later , before marrying last march he then contacted mr @entity104 to break the news to him			1
he said : ' i wanted him to know that i existed when i first found out			0
' so i let his solicitor know that @entity8 had remarried and was a bigamist			2
' he added : ' as soon as it was ­ discovered she was still married , our wedding became null and void			2
i 'm thankful she has no claim over my home or assets but the betrayal has shattered my confidence			0
' i do n't trust my own judgement anymore and i 'm off work with the stress of it all			0
' during her sentencing at @entity126 in june , mr @entity123 told her : ' it is rare for a case like this to come before the court , especially one involving a woman			0
' @entity132 is clearly a serious offence that strikes at the heart of the marriage system			0
' i have no doubt at all that you are a deceitful and dishonest woman and that mr @entity4 is the victim			2
' you cried during the course of this hearing , but i am by no means at all convinced that you are remorseful			0
' the pair have now struck up an unlikely friendship which they said was the ' only good thing ' to come out of the hellish experience the friends meet regularly for a beer and a game of pool in @entity150 , @entity151 - which is half way between their homes in @entity99 and @entity69 after she was jailed , mr @entity5 and mr @entity4 met to discuss their respective marriages to the bigamist			1
mr @entity4 said : ' after the trial we became quite friendly and had some long chats over the phone about what we 'd been through and the kind of woman she was			1
' after that it was pretty clear we had this bonding ­ experience and we were going to be mates for a long time			0
' his friendship is the only good thing to come out of this hell			0
' now the pair meet regularly for a beer and a game of pool			1
mr @entity5 said : ' it 's been almost seven years since i was in @entity8 's grip so i have moved on and found a new partner who i love and trust and that 's a whole different experience for me			1
' i look at @entity4 now and i can see his pain and anger and i 've been there too , so i can hopefully help him to move on past his upset			2
' but it is hard			0
you never get over the deception and feelings of being a fool			0
