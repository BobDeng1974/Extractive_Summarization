@entity0 , pictured appearing at @entity1 , to creating false references for doctors a recruitment consultant created fake references for foreign doctors in a ' potentially dangerous ' scam to secure them locum jobs at @entity10 hospitals			1
seven locum doctors were employed by @entity13 and @entity14 on the basis of @entity0 's misleading documents , a court heard			1
@entity0 , 34 , of @entity17 , south @entity18 , had altered the cvs and made up references after ' being drawn into a culture of deceit ' while working for @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity18			1
the scam was estimated to have cost the @entity26 £ 37,186			1
judge @entity27 told @entity28 : ' it is fortunate that there is no occasion where such lack of experience on behalf of one of these doctors impacted on the health of a patient			0
' but that was purely down to luck			2
' @entity0 pleaded guilty to 21 counts of making or supplying articles for use in fraud			1
he was sentenced to two years in prison , suspended for 12 months , to be served concurrently for each of the 21 counts			0
the judge said the case raised concerns about a lack of thorough checks by hospitals and gp surgeries into the backgrounds of their locum doctors			0
he said : ' the facts of this case reveal that some responsible @entity26 managers carried out proper checks on doctors and revealed this fraud			1
such managers are to be commended			0
' however , there are other instances where doctors were appointed where not only were cvs false but that references were given from fictitious persons - generally from imaginary consultants			1
' it appears therefore that over this period there were occasions where no proper check was made on important references			0
' if there was a company that was acting in this fraudulent and dangerous way , it is of considerable public interest as to what has been done since to ensure that patients are no longer put at risk of inexperienced doctors and under - qualified doctors and the @entity26 does not pay for doctors on such false basis			1
' the scam was discovered when a clinical services manager at @entity90 ( pictured ) noticed some discrepancies over the locum doctors ' cvs and references the scam was discovered when a clinical services manager at @entity90 and @entity96 who reported concerns about some locum doctors ' cvs and references to the @entity102			1
there is no evidence that patients had suffered clinically as a result of the fraud			2
@entity109 's fraud investigators searched @entity111 ' @entity24 premises in april 2010 , imaged computers and seized papers			0
when interviewed after his arrest , @entity0 admitted altering and falsifying applicants ' references as well as the ' @entity10 work experience ' sections of a number of their cvs , and supplying the false documents to trusts throughout the @entity10			1
forensic examination of the imaged computer equipment revealed faked reference letters within the cvs made use of at least eight false identities of medical consultants , either loosely based on real people or entirely made up			2
the manager who also covered @entity132 ( pictured ) reported concerns to the @entity102 who launched an investigation the doctors whose cvs were altered were qualified abroad and were unaware of the scam			1
judge @entity27 said he was concerned that no one else had been arrested in the case , despite the court hearing how @entity0 had carried out the fraud ' at the behest and encouragement ' of the company where he worked			2
@entity0 had worked for @entity111 between april 2009 and may 2010 where his main role was supposed to be placing adequately qualified and experienced doctors in @entity26 positions			1
@entity150 , mitigating , told the court previously that @entity0 had been drawn into a ' culture of deceit ' when he took a job at @entity155 , where there was an attitude of ' see no evil , hear no evil '			1
while working there , @entity0 adopted a pseudonym , as was practice in the office to pass problems on to a fictitious manager			2
the company also encouraged adding details of work in the @entity10 and qualifications that did not exist in the @entity10			0
the judge told the court : ' while the counts on the indictment enabled the agency to claim £ 37,000 in fees , the seriousness of this fraud is that doctors were being placed where their experience was less than claimed on their cvs			2
' when interviewed , mr @entity0 told police that this was the culture of this recruitment company			1
he was trained to carry out such a fraud from the very outset of his employment			0
' he was given a prepared script to use when calling locum @entity188 would be asked to email their genuine cvs			0
these cvs were then embellished to add bogus experience in an effort to make the doctor more attractive to the particular @entity14			0
@entity0 pleaded guilty at @entity1 ( pictured ) to 21 counts of making or supplying articles for use in fraud ' the management of @entity23 as it was operating in 2009/2010 , not only knew about his activity but were responsible for bringing it about			1
the benefits to the company were all too obvious			0
' the doctors were being paid as little as £ 15 per hour while the agency was charging up to £ 120 per hour for the services of these doctors			0
' the man that is in the dock is at the lowest end of responsibility for this criminal conduct			0
no - one else has , to my knowledge , even been arrested , let alone tried for this shameful practice			0
' the company is still trading in the same area under a different name , with a commonality of directors			0
@entity223 , @entity224 , @entity109 , said after the sentencing today : ' @entity0 's potentially dangerous deception has caught up with him			2
he abused a position of trust for his personal gain , seeming not to care about the potential consequences for patients of receiving treatment from medical staff whose experience did not meet the requirements of their job			0

@entity0 faked references and cvs at @entity23
seven doctors were employed at two @entity26 trusts on basis of documents
@entity246 said it was ' purely luck ' that no patients were harmed by the scam
@entity0 pleaded guilty to fraud and *blamed* a ' culture of deceit ' at @entity155
the recruitment consultant was handed a two - year suspended sentence
