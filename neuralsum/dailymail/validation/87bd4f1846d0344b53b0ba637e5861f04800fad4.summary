a wife gave her husband the gift of life for @entity4 by donating one of her kidneys			1

@entity10 and his dad had both initially been against @entity7 getting tested as they thought she was too young to give up a kidney			2
so @entity7 got tested in secret before convincing them to let her do it for the sake of the couple 's four - year - old son			2
she said : ' i actually got the results back saying that we were a match on @entity4 , which meant it was the perfect moment to make the offer to my husband and i was glad when he finally accepted			1

she was forced to leave her job so she could be closer to where her husband 's mother was being treated			0
@entity10 's mother died two years later			0
' i quit my job after my mother - in - law got sick			0
i sold egg pancakes on the street in the day then went back to work in the shop , ' said @entity82 initially , @entity7 was embarrassed to sell food on the streets so would cover her face with a dust mask			0

worried : @entity10 looks anxious before his life - saving surgery while @entity7 's mother ( right ) waits nervously outside her room recovering : @entity7 gives the thumbs up sign after successful surgery to remove her kidney she said : ' at the time , we owed other people 200,000 - 300,000 yuan ( £ 32,000 )			1
