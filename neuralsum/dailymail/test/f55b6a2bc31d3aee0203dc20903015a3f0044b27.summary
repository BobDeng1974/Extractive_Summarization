@entity1 defender @entity0 insists a ' sad ' @entity2 will deal with the reality of being denied a fairytale fa cup final farewell			1
the former @entity6 international said the team was probably more disappointed at not being able to deliver a trophy for fans , who this season had seen their side fail to progress out of the @entity13 group stage and lose to @entity14 in the last four of the @entity15			1
a 2 - 1 defeat to @entity17 at @entity18 ended the club 's last hope of silverware and meant @entity2 would not be given a perfect send off ahead of his summer move to @entity23 with a cup final appearance on his 35th birthday on what would have been his very last for his boyhood club			1
@entity0 ( left ) admitted @entity2 was ' sad ' after the loss but he also felt sorry for @entity1 's fans ' you feel bad			1
it is always difficult when you lose a semi-final like that , ' @entity0 told @entity34			2
' the defeat is the thing			2
of course we wanted to do very well for the last game of @entity39 for the club but at the end of the day , we wanted to do it for the fans because this club deserves to have a trophy			2
' he ( @entity2 ) is fine			2
of course he is sad , like all the dressing room , but he has been in this game for a long time and he knows how to deal with these situations			0
' @entity2 was able to start the match after an injury to @entity53 in training , which denied @entity1 some much - needed control in midfield			1
the former @entity58 captain looks dejected after the final whistle and his hopes of a final trophy ended however , @entity0 insisted they should have had the ability to cope without their only genuine defensive midfielder			1
' @entity53 is a great player but we had players who could do the job , ' he added			0
' collectively we were not very good			0
@entity17 really fought and gave everything to win the game			2
' as a result , @entity71 became the first @entity1 manager since the 1950s not to win a trophy in his first three years			1
@entity2 did n't get his fairytale ending at @entity18 as he leaves the club at the end of the season for @entity23 with the club 's @entity13 qualification hopes looking increasingly distant after @entity82 's win over @entity83 on sunday increased the gap to fourth place to seven points - although @entity1 now have a match in hand - the @entity89 boss will find his record coming under more scrutiny over the final six games of the season			1
the @entity93 insists he and his players will not give up while there is still a mathematical possibility			0
' there 's an obligation here to fight to the very end , ' he said			0
' we have to fight in every single game now			0
of course there will be disappointment over the next couple of days but we 're going to have to get ready			0
' @entity71 became the first manager since the 1950s not to win a trophy in his first three years despite an impressive run of form since the turn of the year , @entity1 have looked ineffective in the big games , with back - to - back defeats to @entity113 and @entity114 putting a huge dent in their top - four hopes just when it seemed they were about to make the breakthrough , having worked so hard to get within two points of the top - four			1
' the start of the season was not so good for various reasons then we picked it up , ' said @entity71			0
' we played very well and had great rhythm to our game then we 've had a block of games where the performance level has n't been what we 'd like			0
' the team in the last couple of years have shown great energy , attitude and commitment - i thought our energy was low ( against @entity17 )			1
the @entity89 boss admitted that @entity17 deserved the victory as they progressed to the @entity140 final ' they had a good start to the game and we were too passive in the game			1
' we changed the system , got some joy and got in front but we did n't keep the lead long enough			0
' in the second half we hoped to play better but we just did n't create enough			0
' we needed to change the game to get more thrust going forward but even then the numbers getting forward were n't what we 're normally used to			0
