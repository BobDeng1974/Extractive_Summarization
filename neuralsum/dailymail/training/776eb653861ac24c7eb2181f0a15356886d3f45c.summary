he then burnt the child 's abdomen with the hot knife over 40 times , convinced it would cure her illness			1
however , @entity21 's situation only got worse			2

' @entity21 and @entity109 hail from a primitive tribal community , called @entity111 , in @entity51			0
they still believe in tantric or local healers for their medical problems , who carry out branding as a common treatment			1
dr @entity73 said branding is prevalent in remote villages dominated by @entity111 and though painful , people willingly go for it because they have little or no faith in medical doctors			1
he said he sees two or three cases of branded patients every year			2
he said : ' it is disturbing that tribal families still believe they would be cured with burns to their bodies			0
' but i can not blame them			0
they are illiterate and not informed about medical science , they do n't understand			0

this practice is still very much seen in villages in @entity1			2
various body parts are branded for different diseases : the abdomen for malaria and jaundice , the neck or the forehead for meningitis and the wrist for convulsions			0
the red rod is just one of the instruments used , others include burning ropes and metal rings			0
these ancient methods are crude and inhumane , causing the treatment to be more unbearable than the original complaint and even carrying the risk of complications			0
these include acute infection , transmission of blood - borne pathogens , allergic reactions , and complications which arise from third - degree burns			2
the practice of putting saliva , ash or herbal paste on the burn wounds adds to the disease			0
