by @entity0 according to a leading psychiatrist , parents should avoid being ‘ tigers ’ , at no point become ‘ jellyfish ’ and do their best to raise their offspring as though they were a ‘ dolphin ’			0
this might sound bafflingly irrelevant to the daily grind of the school run , but mother - of - three dr @entity11 believes children of micromanaging tiger parents risk suffering from anxiety and depression			1
mother - of - three dr @entity11 claims ‘ tiger ’ parents - who ‘ overparent ’ and micromanage their children ’s lives in a bid to achieve excellence – end up removing their child ’s sense of internal control and self - motivation			1
according to psychiatrist dr @entity11 , parents should neither become ' jellyfish ' - who bring children up to lack self - control - nor ' tigers ' , who ' overparent ' and micromanage their children 's lives at the other end of the spectrum , permissive ' jellyfish ' parents raise children who lack self - control and have poor social skills			1
however dolphin parents have rules and expectations , but value creativity and independence			1
the doctor , whose book , @entity51 , is published this month , said this type of parenting has two distinct parts			0
‘ the first is a balanced , authoritative parent - child relationship , ’ she said			0
parents should do their best to raise their offspring as though they were a ' dolphin ' because those parents apparently have rules and expectations - but also value creativity and independence ‘ the second is a balanced lifestyle , including what many of today ’s kids are missing – play and exploration , a sense of community and contribution , and the basics of regular sleep , exercise and rest			2
‘ parents must stop over-scheduling , overprotecting and being over-competitive to allow their children the time and space to activate their own intrinsic motivators			0
’ dr @entity81 , who trained at @entity82 , said children of tiger parents are at higher risk of anxiety , depression , entitlement , poor decision - making , and difficulty establishing healthy independence			2
children of jellyfish parents may turn to peers for guidance and fail to develop self - control			0
‘ they ( children of jellyfish parents ) are at higher risk of poor social skills , risk - taking behaviours , and substance use , ' she said			1
‘ many modern parents flip - flop between tiger and jellyfish leaving their child with no consistent message			0

dr @entity11 says ' dolphin ' parents have rules but also value independence
' @entity117 ' parents raise children with poor social skills who lack self control
' @entity124 ' parents are too *restrictive* and micromanage their children
