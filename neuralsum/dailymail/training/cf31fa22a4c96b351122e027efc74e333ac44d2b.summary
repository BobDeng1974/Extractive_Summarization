by @entity1 reporter published : 11:05 est , 30 september 2013 updated : 11:08 est , 30 september 2013 when @entity3 founded @entity5 airlines in 1999 , he sought to ‘ bring humanity back to travel ’ with a classless seating structure			0
but now the airline seems to be going against it ’s mission by unveiling today the new ' @entity12 ' class – a first - class section set to debut next year on flights between @entity15 and @entity16 and @entity15 and @entity17			1
the new section will feature lie - back seats , customized amentities kits and a tapas - style inflight menu in an attempt to attract a higher - paying clientele who would n't normally fly the budget airline cross-country			1
‘ this is seismic because now … @entity5 is saying some passengers are going to be more important that others , ’ @entity37 , a travel analyst with @entity39 , told @entity40			0
‘ this move is not one that comes with guaranteed success , nor is it one that comes without risk to the brand			0
there is a chance that some customers may look at this and say @entity5 is selling out			0
’ but the company defends it ’s position to shake up the seating structure			0
@entity5 ceo @entity54 says @entity12 was a response to the customers they were losing to @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 – airlines that offer premium cabin experiences			2
coming soon : the move has come as a surprise to some industry experts , since the brand prides itself on treating passengers equally @entity54 is confident the new class wo n’t be re-creating the brand since coach will be getting upgrades as well			2
the first flight with the new @entity12 section will take off from @entity74 on june 15 , 2014 en route to @entity16			1
the new section will feature ‘ suites ’ with lie - flat suites which have their own door for privacy			1
the new seats will be the longest and widest on domestic flights			0
before take - off , those in @entity12 will be offered a drink and once in the air , they can have a cocktail and hors d'oeuvre			1
from there , passengers may choose to watch tv from their own personal 15 - inch flatscreen , or perhaps take a nap			1
there ’s a button they can press to notify flight attendants if they want to be awakened for a meal			2
perfect for snoozing : the new ' @entity12 ' class will have lie - back seats for passengers to take a nap on the long cross-country flight the meal itself will be a tapas - style menu , and passengers can choose from three of the five available plates			1
other features include an in - flight amenities box by @entity112 , with different boxes for male and female passengers			1
products can be used in - flight , but some of the gifts are meant to be taken home like lotion and shampoo samples			1
perhaps to make up for the massive upgrades in first - class , those flying in coach will also be getting an upgrade next year			2
‘ we wanted to make sure everyone on the airplane got an upgrade , ’ said @entity127 , @entity5 ’s senior vice president of marketing and commercial strategy			0
‘ we wanted to make sure our core customer did n’t think we were walking away from them			0
privacy : mint passengers have their own door they can close for privacy and a button that signals flight attendants they want to be awakened for a meal so coach will get a whole lot comfier with softer and roomier seats , even though the airline already offers more room in coach than any other domestic airline			1
on the flights with the new mint class , those in coach will be able to help themselves to a new self - service snack bar where they can get free soft drinks and munchies			1
other upgrades include power outlets at every seat , an increase from 36 to 100 channels of live tv , and free inflight @entity163			2
while not every passenger will be equal on @entity5 flights next year , @entity164 of @entity165 thinks customers will respond well to the improvements			0
‘ it ’s certainly not a revolution			0
it ’s only limited to these routes			0
i think they ’re very aware of what they stand for and are very true to their brand , so in no way does this in my mind take away from the experience in the back			0

new ' @entity12 ' class will be offered on the @entity15 to @entity16 and @entity15 to @entity17 routes early next *summer*
the new class will feature lie - back seats , a personal 15 - inch television and a door for privacy
other features include a tapas - style in - flight meal and a customized amenities kit
to soften the blow to coach customers , those in the back of the plane will also be getting upgrades
coach upgrades include softer and roomier seats and a new self - service snack bar
