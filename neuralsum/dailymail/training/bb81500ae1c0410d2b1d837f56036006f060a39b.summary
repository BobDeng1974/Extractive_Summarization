by @entity0 published : 06:01 est , 5 march 2013 updated : 09:54 est , 5 march 2013 @entity2 ’s first ever hybrid was launched today as the company proves that environmental technology can still provide the speed - seeking thrills of a supercar			1
the new lightning - fast car called @entity9 - or ‘ the @entity2 ’ – is the fastest car the company has ever built , and will have a £ 1million price tag			1
it has an electric motor linked to a 6.3 litre petrol engine that propels it from rest to 62mph in under three seconds and to 124mph in under seven seconds			1
the company said that @entity9 , which made its world debut at today ’s @entity30 , is the fastest car in @entity33 ’s history and ‘ the first hybrid in @entity2 history			1
’ ‘ all in all the car guarantees maximum driving thrills , ’ said a @entity2 spokesman			0
‘ the @entity9 ’s body has been given a sculptural treatment heavily influenced by its aerodynamics			2
’ built for thrills , @entity9 emits 330 g / km of @entity43 , which though low by supercar standards , is still much higher than an average hybrid car			2
striking : the car 's design includes chairs that are moulded to the drivers body fast : lap tests showed that @entity9 is faster than the iconic @entity26 the congestion charge exempt @entity51 costs £ 21,600 and has co2 emissions are much lower at just 89g/km , it qualifies for exemption from the @entity56 congestion charge and does 72 miles to the gallon			1
@entity2 ‘ @entity9 ’ @entity58 : £ 1million type : petrol - electric hybrid			1
built : @entity33 , @entity61			0
production run : limited to an exclusive 499 length ; 15ft 5 inches width : 6ft 6 inches height : 3ft 8 inches weight : 1.365 tonnes petrol engine : 6.3 litre @entity68 and 800 horse - power electric motor : 120 kilowatt and 163 horsepower			1
total power : 963 horsepower - equivalent to nearly 10 @entity72			1
@entity73 : 17 to 20 mpg ( estimated ) top speed : more than 220mph 0 - 62mph : under 3seconds 0 - 124 : under 7 seconds co2 emissions : 330g/km lap time @entity23 circuit : under 1min 20s to save weight the seats are fixed and moulded to the individual driver following a ‘ bespoke fitting ’			1
instead it is the pedals and steering wheel which are adjustable			0
so if you sell the car , @entity2 will have to mould a new bespoke seat for the new owner			0
the driving position is similar to that of a single - seater f1 car and was designed after consultation with the @entity2 drivers @entity95 and @entity97 , who both played an active role throughout the entire development process			2
weight from the system is kept low and between the car ’s two axles as close as possible to the floor to lower its centre of gravity by just over an inch to boost dynamic handling and help keep the car as compact as possible			0
the chassis has four different types of carbon - fibre , all hand - laminated and cured in an oven in the racing department using the same design and production methods as the @entity118 car			2
the seats and the battery compartment were integrated into the chassis to improve the car ’s rigidity and cut weight			0
it is powered by @entity2 ’s hybrid petrol - electric energy recovery system called ‘ @entity127			2
’ the powerful 6.3 litre @entity68 horse - power engine is coupled with a 120 kw electric motor with power equivalent to about 40 electric kettles , as much horsepower as a family saloon			1
together this gives the @entity9 a combined power output of 963 horsepower – equivalent to nearly ten @entity72 - to drive the wheels			1
the electric motor is coupled with the @entity118 derived dual - clutch gearbox so that power is instantly available to the wheels during acceleration and from the wheels to the electric motor during recharging			2
electric : the engine is a combination of a 120kw electric motor and a 6.3litre petrol engine iconic : the company believe this hybrid is as thrilling as a normal supercar a computerised engine management system controls the relative flow of petrol and electric power			1
a second electric motor powers ancillaries such as air conditioning			2
the thin battery pack weighing 60kg covers most of the cabin under - floor area and is attached to the chassis beneath the driver and passenger to keep the centre of gravity low			0
the batteries are charged in two different ways			0
firstly energy generated from braking is collected			0
secondly energy is collected every time the engine produces more torque or ‘ puling power ’ than is needed - such as in cornering			0
instead of being sent to the wheels , the excess power is converted to energy and stored in the batteries			0
an aerodynamic guide vane on the rear spoiler generates downforce to keep the car gripping the road – and prevent it taking flight			0
an on board computer electronically measures the car and the driver ’s actions to optimise performance .			0

the £ 1million @entity9 is the company 's first ever hybrid supercar
it can reach 62mph in under three seconds and has a top speed of 220mph
it is faster than the iconic @entity26 and @entity27
the car uses a 6.3litre engine and *120kilowatt* electric motor
it has a total of 963 horsepower - equivalent to 10 @entity72
