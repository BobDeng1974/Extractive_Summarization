‘ it 's quite a tricky thing because you guys are quite intimidating , ’ he said			1
‘ obviously if there are people who are politically against it , that is quite intimidating			1

i 'm running for office in 2020 so i am more up to speed on this , but it 's a tricky old thing			1
’ he said he remains ‘ positive ’ about the @entity2 people and its @entity36 , which he thinks should have as many powers as @entity2 want it to have			2

‘ it was n't me , an @entity0 , saying look there 's a @entity53 , ’ he said			2
‘ it was just that we are @entity17 , and he was winning , and it was us , and i think that is beautiful			2
‘ if you look back at the history of what used to happen between the @entity2 and the @entity61 , the war and the blood and the death , i think it is beautiful that we have got to this position of being together			2
' the event marked a stepping up of the @entity10 campaign after polls narrowed in recent days @entity0 joined activists making telephone calls to undecided @entity2 referendum voters at @entity73 part of @entity74 @entity0 went on : ‘ i am an @entity0 called @entity75 , and there are a few @entity77 that have had a history at @entity80 and in the @entity82 film			1

i ran to the top of @entity86 here in @entity22 , and i 've also played nearly every major town and city in @entity2 up to and including @entity90			1

‘ you 've got to realise that i am transvestite so i 've already had a lot of negative things said to me over the years in the street , so nothing in politics can happen which is worse than that , ’ he said , bearing his nails painted with the @entity17 and @entity110 flags			2
‘ it 's a political statement , @entity17 @entity110 transvestite , and if you 're a @entity2 transvestite you can have the same nails and it will still work			2

@entity125 said : ‘ the referendum is a serious issue but that does n't mean we ca n't make jokes about it			0
‘ with months of campaigning behind us and five months still to go , it 's easy to lose track of the issues as each side goes over them again and again and again			0
‘ a good joke is like a firework			0
it cuts through everything and makes even the most jaded sit up and listen			0
‘ the referendum is a decision for the people of @entity2 but its impact does n't stop at @entity149			0
‘ it 's right that people in the rest of the @entity17 make their feelings known			0
‘ they might not have a vote but they have a voice and it should be heard			0
’ families and businesses would face soaring costs in an independent @entity2 regardless of what currency is adopted , it was warned yesterday			0
new research by one of the country 's largest firms yesterday cast severe doubt on the @entity167 's plans for separation and predicts rising costs , higher taxes and deep public spending cuts			0
a three - month study commissioned by @entity173 from experts at @entity175 said the economy ' could succeed ' after the referendum in the event of a @entity180 vote , but it could take around 15 years to achieve			1
it added that whatever currency is used , @entity2 companies are ' likely to face higher funding costs post-independence '			0
changing currency could mean ' substantial one - off costs for business , amounting to around £ 800million '			0
this is along with ' ongoing transaction costs on businesses and households of around £ 500million per year '			0
but it added that even if a currency union with the @entity17 is agreed , it would lead to either higher taxes or public spending cuts of around £ 9billion a year to meet strict debt ratio requirements			0
@entity173 is the latest in a number of huge employers - including @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity202 and @entity203 - who have raised concerns about the economic impact of separation			1

@entity173 chief executive @entity214 said : ' as a political document , the @entity216 's @entity215 paints a picture of independence as being a risk - free option with only potential benefits			1
' however , voters should be aware that what they are being asked to say yes to carries substantial risks to our economy and therefore to the quality of life of millions of people			0
the costs of independence are guaranteed but the benefits are uncertain			0
' deputy first minister @entity233 said : ' the @entity173 is an important company in @entity2			1
i actually welcome their contribution to the debate			0
' i am looking forward early next month to meeting senior management and staff to discuss these very issues and i hope to reassure them on some of the points they have made			0
' @entity244 leader @entity243 said that with some of @entity2 's biggest employers raising ' legitimate concerns ' about the economic impact of independence ' the @entity167 can no longer be so dismissive over their warnings '			0
former chancellor @entity98 , leader of the @entity251 campaign , said : ' yet again , it is clear from a company employing hundreds of @entity2 that being part of the @entity17 is good for jobs here and it keeps down costs for families in @entity2			1
