if recent pictures are anything to go by , @entity0 and @entity1 are set to become pop 's biggest power couple			1
after a month of rumours about a possible romance , the twosome were spotted hanging out in @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 earlier this week			1
but if 31 - year - old @entity13 is to become the new mr @entity0 then he should be aware that he might end up becoming the subject of one of her songs			1
@entity0 herself even admits that her relationships do inspire her musically			1
however , she 's always careful not to go into specifics			2
she once said : ' for me , i have a really strict personal policy that i never name names			2
so anybody saying that a song is about a specific person is purely speculating			2
and they ’re going to do that			2
' here we look back over her previous relationships ... and the songs they were thought to have inspired			2
@entity0 dated @entity24 in 2008 and is thought to have written several songs about him after he dumped her over the phone @entity24 @entity0 and @entity24 dated in 2008 and it 's thought that he inspired her whole @entity49 album			1
' @entity52 and ' @entity51 , ' were thought to have been about their messy split			2
@entity0 previously revealed that @entity24 dumped her in a 27 second long phone call , but he countered her claims saying he would have spoken for longer had she not hung up on him			1
@entity24 actually wrote an open letter about the situation saying : ' for those who have expressed concern over the ’ 27 - second ’ phone call … i called to discuss feelings with the other person			1
' those feelings were obviously not well - received			2
i did not end the conversation			0
' phone calls can only last as long as the person on the other end of the line is willing to talk			0
a phone call can be pretty short when someone else ends the call			0
' the only difference in this conversation was that i shared something the other person did not want to hear			0
there were later attempts at communication that had no response			0
' @entity0 broke her promise not to name and shame when she wrote her hit song @entity87 about her ex @entity22 @entity22 @entity0 was n't exactly subtle when she wrote about fellow singer @entity22 who she dated briefly in 2009			1
she called the song ' @entity87 ' and she did n't hold back in expressing her feelings for the man who went on to date both @entity94 and @entity93			0
some of the lyrics to the song include : ' you paint me a blue sky			0
and go back and turn it to rain			0
and i lived in your chess game			0
but you changed the rules everyday			0
' @entity0 also references the fact that she was too young ( at the time she was only 19 ) to be caught up with an older man			1
@entity87 , now 37 , has since said that he did n't feel he deserved to have such a harsh song written about him			0
telling @entity110 : ' it made me feel terrible , because i did n't deserve it			0
' i 'm pretty good at taking accountability now and i never did anything to deserve that			0
it was a really lousy thing for her to do			0
' @entity0 dated @entity117 in 2009 and is thought to have written back to december to apologise to the actor having dumped him @entity117 @entity0 and @entity119 dated in 2009 and starred in the film @entity120 together			1
and the actor then became the subject of her song , ' back to december			0
' in the lyrics @entity0 reveals how she dumped a boyfriend - thought to be mr @entity117 - and left the roses that he 'd given her to die			1
@entity0 never actually admitted to having dated the actor however , when she was quizzed about their romance on the @entity132 she remained particularly coy on the subject			1
@entity0 and @entity134 may have looked like the perfect all @entity136 couple but in fact they split after just a few months of dating @entity134 @entity134 and @entity0 enjoyed a four month romance at the end of 2010 going into 2011 and she wrote ' @entity143 , ' about him			1
@entity0 said of the song : ' [ it ] is about an experience i had with someone who was kind of this unreliable guy			1
' you never know when he 's going to leave , you never know when he 's going to come back , but he always does come back			0
' it is also thought that she wrote ' @entity152 , ' about the actor			2
in the lyrics of the song she references how she left her scarf at his sisters house			0
when @entity134 and @entity0 went out it was widely reported that the pair had spent time with his sibling @entity162 who the popstar got on well with			1
@entity0 dated @entity164 in 2012 and speaks favourably about their relationship in @entity167 @entity164 @entity0 went out with @entity164 - a descendant of the late @entity168 - in 2012 and it 's thought she wrote the song @entity167 about him			1
@entity0 said of the song : ' [ it is ] when you 've gotten through a really bad relationship and you finally dust yourself off			2
' the pair only lasted a few months with @entity0 admitting just before they split that she perhaps did n't know that much about love			1
she said in an interview : ' i do n't know how to have a normal relationship because i try to act normal , love from a normal place and live a normal life			0
but there is sort of an abnormal magnifying glass , like telescope lens , on everything that happens between me and anybody else			0
' i do n't really know that much about love , it turns out			0
' one of @entity0 's most high profile relationships was with @entity23 who she is thought to have written two songs about @entity199 & @entity200 sold out ! shop the designer at @entity202 visit site this is the @entity0 sweater that launched a thousand imitations			1
back when she was still dating 1direction singer @entity23 , @entity0 wore this @entity209 sweater featuring a fox , and suddenly everyone in the world was clamoring to get one			1
@entity0 is constantly setting fashion trends no matter what she 's wearing			2
the pop star 's preppy , buttoned - up style is a favorite both with her tween fans and their moms			0
this sweater is a perfect example of @entity0 's cute and kitschy taste applied to tasteful and modest items of clothing			2
of course , considering the major fox mania , this sweater has been totally sold out for awhile now , though you can snap up some similar items from the brand with a click to the left			0
if you have to have this foxy little piece of knitwear right now , we 've got some picks in the edit below that are the spitting image ! @entity243 ( now on sale for $ 369.99 ! ) at @entity245 visit site @entity247 ( now on sale for $ 239.20 ! ) at the @entity248 visit site forever 21 @entity250 visit site @entity252 ( now on sale for $ 64 ! ) visit site @entity23 given that @entity23 and @entity0 actually only dated for about two and a half months she has got quite a lot of mileage out of their union			1
@entity0 is thought to have written two songs about @entity261 : ' i knew you were trouble , ' from her red album and ' @entity265 , ' from 1989			1
@entity265 references the fact that the pair went on a skiing holiday during their brief romance which started in december 2012			2
@entity23 said of @entity0 writing about him : ' i think we always say , when we [ @entity272 ] wrote the album , that we write from personal experiences , so it would be hypocritical of us to be like “ oh you ca n’t write a song			1
' she ’s really good so … they ’re good songs			0
so i ’m lucky in that sense			0
' @entity0 herself has never actually confirmed the songs were about the one @entity284 singer .			1
