a rapid shift to wind and solar power is needed if the world is to avoid catastrophic global warming , the @entity5 warns in a crucial report today			1
emissions of greenhouse gases need to be cut by up to 70 per cent before 2050 to control climate change , the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) says			1
‘ large - scale changes in energy systems ’ are required , with coal power stations to be switched off and replaced by wind and solar			1
@entity16 refers to the process of capturing carbon released by burning fossil fuels and storing it in porous rock layers in areas such as depleted oil and gas reservoirs and the transformation needs to be made in the next 15 years or controlling climate change will become increasingly harder and more expensive			1
the report was published in @entity29 today after a week of line - by - line drafting and re-drafting			2
the final version , written by 235 international scientists and economists , says that efforts so far have failed to stop spiralling emissions of greenhouse gases – which have risen to ‘ unprecedented levels ’ in the past decade			1
@entity38 , co-chair of the authors , said : ‘ there is a clear message from science : to avoid dangerous interference with the climate system , we need to move away from business as usual			0
’ the @entity7 report is the first major assessment in seven years of the options for dealing with climate change			1
it will inform the policy decisions of governments around the world , and vitally , will also be used as bargaining tool before next year ’s @entity5 climate conference in @entity57 , which aims to set legally binding targets on every nation to reduce carbon emissions			1
it is the final part in a trilogy of @entity7 reports on the causes , impacts and solutions to climate change			0
the first part , published last september , found that scientists are 95 per cent certain that humans are the ‘ dominant cause ’ of global warming			2
the second part , published a fortnight ago , warned that the drastic impacts of climate change are ‘ already occurring on all continents and across the oceans ’			2
the final part , published today on the options for mitigating global warming , warns that we must drastically reduce our use of fossil fuels			1
the report warns : ‘ without additional efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions beyond those in place today , emissions growth is expected to persist driven by growth in global population and economic activities			1
’ if no action is taken , global temperatures will rise by up to @entity92 by the end of the century , which scientists believe will cause irreversible and dramatic damage to the planet			0
global investment in fossil fuels will have to drop by £ 20billion a year until 2030 , while world investment in low - carbon alternatives will have to rise by £ 90billion a year			1
last year in @entity102 fossil fuels provided 65 per cent of electricity , with nuclear providing 20 per cent and renewable sources providing 15 per cent			1
the scientists are optimistic that if renewable energy is quickly rolled out , homes are built in a more sustainable and energy efficient way , and human consumption and wastefulness is changed , climate change can be controlled			0
transforming the economy will require ‘ substantial investment ’ – up to 4 per cent of total global gdp between now and 2030			2
but the report authors argue that money would need to be spent on energy infrastructure anyway , and the additional spend will only slow growth by a tiny amount , no more than 0.14 of a percentage point			2
renewable energy has already started to expand , the report finds , but a rapid acceleration is now needed			2
‘ regarding electricity generation alone , renewable energy accounted for just over half of the new electricity ‐ generating capacity added globally in 2012 , led by growth in wind , hydro and solar power , ’ it says			0
but it warns that @entity137 will still need to pour subsidies in to get the systems off the ground			2
green power : the report , by the @entity5 's @entity7 ( @entity7 ) , also highlights an urgent need for governments to switch to green energy , such as wind ( pictured ) and solar power ‘ many renewable energy technologies still need direct and / or indirect support , if their market shares are to be significantly increased , ’ it says			1
despite the focus on renewable energy , the scientists say natural gas still has a role to play for electricity production in a low - carbon world			0
the assessment is an unexpected endorsement of the @entity162 ’s drive to frack for shale gas , and a blow to the green lobby which opposes it			0
the report says burning natural gas is a far cleaner method of energy production than burning coal			1
gas will act as a ‘ bridge technology ’ while renewable energy is expanded , a phase that could last until 2050			2
beyond that it would be phased out – but may still play a role if carbon dioxide emissions could be trapped and stored underground			0
the report says : ‘ greenhouse gas emissions from energy supply can be reduced significantly by replacing current world average coal ‐ fired power plants with modern , highly efficient natural gas combined ‐ cycle power plants or combined heat and power plants , provided that natural gas is available and the fugitive emissions associated with extraction and supply are low or mitigated			1
’ nuclear power could make an ‘ increasing contribution to low - carbon energy supply ’ , the report finds , but the scientists warn that ‘ operation risks ’ such as disposing of radioactive waste mean there are a ‘ variety of barriers and risks ’			0
the scientists also suggest that an experimental technology could be used to ‘ suck ’ carbon dioxide out of the air , as a last - ditch ‘ @entity209 ’ if emissions are not cut in time			1
the technology would work by using a little - tested system called @entity212 – bio-energy with @entity16			0
it would involve growing crops that absorb co2 from the atmosphere then burn them in a power station to generate energy			0
the resulting emissions would then be captured at the plant and then stored underground			0
the net effect of that process would result in @entity216 is removed from the air			0
professor @entity38 , of the @entity226 , said : ‘ many different pathways lead to a future within the boundaries set by the @entity231 goal [ beyond which global warming becomes difficult to control			0
‘ all of these require substantial investments			0
avoiding further delays in mitigation and making use of a broad variety of technologies can limit the associated costs			0

governments need to ditch fossil fuels , like coal and oil , says @entity5 report
emissions of greenhouse gases ' need to fall 70 per cent by 2050 '
the report warns that the drastic changes should be made within 15 years
