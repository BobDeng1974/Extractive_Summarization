by @entity1 reporter we eat there , we buy our clothes there , and some people suspect teenagers may actually live there			1
so perhaps it was just a matter of time until funeral homes began popping up in shopping malls			1
over the past two years , @entity13 has been quietly putting movable kiosks in several of the malls that dot @entity17 's suburbs			1
the move , by one of the funeral industry 's best - known operators , expands on a marketing innovation that appears to have begun at the dawn of the decade , when a company called @entity26 began opening casket stores around the country			1
' we try to reach our audience where they are at , and the mall is a great way to do that , ' said @entity35 , spokesman for @entity13 , whose cemeteries count among their permanent residents such notables as @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41			0
impulse purchase : @entity45 and his wife @entity46 ' @entity44 look at a @entity48 's theme cremation urn at the @entity13 stand at the @entity49 in @entity50 , @entity17 funeral homes such as @entity13 have started opening kiosk - style outlets in @entity17 malls on the belief that more people would plan ahead their funeral if they stumbled across the service , rather than had to go into a funeral home @entity13 planner @entity59 mans a kiosk store at @entity61 ' and it 's also , perhaps , a way to reach people who might be a little leery about coming directly into one of our parks , ' @entity35 added			1
as to why folks would be leery about that , industry officials acknowledge the answer is obvious : who really wants to enter a funeral home even one day before they have to ? ' funeral planning is something everybody knows they must do , but at the same time it 's something nobody wants to do , ' said @entity80 , executive director of the @entity81			2
' nobody gets up on a saturday morning and says , '' @entity83 , it 's a nice day			0
i wonder if i can go out and get myself a burial plot '' , ' @entity80 said			0
but if they 're strolling past a funeral outlet at the mall , where they 're surrounded by happy , lively people and maybe clutching a bag of mrs. field 's cookies , the thought is that they 'll feel differently			1
' when they 're going to the mall , people are not going out of need , ' said @entity100 , co-founder and ceo of @entity102 , which has outlets in malls in @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110			1
so if they do happen to see a place peddling coffins or urns while they 're pricing t - shirts and hoodies , @entity100 said , it will look far less intimidating			2
@entity13 's effort began modestly , with just one kiosk ( one of those movable things that usually sell stuff like calendars or ties ) in a mall in the @entity127 suburb of @entity128			1
when no one was creeped out , the program expanded to about a half - dozen malls			1
@entity13 regional sales manager @entity132 ( left ) shows @entity45 and his wife the @entity13 stand at the @entity49 on january 30 , 2014 @entity13 , famous as the final resting place for everyone from @entity136 to @entity41 , has begun staffing outlets at shopping malls , reasoning that planning for death , either for a loved one or yourself , might not be quite as intimidating for some people if it takes place in a lively , happy place like a mall now @entity13 periodically shuffles them from one mall to another to reach the largest audience			1
unlike the people at other such stations , who can seem like carnival barkers as they walk right up to you and hawk discount calling plans or free yogurt samples , @entity13 's operators are more discreet			1
at the entrance to a @entity161 in the @entity127 suburb of @entity163 last year , operators were quick to smile and hand out brochures when approached			0
but they kept their distance until people came to them			2
it was the same at a mall in @entity50 last week , where people stopped to examine cremation urns ranging from one with a subdued design of leaves to another that brightly featured the logo for the @entity48 baseball team			2
also on display was a recruiting poster for potential future @entity13 employees , complete with a picture of the great @entity48 pitcher @entity183 , who urged them to consider ' joining a winning team '			0
still , not everyone is thrilled with the idea			0
' you 're in a shopping mall and you 're walking along and there 's a funeral place ? ' retired high school teacher @entity188 said incredulously			2
' that sounds too deadly			0
' @entity45 and his wife @entity46 ' @entity44 look at a cremation urn at the @entity13 stand at the @entity49 in @entity50 after thinking it over , however , he acknowledged it 's something that could catch on			0
at age 86 , @entity188 said , he gets his share of mail from funeral operators inviting him to seminars at local restaurants , where he can have a meal on them while he hears a pitch on why he should use their services when he exits this mortal coil			2
he does n't care for that either , he said , but he figures somebody is attending those seminars			0
if the mall effort catches on , said @entity215 of the @entity216 , credit the aging @entity217 at least in part			1
historically , people have not wanted to talk , or even think , about their demise			2
but @entity217 , the oldest of whom are pushing 70 , are different			1
many are beginning to press for so - called green funerals that do n't require the use of coffins or burial vaults , @entity215 said			0
others want custom - made coffins or urns that say something about who they were			0
that often means something that represents a favorite car or sports team , said @entity236			0
he pointed out he even got a request once for a coffin built to resemble a portable toilet â€” from a guy whose company made portable toilets			0
with that mindset , could going to the mall and planning the whole deal just steps away from the @entity247 really be that unusual ?			0

funeral homes have begun opening kiosk - style stores in @entity17 malls in an attempt to sell more funeral plans in an ' impulse buy ' fashion
they say it *lowers* the *barriers* for people who find going into funeral homes ' creepy '
unlike their *predecessors* , the @entity217 *generation* - the oldest of whom are about 70 - are more willing to discuss death and plan ahead
