the head of the world ’s economic watchdog yesterday delivered an extraordinary call for the @entity4 to cut interest rates even further as @entity7 households were warned the income squeeze will last for another 18 months			1
@entity9 , of the @entity10 , gave a strong endorsement of the government ’s deficit cutting plan – but suggested that if growth failed to pick up , temporary cuts in @entity15 or @entity16 should be considered			1
mrs @entity9 said the @entity4 should ‘ reassess the efficacy ’ of cutting rates below the current record low of 0.5 per cent to reduce the cost of borrowing for businesses and homeowners			1
@entity24 and @entity10 chief @entity9 arrive for yesterday 's press conference at the @entity26 in @entity27 @entity28 insisted the @entity10 report showed @entity7 needed to come up with a ‘ plan b ’ to kickstart growth and stop the economy sliding further into recession			1
but chancellor @entity24 said the study backed his decision to take tough measures in 2010 to start slashing back the deficit inherited by the @entity38			2
mrs @entity9 ’s intervention raises the prospect of the first zero per cent interest rate since the @entity4 was founded in 1694			1
@entity42 cut rates to zero in the 1990s when it suffered a decade - long depression			2
but because the banks were so focused on reducing bad assets , they were not interested in handing out more loans and the plan did little to speed up growth			0
mrs @entity9 also suggested that the @entity4 considers a fresh round of money printing – so - called ‘ quantitative easing ’ – to stimulate growth			1
support : mrs @entity9 yesterday a strong endorsement of the @entity58 s deficit - cutting plan mr @entity24 welcomed yesterday ; s vote of confidence from the @entity10 both measures would be grim news for savers , who have already been hit hard by low interest rates and earlier rounds of @entity66 , which have helped drive the value of pension annuities to rock bottom levels			1
the @entity70 , meanwhile , warned that consumer prices will rise faster than disposable incomes both this year and next , meaning another year - and - a - half in which families can expect to be worse off in real terms			1
the @entity10 boss , in @entity27 to deliver her annual assessment of the @entity7 economy , delighted mr @entity24 by backing the @entity38 ’s deficit reduction measures			1
she said that when she looked back to the last election in may 2010 , she ‘ shivered ’ to imagine what would have happened to the @entity7 economy without the austerity programme			1
‘ she later told @entity84 that the @entity85 had cut the deficit from 11 per cent of national income to 8 per cent now			0
‘ you have to compare that against other countries which experienced severe deficit numbers , did not take action right away and are now facing very , very stressful financing terms that is putting their situation in jeopardy , ’ she said			0
however , in its annual assessment of the @entity7 ’s economic record , the @entity10 said the @entity26 should be ready to consider making temporary tax cuts to kickstart the economy if ‘ recovery fails to take off ’			1
one possibility would be a temporary cut in @entity15 , which was raised to 20 per cent from 17.5 per cent in the chancellor ’s first budget			0
such a move would be a political disaster for mr @entity24 , since it is precisely what @entity28 has been calling for since the economy began to stutter again in the final months of last year			2
an alternative would be for the government to offer a temporary cut in national insurance – raised by @entity28 before it left office – as a means of boosting business and jobs			0
the @entity10 noted that the economy remains ‘ flat ’ and warned that the weak recovery may be ‘ more protracted than previously anticipated ’			0
the chancellor listens intently as @entity9 said the @entity4 should ¿ reassess the efficacy ¿ of cutting rates below the current record low mrs @entity9 backed a suggestion by @entity125 that the government should consider using its hard - won credibility on the international money markets , which means @entity7 is able to borrow at record lows , to do more to underwrite infrastructure and housing projects and loans to small businesses			1
the @entity10 also suggested there was scope for the government to boost growth through higher infrastructure spending , which could be funded by imposing further public sector wage restraint or reforming property taxes			0
the chancellor said : ‘ the @entity10 could n’t be clearer			0
@entity7 has to deal with its debts and the government ’s fiscal policy is the appropriate one			2
’ pressure : the @entity4 has held interest rates at 0.5 % for several years but is being asked to go further @entity148 , the @entity141 , insisted a plan b was required			2
he added : ‘ if we fail to do so , and we see years of slow growth and high unemployment being entrenched			0
’ the @entity70 left its 2012 growth forecast unchanged at 0.5 per cent , but suggested another small decline in real incomes would be seen this year and next			2
households have already suffered the sharpest fall in living standards since the 1920s			0
the prime minister will today warn @entity162 leaders that @entity163 will be plunged into recession unless action is taken to prevent @entity166 falling out of the single currency			0
at an emergency summit on the eurozone crisis , mr @entity125 is expected to step up pressure on @entity172 chancellor @entity171 to allow the @entity173 to issue ‘ eurobonds ’ – which would effectively see @entity172 underwrite the debt of stricken countries such as @entity166 .			0

@entity9 has said that the move will be good for @entity7 homeowners and businesses
a zero rate would be the first in the @entity4 's *300* - year *history*
