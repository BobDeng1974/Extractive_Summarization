gps will be paid £ 55 for every patient diagnosed with dementia under a controversial scheme to boost detection			1
it is being rolled out by the @entity6 over concerns that family doctors are picking up less than half of all cases			1
but leading gps have branded the incentives unethical and say they will lead to patients being wrongly diagnosed and suffering needless anxiety			1
undetected : gps will be paid an incentive of £ 55 for patients diagnosed with dementia ( picture posed by model ) around 850,000 patients in @entity21 are thought to have dementia but only 45 per cent have had a formal diagnosis			1
this has partly been blamed on an attitude of fatalism among doctors and patients who assume the diagnosis is pointless as so little can be done			1
but health secretary @entity28 has called the situation ‘ shocking ’ and pledged to increase diagnosis rates to two - thirds by next year			0
@entity6 officials suspect this target is unreachable and are resorting to paying practices £ 55 for every patient diagnosed over the next five months			2
the incentives – uncovered by @entity37 – will see practices given the extra money depending on how many more patients are on their dementia register in march , compared to september just gone			1
it will be up to doctors how they spend this money and to either put it towards salaries or general running costs			2
but dr @entity46 , a gp from @entity48 , @entity49 , said it could potentially lead to doctors misdiagnosing patients			1
he also warned it may result in patients with very unlikely symptoms and their families having to go through the ordeal of rounds of dementia screening just in case			2
health secretary @entity28 has pledged to increase diagnosis rates to two - thirds by next year ‘ we need to think very carefully about this as it crosses a line that has not been crossed before – the direct payment on the basis of making a diagnosis – ‘ ‘ cash for diagnoses ’ ’ , ’ he said			0
‘ patients are at their most vulnerable when we make a diagnosis , because it is the doctor ’s judgment and so very difficult for the patient to challenge it			0
' the payment is not on the basis of caring for our patients , but only the diagnostic label we apply – this creates a major conflict of interests that is frankly unethical			0
’ dr @entity81 , former president of the @entity82 who practises in @entity84 , said : ‘ i think the proposal is an intellectual and ethical travesty			0
’ charities warned that the payments would only partly solve the problem as many patients with dementia are too frightened to make a @entity47 appointment			2
@entity93 , of the @entity94 , said : ‘ any step towards improving diagnosis is a good thing			0
however , a focus on enhanced payments is only part of the answer			0
‘ we know some doctors are reluctant to give a diagnosis because they know the right help and support is n’t available locally			0
‘ it ’s absolutely vital that every person with dementia understands what is happening to them and has access to the help they need afterwards			0
’ last month the head of the @entity6 , @entity114 , urged @entity115 to diagnose more patients with dementia , saying it was their ‘ basic human right ’ to know			1
he warned that there was an ‘ attitude of fatalism ’ about dementia in the @entity6 – and society – with patients and doctors thinking nothing could be done			1
an @entity126 spokesman said : ‘ more needs to be done to ensure that people living with dementia are identified so that they can get the care they need			2
this additional investment is part of a drive to ensure this			0

move is response to fewer than half of cases being picked up by @entity115
but leading family doctors say patients could be wrongly diagnosed
more than *400,000* people are thought to have *undiagnosed* dementia
