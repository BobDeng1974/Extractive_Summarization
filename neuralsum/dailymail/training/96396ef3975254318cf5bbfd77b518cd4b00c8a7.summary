by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 20:25 est , 17 november 2013 updated : 06:17 est , 18 november 2013 one of @entity3 ’s wealthiest men has pledged to do ‘ whatever it takes ’ to ensure @entity8 ’s @entity7 triumphs in next year ’s elections to the @entity10			1
eurosceptic businessman @entity11 , a former @entity12 backer , is promising to bankroll @entity7 ’s campaign			1
his intervention will heighten concerns within the @entity12 ranks that the seemingly inexorable rise of @entity7 could scupper any hopes they have of securing an outright majority in the next general election in 2015			2
donation : wealthy businessman @entity11 is promising to donate millions to @entity7 in his last significant foray into the political arena mr @entity11 donated a reported £ 1.5million to @entity7 ’s 2004 @entity26 election campaign			1
the party quadrupled its seats from three to 12			0
however , @entity7 trails behind the other main parties in fundraising and lacks the financial firepower needed to mount a major campaign			2
in the latest figures released by the @entity34 , @entity7 received just £ 113,326 in donations from july to september			0
the @entity36 received £ 3.3million , @entity37 £ 3.2million and the @entity38 £ 800,000			0
mr @entity11 , who has been estimated to be worth £ 650million , has given no indication of how much he is prepared to donate this time other than to say he will do ‘ whatever it takes ’ to ensure it is the largest @entity3 party in the @entity26 parliament			1
‘ i believe we have one last chance to stop the gradual erosion of our national independence			0
and that chance comes with the @entity26 elections , ’ he said in a statement			0
‘ if , as i hope and believe , @entity7 score a stunning national victory , then the leaders of the other main parties will have no choice but to abandon their slavish support for the @entity57			0
’ although the @entity26 elections are a poor indicator of performance in @entity62 elections , there will be concern among @entity36 that a strong showing by @entity7 next year will give them renewed momentum going into the general election			1
defected : mr @entity11 joined @entity8 's party in the early 00s over his hardline views on @entity26 while few expect them to take any seats at @entity62 , many @entity36 fear that they will draw enough votes to deny the @entity12 any chance of an overall majority			1
if @entity12 voters in some areas to @entity7 it could make it easier for @entity37 and the @entity38 to win crunch seats			2
mr @entity11 was a backer of the conservatives under @entity80 in the 1980s but broke with the party in 1991 over @entity83 ’s stance on the @entity84			1
in 2000 he briefly returned to the @entity12 fold under @entity86 only to be expelled the following year over his hardline views on @entity26			1
he said that he hoped success for @entity7 in next year ’s election would compel the other parties to accede to calls for an early referendum on @entity3 ’s membership of the @entity57			2
@entity12 support in the @entity94 has dropped further and the party is set to fare as badly there as in @entity97 , a poll reveals			0
its support in the region has dropped from 31 per cent to 29 per cent , with @entity37 strengthening to 35 per cent			0
the @entity102 asks voters to predict how well a party will do , rather than asking how they will vote .			0

@entity11 , a former @entity12 backer , has promised millions of *pounds* to @entity7 to ensure their success in the @entity10 elections
