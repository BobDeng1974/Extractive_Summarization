@entity0 has asked @entity1 not to pick him for @entity2 this month because of concerns about his game			1
the @entity6 defender , who has been part of the squad who qualified for next summer ’s @entity10 , contacted the under 21 coach before he named his 23 - man party for friendlies against @entity14 at @entity15 and @entity16 away on monday			1
@entity0 , 20 , has been playing at right back but sees his future for club and country as a central defender and @entity1 said he explained the benefits of staying with @entity6 rather than joining up with @entity2			1
@entity1 has revealed @entity0 ( pictured ) did not want to be included in his under 21 squad @entity23 defender @entity0 joined @entity6 from @entity25 outfit @entity24 in the summer @entity26 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity27 ; @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 ; @entity32 , @entity33 ; @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 ; @entity37			1
tv : live on @entity39 , kick - off 7.45pm			2
@entity1 has given it his full blessing and applauded @entity0 for having the honesty to confront the issue			1
this , @entity1 pointed out , is not a case of a young footballer having no ambition to represent his country			2
‘ this is an interesting one , ’ he said			0
‘ we had quite a mature conversation about it			0
he feels there are parts of his game he wants to work at			0
long term we both agree he is unlikely to be a full back			1
so we agreed , for this one , he stayed with @entity6			1
‘ it was quite refreshing			0
it did take me by surprise a little bit			0
he would have been in the squad and we thought he did well in @entity62 ( in the play - offs )			2
but i get what he is saying			0
@entity2 under 21 boss @entity1 revealed @entity0 wanted to work on his game away from the @entity2 squad ' he recognises there are others , like @entity68 and @entity30 , who are playing regularly in that position			1
’ this game against @entity14 will be a dress - rehearsal for @entity72 , as the two nations have been drawn in @entity74 , along with @entity75 and @entity76			2
@entity2 ’s preparations for next summer include fixtures next march against @entity79 and the @entity80			0
‘ we had those games in mind six months ago , ’ said @entity1			0
‘ the idea of going to the @entity80 is seeing what it will be like to have a base camp and playing good opposition			2
the @entity88 and @entity79 are two of the teams in the other group so it will be a good test			0
