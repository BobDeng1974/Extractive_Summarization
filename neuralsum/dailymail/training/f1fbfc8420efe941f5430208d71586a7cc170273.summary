the @entity1 ambassador to @entity2 has caused a furore among @entity2 after she made comments on @entity5 and @entity6 about the ' chaos ' she 'd experienced the @entity2 ski resort of @entity9			1
@entity10 was accused by @entity11 of ' violating diplomatic etiquette ' by posting critical comments about the resort on her @entity5 page and @entity6 feed			1
' i ’m trying to understand the chaos in the lift lines at @entity2 ski resorts , ' @entity10 wrote after spending @entity21 in the resort			1
the @entity2 system of queuing ( or not ) to get onto lifts came under fire after the @entity1 ambassador visited the resort of @entity9 in @entity2			1
( @entity29 pic shows skiers in @entity31 , @entity2 ) @entity33 : ' chaos at the ski lifts ' she added : ' we enjoyed a great day at @entity9 but i was so puzzled by the scrum heading to the lift ( and the inefficiency in terms of how many people were on each lift )			2
' she also asked her @entity5 followers which @entity2 resorts were the best organised , and wrote : ' is there an optimal way to navigate the line ? ' on @entity6 she asked people to share their ski lift experiences @entity50 said the ambassador ’s remarks were an attack on @entity2 ’s winter tourism and suggested that her comments could lead to a full scale diplomatic row , contacting @entity2 tourism director @entity58 to ask for his reaction			1
@entity58 duly commented : ' i talked to the ambassador and advised her to wait until the end of the season before drawing a final conclusion about the organization of @entity2 ski resorts			2
' he also added that the @entity2 ski resorts were ' not elitist ' , unlike in the @entity1			2
@entity50 said @entity10 , 42 , had made matters worse by trying to ' round up criticism ' about @entity2 by asking readers to share their lift line experiences , good , bad or indifferent , although she did not restrict the issue to @entity2 resorts			1
' ambassadors tell their governments about their host country in secret dispatches , ' the @entity77 - language tabloid wrote , adding that they should not ' snub ' the country in public			0
the ambassador and the head of tourism then tweeted each other about the issue			2
@entity58 wrote , ' thanks for skiing in # @entity2			0
yesterday was busiest day of season			0
rest of the season will be different - check it out			0
' to which @entity10 replied , ' @entity58 i 'm looking forward to checking it out a lot ! :-) ' @entity10 , contacted by @entity50 , admitted that she did not know whether the ski lift criticism was appropriate for a @entity1 ambassador , but she told the newspaper she believed that using social media was a suitable forum for dialogue on such matters			1
view onto the resort of @entity9 , @entity2 , where @entity1 ambassador @entity33 skiied at @entity105 the issue certainly prompted much debate , including readers who said it was ' perfectly reasonable to ask why this is tolerated in a civilized society '			1
an comment from ' @entity113 on a @entity2 newspaper website read : ' it 's not arrogant or ignorant it 's simply true - the queues for ski lifts can become quite nasty especially at the height of the season when there 's not much snow around			0
there 's never really any " @entity124 " style queuing at any ski resorts			0
why should n't diplomats be allowed to express an opinion about a leisure activity ? ' others said if she 'd had an opinion to express on operational efficiency it would have been better to have addressed the staff at the resort			0
the @entity135 also erupted with people leaping in to comment on her very public criticism			0
after her tweet , ' ich habe eine frage [ i have a question ] : i 'm trying to understand the chaos in the lift lines at @entity2 ski resorts ' @entity145 tweeted , ' i 'm trying to understand the chaos your government is producing around the world			2
' @entity10 subsequently posted a positive post : ' i had a great day of skiing @ @entity9 & am looking forward 2 more there & across the country			0
simply seeking advice on the experience			0
' @entity5 user @entity158 's tongue in cheek comment may well have raised a smile among those following the spat : ' the queue at a @entity2 ski lift is not much worse than the line before the immigration at @entity168 @entity167			1

@entity1 ambassador @entity10 *sparked* anger branding queue system ' chaos '
tabloid paper @entity50 suggested she had snubbed @entity2 tourism
