controversial plans to shut @entity2 hospital wards across the country – which could trigger a fresh wave of @entity6 closures – are quietly being drawn up by health bosses , @entity8 can reveal			1
billions of pounds will be diverted from hospital budgets to help pay for better care homes and home help under the proposals , which are set to be signed off by ministers within weeks			1
but according to official plans seen by this paper , it will force the imminent closure of emergency medical wards , surgical wards and dementia wards			1
closures : controversial plans to shut @entity2 hospital wards could trigger a fresh wave of @entity6 closures frontline doctors also fear the massive shake - up will cause more @entity6 departments to close – at a time of rapidly rising demand for emergency care			1
since 2007 , eight @entity32 a&es have been closed or downgraded			1
another 14 are known to be under threat and last year there were a record 3.8million emergency admissions			0
the £ 3.8billion @entity36 is meant to ensure that the sick and elderly only end up in hospital when they really need to be there and stop them staying in a ward for longer than necessary			2
but @entity42 calculations have shown that the scheme will ‘ transfer ’ at least £ 2billion a year from the health service budget			0
ministers are due to approve the ward closures by april 21			1
one leading @entity6 doctor warned last night that the plans would ‘ break the system ’ , leaving emergency patients without beds			2
dr @entity54 said handing so much @entity2 money to social care was ‘ like robbing @entity57 to pay @entity58 ’ , adding : ‘ i think there ’s every chance this could lead to a new wave of @entity6 closures			1
’ elderly : under the proposals , billions of pounds will be diverted from hospital budgets to pay for care homes the consultant , who last year helped save @entity6 at @entity67 in @entity68 from the axe , went on to say : ‘ these plans are extremely worrying given that hospitals are already in a precarious state			1
we are on the edge of an unmitigated disaster			0
’ the government has tried to deny that the @entity36 amounts to an @entity2 cut – and continues to insist it has no policy of shutting a&es			2
denial : care minister @entity82 insisted : ' this is not about cuts or taking money away from hospitals ' but @entity42 has claimed that the fund will lead to a 15 per cent drop in emergency admissions after it kicks in next april , and gp - led clinical commissioning groups , which deliver services , have been asked to model ‘ savings ’ in their budget accordingly			1
they have been told to ‘ clearly identify where the @entity2 savings will be realised ’ – and will have to show where they could each make an estimated £ 16million worth of cuts			0
organisations bidding for the fund ’s cash are also required to state how they think hospital services will have been ‘ reconfigured ’ in five years ’ time			0
an @entity42 powerpoint presentation reminds the applicants of the need to convince staff and the public about the benefits of ‘ major service changes as a result of five - year strategy plans and the @entity36 ’			0
but critics have warned that the money will simply disappear into council budgets			0
doctors have also claimed that its aims – while ‘ laudable ’ – are wildly optimistic			0
labour health spokesman @entity120 said : ‘ @entity121 promised not to cut the @entity2 , but he is now raiding it to fill the holes his £ 2billion cuts have left in social care			2
’ but care minister @entity82 insisted : ‘ this is not about “ cuts ” or taking money away from hospitals – it is about providing better joined - up care closer to home			0
@entity132 is a major step to making this a reality			0
