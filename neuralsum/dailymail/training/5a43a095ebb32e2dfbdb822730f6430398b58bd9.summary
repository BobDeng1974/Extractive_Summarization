by @entity0 published : 05:52 est , 1 february 2013 updated : 07:28 est , 1 february 2013 @entity2 has been accused of lending billions to @entity3 just so the @entity5 state would plough it back in again to help avoid an embarrassing government bailout , it emerged today			0
the deal is alleged to have been set up in 2008 , at the height of the banking crisis , and is being probed by the @entity10 and the @entity11			1
according to reports more than £ 6billion was lent to @entity13 , part of the rich country 's huge investment fund , which then bought shares in @entity2 to help them avoid becoming part - nationalised like @entity18 and the @entity19			1
this investment was a critical show of support for @entity2 when many were pulling their money out of banking shares			0
more scandal : @entity2 has today been accused of underwriting a @entity3 share deal to ensure the bank did not go bust in 2008 the @entity3 funding machine owns @entity31 , @entity33 's @entity32 and is the largest shareholder of @entity35 's			2
@entity2 ' alleged loan to @entity3 would be underwriting their later investment , which breaches @entity39 's financial regulations			1
at the time it would have given the impression that a new £ 6billion investment had been made in the bank at a critical stage , but in reality @entity2 would have had to have borrowed the money to fund the loan which was then used to buy the shares			2
the probe comes as the terms of the bank 's fundraising at the height of the financial crisis are already being scrutinised , but allegations of a loan to the @entity3 is a new strand			2
last year the authorities started looking at the fees paid for fundraising deals in 2008			0
@entity2 is already trying to rebuilt its reputation after it was fined a record £ 290million for its role in rigging the interbank interest rate known as @entity66 , which affects how much customers pay for mortgages and credit cards			0
setting this rate low was a bid to paint a rosier picture of the bank 's financial health at the time of the financial crisis			0
the rate fixing scandal led to resignation of former chief executive @entity79 , chairman @entity80 and chief operating officer @entity81			0
former @entity83 banker @entity82 , now at @entity84 , told the @entity85 today : ' the concept of lending money to any investor to purchase your own shares raises a series of immediate questions about disclosure and other regulatory issues			0
' embarrassing : former @entity2 chief executive @entity79 was forced to resign and the bank was fined a record £ 290million after it manipulated @entity66 blow : new chief executive @entity97 is trying to rebuild the bank 's reputation but has now been hit with a @entity11 and @entity10 probe into the alleged loan the allegation piles yet more pressure on @entity2 chief executive @entity97 as he pledged to help it bounce back			1
row : the @entity3 investment was alleged made by the group led by prime minister @entity108 ( pictured ) , but there is no suggestion of wrongdoing on his part the @entity85 says @entity2 received cash injections in 2008 worth a total of £ 6.1 billion from @entity13 , which is a subsidiary of the @entity13 , and @entity116 , an investment vehicle of sheikh hamad bin @entity117 , the prime minister of @entity3 and his family			2
there is no suggestion that they have carried out any wrongdoing			0
investors from @entity125 and other sovereign wealth funds also pumped cash into the group as part of a capital raising to prevent the government bailing it out - a move that helped it avoid the fate suffered by part - nationalised @entity19 and @entity134			1
but existing shareholders complained the terms offered to the new investors were too attractive , while the fees paid for the deal are also thought to be under investigation			0
the @entity11 and the @entity10 were approached by @entity141 today but refused to comment			1
a @entity2 spokeswoman said : ' both the @entity11 and @entity10 investigations are on - going and , as such , we are unable to comment further			1
' @entity2 said in august that @entity39 's fraud prosecutors had launched a criminal probe into payments between the bank and @entity3 , a month after revealing the @entity11 's investigation into dealings between the two parties			1
it said the @entity11 probe was into the bank and four current and former senior employees , including finance director @entity156 .			2

alleged £ *6bn* deal helped the bank avoid part - nationalisation suffered by @entity18 and @entity19
*bankrolling* a share purchase like this would break @entity39 financial regulations
