by @entity0 published : 06:06 est , 4 february 2014 @entity2 : 10:15 est , 4 february 2014 residents of @entity4 in @entity5 were a part of military history earlier this month when a convoy of trucks drove through the small town			1
although this convoy looked like the usual stream of trucks that often passes through the area , there was one notable omission - drivers			2
each of the trucks in the convoy were part of an autonomous fleet of vehicles being tested by the @entity23 , with the hope they will one day be deployed to urban battle areas			1
each of the driverless tactical vehicles were tested on their abilities to navigate hazards and obstacles including road intersections , oncoming traffic , pedestrians and traffic circles called the @entity40 , the technology used in the recent @entity4 tests included a high performance @entity44 sensor - or laser radar			1
this remote sensing technology is capable of scanning the road ahead and measuring distances by illuminating a target with a laser , and analysing the light that is reflected			2
the module is also fitted with a gps receiver to plan , and track the convoy ’s route			1
@entity57 's self - driving cars use similar sensors and technologies to navigate through towns and cities			0
the demonstration was a joint project between the @entity64 ( @entity65 ) and @entity28 in @entity66			0
each of the driverless tactical vehicles were tested on their abilities to navigate hazards and obstacles including road intersections , oncoming traffic , stalled and passing vehicles , pedestrians and traffic circles in both urban and rural test areas			1
the autonomous vehicles were part of the @entity23 and @entity76 ’ @entity77 ( @entity79 ) program , and the successful convoy was the final stage of the program ’s @entity82			2
the vehicles used in the recent @entity4 tests were fitted with a high performance @entity44 sensor - or laser radar			1
this remote sensing technology is capable of scanning the road ahead and measuring distances by illuminating a target with a laser , and analysing the light that is reflected the autonomous vehicles , pictured , were part of the @entity23 and @entity96 ( @entity79 ) program , and the successful convoy was the final stage of the program 's @entity82			2
members of the @entity23 and @entity28 are shown monitoring the tests this program was set up to add automated driving features to current tactical vehicles in the @entity23 ’s fleet			0

this remote sensing technology is capable of scanning the road ahead and measuring distances by illuminating a target with a laser , and analysing the light that is reflected			0
the module is also fitted with a gps receiver to plan , and track the convoy ’s route , and all of this technology can be installed as a kit to ‘ virtually any military vehicle ’			1
in the @entity82 demonstration , the kit was integrated onto the @entity23 's @entity126 trucks and the @entity127 ( @entity129 ) vehicle , pictured			0
@entity57 's self - driving cars use similar sensors and technologies to navigate through towns and cities the vehicles were also fitted with a gps receiver so members of the @entity138 ( @entity65 ) could plan , and track the convoy 's route on handheld computers , pictured in the @entity82 demonstration , the kit was integrated onto the @entity23 ’s @entity126 trucks and the @entity127 ( @entity129 ) vehicle			1
‘ the @entity146 hardware and software performed exactly as designed , and dealt successfully with all of the real - world obstacles that a real - world convoy would encounter , ’ said @entity143 , @entity79 program manager for @entity144			0
‘ it was very important that we had representation from the technology , acquisition and user bases , along with our industry partners , here at the @entity82 , ’ added @entity65 technical manager @entity157			0
' we are very pleased with the results of the demonstration , because it adds substantial weight to the @entity23 ’s determination to get robotic systems into the hands of the warfighter			0

the autonomous convoy was tested at @entity4 , @entity5 earlier this month
tests *involved* navigating hazards including traffic and pedestrians
gps units fitted to each truck were used to plan and track their course
while laser radars scanned the road looking for obstructions and *people*
other trucks were then programed to follow the leader in convoy
