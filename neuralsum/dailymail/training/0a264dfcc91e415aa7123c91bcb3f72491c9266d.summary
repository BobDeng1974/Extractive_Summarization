by @entity1 - @entity0 follow @ @ riathalsam poor @entity2			1
they left their coach to boos from the @entity7 fans and exited the pitch to laughter and waves from the same supporters			1
in between , they could probably count themselves lucky to have lost the match by only two goals , scored by @entity15 and @entity16			1
make no mistake , @entity18 's side were extremely disappointing in their first competitive fixture under the new manager			1
barring the chance fluffed by @entity24 early in the second half they offered next to nothing , the only consolation being that their play after the break was better than that which went before			2
opener : @entity7 's @entity15 ( left ) celebrates with @entity34 ( right ) after scoring the first goal top dogs : @entity2 manager @entity18 ( left ) chats club owner @entity37 ( right ) @entity7 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity38 ; @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 ; @entity34 , @entity16 ; @entity43 7 ( @entity44 67 ) @entity45 , @entity46 ( @entity47 67 ) ; @entity48 ( @entity49 81 )			1
subs not used : @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54			2
@entity2 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity55 ; @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 ; @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 ; @entity63 ( @entity64 79 ) , @entity65 ( @entity66 64 ) , @entity24 ( @entity67 58 )			1
subs not used : @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 ref : @entity73 att : 16,205 @entity74 : @entity15 had @entity24 scored , they might have taken a draw or gone on to better , which really would have been an insult to @entity7 , who flirted so intensely with relegation to @entity79 last season but looked a cut above @entity2			1
within nine minutes , @entity41 had put @entity83 's side ahead			2
and moments later he probably should have doubled the advantage			2
in the first instance , @entity43 , impressive throughout , found space down the right and whipped over a cross			2
it was a low delivery that @entity15 met with a volley to the right of @entity93			1
a goal up and it soon should have been two			2
ironically , the chance that fell to @entity7 's centre - half after 17 minutes was probably easier			1
a corner came over from the right and @entity41 out - jumped – perhaps out - muscled – @entity57 at the far post			0
@entity93 was nowhere close but @entity102 's header missed the target			0
@entity104 had an even better chance in first - half stoppage time , but was unable to direct his free header away from @entity93			0
that he had so much time and space said plenty about @entity2			1
a lack of cutting edge is one thing , and quite expected when a player like @entity116 is sold , regardless of the grand fee			0
but they also lacked fluency in all areas of the pitch			0
@entity18 , despite the modesty of his management cv , was known for stylish football at @entity126			0
there was none of that at @entity130 ; indeed it was hard to recall a reasonable opportunity in the first half			0
arm in arm : @entity2 's @entity63 ( left ) and @entity7 's @entity45 battle for the ball @entity7 , on the other hand , played with spirit			1
maybe that 's a @entity83 thing			0
he has set up a players ' committee to let them have a whinge when necessary , so long as they balance their grievances with positive thoughts			0
the atmosphere at this club last season was , according to those involved , poor			0
they turned their season around by virtue of an eight - game unbeaten run and that seems to have continued into the new campaign			2
in @entity48 they have a striker whose attributes include more than a passing friendship with @entity161			0
he was not at his most effective yesterday , but in holding play up , he was an obvious platform for attacking runs from @entity43 and and @entity46			0
opening day : @entity7 's @entity45 ( left ) is fouled by @entity2 's @entity60 it was @entity46 who twice had excellent chances to score @entity7 's second in the opening moments after the break			1
first , he went clean through only to shoot straight at @entity171			0
he then had a reasonable call for a penalty ignored when he was tripped by @entity56 after beating two defenders			2
@entity24 , meanwhile , blew @entity2 best chance after a howler from @entity38 , who left his line and failed to gather a loose ball			1
it fell to @entity24 but his poked shot was cleared off the line by @entity40			0
that was as good as it got for @entity2 , but after such a modest rise came a sharper fall when @entity49 was brought down late on and @entity16 scored the penalty			1
new season : mounted police officers outside @entity130 before the opening match of the campaign			0

new @entity2 manager suffers defeat in first *championship* game
@entity7 took an early lead through @entity15 strike in the eight minute
@entity16 sealed the three points with a late penalty for the home side
