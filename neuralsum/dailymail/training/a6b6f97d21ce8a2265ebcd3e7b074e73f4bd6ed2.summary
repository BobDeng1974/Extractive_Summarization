by @entity0 published : 18:11 est , 29 july 2013 @entity2 : 02:11 est , 1 august 2013 the apparent decision by the @entity4 to breastfeed has been given a boost by fresh evidence showing it can help raise a baby ’s iq			0
the longer the child is breastfed – ideally exclusively – the higher the intelligence scores are at the age of seven			0
the study also found breastfeeding can enhance language skills from the age of three			1
the duchess of @entity19 's apparent decision to try to breastfeed @entity20 has been boosted by evidence showing it can raise a child 's iq the @entity25 researchers recommend babies are solely fed on breast milk for the first six months and are given the chance to breastfeed until a year old			1
however , @entity30 experts warned that delaying the introduction of solid foods until six months at the earliest might leave some babies feeling hungry			1
it emerged yesterday that the @entity4 has at least one maternity dress made for breastfeeding and was given encouragement in hospital to help her baby @entity39 start on her milk			1
earlier research has shown breast milk protects babies against stomach bugs , chest infections , asthma and allergies , and confers health advantages in later life			1
but only a small number of women in the @entity30 breastfeed their babies for long periods and the number of new mothers starting in 2011 fell slightly to 73.9 per cent			2
barely 2 per cent of babies are breastfed exclusively for six months			1
the latest study included 1,312 mothers and children who had taken part in @entity61 , a long - term investigation of pregnancy and child health in the @entity25			1
it found seven - year - olds breastfed for the first year of life were likely to score four points more in a test of verbal iq than bottle - fed children			2
verbal intelligence scores at seven increased by 0.35 points for every extra month of breastfeeding			2
three - year - olds also benefited , having higher scores in a language - acquisition test the longer they had been breastfed			0
exclusive breastfeeding had the greatest effect			0
the @entity25 team of researchers reported the findings in the journal @entity84			1
the scientists , led by dr @entity86 , from @entity87 , said : ‘ our results support a causal relationship of breastfeeding in infancy with receptive language at age three and with verbal and non-verbal iq at school age			2
' these findings support national and international recommendations to promote exclusive breastfeeding through age six months and continuation of breastfeeding through at least age one year			2
' a number of factors that might have influenced the results , including home environment and mothers ' iq , were accounted for by the researchers			0
children took part in several tests , including the @entity110 at age three and the @entity112 at age seven			0
certain nutrients in breast milk may benefit the developing infant brain , it has been suggested			1
one of these is docosahexaenoic ( @entity120 ) , which is abundant in fish			0
part of the research looked at whether mothers ' fish consumption was linked to the benefits of breastfeeding but the results were not statistically significant			0
@entity4 has had at least one maternity dress made for breastfeeding , it has emerged it is thought that chemicals naturally present in breast milk can aid brain development , but skin to skin contact and bonding during breastfeeding may also play a part			1
but @entity138 , an independent breastfeeding counsellor and former midwife , said : ‘ it ’s best to keep an open mind about what your baby ’s individual needs are			0
' many babies feel hungry if they only get breast milk and most need solids before six months			1
’ she said mothers who can breastfeed their babies easily are giving them a great start in life			0
she said : ' most women who give up find it too difficult to continue			0
@entity156 was given encouragement in hospital to help baby @entity39 start on her milk ' they are not unaware of the benefits to the baby , they have been brainwashed into thinking if they do n't their baby will miss out and it can be a very worrying time			0
ms @entity138 , the author of @entity169 and @entity170 , said there was new evidence that breastfeeding exclusively for six months may not be best for baby , putting them at risk of allergies , food aversion and even obesity			2
babies can be safely given solid foods at least eight weeks earlier in life than official @entity183 guidelines telling women to breastfeed exclusively for the first six months , according to researchers .			1

@entity25 researchers found breastfeeding can enhance language skills from three
they recommend babies are fed solely on breast milk for first six months
