@entity0 is preparing a new push to re-enter @entity3 politics as he hires a new spin doctor to put a gloss on some of the criticism that has followed him since leaving @entity8			1
the former prime minister ‘ has things to say ’ and believes the time is right for him to make an impact on the home front after years in political exile			1
mr @entity0 's is expected to launch his comeback as he appears on a joint platform with @entity18 leader @entity17 in july at an event to celebrate the @entity20			1
his wife @entity21 is also due to attend , making it a rare public outing for the @entity24 together			1
' i have things to say ' : @entity0 wants to re-engage with @entity3 politics after amassing an estimated £ 20million fortune since leaving office five years ago could the return of @entity0 be good for @entity3 politics ? could the return of @entity0 be good for @entity3 politics ? now share your opinion the ex-pm is understood to believe that enough time has passed for people to have forgotten the disastrous effect of the @entity37 war on his image and how he was humiliatingly forced from office by @entity40			1
the move to hire a public relations expert is proof that mr @entity0 wants to be heard on a range of subjects			1
the spin doctor will also attempt to portray mr @entity0 's cash schemes - such as charging up to £ 300,000 for after - dinner speeches - in a more positive light			1
in the latest accusation of greed , it was revealed in january that mr @entity0 made millions of pounds last year but paid just a fraction of it in tax thanks to a complicated web of companies he has established			1
prime minister @entity57 , left , is understood to be in the sights of mr @entity0 , who has been having regular chats with @entity60 @entity17 , right , a great admirer of the politician turned businessman the former prime minister ’s secretive business empire declared an income of £ 12million			1
but he was able to reduce his tax bill to just £ 315,000 after writing off almost £ 11million as ‘ administrative expenses ’ – a ‘ surprisingly ’ high figure , according to one accountant			0
being driven out of office by a plotting former ally may not have seemed like the most edifying climax to his premiership			0
but for @entity0 his fortunes have gone from strength to strength since since leaving @entity78 in june 2007			1
it 's perhaps no surprise then that he quit his job as an mp for @entity82 - a post he had for two - and - a - half decades - with its £ 65,000 salary			2
instead , he seems to have left his socialist ideals in @entity86 and quickly embarked on the lucrative after - dinner circuit where he can pocket up to £ 250,000 a night for a 90 - minute delivery			0
the ex-pm signed a £ 5million deal with @entity91 in the same year as leaving office to write his @entity8 memoirs			2
the royalties from those are said to have earned him millions more			0
he was later appointed @entity97 peace envoy			1
but if he that was n't keeping him busy enough , mr @entity0 set up the the @entity100 in may 2008 to spread his message around the world			2
this spawned the @entity104 and the charities are now moving into bigger buildings			0
he is also a senior advisor at investment bank @entity107 ( salary estimates range between £ 500,000 and £ 2.5m ) and advises the @entity111 insurance firm @entity110 on climate change issues for a reputed £ 1m a year , not to mention his consulting role with luxury goods firm @entity114			0
and he was said to have been paid an estimated £ 1m for writing a report for the government of @entity117 on the future of the oil - rich state			0
indeed , such is the demand for mr @entity0 's advisory services that he set up a commercial consultancy firm , @entity122 , which by then end of 2010 had banked at least £ 2m advising foreign countries and businesses			1
finally , @entity0 , who is married to @entity126 , the barrister daughter of actor @entity127 , also boasts an enviable property portfolio			2
at one point he had seven homes around the country worth at least £ 15m			0
on top of this , @entity0 receives £ 84,000 of taxpayers ' money to run a private office , and he is also entitled to draw a pension of £ 63,468			1
the figures show that mr @entity0 employed 26 staff , paying them total wages of almost £ 2.3million , while another £ 850,000 went on office rent and equipment			1
yet that leaves almost £ 8million of unexplained ‘ expenses ’ in the accounts , lodged at @entity147			0
mr @entity0 has now recruited @entity148 , an @entity149 and @entity150 press officer who is now communications director at charity the @entity151 ( @entity151 )			2
the former @entity152 is still employed as a @entity97 peace envoy , as well as running a faith foundation and earning millions of pounds in consultancy fees through a complicated web of companies			1
but for several months he has been privately meeting small groups of @entity18 mps to discuss domestic politics			0
mr @entity0 has targeted old allies and members of the 2010 intake , advising on how to target the @entity164 and the @entity165 , who he believes made a historic error by joining the @entity168			2
mr @entity17 ’s aides say the pair now talk ‘ regularly ’ – code for chats every few weeks – about domestic politics and foreign affairs			2
mr @entity0 ’s aides think the time is right for him to speak out in the @entity3			1
they believe enough time has passed since he was driven from office in 2007 on a wave of disgust at the @entity181			1
a source close to mr @entity0 said : ‘ he wants to re-engage in the @entity3			2
he has things to say and he thinks it ’s the right time			2
‘ the question is how he re-enters the @entity3 scene without re-entering domestic politics and interfering with the @entity18			0
' he wants to intervene where he can add value to political debate , but it will be above party politics			0
’ mr @entity17 opposed the war in @entity37 but respects mr @entity0 as one of the most accomplished political message - makers of his time			1
@entity148 will take up her role later this month , overseeing the former prime minister ’s personal public relations and taking charge of the communications strategy for his extensive business operations			0
her appointment has been seen in the pr industry as an attempt to rebuild mr @entity0 ’s reputation at home , following adverse publicity over his money - spinning ventures			2
he has attracted criticism for combining his business interests with charitable work and his @entity97 role and is thought to have amassed a fortune in excess of £ 20million in the five years since he left @entity78 and stepped down as mp for @entity82 , @entity86 , which he had served since 1983			2
mr @entity0 has also amassed a property portfolio , including homes in @entity220 and country retreats , that at one point was worth £ 15m			0
he has also been criticised for earning cast sums for his after - dinner speeches			0
he charges up to £ 250,000 a time for just 90 minutes			0
miss @entity148 previously worked in no 10 as a senior press officer , going on to be head of news at the @entity229 and then the @entity230			0
@entity0 next to @entity231 @entity232 , left , and @entity234 chairman and ceo @entity235 , right , as they accept their @entity237 at @entity239 's @entity238 former @entity241 cabinet minister @entity240 attacked the @entity152 , branding his political legacy ‘ debt , war , ignorance , welfare dependency , social division ’			1
he said : ‘ blairite education policies have brought about an upsurge in illiteracy and innumeracy , and left a generation of near - unemployable young people			0
’ @entity0 's apparent political comeback will mean less attention for his charitable ventures			1
upon leaving office he set up the @entity100 then the @entity104			0
the charities have been so successful that last month it was reported that they were moving out into bigger offices			0
there is no doubt that the @entity0 was one of the smartest political operators in @entity264 since @entity265 , but he was not a flawless character			1
@entity0 will be remembered for the @entity181 , and all the accusations of lies and evasions that that spawned			0
many in the @entity18 would simply like to forget him , even though he brought them an unprecedented three general election wins			0
and i expect the last thing that @entity17 wants is to be overshadowed by @entity0 , however ‘ helpful ’ the former prime minister claims to be			1

ex-pm and wife @entity21 to appear *alongside* @entity17 at an @entity20 event in july *...* and he 's already hired a spin doctor
he thinks enough time has passed since 2007 for people to have forgotten the @entity37 war and how he was forced out of office
still has a job as @entity97 peace envoy and a complex web of businesses earning millions
@entity0 's political legacy is ' debt , war , ignorance , welfare dependency and social division ' , says @entity240
