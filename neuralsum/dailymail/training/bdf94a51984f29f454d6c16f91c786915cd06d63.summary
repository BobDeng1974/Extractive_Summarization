the @entity0 handed opponents of @entity2 over to @entity3 with only thin ' diplomatic assurances ' that they would not be mistreated - and several were subsequently tortured in prison , a human rights group has claimed			1
the damning report from @entity8 paints a more complete picture of @entity11 's close cooperation with the regime of @entity3 's former dictator @entity2 in the wake of the 9/11 attacks			1
the report also says waterboarding at @entity18 - run prisons was more widespread than has been acknowledged			2
allies : the damning report claims the @entity0 authorities handed @entity2 his enemies ' on a silver platter ' new details of brutal treatment by @entity27 - era interrogators included how terror suspects were not allowed to bathe for periods of up to three months			1
the 154 - page @entity8 report features interviews by the @entity34 - based group with 14 @entity3 dissident exiles			1
they describe systematic abuses while they were held in @entity0 - led detention centers in @entity39 – some for as long as two years – or in @entity0 - led interrogations in @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and elsewhere before the @entity0 handed them over to @entity3			1
‘ not only did the @entity0 deliver ( @entity2 ) his enemies on a silver platter , but it seems the @entity18 tortured many of them first , said @entity48 , counterterrorism adviser at @entity8 and author of the report			1
‘ the scope of the @entity27 administration abuse appears far broader than previously acknowledged , ’ she said			1
the report comes days after the @entity54 announced it would not bring criminal charges against any @entity18 personnel over severe interrogation methods used in the detention and rendition program			2
investigators said they could not prove any interrogators went beyond guidelines authorized by the @entity27 administration			1
rights activists and some @entity66 administration officials say even the authorized techniques constituted torture , though the @entity18 and @entity27 administration argue they do not			1
any new instances of waterboarding , however , would go beyond the three that the @entity18 has said were authorized			0
former president @entity27 has claimed waterboarding was only used on three senior @entity73 figures former president @entity27 , his vice president @entity75 and the @entity18 have said that the method was used on only three senior @entity73 suspects at secret @entity18 black sites in @entity43 and @entity78 – @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 , all currently being held at @entity83 , @entity84			1
the technique involves pouring water on a hooded detainee 's nose and mouth until he feels he is drowning			2
the 14 @entity3 interviewed by @entity8 were swept up in the @entity0 hunt for @entity92 militants and @entity73 figures around the world after the sept. 11 , 2001 attacks			1
they were mostly members of the @entity95 who fled in the 1980s and 1990s to @entity41 , @entity39 and @entity98 countries			0
the group ran training camps in @entity39 at the same time @entity73 was based there but it largely shunned @entity102 and his campaign against the @entity0 , focusing instead on fighting @entity2			1
ironically , the @entity0 turned around and helped the @entity3 opposition overthrow @entity2 in 2011			1
now several of the 14 former detainees hold positions in the new @entity3 government			1
the accounts of new uses of simulated drowning came from two former detainees , @entity112 and @entity113 , who also described a gamut of abuses they went through			0
the two were seized in @entity41 in april 2003 and taken to @entity0 - run prisons in @entity39 , where @entity112 was held for 16 months and @entity113 for two years before they were handed over to @entity3			1
in @entity39 , they were shackled in cells for months in variety of positions , often naked in almost total darkness with music blaring continuously , left to defecate and urinate on themselves			0
for example , @entity113 spent three weeks seated on the ground in his cell with his ankles and wrists chained to a ring in the wall , forcing him to keep his arms and legs elevated			0
he said he was taken out of his shackles once a day for a half - hour to eat			0
@entity83 : a @entity136 mp holds down the head of a detainee so he is not identified for the first three months , they were not allowed to bathe			1
‘ we looked like monsters , ’ @entity112 said			0
@entity142 described being locked naked for a day and a half in a tall , narrow , half - meter - wide ( 1 1/2 - foot - wide ) chamber with his hands chained above his head , with no food as @entity149 music blasted loudly from speakers next to his ears the entire time			0
at another point , he was stuffed into a 1 meter by 1 meter ( 3 foot by 3 foot ) box resembling a footlocker and kept there for more than an hour as interrogators prodded him with long , thin objects through holes in the side of the box			0
both he and @entity113 said they were repeatedly taken to a room where they were slammed against a wooden wall and punched in the abdomen			0
@entity142 said one female @entity0 interrogator told him , ‘ now you are under the custody of the @entity0			0
in this place there will be no human rights			0
since september 11 , we have forgotten about something called human rights , ’ according to the report			0
@entity142 described being waterboarded , though he did not use the term			0
he said he was put in a hood and strapped upside down on a wooden board			0
freezing water was poured over his nose and mouth until he felt he was suffocating			0
during several half - hour interrogation sessions , they would waterboard him multiple times , asking him questions in between while a doctor monitored his body temperature			0
‘ they would n't stop until they got some sort of answer from me , ’ he told @entity8			1
@entity193 described a similar technique			0
instead of being strapped to a board , he was put on a plastic sheet with guards holding up the edges , while freezing water was poured over him , including onto his hooded face directly over his mouth and nose			0
‘ i felt as if i were suffocating , ’ he told @entity8			2
‘ i spent three months getting interrogated heavily ... and they gave me a different kind of torture every day			0
sometimes they used water , sometimes not			0
’ president @entity66 has called a halt to waterboarding in @entity0 facilities asked about the new accounts , @entity18 spokeswoman @entity210 said the agency ‘ has been on the record that there are three substantiated cases ’ of the use of waterboarding			0
she said she could not comment on the specific allegations but noted the @entity54 's decision not to prosecute after it ‘ exhaustively reviewed the treatment of more than 100 detainees in the post- 9/11 period – including allegations involving unauthorized interrogation techniques			0
’ the @entity66 administration has ordered a halt to waterboarding and many of the severe techniques authorized by its predecessors			0
others of the 14 former detainees in the @entity8 described similar conditions as @entity112 and @entity113 , particularly three held in the same @entity0 - led prisons in @entity39			2
one of them , @entity234 , said he nearly went insane in isolation after months being shackled naked in dark , freezing cells with music blaring , pounding his head against the wall and screaming , ‘ i want to die , why do n't you just kill me ? ’ another , detained in @entity242 , said that during interrogations by a foreigner he believed was @entity0 , his wife was brought to the detention center ; his captors showed him his wife through a peephole and threatened to rape her if he did not cooperate			0
@entity8 said the @entity0 failed in its post- 9/11 campaign to distinguish between islamists targeting the @entity0 and those who ‘ may simply have been engaged in armed opposition against their own repressive regimes			2
‘ this failure risked aligning the @entity0 with brutal dictators , ’ the report said			0
former @entity260 prime minister @entity259 had a public rapprochement with @entity2 in 2004 eight of those interviewed were handed over to @entity3 in 2004 – the same year then - @entity260 prime minister @entity259 made a public rapprochement with @entity2 and @entity269 - @entity268 oil giant @entity267 signed a major exploration deal off the @entity3 coast , the @entity8 report noted			1
the remaining six were transferred to @entity3 over the two following years			2
all were jailed by @entity2 's regime , most of them freed only after his fall			1
@entity275 said they were not physically tortured – perhaps a result of @entity2 's attempts to mend fences with the @entity280 – but were kept in solitary confinement for long periods			1
several , however , told @entity8 they were beaten and tortured , including being given electrical shocks			1
the report also calls into question @entity3 claims that one figure handed over by the @entity0 , @entity288 , committed suicide in a @entity3 prison			1
@entity291 was held in @entity0 secret prisons for years after 2001 and gave information under torture by the @entity295 that the @entity27 administration used to justify the 2003 invasion of @entity298 but was later discredited			2
after his handover , @entity3 authorities said he hanged himself in his cell			2
but @entity8 researchers said they were shown photos of his body that showed signs of torture			2
messages to @entity3 from the @entity18 and @entity260 intelligence among the @entity310 published by @entity8 indicated the @entity0 and @entity260 were eager to help @entity3 obtain several senior @entity312 figures , including its co-founders , @entity314 and @entity315			1
@entity314 and his then - pregnant wife were detained by @entity317 with the help of @entity260 intelligence and then handed over to the @entity18 in @entity43 , where he told @entity8 he was stripped and beaten			1
they were then taken to @entity3 , where @entity314 was imprisoned			2
after @entity314 arrived in @entity3 , a message believed to be from the then - head of counterterrorism at @entity260 intelligence congratulates the @entity3 intelligence chief			2
@entity260 's help ‘ was the least we could do for you and for @entity3 to demonstrate the remarkable relationship we have built , ’ he wrote .			1
