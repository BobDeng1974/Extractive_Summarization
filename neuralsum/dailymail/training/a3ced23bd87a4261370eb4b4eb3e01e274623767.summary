when @entity2 the chihuahua was born without front legs he was reduced to hopping around as his disability left him unable to walk			1
but two months later and @entity2 is living up to his name after being fitted with a @entity7 printed body harness and skateboard wheels			1
@entity2 was given up at just four weeks old by his first owners who felt unable to care for him , and was taken in by veterinarian technician @entity12			2
however he was soon adopted and has now been fitted with a @entity7 printed body harness and a set of wheels @entity2 was adopted by veterinarian technician @entity12 who originally fitted him with a set of toy wheels , but launched an online campaign to have a proper set of wheels made she said : ' i just fell in love with him pretty much instantly			1
' i know what it takes to care for a dog as special as him because i have worked with special needs pets in the past so it was just a perfect fit and i adopted him straight away			0
' the owners knew that he needed more one - on - one attention and they needed to focus on his mother and the other puppies in the litter			0
' when i took him home i made a cart for him to get around in , which i made entirely from toys but i knew he would need something a little more permanent			0
' @entity2 became an internet sensation overnight with his toy wheels but owner @entity12 knew he would need something a litter bigger as he grew older			1
owner @entity12 , from @entity57 , @entity58 , said : ' i set up an online fundraiser with a picture of @entity2 in his toy wheels asking for donations to help him get the new wheels he needed			1
despite having an initial target of just $ 600 , miss @entity12 raised more than $ 3,500			2
she was eventually contacted by a designer who offered to make a cart for turbo @entity2 was fitted with a @entity7 printed body harness with a pair of skateboard wheels attached , but still struggled to walk using it as it sagged at the back after a slight redesign , @entity73 from studio 3dyn fitted a second set of wheels to the cart ' the donations came flooding in and i was so appreciative and overwhelmed by the love and support from people			1
' it was n't long after that a man who worked for a 3d design company messaged me and said he would make @entity2 a cart			0
' i messaged him back and it was only four days later that he said he had made a rough draft cart and had sent it to us			0
' @entity12 's online campaign raised a staggering $ 3,629 ( Â£ 2,169 ) five times more than her initial $ 600 target			1
@entity73 from @entity92 - based studio 3dyn caught wind of the campaign and offered to design a set of wheels for @entity2			1
the support cart for @entity2 was made with a @entity99 3d - printer and strapped to his back			2
he was then given a set of luminous green skateboard wheels to complete his makeover			2
@entity12 said : ' @entity73 has never asked us for anything , he took @entity2 on as a special project and has not asked for any payment			2
' when i first took him home he did n't really do much but since then he has become a super cute fun loving puppy			0
@entity111 ( pictured right with @entity2 ) says @entity73 did n't charge her for the cart , so she has set the $ 3,629 donated aside for x-rays and vaccines that @entity2 will need as he gets older @entity12 ( pictured with partner @entity115 ) says that when she first got him home , @entity2 was n't able to do much , but has now grown into a fun - loving puppy @entity2 became an internet sensation after @entity118 made him a set of wheels out of spare toy parts ' he constantly plays and hops around at our @entity122 and at work when i am on my lunch and he can do so much he could not do before			1
' @entity12 has now set aside the money that was donated and hopes to use it on bone scans and vaccines that @entity2 will need as he gets older			1
she said : ' i love seeing him grow every day but just like with any puppy you do n't want them to grow up			0
but each day he does something new that makes me so proud to be his mom			0
' i want to use the money that was donated to go towards future vet visits such as x-rays and vaccines which he will need to track his bone growth because he will need medication to keep his bones strong			0
' he is just a typical chihuahua and although he has his moments where he is fussy and wants what he wants , all in all he is extremely sweet and has such a zest for life			0
