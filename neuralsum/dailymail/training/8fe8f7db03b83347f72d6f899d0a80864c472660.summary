a mother died and her daughter injured when they were struck by a runaway van which rolled down a hill , a jury heard			1
@entity5 had parked the @entity7 van on @entity8 , @entity9 while doing some electrical work at the @entity11			1
@entity12 , prosecuting , told @entity13 that @entity15 footage showed him twice returning to the vehicle and removing tools			0
@entity5 , 44 , denies causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving but around 34 minutes after he was last seen at the van it was captured moving backwards slowly down the incline , gradually increasing speed until it disappeared from view			1
at the same time , out of view below @entity26 , 46 , was crossing @entity27 with two children including her 10 - year - old daughter @entity29			1
' what then unfolded was seen by a number of witnesses and you may think must have been traumatic to view , ' said mr @entity12			2
the van with no one inside picked up speed until it reached about 15mph , careering across the road and crushing mrs @entity26 against a wall and seriously injuring @entity29			1
mr @entity12 told the jury one witness seeing the van remembered thinking to himself ' brake , brake ' as he saw what was happening but , of course , it did not			2
' witnesses at the scene immediately thought the worst , ' said mr @entity12			2
' sadly they were right			0
@entity26 sustained catastrophic internal injuries from which she could not recover			1
her daughter suffered a fractured skull			1
' people rushed to help and one man pushed the van off the pavement where it had come to rest trapping the pedestrians , others gave first aid until the ambulance and paramedics arrived			0
no one entered the van which was locked			0
while the police were there @entity5 came down the hill and went to unlock it but was moved away and the keys were taken from him			2
the van was examined by investigator @entity70 and no mechanical defect was found			0
he noticed the gear stick was in neutral and the parking brake was only partially applied on two notches out of a possible six			0
@entity5 parked his van here on @entity8 , @entity9 while doing some electrical work at the @entity11 the incline , the bottom of which was where mrs @entity26 was walking when @entity5 's hit and killed her tests showed when on four it was easily able to hold its position on the hill			1
mr @entity70 concluded the brake was not applied fully , the vehicle was left in neutral rather than forward gear and , had the full steering wheel lock engaged , the wheels would have been at an angle that would have stopped the vehicle going backwards in a straight line			0
mrs @entity26 died here ( white wall ) when she was hit by a @entity7 van @entity5 , 44 , denies causing the death of mrs @entity26 by careless or inconsiderate driving on april 26 last year			1
mr @entity12 told the jury it was the crown 's case it was still careless driving even if @entity5 was not behind the wheel at the time if it was ' careless in the way he left the vehicle '			2
he said that meant assessing how the notional competent and careful driver would have parked on a road with this degree of incline			1
' when mr @entity5 got out of the vehicle he must have appreciated just how steep this road was			1
' ' the standard of the competent and careful driver is set by the @entity117 , ' mr @entity12 added			0
@entity26 , 46 , was walking two of her children home from school when she was hit and killed by a van that rolled down the incline locals have placed flowers at the scene in @entity27 , @entity9 , @entity126 where @entity127 was killed and her daughter seriously injured when they were hit by a @entity7 van when @entity5 was interviewed he confirmed parking the van and said he was inside the college when someone shouted it was at the bottom of the hill			1
asked if he left it in gear he said he did not remember , but usually did			0
mr @entity12 told the jury it was the prosecution case he had not left the brake on fully , had left the gear in neutral and had not turned his wheel lock on fully			0
' the inescapable conclusion is that had mr @entity5 taken these precautions then this tragic collision would not have occurred , ' mr @entity12 added			2
he urged the jury to put aside any emotional response to the events			0
' such feelings are entirely understandable , ' he said			0
' it is entirely human and humane response to such a tragedy			0
' but such feelings or emotions have no part to play in your deliberations over the guilt or innocence of mr @entity5			2
