by @entity1 reporter cat owners should buy their pets bells for @entity4 said sir @entity5 if you want to savour the twittering of birds in your garden , you might have to get used to the occasional tinkling as well			1
buying your cat a collar with a bell is the best way to give birds a boost in the battle for survival over the winter			2
that ’s the advice from sir @entity5 , whose love for birds is behind his tweet of the day programme for @entity25			1
the @entity4 edition will feature the distinctive call of the robin , the star of @entity4 cards the world over and a symbol of the festive season			0
sir @entity5 , 87 , explained that pretty images of friendly robins hopping about in the snow hid the reality of a desperate battle to survive the cold months , when food is scarce and danger is everywhere – especially with cats on the prowl			1
‘ cats kill an extraordinarily high number of birds in @entity49 gardens , ’ he told the @entity44			1
asked whether cat owners should buy bell collars for their pets at @entity4 , he replied : ‘ that would be good for the robins , yes			2
the robin almost certainly evolved a relationship with animals such as wild pigs , which grub around in the earth looking for tubers			0
@entity61 would have followed in their wake , picking up beetles and worms			0
‘ and the likelihood is – though nobody can prove it – that when human beings started cutting down forests and planting fields , the robin moved over from the pigs and took up mankind as a companion			0

the 87 - year - old 's love of birds is shared on his tweet of the day programme on @entity25 sir @entity5 said pretty images of robins hopping about in the snow hid the reality of how dangerous the winter months can be for the birds ‘ that ’s why , if you ’re digging in the garden , a robin will often pop up – and it will appear to be very brave , because it ’ll pick up worms and beetle grubs from around your feet			1
and that ’s very endearing , is n’t it ? ’ cats , however , are best kept at a distance			2
according to the most recent figures from the @entity108 , cats catch up to 55million birds a year			2
which is where the bell collar comes in			0
it is the best protection for birds in the garden , giving them ample warming that danger is prowling their way			2
in a wide - ranging interview , sir @entity5 also warned that scientists should abandon attempts to bring extinct species such as the woolly mammoth back to life			1
@entity129 scientists recently extracted the bone marrow from mammoth remains with a view to resurrecting the creature , in a real - life echo of the movie @entity136			0
but sir @entity5 , who encounters extinct animals in a new @entity139 documentary using special effects , said : ‘ i think it could conceivably happen , but to what end ? ' we ’ve got quite enough problems saving the species we ’ve got without bringing old ones back			1
’ sir @entity5 also suggested that conservationists should n’t focus on particular species dying out			1
he said : ‘ it ’s very easy to say “ the giant panda ’s disappearing ”			0
what you should be saying is that the ecosystem of which the giant panda is only a part is disappearing			0

sir @entity5 said cats kill ' extraordinarily high ' number of birds
robins face particular danger in winter when food is scarce
