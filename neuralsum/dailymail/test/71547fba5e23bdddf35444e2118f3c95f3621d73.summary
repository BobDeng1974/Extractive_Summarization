speaking about how she developed a passion for health and fitness , @entity2 , 23 , said : ' i 'm motivated by people around me and i just got to a point in my life where i needed a change			1
' trainer and nutritionist , @entity74 , who owns @entity75 in @entity76 and trains @entity2 , said : ' @entity2 and i met when we worked together on the made in @entity2 fitness dvd			1
' @entity2 was one of the cast members who took part in my workout			2
after the dvd , she wanted to continue with her training and i asked to work with her			0
' @entity2 models cut - out swimwear and kaftans that the brand say are perfect for taking you from the beach to balmy evenings in the bar discussing @entity2 's physique and fitness before they met , @entity74 said : ' @entity2 has always had a naturally lean body , which is thanks to her being active growing up and taking part in gymnastics and dance			1
' she also leads a fairly healthy lifestyle and pays attention to what she eats			0
her fitness levels were n’t terrible but they also were n’t where they could have been , which is probably due to her filming schedule but we all have periods where work or life take a front seat and exercise a back one			0
' @entity2 , who cites her role model as ' amazing ' @entity111 , said she found working out ' boring ' and ' difficult ' at first because she had such a busy schedule that she found it hard to get into a routine			2
@entity2 's typical workout incorporates a squat or a deadlift , both of which are great for toning legs and glutes she said : ' my days are always different and i could never get properly into it			1
i think it 's just wanting those improvements with your body and health in general that motivated me			0
' @entity2 says she likes exercise ' where you do n't even realise you 're exercising ' , like tennis or horse riding			2
but , she says , thanks to @entity74 , who is always changing it up and is fun to be around , she never gets bored any more			0
' i do n't want to emulate anyone else 's body , ' she admits			0
' i just want mine to be toned and lean			0
i do n't want to lose any weight or curves , just tone up what i already have			0
i also want to increase my strength			0
' so how can we emulate her taut stomach ? @entity74 said : ' @entity2 has a great flat tummy but is n’t looking for washboard abs. in our sessions , we concentrate on a mixture of core exercises like planks and side planks as these help to pull in your waist			2
' we then add lower ab exercises such as reverse crunches as lower abs are often overlooked			0
on top of this , we add rotational movements such as seated twists			0
this ensures @entity2 has both a flat stomach and a strong core for the bigger exercises such as squats and deadlifts			2
' he added : ' @entity2 also ensures her diet is clean , luckily there was n’t much we needed to change but its true what they say , abs are built in the gym but revealed in the kitchen			2
' @entity74 and @entity2 's typical workout will incorporate a big lift such as a squat or a deadlift , both of which are great for toning legs and glutes			1
@entity2 showed off her style credentials at the @entity188 show in @entity76 last week @entity2 has also been following a healthy diet , which she posts on her @entity191 page , to complement her fitness regime			1
as her trainer says , abs are built in the gym but revealed in the kitchen the duo then follow this up with mini circuits concentrating on working the body in single leg movements such as walking lunges and upper body push and pull exercises like press - ups			0
' every session is a full body session to keep her body balanced and injury - free and we often throw in @entity210 ( high intensity interval training ) finishers to add in a cardio element , ' he said			0
@entity74 believes that , like @entity2 , more and more women are embracing weight training , which he thinks is , in part , due to some ' fantastic and beautiful athletic role models out there '			2
he added : ' everyone trains for different reasons			0
there are strong people , there are skinny people , but what is important is that people are allowed to feel comfortable in their bodies			0
having people like @entity2 show young females that you can enjoy life , eat well , train and reap the rewards is great			1
