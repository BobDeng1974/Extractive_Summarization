mr @entity2 said he had been reassured personally by @entity9 that he did not know his close friend and ally @entity11 was bankrolling a series of polls designed to prove the @entity5 were doomed with him still as leader			1
in an attempt to draw a line under the threat to his position , mr @entity2 put on a confident display during his weekly radio phone - in , denying he had cried after his election drubbing and demonstrating to @entity22 how to eat a bacon sandwich			0
@entity11 , mr @entity3 ’s closest ally and holiday partner , warned that the party is ‘ heading for disaster ’ under mr @entity2			1
and he claimed mr @entity3 knew all about secret polling he commissioned in @entity5 seats to show they would do better without mr @entity2 as leader			1
it followed mr @entity3 ’s insistence that the ordering the polling was ‘ utterly reprehensible ’			2
last night the business secretary was forced to break off from a trade visit to @entity50 to deny again having knowledge of his friend ’s plot			2
today mr @entity2 insisted that he believed his colleague , as he desperately tried to move on from the most damaging period of his turbulent time leadership			2
but he was forced to deny crying before giving an emotional interview in the wake of dire local and @entity60 election results , as the row about the future direction of the @entity5 threatens to split the party in two			1
plotter : @entity11 emerged from his home this morning , the first time he has been seen in public since his attempts to undermine mr @entity2 were exposed @entity2 today denied he had been crying before an emotional interview in the wake of his elections bloodbath , the @entity5 lost more than 300 councillors and all but one of its meps in local and @entity60 elections			1
as the scale of the devastation became clear , and calls from activists grew for him to resign , mr @entity2 gave a tv interview in which he appeared emotional			0

asked if he had been crying , mr @entity2 insisted : ' of course not			1
' when it was suggested by @entity86 host @entity85 ' your eyes were red ' , he responded ' were they ? ' before trying to change the subject			0
the deputy prime minister insisted he did not believe ‘ for a second ’ that mr @entity3 had been behind the plot to force him out of the party 's top job			1
during his regular @entity97 show on @entity86 he said : ‘ he was absolutely not aware of polls elsewhere			0
he has made it very , very clear that he , for instance , did n't want any questions about leadership in the poll which he did have some control over in his own constituency			0
‘ so , look i fully expect that people will try and suggest that there are endless plots and conspiracies			0
i do n't believe that for a second			0
@entity3 is an outstanding secretary of state for business			0
‘ he and i have worked together for years and years and years and we are going to continue to work together in harness as part of a really strong @entity5 team in government			0

but when asked if the @entity5 were heading for disaster under mr @entity2 , mr @entity3 replied : ‘ i 'm not going to give ad hoc answers			1
’ however , mr @entity3 has faced intense criticism for his failure to tell mr @entity2 what he knew about the polling work being carried out by @entity11			1
he admits knowing about polls in his own @entity130 seat and in @entity131 in @entity132 , and knew that @entity11 was looking to establish if the party would perform better without mr @entity2 at the helm			1
sir @entity135 , who lost his seat as an mep in last week 's elections , said mr @entity3 had shown ' treachery ' by not ordering friend to halt the polling immediately			1
he told @entity142 's today programme : ' of course it is the case that sometimes we can be as treacherous as our failure to stop something as we can by being involved but @entity3 s doing an incredibly taxing and busy job and nobody believes that he is trying undermine @entity85			2
' maybe he should have said to @entity11 , very early on , " @entity11 this is not a good idea , do n’t do it and if you want to do it my constituency fine , but do n’t do it elsewhere			2
" clearly he did n’t			0
