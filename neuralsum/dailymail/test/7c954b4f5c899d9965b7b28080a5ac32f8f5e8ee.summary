a 77 - year - old woman was left partially blind after a lightning bolt struck her as she sat in her car			1
despite the dramatic and rare event , the woman 's injury was not detected straight away			0
rather , her hairdresser noticed several days later that she had suffered minor burns on her scalp			1
later that day the pensioner noticed her eye sight was blurred - she could barely see with her right eye			1
a few days later , she visited the opticians and was referred to see opthalmologist @entity13 , who works at @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16			1
the 77 - year - old woman was struck by lightning while she sat in her car			1
days later , after her vision became blurred , a scan of her retina revealed she had a hole in her retina mr @entity13 scanned the patient 's retina , using a relatively new technique known as optical coherence tomography ( @entity27 )			1
the case report into the woman 's treatment , published by the journal @entity32 , reveals mr @entity13 discovered a hole in the patient 's macula , a part of the retina that is responsible for around 90 per cent of a person 's vision			2
dr @entity40 , a medical internist and colleague of mr @entity13 , said the woman 's case reveals how important it is that medics check the vision of anyone struck by lightning			2
he told @entity49 : ' in the future , if patients are struck by lightning , it should be a routine process to refer them to an ophthalmologist to have an eye assessment			2
' he said the retina does not conduct electricity well , suggesting the injury was caused by the heat produced when the bolt struck			1
the woman was prescribed eye drops , but suffered an allergic reaction to them			0
she later underwent surgery to repair the hole in her macula , after two months of poor vision			0
dr @entity40 , a medical internist at @entity14 in @entity15 , said the heat from the lightning bolt is thought to have burned a hole in the woman 's retina			1
it was eventually treated , via surgery the operation involved removing the jelly part of the eye , which touches the retina , and injecting a gas bubble to push the layer at the back of the eye back together , dr @entity40 said			0
he added his patient was ' quite fortunate in that only her retina was affected , and only in one eye '			0
between 30 to 60 people each year are struck by lightning in the @entity91			2
meanwhile across the @entity93 , the @entity92 sees an average of 51 people injured by lightning each year			0
only around 10 per cent of those struck by a bolt are killed			0
dr @entity40 said there have been reports of lightning strikes affecting other parts of the eyes , resulting in cataracts , burns or swelling .			0
