police snoopers are capturing phone data from tens of thousands of innocent people , allowing officers to listen to calls , block phone signal , and even send fake text messages , it has been claimed			1
controversial @entity9 catchers are being used by the @entity10 , the country 's largest force , to spy on suspects ' mobile phones , according to reports			2
but the devices also ' hoover up ' data from every other mobile within their range , meaning thousands of innocent people are being unintentionally targeted			2
the @entity10 , the country 's biggest force , use devices known as @entity9 catchers to target criminals ' mobiles , but the probes also ' hoover up ' all phone data from the surrounding area the devices are regularly used by the @entity10 in large scale investigations , and are thought to be used by the @entity31 , according to @entity32			1
for a mobile phone to work , it needs to transmit data between your handset and the nearest mobile phone mast , which will connect it to the rest of the network			2
@entity44 catchers work by jumping into this stream of data , allowing the device to monitor everything that is sent between mobiles and a specific phone mast			1
police will then be able to see a handset 's @entity52 - along with the @entity53 ( @entity53 ) , allowing them to identify the owner			0
@entity9 catchers then have the ability to monitor data sent to and from the handset , listen in to phone calls , block mobile signal , or send fake text message to or from the phone			1
as the devices are relatively new , their use is not covered by a specific law , and instead falls under the @entity67 which is usually used to allow police to install bugs in someone 's home			0
the use of such devices can be approved by an officer of chief constable rank , without the need for a judge or government minister to approve			0
@entity80 and the @entity31 have both refused to discuss when or why they use the devices , and what type of data they gather			0
police numbers show that officers used ' property interference ' techniques 2,689 times in the last year , but this data will include conventional bug microphones and other such devices			2
@entity44 catchers allow officers to listen in to phone calls , block signal to a handset , read messages , and also send fake texts to and from the handset ( posed by model ) @entity99 , advocacy officer for @entity100 , told @entity32 : ' you can not maintain this level of secrecy and claim that we still have policing by consent			1
' this technology is not capable of targeting an individual			0
the latest @entity44 catchers can unmask entire groups involved in protests , intercept all their messages and block all their calls			1
' a @entity80 spokesman told @entity115 that the force will neither confirm nor deny whether the equipment is used - or whether the force even has it			0
at the time of publishing , the @entity31 was unavailable for comment .			0

@entity44 catchers mimic phone masts and intercept data sent from handsets
used to spy on criminals but allow officers to see all data within range
police can use *hardware* to listen to calls , block signal , and send texts
