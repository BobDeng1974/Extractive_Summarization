by @entity0 at the beginning of this month , my youngest child , @entity1 , started school			1
her tiny hand clutched mine as i urged her into the reception class and hung the blazer that swamps her still - tiny frame on to a peg			2
then , steeling myself , i quickly departed to brave the inevitable huddle of sobbing mothers in the playground - all bereft that their days of toddler groups and coffee mornings had finally come to an end			2
by rights , i should have joined them in shedding a tear or two			0
@entity1 is , after all , my fourth and last child			1
she is also , having just turned four at the end of august , the youngest in the entire school			1
school run sadness : @entity0 with @entity1 , who 's just turned four but is already going to school yet distraught was the very furthest from how i felt			1
as i gave these women a cheery wave my , actual , overriding thought was : ' hurrah ! that 's the last one out of my hair			2
' so why have i decided to make @entity1 start school even though she still requires a dummy for comfort and wears nappies every night ? the answer 's simple			1
after 14 years of fitting my writing career around my brood 's needs , i 've had enough			2
the main reason she 's going to school is because , shamefully , it makes my life a hell of a lot easier			1
i know this makes me sound heartless			2
even i 'm surprised at my behaviour			0
especially because the entire reason we decided to have @entity1 was so that i could give up work and savour every precious moment with one last child			1
she was born in august 2009 - almost seven years after the youngest of her siblings : @entity54 , ten , @entity53 , 12 , and @entity55 , 14			1
after the madness of having three children so close together i craved to experience motherhood at a leisurely pace			0
i desperately wanted to try the whole stay - at - home thing			1
but then money worries drove me back to work when she was just ten weeks old			0
poor @entity1 went to nursery and i went back to my laptop			2
perhaps if i 'd been a hands - on mother from the off , spending my days doing nothing more stressful than making things out of @entity70 , i might feel differently now			2
but the truth is that for me , and the majority of working mothers in the @entity74 , the start of school comes as a blessed relief because it allows us - by law and general acceptance - to get on with our jobs with far less hassle and expense			2
today , there 's no escaping the sense of freedom i feel at being able to drive away from the school drop - off knowing that the last of my offspring is squirrelled away for the next six hours and the day is all mine			1
there are no complicated childcare arrangements to arrange and no guilt to contend with			0
i have convinced myself that my darling little girl is exactly where she should be			0
so imagine my shock when i read last week that a coalition of education experts are now calling for full - time school to be delayed - by an astonishing three years			1
liberating : @entity0 loves the sense of freedom sending @entity1 off to school gives her the @entity101 , which has launched a @entity102 , firmly believes that the current @entity74 education system is causing young children ' profound damage ' , because they are not being encouraged to learn through play			1
apparently the pressure of being in a classroom is too stressful for four years olds like @entity1			2
what they would like to see is for full - time school to be delayed - as it is in countries like @entity114 - until a child is six or seven			1
firstly , have none of these experts ever tried to hold down a job while juggling the demands and eye - watering cost ( more expensive than private school ) of a pre-schooler needing childcare ? and , secondly , do n't they know that @entity114 has one of the highest rates of alcoholism in the whole of @entity129 ? i 'll wager there 's a connection there			1
every working mother in @entity74 knows how stressful it is to continue a career with a small person metaphorically - and literally - clinging to your skirt hems			0
booting them out to full - time education a little early is surely preferable to hitting the bottle ? yet many will argue that i am a bad mother for shunting my daughter through a system she does n't even - legally - have to be in yet			1
and i 'd probably concede they have a point			0
you just have to look at @entity1 's furrowed brow in the mornings , or the fact she falls asleep on the sofa at 6pm before i ’ve even put her in the bath and read her a story			1
after her first day at school she came home , wide - eyed with horror			1
' if you do something naughty you get a red card , ' she whispered , terrified			0
i still have no idea what a red card means because @entity1 's too little to understand herself			1
i could , of course , keep her at home			0
current @entity74 law dictates that a child does n't have to be in full - time education until they are five			1
yet you are strongly encouraged to start your children the september after their fourth birthday , and most parents happily oblige			0
either they 're like me - desperate to claw back some career credibility - or just so competitive they ca n't bear the idea of their child being on an educational back foot because they 've started behind their classmates			0
we 've gone private , which has afforded us some flexibility on the matter			0
the school 's attitude is that i 'm a paying customer and can therefore call the shots			2
they 've been amazing in their approach , telling me i can dip @entity1 in and out of her reception year however it best suits me			2
i can keep her home a day a week or pick her up early if she seems a little tired			0
but friends with children in the state sector have n't been so lucky			0
some primary schools do stagger entry for summer babies allowing them to attend for half days until january - but after that they 're just expected to get with the programme			0
i know , deep down , that @entity1 is n’t ready for school			1
but so liberating does it feel to get my life back that , despite the school 's offer , i plonk her at their gates at 8.30am every morning , when i drop off her older brother and sister , and do n't return to collect her until 5pm			1
while the school day finishes at 4pm , she does an hour of after - school clubs so i can pick her up at the same time as her siblings			1
late starters as well as @entity217 , children in @entity216 and @entity114 do n't start school until they ’re seven i did , at the start of term , flirt with the idea of keeping her home on , say , a wednesday , but it 's amazing how my week fills up			1
i 'm not saying i do n't feel guilty			0
on the drive to school , @entity1 sucks desperately on her dummy like a death row prisoner having his last fag			1
as we arrive and i try to prise it from her mouth she begs : ' one last suck , @entity234 , ' before dejectedly leaving it behind in her car seat			0
of course , i adore my daughter and want to hang on to her early years as long as i possibly can			0
i also have a 14 - year - old teenage girl , so i know how fast it whizzes by			0
and it does , occasionally , tear at my heartstrings when i drop her off in the morning and turn back to see her standing , stoically , in the centre of the playground			0
she looks so small , so unsure what to do amid the throng of much older , bigger and more boisterous children			0
several times i have even been tempted to rush back , scoop her up in my arms and take her home for a day of cuddles and mummy time			2
but then i remember i need a quiet day to meet my deadlines			0
so this morning i entered her bedroom with my usual sense of purpose , trying to ignore the fact she was on her stomach , just as she slept when she was a baby , her knees drawn up under her			0
' come on @entity1 , ' i said , pulling back the duvet			2
' it 's time for school			1
' she opened both eyes , looked at me sorrowfully and said : ' but @entity234 , i already went , yesterday			0
' i just did n't have the heart to break the news to her that yes - despite this indisputable fact - she has to go today , and tomorrow , too .			0

@entity1 turned four in august and still wears nappies
she 's *overwhelmed* at being at school
she attends full - time even though she could stay at home
@entity0 said it 's because ' shamefully , it makes my life a hell of a lot easier '
