@entity1 's most expensive one - bedroom flat has gone on the market for £ 10million			1
the luxury flat at one @entity4 has been dubbed the ultimate ' @entity5 ' and is so expensive that a simple waste bin takes up £ 6,300 worth of space			1
but there will be no room for guests at the property , which is regarded as the finest one - bedroom home in the world 's priciest apartment block			1
the lower level of the duplex apartment is the sleeping area and boasts a huge double bedroom with en - suite bathroom			2
upstairs is for socialising , with the area dominated by an open - plan living and dining room			0
there is also a separate toilet			0
it works out at £ 6,300 per square foot and is £ 4.3 million more than the next most expensive one - bedroom property in the capital			1
and while large properties have sold for this £ per sq / ft price before , figures from @entity50 , which tracks the property market , has a top one - bedroom price of £ 5,035 per sq / ft. the kitchen , which measures a modest 12 ' 11 x 8 ' 10 , takes up around £ 700,000 of space - the same amount as a large family home in most cities			1

they also have to pay £ 2,000 per year in ground rent along with a £ 32,000 annual service charge			2

residents get 24 - hour @entity77 - trained security , an in - house maid service , same day laundry and dry cleaning , room service from the @entity83 hotel and a private temperature controlled wine store			1
the huge price tag of the property - which is down the road from @entity89 - means it works out at £ 6,300 per square foot as well as a large bedroom , living room and kitchen , the two - storey exclusive apartment also includes a separate bathroom the development also has ' unmatched leisure and entertainment facilities ' which includes a private spa , 21 - metre swimming pool , sauna , steam room , squash court and cinema			1
@entity105 , an independent property consultant , has been inside one @entity4 and deals in the super-prime market			2
he said : ' it is an amazing place and it is not like buying a one - bedroom flat			1
it is a very modern , high quality build , you have the @entity83 next door and the ultimate concierge			0
' the sort of person who will look at it is likely to be the sort of person who spends a lot of time in a hotel			0
but for £ 10 million you could get quite a few nights in the finest hotel suite			0
' the bar in residential development keeps being raised			0
what you lack in @entity38 are the locations to build on , which is why they can charge such a price at one @entity4			2
' will the quality of developments improve ? yes , but it is highly unlikely you find a better location			0

for them , the value with the bragging rights to their friends or impressionable girlfriend is often much more than the price			0
' the duplex apartment is on the market with @entity176 's @entity40 office and also benefits from an underground parking space			0
@entity178 , a partner at the estate agency , said : ' one @entity4 is commonly regarded as the best new residential building in @entity38 , if not the world			1
' the most expensive apartment to sell in one @entity4 was a penthouse , which was bought for £ 140 million last year			1
plans show the limited size of the apartment - but property experts say the ' bragging rights ' of owning a flat in the building will attract the rich while £ 10million only buys you a one - bedroom flat in central @entity38 's most exclusive apartment block , the same amount can buy you considerably more elsewhere in the world			1
a 300 - acre estate , which includes three miles of beautiful @entity199 coastline , recently went up for sale on the island of @entity202			0

four @entity222 castles - boasting a combined 40 bedrooms and acres of land including coastline - are on the market each for less than £ 2million - meaning a buyer could purchase all four and still get change from £ 10million			2
in 2013 , an entire @entity229 village , @entity230 , consisting of 25 homes , a pub and a shop was put on the market valued at £ 10million			0

a nine - bedroom regency house in @entity242 with 19 acres , was recently valued at just over £ 9.5million and @entity243 , a ten - bedroom country estate near @entity245 with 278 acres is worth just over £ 8million			1
for those who do n't want to get tied down to a mortgage , £ 10million could buy 7,279 nights - 20 years - staying in the @entity249 at @entity38 's @entity251 hotel , with breakfast			1
