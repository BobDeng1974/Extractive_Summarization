swollen breasts , the constant urge to wee and broken nights are problems expectant mums know all too well and men have been unable to share - until now			1
so what happened when three dads became nine months pregnant ? @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 are discovering exactly what it 's like to have a baby on board by wearing pregnancy suits to honour mums in the run up to @entity19 on sunday , march 15			1
currently on day eight of the project , the publishing directors , are charting the ups and downs of impending parenthood in an online diary			2
@entity10 , 46 , who is married to @entity34 and has a 12 - year - old son , called @entity33 , said : ' every day things like putting on your socks becomes a monumental task			1
' the trio , who are from @entity53 but all work at an office in @entity56 , are wearing their bumps to work , to the pub and to bed and are only allowed to remove them to wash			1
@entity9 , 44 , who is a father - of - one mused on day five : ' i wonder why pregnant women do n't use wheelchairs			1
' ' i have a chair in the office with wheels and this is a blessing			2
i can glide effortlessly across the office to my desired destination			2
' the trio are wearing their bumps to work , to the pub and to bed and are only allowed to remove them to wash ' on day three i did n't sleep a wink , i just could n't get settled , ' says company director @entity10 , from @entity77 , pictured on his laptop while wearing the belly @entity10 's son @entity33 is pictured resting his head on his fake breasts , making for quite the funny sight but it 's not all fun and games			1
the ' empathy belly ' comes complete with fake breasts and weighs two and a half stone - the average weight of a full term baby bump			1
it is designed to put pressure on the bladder , stomach and lungs , and cause abdominal distention and the inability to get comfortable			2
' on day three i did n't sleep a wink , i just could n't get settled , ' said company director @entity10 , from @entity77			0
' my boobs , which at first were quite a pleasurable novelty , soon became about as welcome as a fart in a spacesuit , ' said @entity10 ( pictured in his ' empathy belly ' ) ' i wonder why pregnant women do n't use wheelchairs , ' dad - of - one @entity9 , 44 , ( pictured ) wrote in his diary the suit weighs 33lb , the average weight of a full term baby , and is designed to cause abdominal distention and put pressure on the bladder , stomach and lungs ' i tried to make a small city out of pillows around my bump			1
my boobs , which at first were quite a pleasurable novelty , soon became about as welcome as a fart in a spacesuit , ' he added			0
' they were way too warm and hung on my arm , sending it to sleep and waking me at the same time			0
' by day three the constant swinging motion of his belly forced @entity11 , 45 , from @entity127 to visit his local pharmacy and seek medical help			0
' i unzipped my jacket , exposing my belly and explaining my predicament to the woman behind the counter , ' says @entity11 , dad to @entity135 , five , and @entity136 , one			0
' i expected her to crack a smile or reel back in shock but she nodded professionally like she 's seen it all before , opened a drawer and placed an elastic waist strap on the counter			0
despite the trials and tribulations caused by faking pregnancy , the @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity9 said it has made them appreciate what their wives have had to go through ' a few minutes later , with belly strapped firmly in place , i waltzed out of there with a new - found spring in my stride			1
it was wonderful , i could move again			0
' yet despite the trials and tribulations just one week in @entity10 admits to bonding with his ' baby '			2
he told his diary : ' it seems to be taking on a personality			0
it has a name , and its name is bump			0
i cradle it , pat it , rub it and i just caught myself talking to it while patting it			0
' as well as writing down their experiences the dads are also uploading videos of their pregnancy journeys to their online diaries - and all three are looking forward to @entity19 when they can remove the suits for good			1
' huge respect goes to all you pregnant mums out there			2
every single one of you , ' said @entity10 .			0
