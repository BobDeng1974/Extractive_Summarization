@entity1 creator @entity0 has made millions from merchandise on the back of his famous films , but even he would surely never have dreamt of this			0
a @entity8 fast food chain has revealed a promotional snack which really has gone to the @entity10 , a @entity1 - inspired burger with completely black buns			1
the burger chain @entity15 cooked up the black - looking bun - named @entity17 - to tie in with the release of @entity13 : @entity13 in @entity19			2
@entity20 : the @entity1 burger has a distinctly overdone look although the buns look like decidedly burned , they are in fact simply dyed , and have two beef patties with cheese , lettuce and tomato inbetween			0
the relevance is questionable given that @entity17 only appears in @entity13 as 10 - year - old @entity17			2
as well as the @entity17 burger , @entity15 have also created an only - slightly - more appealing @entity33 burger , and a @entity34 , based on @entity35			2
these are n't the burgers you 're looking for : the @entity17 burger features completely black buns , which are dyed rather than burnt			0
the meals will be served until march 1 this year - although any brits who have ever had to fill up at the fast food outlets on long journeys around the country may decide they are yet another reason to steer clear			1
the stunt is not the first time the @entity8 fast food chain have raised eyebrows with their promotional material			1
in february 2010 the chain decided to serve only halal meat in eight restaurants , sparking criticism from politicians that its menu discriminates against @entity59			0
would you like fries with that mr @entity17 : whether the sith lord , pictured here in @entity64 , would approve of a burger in his name is debateable the @entity8 chain previously raised eyebrows when it introduced halal - only menus in february last year and in november 2010 , @entity15 said it intended to offer foie gras ' burgers ' at bargain prices as a treat for customers ahead of @entity77			1
@entity15 's ' @entity78 ' consisted of the normally expensive duck foie gras , beef , relish and lettuce and go on sale for only 5 euros ( $ 6.57 ) at more than 350 outlets across @entity8 .			0
