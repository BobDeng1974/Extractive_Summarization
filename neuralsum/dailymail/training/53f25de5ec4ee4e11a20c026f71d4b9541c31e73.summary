by @entity0 controversial : @entity1 who wishes to exercise rights granted back in 1773 a ' @entity4 ' has upset his neighbours in a @entity7 village by suddenly deciding that he wants to exercise ancient rights granted back in 1773			1
villagers in @entity10 were informed that that @entity1 and his mother @entity11 wanted to invoke a manorial right to ‘ hunt , shoot and fish ’ on their land			1
nearly 700 letters have been sent out by the @entity19 after the @entity20 's requested their so - called ‘ profit - à - prendre ( right to take			1
) this law legally entitles them to ‘ a right of hunting , hawking , fishing and fowling ’ as well as 38 further stipulations known as ' @entity29			2
' they include the right to extract minerals			2
one resident , retired call centre manager @entity33 said : ' the rights have not been used for 200 years and the whole nature of the parish has changed enormously			1
it ’s totally inappropriate in this day and age			2
' i ’d like to know what this means			2
it ’s worrying , especially if they also grant a right to extract minerals			0
@entity46 , a teacher , said : ' i ’m flabbergasted			0
' it ’s worrying that people are only being given three weeks by the @entity19 to respond to the letters with their objections			1
' paper mill worker @entity51 , said the letter had left him feeling ‘ anger and annoyance ’			0
' i think this is taking a liberty			0
i can only imagine they ’ve gone to this trouble because there ’s some financial gain to be had			0
' the @entity10 rights were originally granted by @entity62 , of @entity63 - by @entity64 , to @entity65 , @entity66 , and @entity67 , in 1773			1
disputed land : residents have reacted furiously after being informed that the @entity20 family wanted to invoke an ancient manorial right to ' hunt , shoot and fish ' on their land backdated : the manorial rights for @entity77 were acquired by mr @entity20 's great - grandfather , @entity78 , when he bought @entity10 @entity79 from the @entity81 family in the 1920s @entity10 @entity83 has been a grade 2 listed building since 1952			1
the oldest part of the building is the hall block , which dates from the 14th century			0
the pele tower was added later , probably during the early part of the 15th century , and is the right hand wing of the photo			0
records state that there was another tower on this site , and a curtain wall			0
there was a court room in the right hand tower , where local @entity100 were tried in the early days of the breakaway religion			0
the name @entity77 is derived from ' @entity104 ’s town ' or ' @entity104 ’s farm ' , and from @entity106 , an earlier owner of the manorial area			0
@entity108 ( 1680 - 1690s ) describes it as ' an old rambling house with ( a ) slender tower ouer the @entity112 '			0
this may imply a gatehouse , in which case this may have been a courtyard house			0
an indenture from the time says the @entity120 of @entity121 were purchased by the men for ‘ three thousand and five hundred and thirteen pounds eight shillings and one penny half - penny ’			0
the manorial rights for @entity77 were acquired by mr @entity20 ’s great - grandfather , @entity78 , when he bought @entity10 @entity79 from the @entity81 family in the 1920s			1
yesterday , mr @entity20 insisted the application had been made to prevent ‘ long - held rights being lost ’ , and was ‘ not a precursor to any greater use ’ of them			1
mr @entity20 , of @entity133 , said : ' the current letters being sent out by the @entity19 reflect that we are reacting to the change in the law in order to protect an asset			1
' the application being made is not a precursor to any greater use of these long - held rights , and the reason for the registration exercise is simply as a reaction to the change in the law to prevent the rights being lost			1
' due to the change , a large number of estates and other manorial owners are actively undertaking similar exercises to register their rights prior to october 2013			1
' my mother @entity11 is in the process of transferring these rights to me			2
' upset residents : from left to right - @entity33 , @entity160 and @entity46			2
mr @entity51 said : ' i think this is taking a liberty			0
i can only imagine they 've gone to this trouble because there 's some financial gain to be had ' under the @entity169 , the protected status of manorial rights will cease after october 2013 , unless owners seek to register , or otherwise protect , them			2
the @entity19 yesterday confirmed an application had been received from the @entity173 , and it was in the process of sending out letters to all property and land owners in @entity178			1
@entity179 and @entity133 mp @entity180 has written to the @entity19 asking for an extension of the time limit for responses to give @entity10 residents a chance to organise a community response			1
he also wants all relevant documents to be made available for inspection in @entity189 , rather than @entity190 .			0

letters have been sent to 700 villagers in @entity10 , @entity194 , *warning* them that the @entity4 wants to exercise ancient rights
residents were *contacted* by the @entity19 after @entity199 and her son @entity200 , a land agent , applied to invoke their rights
