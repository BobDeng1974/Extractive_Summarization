by @entity0 published : 07:38 est , 7 may 2012 updated : 07:40 est , 7 may 2012 ' asteroid defence ' has always focused on huge weaponry such as nuclear warheads or lasers - but @entity6 researchers believe throwing a handful of rocks could do the trick instead			1
two engineers at the @entity6 think that instead of the huge , cumbersome laser weapons proposed by earlier projects , a ' swarm ' of tiny spacecraft weighing 1,000lbs would deflect it			2
speaking at a conference in @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 , the two engineers propose a ' swarm ' of solar - powered pebbles could deflect an asteroid by 22,000 miles - enough to miss @entity24 entirely			1
two engineers at the @entity6 think that instead of the huge , cumbersome laser weapons proposed by earlier projects , a ' swarm ' of tiny spacecraft weighing 1,000lbs would deflect it @entity30 in @entity31 : the swarm would be launched into orbit in a single rocket , @entity32 reports - then would form into a ' swarm ' that would attack a 250m space rock head on dr @entity20 , of @entity38 , is leading the research the swarm would be launched into orbit in a single rocket , @entity32 reports - then would form into a ' swarm ' that would attack a 250m space rock head on			1
until now , research into an ' asteroid shield ' for our planet has focused on huge satellites carrying equally vast weapons			1
but @entity6 researchers think that smaller ' fighter ' satellites could work together to destroy a huge asteroid			2
dr @entity20 , of @entity6 ’s @entity38 , is also researching another approach , where the small satellites would be armed with lasers , rather than using impact to deflect the asteroid			1
instead of knocking it off course , small laser satellites would ' chew away ' at an approaching space rock			0
he said : ‘ the approach we are developing would involve sending small satellites , capable of flying in formation with the asteroid and firing their lasers at the asteroid at close range			1
‘ the use of high power lasers in space for civil and commercial applications is in its infancy and one of the main challenges is to have high power , high efficiency and high beam quality all at the same time			2
‘ the additional problem with asteroid deflection is that when the laser begins to break down the surface of the object , the plume of gas and debris impinges the spacecraft and contaminates the laser			2
' however , our laboratory tests have proven that the level of contamination is less than expected and the laser could continue to function for longer than anticipated			0
’ a swarm of relatively small satellites flying in formation and cooperatively firing solar - powered lasers onto an asteroid would overcome the difficulties associated with current methods that are focused on large unwieldy spacecraft			1
ever watchful : the @entity104 's @entity103 scans the skies for dangerous space rocks @entity107 's the limit : the @entity103 is located on @entity109			0
@entity110 in the @entity111 just north of @entity112 , @entity31 just over 100 years ago a 2000 - kilometer area of vegetation was destroyed when an object believed to be 30 - 50 metres in diameter exploded in the skies above @entity118 , @entity119			1
dr @entity20 said : ‘ the @entity118 class of events are expected to occur within a period of a few centuries			0
' smaller asteroids collide with @entity24 more frequently and generally burn in the atmosphere although some of them reach the ground or explode at low altitude potentially causing damage to buildings and people			1
‘ we could reduce the threat posed by the potential collision with small to medium size objects using a flotilla of small agile spacecraft each equipped with a highly efficient laser which is much more feasible than a single large spacecraft carrying a multi mega watt			0
' our system is scalable , a larger asteroid would require adding one or more spacecraft to the flotilla , and intrinsically redundant - if one spacecraft fails the others can continue			1
’ dr @entity20 is now investigating the use of the same concept to remove space debris			0
the number of objects in orbit classified as debris is ever - increasing and with no widely accepted solution for their removal			0
researchers at the @entity6 believe the space - borne lasers could be used to lower the original orbit of the space debris and reduce the congestion			2
dr @entity20 said : ‘ the amount of debris in orbit is such that we might experience a so called @entity171 syndrome – this is when the density becomes so high that collisions between objects could cause an exponentially increasing cascade of other collisions			0
‘ while there is significant monitoring in place to keep track of these objects , there is no specific system in place to remove them and our research could be a possible solution			0
‘ a major advantage of using our technique is that the laser does not have to be fired from the ground			0
obviously there are severe restrictions with that process as it has to travel through the atmosphere , has a constrained range of action and can hit the debris only for short arcs			0

' *squadron* ' of ' pebble ' sized asteroids would deflect asteroid
would need to be launched 8 years in advance
could deflect asteroid 22,000 miles - and make it miss @entity24
*previous* research focused on large craft with equally large lasers
