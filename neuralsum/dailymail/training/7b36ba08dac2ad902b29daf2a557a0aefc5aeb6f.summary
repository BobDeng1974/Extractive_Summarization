the statement from the club said : ' @entity1 can confirm the findings of an independent regulatory commission following statements made by chairman @entity0 in the @entity56 newspaper on november 20			1
@entity1 chairman @entity0 will not be allowed to attend his side 's next six matches the @entity77 are currently languishing in the @entity79 relegation zone , having won just four league games ' in summary , the @entity65 concluded that : ' we are satisfied on the evidence before us that mr @entity0 is not a racist			1
we are equally satisfied on the evidence before us that mr @entity0 did not intend to cause any offence by his comments			2
it is clear that he himself is very upset by the words he used and he moved very quickly to apologise publicly , plead guilty and begin to make amends '			0

what we called for was for him to withdraw his comments and apologise			0
' he did do that , and i am satisfied , as the @entity11 found , that mr @entity0 is not racist and had no racist intent , but the important thing in the battle against racism in general is that if someone makes a racist comment or action , the most important thing is the plain meaning of what they have done and the impact on the victims , not the intention of the person making it			2
' the @entity11 said @entity0 had breached @entity149 [ 1 ] in that comments made to the media were abusive and / or insulting and / or constituted improper conduct and / or brought the game into disrepute , and was an ' aggravated breach ' as it included ' a reference to ethnic origin and / or race and / or nationality and / or religion or belief '			1
