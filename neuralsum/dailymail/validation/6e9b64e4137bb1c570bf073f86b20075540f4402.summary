@entity0 is willing to give up his @entity2 contract to play county cricket in an attempt to make an extraordinary return to the @entity7 side			1
in what would be the first step of a very long journey back to international cricket , the exiled star is ready to accept the challenge of new @entity15 chairman @entity14 and try to fight his way back to the @entity7 side			1
@entity14 had said in a @entity18 interview last month that @entity0 would have to be playing regular county cricket if he was to have any chance of being considered by the a regime which is making sweeping changes at the @entity15			2
@entity0 is willing to turn his back on the @entity2 in order to represent @entity7 @entity0 , pictured in 2008 , would have to repair his relationship with @entity7 boss @entity26 the governing body were then quick to emphasise that nothing had changed in their stance and they would only pick those who were not only performing well in county cricket but who were ‘ a positive influence on the @entity7 side			1
’ @entity0 was picked up relatively cheaply by the @entity33 of the @entity2 this year in a deal worth around £ 200,000 making it less expensive for him to throw in his lot with an as yet unnamed county and try to call @entity14 bluff			0
yet a comeback , approaching 35 , would still be remarkable			0
@entity7 ’s need is greatest in one - day cricket , the format of the game @entity0 least enjoyed during his later years with @entity7 , and the wounds from his bitter sacking from @entity7 are still raw			0
he reopened many with his bitter book			0
if he came back it would be hard to see how he could work with senior players like @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 as well as coach @entity26 , who he tried to force out in 2009 , managing director @entity53 , who sacked him last year , and national selector @entity54 , who said in december that @entity0 would never play for @entity7 again			2
for @entity0 to come back now a lot of people would have to either depart or rebuild some seriously broken bridges			0
@entity0 's @entity7 future lies in the hands of new @entity15 chairman @entity14			1

@entity0 is keen to make a return to the @entity7 set up
the *34* - year - old will have to *convince* new @entity15 chairman @entity14
@entity0 has a frosty relationship with @entity7 boss @entity26
