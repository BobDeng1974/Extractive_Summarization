a media investigation into the allegations of rape featured in @entity4 's recently - released memoir has refuted the claims of sexual assault made by the @entity8 creator			1
the writer , actor and director dedicates a chapter of her book , @entity14 - for which she received a reported $ 3.7 million advance - to a boy she met at @entity16 in @entity17 identified as ' @entity18 ' , who she alleges raped her one night after a party			1
the 28 - year - old admits in the tome to drinking alcohol and taking @entity24 and cocaine before inviting @entity18 back to her on - campus apartment , but says the encounter quickly turned aggressive , and that @entity18 twice removed the condom during intercourse without telling her			1
' i never gave permission to be rough , to stick himself inside me without a barrier between us , ' she wrote			0
a new media investigation claims there is no proof of the man she describes ' i never gave him permission			1
' in my deepest self i know this , and the knowledge of it has kept me from sinking			0
' @entity4 's description of @entity18 is similarly explicit , explaining him as a ' mustachioed campus @entity58 ' with a ' mustache that rode the line between ironic @entity62 fashion and big buck hunter ' , who hosted a radio show called real talk with @entity67 , worked in the library stacking shelves and ' wore purple cowboy boots '			1
she also said that he once punched a girl ' in the boob ' at a party and , following a consensual sexual encounter , another girl woke to find blood spattered all over the wall ' like a crime scene '			0
furthermore @entity4 does not state that ' @entity18 ' is a pseudonym , as she does with other names that appear in her book			1
an investigation by @entity84 from @entity85 undertaken at the @entity16 campus , which was published thursday , concluded that the ' @entity87 describes is a ' ghost ' , and that no such person appeared to exist at the college during the years she studied there			1
' in fact , we could not find anyone who remembered any @entity16 @entity58 who matched @entity4 's colorful description , ' @entity84 wrote			1
' under scrutiny , @entity4 's rape story did n’t just fall apart , it evaporated into pixie dust and blew away			2
' scene : it is believed the rape @entity4 describes in her book took place at @entity16 in @entity17 ( pictured ) in the winter of 2005 following a party the @entity107 report followed an attack on @entity4 by @entity110 's hard - right columnist @entity109 , who said she was ' grossly irresponsible ' for publishing the rape claim in the first place			1
@entity109 said he spoke to a @entity18 who was a prominent @entity58 that attended @entity16 and that has been hounded by the media since the release of @entity14 in september			1
this @entity18 told @entity109 he has never met @entity4 and did not have any kind of relationship with her			1
he said the fact his name is @entity18 and that he is a @entity58 who went to @entity16 is ' the ' most unfortunate coincidence of my life '			1
the man , who is married with kids , said he is petrified that his full name is going to be published			0
@entity109 then wrote of @entity4 : ' it is at the very least the deployment of weaponized celebrity without any concern for collateral damage			2
' i have my doubts about whether the encounter @entity4 describes actually happened at all ; in her memoir , she writes about presenting anecdotes from other people ’s lives as her own			1
' but , for the record , the man to whom i spoke does not believe that @entity4 intended to refer to him			1
' the @entity107 investigation , which describes @entity4 as ' one of the most powerful and influential women in @entity142 ' , included the account of @entity109 's ' @entity18 '			1
it notes that friends of his laughed at the suggestion of him ever having a moustache and that other details given by @entity4 also did n't fit			2
@entity84 then goes in search of someone else that might fit the description			0
he deduces the alleged rape occurred in winter 2005			0
a search of the campus newspaper archives and @entity16 graduation announcements did not find any @entity18 - other than the one @entity109 spoke to - who graduated or attended @entity16 in 2005 , 2006 , or 2007			1
massive publicity tour : @entity4 meets fans and signs copies of her book ' @entity14 ' at @entity162 in @entity163 on october 29 , 2014 a further search of the campus for someone not named @entity18 but who fits the description given by @entity4 also showed no results			1
there was no proof of a radio show called @entity173 with @entity67 , he said			0
' nevertheless , no amount of digging could verify even a single detail of @entity4 's rape claim , ' @entity84 wrote			2
the report criticizes @entity4 for pointing the finger at this one @entity18 in such a public manner , as opposed to reporting what happened to her to the authorities			1
@entity4 has not responded to the @entity184 piece			2
calls to @entity186 , the publisher of @entity14 , and to @entity4 's literary agent made by @entity189 were not immediately returned on thursday			1
@entity4 did however react to @entity109 when his piece was published last month			2
she took to @entity191 to defend her story			0
love : @entity4 is seen here at the @entity193 with her boyfriend , musician @entity194 ' some men are enraged by stories of sexual assault that do n't have clear cut villains , pimps or men with guns , ' she wrote			2
' that 's because these stories force them to ask hard questions about their history with consent			0
' well , we all have to ask hard questions			0
grow the f --- up			0
' and i have some news for certain ' news ' outlets			0
no matter how much you thump your keyboards with your meat hands we will not stop talking			0
' this is not the only controversy to come from @entity4 's tome			2
the @entity42 native cancelled several appearances on her book tour after being accused of molesting her younger sister as a child			2
in one chapter of the book she describes how , as a seven - year - old , she experimented with her sister @entity229 , who was one at the time			2
' one day , as i sat in our driveway in @entity234 playing blocks and buckets , my curiosity got the better of me , ' @entity4 wrote			0
' @entity229 was sitting up , babbling smiling , and i leaned down between her legs and carefully spread open her vagina			0
' the accusations were mostly spearheaded by @entity109 , who said her behavior was child abuse			0
@entity4 came back swinging , writing on @entity191 : ' the right wing news story that i molested my little sister is n’t just @entity246 - it ’s really f --- ing upsetting and disgusting			0
family : @entity4 was accused of molesting her younger sister @entity229 ( pictured ) by two media outlets following a controversial chapter in her book , where she admits to experiment with her sibling as a child ' and by the way , if you were a little kid and never looked at another little kid ’s vagina , well , congrats to you			1
' usually this is stuff i can ignore but do n’t demean sufferers , do n’t twist my words , ' i told a story about being a weird 7 year old			0
i bet you have some too , old men , that i ’d rather not hear			0
' and yes , this is a rage spiral			0
