archaeologists have been left stumped after the remains of a @entity2 were found buried among human skeletons in a churchyard near @entity7 's @entity6 train station			1
the nine bones of the four - metre long animal were found inside a coffin with eight other sets of human remains , including three skulls , dating back to around 1822			1
researchers from @entity16 and @entity17 initially made the discovery in 2003 but following detailed studies of the bones , as well as searching through zoological records , the team has not found any conclusive proof as to how the animal arrived in the @entity24			2
the @entity26 walrus , pictured , is often hunted for its ivory tusks and one theory suggests the @entity6 animal may have been brought to the @entity24 for trade archaeologists have been left stumped after the remains of a @entity26 walrus was found buried among human skeletons in a churchyard near @entity7 's @entity6 train station			1
the remains of the animal , pictured , were found inside a coffin with eight other sets of human remains , including three skulls , dating back to around 1822 according to @entity45 's book @entity6 burial ground : excavations for @entity42 , the @entity7 terminus of @entity43 1 , 2002 – 3 , the churchyard was extended several times during the post-medieval period			1
this created the ' @entity48 ’ in 1792 and the last burial took place in 1854			0
@entity45 's study concentrated on the ‘ @entity52 ’ , where 1383 burials were thought to have taken place			0
he told the @entity54 that a rise in cholera , typhus and small pox at the time led to the high rate of burials			0
analysis included reconstruction of coffin stack sequences within known burial rows , illustrated in @entity66			0
a sample of 715 burials underwent ' full osteological analysis , revealing a heterogeneous population buried during a time of rapid urbanisation and industrialisation			0
' well - preserved human bones and coffins were found and many of the coffin plates were inscribed with biographical detail			1
refugees from the @entity80 as well as three aristocrats were among the discovery , alongside the remains of a @entity26 walrus and a dissected tortoise			1
they believe all the bones inside the mysterious coffin may have been used for medical science by one of the 40 anatomy schools in @entity7 open during the @entity91			1
the burial ground was discovered during excavations of the station when the @entity96 terminal moved from @entity97 to @entity6 in 2003			2
the research team was lead by archaeologist @entity45 and was funded by @entity43 1			0
the walrus bones , as well as the human remains discovered in the coffin , all showed signs of being cut up and dissected for medical research			1
many of the remains showed cuts and scrapes consistent with dissection , which was legalised by the @entity110 , and at least one of the human skulls discovered showed signs of ' cranial autopsy ' - drilling into the brain			2
@entity45 , along with @entity116 from the @entity117 , studied the bones and looked at @entity120 records for any clues as to how the bones arrived on the site			0
in their book , @entity6 burial ground : excavations for @entity42 , the @entity7 terminus of @entity43 1 , 2002 – 3 , @entity45 and @entity116 said : ' the animal bone consisted of a small , moderately - preserved group of eight bones derived from a walrus of a very large size and robust build			1
' the sample includes bones from a lower fore - limb , a fore - foot , first and second metacarpal , the lower hind limbs , fibula , calcaneum , astragalus and first cuneiform			2
these bones are significantly larger than their reference equivalents held at the @entity144			0
' microscopic examination revealed that all the @entity6 walrus bones show some degree of surface erosion and butchery marks			1
three clear superficial transverse knife cuts were noted			0
' mr @entity45 told @entity54 : ' the way that the walrus bones were found among the skeletal remains suggests they would have been used as a teaching collection from a research institution			1
these remains are the @entity2 ' back right leg and ankle			0
the walrus bones , as well as the human remains discovered in the coffin , all showed signs of being cut up and dissected for medical research including knife cuts a human skull discovered with the walrus bones , pictured , showed signs of cranial autopsy - drilling into the brain ' historical accounts of animal dissections show that in 1853 , professor @entity173 from the @entity120 carried out medical research on a walrus			1
' this could have been the walrus found buried in @entity6 , yet mr @entity45 and his team have not been able to categorically confirm this to be the case			1
he believes the coffin with the walrus bones dates between 1822 and 1854 because it was found in a horizontal burial trench			1
up until november 1822 , burials were carried out on a plot - by - plot basis before the trench method was introduced			0
mr @entity45 added that this was also the year when the old @entity6 church lost its status and the new @entity6 church was used in its place - this would have created an upheaval of bones and burials			2
walruses are hunted and killed for their skin and ivory tusks and the animal found beneath @entity42 may have also been brought to the @entity24 for trade			2
the remains of the @entity6 walrus are on display at the @entity203 and @entity204 in @entity205 , @entity7			2
all the human remains have been reburied			0
father @entity207 is currently seeking funding for repairs to the @entity210 on the site of the dig. based on the remains , pictured , the walrus is believed to have been around four metres long			0
this was quoted by @entity45 as ' significantly larger than their reference equivalents held at the @entity218			0
' the remains are on display at @entity203 and @entity204 in @entity205 , @entity7			0
