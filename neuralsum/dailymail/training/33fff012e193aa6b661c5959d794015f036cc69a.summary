by @entity0 for decades children – and adults – have cowered behind a cushion when the shape - shifting t - 1000 robot assassin hunted @entity5 in the hit movie @entity6			1
but the terrifying technology is closer to becoming a reality now that scientists have created a sophisticated form - changing material			1
that could allow robots to switch between hard and soft shapes			0
the material , that could lead to a new generation of droids , is able to morph into different states thanks to its precise mixture of wax and foam			1
the material in on the left , is cool so its wax coating is rigid , while the one on the right does not have a wax coating and collapses under weight			1
by heating a wax coating , it could be as flexible , and could regain its rigid form again with cooling wax coating , while the one on the right is uncoated and remains compliant ( here , it collapses under a wrench ) to build a material capable of shifting between squishy and rigid states , the researchers coated a foam structure in wax			1
they chose foam because it can be squeezed into a small fraction of its normal size , but once released will bounce back to its original shape			2
the wax coating , meanwhile , can change from a hard outer shell to a soft , pliable surface with moderate heating			0
this could be done by running a wire along each of the coated foam struts and then applying a current to heat up and melt the surrounding wax			0
turning off the current again would allow the material to cool down and return to its rigid state			2
in addition to switching the material to its soft state , heating the wax in this way would also repair any damage sustained			2
in the 1991 film , @entity6 , the shape - shifting @entity73 robotic @entity72 agent was made of liquid metal , allowing him to morph into a fluid state and squeeze through tight spaces as well as repairing himself when injured			1
it is hoped that the new material , which was developed by @entity79 , a professor of mechanical engineering and applied mathematics at the @entity82 , ( @entity82 ) could give real robots similar capabilities at a low cost			1
their material could be used to build deformable surgical robots , which would move through the body to reach a particular point without damaging any of the organs or vessels along the way			1
robots built from the material , described in a new paper in the journal @entity98 , could also be used in search - and - rescue operations to squeeze through rubble looking for survivors , professor @entity79 explained			1
in the 1991 film , @entity6 , the shape - shifting @entity73 robotic @entity72 agent ( pictured ) was made of liquid metal , allowing him to morph into a fluid state and squeeze through tight spaces as well as repairing himself when injured			1
the new material could facilitate shape - shifting powers in the future to build a material capable of shifting between squishy and rigid states , the researchers coated a foam lattice structure in wax			1
they chose foam because it can be squeezed into a small fraction of its normal size , but once released , will bounce back to its original shape			0
the wax coating , meanwhile , can change from a hard outer shell to a soft , pliable surface with moderate heating			0
professor @entity79 said that this could be done by running a wire along each of the coated foam ‘ struts , ’ before applying a current to heat up and melt the surrounding wax			0
turning off the current again would allow the material to cool down and return to its rigid state			2
in addition to switching the material to its soft state , heating the wax in this way would also repair any damage sustained , she said			2
‘ this material is self - healing			1
so if you push it too far and fracture the coating , you can heat it and then cool it , and the structure returns to its original configuration , ’ professor @entity79 explained			0
here , the 3d - printed soft , flexible scaffold that is coated in wax , is being compressed in a temperature - controlled chamber			0
heating a composite where the wax coating has broken can enable the wax to soften and ' heal ' to restore its original strength and properties to build the material , the researchers simply placed the polyurethane foam in a bath of melted wax			1
they then squeezed the foam to encourage it to soak up the wax , said co-author of the study @entity159			0
‘ a lot of materials innovation can be very expensive , but in this case you could just buy really low - cost polyurethane foam and some wax from a craft store , ’ she said			2
the wax coating could be replaced by a stronger material , such as solder			0
working with robotics experts , the researchers began looking at ‘ squishy robots , ’ which are capable of squeezing through tight spaces and then expanding again , much like octopuses do			0
but useful robots need to exert a reasonable amount of force on their surroundings in order to be useful			0
professor @entity79 said : ‘ you ca n't just create a bowl of @entity182 , because if the @entity182 has to manipulate an object , it would simply deform without applying significant pressure to the thing it was trying to move			0
’ ‘ if you 're trying to squeeze under a door , for example , you should opt for a soft state , but if you want to pick up a hammer or open a window , you need at least part of the machine to be rigid			0

scientists from the @entity82 created the shape - shifting material from wax and foam
it *'s* hoped the material will lead to robots being able to change from a rigid to liquid - like state , as *demonstrated* in the film @entity6
it is self - healing , like the *villainous* t - 1000 robot in the film
material could be used to build deformable surgical robots , which would move through the body with ease to reach a particular point
it could also be used in search and rescue situations in the future
