by @entity1 reporter published : 11:08 est , 13 august 2012 updated : 15:58 est , 13 august 2012 @entity2 has come under fire yet again for its @entity5 programming - this time for editing out highly - anticipated rock acts from its coverage of the extravagant closing ceremony on sunday night			1
hundreds of enraged viewers across the @entity11 vented their frustration on @entity13 after the network cut out performances by @entity16 , @entity17 for an hour - long preview of @entity19			1
this selective editing meant @entity2 's coverage ended as it began , after the network chose to cut out a moving tribute to the victims of the 2005 @entity26 bombings from the @entity27			1
interrupted : @entity28 and @entity29 of @entity30 perform during the @entity31			0
their performance was delayed until after @entity2 showed an hour - long preview of a new show cut : @entity36 of @entity37 plays at the ceremony on sunday			1
the band 's performance was cut for @entity11 viewers even though it made the official song for the @entity5 ' i still do n't understand , it 's a tape delay , so ca n't you do the math in advance ? why do you need to cut off the closing ceremony ? # nbcfail , ' @entity48 complained on @entity13			1
actor @entity51 added : ' why # nbcfail ranks last : no better way to turn people off a new show than to preempt @ thewho & other rock legends for it			0
' viewers were astounded when the network instead showed a preview of its new comedy , @entity19 episode			0
some acts were cut entirely , but the who 's performance was shown an hour later			2
music fans were left disappointed by the absence of @entity37 , who performed their official @entity5 song , @entity70 , while backed by a massive choir			1
ousted : a performance by musician @entity16 was also cut from the @entity2 broadcast dazzling : @entity30 plays for thousands of fans at the @entity31 - but millions more in the @entity11 had to wait to watch the performance			2
it is just the latest in a string of gaffes by @entity2 during the @entity5 twitter user @entity79 pointed out : ' do they not know that @entity37 did the @entity81 ? @entity82			1
' ' their broadcast was horrible ! no muse with the official song of the @entity5			2
who made that call ? @ @entity2 # @entity92 , ' user @entity88 wrote			0
@entity2 , which streamed the ceremony live on its @entity5 website , had urged viewers on its @entity13 page to stay tuned for ' the who after @entity97 : ) '			1
it concluded with : ' and that 's a wrap ! thanks for enjoying the 2012 # @entity5 with us ! ' the network came under repeated fire throughout the 16 days of the @entity103 for a string of gaffes			2
outrage : viewers lambasted @entity2 on @entity13 for cutting out the highly - anticipated musical acts it started off on the wrong foot by editing out a tribute for the victims of the 2005 @entity26 bombings from the @entity27 coverage , deeming it ' not suited for @entity11 audiences '			1
@entity13 was also flooded with gripes about @entity2 keeping marquee events off the air until prime - time , the broadcast that brings in the most viewers and advertising revenue for the network			1
sports fans were particularly enraged when the 100m men 's sprint - won by @entity126 runner @entity125 - was delayed by nearly six hours for @entity11 audiences			0
and although @entity2 had defended its choice by telling viewers they could watch it streaming live on the internet , the page failed to load correctly , leaving thousands fuming			0
' @entity125 outruns the @entity2 live stream 's buffer ! ' one @entity13 user joked			2
poor choice : instead , @entity2 chose to air an hour - long preview of its new show , @entity19 offensive : @entity2 also came under fire for showing an advert of a monkey competing in gymnastics shortly , pictured , after @entity144 @entity143 won the gold medal @entity2 was also forced to apologise after airing an ad featuring a monkey performing gymnastics , right after showing the performance of @entity143 , the first @entity144 to win @entity5 gold			2
in another instance , it spoiled the results of @entity11 swimmer @entity155 's gold medal - winning race when it ran an advert for the today show revealing the outcome before it was telecast that night			0
and it came under fire for filing a complaint over tweets by @entity163 journalist @entity162 , whose @entity13 account was suspended after he lambasted the network 's coverage			1
@entity167 , the @entity5 executive producer who is overseeing the coverage , repeatedly stood by the delayed viewing , saying the prime time viewers take priority - especially when the network , which paid $ 1.2 billion to acquire the @entity5 rights , was desperately trying to avoid a loss			2
' when a company invests the kind of money that we have in the @entity5 we have absolutely every right to protect that investment , ' he said in a previous interview with @entity183			0
frustrating : sports fans were also annoyed when @entity2 delayed @entity125 's 100m win by nearly six hours bad start : @entity2 edited out a tribute to the victims of the 2005 bomb attacks in @entity26 in the @entity27 shock : viewers flocked to @entity13 to vent their anger - but @entity167 said the cut was down to time constraints ' there 's still a huge audience out there of people who want to watch this stuff at a time when it is convenient for them , when there are mass audiences , when people can gather around and watch tv , and one of the last great family viewing events out there			1
' this is one thing you watch together			0
and if you kind of end up giving it away on tv you 're not protecting your investment and you 're not serving the audience and you 're not serving the affiliates and you 're not serving the advertisers			0
' despite audiences frustrations , the @entity219 were the second most watched event in @entity11 tv history , early nielsen ratings have shown			0
in total , 210.5 million people tuned in to the @entity5 on the first 14 days , across @entity225 â€™s networks that include @entity2 , @entity226 , @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity229 and @entity230			0
the 2012 viewership surpassed the audience of 209 million who watched the @entity235 but lagged behind the 215 million @entity11 viewers for the @entity237 .			0

@entity2 edited out highly - anticipated music acts from ceremony on sunday
cut performance by @entity37 - even though it made official @entity5 song
enraged viewers took to @entity13 to lambast the network
just the latest in a string of gaffes that have *plagued* @entity2 's coverage
