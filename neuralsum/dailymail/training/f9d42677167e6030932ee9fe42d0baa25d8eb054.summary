@entity1 is set to reveal a completely new version of its @entity4 eyewear next year , it has been revealed			1
the troubled product has failed to fire the public 's imagination , with wearers dubbed ' glassholes ' and even many @entity1 employees abandoning them			1
however , an new version with chips made by @entity13 will go on sale next year			1
recently it emerged that the consumer version , which @entity1 promised would go on sale this year , has now been delayed until 2015 - raising questions over its future			1
the @entity36 , who heads up the top - secret lab which developed @entity4 , has hardly given up on the product - he recently wore his pair to the beach			1
but @entity44 's timing is not propitious , coming as many developers and early @entity4 users are losing interest in the much - hyped , $ 1,500 test version of the product : a camera , processor and stamp - sized computer screen mounted to the edge of eyeglass frames			1
where 's the @entity4 ? @entity44 was spotted without @entity1 's specs at a @entity57 red - carpet event on sunday			1
since they were unveiled , he has rarely been seen without them			1
@entity1 itself has pushed back the @entity4 roll out to the mass market			1
while @entity4 may find some specialized , even lucrative , uses in the workplace , its prospects of becoming a consumer hit in the near future are slim , many developers say			1
of 16 @entity4 app makers contacted by @entity68 , nine said that they had stopped work on their projects or abandoned them , mostly because of the lack of customers or limitations of the device			1
three more have switched to developing for business , leaving behind consumer projects			2
however , plenty of larger developers remain with @entity4			2
the nearly 100 apps on the official web site include @entity82 and @entity83 , although one major player recently defected : @entity85			2
@entity1 founder @entity44 ( @entity86 ) and designer @entity87 sit and watch the rehearsal for her @entity90 collection show during @entity91 , where new @entity4 frameswere launched in a bid to make them more appealing			1
@entity4 was the first project to emerge from @entity1 's x division , the secretive group tasked with developing ' moonshot'products such as self - driving cars			2
glass and wearable devices overall amount to a new technology , as smartphones once were , that will likely take time to evolve into a product that clickswith consumers			1
' if there was 200 million @entity4 sold , it would be a different perspective , ' said @entity111 , the chief executive of @entity113 , which put development of a @entity4 game on hold this year and is looking at other platforms , including the @entity82 - owned virtual - reality goggles @entity120			2
' there 's no market at this point , ' several key @entity1 employees instrumental to developing @entity4 have left the company in the last six months , including lead developer @entity126 , electrical engineering chief @entity127 , and @entity128 , director of developer relations			1
and a glass funding consortium created by @entity132 and two of @entity57 's biggest venture capitalists , @entity129 and @entity130 , quietly deleted its website , routing users to the main @entity16 site			1
@entity1 insists it is committed to @entity4 , with hundreds of engineers and executives working on it , as well as new fashionista boss @entity141 , a former @entity142 executive			2
' we are completely energized and as energized as ever about the opportunity that wearables and @entity4 in particular represent , ' said @entity146 of business operations @entity147			2
' we are as committed as ever to a consumer launch			2
' that is going to take time and we are not going to launch this product until it 's absolutely ready , ' @entity147 said			2
after an initial burst of enthusiasm , signs that consumers are giving up on @entity4 have been @entity157 developers recently have felt unsupported by investorsand , at times , @entity1 itself			2
@entity44 had predicted a launch this year , but 2015 is now the most likely date , a person familiar with the matter said			1
after an initial burst of enthusiasm , signs that consumers are giving up on @entity4 have been building			0
some developers recently have felt unsupported by investors and , at times , @entity1 itself			0
the @entity174 , the funding consortium co-run by @entity132 , invested in only three or four small start - ups by the beginning of this year , a person familiar with the statistics said			0
a @entity132 spokeswoman declined to comment on the number of investments and said the web site was closed for simplicity			0
' we just found it 's easier for entrepreneurs to come to us directly , ' she said			0
the lack of a launch date has given some developers the impression that @entity1 still treats @entity4 as an experiment			0
@entity1 dubbed the first set of several thousand @entity16 users as ' explorers			1
' but as the @entity192 hit the streets , they drew stares and jokes			0
some people viewed the device , capable of surreptitious video recording , as an obnoxious privacy intrusion , deriding the once - proud explorers as ' @entity202			0
' ' it looks super nerdy , ' said @entity204 , a @entity205 - based consultant , whose @entity4 now gathers dust in a drawer			0
' i 'm a card carrying nerd , but this was one card too many			0
' @entity4 now sells on @entity212 for as little as half list price			1
' it 's not a big enough platform to play on seriously , ' said @entity216 , founder of @entity218 - based software firm @entity217 , which put on hold a @entity4 app for logging exercise and biking			0
mobile game company @entity222 , known for its popular ' @entity223 : @entity225 ' title , was one of the first to launch a game on @entity4			0
@entity230 , a puzzler released a year ago , is still available , but @entity222 has discontinued work on it , a spokesman for the company said			0
another developer , @entity234 , won $ 10,000 in a contest last year for creating an aliens - themed video game for @entity4 , @entity238 , but @entity1 never put it on the official hub for glass apps , making it tougher to find			1
he has quit working on updates			0
still , there are some enthusiastic developers			0
cycling and running app @entity246 finds @entity4 well - suited for its users , who want real - time data on their workouts , said @entity252 , vice president of business development			0
and entrepreneur @entity253 said it is ideal for his company , @entity255 , which detects if people are falling asleep at the wheel			0
in april , @entity1 launched the @entity259 program to help make the device useful for specific industries , such as healthcare and manufacturing			0
so far the effort has resulted in apps that are being tested or used at companies such as @entity267 and @entity269 ' @entity268			0
@entity1 is selling @entity4 in bulk to some businesses , offering two - for - one discounts .			0
