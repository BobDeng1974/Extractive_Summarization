a @entity1 ' toy nerd ' has spent the equivalent of hundreds of thousands of pounds and even lost girlfriends to a highly unusual hobby : collecting dolls			1
@entity6 has decorated the living room of his otherwise rather spartan townhouse a vivid pink ( @entity12 's signature colour @entity10 , naturally ) in order to do justice to his collection of dolls , including 6,000 barbies			1
in a floor - to - ceiling glass case in the living room , @entity17 shares a drink with @entity21 as @entity22 , the evil sorceress from ' @entity24 ' , @entity25 and @entity26 look on			1
elsewhere are @entity27 , @entity28 as @entity29 and characters from ' @entity31 ' and ' @entity32			0
' @entity6 poses with part of his collection , which has taken him 20 years to amass , at his home in @entity1 @entity6 's passion runs the gamut of eras and styles ; here he shows off a @entity17 doll the 6000 @entity12 are just a portion of his doll collection , which is steadily taking over his townhouse @entity6 now has a professional interest in toys and consumer trends as director of strategy at @entity49 the 33 - year - old allows his prized barbies and 3,000 dolls of other kinds to dominate three sides of the main room and spill over to fill nine mirrored cabinets in his dressing room and the shelves of his study			1
he said : ' incongruous is kind of me			0
when you meet me outside of this , i 'm not that kind of guy			0
i 'm not what you expect from a guy that collects dolls			0
' although @entity6 now has a professional interest in toys and consumer trends in his job as director of strategy at @entity49 , his @entity12 collection began at age 13 when he bought the ' @entity79 ' model in a turquoise @entity81 gym outfit and striped leg warmers			1
' before i knew anything about social norms , i was a boy that watched this on tv , liked it and was n't allowed to have one , ' he said			0
' as i grew older , got my own allowance , that 's where i started getting the freedom to buy whatever i wanted			0
' his boyhood interest turned into a ' crazy obsession ' that his friends support and his family has come to accept			2
@entity6 buys dolls when he travels for work and purchased 65 dolls during his last trip to @entity104 rare @entity12 dolls in the likeness of @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109 ( @entity110 ) are displayed @entity6 talks about the very first doll he brought ; the ' @entity79 ' model in a turquoise @entity81 gym outfit and striped leg warmers @entity6 slings an accessory over the first doll that started off his collection ' i 'm very into collections , i 'm very into amassing , ' @entity6 said			1
' i 've also got the ex-girlfriends who get insecure about this kind of stuff ... they look at dolls and go ' ok , that 's the competition ' , which is quite troubling but it 's a reality			2
' the self - described ' toy nerd ' reckons he has spent at least s $ 500,000 ( £ 251,669 ) over the last 20 years on his collection , which also features hundreds and hundreds of dolls from the @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 and the @entity135 lines			1
@entity12 , launched in 1959 by @entity136 wearing a zebra - pattern swimsuit , has sold more than 1 billion dolls sales of the dolls and related products did fall 12 percent in the april to june period of this year - the fourth straight quarter of decline - as tastes shift away from the traditional toy , but @entity6 maintains that @entity12 is an icon that still has a future , although he admits ' the relevance is waning ' as princesses and ballerinas give way to the ghoulish imagery and stories popularised by vampire movies such as ' @entity154 ' and ' @entity155 '			1
a @entity157 doll sits among other dolls : @entity6 says despite the size of his collection he has no plans to stop ' that 's where @entity136 has taken it , ' he said			1
' they have taken the craze of ugly is hot and made @entity132 because they know @entity12 will never be the monster			0
' @entity167 , @entity136 's main competitor and a client of @entity6 's in his work , has made similar changes to its dolls			2
@entity6 's oldest barbies date from the early 1960s , including one in a nurse 's outfit with cat 's eye glasses			0
but his passion runs the gamut of eras and styles , including barbies in dozens of national costumes and editions with the likenesses of @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity107			1
the rarest @entity12 he owns is a model sold only in boutiques of the @entity190 fashion label			2
' my friend found her in @entity194 and made an emergency phone call to me , ' he said			0
@entity6 admits that some girlfriends have felt threatened by his collection , seeing the dolls as the ' competition ' the dolls now spill over from the living room to fill nine mirrored cabinets in his dressing room and the shelves of his study @entity6 's collection also features hundreds and hundreds of dolls from the @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 and the @entity135 lines ' i travel for work , i travel for myself , so i find dolls everywhere , ' @entity6 said			1
on his last trip to @entity104 , he bought 65 dolls			0
he is going there again this month and is sure to hit the shops			0
@entity6 also get dolls as gifts and buys them at auction and online			2
he has no plans to slow down , so what will he do when he runs out of space ? ' i 'll buy the other house , ' he laughed , pointing next door .			0
