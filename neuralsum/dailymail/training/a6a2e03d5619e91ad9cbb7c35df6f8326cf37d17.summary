a chemical used in foam cups and disposable food containers may cause cancer , scientists have warned			1
styrene can be ' reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen ' , the @entity5 in the @entity6 said yesterday			1
the conclusion was reached by a team of 10 experts in toxicology , chemistry and medicine			1
@entity7 - the chemical used in foam cups and disposable food containers - can be ' reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen ' , the @entity5 in the @entity6 said yesterday ' [ however ] ' i think it 's important to keep in mind that this is a hazard assessment , ' dr @entity16 , who chaired the research council 's committee of experts , told @entity24			1
the declaration means there is ' scientific evidence suggesting that styrene causes cancer , but there may be alternative explanations , such as chance , bias or confounding factors ' , explained dr @entity16 , who led the @entity36 during the @entity38 era			0
' our report says this chemical could be a problem , but a full risk - assessment on dose , exposure , quantification and further characterization of the risk would need to be done before one would think about regulation in this area , ' she added			0
dr @entity16 also stressed that the term ' reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen ' , was far from emphatic - unlike , say , factors such as tobacco			1
and that the @entity5 's latest ruling was in the line of that three years ago , when concerns were raised about the possible links between styrene and cancer			0
but industry experts say regulatory agencies have deemed polystyrene safe for use in contact with food and drink the @entity5 is a major policy body and division of the @entity71 , which includes the @entity72 , the @entity73 and the @entity74			1
the @entity75 has previously defended styrene , saying : ' polystyrene plastic has been used in foodservice products - foam coffee cups , salad bar takeout containers , cutlery - for more than five decades			2
' polystyrene has been reviewed by regulatory agencies that have deemed it safe for use in contact with food			0
' for example , polystyrene meets the stringent standards of the @entity36 and the @entity89 / @entity88 for use in packaging to store and serve food			2
' earlier this month @entity94 scientists warned that more than 170 dangerous chemicals - including styrene - are legally used in the production of food packaging			2
the @entity99 warned the toxic substances , which were found to cause cancer and inflict changes on genes , could end up in the food they contain			0
but the @entity106 moved to reassure consumers , explaining all food packaging falls within @entity110 standards and the presence of the chemicals are of no concern if they are used within the ' limits or restrictions ' set for their use			2
the study , published in the journal @entity120 , discovered around 175 chemicals with varying affects			0
they found the substances interfered with sperm production , caused genital malformations and disrupted hormone production in the body .			0

styrene can be ' reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen '
conclusion reached by 10 leading medical experts in the @entity6
they stress further research is needed before chemical is regulated
@entity75 says styrene has passed most stringent safety tests to be used in food and drink packaging
