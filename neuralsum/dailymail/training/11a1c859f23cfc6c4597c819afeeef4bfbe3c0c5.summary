this is the place where the @entity1 exchanged nods with a complete stranger who was sitting in a warm bath			1
it was where princess @entity6 allegedly took cocaine with the @entity9 at a concert , and where a young @entity11 had announced he had found @entity12 at a @entity14 ‘ crusade ’			1
oh yes , and in 1896 @entity15 put on his @entity16 there			1
but now the bulldozers are growling with impatience			1
soon the demolition men will be moving in			1
with an £ 8 billion project at stake — now that @entity23 mayor @entity22 has given the scheme his blessing — they will not take long to reduce to rubble the art deco façade famous around the world and the vast buildings on 77 valuable acres behind it			1
@entity33 , if that is the right word , comes in many guises			1
in this instance , @entity35 , for more than a century a palace of excitement and dreams in the heart of @entity23 , is coming down to make way for — but you already knew — town houses and flats			1
for generations of young lovers and families , @entity35 has resonated with our most fundamental needs — home - making , romance and entertainment			1
what brought the late queen mother into contact with a bathing man there was the @entity77 , which was staged at @entity35 over many years			1
it was the mid-eighties and she had declared the highly popular exhibition open			1
then , as she began a tour of the exhibits , she steered a course through the kitchens towards the bathrooms — and there was this young man demonstrating one of the luxuries of life			1
their brief exchange was not exactly a deep conversation , more an exchange of smiles and nods			1
the poor chap was in no position to bow			1
he was said to be ‘ almost in a prayer ’ of relief when she moved on			2
the waiting cameramen resisted the temptation to capture the introduction , but demonstrating wise discretion , they instead photographed a subsequent encounter between the @entity1 and a female model wearing a swimsuit			2
princess @entity6 ( left ) allegedly took cocaine with the @entity9 at a concert at @entity46 after she was invited back stage by @entity112 ( right ) @entity113 perform at the @entity114 on december 11 - which could be one of the last events to be held at the famous venue as for princess @entity6 ’s visit backstage with the @entity9 , this emerged in a scurrilous biography of the @entity1 ’s sister in which it was alleged she was invited by @entity112 to a @entity9 concert at @entity35 and partook of the drug with them in their dressing rooms before the concert , watched by 23,000 people , had begun			1
‘ an amusing drug , do n’t you think ? ’ she was quoted as saying to one of the band ’s female assistants			2
for @entity11 , the exhibition centre holds very different memories			1
he was 26 and already a big star when he went to @entity35 to see @entity138 evangelist @entity14			2
he listened to @entity14 — now 95 and in poor health — and that night he joined dozens of others in the audience shuffling down to the front of the stage			2
suddenly there he was on stage declaring to 27,000 people he had found @entity12			2
@entity148 and @entity149 with the @entity151 models at the underwear chain 's fashion show , held at @entity46 earlier this month others have packed into the great auditorium for very different reasons			1
on july 16 , 1939 , just six weeks before the outbreak of @entity159 , @entity157 filled it to overflowing with his blackshirts for a mass rally of the @entity163			2
with the party ’s white lightning bolt insignia hanging from the walls , @entity157 ’s ranting speech raised to a fever of excitement the 50,000 who had squeezed standing into a space built to seat half that number			2
‘ @entity157 , @entity157 , @entity157 , ’ they cried until his name reverberated around the walls and could be heard outside in the streets			2
that @entity35 gathering was then , and remains now , the biggest indoor political rally ever held in @entity179			2
when @entity157 hired @entity181 , it was only two years old in its present form			2
back in 1887 , when it was originally opened on what had been waste land by the engineer - businessman @entity188 , it was an open - air space surrounded by covered stands , rather as football stadia are today			1
it was called @entity35 after the @entity192 , who owned the freehold			2
one of @entity188 ’s first major successes was @entity15 ’s @entity16 , which pulled in 15,000 visitors a day including , on one occasion , the whole of @entity199 , possibly including the young @entity200 who had just started there			1
the ground was turned into a lake in order to accommodate captain @entity206 ’s @entity205 , an aquatic stunts display featuring the country ’s first ‘ water toboggan ’			0
in 1895 there was the @entity211 supported by four maharajahs , with spectacular displays and a 300ft ferris wheel that could carry 1,600 people at a time , revolving in eight minutes ( though on one occasion when it broke down the passengers were suspended for four - and - a - half hours )			0
in a po - faced editorial , the magazine @entity219 described the wheel as ‘ a foolish kind of sensational toy			0
carrying coachloads of fools round in a vertical circle ’			0
then came @entity227 and @entity35 became a refugee camp for @entity229 whose country had been overrun by the @entity232 army			1
part of it became a bus depot			0
but when new owners took it over in 1935 , they decided to build a vast , triangular building over the site			1
@entity11 was 26 and already a big star when he went to @entity35 to see @entity138 evangelist @entity14			0
suddenly there he was on stage declaring to 27,000 people he had found @entity12 @entity35 was also where @entity245 @entity244 wore her famous @entity163 flag dress at the brit awards ironically , at the outbreak of war this huge edifice that @entity157 had hired to promote his black propaganda served the war effort brilliantly , and was perfect as a factory making and testing barrage balloons in the heart of @entity23 where they were most needed			0
the post-war years and the country ’s need for glamour and entertainment revealed @entity35 to be the most flexible venue in the country			1
in 1948 there was the @entity265 , starring @entity266 , who had gone from being an @entity268 swimming champion to @entity270 ’s @entity269			0
@entity35 was the perfect place for @entity269 , for it had been built with a permanent swimming pool covered by a 750 - ton concrete floor which slid in and out of sight at the touch of a button			0
the queen mother with @entity278 at the opening of the 1970 @entity51 they packed in to see @entity281 and other ice - borne shows			1
during one panto in 1949 , one of the skating clowns stopped to plant a kiss on the bald head of a mild - looking chap sitting with his family in the front row			0
it was @entity293 , @entity179 ’s post-war @entity294 prime minister			0
a strong royal link also began to take root as the @entity297 — the world ’s largest military tattoo , held by the @entity300 annually — was established there , along with the @entity302 and the @entity303			0
for @entity14 , it was a natural place to hold his mass meetings			0
and then @entity35 was discovered , as it were , by the pop groups			0
@entity307 first played there in 1973 , and had other full - capacity appearances in 1980 , and again in 1981 , selling out the entire 85,000 tickets in just four hours			0
thirteen years later , in 1994 , they had just started their set when a stand holding 1,200 fans collapsed , injuring 96			0
miraculously , no one was killed			0
@entity316 filled it for several nights in 1975 , charging £ 1 a ticket : £ 9 in today ’s money , and what fans might pay for a programme these days			1
the @entity9 , too , played @entity35 to packed houses , sometimes with @entity112 ’s friend @entity6 and friends slipping into their seats just as the lights went down			0
@entity35 was also where @entity245 @entity244 wore her famous @entity163 flag dress at @entity330 , and where , just the other week , the @entity332 extravaganza attracted huge attention			0
and , finally , it was in an almost surreal atmosphere that the @entity337 , an indie rock band from north @entity23 , took to the stage on saturday			0
for this , it seems , was the very last gig of any kind at @entity35			0
@entity307 ’s @entity342 made a point of being there			0
he slipped on stage to sing the band ’s song @entity345			0
with rock royalty on stage , someone described the farewell to @entity35 as ‘ joyous ’			0
nostalgic would surely have been a better word to describe the night the music died .			0
