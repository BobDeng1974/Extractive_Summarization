@entity0 has refused to take part in a public inquiry into the death of poisoned former @entity5 spy @entity4			1
the investigative committee of the @entity0 ( @entity7 ) , a law - enforcement agency which answers directly to president @entity9 , has told inquiry chairman sir @entity10 it will not be a ' core participant ' in the process			1
mr @entity4 , 43 , died in november 2006 after he was poisoned with polonium - 210 while drinking tea at a meeting , allegedly with two @entity0 - former @entity5 contacts @entity15 and @entity17 - at the @entity18 in @entity20 's @entity19			1
he died after drinking tea laced with polonium - 210 after allegedly meeting with contacts his family believes he was working for @entity27 at the time and was killed on the orders of the @entity30			0
former @entity5 bodyguard @entity15 and @entity17 have been identified as the prime suspects in the killing , but both deny any involvement and remain in @entity0			2
sir @entity10 formally opened the inquiry in july after mr @entity4 's widow @entity37 led a successful challenge against holding an inquest into his death			1
in a letter read to a directions hearing at the @entity43 , the @entity7 , sometimes dubbed the ' @entity0 @entity44 ' , said it would not take part as it did not agree with powers granted in public inquiries that allow evidence to be held in closed session			2
the letter from solicitors @entity52 and @entity54 on behalf of the authorities said : ' this is a decision that the @entity7 has reached after very careful consideration and with much regret			0
' however the @entity7 is not willing to participate in a process where it appears that a considerable amount of evidence will be heard in closed session			0
. ' they added the @entity7 intended ' no disrespect ' towards sir @entity10 or the proceedings			1
the inquiry will be authorised to examine claims of @entity0 responsibility for the incident which has been described as ' a miniature nuclear attack on the streets of @entity20 '			1
mrs @entity4 fought for the probe into her husband 's murder after sir @entity10 said he could not hold a ' fair and fearless ' investigation as part of an inquest , and a public inquiry should take place instead			1
@entity4 tirelessly fought for the probe into her husband 's murder , which resulted in the public inquiry being opened by sir @entity10 in july			1
the government previously resisted launching an inquiry the government had previously resisted launching an inquiry , instead saying it would ' wait and see ' what a judge - led inquest found , but the @entity88 ruled the home secretary should reconsider the decision			0
although mrs @entity4 and her lawyers will not be able to see secret material , the chairman can take it into account , unlike in an inquest			2
but it is unclear whether the right to broadcast the inquiry live will be granted by sir @entity10			1
@entity99 , @entity100 , who represents eleven media organisations at the inquiry including the @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 , said broadcasting the inquiry would give the public ' faith ' in the hearing			0
' the media 's only agenda is its sincere desire that the inquiry is as transparent and accessible as possible , ' he said			0
' the secretary of state says there is no good reason for broadcasting any part of this inquiry , even the opening and closing submissions ... also there is no good reason for broadcasting the evidence of witnesses			0
' we say as a bald assertion that is untenable			0
there is worldwide interest in this case , a man was murdered on the streets of @entity20 by radioactive poisoning			0
' mr @entity4 , 43 , died after being poisoned while drinking tea at a meeting , allegedly with two @entity0 contacts - @entity15 and @entity17 - at the @entity18 in @entity20 's @entity19 ( pictured ) counsel for the inquiry , representatives from the @entity133 , and the @entity135 police oppose live coverage			1
@entity138 , @entity100 , for the @entity135 police said : ' the public interest is best served by a public inquiry which encourages witnesses to come forwards which encourages witnesses to assist and which encourages and permits witnesses to give evidence without unnecessary pressure , alarm , intimidation or strain			2
' it is the quality of the evidence which is paramount , not the broadcasting of it throughout the world			0
' mrs @entity4 attended today 's proceedings which also touched the topic of special advocates for closed sessions			0
sir @entity10 will announce his decisions on broadcasting and special advocates at a future date			2
the chairman said the substantive hearings would start on january 27 and an additional preparatory hearing would be held on october 16			0
sir @entity10 previously said that alleged @entity0 state responsibility in the 43 - year - old 's death was of ' central importance to my investigation '			1
however , @entity175 's responsibility for protecting the former @entity5 officer will not be investigated as part of the inquiry as there is no evidence to suggest any failings on the state 's part .			2

former @entity5 spy @entity4 was poisoned in @entity20 hotel in 2006
*coroner* sir @entity10 requested a public inquiry instead of an inquest
since july , investigators probing whether @entity0 state was behind murder
