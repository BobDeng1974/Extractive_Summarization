by @entity1 correspondent older women are putting themselves at risk by failing to attend smear tests it has been revealed			1
file image older women are putting their lives at risk by failing to go for regular smear tests , cancer charities warned last night			1
latest figures show that the proportion of women screened for early signs of cervical cancer drops from the age of 55 – and around a quarter aged 50 to 64 skip the five - minute check			1
these women are up to six times more likely to develop the disease than those who attend all their appointments , @entity21 said yesterday			0
it said regular smear tests were vitally important for older women – and urged them to attend all of their appointments			2
in @entity24 , women can have smear tests on the @entity26 every three years between the ages of 25 and 49 and then every five years until 65			1
smear tests pick up cells in the cervix , or lining of the womb , that could become cancerous and are credited with saving up to 5,000 lives a year in the @entity34			0
however , the proportion of women going for the checks falls from the age of 55			0
figures from the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) show that in 2013 , some 82 per cent of women aged 50 to 54 had been recently tested			0
this dropped to 76 per cent among 55 to 59 - year - olds and to 73 per cent among 60 to 64 - year - olds			1
there is particular concern that rates of screening among 60 to 64 - year - olds are at a 16 - year - low			1
yet the number of cases in this age group is at its highest for a decade			0
with most cases of cervical cancer triggered by the sexually transmitted disease @entity55 , some older women may believe they are protected because they have been in a long - term relationship			2
however , cervical cancer can still strike in old age and those in monogamous relationships may be at risk from @entity55 caught years earlier			0
although the bulk of the 3,000 cases a year occur in younger women , cervical cancer is more likely to be diagnosed at a later stage and to be deadly in older women			2
the issue has been thrown into the spotlight by a study of all women aged 65 to 83 diagnosed with cervical cancer in @entity24 over a five - year period			1
researchers from @entity74 found that women who did not go for a smear in their 50s or 60s were four times as likely to develop cervical cancer as those who had regular checks , the journal @entity83 reports			2
and those who did not attend were six times more likely to be diagnosed with the disease than those who had three smear tests that produced negative results			0
smear tests collect cells from the cervix of womb lining that could be cancerous , like those shown here researcher @entity94 said : ‘ screening may not be pleasant but it is quick and relatively painless and often prevents an aggressive cancer later in life			2
’ he added that as cervical cancer takes a long time to develop , the protection offered by regular smear tests in later life can extend into a woman ’s 80s			1
this means that as the population ages , the @entity26 should consider extending the upper age limit for smear tests			1
he estimates that giving women one final smear test at the age of 70 could prevent up to 200 cases of cervical cancer and save 100 lives a year			1
@entity116 , of @entity21 , which funded the study , said : ‘ these results provide reassurance that there is a real benefit to women over 50 having cervical cancer screening			2
‘ screening can pick up abnormal cells that could develop into cervical cancer if left alone			0
removing these cells prevents cancer from developing			0
’ @entity129 , chief executive of @entity131 ’s @entity130 , said : ‘ cervical cancer can be a slow - developing disease and you only need to be sexually active once in your lifetime to be at risk			0
’ there are around 1,000 deaths a year from cervical cancer .			0

figures show fewer women over 55 are being screened for cervical cancer
women have smear tests every three years between ages of 25 and 49
the @entity26 *instructs* women over 49 to be tested every five years
rates of screening among 60 - 64 year - olds at 16 - year - low
