case : a chihuahua called @entity8 has been at the center of a three - year legal battle in @entity13			1
last week she was returned to her original owners first family : the @entity33 , who now have their beloved pet back following the ruling by a judge in @entity12 , claimed that she got loose and ran away during a vacation in 2012 the pair said they made every effort to contact the owner but when they found no leads , they decided to keep it			1
five months later , the @entity43 found @entity8 and then took the @entity44 to court			1
after five hearings , a judge has decided it should return to its first home			1

a devastated @entity56 told @entity57 : ' when you 're our age and you have a dog , for some reason , it 's more than an animal ... it becomes part of your family			2
' the @entity33 on the other hand have said they are relieved their dog is home			2
speaking to the station , @entity69 said : ' it 's very emotional , it 's been a long fight			0
the fight for the dog became heated at times			0
' initially the @entity44 decided to give the dog back , but they changed their minds after the @entity43 refused to pay the veterinary bills			1
the judge ruled that in order for the dog to return to the @entity79 , they would have to pay $ 496 for the costs incurred			1
but the @entity44 insist that is a fraction of the money spent on the chihuahua in the time she was in their care and believed the figure is closer to $ 3,000			0

they also said they chose to fight for @entity8 following allegations the @entity10 family mistreated her			2

i had to wrap her up - she was wet , cold , and also in heat ! new home : the dog turned up on the porch at the home of councilman @entity20 ( pictured ) and his wife @entity22			1
they claim @entity8 was shivering when she arrived , even though it was warm outdoors @entity116 : they took the animal to the vet and then tried to track down the owner , but they decided to keep the dog when their search did not create any promising leads ' i called a groomer i know ( at home ) that sunday and asked him what to do			1
i did everything he said			0
we put up signs including at the neighborhood store and asking people we knew in the neighborhood if they knew who she belonged to			0
' @entity20 took her to our vet as a stray and had him check for a microchip - no chip			2
but when the vet did blood work on her , we found out she had liver damage			0
' to date , we have spent $ 3000 getting her healthly			0
she has to have hepatic food and medicine everyday			0
' we have had to house train her as well as train her to walk on a lease ( with a harness )			0
she would not walk through a door when she first came in may 2012			0
' the @entity44 have also filed a motion to reconsider with the courts , hoping they might get @entity8 back in the future			2
despite the allegations , the @entity43 say the dog has fitted in at home again			1
father @entity160 told the station : ' she was very excited to see all the kids			0
just snuggling and sitting and sleeping , but she 's doing real good			0
' funds : the @entity44 set up a @entity91 page in a bid to cover @entity8 's medical bills which they say were $ 3,000 allegations : on their page , they posted a text message that accused the first family of mistreating the dog			1
