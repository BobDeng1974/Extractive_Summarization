if you ’ve ever doubted just how impressive the @entity3 rocket that took astronauts to the moon was , this chart should provide a helpful reminder			1
in total 51 influential rockets are shown in height order on the graph - along with an ice cream truck and human for scale - from throughout the history of human spaceflight			1
they range from the reliable @entity17 rocket , with a remarkable 954 successful launches under its belt , to the huge @entity3 - which remains the most powerful rocket of all time			1
below is an interactive , zoomable version of the chart the chart was created by @entity26 , 24 , from @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 - and is also available to buy from @entity30 for £ 15.72 ( $ 24.22 )			1
it includes the @entity33 rocket , which was used from 1969 to 1971 , and remains the only orbital launch vehicle ever developed by the @entity35			1
further up the scale we come to the @entity39 rocket , which took the first satellite - @entity39 1 - into space on 4 october 1957			1
further still is the @entity43 rocket , which @entity44 rode on 12 april 1961 to become the first human in space			0
@entity48 ’s @entity47 ( @entity49 ) - first launch next decade lifting capability : 290,000lbs ( 130,000kg ) @entity51 launch this year 117,000lbs ( 53,000kg ) @entity53 - 1981 to 2011 53,790lbs ( 24,000kg ) @entity54 - 2004 to present 49,740lbs ( 22,560kg ) @entity55 5 - 1996 to present 44,090lbs ( 20,000kg ) @entity56 - 2004 to present 40,810lbs ( 18,510kg ) the @entity58 rocket - which had a catastrophic failure on 28 october 2014 - was slightly larger than the @entity43 rocket , but slightly shorter than @entity63 ’s @entity62 rocket			1
towards the upper end of the scale , the mighty @entity66 @entity65 rocket just beats the comparable @entity70 rocket in size			2
@entity73 ’s successfully @entity51 9 1.0 rocket , meanwhile , was a similar height to the @entity75 ( @entity75 ) , which took the @entity53 into space			2
also seen on the scale is the @entity78 clone known as the @entity78 shuttle , which was launched aboard the energia rocket			2
after one unmanned launch , however , the programme was retired in 1988			0
unfortunately , the @entity78 was later destroyed in 2002 when the hanger it was in collapsed			0
the @entity54 - currently the world ’s most powerful rocket - is also represented , but it is completely dwarfed by the two rockets at the end of the scale			1
they are the @entity92 's @entity91 rocket and the @entity94 @entity3 rocket			1
both were intended to take astronauts to the moon , but only the latter was successful			0
the @entity91 was retired after four failed launches between 1969 and 1972			2
by 2018 though , another rocket will be added to the top of this scale , when @entity48 ’s @entity47 ( @entity47 ) vehicle is scheduled to take flight in its initial configuration			2
sometime next decade it will be upgraded to enable it to be even more powerful than the @entity3 , and ultimately take astronauts to @entity109			0
the @entity3 rocket , seen here on the launch of @entity113 on 16 july 1969 , remains the most powerful rocket that has ever flown			2
it was responsible for all the @entity117 flights to the moon , and also launched @entity48 's first space station - @entity120 - in 1973 the most reliable rocket to date is arguably the @entity17 , seen here launching with a crew to the @entity123 on 23 october 2012			1
it has 954 successful launches under its belt , and continues to be used to take astronauts to the @entity123 ‘ i 've been a fan of rockets for a long time now , their immense size and power are aspects that i find interesting , ’ mr @entity26 told @entity129			1
‘ born as a tool of war , they now help us to live our modern lives in comfort and peace			0
‘ even though rockets play a vital role [ in space exploration ] , they are n't something that ’s typically newsworthy but they are something that ’s interesting to the normal person			0
‘ this is why i decided to create @entity150 , to show off 51 of the world ’s most influential rockets in a way they 've never been shown before			1
‘ some of these rockets have flown few hundreds of times but in some cases it ’s only possible to find a few out - of - focus grainy photos or technical drawings			0
‘ i wanted to change that and give a full colour look at these long forgotten vehicles as a gift to the engineers who designed them and to help us better remember a small piece our history			0
‘ basically , when i looked online i noticed a lack of drawings or images of the more important rockets and wanted to create something so that these vehicles would n’t be forgotten			0
‘ unlike cars , rockets do n’t get the same publicity and what they do for us fades away			0
a lot of these rockets are interesting but not many [ people ] know they existed			0

@entity29 @entity26 has created a chart of 51 of the world 's most influential rockets
shown in height order , they include @entity192 's reliable @entity17 rocket , which has a remarkable 954 successful launches
launchers from @entity63 , @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 and even the @entity35 also feature on the graphic
and at the top of the scale , the huge @entity3 dwarfs everything else - aside from the @entity92 's failed @entity207 rocket
