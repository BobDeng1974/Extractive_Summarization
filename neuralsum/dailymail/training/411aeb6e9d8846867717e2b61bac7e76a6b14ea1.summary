so it was great for my development			0
' @entity2 and @entity0 walk from the pitch together at @entity45 after a @entity3 defeat @entity0 was an important player in @entity2 's first @entity3 spell but was constantly troubled by injury @entity0 won two @entity11 titles and formed a dangerous partnership with @entity51 @entity0 did not make his @entity3 debut until october in his first season at @entity54 due to a broken metatarsal suffered in pre-season but he went on to form an impressive partnership with @entity51 as @entity2 's men went unbeaten in the league for the rest of the campaign			1
