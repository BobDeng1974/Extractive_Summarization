by @entity0 published : 19:05 est , 3 march 2013 updated : 02:50 est , 4 march 2013 worrying : children 's charity the @entity3 has found children as young as five are being reported to the police over sex offences , and it blames online pornography for a rise in under - 18s accused of crimes children as young as five are being reported to the police over sex offences , a charity warned last night			1
the @entity3 blamed the shocking statistics on the growing ease of access to online pornography that ‘ warps ’ young people ’s minds			1
more than 5,000 formal investigations have been launched over the past three years into under - 18s accused of crimes including rape and sexual assault , according to statistics obtained by the charity			1
it blamed the rise on hardcore porn that is readily available on the internet , warping youngsters ’ ideas about sex and relationships			1
the @entity3 ’s findings reveal that the number of sex offences allegedly committed by under - 18s has gone up 38 per cent from 1,432 in 2009/10 to 1,978 in 2011/12			1
it means that every day police are dealing with at least five children accused of sex offences			1
but the startling numbers may be the tip of the iceberg because many police forces – including some of the biggest such as the @entity48 – did not reply to the charity ’s @entity50 request			0
three of the forces that did respond – @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 and @entity56 – said their youngest cases of ‘ harmful sexual behaviour ’ had involved children aged five			0
others reported cases of youngsters aged six , seven or eight being questioned			0
because they are under ten , the age of criminal responsibility , these children can not be charged			0
it is not known what offences the youngest children were accused of committing , but harmful sexual behaviour ranges from indecent exposure and inappropriate touching at one end of the scale , to rape and sexual assault at the other			2
it also covers forcing and coercing other people into watching or taking part in inappropriate or harmful sexual behaviour			0
the @entity3 said it was likely the youngest children were guilty of the less serious offences , or were victims of abuse who were copying behaviour to which they had been subjected			1
the @entity86 has been calling for an automatic block on adult material on the web as part of its @entity92 campaign			0
ministers have pledged to introduce a less stringent filtering system for all new computers , but no timetable has yet been imposed on internet service providers , meaning children are still at risk			0
increase : the charity 's findings reveal the number of sex offences allegedly committed by under - 18s has gone up 38 per cent from 1,432 in 2009/10 to 1,978 in 2011/12 ( file picture ) only last week , a 15 - year - old boy was convicted of raping a 14 - year - old girl after becoming obsessed with online porn			1
the girl was bound , gagged , beaten up and raped as he tried to re-enact sadistic scenes he had viewed on the internet			0
her father demanded ministers take action to protect children from adult material online , particularly the ‘ extreme violent nature ’ of some easily accessible sites			2
but the @entity3 ’s figures show that the situation is more widespread than it was thought , and is getting worse			1
@entity120 , policy adviser at the @entity3 , said : ‘ we hope our findings will ring alarm bells with the authorities that this is a problem which needs urgent attention			1
in some cases older children are attacking younger ones and in other cases it ’s sexual violence within a teenage relationship			0
campaign : the @entity86 has been calling for an automatic block on adult material on the web as part of its @entity92 campaign ( file picture ) ‘ while more research needs to be done on this problem , we know that technology and easy access to sexual material is warping young people ’s views of what is normal or acceptable behaviour			0
‘ we are treating an increasing number of children who have carried out online grooming , harassment in chatrooms and “ sexting ”			1
’ @entity156 , from the @entity157 on internet safety , said : ‘ it ’s very alarming to realise that children as young as five are being caught up in the consequences of the sexualisation of modern @entity164			0
‘ the impact of this on a child of five will potentially live with them and scar them for the rest of their lives			0
’ the scale of sexual offences committed by children was revealed after the @entity3 approached all 43 police forces in @entity178 and @entity179 , and received responses from 34 of them			1
a total of 5,028 offences categorised as ‘ harmful sexual behaviour ’ were recorded between 2009/10 and 2011/12 where the perpetrator was under 18			2
@entity187 , @entity188 and the @entity48 in @entity189 were among those unable to give data – meaning the real total will be far higher			0
figures from those that did respond show that 98 per cent of the 4,562 offenders were boys			2
and where the relationship was recorded , at least three out of five of the victims knew the abuser			0
more than one third of the offences were said to have been committed by a family friend or acquaintance , and one in five by family members			2
the @entity3 , which provides treatment to help reform children who exhibit signs of harmful sexual behaviour , said easy access to indecent material may be behind the increase in the numbers being treated			2
miss @entity120 said : ‘ evidence shows that most young people who receive behaviour - changing treatment early on will not continue to sexually abuse others or grow into adult offenders			2
’ the largest number of offences was recorded by @entity55 and @entity56 police , with 633 over the past three years , closely followed by @entity53 on 595			1
@entity222 was @entity223 with 351 offences , followed by @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity54 and @entity227 , which each recorded 250 or more offences			2
last year @entity229 , the deputy children ’s commissioner , told @entity230 that online porn was turning children into sex attackers			1
she said : ‘ it has definitely affected children ’s thresholds of what they think is normal			0

more than 5,000 investigations launched over the past three years
@entity3 blames figures on hardcore porn readily available online
