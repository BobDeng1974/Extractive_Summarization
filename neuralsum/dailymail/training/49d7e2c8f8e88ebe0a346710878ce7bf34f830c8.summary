by @entity0 she launched her new lifestyle website preserve amid great fanfare this week , admitting : ' i ’m no editor , no artisan , no expert '			1
but @entity6 's foray into foraging for the best of ' @entity9 , @entity8 ' , is having some teething problems as it draws critics over her top , somewhat eccentric , picks to buy			1
perhaps the most bizarre object for sale so far is a $ 95 @entity17 wooden crate , similar to one you could pick up at the market			2
in flowery raptures , the boxes are described as : ' the bones of old @entity23 get a new lease on life in these @entity27 - style bicycle crates			2
caboose it onto your bike to carry the day ’s produce , impromptu flowers for your sweetheart , or whatever you need to transport in a stylish manner — emission - free ! ' indeed , as the @entity55 points out , similar crates are on sale on ebay for just 99 cents , as writer @entity58 said the site just makes her ' want to each the rich '			1
preserve : @entity6 's new lifestyle website has n't gotten off to the best start similarly , there is a crystal bowl for $ 450 by @entity65 designs that @entity6 assures us will impart ' beauty , imagination and warmth to those who welcome these captivating crystals into their home			1
' however , so far , many of the products on that site that seems to take inspiration from @entity79 winner @entity78 's lifestyle haven , @entity80 , have imparted scorn			1
fashion blogger @entity82 tweeted : ' after visiting @entity6 's new site , i 'd like to preserve my dignity by preserving my opinions where the sun does n't shine			1
' @entity90 , the artisan salt collection by @entity89 is for sale at $ 40 is billed with the message : ' it 's been said , variety is the spice of life			1
' diversify yours with this sensorily sophisticated set of splendid seasonings			2
' the pack includes a ' fantasia of far - flung flavors ' including @entity102 , @entity103 , and @entity105 salt , while varying flavors start at $ 10			2
and for budding chefs , pick up a $ 140 @entity110 's @entity109 or $ 110 @entity108 , from by @entity111 , with the description : ' running a restaurant is messy business ' adding that aprons include ' classic pinstripe fabric and pockets convenient for both chef and wait staff			1
' while @entity120 and @entity121 ( $ 25 ) will leave you ' a legend of backyard barbecues , your culinary star rising among all who savor your victorious victuals			1
' and of course there 's pickles			1
' anytime is a good time for a great pickle ! ' according to @entity34 , which is selling @entity133 by @entity133 for $ 18.50			1
' enjoy them straight out of the jar , or chop them up and add flecks of capricious character to tuna salads and deviled eggs			2
' flavors include @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144 and the site declares : ' oh , the crunch of a punchy pickle ! flush with fresh dill and dripping with delicious brine			2
' along with a pricy ' @entity150 ' ( a fancy wall light ) by @entity152 for $ 300 , @entity34 has also curated thought bubbles by the same designer priced between $ 250 and $ 300 , because ' any thought merits a spot on the board '			1
indeed , the site urges you to ' spark your bulb and bring a fresh light to your thinking process with the @entity163			2
make sure to jot down that brilliant idea ! '			0
if you 're in the mood for a sailboat bow tie , it 's yours for $ 70 , as is a cactus flower necktie for $ 100			1
' crafted exclusively in the @entity169 , their creations combine modern whimsy with the exacting standards of old fashioned quality , ' @entity34 boasts			1
' oh the crunch of a punchy pickle !

for coffee table fans , the website also has on sale a first edition hardcopy book titled @entity200 , with the note : ' whether it 's white sugar sprinkled on top of beignets like fresh snowflakes , a fiery festival complete with torches , or a jazz musician pouring his soul through a trumpet , this tome celebrates the creative circus of the city that is @entity215			1
' it 's not just the carefully curated and crafted items for sale that have drawn scorn			1
an introductory video clip , which was created by @entity221 , which features a young girl writing in a journal underneath a tree while @entity226 , a work by late @entity229 philosopher @entity228 , is read aloud in the background , has been called a ' nightmare ' by @entity232 , which called the entire site a ' horror movie '			1
it seems @entity6 , 26 , who made her name on tv hit @entity238 , gained inspiration for the website 's name from her wedding day			1
the star wore a couture @entity245 gown when she ecretly tied the knot with actor @entity248 at @entity249 in @entity250			1
@entity251 , @entity252 , two years ago			0
and she recently revealed that the custom - made dress was damaged at her wedding reception - though @entity248 helped her cope with the disappointment			0
critic : fashion blogger @entity82 said he wanted to ' preserve his opinions where the sun does n't shine ' oh so that 's what you do with a $ 95 crate : the @entity264 on sale on preserve just what you always wanted ! speech bubbles by @entity152 range from $ 250 - $ 300 ' @entity270 was singing at the reception , and they brought out these sparklers , and i ’m watching her sing			1
i look down and my wedding dress has a big burn mark from one of the sparklers			0
right on the front ! and it was just so heartbreaking to me , ' she tells @entity282 in the magazine 's august issue			2
she continued : ' and later , my dress was hanging up and @entity248 said , " is n’t that beautiful ? " i said , " what ? " and he pointed to the burn			0
my heart just stopped , because it was such a sensitive little subject			0
and he said , " you ’ll always remember that moment with @entity292 singing and the sparklers			0
you have that forever , right there , preserved			0
" now that ’s my favorite part of the dress			0
' she admits she has found it hard to launch the site , writing in her editor 's letter : ' i ’m more intimidated than i should probably admit			2
i ’m no editor , no artisan , no expert			0
and certainly no arbiter of what you should buy , wear , or eat			2
' i am hungry , though ... not just for enchiladas			0
i 'm hungry for experience			0
' i 'm comfortable with the knowledge that i 'm not a teacher , but rather , a student			0
i do n't do any one thing perfectly			0
i do a lot of things though			0
some well , some not - so - well			0
' happy couple : @entity6 and @entity248 , seen here at @entity317 in may 2014 , have been married almost two years if you want to be a serious chef , you need a $ 110 @entity110 's apron - and perhaps a book of love letters to @entity215 for $ 35 that 's an expensive way to say i love you : a $ 300 ' @entity324 ' for sale on preserve according to @entity6 , she and her team think of the site not as a lifestyle website but a ' new street			1
' ' a sort of greatest hits of " @entity9 , @entity8 "			0
while the whole world races to keep up with technology , we tighten our laces , join the race , but our end goal is to preserve what 's already there			2
however , now that they both have lifestyle sites , do n't expect @entity6 to start a war with @entity78			0
the @entity238 star recently name dropped her fellow online retail blogger , telling @entity282 she is always in both the actress 's and @entity349 's corner			1
@entity6 said : ' i ’m always the first person to defend @entity78			0
or any woman in a position of power , like @entity349 or @entity354 , who gets burned			0
because they have paved the path for so many other women who are doing something they believe in			0

@entity238 star 's website @entity34 launched on monday
