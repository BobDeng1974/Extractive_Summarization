a @entity1 official was forced to ask the @entity4 supporters ' band to stop playing during tuesday night 's friendly against @entity5 in @entity6 after it inadvertently provided background music to @entity9 singing			1
some of the 5,000 away supporters sang foul - mouthed @entity9 songs while the band played @entity13 - a song it regularly performs during @entity4 matches - during the 3 - 1 victory for @entity16 's side at @entity17			1
many @entity4 fans sang ' f * * * the @entity19 ' on several occasions during the match and , in the first half , an @entity1 official contacted the band to ask it to stop playing the song because it was innocently providing the tune for the offensive singing			1
three @entity29 fans show their support for the @entity4 players during their side 's friendly clash against @entity5 - there is no suggestion that any of the fans pictured took part in the @entity9 chanting 5,000 @entity4 fans made the trip across the border and the @entity29 gave them plenty of reasons to cheer - there is no suggestion that any of the fans pictured took part in the @entity9 chanting @entity4 fans were in buoyant mood before tuesday 's friendly match at @entity17 - there is no suggestion that any of the fans pictured took part in the @entity9 chanting the band has since come in for severe criticism , but its leader @entity54 says he had no idea about the issue until he was notified about it by one of his colleagues			1
@entity54 instead thought the band was providing the tune to a song called ' @entity13 ' rather than anything to do with the @entity19 , and apologised for any offence			1
' we were absolutely not aware of it ( the @entity19 chants ) , ' said @entity54			0
' all the fans around us were singing " @entity13 "			0
' it was only when a band member saw on @entity71 that some people were saying we were playing @entity9 songs that we became aware			2
' then we immediately stopped and played something else			0
' @entity54 , who formed the @entity4 band 21 years ago , added : ' if anyone was offended by what was happening , then obviously we are not very happy about that			2
the @entity4 supporters ' band , pictured in @entity81 at @entity82 , were told to stop playing by a @entity1 official ' the @entity1 have apologised and we would go along with that if anyone was offended			1
' @entity16 was unaware of the chanting , but apologised for any offence on behalf of the @entity1 , who could take further action particularly when @entity4 are due to play in @entity90 next june			1
he said : ' i was aware the crowd were tremendously supportive			0
i did n't have a clue what they were chanting			0
' i do n't condone it			0
if anyone was offended , i 'm sure the @entity1 would like to apologise to them			0
' all we can do is play our football and be grateful for the support and hopefully they will behave themselves and not get themselves into a situation where their chanting is being criticised			0
' @entity108 salutes the travelling support after leading his side to a 3 - 1 victory against @entity5 @entity4 boss @entity16 apologised on behalf of his fans who were chanting @entity9 songs @entity4 fans had behaved well in the build - up to the match , joining in with a minute 's applause for @entity5 supporter @entity118 , who died from a fall at @entity17 during the @entity121 match on friday			1
but once the match had begun some @entity29 supporters tainted their reputation when the @entity9 songs began			1
@entity16 admitted that he had long ago stopped listening to what fans are singing during matches			2
asked about the chants on @entity129 , he said : ' after a long career in football , i learnt long ago that the crowd are either signing or are silent in the background but when they chant or sing most of the time i do n't have a clue			2
' i thought their support was excellent			0
i will leave any discussion about any words they have used			0
' @entity144 reported no football - related disorder in the immediate aftermath of the match and said they had not received any reports of offensive chants .			2

some @entity4 fans *hijacked* the band 's tune to sing @entity9 song
three @entity29 fans joined in with minute 's applause for fan who *tragically* died during @entity5 's recent match against the @entity121
@entity16 apologised on behalf of his fans despite not hearing chants
