by @entity0 follow @ @ marthakelner @entity1 has not been clothes shopping since sir @entity3 died almost a year ago			1
it was always her husband who would pop down to a local boutique in @entity8 and choose a new dress for @entity10 , something special for her when he had a fancied runner			2
he would urge her to try it on			2
almost always it was perfect			2
to go shopping without him would be too painful right now , particularly with @entity17 just around the corner			1
‘ he loved @entity8 , he loved @entity20 but he adored @entity17 , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ everything about it , the top - class racing , he loved all the fashion			2
he just had really great style			2
i ’d go into a shop and say , “ oh no , there ’s nothing here ” and he ’d pick something off the rail … and it ’d be just right			2
‘ a good week before @entity17 he ’d be laying out his outfit			2
his tie , his handkerchief , socks and shoes , everything co-ordinated			2
he just really looked forward to it			2
’ the best : sir @entity39 died almost a year ago and pictured with @entity40 , known to be one of the greatest horses ever to race race : @entity1 can not even go shopping because it reminds her too much of sir @entity3 last year ’s @entity17 was just a week after sir @entity3 ’s death on june 11 , 2013			1
‘ it ’s going to be just as difficult this year without him			2
everyone says time ’s a great healer			2
the strange thing is , i miss him more and more not less and less			2
‘ i do n’t know whether it ’s because now the training operation is not as all - consuming as it was			0
i just miss him more , ’ says @entity1 , her voice faltering and eyes welling up			1
’ in the kitchen at @entity61 , the home sir @entity3 had lived in since the @entity63 , reminders of him are everywhere			1
photographs of him with his grandchildren are displayed on the dresser , books about him and @entity40 the wonder horse lay on the table			0
the fruit bowl bears his name			0
but there is also evidence of rebirth			0
@entity1 proudly shows me the front page of the @entity79 , her local paper			1
the main picture is of the @entity61 team — her team — celebrating the victory of @entity83 in the @entity84 at @entity85 last sunday			0
it was a first @entity87 success since sir @entity3 ’s death			1
he trained 114 in his 44 - year training career			0
this was @entity1 ’s first			1
it was sir @entity3 ’s habit to fly the @entity93 of @entity95 flag , bearing the coat of arms of his @entity98 aristocratic family , every time he trained a @entity87 winner			1
and so , last sunday , @entity1 ’s daughter @entity100 — a trained solicitor who works as her secretary — proudly hoisted the aged colours up the flagpole at @entity61			1
‘ i flew back on sunday night , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ we all met in the bar upstairs at @entity107 airport			0
lord @entity108 [ racing manager for @entity83 ’s owner @entity110 ] , his wife @entity115 , @entity113 [ @entity112 , jockey ] @entity111 [ @entity114 , assistant trainer ] and i. @entity113 showed me his phone and my nephew , @entity117 , had put a picture of the flag on twitter			0
‘ that was our main target when i took up the licence last year so it was very special to be able to get the flag up for @entity3			1
’ trainer : sir @entity3 greets @entity40 after his victory in the @entity125 in 2012 when @entity83 arrived home on monday , the team assembled under the flagpole with a glass of champagne			1
@entity1 calls them her extended family			1
there had been scepticism when she took over the training operation after her husband ’s death			0
some thought the yard would wither away without his magic			0
several owners removed their horses			0
‘ i believe there was [ some negativity ] but nobody says it to your face , do they ? ’ she says			0
‘ i suppose some people thought we were mad and i woke up sometimes myself thinking i was mad but we just had so much going for us here			0
‘ it would have been so hard for my staff if i ’d given up and those horses , their horses , had gone somewhere else			0
‘ it was also a welcome distraction			0
when you ’ve got 100 horses and 60 staff as we did at the time , you ca n’t just hide away			2
’ crucially , prince @entity110 and the @entity162 left their horses with her and she has justified their faith , with 35 winners from 156 runners , an enviable 22.45 per cent strike rate			0
perhaps it would have been easy to give up but for @entity1 , @entity61 equals sir @entity3			1
the vegetable garden , which he designed in the grounds , remains unaltered			0
the figs he loved to eat continue to grow and the scent from the pink and yellow roses that he loved tending to hangs thick in the air			0
it is when she stands on top of the heath watching her third lot of the day walk down the hill and canter back up that @entity1 , who married sir @entity3 in 2008 , feels closest to him			1
‘ sometimes i ’m on my own and that ’s a very special place because i think of all the hundreds and hundreds of hours that @entity3 stood out there probably standing on the same spot , ’ she says			1
‘ i ’m sure it all seems to the other trainers that it ’s not the same without him and i ’m sure it will be a long time before everyone gets used to it , really			1
‘ but the warmth everybody felt from @entity3 has been partly transferred on to me			1
often people are just out on the heath watching the horses and they tell me about meeting @entity3 15 years ago , and it ’s just so vivid in their memory			1
two years ago : sir @entity3 at @entity199 in 2012 ‘ he did n’t know who they were , he just saw that they were up for the day			1
they were standing at the fence and he made them come across to him			0
i still have people write to me and say he touched their lives			0
you can never tell me enough things about @entity3			1
’ @entity1 was granted a temporary licence and did a course at the @entity212 to get her full licence			1
much of it she had already learned subconsciously from @entity3			1
‘ @entity111 [ @entity114 ] must get sick to death of me saying , “ @entity3 would have done this or @entity3 would have done that ”			1
on the whole , we try to keep it as much the same as @entity3 would have had it			2
but , of course , it ’s impossible because with him it was instinct			0
lots of people say he was a genius — and he was			0
you can not teach that			0
’ even in the week before his death , sir @entity3 would be instructing his wife from his hospital bed on pairing riders with horses			1
‘ he could n’t contemplate not being around , ’ says @entity1			2
‘ he just wanted to live			0
it was n’t something that even occurred to him until the last couple of days and it was so important to him to think that he could have got better			0
he just did so well for so long that we just thought he was invincible … and he was for so long			0
’ she keeps sir @entity3 ’s legacy alive with every winner and she is keen to nurture more horses to the winning post			1
‘ you always want to build on what you ’ve got , ’ she says			0
‘ we went down in numbers but it would be lovely if people saw what we were doing and said , “ oh , they ’re doing quite well at @entity61 again ”			0
‘ but i ’m just so lucky to be doing something that i love			0
it ’s a huge responsibility but there are these huge rewards and every day , rain or shine , it ’s still lovely out there			0
’ the team : sir @entity3 with jockey @entity259 and @entity40 after winning the @entity260			1

@entity1 can not even go shopping because it is ' too painful ' without sir @entity3
sir @entity39 died of cancer aged *70* and was *renowned* for being one of the greatest trainers of all time
