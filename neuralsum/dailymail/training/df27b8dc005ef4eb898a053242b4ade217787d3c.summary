a pastor at @entity1 in @entity2 , was spoken to by police after this poster appeared on the church 's notice board a baptist church was at the centre of a police probe after a sign which suggested non-christians would ' burn in hell ' was investigated as a ' hate incident '			1
the offending sign at @entity1 in @entity2 , pictured burning flames below words which read : ' if you think there is no @entity19 you better be right ! ! '			1
now the church has been forced to remove the sign after a passer - by complained to police that it could ' not be further ' from the @entity24 phrase , love thy neighbour			1
@entity27 , 20 , said : ' it is my basic understanding that @entity24 is inclusive and loving in nature			1
' the message being displayed outside of the church could not be further from the often uttered phrase ‘ love thy neighbour ’			0
' mr @entity27 said he was ' astounded ' when he spotted the poster by chance as he was walking home			1
he said : ' i was just astounded really			0
we live in the 21st century and they have put that message - that non-christians will burn in hell - up to try and scare people into joining their mentality			2
' the strongly - worded sign - which was put up next to a notice board which promises that visitors ' can always be sure of a very warm welcome ' - was taken down by pastor @entity48 , 69 , after police launched an investigation into the complaint			1
mr @entity48 said he ' regretted ' how the poster could have been interpreted			2
he said : ' @entity1 offers a variety of ways in which people are able to engage with the @entity24 message			1
' @entity57 encourages us to love @entity19 and to love our neighbour and we therefore regret that the poster has been seen as inciting hatred			1
' indeed , we want to assure all members of our local community that they would be made to feel very welcome at any of the church 's activities			0
' mr @entity48 said he changed the posters on his notice board every two weeks			0
the poster has now been replaced by another one with the message : ' @entity19 loves you ! ' and a picture of a meerkat and a speech bubble saying : ' @entity75 '			1
@entity27 , 20 , complained to police about the poster after saying it suggested non-christians would ' burn in hell '			1
he said the poster ' could not be further away from the often uttered phrase ' love thy neighbour ' but despite the sign now being removed , it has still caused controversy in the church 's local area			2
@entity90 , from @entity91 , branded the sign ' pernicious nonsense '			0
he said : ' i believe the people of @entity1 have more common sense than to give this sign any credence			2
' @entity98 , president of the @entity99 , also defended the church and said police involvement was the equivalent of ' banning the @entity104 '			0
he said : ' personally i do n’t find it offensive			0
but we did fight a long battle of freedom of speech together with @entity24 groups because we believe that freedom of speech is essential to a functioning society			2
the church has now taken down the poster after being spoken to by police ' if you do n’t give free speech to everybody then it is n’t free speech and as long as they are n’t inciting violence then i think it is acceptable to say whatever you want to say			2
' but the @entity123 , of the @entity124 , said : ' i guess they are trying to open a conversation and cause people to think			0
' however , i think there are more positive conversations that you could have and more positive reasons for coming to church			0
' a @entity2 police spokesman said : ' @entity135 received a report regarding a poster outside a church in @entity1 which was deemed offensive by the complainant			1
' national guidance required us to investigate the circumstances and the matter has been recorded as a hate incident			1
' having spoken to the pastor of the church , it has been agreed the poster will be taken down			2
' the controversy has echoes of a freedom of speech debate sparked in january 2009 , after the @entity151 launched an anti-religion advertising campaign on @entity154 buses			0
the campaign was made up of posters disputing the existence of god , which read : ' there ’s probably no god			0
now stop worrying and enjoy your life			0
' the campaign was originally intended for buses in @entity154 , but the appeal spread across the country because it became so popular .			0
