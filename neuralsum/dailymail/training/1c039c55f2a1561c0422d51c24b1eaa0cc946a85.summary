by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:13 est , 9 september 2013 updated : 10:38 est , 9 september 2013 @entity3 bosses are to give @entity5 ’s wife @entity4 a more high profile role in a bid to give her husband a popularity boost			1
the child actress - turned - barrister is expected to make a series of public appearances and speeches at the @entity3 conference last this month to ‘ humanise ’ her husband			1
but the decision to use ms @entity17 on the political frontline will draw comparisons with failed attempts by @entity21 and @entity22 to use their other halves to rescue their leadership			1
mr @entity5 repeatedly said he would not copy @entity36 ’s habit of eye - catching photo opportunities while opposition leader , and would instead focus on policies			1
but with the @entity3 lead over the @entity42 narrowing in the polls , and @entity3 rocked by the threat of unions withdrawing millions in funding , ms @entity17 has been persuaded to speak out			1
labour planners have pencilled in a series of appearances at the conference in @entity51 from september 22 , far and beyond the traditional embrace at the end of the leader ’s speech			1
a @entity3 government would impose a crackdown on the use of zero - hours contracts by ' exploitative ' employers , @entity5 is to promise trade unions			1
as many as 5.5 million people could be on the controversial arrangements under which workers do not know if they have work from one week to the next , according to a survey of @entity68 members			2
it says the ' staggering ' figure - five times previous estimates - show there is a ' growing sub class ' of insecure , low paid employees earning an average of £ 500 a month			2
mr @entity5 will tell the @entity75 that while zero hours contracts are useful in some cases they have been ' terribly misused ' in many others			1
under his proposals employers would be banned from insisting zero - hours workers be available even when there is no guarantee of any work			2
ms @entity17 will address fringe meetings and parties and be photographed with activists from across the country			1
a @entity3 source said : ‘ you will be seeing a lot more of @entity4 at conference this year			1
' she is a huge asset to @entity5 , she is a huge asset to the @entity3 but she is her own person			1
' she is a career woman with two young children			0
' ‘ she comes across better than him , frankly , ’ said another source			0
the couple met in 2005 and got married in 2011			0
mr @entity5 faces a rough ride at his conference over his plans to reform @entity3 's historic links with the trade unions			1
@entity107 's union leaders yesterday branded the @entity3 leader a ‘ schoolboy ’ – and warned he was ‘ living in cloud cuckoo land ’ if he thought his party reforms would succeed			1
@entity112 , general - secretary of @entity113 , said @entity107 ’s biggest public sector union would cut its annual funding to @entity3 by £ 210,000 after the number of members saying they wanted their fees to go to the party plummeted			1
he also claimed mr @entity5 ’s reforms would lead to a landslide defeat in the next election			1
the @entity124 union has already announced it will slash its funding by £ 1million , with others expected to follow suit			0
@entity3 's shadow business secretary @entity128 admitted the plan to force union members to actively opt - in to become members of the party will lead to a drop in funding			1
he told @entity135 : '' i think undoubtedly it is going to , we ’re going to take a hit in terms of our finances			0
we will see [ how much ] , but that does n’t mean that it is n’t the right thing to do			0
' of course people will be resistant to change , change frightens people , that is a perfectly natural human instinct but we have got to do this			0
' wed : the couple , who met in 2005 , tied the knot at @entity152 country hotel in @entity153 in may 2011 @entity154 , @entity3 's deputy leader , will use a speech to the @entity75 congress tonight to call for unity amid fears the row with unions will cause lasting damage to mr @entity5			1
' we need to remember that fundamentally we 're fighting for the same things - that we are on the same side , ' she will say			0
' if we do n't have unity , there is going to be winners and losers			0
the winners will be the @entity42 and the losers will be our constituents and your members			0
this is a dangerous moment			0
' ms @entity17 is no stranger to the cameras			1
as a teenager , she carved out a career as an actor , starring in the @entity180 series @entity178 , which ran from 1983 and helped launch the careers of talent including writer @entity183 and actor @entity184			2
smiles : labour insiders were delighted with the reaction in april to ms @entity17 's appearance alongside husband @entity5 on a tour of her old school , @entity191 in @entity192 @entity193 : advisers hope the sight of the @entity196 together in @entity51 will change the way voters view the @entity3 leader she also appeared in 1987 school - based sitcom @entity202 , which was axed after just two episodes after being mauled by critics			1

‘ but i think she would n’t have had any time for me			0
’ turning to his wife he added : ‘ you were obviously too cool – this is what i now realise			0
’ it sets the scene for a battle of the political wives in the run - up to the 2015 general election			0
history repeating : in 2009 labour prime minister @entity21 was introduced on stage at the party conference by wife @entity252 who paid tribute to ' my husband , my hero ' @entity259 tactic : @entity22 was regularly seen with his wife @entity260 as his leadership faltered			2
