by @entity0 published : 06:22 est , 5 september 2012 updated : 11:00 est , 5 september 2012 parents of a baby girl whose heart stopped for four minutes believe she came back to life thanks to her great - grandfather who died just five days before from a heart attack in the same cubicle			1
@entity8 was discovered by father @entity9 in her cot at the family home in @entity12 , @entity13 , suffering a fit which left her fighting for breath			1
@entity9 and mother @entity17 dialled 999 and within minutes they were on board an ambulance as paramedics fought to save @entity8 ’s life			1
family : @entity8 seriously ill in hospital , and right with great - grandfather @entity26 who died from a heart attack in the same cubicle just five days before @entity8 was rushed to @entity30 's @entity29 the family arrived at @entity30 ’s @entity29 just as her heart stopped and paramedic @entity33 leapt from the vehicle to run inside with the lifeless child			1
in an agonising coincidence as doctors fought to save their daughter ’s life , @entity40 and mrs @entity8 realised she was being treated in the same cubicle @entity9 ’s grandfather @entity26 had suffered a fatal heart attack in just five days before			1
but after four minutes mrs @entity8 , 29 , and mr @entity45 , 31 , were stunned as their little girl came back to life			1
in less than 24 hours @entity8 was awake and breathing on her own , shocking doctors who said she would n’t be able to do so for at least two days			1
relief : @entity9 and @entity17 with baby @entity8 whose heart stopped for four minutes but she astounded doctors and came back to life			1
now her parents think her great - grandfather was watching over her now , two weeks later , @entity8 is back home with her sister @entity56 , five , and mrs @entity8 said they believed 100 per cent that @entity26 was watching over her			1
doctors also said @entity8 was the first baby to have been successfully resuscitated after being brought in by ambulance suffering a cardiac arrest in five years			1
mrs @entity8 said : ' @entity26 was definitely watching over @entity8			1
we have had a lot of heartache over the years , i think @entity26 decided we were n’t going to have any more tragedy			1
' as @entity8 was being resuscitated @entity9 was saying ‘ not that cubicle ’ as we knew it was where @entity26 had suffered his heart attack but the team were obviously still working on her			1
worry : mrs @entity8 first realised something was wrong as she and her husband heard a noise come from @entity8 ’s room ( she 's pictured the day before she fell ill , left , and right with big sister @entity56 when she was born ) ' that four minutes were a nightmare , i was so upset my hands had frozen like claws			2
when she came back they put her straight onto life support but early sunday morning the consultant would only tell us she was ‘ a very , very poorly girl ’			2
' she was supposed to be sedated and on a breathing tube until monday at least			0
i think her recovery surprised everyone , by sunday afternoon they were still trying to keep her sedated and on breathing apparatus but she was having none of it , she was waking up and pulling out the tube			0
' finally about 5pm the consultant said if she wants to wake she can wake up and over the next week she just got stronger and stronger			0
' mrs @entity8 said she first realised something was wrong as she and her husband sat in the family garden with friends and heard a noise come from @entity8 ’s room at around 10pm on saturday , august 18			2
she said she discovered later @entity8 had suffered from febrile convulsions - a condition often triggered by and underlying infection causing the baby ’s body temperature to spike suddenly			2
the condition is quite common in young children but @entity8 ’s reaction was exceptional			2
experts : @entity8 was taken to @entity30 's @entity29 where it took four rounds of @entity106 to revive her she said : ' babies can not sweat like an adult can and usually these convulsions pass without any ill effects , it just happened that @entity8 was n’t so lucky			2
' we heard a noise from @entity8 ’s room , usually she knocks a toy in her cot and it makes a sound when it hits the side , then she calls out because she wants some milk			2
' but this time i thought ‘ that ’s odd she is n’t making a sound ’ , @entity9 went upstairs to check on her and then shouted down ‘ call 999 ’			0
- around one in 50 children will have a febrile convulsion by the time they reach the age of five - children under five can not regulate their body temperature so the fits are a way of expending the heat through the muscle and the skin - a febrile convulsion is caused by a rapid rise in a child ’s temperature usually at the start of a bacterial or viral illness			0
a child ’s temperature may have reached @entity145 or 39c but it is thought that the rate of rise , rather than the final temperature , is more important			0
- during a febrile convulsion , a child loses consciousness and becomes either stiff or floppy			0
they may stop breathing briefly and their eyes can roll back			2
a child may be irritable or sleepy after coming round			0
- it ’s important to keep calm as most convulsions pass without ill effect , however if the child is not breathing normally after a convulsion , or if it lasts five minutes or more , you need to get emergency help by dialling 999			0
' @entity8 was grey , she was dribbling and fighting for breath , the ambulance was there in under four minutes and we jumped in the back with @entity8			1
' engineer mr @entity45 said when he first saw his daughter he knew something was wrong			0
he said : ' she was struggling to breath , her eyes were glazed over and she was grey , it ’s not a sight any parent wants to see			0
' i think @entity26 was watching over her in hospital but we have to say a massive thank you to all the doctors and paramedics who helped save her life			1
' i had said goodbye to @entity26 on monday and on saturday @entity8 was being treated in the same bed he had a massive heart attack in , it was a roller coaster of emotions			1
' there was a moment when the machines stopped beeping when we realised they had got her back and they all did a fantastic job , not just the @entity198 but in intensive care afterwards			0
' mrs @entity8 said when the ambulance arrived at @entity198 unusually there were four paediatric consultants on duty when normally there would be just one			0
as the ambulance pulled up @entity8 ’s heart stopped and mrs @entity8 said paramedic and mother - of - two @entity33 ran inside carrying her to medics			2
ms @entity33 , from the @entity209 , said it took four rounds of cpr to bring her back			0
she said : ' the minute we got to the house and saw @entity17 jumping up and down we knew something was wrong , when i ran into the house and picked @entity8 up in my arms and knew she was very poorly and things were going down hill ' in the ambulance on the way her jaw locked meaning it was hard to keep her airway open which was already partially blocked with saliva			0
' she went into cardiac arrest as we arrived and as i ran into the hospital i was numb and in shock , we did n’t know if she would survive but we were greeted by no less than four consultants , a couple of specialist registrars and nurses and they went to work immediately			0
' febrile convulsions are relatively common but in 15 years in the job i have never seen a reaction like @entity8 ’s			0
