there are 177,147 ways to fasten a necktie , it has emerged - 1,000 times more than previously thought			1
but the study was not prompted by higher theories of mathematics , but a flamboyant knot worn by a super-villain in @entity10 blockbuster @entity9			1
the @entity11 , named after a @entity13 royal dynasty , wore his tie in the little - known @entity17 knot , which features two loops around the top of the knot and leaves the skinny part of the tie hanging on top			1
unorthodox : fans were flummoxed at trying to copy the tie knot worn by @entity11 ( pictured ) in @entity9 - as the style was hidden much of the time by it being a black tie on a black shirt tradition : for years men have opted for the @entity33 ( right ) or the @entity34 ( left ) - there are 177,145 others his was perhaps the most unusual in a series of unorthodox tie knots in the film trilogy , which prompted viral tutorial videos on @entity42 from fans trying to copy their style			1
mathematician @entity45 , of the @entity46 in @entity47 , @entity48 , watched the videos and realised the ' merovingian knot ' was missing from a major 2000 study by researchers at @entity53			1
along with three other mathematicians , he created a formula for devising tie knots using just three symbols , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 he said : ' t is a clockwise ( turnwise ) move of the knot - tying blade , @entity58 is a counter-clockwise move , and @entity65 tucks the blade under a previous bow			2
' @entity68 to start with an inwards or outwards crossing can be deduced by counting the total number of @entity58 in the knot description string , and all possible strings in @entity58 and @entity59 produce possible tie knots			0
' and now for something completely different : the random knot generator lists some of the combinations fancy something different today ? the website features complicated letter - based sequences it 'll tie you up in knots : one of the 177,000 tie knots which can be achieved according to new research from the tool , known in logic as formal language theory , he has created a random tie generator which uses the mathematics to teach internet users how to tie random knots			2
according to the @entity94 , the @entity53 researchers had wrongly assumed people would only make a tuck – folding one end of the tie under the rest to finish the knot – at the end , and that all knots would be covered by a flat stretch of fabric			0
but their theory did not account for the elaborate knots found in @entity107 , with several tucks and ruffled fabric			0
the researchers also changed one crucial rule - the limit to how many winding moves people could make before their tie became ludicrously short			0
the team put that number at 11 - meaning there are 177,147 possible knots in the world			0
but who could find enough time to tie them all ? visit the random tie knot generator here .			0

study by mathematician in @entity47 , @entity48 , looked at complex knots
he was inspired to *improve* on *seminal* 2000 study by @entity9
the film *'s* @entity11 character had a *bizarre* tie knot aped on @entity42
study now *offers* 177,147 ways to fasten a tie - but could you do them all ?
