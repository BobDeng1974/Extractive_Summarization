by @entity0 lobbyists are buying up ad space on @entity3 to get their message across to sports - mad president @entity5 and his @entity8 team			1
political strategists have revealed how they have begun suggesting the all - sports network to clients who want @entity5 and his officials to hear their concerns			2
the president and his staff , as well as other influential @entity17 figures , are reputed to be regular viewers of the broadcaster , which currently has a near monopoly on sports coverage			1
president @entity5 does a behind the back move with a basketball : lobbyists have begun taking out ads on sports network @entity3 that are targeted at the sports - mad president and his team that 's despite one @entity3 host branding the commander - in - chief 's dismal display of his own basketball skills last month ' the most embarrassing moment of his entire presidency			1
' companies and organisations have been cagey about the tactic , but those suspected of using it include @entity44 , the @entity45 and the @entity46			0
@entity47 of bipartisan public affairs firm @entity48 told @entity49 that he and colleagues had begun advising clients to advertise on @entity3			2
' the data is clear that a significant amount of elites and influencers are watching @entity3 and sports programs and that there is really a high value to being on those networks , ' he said			1
' you are much more likely to get the eyeballs you want than being on some other places			0
' @entity44 is one of the companies that have taken out adverts on @entity3 that seem more directed at decision makers rather than consumers			0
the personal computer software giant took out slots on @entity71 programming to directly criticise rival @entity72 as part of its @entity75 campaign			0
that campaign , which is still running on @entity3 in @entity17 , raised questions about @entity72 's business practices just as federal watchdogs considered taking action against the online ads and search firm over competition issues			0
@entity5 and wife @entity84 watch a game : media strategists say there is clear data to show that influential political figures are increasingly watching sports but advertisers with an issue to push are not just using @entity3 to target influential political figures			1
strategists say the broadcaster is one of the few that people still watch in real - time , and adverts can also reach important non-ideological voters whose points of view are more susceptible to persuasion			1
@entity103 , spokesman for @entity46 , said advertising on @entity3 is part of a broader effort to reintroduce the union to the general public			0
but , he added , ' it does n't hurt that an influential audience and electeds watch @entity3 [ too ]			2

data shows that influential political figures are increasingly watching sports
at the moment @entity3 holds a *virtual* monopoly on sports broadcasting
it is also a useful channel to get through to ' non-ideological ' voters
