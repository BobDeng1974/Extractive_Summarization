he remains a contracted @entity8 player and is not at this moment associated with the @entity7 side			2
in the @entity4 , it appears to have been viewed as a blow to the credibility of the @entity4 enterprise as the needs of @entity17 appear to have been placed above the growth of @entity7			0
@entity5 was unveiled as one of their signature marquee signings last summer but he may now not arrive until several months into the @entity11 campaign			2
it has provoked a furious reaction from a @entity7 independent supporters ' group , @entity51 , who have released the following statement : ' on behalf of the @entity51 , we would like to publicly denounce @entity56 ’s and @entity5 ’s decision to extend his loan to @entity8 until the end of the @entity23 season			1

' his exact starting date in @entity7 remains to be decided			0
on wednesday evening , @entity8 sources were not ruling out the possibility that @entity5 could yet return to @entity7 for the beginning of the @entity11 season in march or later on in @entity8 's season			1
for that to happen , the two clubs would have to agree a loan deal from @entity8 or a permanent transfer			0
it appears to be a possibility that remains open for discussion , although it seems most likely that @entity5 will remain in @entity17 as long as @entity29 believes he has a role to play at the club			0
a @entity7 statement said : ' his exact starting date with @entity68 will be confirmed as the @entity23 and @entity11 seasons unfold			1
