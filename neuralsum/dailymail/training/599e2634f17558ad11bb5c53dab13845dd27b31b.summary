@entity0 got the result they desperately needed against @entity2 but @entity3 and his coaching staff did not get the performance they desired			1
@entity6 will bring his wounded @entity7 to @entity8 next week for @entity0 's final game of the autumn international series and serious improvement is needed if @entity13 's troops are to take a prized southern hemisphere scalp in november			1
here , @entity15 looks at five things @entity0 learned from the match			0
@entity0 's forwards pack a punch @entity0 's attack may lack fluency and tempo , but their set piece remains one of the best in the world			1
@entity0 's lineout , bar a few late blips , operated beautifully again on saturday night with @entity29 hitting his targets with ease			1
@entity33 lock @entity32 continues to impress and did not take a backward step against the ultra-physical @entity2 forwards			0
the scrum remains a huge weapon for @entity0 going forward with young props @entity38 and @entity40 providing huge impact off the bench			2
@entity0 's scrum was once again outstanding and squeezed vital penalties out of the @entity2 pack @entity46 @entity47 was picked by @entity3 to give @entity0 more direction out wide and the @entity33 fly half certainly delivered a promising performance			1
@entity51 's wraparound with @entity52 created the space for @entity55 's opening try while his pin - point cross-kick allowed @entity57 to put @entity58 over in the right corner			0
@entity51 is made of tough stuff as well			0
the young number 10 copped several big hits including a huge tackle from @entity2 lock @entity64 early in the contest and bounced straight back up after @entity67 's thundering tackle in the second half			1
@entity47 impressed for @entity0 against the @entity2 in difficult conditions at @entity8 @entity0 's midfield is still a central issue @entity52 and @entity71 were solid but unspectacular against @entity2			1
granted , conditions were difficult and the @entity2 put in a monstrous defensive effort but @entity13 still has major issues in midfield			2
@entity52 had an indifferent night and was substituted for @entity76 in the 64th minute			0
@entity71 could be @entity0 's answer at inside centre but does not have the acceleration or creativity to make inroads in the outside channels			2
@entity83 remains @entity0 's premier attacking three - quarter and there is no doubt that @entity13 will be keeping an eye on @entity90 's progress following his recent return from injury			1
@entity52 had a tough night at the office against a fired - up @entity2 defence @entity95 is still @entity0 's main man @entity95 has come in for some staunch criticism in recent weeks			1
the @entity99 skipper has often been pilloried for his breakdown skills and ball carrying impact			0
many feel @entity95 is not in the same league as out and out ' fetchers ' such as @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 in terms of the dark arts of openside play			0
against a powerful @entity2 backrow , @entity95 excelled and rightfully took home the @entity115 award			0
the @entity0 skipper also topped the tackle charts with 21 hits and outshone his fellow backrowers @entity120 and @entity121			0
@entity0 skipper @entity95 had a superb game on a difficult night for his team england have the pack and half - backs to beat australia @entity0 can round off a disappointing november series and defeat the @entity7 next saturday but only if @entity3 goes back to basics			2
@entity0 have admirably sought to evolve their game in the last 12 months but if @entity13 's side implement their ' all - court ' game against @entity7 , they will be ripped to shreds			2
the @entity7 caused @entity133 all sorts of problems when they injected tempo into their play and have an arsenal of outside backs who can hurt @entity0			0
if @entity0 keep it tight , pick @entity51 and @entity142 at half - back and play the percentages , they can strangle the @entity7 at @entity8			1
@entity0 have the forward muscle and the set - piece to strangle a suspect @entity7 pack next saturday			0

@entity0 *laboured* to a *28* - 9 *victory* over @entity2 at @entity8
@entity47 impressed at fly half
@entity0 's midfield selection remains a big issue
