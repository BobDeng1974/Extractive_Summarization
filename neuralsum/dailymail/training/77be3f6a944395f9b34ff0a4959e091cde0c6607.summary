she was today still getting over a hangover in a @entity25 veterinary surgery , but her owner , miss @entity26 was delighted that her four - legged friend was on the road to recovery			0
@entity5 fell gravely ill after licking deadly radiator fluid ethylene glycol off spare car parts in a garage			1
within half an hour she was swaying , rejecting food and at serious risk of death from kidney failure			0
miss @entity26 , from the @entity25 suburb of @entity38 , rushed @entity5 , a @entity40 present , to the vet , who realised the dog was just a few hours away from total renal failure			1
by chance , the vet had a bottle of vodka , which was also a @entity40 gift , handy and @entity5 was immediately hooked up to the liquor , @entity25 ’s @entity46 newspaper reported			1
‘ the next time i saw her ( the vet ) i asked if she was wasted – drunk – and the vet was like “ yeah ! ” , ’ said 27 - year - old miss @entity26			2
‘ @entity5 had really bloodshot eyes and she was pretty unsteady			0
she could n’t move around much because she was so wasted			0
’ her wobbly condition was not surprising - she had been given vodka every six hours for two days through a tube in her nose			2
in less than 72 hours she had consumed almost a bottle and a half			1
an @entity3 , like @entity5 : although the puppy was left unsteady on her feet and with bloodshot eyes , the treatment successfully halted the chemical reaction that would have led to renal failure vet dr @entity70 said the ‘ @entity72 ’ treatment was rare but effective			1
‘ the alcohol stops a chemical reaction in the body , ’ dr @entity70 said			0
‘ without the vodka @entity5 was likely to develop renal failure			2
’ miss @entity26 said the pup had just about beaten her hangover the same way that humans do – trying to ignore it			0
‘ she slept a lot and she was eating a lot , but she seems really happy now , ’ said miss @entity26 .			0
