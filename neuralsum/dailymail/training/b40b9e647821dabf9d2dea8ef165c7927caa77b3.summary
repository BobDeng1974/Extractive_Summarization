by @entity1 reporter on the surface , it almost looks as though someone has installed a hot tub in the middle of a lake - bubbling jets of water breaking the otherwise perfectly calm waters of the @entity10			1
but these are n't bubbles , and , far from someone having added a touch of spa luxury to the @entity18 stretch of water , this perfectly spherical disturbance in the water is made of ice			1
the incredible spinning circle of ice , which was spotted by @entity22 while out hunting with relatives , is entirely natural albeit extremely rare			2
the 73 - year - old said : ' at first i thought , no way ! it was surreal			0
you looked at it and you thought , how did it do that ? ' he calculated the disk 's diameter to be about 55 feet , took photos and videos of it and then turned to the internet for more information about what he , his brother - in - law and nephew had seen			1
' it 's not an unknown phenomenon , but it is relatively rare , ' said @entity22 , who lives in rural @entity59 , about 20 miles west of @entity60			1
@entity61 , a @entity63 hydrologist in @entity64 , and @entity65 , a weather service meteorologist in @entity66 , said a combination of cold , dense air last weekend and an eddy in the river likely caused the disk			1
' it 's actually quite beautiful , ' @entity61 said			0
' it 's not a continuous sheet of ice , ' explains @entity63 hydrologist for @entity64 , @entity61 the cold , dense air — the air pressure saturday in nearby @entity60 was a record high for the city for the month of november , according to @entity65 — turned the river water into ice , but since the water was relatively warm it did n't happen all at once			1
floating bits of ice got caught in the eddy and started to spin in a circle			1
' it 's not a continuous sheet of ice , ' @entity61 said			2
' if you were to throw a grapefruit - size rock on it , it would go through			0
' it 's not a solid piece of ice — it 's a collection of ice cubes			2
' @entity22 said the spinning disk had frozen up but was still visible in the river			0
the phenomenon is not unknown in the @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 , but pretty rare elsewhere			0
normally they are thought to occur at bends in the river where the accelerating water creates a force called ' rotational shear ' , which breaks off a chunk of ice and twists it around			2
as the disc rotates , it grinds against surrounding ice - smoothing into a perfect circle			2
@entity18 locals who have been admiring the ice circle are wondering how long it will last			1
the @entity10 freezes over each winter mr @entity22 said : ' i 'm not sure how long it was there ( spinning ) , ' he said			0
' it had to be quite a long time			0
' if you look at the picture , you can see growth rings on the disk			0
' mr @entity61 said he was surprised by the size of the ice circle , which he said would be more likely on a larger river such as the @entity132			1
' that might be one of the better examples i 've seen , ' he said			0
' it 's a pretty cool one			0

a naturally - occurring phenomenon has developed in @entity18 's @entity10 , which feeds into the @entity139 north of @entity60
experts say record - high air pressures at the weekend *quickly* froze parts of the warm river water
parts of the ice were picked up by an eddy and started to spin , picking up more pieces
the end result was an ice circle *measuring* over 50 feet wide that has *fascinated* locals
