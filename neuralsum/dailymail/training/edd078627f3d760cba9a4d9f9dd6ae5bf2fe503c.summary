forget the @entity1 , across the @entity2 , it is our pets attempting to ruin @entity5			1
your cat or dog might be the most adorable and innocent creature in the world , but when the festive season comes around , it seems they suddenly become wild and unstoppable destroyers			0
the house , with all of its @entity5 decorations and especially your tree , becomes their terrible playground - as this hilarious collection of photos show			2
along with decorations strewn over the floor , trees lying on the ground and presents ripped open , the pets have gone to town on their owner 's attempts to make their homes look festive			1
but their post-destruction big doe - eyed looks of love make it hard to stay mad for too long			0
' i know this looks bad , but it was the cat ' : the custom of bringing a tree indoors is too much for some pets the ultimate dog shaming : this pooch dutifully accepts his punishment for helping open everyone 's presents ' oh hi , you 're home early ... ' : this moggy is merely assisting with the enormous amount of food to be eaten ' i just thought i 'd help you open the cards ' : one dog looks shameful after destroying its owner 's lounge ' do n't ask			2
but yes , i could use some help ' : one cat manage to get himself in a rather precarious situation ' just wait until they see my surprise ' : a feline makes a valiant attempt to become the star atop a tree ' and what ? ' : some pets are totally unapologetic about the havoc they wreak on our @entity5 plans ' this new game is fun ! ' : the higher the decoration , the more points this dog apparently thinks he gets			0
