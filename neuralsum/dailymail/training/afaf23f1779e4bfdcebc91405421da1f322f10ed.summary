a new baby boom of @entity2 , @entity3 and black children is coming to @entity4 - and it will make whites a minority by 2050			1
the surge is not due to new immigrants coming to the @entity4 - but instead stems from the immigrants who are already here having children , according to @entity12 demographer @entity11			1
his new book , @entity14 , recounts how falling white birth rates and rising birth rates for minorities will change way the @entity4 looks - and votes - forever			1
baby boom : by 2050 , minorities will outnumber whites - thanks to shrinking birth rates for white families and growing birth rates non-whites go east , young man : @entity27 are moving rapidly from the southwest and @entity29 eastward and through the @entity30 ( green dots ) diverse @entity32 : the @entity32 , @entity33 and southeastern @entity4 have all also see a large increase in the @entity3 population integration by marriage : biracial families will become dramatically more as more and more people find love outside their own races			1
fifteen percent of all new marriages are multiracial there are already nearly as many non-white babies being born as white children , according to @entity47 statistics			2
it 's only a matter of time before minorities children outnumber white ones			1
the result , @entity11 tells the @entity52 , will be very similar to the @entity53 after the @entity54 - except this time it will be minority children being born			0
' back in the 1950s , we had a lot of @entity4 across the board in their childbearing years - we had all these babies , ' he said			1
' now , that 's really only the case for some of the newer minorities			0
' and it 's not just cities that will be changing			0
the suburbs are already becoming more diverse and are likely to become progressively less white year after year			2
between 2000 and 2010 , the population of @entity27 in suburbs grew by more than eight million			0
major cities added just three million hispanics			0
even among black @entity4 , the population of suburban dwellers is growing			2
in the last decade , the population of suburban blacks grew by three million and the population of urban blacks shrank by several hundred thousand			0
mixed race : in the next 40 years , the number of mixed race @entity4 will nearly triple , the number of @entity81 will double and the number of whites will decline by six percent hispanics , blacks and @entity81 are all moving to the suburbs in greater numbers than whites the influx of blacks to suburbs is also cutting the segregation in @entity4 as neighborhoods outside the city core become more diverse suburban sprawl : the number of blacks moving to suburbs has skyrocketed			1
@entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 , are the top cities where black @entity4 leaving city centers headed back @entity30 : two generations after black families fled segregation and poverty in the @entity30 , they are beginning to move back			0
the population of blacks in @entity101 has grown dramatically in recent decades			0

white birth rates are falling while immigrants and other minorities are having more children
the population surge comes from immigrants having children in the @entity4 - not directly from immigration
minorities are also moving to the suburbs at *faster* rates , ensuring they are getting more diverse
the population of mixed race @entity4 will grow dramatically in the next 50 years - nearly tripling
