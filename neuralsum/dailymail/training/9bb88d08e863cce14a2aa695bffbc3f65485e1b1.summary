@entity0 are refusing to give up in their attempts to prise @entity3 defender @entity2 away from @entity4 , despite the @entity7 club 's reluctance to part with the player			1
@entity2 is a 20 - year - old central defender who is among the most highly rated young talents in world football			0
he has enjoyed two impressive seasons for @entity4 since signing for the club in the summer of 2013 in a deal that is thought to have approached £ 30m when he was only 19 years of age			1
@entity0 are believed to have made enquiries in the january transfer window but were knocked back in no uncertain terms by the @entity19			0
@entity4 defender @entity2 remains a target for @entity0 @entity0 are looking to bolster their defence this summer			1
@entity23 is a leading target at right back , while they will also seek to recruit two centre - halves of elite standing			0
@entity2 is believed to be one of those being closely monitored by @entity29			0
@entity4 view him as a long - term mainstay of their defence and the @entity7 club do not wish to sell the 20 - year - old @entity3 but they are aware of growing and sustained interest from @entity33			2
@entity4 are also conscious that despite @entity2 being @entity3 , he has a @entity35 passport , meaning that he does not take up a @entity37 place in their squad			2
this only increases the player 's value to the club as only four @entity37 citizens are permitted in a squad in @entity45			0
if @entity0 wish to bring @entity4 to the negotiating table , it will require an offer that usurps the £ 30m that they paid for @entity50 in 2002 and the £ 40m that @entity51 are reported to have shelled out for @entity52 last summer			1
even a @entity54 record fee for a defender , however , may not be enough to persuade @entity4 to sell , with the club so far resolute in their determination to brush off @entity0 's interest			2
@entity2 takes on @entity59 during @entity4 's @entity61 game with @entity62 @entity2 ' agent has gone public in recent weeks to state that the defender is target for several of @entity67 's leading clubs , including @entity0 , but that could also be a ploy to force @entity4 into offering improved terms to the player			1
reports in @entity7 suggest those talks are continuing with the @entity7 club			0
sources close to @entity4 have told @entity76 that @entity2 is happy to remain at the club , while many who work around the club have been impressed by his skill , attitude and dedication			2
after only a few months at the club , @entity2 was already conducting mixed zone interviews in @entity7 and he recently described @entity4 coach @entity85 as ' the best coach a young defender could wish to have			1
' @entity2 ( right ) celebrates with @entity88 ( centre ) and @entity90 however , @entity4 wish to strengthen significantly this summer and the demands of @entity92 may force them to move players out in order to bring in recruitments			2
there is increasing speculation that @entity98 and @entity99 could be among the contenders but a @entity102 - style bid for @entity2 could force the @entity7 club to think long and hard			0
the extraordinary television rights deal in @entity105 has also not gone unnoticed by senior figures in @entity7			0
while @entity109 clubs will tap into a £ 5billion jackpot from 2016 , the @entity45 rights deal is worth only £ 538m to @entity7 clubs per season , compared to the £ 1.7b that @entity109 clubs will rake in from @entity114 and @entity115			0
@entity2 tries to take the ball off @entity62 's @entity117 during the @entity61 game it only strengthens the position of @entity0 , @entity51 and @entity62 in the transfer market while placing a squeeze on @entity4 , who also have to cope with higher tax demands in @entity7			1
there is a growing fear that it could further fuel the competitive imbalance in the @entity35 transfer market			0
@entity2 , for his part , has played a significant role in the @entity4 backline this season but he has often been forced to deputise at right full - back , rather than in his favoured central defensive position			1
intriguingly , many regular observers of this @entity4 outfit discern that @entity2 is already a more accomplished centre - back than @entity102 and @entity88 .			1

@entity0 will have to offer more than £ 30m for @entity2
@entity4 are keen to keep hold of the @entity142 *international*
@entity2 preferred position is centre back but has played at right back
