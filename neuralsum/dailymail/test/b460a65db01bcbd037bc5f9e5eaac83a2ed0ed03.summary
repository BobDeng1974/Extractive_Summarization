one of the most widespread ' food rules ' passed down from generation to generation may actually be a myth			2
the five - second rule , which has been cited to justify picking up everything from a salt and vinegar chip to an assortment of cold cuts , is not as sure - fire as many snackers would surely like it to be			2
experts have largely dismissed the almost magical powers surrounding the five - second rule , but said what type of food and where you drop it does come into play			1
' it 's a myth ; we definitely do not recommend it			2
' however , ms @entity23 said we need to consider the type of food before picking something up off the floor and eating it			0
' it all comes down to bacteria , ' she said			0
video courtesy of @entity39 experts say dry foods , like cookies , are less hazardous and can be ok , according to health experts uncut fruit is one group considered non-hazardous , however cut fruits should never be subjected to the five - second rule ' @entity48 relies on moisture to grow , so any food wet food is considering potentially hazardous			1
it 's much easier for bacteria to grow on those foods			0
' with dry foods , it is conversely much tougher for bacteria to grow			0
' dry foods are things such as potato chips , lollies , nuts , biscuits , crackers and uncooked rice or pasta			1
potato chips and nuts fall into the ' maybe ' area of the five - second rule meat , such as cold - cuts and salami , are definitely not worth the risk , and can be a breeding ground for bacteria if you drop some uncooked rice , it can be safe to pick it up and throw in the pan			1
however , cooked rice is very dangerous dry foods are things such as potato chips , lollies , nuts , biscuits , crackers and uncooked rice or pasta			1
@entity91 foods are cut fruit , cold meats , ham , salami , dairy products , and cooked rice or pasta			1
the comments come after the @entity24 released a food safety report card as part of @entity102 on april 7			2
crakers and nuts have a lower risk than wet foods sausages should never be picked up - five - second rule or not more than 4.1 million cases of food poisoning are diagnosed in @entity110 every year , with 31,920 hospitalisations and 82 deaths			1
however , the number is coming down , which experts credited to an increased basic understanding of food safety			0
‘ @entity110 consumers get an a plus for knowledge ... ' , food safety information council chair professor @entity117 said			0
‘ but there are a number of other food safety practices where there can be ‘ room for improvement			0
' mr @entity117 identified cooking food thoroughly , being aware of and sticking to use - by dates , and ensuring it is stored at the right temperature as important areas of focus .			0

five - second rule *dubbed* a myth by food health *industry* experts
' we definitely do not recommend it , ' @entity24 says
however , what food you drop and where you drop it has an impact on risk
potato chips , nuts and biscuits less risky , but meats and cut fruit a no - go
