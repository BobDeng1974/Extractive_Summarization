@entity0 has taken a swipe at @entity3 colleagues , media commentators and her old sparring partner @entity5 in her first interview since leaving politics			1
@entity9 's @entity8 has told @entity11 's ' @entity10 ' this morning that he came away from the three hour sit - down conversation with the former prime minister , thinking that mr @entity14 was ' pretty treacherous '			1
' there are a dozen books out at the moment , all of which i read in advance of this thing and all about that period of time , that dysfunctional @entity14 , ' @entity8 said			1
@entity0 admits to @entity8 that her ' real @entity0 ' comment was ' my fault you know sort of dumb , dumb error , rookie error maybe			1
i mean i was n’t a rookie in politics , i was a rookie at being prime minister ' ' it 's extraordinary , they covered him up for awful long time and it 's not just her but they all say the same thing			1
' the veteran journalist was asked whether the real @entity14 was hidden from the @entity47 public			2
' right to the point where she suggests that , at the end , she says she had no choice but to get rid of him , ' he said			0
happier times between @entity0 and @entity14 but her interviewer told @entity11 that ' they all knew how dysfunctional he was and they 'd been covering him up ' on the night she told @entity14 she would challenge him for the leadership : the way i tell it in the book is my side of it … you know … a very emotional time , if anything the accusations against me in politics and you still read in the newspapers you know the woman who wielded the knife , if anything the reputation i have from that night is one of political brutality			1
actually in the moment i was hesitant , a conversation went too long , i certainly fed ( @entity14 ) hope			2
i should n’t have done that			0
on @entity14 after she had deposed him : i thought his reaction would be one of hurt and acute distress			1
i know a lot now about what it feels like to lose the prime ministership , so i expected him to feel very , very battered and bruised			2
obviously i was wrong about that			0
on her decision to campaign as the ' real ' @entity0 : i put my hand up for that one hundred per cent			2
that ’s my fault you know sort of dumb , dumb error , rookie error maybe			0
i mean i was n’t a rookie in politics , i was a rookie at being prime minister			1
on the ' odd couple ' - her relationship with @entity104 : you look at all of that and you say , how much of that is gender working , because would we think it was quite so odd if a male prime minister or a male chief executive officer of a big bank or whatever had a wife who worked as a hairdresser ? would we think that was kind of you know really , really odd ? why on earth did he marry her ? she ’s a hairdresser ! i just do n’t think it would occur to us			1
i think it was the gender thing a bit			0
but in terms of you know being supportive , @entity104 was there and , yes , there ’s the blow - drying of the hair , but there ’s so much more			0
on why she has n’t married @entity104 : it ’s just the right decision for us and the right decision for me			0
we ’ve just been joking about it , the various descriptors you can put on my forehead , i am an atheist , i ’m not a person of faith , and so i do n’t think about marriage in that religious sense			0
and i do n’t feel that we need you know some ceremony or anything to you know make our relationship meaningful ; it is meaningful			0
so it ’s the right choice for us			0
on life at @entity153 and @entity154 : i ’d had no life experience that prepared me for having ah staff around you in that close , intimate sense that staff in @entity153 or @entity154 are			0
and i thought there ’s only a couple of ways of reacting to this			0
you could pretend you were poncing around in @entity166 or something like that ! or you could just try and embrace it and make it an extended kind of family circumstance			0
on same sex marriage : i ’ve got what may be in the modern age a kind of old - fashioned , feminist view about can we , take the traditional institution of marriage and stretch it ? or do you create some other way of solemnising relationships and recognising them as of worth and status			0
and when i was a young feminist i would ’ve said overwhelming the gay community was on that track too , but things have changed ! i accept the course of human history now is that ah we are going to see same sex marriage here and in you know most parts of the developed world			0
' they all knew how dysfunctional he was and they 'd been covering him up			0
' certainly she ( @entity0 ) thinks he was heading for an emotional breakdown			1
' ' the way i tell it in the book is my side of it … you know … a very emotional time , if anything the accusations against me in politics and you still read in the newspapers you know the woman who wielded the knife , if anything the reputation i have from that night is one of political brutality , ' ms @entity0 said			1
' actually in the moment i was hesitant , a conversation went too long , i certainly fed ( @entity14 ) hope			2
i should n’t have done that			0
' i thought his reaction would be one of hurt and acute distress			0
i know a lot now about what it feels like to lose the prime ministership , so i expected him to feel very , very battered and bruised			0
obviously i was wrong about that			0
' @entity8 revealed that @entity14 was not the only @entity235 connection or high - profile person targeted by the ex-labor leader			1
' she unloads on the @entity239 , she says that 's one of the things she does n't miss , almost without exception , ' he said			2
' @entity244 gets a fair thumping , in there for probably in her mind with good reason			2
' not all the brickbats are reserved for others			0
@entity0 accepted full responsibility for her ' real @entity0 ' claim , putting it down as a rookie mistake			1
she admits to @entity8 that ' i put my hand up for that one hundred per cent			2
that ’s my fault you know sort of dumb , dumb error , rookie error maybe			0
i mean i was n’t a rookie in politics , i was a rookie at being prime minister '			1
but it 's the revelations about then foreign minister @entity267 which have raised eyebrows			1
' @entity267 as well , she says there was a mistake to a point , @entity267 , that in fact when he got there he was lazy , ' he added			1
' i 'm sure he 's got a different opinion			0
' but mr @entity267 has rejected the accusations that he was lazy			1
he told the @entity277 today that ' i think she 's saying this because i clearly disappointed her by switching to @entity14 but as i said in my diaries i did so for one reason it was the very viability of the party we love '			1
mr @entity267 , who recently released his own diary - based account of the tumultuous time which dripped the then @entity288 , stated that ' the great value of a diary is that it presents the daily reality of life and that 's what my diary does , it demonstrates that i was totally engaged in a tough and demanding job '			2
@entity8 pointed out that the ex-pm was warm during the interview and that she did not just focus internally , delivering some strong words on the current prime minister			1
' she 's fairly savage on @entity5 , as well , ' he added			2
the former @entity47 prime minister was recently called to give evidence at the @entity303 into @entity304			1
during four hours of testimony , ms @entity0 denied having any knowledge of an illegal ' slush fund ' and having any role in setting up an account for the @entity311			2
while in the witness box ms @entity0 admitted that she may have done some things differently but added that ' none of us get to go in a time machine and go backwards '			2
the former prime minister takes a swipe at radio broadcaster @entity244 during the interview with veteran tv journalist @entity8 @entity0 now says that appointing @entity267 as foreign minister was a ' mistake ' and describes him as ' lazy '			1
he has countered with ' i think she 's saying this because i clearly disappointed her by switching to @entity14 ' @entity5 does not escape the wrath of @entity0 in her sit - down interview with @entity8 ' it 's extraordinary , they covered him up for awful long time and it 's not just her but they all say the same thing ' according to interviewer @entity8 @entity8 interviewed the former prime minister ahead of her book release			1
up until today , much of the detail in the book had been kept a closely guarded secret			0
