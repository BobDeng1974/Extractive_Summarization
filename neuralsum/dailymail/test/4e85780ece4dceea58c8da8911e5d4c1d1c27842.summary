this eighteen - month - old boy pulled a rice - cooker brimming with boiling water down on his head , burning deep scars into his face and leaving him almost blind			1
as a crack team of surgeons from the @entity10 charity , @entity9 , worked last march to save the sight of little baby @entity12 , from @entity14 , @entity15 , inspirational burns survivor @entity16 watched on			1
@entity16 was deeply moved by the plight of the baby with big , brown eyes			2
that 's because she knows that if she lived in a country like @entity12 's , she would n't be here			1
foreign doctors would n't have been able to save her from the flames that nearly killed her by lashing 64 per cent of her body with burns in 2011			2
' i would n't have survived , ' she said during a candid interview ahead of hosting a fundraising gala on thursday which aims to raise funds for more volunteer medicos to head overseas to save lives and livelihoods			1
' if i was from @entity15 or @entity36 , no ifs or buts , 100 per cent i would have died			2
@entity16 witnessed the operation @entity12 's sight was saved by keen doctor volunteers from @entity9			1
@entity16 told @entity12 was ' for sure ' one of her inspirations in working for @entity9 fitter and stronger than ever : @entity16 's recovery from the horrific burns that left her clinging to life is inspirational			1
she recently ran a half - marathon and beat the time she ran before the 2011 @entity44 blaze @entity16 , who has been operated on more than 200 times since she was caught in the flames , believes @entity10 take their medical system for granted			1
her remarkable recovery is a case - in - point			2
few would have thought she would be more athletic now than she was before she was seared with burns while running the @entity44 ultra-marathon three - and - a - half - years ago			1
' i 'm fitter now than i was before ! ' @entity16 told @entity12			1
nervous about medical complications , @entity16 was ' dumbfounded ' when she ran a half - marathon last month at a quicker pace ( 1hr 45mins ) than her time before she was burned ( 1hr 50mins )			1
the only difference was that she needed to douse herself in water every 5km , as her skin has lost the ability to keep her temperature stable			0
powered by a fierce determination to prove herself , @entity16 is fitter than ever , embarking on a ferocious fitness program in a bid to compete in the 2016 @entity82			1
the six - day - a - week program features three major planks , working on the burns victim 's already impressive cardio fitness , strength and flexibility			1
if it sounds daunting , never fear - even @entity16 admits she struggles with staying motivated sometimes			1
' all of us make excuses , do n't we ? i think it 's a normal thing to do ... i think it 's part of being human			0
' the program @entity96 : 2 x 2.5k swims per week and she runs around 30kms a week strength : 2 personal training sessions per week , involving conditioning exercises including box - jumps and squats flexibility : 2 yoga sessions each week , ' just to get a good stretch ' ' maybe i 've got something to prove ... i think i am more motivated ' asked about what motivates her to keep so fit , she told @entity12 there are bigger obstacles in life than running a marathon			1
' maybe i 've got something to prove ...			0
i think i am more motivated , ' she said , revealing her intense , six - day - a - week training regimen			0
she is hoping to compete in the 2016 @entity82			0
' compared to what i 've been through , things like doing a marathon are rather minor by comparison			0
' there were many dark moments during her recovery , she said - ones that required her to draw upon not only her own strength , but that of others			0
@entity16 experienced many dark moments during her recovery that required her to draw upon not only her own strength , but others as well her partner @entity131 ( left , pictured during a hike recently ) has been @entity133 's most steadfast supporter throughout the entire ordeal on thursday , @entity133 will hold a gala to raise funds for the same charity that saved @entity47 's sight , @entity9			1
she will also provide an update on how @entity12 is progressing ' there were terrible moments when i just wanted to give up , ' she said			2
not self - conscious : @entity16 has always taken pride in her appearance only recently she had a scare on the operating table when she stopped breathing while surgeons were attempting to install her new nose , terrifying her partner , @entity131 , and mother @entity150 , who been by her side throughout the entire journey			2
' i guess i was really blessed because i was surrounded by a really good support team , my partner ( @entity142 ) , my family , my friends , the doctors , the nurses , even my local community of @entity159			0
' in those really hard times i did draw strength from the people around me '			0
given the nature of her work with @entity9 , appearance was another topic @entity16 dwelled upon while talking to @entity12			1
she said she has always taken pride in her appearance , which has n't changed			0
the burns do n't concern her - instead , they are something she is accustomed to			2
' let 's say you 're at a party and you 're self conscious and you think your arse looks big , ' @entity16 said			2
' every time someone looks at you , you going to think , " they 're thinking my arse looks big "			0
' but if you are n't really thinking that at all , you wo n't see it			0
' i 'm not looking for people who are looking at me			0
' but then , if i was really self - conscious , i 'd probably notice it a lot more - because i 'm sure there are people who do look at me			0
' years after the disaster , life is something close to normal now for @entity16 , who lives life according to a simple creed			2
' all i do is wake up and try and get the most out of each day , ' she said			0
' and that 's kind of what i 've always done			0
' as for @entity47 , it is understood his big , brown eyes can see again - perhaps allowing him to live a life with the same clarity of purpose as @entity133			0
' all i do is wake up and try and get the most out of each day , ' @entity16 told @entity12			1
that is the simple creed by which she lives her life			0
