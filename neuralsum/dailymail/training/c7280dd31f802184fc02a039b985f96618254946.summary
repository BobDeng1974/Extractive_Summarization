by @entity0 published : 15:26 est , 30 september 2013 updated : 15:41 est , 30 september 2013 farewell ? : reports say that @entity2 will not renew his contract at @entity4 the chatter surrounding @entity2 ’s contract negotiations with parent company , @entity7 , intensified on monday with solid reports that he is poised to leave the helm of @entity4			1
@entity10 is reporting that @entity2 is unlikely to renew his contract as creative director of @entity4			1
the move would allow him to focus his energies on his namesake labels			2
their article corroborates similar reports published by @entity19 last week			2
it also substantiates longstanding rumors that former @entity23 designer @entity22 could succeed @entity2 at @entity4 ’s helm			1
@entity2 -- whose signature brand @entity2 and diffusion label @entity2 are also owned by @entity7 -- could be leaving @entity4 in order to take his personal businesses ‘ to the next level , ’ writes the paper which might mean , according to sources , that @entity2 could be eying an initial public offering — placing him in the footsteps of his design contemporary @entity36 , whose business , following a 2011 ipo , now holds an approximate $ 15 billion market value			1
@entity2 ’s retail sales are now reportedly estimated in the billions			1
in the last sixteen years , @entity2 ( who joined @entity4 as creative director in 1997 -- the same time at which @entity7 purchased a majority stake in his own brand ) , has expanded the @entity4 brand from heritage luggage purveyor to a massive commercial entity			1
he was tasked with starting the brand ’s ready - to - wear business from scratch , as well as growing the label ’s overall commercial popularity and cool quotient			0
@entity2 ’s ten - year contract at @entity4 will reportedly end in the next few months			1
fashion insiders expected the designer ’s spring 2014 runway show , debuting on wednesday , to be his last for the brand			2
but that might not be the case			0
@entity10 writes that @entity2 ‘ could be tapped to do more @entity4 collections , including the fall show in march , ’ in lieu of signing another lengthy contract — giving the brand enough time to negotiate employment terms with his successor			1
reinventing the wheel : @entity2 's tenure at @entity4 is regarded for its collaborations with famous artists ( like @entity73 , above ) who reinvented the brand 's classic monogram however , they report that wednesday ’s show ‘ could involve retrospective or archival elements , ’ which could ‘ provide a glance back at a fruitful collaboration that helped catapult @entity4 ’s — and @entity2 ’ — global profile			1
’ further reinforcing the fashion rumor mill , it is also being reported that @entity22 is indeed the front runner to replace @entity2 at @entity4			1
@entity86 ’s potential appointment would follow a 15 - year run as the lead designer at @entity23 — a tenure that abruptly ended last year			0
if appointed at @entity4 , @entity86 would have some big shoes to fill			0
in the last sixteen years , @entity2 steered the @entity4 brand through a variety of successful phases , the most fruitful of which was the brand ’s obvious foothold in the ‘ logo - mania ’ trend of the early aughts			1
through collaborations with contemporary artists like @entity102 and @entity103 , @entity2 was able to reinvent the classic @entity4 monogram for a new , commercial audience			2
the artists ’ colorful interpretations of @entity4 ’s historic dna earned the label a strong following in brand - conscious luxury markets like @entity112 and @entity113			0
both countries have accounted for a large portion of @entity4 ’s global financial success			0
extra credit : @entity2 is credited with starting @entity4 's ready - to - wear collection , which he fashioned into a sophisticated , taste making label ( above , models walk the runway at the end of last season 's @entity4 show ) this past spring @entity2 sat down in conversation with @entity128 fashion influencer @entity126 as part of her discussion series at @entity134 ’s @entity133 venue			1
when prompted , he glossed over the rumors already surrounding his @entity4 contract negotiations , and said that leaving @entity4 would n’t be an entirely bad thing as it would provide him extra time to spend with his new dog			0
not that @entity2 ’s schedule would be completely unoccupied — he ’d still preside over the aforementioned @entity2 and @entity2 brands , which expanded earlier this year to include cosmetic offerings			2
@entity2 took the @entity4 responsibilities on at a time when designers ( including @entity146 and @entity147 ) were eager to spread their influence and financial capabilities with lofty creative director jobs			2
but that expanded influence also took a toll on many designers ’ time , patience , and sobriety			0
@entity147 recently explained in a @entity157 interview that the speed of the creative cycle at @entity160 , as well as his @entity147 line , was the primary reason for his spiral into alcohol and drug addiction			0
out of the box : @entity2 has brought a quirky , commercial edge to the @entity4 brand , which has incited a retail craze ( above , people walk by a @entity4 boutique under construction in @entity173 ) @entity2 , too , has been hospitalized for drug addiction			1
he was last admitted to rehab in 2007 , and has since adhered to a strict nutrition and exercise regimen to stay healthy			0
now , at 50 years old , may not be the worst time for him to get back to the basics			0
his longtime business partner @entity179 recently admitted in an interview that the duo had begun to let the creative responsibilities of their marc by @entity2 line slide , accounting for its waning retail prominence			1
@entity179 even said that the brand was ‘ getting a little stale			0
’ ‘ we just let it go			0
we rested on our laurels and it hurt us , ’ he said			0
in the spring , they appointed quirky @entity196 designers @entity194 and @entity197 to reengineer the label — a time at which @entity179 reasserted both he and @entity2 ’s dedication for the label			2
leaving @entity4 would allow them that focus .			0

retail sales for @entity2 's own labels are now estimated in the billions
