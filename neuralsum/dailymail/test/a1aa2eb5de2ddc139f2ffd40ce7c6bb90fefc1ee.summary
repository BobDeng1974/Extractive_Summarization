the petite @entity1 woman sitting by sir @entity2 presents herself initially as a typical grandmother			1
she is also co-chairman of @entity4 with @entity2			1
lady @entity5 is in her 70s with an endearing laugh and a royal blue scarf she has knitted especially for saturday 's @entity9 semi-final against @entity11 at @entity12			1
like 73 - year - old @entity2 , @entity13 is something of an eccentric			1
educated at @entity16 's @entity15 in the 1950s , she has been a singer and composer who wrote the theme song for the @entity19			1
' it was called @entity21 , ' she says proudly before talking enthusiastically about her involvement with the @entity23 and her autobiography , a @entity25			2
@entity4 co-owners @entity27 and sir @entity2 spoke to @entity29 's @entity28 the @entity31 club will swap the @entity32 for @entity12 on saturday in the @entity9 semi-final but then she offers a chilling insight into what it is to be one of @entity1 's most powerful women , a super-rich @entity40 graduate who became the first female on the @entity43 board			1
@entity2 listens intently as the woman he credits with rescuing @entity4 last september talks about the night in 2014 when three men armed with @entity48 automatic weapons fired on her house in north - east @entity1			1
she believes the incident was provoked by the political activities of her daughter and son - in - law			2
the previous day they had instigated a peaceful public demonstration after seeing the former wife of @entity57 — @entity58 prime minister and one - time owner of @entity60 — in a @entity62 shopping mall			2
@entity57 was removed from power in 2006 in a military coup after allegations of corruption			2
@entity67 celebrates after scoring @entity4 's third goal against @entity69 to secure their victory @entity4 beat @entity69 3 - 0 in a quarter - final reply at the @entity73 to secure their @entity12 semi-final @entity13 says her daughter was still angry about the corruption , explaining : ' the next day i am with friends at my house			1
we had been playing cards until about 2am			2
we had just gone to bed			0
and i had 100 bullets from an @entity48 shot at my house			1
' they did n't mean to kill			0
they just wanted to scare , to threaten , but bullets hit my bathroom			2
the windows in my bedroom			0
' presumably she now goes everywhere under armed guard ? ' no , ' she says			0
' there 's no use having security			2
if someone really wants to kill me , they can kill me any time			0
it 's funny , when i realised it was a machine gun i thought it was the moment when i was about to die but i was very calm , not frightened at all			2
' ' this is one hell of a wise lady — and very modest too , ' says @entity2 admiringly			1
when i first saw @entity13 at the hotel at the @entity32 , she was seated at the head of a table having breakfast with five @entity1 gentlemen			1
one was @entity111 , who brokered the deal when @entity57 bought @entity60 in 2007 and is now senior adviser to the four - strong @entity1 consortium that purchased @entity4 last year			1
' in business i 'm probably more comfortable with men			0
i find them more straight - forward , ' she explains now she is in the @entity120 that boasts a perfect view of the pitch			2
@entity4 players mob goalscorer @entity123 during their 3 - 0 @entity9 quarter - final win over @entity69 @entity29 's @entity126 gives the lowdown on @entity4 's players to watch ahead of the @entity11 match ' the people you saw me having breakfast with are involved in politics			1
and you may have recognised @entity111			0
he is a very nice man who has the knowledge and contacts we need			0
' as the owner of a 25 per cent stake in @entity4 , @entity13 is clearly not about to let @entity111 run the show , however			1
' i started in business when i was 25 , ' she says			0
' my late husband 's parents passed away and we had some money			2
we started with a school — which one of my daughters now runs — and then we had a hotel — but my biggest passion is land			0
i like to create things			0
it allows me to use my imagination			0
' she appears to be thinking along these lines with @entity4			1
the consortium has already invested heavily in the club 's academy , building 13 pitches			1
she says she is also in discussion with @entity163 and talks of a vision of ' a second @entity16 ' along the @entity166			0
' i love this town , ' she says			0
for @entity4 the longer - term vision is clear			1
a club that has twice before been promoted to the @entity170 want to return under manager @entity171			1
' that is the ambition , ' she says and @entity2 nods in agreement			1
@entity11 , pictured in training on friday , will provide a tough test for @entity171 's @entity4 on saturday @entity2 and @entity13 pose for a photo at the @entity32 during their chat with @entity29 @entity2 sees the @entity1 consortium as @entity4 's saviours , given the financial difficulties the club endured after selling to @entity183			1
the cash the @entity186 was expected to invest when he bought @entity4 in 2012 never materialised and after a period @entity2 described as the ' most stressful of my life ' , @entity13 and her colleagues stepped in			1
' they have been like a breath of fresh air			0
i ca n't tell you how excited i am about the future , ' he says			0
by his own admission @entity2 needed to sell			1
he did a remarkable job with his hometown club , building the stadium as well as overseeing their rise to the top flight for the first time			2
but reports have suggested he lost the best part of £ 300million between 2008 and 2014 and he does not deny it			0
' i 'm not sure it was quite that much , ' he says , ' but i lost a heck of a lot of dosh			0
' ' not on football ? ' @entity13 asks , a little nervously			1
' no , no , ' says @entity2 , with a laugh			1
' an entrepreneur 's life is cyclical			2
i 'm just pleased we can now look forward in a positive way			0
' reading man @entity215 battles with @entity217 's @entity216 in the @entity4 ' last game @entity13 and @entity2 are excited about saturday and have a long - term ambition to get to the top flight when it comes to saturday evening 's match , @entity4 's first @entity9 semi-final since 1927 , this pair of septuagenarians — possibly the oddest couple in sport — are giddy with excitement			1
@entity13 talks of the ' honour ' of playing @entity11 and the thrill of taking family , friends and business associates to @entity12			1
a man who has been defined by triumph over adversity , @entity2 loves the fact that his team are underdogs			1
in 12 previous attempts they have never beaten @entity11			0
@entity2 talks movingly about being in foster care after his mother was ostracised by her family for a wartime fling that led to his arrival			1
' being illegitimate was n't the most ennobling start , ' he says			0
' i feel sorry for my mother			0
she never really got over the fact of me			0
the pair are desperate to take their club back to the promised land of the @entity170 @entity4 boss @entity171 has a tough test to come through on saturday when his side face @entity11 at @entity12 ' i found out who my father was only 10 years ago			1
i never met him but his name was @entity262			0
quite ironic really when you think i became an " ads head " with the auto trader business			0
he was from @entity267 which is probably why i get on well with @entity268			0
' now @entity13 is the one listening intently			1
' i did n't know sir @entity2 's story until after we bought the club , ' she says , ' but he is a real gentleman			1
when my sons heard about me buying @entity4 they were all shocked			2
the first question they asked me was " where is your business model ? " ' i said there is n't one			0
i do n't think there can be in football			0
you just have to be passionate , dedicated and perhaps lucky			0
' everyone thinks i 'm crazy			0
everyone asks why ? why football ? why now ? but you have this team that wins and loses			0
it 's woken me up			2
made me feel more alert			0
' @entity2 gives her a squeeze			2
' and it 's fun , ' he says .			2

lady @entity5 and sir @entity2 are co-owners of @entity4
they are preparing to take the club to @entity12 on saturday night ; @entity4 's first @entity9 semi-final since 1927
@entity13 is something of an eccentric - she is a singer and composer who , in september , had ' 100 bullets from an @entity48 ' shot at her house
the pair have a long - term ambition to take @entity4 to the @entity170
