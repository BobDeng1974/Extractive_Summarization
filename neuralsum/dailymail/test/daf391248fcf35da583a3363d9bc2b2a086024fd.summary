@entity1 police who arrested a crew attempting to smuggle desperate migrants to @entity5 on a luxury yacht have estimated their illegal cargo was worth $ 800,000			1
police in @entity9 , a @entity10 port town , arrested three @entity12 men who were at the helm of the @entity15 - flagged yacht attempting to reach the @entity1 coast			1
it is thought the smugglers had charged each person $ 8,500 ( £ 5,700 ) to make the crossing , with police saying the total earned by the organisers was somewhere in the region of £ 536,000			2
however , the boat was far more seaworthy than some of the other vessels used , which can be anything from wooden fishing vessels to old cargo ships			0
yet even the yacht failed to make the journey in its entirety : the attempt was discovered when two merchant ships were called out to aid a boat in distress			2
selfies and other photos snapped by the @entity12 and @entity50 passengers helped police identify the smugglers , police said in a statement			1
police also revealed there were 23 children on bard the yacht			1
@entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 were all arrested for allegedly being part of the crew			2
@entity58 , one of the three @entity12 that were taken in custody by police for allegedly being part of the crew which was at the helm of the yacht @entity59 was also taken into custody after the yacht - filled with @entity12 and @entity50 migrants who paid $ 8,500 each for the journey - called for help as it approached the coast @entity60 was the third member of the alleged crew attempting to bring the migrants , including 23 children , to @entity5 the boat is the latest vessel to be stopped making the dangerous crossing from north @entity81 to @entity5 , packed with migrants desperate to start a new life			1
but many of the trips end in tragedy : so far this year , 1,776 have died , according to the @entity88 refugee agency , which estimates that 219,000 people made the crossing in 2014			0
on sunday alone , 900 men , women and children are believed to have died after their boat got into difficulty and overturned off @entity96 waters , south of the southern @entity1 island of @entity98			0
there were only 28 survivors			0
these infrared images show the rescue operation after migrant ship capsized on sunday survivors said they resorted to clinging to floating corpses until coastguards came to their rescue surviving immigrants who escaped the boat that capsized in the @entity32 killing up to 900 people appear deep in thought as they arrive in the @entity10 port city of @entity113 this morning doctor @entity114 , of the @entity115 , described the three hours he searched for the living among hundreds of dead floating corpses			1
he told the @entity118 : ' it was like a nightmare			0
there were bodies everywhere you looked			0
