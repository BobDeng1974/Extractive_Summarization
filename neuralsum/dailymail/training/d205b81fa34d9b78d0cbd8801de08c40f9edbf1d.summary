by @entity0 published : 09:33 est , 31 july 2013 updated : 21:59 est , 7 august 2013 the wife and daughter of a man who were found guilty of his murder and dubbed the ' lady killers ' have had their convictions quashed by the @entity8			1
@entity9 and @entity10 argued there was no evidence retired bookmaker , @entity13 , who was last seen in 2001 , was even dead and that he could be among the 2,000 people - a - year who disappear			1
three of the country ’s top judges today agreed with their lawyers that - with no body , no suggested mechanism of death and no indication even of the date when mr @entity13 was allegedly killed - his wife and daughter simply had ‘ no case to answer ’			1
@entity10 ( left ) and her mother @entity9 ( right ) argued there was no evidence the bookmaker was dead the jury ’s murder verdict was quashed and the women will not face a retrial			1
@entity9 , 65 , was last year found guilty by a jury at @entity37 ’s @entity36 of enlisting her 42 - year - old daughter ’s help to kill with mr @entity13 , 63 , and profit from his death			1
mr @entity13 , from @entity44 , in north - west @entity37 , who was reputed to be a heavy gambler and womaniser , had recently retired when he disappeared			2
after completing the contract for the sale of his home for £ 179,000 in may 2001 , he was never seen again			0
crown lawyers argued the mother and daughter had a financial motive and acted ' in concert ' to dispose of mr @entity13			1
never found : @entity13 disappeared more than a decade ago the jury found both women , who lived together in @entity57 , near @entity58 , guilty of murder by a 10 - 1 majority in april last year			1
the pair , who had earlier admitted fraud offences in relation to the plundering of mr @entity13 ’s £ 64,000 pension fund , were each jailed for life			2
however @entity68 , for @entity69 , told @entity37 ’s @entity70 it had not even been proved that mr @entity13 was dead			2
he said : ' the evidence proved that @entity13 disppeared over the week - end 12/13th may 2001			0
' @entity72 did not suggest when , where or how he was killed , who was present , the mechanism of death or what happened to the body			0
' he added : ' two hundred thousand people disappear each year and 2,000 of those are not heard from again			0
@entity13 could have been one of those 2,000			0
' overturning the women ’s murder convictions , @entity79 said : ' this was an alleged joint enterprise murder with no body , no suggested mechanism of death , no identified day when the murder was said to have occurred , no time and no place and no suggestion of what happened to the body			2
' @entity10 and @entity69 arriving for their murder trial at the @entity36 last year although mr @entity95 had accepted that the likelihood was that ' one or other ' of the women killed mr @entity13 , the judge said there was simply no evidence on which any rational jury could conclude that they had acted together to kill him			1
crown lawyers argued the woman had both the opportunity and motive for murder , but the judge emphasised : ' suspicion without more does not equate to proof '			1
one woman might have had trouble killing mr @entity13 single - handed and disposing of his body			0
but the judge , sitting with mr justice @entity114 , said : ' the courts regularly see proved allegations of homicide against a woman acting alone '			0
the judge ruled : ' the submission of no case to answer should have been allowed			0
these appeals will be allowed and both convictions will be quashed '			0
she added : ' for the most evident of reasons there could be no question of a retrial ' .			0

@entity9 and @entity10 were found guilty of murdering retired bookmaker @entity13
crown lawyers had argued the mother and daughter had a financial motive
three judges agreed today that with no body and no evidence of death they had no case to answer
jury ’s murder verdict was quashed and the women will not face a retrial
