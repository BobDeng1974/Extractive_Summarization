by @entity1 reporter published : 12:07 est , 30 july 2012 updated : 05:18 est , 31 july 2012 two binmen have been sacked after being caught on camera sleeping on the job - just a few hours into their shift			0
the pair were spotted catching 40 winks in their cab while out on their rounds in @entity11 , @entity12 , at 9.30am			1
the pictures , which were taken by a passing businessman visiting the area , show one @entity17 worker slumped at the driver seat with his hefty boots on the dashboard			1
caught on camera : the two binmen were spotted fast asleep at around 9.30am in the cab of their @entity17 refuse lorry by a passerby his co-worker is pictured in the passenger seat , eyes tightly closed and with his head resting against the back rest next to a half - open window			1
now the sleepy pair , who were employed by an outside agency , have now been told their services are no longer required			1
the photographer said : ‘ is this really what council employees get up to so early in the morning ? ’ the photos were taken at 9.30 in the morning , just three and a half hours into the average binman ’s shift			2
and the incident has caused added outrage because some local residents had been complaining their bins had gone uncollected			0
council bosses took swift action after they were sent the pictures			2
they identified the two as employed by an outside agency , but refused to disclose which agency the men worked for			1
sacked : @entity17 took swift action after these photos emerged , telling the two binmen their services were no longer required @entity60 , from campaign group @entity59 , said the workers found napping on the job should ‘ rightly face the sack ’			1
he said : ‘ @entity65 hand over their council tax so that their bins are emptied , not for staff to catch 40 winks in the cab			2
‘ the city council must demand value for taxpayers ’ money and transparency when they outsource a service			2
‘ firms who fail to provide staff that are up to scratch should be consigned to the rubbish heap just like the bins they were supposed to be collecting			0
’ two years ago the council controversially moved from a task and finish system where binmen could knock off if they completed their designated round early to one where they work a full daily shift			0
but now it appears that instead of knocking early some staff prefer to take their downtime in the middle of their shift			0
time wasters : the two binmen managed to fall asleep only a few hours into their shift at 9.30am the pair also attracted criticism from one city councillor , who said members of the public were ‘ paying the price for public sector cuts ’			1
@entity103 , @entity104 councillor for the @entity105 and @entity106 , said : ‘ i ’ve had calls from people in my ward to say their bins have n’t been collected , and even my own bins were collected a day late			0
‘ when you hear of people sleeping on the job , is makes you think is it any wonder we have a backlog			0
' they may have been sleeping because they had a busy shift , which shows that having agency staff instead of permanent staff is n’t the answer			0
’ a @entity17 spokesman said : ‘ the people photographed were agency workers and we have told the agency that their services are no longer required			1
we have made a complaint to them about this			0
