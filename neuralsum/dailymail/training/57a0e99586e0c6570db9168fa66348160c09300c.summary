at the end , @entity0 fell to his knees			1
for most of the five sets he played against @entity6 on friday night , the 11th seed looked like he was down on them and crawling home			1
it was ropey and inconsistent , rough and erratic			0
in short , it was not the graceful tennis typically associated with a player known as @entity0 and considered to be the ‘ best of the rest ’ in men ’s tennis			1
but he came through , scrapping for a 6 - 7 , 6 - 4 , 2 - 6 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 1 victory that carries him into the fourth round here for the first time			0
main man : @entity0 celebrates after defeating @entity6 in their singles match good game : @entity0 battled for five sets with @entity6 before emerging victorious the 23 - year - old had his share of luck along the way , at one stage drawing an animated flapping of the arms from @entity6 after his fourth favourable net cord in a matter of minutes			1
ultimately it was his superior nerve that made the difference , not to mention the fitness that has come since he linked up with coach @entity41 last october			0
he was out of sorts in the first set , which @entity6 took on a tiebreak , and continued to struggle to find his range as he levelled in the second			1
‘ @entity49 ’ , gifted but temperamental , took the third before @entity0 found his reserves of extra strength			1
he broke in the ninth game of the fourth and the @entity52 ’s spirit vanished , as the 25 - year - old coughed up three breaks in a 20 - minute fifth set			0
@entity0 said : ‘ @entity55 is a great competitor , especially on grass			1
he started pressuring me from the start with great serves			0
‘ i could n’t do much in the first set but i got my act together and in the end i was just too strong			0
‘ i have put in a lot of work and i knew nothing would go to waste			0
i knew that even though i was not at my level , i had the fuel			0
i am into the second week so let ’s see what happens			0
’ @entity69 , meanwhile , can finally have a day off			1
the no 14 seed played from monday through to friday because of two five - set matches suspended overnight for bad light and rain — so he could do with a breather			2
a 6 - 2 , 6 - 2 , 7 - 5 victory over qualifier @entity76 from @entity78 elicited his trademark twirl of celebration and permits him the opportunity of a weekend ’s rest			1
in action : @entity69 has played on every day of @entity84 so far he will probably need it , because up next comes @entity86 , the man who has done most to deprive @entity69 of a @entity88 title			1
their maiden meeting came in the @entity92 final of 2008 , when @entity86 broke his major duck			0
no sooner had @entity69 delighted @entity94 with his celebration dance after defeating @entity96 in the quarter - finals three years ago , than the @entity98 snuffed out his joy , winning their semi-final on route to the title			2
@entity69 has promised to dance again if he beats @entity86 on monday			2
but he is 29 - years - old , and even though cracks are appearing in the @entity106 ’s dominance , the chances for @entity69 to make that ultimate breakthrough are becoming slimmer			2
almost : @entity108 battled back from two sets down but fell to @entity110 in the fifth the @entity112 said he would draw on his victory over @entity96 here in 2011 , which required a comeback from two sets down			1
‘ i will use this whole match to remember in which mind i was and try to do the same , ’ he said			0
‘ of course , for me the goal will be to make my dance at the end			0
’ @entity108 looked like he might stage an overnight comeback from two sets down against 15th seed @entity110			1
the @entity122 saved two match points in the third - set tiebreak but ran out of steam in the decider			0
@entity110 will meet 23rd seed @entity127 today			2
elsewhere , 20th seed @entity129 beat 16th seed @entity131 in another five - setter , with the erratic @entity134 appearing to give up in the final set .			2

@entity0 defeated @entity6 in fives sets
@entity69 played his fifth day in a row to beat @entity76
@entity108 crashes out despite *brilliant* comeback agains @entity110
