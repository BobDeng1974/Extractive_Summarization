the @entity0 is investigating allegations that one of its presenters was involved in a ‘ vicious and unrelenting cyber-bullying campaign ’ that contributed to the death of a 47 - year - old man			1
@entity8 , who has been a @entity0 broadcaster for nearly 30 years , strongly denies making offensive comments on social networking sites about @entity11 , a computer software developer who died of a heart attack earlier this year			1
mr @entity8 is said to have posted messages on @entity16 and @entity17 suggesting mr @entity11 was a conman , siphoning off charity donations for his own use			1
reputation : @entity11 , left , appearing on tv to raise awareness of his charity and @entity26 presenter @entity8 the alleged abuse encouraged dozens of ‘ internet trolls ’ to join in the harassment , some allegedly claiming they were taking their cue from mr @entity8 because of his status as a @entity0 broadcaster			1
police have said they were not aware of any evidence mr @entity11 was misappropriating @entity37 father believes the alleged bullying hastened his son ’s death			0
and last night @entity41 discovered that the extent to which stress may have contributed to mr @entity11 ’s heart attack will be considered at the forthcoming inquest			0
in his spare time mr @entity11 ran a charitable foundation he set up in memory of his sister @entity48 , who committed suicide in 2009 while suffering from post-natal depression			0
before his death in june , he had begun libel proceedings against mr @entity8 and other people whose false allegations , he claimed , had destroyed his reputation and turned him into a recluse , unable to work and frightened to leave his house			1
a defence was lodged denying all the claims			2
however , his father , @entity60 , believes the alleged comments were posted by mr @entity8 and others and is demanding to know why @entity0 bosses apparently made no attempt to stop mr @entity8 spreading unfounded rumours about his son			1
the retired journalist , who lives in @entity68 , said : ‘ @entity11 ’s schemes failed to raise any money , partly due to his own shortcomings as a charity organiser and partly because it was an impossible task to make a success of any project that kept being slated on the internet			2
‘ the takings ( for the trust ) appear to have been pitiful			0
when he died , there was little money in his bank account and the trust was £ 1,400 in the red			0
that does n’t make him a conman			0
deplorable : @entity60 , pictured with @entity11 , right , in the mid 1970s believes the alleged bullying hastened his son 's death ‘ it is deplorable for the @entity0 to stand on the sidelines			2
@entity8 was working for a national institution funded by the @entity94 taxpayer and was very much in the public eye			2
’ a @entity0 spokesman said : ‘ we offer our sincere condolences to mr @entity11 but strongly assert the @entity0 has treated the complaints in question seriously			1
no evidence of cyber-bullying was found and the complaint was not upheld			0
’ one of the online messages , purportedly written by the radio host , allegedly said : ‘ @entity11 , if you are reading this – which , my friends , he might be – give it up , come clean on the finances of the trust , put the items you claim to have from the famous to good @entity113 ’ll auction them for some people in real need instead of false events that help no one			0
’ one of mr @entity11 ’s tormentors , a woman from @entity120 , was questioned by police after he complained about her behaviour in november 2011			0
she was ‘ given advice ’ by officers but not charged with any offence			0
but when mr @entity11 ’s father wrote to the @entity0 after his son ’s death , the managing editor of @entity26 , @entity127 , said that since mr @entity8 was a ‘ freelance artist ’ , the corporation had no responsibility for his off - air activities			1
mr @entity8 ’s links with the @entity0 , however , are long - established and he hosts a three - hour show on @entity26 every weekday morning			1
@entity11 said in a court statement relating to his libel action : ‘ people think i am a conman , dishonest , and even that i have made up the death of my sister			0
because he ( @entity8 ) works for the @entity0 everyone follows he ( sic ) and joins in			1
’ @entity60 ’s complaint against mr @entity8 is now being re-examined by one of the @entity0 ’s most senior executives , @entity144			1
mr @entity8 combines his broadcasting career with running two restaurants in @entity148			2
our calls to him went unanswered			0
