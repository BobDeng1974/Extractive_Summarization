asked whether he would rather win $ 11.44million at the @entity2 finale or be part of a winning @entity6 @entity5 team , @entity0 champion @entity0 hesitated for only a second			1
‘ that would be a tough one , ’ he began , before delivering an answer suggesting it was n’t hard at all			2
‘ when you look at my career , i ’ve won a major , i ’ve won other tournaments but i ’ve never won the @entity5			2
‘ at the end of my career i would love to have done that and who knows , this might be my last chance			2
so right now i would like to win the @entity5			2
i would like to experience the team atmosphere that follows a win			1
’ team player : @entity0 has his sights set on @entity5 glory how they shape up : @entity0 is third in the rankings that ’s rather thrown the gauntlet down then , has n’t it ? his answer was certainly a refreshing contrast to the depressing one @entity29 gave to a similar question in 2002 , when he said there were a million reasons why he would rather win the $ 1m first prize at the @entity34 than the @entity5 played the following week			1
@entity0 showed how much he loves the biennial competition at the last edition at @entity37			1
he was a revelation , catching the @entity39 off - guard completely on the opening day when he encouraged the crowd to cheer as he struck his drive off the first tee			2
will he be doing something similar at @entity45 ? ‘ no , i will not be doing that , ’ he said , smiling broadly			1
‘ we were on home soil and it was just my little way of trying to grow the game of golf			2
i loved it when @entity53 joined in the following day but it was a one - time thing			2
and i would not do that especially on foreign soil , where they might be against it			0
’ the 35 - year - old from @entity61 , @entity59 is often portrayed as country yokel but his answers display a real street intelligence			0
getting into the swing of things : @entity0 during practice in @entity68 on tuesday at @entity45 he will resume his pairing with @entity70 that delivered two points in the fourballs at @entity37			1
here was his response when one reporter suggested @entity76 was the calm one in the partnership			0
‘ y’all got time for a little story ? ’ he began			0
‘ @entity70 was playing really well going into the @entity80 in @entity81 but he was really jumpy in our match against @entity84 and @entity85			0
we were two down after just four holes , so i took him to one side			0
‘ i said : “ @entity70 , look man you ’re the 8th ranked golfer in the world			0
half the players above you are @entity39 so that makes you the fourth or fifth best player here			0
eyes on the prize : @entity0 wants the @entity5 to complete his set ' two of those are @entity29 and @entity102 and they ’re on our team			1
so that makes you second best			0
now go out and play like it and make some putts			0
‘ and i think he birdied the next two holes			0
so i calmed him down and i see that as my role , trying to make my team - mates relax			1
’ only once did we get goofy @entity0			1
@entity0 said he would prepare for the @entity5 like it was a major , with one big exception			1
‘ we do n’t have to pack a suitcase do we , as all the uniforms are going to be over there , ’ he said			0
that ’s all i got to pack			0
other than that , it ’s still golf			0
you still practice at your house , work on your short game , work on your irons , your driver			0
’ talking tactics : @entity0 sees himself as a calming influence in the @entity6 camp as for the @entity132 , the final leg of the @entity2 play - offs , @entity0 is one of five players — the others are @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 — in control of their own destiny			1
if any wins this event , with its $ 1.44m ( £ 895,000 ) first prize , they will walk away with the $ 10m ( £ 6.2m ) @entity149 bonus			1
@entity0 gave short shrift to those players moaning about fatigue , at the end of a run of six events in seven weeks			1
‘ you should be energized if you ’ve got the chance to take home $ 11.44 million , ’ he said			1
‘ how many chances are you going to get to do that in your lifetime ? ’ it was one more good answer in a press conference full of them			0
go @entity0 , as they say in these parts .			1

@entity0 *chasing* team prize to complete set of *silverware*
@entity0 willing to trade @entity2 *success* to be victorious at @entity45
