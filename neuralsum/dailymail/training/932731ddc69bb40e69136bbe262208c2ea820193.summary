by @entity0 published : 15:42 est , 27 march 2013 updated : 15:42 est , 27 march 2013 @entity1 has come under fire from parents after the search term ' teen books for girls ' was found to yield pornographic content			1
grandmother @entity8 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , told @entity11 she first raised the issue in november , after discovering the disturbing results while browsing the website for a book to give to her 12 - year - old granddaughter			1
' i was speechless , ' ms @entity8 said of her discovery			0
' i just could not believe that this was happening			0
' disturbing : last november , @entity9 grandmother @entity8 ( pictured ) was shocked to discover that a search on @entity1 for ' teen books for girls ' resulted in pornographic content ms @entity8 's initial search took place nearly four months ago , but searches today have not yielded the same results			1
indeed , a spokesman for the company has informed @entity32 : ' we have improved our search functionality since receiving this customer feedback , and will continue to do so			1
' the grandmother stumbled upon the graphic books when she typed ' teen ' into the @entity1 search box , hoping to find a book for her granddaughter			1
' i always give books to my grandkids for @entity45 , ' she told @entity11 at the time			1
the search term ' teen books for girls ' appeared in a drop - down list , and ms @entity8 clicked on it			1
while the first page of results yielded innocent titles like @entity55 , the second page was filled with ' adult , pornographic picture books , ' she recounted			2
' i ca n't even say the name of them			0
' ' i discovered adult , pornographic picture books			2
i ca n't even say the names of them ' some of the titles were @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 , according to @entity11 , and the covers featured almost - naked and topless girls			2
what 's more , the unexpected search results did not appear to be a fluke - at the time , 91 of the 140 suggested titles were graphic adult picture books			1
shocked , ms @entity8 contacted a customer service representative who told her @entity1 would follow up on her complaint			1
shocking : after clicking on search term ' teen books for girls ' from a drop - down list , ms welter found pornographic novels with revealing cover images of girls unexpected results : ms @entity8 stumbled upon the graphic books when she typed ' teen ' into the website 's search box , hoping to find an age - appropriate book for her granddaughter but just yesterday , the raunchy titles still remained on the website			1
on tuesday , @entity11 reported that not only did the innocent search term still result in over 100 explicit images , but that even more graphic titles had been added since ms @entity8 's original search			0
but when @entity32 performed the same search today , the books did not include any inappropriate content			1
' kids ca n't go in an adult book store			0
they should not be able to find this stuff so easily online ' ms @entity8 said her biggest concern is that children have access to these explicit images			0
' they ca n't go in an adult book store , ' she said			0
' they should not be able to find this stuff so easily online			0
' other angered parents have taken to @entity115 's @entity114 page to share their similar concerns			0
one commenter wrote : ' @entity1 needs to get rid of that asap ! shame on them ! ' while another posted : ' thank you to caring parents , grandparents and others who take appropriate action and alert others as well			2
' indecent : shockingly , the unexpected search results did not appear to be a fluke - at the time , 91 of the 140 suggested titles were graphic adult picture books the issue was especially surprising since in @entity1 's content guidelines , the company states that they do not accept ' pornography or offensive depictions of graphic sexual acts '			1
but the problem may be a result of the website 's self - publishing service , which allows any user to upload their stories and choose which keywords will be linked to them			2
' the internet is totally the @entity149 - anything goes , anything can be published ' @entity151 , president of @entity152 and web - based media expert , explained that the internet is ' totally the @entity149			0
anything goes , anything can be published			0
' he said : ' the truth is , the volume of everything that is going on the web is beyond human capabilities to edit or review			0
' still , @entity11 noted that the url address for each of the books included the term ' teen - books - for - girls ' , perhaps indicating that the titles were purposely geared towards teenagers .			2

the problem was brought to light when a grandmother was searching for books for her 12 - year - old granddaughter
@entity1 told @entity32 that they have since ' improved their search functionality ' in *reaction* to the *negative* feedback
