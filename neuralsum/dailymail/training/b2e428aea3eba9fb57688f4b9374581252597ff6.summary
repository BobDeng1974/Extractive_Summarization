feast away : scientists have found overeating will not affect blood sugar levels in people who exercise a short daily workout now could combat over-eating and days of lazing about at @entity7 , scientists claim			1
research has shown a short period of indulgence can cause long - term effects on the body			0
but a new study released today revealed this can be countered by 45 minutes of exercise a day in the run up to the festive season - even if the amount of calories consumed is significantly more than those burned off			1
experts at the @entity22 found exercising during a time of excess can stabilise blood sugar levels and prevent damage to metabolism			1
in a group of 26 healthy young men , half of them only exercised daily on a treadmill for 45 minutes , while the other half remained entirely inactive			1
all of the participants were told to overeat			0
those who did not exercise increased their calorie intake by 50 per cent and the others consumed 75 per cent more			0
but after one week , the non-exercising group 's blood sugar levels fell into an unhealthy decline , while those doing a daily workout showed no side effects from the extra food			1
metabolism also slowed in the men that did not exercise , the study showed , as the genes in their fat cells were not adequately activated to process the sizable meals			2
dr @entity51 , senior author of the paper , published in the @entity53 today , said : ' we matched the energy surplus between groups , so the exercising group consumed even more and were still better off at the end of the week			2
' if you are facing a period of over-consumption and inactivity this @entity7 , then our study shows that a daily bout of exercise will prevent many of the negative changes in the way in which your body handles sugar , even if you do still gain weight			1
' solution : study found we can indulge in peace if we do a short daily bout of exercise in the run up to @entity7 dr @entity77 , one of the researchers who worked on the study , added : ' this new research shows that the picture is more sophisticated than " energy " alone			2
exercise has positive effects even when we are actively storing energy and gaining weight			0
' dr @entity87 , also from the university , added : ' short - term overfeeding and reduced physical activity had a dramatic impact on the overall metabolic health of the participants and on various key genes within fat tissue			0
' however , even though energy was still being stored , regular exercise prevented many of the long - term negative changes from taking place			0

exercising 45 minutes a day a week before @entity7 could be enough
study at @entity22 found indulgence did not affect exercisers
non-exercisers had slowed metabolism and dropped blood sugar levels
