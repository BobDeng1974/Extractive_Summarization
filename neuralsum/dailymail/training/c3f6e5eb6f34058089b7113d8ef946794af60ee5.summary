so , @entity0 are on the verge of winning the @entity2 and @entity3 did n’t progress beyond the group stage			1
it ’s not great , is it ? especially when you think that @entity3 beat @entity0 5 - 1 in 2001			1
i was in the team so i remember it well — @entity11 ’s hat - trick and the team coming together to play slick and clinical football			2
they did n’t blame the players for losing , they realised that the system was wrong and they changed the system			0
we need to do the same thing			0
we have to stop blaming players like @entity48 and @entity21 ... there was talk about how they had lost heart , they had n’t given enough for their country			0
i promise you , this is absolute rubbish			0
when a player pulls on an @entity3 shirt he will do anything to win for his country			2
but there comes a time when it needs more than heart … it needs a proper structure that enables them to be the greatest team they can			1
@entity0 provided that structure and look what has happened			2
rout : @entity72 celebrates after scoring his team 's sixth goal against @entity75 in the 7 - 1 win deadly : @entity0 's @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 ( from left ) during their own hammering implosion : @entity75 's @entity84 cuts a lonely figure as @entity0 run riot in the semi final to put their 5 - 1 loss firmly behind after that defeat 13 years ago , they ripped up the coaching manual and started again			1
they worked out what needed to be changed and they changed it			0
this is what @entity0 did : room for improvement : @entity14 must rip up the coaching manual and start again as @entity0 did looking ahead : the @entity102 want @entity3 fans to enjoy success at @entity105 after a dismal @entity2 on the up : @entity3 must look at how @entity0 responded in 2001 and work on improving themselves there ’s no doubt we could do everything @entity0 did and more , so as you watch the final on sunday evening , just think : if the @entity102 choose to learn the lessons of this @entity2 , it will be @entity3 who we are watching in the final in future , not @entity0			1
glum : @entity3 must take responsibility for youth development as @entity0 did after the 5 - 1 humiliation difference : @entity3 can make the @entity2 final in the future but the @entity102 must learn from this tournament the latest issue of @entity127 's magazine - 5mag – is out on sunday			1
it is a @entity2 edition that has interviews with @entity130 and @entity131			0

@entity3 beat @entity0 5 - 1 in 2001 - they used that defeat to transform
@entity14 , @entity3 and the @entity102 must do the same after 2014 @entity2
@entity0 have **34,970** @entity137 ( @entity138 , a or b ) **licensed** coaches **compared** to just **2,769** in @entity3
we need to get our *priorities* *straight* - the game starts at **grassroots**
youth development needs looking at because the **national** team is suffering
do this , and we *'ll* be in the @entity2 final in the future like @entity0 are
they *introduced* more and better coaching . ten years on from that 2001 defeat , @entity3 had **2,769** @entity137 ( @entity138 , a or b ) **licensed** coaches **compared** to **34,970** in @entity0 . @entity3 need more coaches and more *highly* - *qualified* coaches working at all levels of the game .
they made sure there was more game time for young players . young players in @entity28 ***academies*** have roughly five times the game time that those in @entity171 ***academies*** have . the grass - roots game is where footballing greatness starts . we have to get our youth football right .
they made sure there was a clearly *defined* route between the **grassroots** and the **national** game , so that good players were fast - tracked into the *senior* set - up . we need to make sure this is happening in @entity3 , too . a proper structure means we keep talented players in the game .
they made sure they took responsibility for youth development and the future of the @entity0 team . it feels as if that task has been handed to club ***academies*** and centres of *excellence* in this country , which means there is not an @entity3 development *programme* but club development *programme*s . this is fine but it means the *importance* of winning games at a young age comes at the *expense* of developing *technique* and it means that if the clubs get it wrong , the @entity3 team suffer . the @entity102 need to take more control .
in @entity0 they *sorted* out what their footballing philosophy was . they were clear about what they wanted from players and how to achieve it . there needs to be an @entity102 philosophy on how to develop players . what is the @entity102 ’s philosophy on the game ? most *people* think that a more *technical* , *possession* - based game has been *lacking* in @entity171 football . are the @entity102 *addressing* this ? what is being done ? the @entity102 need to instill a football *intelligence* in young players and this needs to be *reflected* in every side from the first team to the @entity241 , so the players understand the @entity3 way of playing .
