@entity6 pulled over at the end of a bus stop in @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , to let her 84 - year - old father , @entity12 , out			1
but she was spotted by @entity14 's spy car and slapped with a £ 35 ticket			1
enraged : driver @entity6 has contested the fine from @entity14 and says she will take her fight to court if necessary mrs @entity6 has contested the fine , which has since risen to £ 167 , and says she is prepared to take her fight to court			1
mrs @entity6 , 61 , said : ' my father was 84 at the time and six weeks later he was in hospital with pneumonia			1
he has emphysema in both lungs and he ca n't walk that far			0
i thought why get a blue badge as he only goes up the road			0
' i did n't even get out the car			2
' the fine came through the post stating she had been watched for one minute pulling over in the bus stop			0
it also included two pictures of the incident - one with the passenger door open taken at 11.21am and 38 seconds and another at 11.21am and 45 seconds when he was completely out of the car			2
mrs @entity6 , who lives in @entity10 , appealed but it was rejected and bailiffs instructed to chase her for the bill			1
snapped : parking bosses sent these images to @entity46 of the incident which show she stopped for seven seconds in the bus lane she said : ' £ 167 for all of ten seconds or less			1
we are talking about a few seconds and i was n't parked - i 'd stopped to let him out			2
' i 'd like to go to court , i want to have my say			0
it does n't seem at all fair that it can go on for a year and i have n't been taken to court			2
' it must have cost them a fortune to do this			0
' @entity60 , @entity14 's parking manager , said the council had rejected the challenge			1
