@entity3 did their bit on a weekend of @entity2 upsets to book a place in the fifth round , but it remains to be seen if strikers @entity6 and @entity8 will still be at the club when that game comes around next month			1
manager @entity11 brought his two stars off the bench at @entity14 , and it was @entity6 who made the breakthrough as nine - man @entity18 crashed out			1
the @entity21 striker is set to join @entity22 before the transfer window closes if the two clubs can agree a fee of up to £ 5million , while £ 12m - rated @entity8 continues to interest top - flight teams			1
with @entity3 £ 79.8m in debt and operating under a transfer embargo , the dilemma is clear : by selling their prize assets to reduce that figure @entity34 owners @entity35 ’s could also be killing off the club ’s fading hopes of promotion back to the @entity39			2
it ’s enough to drive some managers to distraction but @entity11 will accept if @entity6 and @entity8 are sold			1
@entity22 target @entity6 scores the winning goal for @entity3 with 12 minutes left to play @entity3 came from behind to beat nine - man @entity18 3 - 1 in their @entity2 fourth round clash at @entity3 have only lost two of their last 20 home ties in the @entity2			1
‘ it would be a huge blow , of course it would , ’ he said			2
‘ personally , we have to try and keep all our players in this window			2
but if they were to go i ’m sensible enough			2
i ’ve been brought up the right way to not throw my toys out of the pram and get on with it			0
‘ that is all i can do			0
if they were to get sold i would go out and find the next one			0
‘ @entity64 went to @entity65 , @entity66 goes to @entity65			0
eventually it seems to happen to every player these days			0
all you do is dust yourself down , wish them all the best and crack on			0
‘ i would obviously put my opinion forward but at the end of the day the owners of the club are there to make the financial decisions			0
’ @entity3 ’s passage to the next round was smoothed by the sixth - minute dismissal of @entity18 defender @entity80			1
@entity81 was then shown a straight red for a crude challenge in added time and will now miss @entity39 fixtures against @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88			0
@entity6 helped @entity3 reach the fifth round of the @entity2 , but may not be at the club to play that game @entity8 ( centre ) is another player who could be set for a transfer away from @entity14 @entity3 manager @entity11 greets opposition boss @entity95 before the game at @entity14			1

@entity3 beat @entity18 3 - 1 in the @entity2 fourth round
@entity6 came off the bench to score for the hosts
both @entity6 and @entity8 have been linked with moves away
