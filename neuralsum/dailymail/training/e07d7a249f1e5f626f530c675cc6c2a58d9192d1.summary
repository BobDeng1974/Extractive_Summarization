@entity1 too many glasses of fizzy drink does n't just make you fat - it could also make your dodgy knees worse			1
researchers studied patients suffering from osteoarthritis in their knees , which is a common degenerative condition affecting six million older adults in the @entity12			1
they found that the more soft drinks patients consumed , the faster their condition progressed			2
slim men were found to be particularly affected			0
' this study may offer the potential to identify a modifiable dietary risk factor for disease progression , enable evaluation of prevailing recommendations of healthy diet , and thus have potential public health implications			0
' sugary drinks joins the other known risk factors including obesity , aging and joint stress			0
for the study , researcher looked at data on 2,149 patients who had been diagnosed with osteoarthritis following an x-ray			2
at the beginning of the study , each participant 's soft - drink consumption , not including sugar - free drinks was measured using a @entity52			0
the researcher followed up with the participants 12 , 24 , 36 and 48 months later to track their oa progression as measured by joint space change in their medial knee compartments			0
body mass index ( a measure of obesity ) was also measured and tracked and data for men and women were analysed separately			0
after controlling for @entity67 and other factors that may contribute to knee @entity69 , men who consumed more soft drinks per week had worse progression of their condition			1
the joint space became narrower by an average of 0.29 millimeters in men who drank no soft drinks to 0.59 millimeters in men who drank more than five soft drinks a week			0

the researchers concluded that the more soft drinks men drink , the worse their knees may get			1
it is unclear whether this problem is due to high - calorie soft drinks leading to excess weight burdening knees , or if there are other ingredients in soft drinks that contribute to @entity69 progression .			2

osteoarthritis in the knees affects around six million adults in the @entity12
study *suggests* fizzy drinks can make condition worse in all men and in normal weight women
