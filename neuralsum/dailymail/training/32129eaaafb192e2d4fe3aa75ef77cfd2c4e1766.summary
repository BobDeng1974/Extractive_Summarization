@entity0 will descend on ‘ @entity1 ’ in july for a two - week , high - altitude training camp designed to leave them in peak physical condition ahead of the home @entity5			1
@entity7 has arranged to take an expanded national squad of about 50 players — plus coaches and support staff — to @entity1 , @entity12 , as a means of enhancing their physical condition and escaping the pressurised tournament build - up at home			1
the city ’s nickname is based on its location , which is a mile above sea level at 5,280ft , amid the foothills of the @entity23			1
while in the city , @entity0 ’s training base will be @entity26 , in the suburb of @entity28 ; home of the @entity30 and a venue known as ‘ @entity32 ’			2
mile up : @entity0 coach @entity7 is ensuring his @entity5 squad will be in peak physical condition @entity7 knows the facilities from his time as head coach of the @entity37 , when he and @entity38 coached @entity0 ’s second - string side at the @entity40 in @entity1			1
a handful of players involved in that event may be back there next summer , including @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48			0
it is understood talks began months ago about the notion of temporarily moving @entity0 en masse to an alternative location , partly to guard against staleness during the prolonged @entity5 countdown			2
various options were discussed before @entity7 decided a return to familiar territory in the @entity58 made most sense			0
since then , @entity0 ’s strength and conditioning staff have travelled to @entity12 and fully endorse the choice			0
passionate : @entity7 and his team will be determined for @entity0 to perform at the home @entity5 the benefits of training at altitude — where the air is thinner so the body has to work harder for oxygen — are well - established in a wide variety of sports			1
@entity0 expect to boost the fitness of their players in terms of accelerating the necessary fat - burning process , but accept that there will not be a respiratory ‘ legacy ’ by the time the @entity5 starts in mid-september			1
after having four weeks off at the end of this season , the squad will reconvene for a fortnight at @entity84 then fly across the @entity85 for two weeks in @entity1			0
at the end of their stay , there is a possibility that @entity92 ’s men will take part in a training game against the @entity95 — whose union are based in nearby @entity97 , @entity12			0
however , firm plans are still some way off			0
sprawling : the @entity26 in @entity1 , @entity12 , will host @entity0 's rugby squad next summer upon returning home , @entity0 will take a week ’s break before re-gathering in @entity103 ahead of warm - up matches against @entity105 , home and away , and @entity107			1
by then , they will hope to be feeling the benefits of their stateside excursion			0
for @entity7 and his coaches , fitness is a hot topic after the june tour of @entity114 , which concluded with a heavy defeat by the @entity114 in @entity116 that created concerns about the condition of their side			0
three of @entity0 ’s @entity5 - winning women ’s team — @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 — have retired from international rugby following their triumph in @entity127 last month .			2
