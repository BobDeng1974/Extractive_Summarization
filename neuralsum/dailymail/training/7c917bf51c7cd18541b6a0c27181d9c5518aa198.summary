by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 07:19 est , 15 september 2013 updated : 06:19 est , 16 september 2013 the @entity3 conference grew increasingly stormy today , as delegates in @entity5 were battered by high winds			1
the main entrance to the @entity8 was closed to activists , who arrived with a warning to @entity11 that they want a power - sharing deal with @entity13 after the next election			1
however the @entity3 leader hinted he would prefer a power - sharing deal with the @entity17 , arguing he wants the chance to ' finish the job ' of repairing the economy begun in partnership with @entity22			1
battered : high winds and heavy rain made it increasingly difficult for @entity3 to even reach the party 's conference in @entity5 @entity28 hard work : after a day of sunshine on saturday , gloom has descended on the party gathering the first full day of the conference proved hair - raising for some the @entity3 leader insisted he had not held secret talks about forming a government with either of the main parties - but then saved his biggest economic criticism for @entity13			1
but it risks infuriating his party members demoing the @entity3 to forge a power - sharing deal with @entity13 after the next election			1
mr @entity11 has ordered his ministers ‘ lift the veil ’ on private battles with the @entity17 in government , including policy fights over welfare , employment law , immigration and climate change			0
but challenged over the role the @entity3 would play working with either party in 2015 , mr @entity11 appeared to favour the @entity17			2
gloomy : @entity11 braved the cold as he walked to the @entity56 studios in @entity5 this morning hair - raising : before the security marquee was shut , delegates had to make a mad dash through the rain he claimed @entity13 left to run the country alone would ' wreck ' the economy , but suggested only that the @entity17 would not be quite as fair			1
he told @entity68 's @entity67 programme : ' it is my genuine belief that if you go back to the bad old days , not of coalition and balanced politics , but either the left or the right dominating government on their own , you will get a recovery that is neither fair nor sustainable			2
' i think @entity13 would wreck the recovery , and under the conservatives , who do n’t have the same commitment to fairness that we do , you ’d get the wrong kind of recovery			2
' so our message is : coalition is good ; what the @entity3 have done in government is good			2
let us finish the job , but let us finish it fairly			0
' the @entity95 on sunday published a poll conducted by the website @entity97 , which found that 39 per cent of activists questioned would prefer a @entity99 after 2015 , compared with just 15 per cent who favour another coalition with the conservatives			0
a further 15 per cent of those questioned said that , in the event of a hung parliament , mr @entity11 's party should forge a " confidence and supply " agreement with @entity13 , under which @entity3 would not enter coalition but would undertake not to bring down the minority government or vote against its budget			1
just 6 per cent wanted an arrangement of this kind with @entity17			0
mr @entity11 predicted more coalitions in future , suggesting @entity13 and the @entity102 will have to draw up a ‘ shopping list ’ manifesto , with a handful of key policiies and others which could be haggled over during coalition talks			1
he said : ‘ in my view it is going to more likely than not that in the future you ’re going to get more coalitions , it is less likely that you ’re going to these slam - dunk results when one or the other of the two major parties always get a majority			1
‘ i think it is incumbent on all political parties to be up front with the @entity139 people – as we were last time – about those issues which you really will die in the trench for , and those which clearly will depend on political and economic circumstances			0
’ blustery : many delegates were not well - prepared for the weather wet wet wet : @entity3 president @entity149 ( left ) and pensions minister @entity148 got caught out in the rain in the pink : @entity11 boasted that his party was making a difference in government he said his focus was on returning to the @entity3 to power in 2015 , and hinted at a desire to continue working with the @entity17 on the economic plan which is already underway			1
' our message to the @entity139 people in 2015 will be essentially this : we will say : we ’ve done very good things in government , but let us finish the job and finish the job fairly			0
' because there are millions of people in this country who have made huge sacrifices , we ’ve gone through this very difficult time over the last two or three years – that would be squandered if you had a single - party government of either the @entity13 [ party ] or the @entity102 in 2015			1
' i think @entity13 would wreck the recovery , and under the conservatives , who do n’t have the same commitment to fairness that we do , you ’d get the wrong kind of recovery			2
' prediction : the @entity3 leader told @entity190 there would be more coalitions in future - and all parties had to prepare for talks damning : @entity195 says it is a ' myth ' that taxing high value property could be a source of income for the government @entity11 stepped up calls for higher taxes on the wealthy , as he signalled soaking the rich will be a key demand of the @entity3 at the next election			1
he said the party 's commitment to a mansion tax on properties over £ 2 million , raising £ 2 billion , sent a signal that ' even though we are committed to deficit reduction ' that would not be achieved entirely through spending cuts			0
he told the @entity56 : ' taxes and particularly taxes on people who can afford it , have to play some role in the ongoing effort to making sure that we complete the job of filling the black hole in the public finances			0
' if the @entity102 do n't want to do that then they need to tell people , and that 's part of the debate we will have to have over the next year - and - a - half , what they will cut - schools or hospitals or pensions or police or the armed services - to make up that £ 2 billion			2
' however mr @entity11 's plans for a ‘ mansion tax ’ have been savaged by @entity195 – former wife of disgraced @entity3 mp @entity239			0
ms @entity195 says it is a ‘ myth ’ that taxing homes worth more than £ 2 million will be a ‘ magic source of income ’ for the government			0
ms @entity195 , who will attend the @entity3 conference in @entity5 , dismisses the whole idea of a mansion tax , which has been blocked by the conservatives			0
in an article for today ’s @entity250 , she says : ‘ it is a tax that is set at an arbitrary level with no economic justification for that level or the rate imposed – except to raise a certain amount of money ’ and ‘ a mantra for those who feel there is a hidden reservoir of taxes just waiting to be tapped ’			0
ms @entity195 also pointedly disagrees with her friend @entity263 , the business secretary , who has raised fears that @entity265 plans for low - deposit mortgages could lead to a new house price bubble			0
‘ there are concerns over a housing market bubble – expressed by @entity263 no less – but i do n’t share them , ’ she says .			2

@entity3 leader warns recovery would be *threatened* if @entity13 wins power
says a @entity102 majority government would not less ' fair ' without @entity3
predicts more coalitions in future with parties forced to *abandon* policies
but splits emerged with @entity263 over the economy and housing
