it has gone on display for the first time at the @entity6			1
the @entity12 , which translates as the @entity14 , shows some of the medical methods practiced in @entity16 five centuries ago and is one of the earliest @entity4 medical texts			2
the book , first printed in @entity19 , @entity20 , in 1491 , is a fusion of late medieval science and folklore			1
it contains detailed writings and annotated illustrations on plants , herbs , animals , and minerals			1
meanwhile , detailed illustrations reveal how physicians used to study the colour of urine to make diagnoses			2
it was once owned by @entity37 , an @entity38 apothecary who in the early 1600s taught at the then newly - established @entity40 - one of the two founding colleges which merged to become the @entity6 in 1860			1
@entity42 , head of special collections at the @entity6 , said : ' @entity44 was the most popular and influential herbals of its time , and served as an encyclopedia of all knowledge and folklore on plants , animals , and minerals			1
' it combines elements of natural history with subjects traditionally found in herbals , accompanied by mythical fantasies and fables			2
' there are striking depictions of contemporary medical practice , the making of drug compounds , treatment for the removal of head lice etcetera , as well as the settings for much of this , a surgery and an apothecary ’s shop			2
' one image shows a woman removing head lice from a young boy			2
' another shows a boy removing honey from a comb			2
in the medieval period honey was used in a wide variety of ways , to cure coughs , as a diuretic , as a cure for some poisons and even as an application to rid hair of lice			0

urine charts and astrological charts were used side - by - side by physicians to diagnose diseases and to determine treatment			0
' the book is part of a new exhibition , @entity117 , meaning ' preparation of drugs ' , which includes some of the earliest recorded interpretations of the natural sciences			1
items on display demonstrate the history of pharmacy and medical chemistry from its roots in a monastic setting through to modern chemical isolation and synthesis			1
another ' very rare ' compendium written in @entity133 in the early 15th century includes herb and plant based remedies for a range of minor and major ailments , from bad breath , nose bleeds and snake bites to broken limbs , childbirth and tumours			0
it reads : ' here men may see the uses of diverse herbs , which may be hot and may be cold , and how many things they can be used for			0
' ms @entity42 said : ' it was an easy - to - use reference book			1
a boy removes honey from the comb and makes a mess of his face in the process physicians consulting a series of patients in a sick room a woodcut illustration of a group of intellects deep in discussion on a medical or botanical matter ' it lists fennel leaf which is said to be good for headaches and also that " to do away with aching and swelling in the womb " the patient should " drink dried fennel leaf "			0
' more soberly , and reflecting the high infant and maternal death in childbirth there are numerous references to concoctions and recipes to ease labour pains , to accelerate deliveries and to assist with childbirth situations			0
' for example on this page , " if the child be dead in the mother ’s womb take mugwort and stamp it small and plaster it to the mother ’s womb until all cold and she will have delivery "			0
' following on from that is the use of hemlock as a cure for insomnia : " hemlock will make a man sleep			0
soak the herb in water and apply it to the temples and forehead and after bathe his feet in it , as hot as he may suffer it			0
then make a plaster of henbane seed and apply it to his temples " '			0
many of the detailed drawings provide an insight into the relationship between humans and animals at the time the exhibition also highlights the work of the early plant collectors such as professor @entity217 , who made a substantial contribution to the @entity219 and the @entity220			1
as well as tracing the history of the use of plants in medicine , the exhibition explores how plants are still being used to find new drugs , even if there is no historical use of the plant to treat disease			1
ms @entity42 added : ' scientists at the @entity6 are engaged in the search for new treatments for infection , inflammation , parasitic diseases and cancer using nature ’s bounty			1
' more recently they have turned to investigating microorganisms from extreme environments such as the @entity244 , the deepest place on earth , the @entity247 desert , the driest place on earth and the @entity250			0
' cultivating bacteria and fungi from these environments has led to the discovery of unique compounds by @entity38 scientists which may form the basis of future treatments			0
' the exhibition runs until december 1 .			2
