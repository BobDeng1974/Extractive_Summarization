by @entity0 with a spaceship - like array of dials controlling everything from tyre circumference to wing flaps , @entity2 cars have changed a lot in 46 years			1
it was once a raw sport of man and car , as world champion @entity13 's vehicle proves			1
the racing legend 's 1968 @entity14 will be sold tomorrow for an estimated £ 1million - despite having just 10 simple instruments on a dashboard which could almost pass for a family saloon 's , alongside an ordinary - looking gearstick			1
a simple sport of man and car : racing legend @entity13 's 1968 @entity14 will be sold tomorrow for £ 1million - despite having just 10 instruments on its dashboard a lot changes in 46 years ! nowadays all the controls are on the steering wheel - which looks like a spaceship cockpit			1
last month @entity28 explained its controls ( pictured ) the enigmatic driver , whose son @entity32 also conquered the world of @entity2 , was the reigning world champion when he took delivery of the @entity14 in 1968 - hence the number one on its body			1
the car ’s predecessor , the @entity14 , had already set a new benchmark for performance and handling when it was unveiled the previous year			2
only 12 @entity42 were ever built , and the iconic car - which has come up for sale for the first time since the 1970s - is one of only a handful still in existence			2
@entity13 and his famous moustache raced the @entity14 in the @entity50 in early 1969 , notching up two second places and finishing fourth in the @entity52 @entity2 in @entity53			1
later that year @entity13 raced it in front of a home crowd at the @entity56 @entity2 , finishing seventh			1
the car boasted a 400bhp v8 engine and a top speed of more than 180mph - figures which sound tame compared to modern @entity2 cars but had world - beating potential at the time			1
its interior was certainly simpler than modern racers			0
over the last 46 years , @entity2 controls have gradually migrated to the steering wheel , which now contains almost every function a driver could ever need			1
magnificent : in accordance with @entity2 tradition , the @entity14 carried the number one on its body in honour of its driver @entity13 , who was the reigning world champion only 12 @entity42 were ever built , and the iconic car - which has come up for sale for the first time since the 1970s - is one of only a handful still in existence @entity86 : kept for its entire post-racing history by the collector @entity90 , the car still bears the name of its driver in large print and looks as it did in 1968 golden age : impressive though it is , the car 's lack of advanced controls and gadgets harks back to a simpler age of motor racing , a raw game of man and machine a thing of beauty : auctioneers at @entity108 claimed the car , which will be sold tomorrow , is one of the 10 most exquisite designs ever to grace a @entity2 track teams have spent millions developing their controls to make them easy for drivers to press , and most of the @entity2 competitors keep the fine details of their steering wheels a closely - guarded trade secret			1
but one team , @entity28 , released a detailed breakdown of how its steering wheel works this year - and it features more than 25 buttons , dials , switches and lights			1
@entity127 : @entity128 : early @entity129 : 400bhp @entity130 : @entity131 : £ 1million the functions include performance maps , rear wing flaps and even a tool to change the circumference of the wheel while driving			1
there is a pit limiter , which reduces the car 's speed when it needs quick maintenance , and a button to contact the pit team to warn them of a stop one lap ahead			2
after being raced by @entity13 , the @entity14 was sold to @entity148 racer @entity147 for the remainder of the 1969 season			2
the following year it passed to @entity152 driver @entity151 , who drove it to two @entity152 f1 wins , before it was retired into the hands of collector @entity90 shortly afterwards			0
he restored it to its former glory , saying it was his favourite of 15 classic cars he owned			0
the @entity14 is expected to fetch £ 700,000 to £ 1million when it is sold at the @entity159 near @entity160 , @entity161			1
tomorrow 's sale has a note of sad irony to it , as mr @entity90 was killed at the wheel of his @entity166 when it crashed at @entity159 14 years ago			1
glory : @entity13 racing the @entity14 a few months after he was named world champion in 1968			1
sadly it would not help him to victory - he finished eighth vintage : the same car being raced later in its career			2
it will be auctioned with a price tag of up to £ 1m at the @entity159 , where its owner died simpler days : almost 50 years old , the @entity2 car was less streamlined than its modern successors , with the rivets visible and not an adjustable wing flap in sight like father like son : @entity13 ( left ) won two @entity2 world championships in 1962 and 1968 , a feat which would be repeated once by his son @entity186 ( right ) in 1996 the car is being sold by mr @entity90 's family and its auctioneers described it as one of the ' top 10 groundbreaking f1 designs '			1
@entity192 , director of motoring at @entity108 , said : ' when it first rolled onto the track in 1967 the jaws of all the other competitors dropped			0
it simply blew its competition out of the water and set a benchmark for performance in @entity2			2
' @entity14 ’ engineers had found a way to save weight without curtailing performance and handling			2
they also debuted the @entity208 engine which had never been seen before and went on to notch up so many wins			0
' the developments pushed the envelope of what was possible in the sport and it became very clear the future of @entity2 lay with this design			2
' mr @entity192 added : ' it is the very last car to be sold from the estate of @entity218 who tragically died in 2000			0
it was his favourite from a collection of 15 classic cars , most of which were @entity224			0
' it is an extremely rare car with great provenance			0
' dynasty : an eight - year - old @entity32 gets tries on his father 's obe in 1968 for @entity56 racing legend @entity13 , it was not enough to win the @entity2 world championship twice - his son would have to win it too			1
in an industry which has had its share of dynasties , @entity13 and @entity32 remain the only father - son pairing ever to both take home the title of @entity243			0
born in @entity244 , north @entity245 , in 1929 , @entity13 served in the @entity246 but did not drive a car until the age of 24 - eventually venturing into the world of motor racing and shooting to prominence in the early 1960s			2
his first @entity243 win came in 1962 , and it would be six years before he won the title again			0
from then his racing career saw a gradual decline which ended in tragedy before he could bring himself back into the top spot			0
famously , @entity13 died in november 1975 when he tried and failed to land a plane in freezing fog			0
the crash killed him alongside five other members of the @entity264 team			0
his death shocked the close - knit world of @entity2 , and the village of @entity269 - home to the track of the same name - now has a road called @entity13 in his honour			1
but his legacy would live on in a more prominent way - his son @entity186			0
as a child @entity186 had watched his father win gong after gong and was just 15 when he died			0
@entity186 was determined to make a success of himself in the hyper - competitive world of motor racing			0
@entity283 team chiefs said they took him on because he was a ' tough b * * * * * * ' , and he did not disappoint			0
despite facing racing legends of the like of @entity286 , he ascended through the ranks in the early 1990s before eventually claiming the world championship in 1996			0
he was named the @entity289 and helped his family name go down as one of the most notable in @entity2 history .			0

the @entity14 was driven by the @entity56 world champion in 1968 with just 10 simple instruments on the dashboard
a modern @entity2 car has more than 25 buttons and dials just on the steering wheel - even controlling rear ' wing flaps '
*billed* as one of @entity2 's 10 best designs , @entity14 will go under the hammer at @entity159 near @entity160
