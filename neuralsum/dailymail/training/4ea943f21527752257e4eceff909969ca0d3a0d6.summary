by @entity0 a woman 's chance of going through life without having children has almost doubled over the past three decades , national statistics showed yesterday			2
nearly one in five of those who reached the end of their child - bearing years last year had no children , compared with just over one in ten of their mothers			1
the breakdown by the @entity13 showed that the most common family in @entity15 has two children – but among a generation of women born in the late 1960s , the next most likely outcome is that they have no children at all			2
family : the breakdown by the @entity13 showed that the most common family in @entity15 has two children ¿ but among a generation of women born in the late 1960s , the next most likely outcome is that they have no children at all there is also a historic rise in the number of single - child families , so that 15 per cent of mothers born in 1967 have just one child			1
the @entity13 pointed to a variety of reasons for growing childlessness and smaller families , including the decline of marriage , which has left many women without a stable home in which to have children			1
other factors leading to more childlessness are the greater costs of having children compared to sticking with a job or career and the ‘ greater social acceptability of the child - free lifestyle ’ , its report said			1
the @entity13 also said a key reason is ‘ the postponement of decisions about children until it may be biologically too late ’			2
the evidence was gathered by the @entity13 in its latest ‘ cohort fertility ’ figures – charts that show how many children were born to women of selected ages			2
researchers compared the child - bearing history of those born in 1967 , who reached 45 last year , with that of women from their mothers ’ generation , born in 1940			1
an average woman born in 1940 had 2.36 children , while an average member of her daughter ’s generation had 1.91			0
those born in 1940 had an 11 per cent chance of childlessness , compared to 19 per cent for the 1967 generation			0
@entity74 ran even higher for women born in 1965 and 1966 , but high immigration in recent years has raised the overall numbers of mothers living in @entity15			0
there have been high birth rates among women who have arrived in @entity15 since 1997			0
however , the @entity13 said that smaller families ‘ reflect women ’s postponement of child - bearing to older ages , for reasons including increased participation in higher education ’			1
stable home : @entity13 pointed to a variety of reasons for growing childlessness and smaller families , including the decline of marriage it also cited ‘ the desire to establish a career , get on the housing ladder and ensure financial stability before starting a family ’			1
and the @entity13 also noted the impact of the declining popularity of marriage			2
factors in delayed child - bearing include ‘ delayed marriage and partnership formation ’			1
independent analysts said that increasing childlessness is also a result of many couples having to rely on a double income to survive			0
family author and researcher @entity113 said : ‘ there is a downside to women ’s advancement in the jobs market – all women have to be at work to meet the cost of housing and living , and their husband or partner does n’t have an income good enough to rely on			0
‘ there is a tremendous loss if one of a couple leaves work , and there are no tax breaks to help them			0
women just ca n’t afford children			0
‘ no political party will face up to the fact that most women want to look after their own children			0
‘ they do n’t want to put them in daycare and they do n’t want the father doing it			0
’ the statistic of 15 per cent of women born in 1967 having just one child is the highest rate since the generation born in 1935			0
the spread of ‘ little emperor ’ families – named after the @entity154 phrase for parents with a single spoiled child – reverses a decline in the proportion of one - child families that dates from the @entity161			1
one - child families were most common among women born in the early 1920s			1
‘ around one fifth of women born in the 1920s had one child , ’ the report said			0
‘ this may be because their marriage and child - bearing were delayed or disrupted by @entity161			1

one in five of those who at end of child - bearing years had no children
@entity13 report showed rise in single - child families
decline of marriage and greater costs to blame , study says
