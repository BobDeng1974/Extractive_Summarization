energy giant @entity0 faces a multi-million - pound fine and a ban on telesales activity over a bills shambles that has hit 280,000 customers			1
industry regulator @entity6 has given it an ultimatum to improve customer service and deliver accurate bills by august or face a fine that could top £ 10million			1
the ruling is a victory for the @entity16 ’s @entity15 section , which triggered the investigation last year by submitting a dossier highlighting the shambles to the watchdog			2
energy secretary @entity21 said it was ' unacceptable that so many @entity0 customers have not received the customer service they deserve ' it contained dozens of letters and emails from people who suffered poor service , wildly inaccurate bills and frustrating delays in getting refunds			1
@entity0 received almost 1.4million complaints in 2013 – and the number in the first three months of 2014 was up 70 per cent on a year ago			2
hundreds of thousands of customers were not sent bills for months , sometimes more than a year , despite making repeated requests to know how much they owed			1
the result was that they then faced huge bills – of more than £ 1,000 in some cases – followed by demands to pay up or face some kind of enforcement action			2
there were also serious problems with incorrect direct debit payments			0
some customers are owed hundreds of pounds by @entity0 as result of over-payments , but have had difficulties getting their money back			1
@entity0 admitted in september that a computer glitch caused by a transfer to a new billing system had caused problems with 700,000 customer accounts			1
in december , it apologised and agreed to make a payment of £ 1million to vulnerable customers by way of redress			0
however the company still has a huge backlog of more than 400,000 bills to sort out and has been given an ultimatum by @entity6 to reduce that figure to 100,000 by the end of august or face a telesales ban			1
big six energy supplier must cut the number of accounts in its late billing backlog from around 400,000 today to 100,000 over the next three months the watchdog also announced an investigation into poor customer service associated with the way it handled complaints that could lead to a huge @entity81 , @entity6 ’s senior partner in charge of enforcement , said @entity0 customers had suffered ‘ service failures ’ for too long			1
‘ we have been increasingly concerned about the slow progress to tackle failings , ’ she said			0
@entity15 has been inundated with complaints from @entity0 customers			1
after a series of reports detailing wildly incorrect billing , delays getting refunds and poor customer service , we handed @entity6 a dossier of customer complaints last july			1
@entity99 and @entity100 from @entity101 , @entity102 , were among the angry users after moving to @entity0			2
the switch took five months to sort out , then the couple were not billed for nine months and were also locked out of their online account			0
after @entity15 intervened @entity0 sorted out the issue and paid £ 400 in compensation			2
mr @entity99 said the firm was ‘ incompetent from day one ’			0
‘ @entity0 ’s recovery plan has not delivered as far and fast as is necessary			1
our analysis of complaints data also raises some serious concerns which will be thoroughly examined in our investigation			0
’ thousands of people have contacted citizens ’ advice for help in dealing with @entity0			2
its chief executive , @entity122 , said : ‘ exposing customers to bill shock is completely unacceptable			0
providing accurate bills and dealing with problems quickly are the basics of decent customer service			1
@entity0 is a long way from providing that			2
’ energy secretary @entity21 joined the attack , describing @entity0 ’s customer service as ‘ unacceptable ’			1
@entity0 is a subsidiary of the giant @entity136 utility firm @entity135 , which has a history of failing @entity139 consumers			2
when it owned @entity142 it was fined £ 9.7million for failures in 2005 and 2006			0
it has also been criticised over its tax affairs			0
the firm made £ 750million profit in the three years 2009 to 2011 but paid no corporation tax			0
@entity0 ’s @entity139 chief executive , @entity149 , wrote to all 3.4million customers in december apologising but the company was forced to issue a second apology yesterday			1
it said it has assigned an extra 650 staff to help resolve customer service problems and it is spending £ 20million to improve its systems			1
mr @entity149 said @entity0 was ‘ committed to getting things right for our customers ’ and promised that none would be left out of pocket			1
energy tariff prices are in a constant merry - go - round with suppliers battling to pinch customers - you - from each other			0
shrewd consumers can take advantage of this by doing exactly that - moving deals every six months to a year to ensure they are on the cheapest deal			0
even moving every other year will save you significant amounts			0
suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs so if you 're ready to switch , it will certainly pay to do so			0
if you are one of the millions of people who have never switched ( i.e. stuck with your original supplier ) , then you will definitely save a big chunk of cash , possibly as much as £ 300 a year			0
prices are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you will depend where you live			0
you only need to be interested in the tariff that is going to be cheapest where you live , so do your own comparison to find the best price			0

@entity0 has run up huge backlog of bills that have not been processed
customers could be forced to find hundreds of pounds out of the blue
@entity6 opens probe into @entity0 ’s ' *prolonged* customer service failings '
regulator says if it does *n't* clear backlog it could be hit with telesales ban
