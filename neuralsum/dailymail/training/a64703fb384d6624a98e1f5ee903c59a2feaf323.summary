by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 and @entity3 are not the only @entity5 players with targets on their backs this week , according to @entity9 team - mate @entity8			1
@entity11 captain @entity10 has repeatedly said he is looking to take down ' big dogs ' @entity2 and @entity3 , the former being the world number one and four - time major winner and the latter earning the nickname ' mr @entity9 ' due to his heroics in the biennial contest			1
@entity3 's most recent heroics inspired the ' miracle at @entity22 ' in 2012 , when @entity5 recovered from 10 - 6 down on the final day to claim a remarkable seventh win in the last nine contests			1
@entity8 said that the @entity11 team 's poor record means they are under huge pressure to win this year the home side are rated odds - on favourites to improve that statistic further at @entity32 this weekend , but @entity8 insists they are not acting as such and is well aware of how determined the @entity11 side are to make amends for what happened two years ago			1
' i think it 's an unusual scenario for the @entity5 to be favourites coming into a @entity9 , ' @entity8 said			1
' it 's not a sort of label that we take lightly			0
we are very proud of the label			2
' we watched a video in the team room last night ( monday ) which really described how far the @entity46 had come , all the way back from the 1950s and ' 60s and getting drummed year - in and year - out in the @entity9 , to the turning point with ( @entity50 ) @entity49 and @entity51 ( @entity52 ) and everything that went on in that period when the @entity5 started to realise that perhaps they could compete on the global stage and they could compete in @entity56 , to the present day			1
@entity11 captain @entity10 said they will target @entity2 and @entity3 at @entity32 ' we are proud of the label , but we are also very aware that this is a big @entity9 this week , because we do feel the need for the @entity11 team to win one			1
we certainly feel like they will be coming at us 100 per cent this weekend and we have to be ready for that			0
we are not taking them lightly			0
' we heard a stat last night that when both teams were solidified after the picks that their average world ranking was better than our average world ranking			0
it might not be the same , at this moment we might be slightly favourites again , but we are under no illusions that this team is great			1
' they have a lot of young blood on their team which is going to ignite that passion that we 've always had			2
i think we have got targets on our back this week and we are aware of that , and we are going to be ready for it			0
' we are not getting sucked in by the favourite tag			2
we are going to play like underdogs			0
' @entity8 also said that @entity5 's team are proud of their favourites tag but ill not become complacent @entity5 captain @entity90 was not quite sure what @entity10 meant about ' targeting ' opposition players in a non-contact sport , but in any case he has no concerns that @entity2 and @entity3 can cope with whatever is thrown at them			1
' the two guys earned that reputation , ' @entity90 said			0
' they have played so well			0
@entity2 to be number one in the world and @entity3 with his performances in the @entity9			1
it 's not something that we should be afraid of or embarrassed about			0
' i can tell you one thing , it 's a real motivating factor for both of them that they know that it 's a big focus on the @entity11 playing them			2
@entity2 has enjoyed an excellent season , including winning @entity114 , propelling him to world no 1 ' i think @entity2 has handled the expectancy on him as world number one incredibly well			2
a lot of the tournaments he 's won , he 's won from a commanding position			0
he seems to be very comfortable when he has the favourite tag			2
' @entity3 is the same			2
every @entity9 you go in and you question is @entity3 going to perform , and he does			1
his record is sensational ( 12 wins in 15 matches ) and he 's very proud of it			0
' that 's one of the fruits of all his labours in the @entity9 , to have a target on him			1
i think @entity3 is relishing that			2
he 's relishing that fact			0
he likes playing the villain			0
' he was the guy they all wanted to bring down ( in @entity22 ) and he went out and produced , and not only did he produce saturday night but he went out on sunday and produced in the singles again			0
' @entity3 has won 12 of his 15 @entity9 matches , including an impressive singles victory at @entity22 @entity90 added : ' i 'm going to put out the team as i see fit , and whatever comments they have and whatever ideas @entity10 has to motivate his team , he 'll do			1
i 'm concerned with our team and making sure we 're prepared			0
' i 'm not targeting anybody on the @entity11 team			1
we know they are a very strong team one to 12 and whoever is playing this is going to be tough			0
we are under no illusions how strong this @entity11 team is , under no illusions whatsoever			1
this is going to be a tough @entity9 to win			1
' @entity8 , who secured the winning point at @entity155 in 2010 , agreed with his captain 's assessment , adding : ' i could n't pick two better guys to handle that type of pressure			2
@entity2 's the best player in the world and i expect him to win several points this weekend			1
' and @entity163 is just @entity163 , so he 'll be ready			0
' video closing holes at @entity32			0

@entity8 claims the @entity11 team needs to win the @entity9
@entity8 also says @entity5 are proud of their favourites tag
however , @entity8 claims they will take nothing for granted
@entity10 : @entity11 will target @entity3 and @entity2
