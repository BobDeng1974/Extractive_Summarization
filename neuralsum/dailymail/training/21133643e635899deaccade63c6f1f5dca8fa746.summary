a 28 - stone binge - eater who spent more than £ 20,000 on takeaways when she could n't afford to pay her mortgage has lost more than 15 stone after her home was repossessed			1
@entity7 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , who ballooned to a size 32 , would chomp her way through packets of biscuits , stodgy cheese sandwiches and multi-size bags of crisps until she fell asleep			1
unable to stop herself from eating , she consumed as much as she physically could until she dropped off , only to start again a few hours later when she woke in the middle of the night			2
before , left : at her heaviest , @entity20 ballooned to a size 32 and weighed a staggering 28st ; after , right : @entity7 lost 15st and now weighs 12st 7lbs and is a trim size 14 former binge eater @entity7 with husband @entity24 , 65 , who supported her through her weight loss @entity7 , 50 , who is now a slim 12st 7lbs and a size 14 , admits she was ' eating myself to death ' , forking out £ 100 on takeaways ' which could go towards my mortgage payments '			1
but it was n't until @entity7 met her third husband - and her home was repossessed after she failed to pay the mortgage that she realised the extent of her eating problem			1
she said : ‘ i had no switch - off button			2
i would eat and eat like a woman possessed			2
i ’d be halfway through a sandwich or a box of chocolates when i fell asleep			2
‘ and if that was n’t bad enough , i ’d wake up a couple of hours later and carry on until i was physically sick			2
' she continued : ‘ i look back now and i ’m absolutely disgusted			2
i was worse than an animal			2
’ but @entity7 was n’t always overweight			1
as a young girl she was very slim and through her teenage years hovered around a size 12 to 14			1
it was only after @entity7 had her son , @entity48 , now 31 , that she began to struggle with her weight			1
@entity20 ( pictured left at her wedding in 2010 and , right , looking trim today ) would chomp her way through packets of biscuits , stodgy cheese sandwiches and multi-size bags of crisps until she fell asleep she recalls : ‘ after he was born , i went up to 16 stone and was a size 20			1
’ determined to shed the extra baby pounds she contacted a local slimming company , @entity63 , and lost 7lbs , through healthy eating			1
‘ i felt wonderful , ’ says @entity7			1
‘ and for years stayed at the same weight			2
’ but after she married her first husband in the late 1990s , her old bad habits resurfaced			1
she said : ‘ it was n’t a happy marriage			2
i soon realised i was n’t in love and turned to food for comfort			1
i ’d treat myself to chocolates , packets of biscuits and crisps , to cheer myself up			2
‘ we ’d have a takeaway most nights for tea			2
it could be anything from pizza , a curry or a @entity83			2
before i knew it , i was a size 20 again			1
‘ and once we split up my unhealthy eating carried on			2
i just felt so low and the only thing that made me feel better was food			2
’ @entity7 ( pictured on her wedding day ) to her now - husband @entity24 @entity7 remarried in 2001 and initially dropped down to just over 11st			1
she said : ‘ i was keen to impress and my husband was very thin			1
he could eat what he wanted and never put on any weight			2
’ but it was n’t long before the weight started to pile on again			2
@entity7 said : ‘ the marriage only lasted two years			1
' i suspected he was playing away and i turned to my old friend - food - for comfort again			1
‘ before we split up , i would stash food in the bedroom			0
it was mainly chocolate and biscuits , and i would go up there and gorge on it while my husband was downstairs			1
' i ’d just eat and eat until i was physically sick			0
‘ by the time i actually left him , i was a size 22 and 18 stone			1
my self - esteem and confidence was at an all - time low			0
‘ i could n’t bear the thought of going out , so would just stay in and eat all evening			0
’ it was only after @entity7 ( above ) had her son , @entity48 , now 31 , that she began to struggle with her weight @entity7 ’s life spiralled downwards even further when she could n’t keep up with the high - interest mortgage payments on her new home			1
she said : ‘ my outgoings became more than my incomings and i could n’t see a way forward			0
' i ’d never felt as low in my life			1
i ’d gone through two divorces and my house was about to be repossessed			0
i ’d never felt as depressed in my whole life			1
‘ and just like i always had when i was low i looked to food for comfort			0
’ but @entity7 ’s eating habits became more extreme as she was unable to mentally stop herself from binge - eating through the night			1
she recalls : ‘ i ’d get home from work and the first thing i ’d do was order a takeaway			0
within half an hour of finishing it , i would start on stodgy cheese sandwiches , super-size bags of crisps and giant - sized chocolate bars			0
‘ i would then literally eat non-stop until i fell asleep			0
my stomach would be throbbing i was so full and i ’d often be sick , but even that did n’t stop me			0
' @entity7 ( pictured above left and right ) says : ‘ i ’m now 12st 7lbs and feel wonderful			1
i can go into any high street store and buy whatever clothes i want and do n’t feel embarrassed by the rolls of fat i was once hiding ' she continued : ‘ i would fall sleep surrounded by food			0
then i ’d wake up at 3am most nights			0
i called it my " witching hour " – it ’s when i would start eating again			0
i would literally much through anything i could get my hands on , but it was generally more goodies			0
‘ i ’d drop back off about 5am			0
by the time i got up for work , my stomach felt like lead			0
i felt so ill i would n’t be able to eat all day – but the cycle would carry on when i got home of an evening			0
’ @entity7 ’s compulsive overeating carried on for two years			1
she said : ‘ logically i knew i was doing myself so much harm , but i just could n’t break the cycle			0
my mood was very low and i could n’t see a way out			0
‘ i was also aware that i was spending up to £ 100 a week on takeaways which could go towards my mortgage payments , that works out at £ 20,000 over four years , but not even that was enough to stop me almost eating myself to death			1
‘ i ballooned to a size 32 and weighed a staggering 28 stone			1
i could only wear skirts and trousers with elasticated waists and baggy tops			0
it was utterly soul destroying			0
’ in january 2010 , @entity7 finally lost her home after the bank repossessed it and with even more mounting debts , she declared herself bankrupt			1
@entity7 won @entity181 's ' slimmer of the year ' ‘ you ca n’t get much lower , ’ she says			1
‘ i ’d all but given up on life			2
’ but a few months later , @entity7 met her husband , @entity24 , 65			1
she recalls : ‘ he is such a caring man and accepted me for who i was			0
he did n’t care how big i was or what i ate – he simply loved me			0
‘ so after we moved in together , i carried on eating ridiculously and squirrelling food up to the bedroom to eat in secret			0
' i know @entity24 would n’t have been bothered by what i ate , but i was embarrassed and did n’t want him to see how addicted to food i really was			1
‘ but after two years , i was at breaking point again			0
one night @entity24 came home and i burst into tears , i was so unhappy by my eating			1
i just cried and cried for hours			0
‘ @entity24 did his best to comfort me , but i knew i had to do something before i ended up with huge medical problems			1
‘ it was like a light switch had suddenly been turned on in my mind			2
‘ the following day , i contacted @entity181 again , who i ’d lost weight with in the past			0
the owner @entity206 came out to see me straight away			0
when she weighed me i was 27 stone 12lbs – three times what i ’d once been			2
’ immediately @entity7 gave up takeaways , chocolates , crisps , biscuits and her ultimate guilty pleasure – stodgy butter - laden cheese sandwiches			1
she says : ‘ for the first time in years , i actually had three square healthy meals			0
i ’d have eggs for breakfast , salad for lunch and chicken and vegetables for dinner			0
‘ at the end of the first week , i ’d lost 8lbs and after a month i had shed 18lbs			0
i stopped suffering from stomach cramps and my energy levels increased , as did my self - esteem			0
i stopped feeling so depressed and sorry for myself and actually looked forward to the day ahead			0
‘ @entity24 was wonderfully supportive , encouraging me every step of the way			1
he ’d eat what i ate just to help me			0
’ in just two years @entity7 lost an incredible 15st 7lbs , dropping from a size 32 to a trim size 14			1
she says : ‘ i ’m now 12st 7lbs and feel wonderful			1
i can go into any high street store and buy whatever clothes i want and do n’t feel embarrassed by the rolls of fat i was once hiding under baggy clothes			0
‘ i feel repulsed now when i think about what i used to eat – it was absolutely disgusting			0
i literally ate like a pig ! ‘ but now as i pull on my skinny jeans and tight fitting top it ’s just the inspiration i need never to binge eat ever again			0
