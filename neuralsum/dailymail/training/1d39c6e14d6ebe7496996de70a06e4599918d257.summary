i just wish that i had n't			0
' but still concerned at 27 weeks , mrs @entity6 explained : ' i listened at home on my @entity110 device , which you are not supposed to do , and we listened to the heartbeat and i thought it was slowing			1
' she returned to hospital on april 17 , 2010 , where staff performed a @entity75 and two ultrasounds which showed the baby had restricted growth and poor blood flow through the baby 's umbilical cord			1
' it was about 1am and they said they were going to call a consultant			0
i know there was something wrong			0
the consultant scanned me and kept asking if my dates were wrong			0
he said there was a problem with the blood flow			0
' they admitted me and i did n't sleep at all			0
i could n't feel her moving			0
they took me to a scan and the baby 's fingers were moving and the consultant said it looked like there had been an improvement			2

' mrs @entity6 then readmitted herself because of the continued lack of foetal movements , and another ultrasound was performed that same day			1
she had seen three different consultants at @entity8			1
on april 20 they were transferred to @entity160 for another scan and a @entity75			0
she said : ' we drove ourselves to @entity163 and i felt like they were waiting for the baby to die			2
they did n't even give us an ambulance			0
' they were getting me to sign things and preparing me for surgery and were getting ready to spray me with the epidural and her heart started to slow down			0
' it was @entity7 who had to tell me that she had n't made it			1
she still had a heartbeat but it stopped during the delivery			0
it was all really quick			0
' but the baby 's heart rate started to drop as mrs @entity6 was prepared for an emergency c - section			1
@entity20 was delivered by emergency caesarean and could not be resuscitated			0
she said : ' there is just a catalogue of mistakes that ended up costing my daughters life			0
waking up in theatre was a dividing line to my life before and after my child dying			0
' mrs @entity6 said the couple have since used their compensation for three more rounds of @entity16 treatment - sadly suffering two miscarriages in 2011 and 2012			1
now they 're urging others to speak out to make sure the same mistakes do n't happen again the couple decided to take legal action and @entity205 have now agreed to pay an undisclosed amount after admitting that had they performed a @entity75 scan after her 20 week scan , @entity20 would , on the balance of probabilities , have been born alive			1

now the couple urging others to speak out to make sure the same mistakes do n't happen again			2
' it 's important that people speak out			0
the @entity3 is being pushed to its limits and if you keep pushing them then mistakes will happen			0
' if people do n't speak up then nothing changes			0
' @entity223 , a specialist medical lawyer at @entity30 's @entity163 office , representing the couple , said : ' this is a tragic case that has left @entity6 and @entity7 absolutely devastated by the loss of their longed - for daughter @entity20			1
they have both found it incredibly difficult to accept what happened and they have needed extensive support to help them come to terms with their loss			0
' what is clear is that the midwives made a number of errors and failed to detect and act upon basic signs which highlighted things were not right and ultimately led to @entity20 being stillborn			1
' whilst we welcome the admission of liability from the @entity205 and settlement , it remains very difficult and painful for the family to come to terms with the fact @entity20 's death could have been avoided			0
' @entity205 have been contacted for a comment .			0
