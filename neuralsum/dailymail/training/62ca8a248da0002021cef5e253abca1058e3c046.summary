@entity0 traced the history of @entity2 by examining genetic samples from humans and chimps a new book claims the @entity2 epidemic began in a rainforest in southeastern @entity9 in 1908 and not more than 70 years later when the virus started to be recognized in the early 1980s			1
for the book , which is subtitled ' how @entity2 emerged from an @entity13 forest ' , @entity0 traced the history of @entity2 by examining genetic samples from humans and chimps			1
his led him to believe the birthplace of the epidemic was the southeastern edge of @entity9 sometime around 1908			1
@entity0 theorizes that a hunter in the rainforest was infected with a immunodeficiency virus similar to @entity21 by a chimp he killed and butchered , the @entity17 reported			1
the hunter likely infected at least one other person through sex and the virus continued to make its way down the @entity28 in that matter until it reached the city of @entity31 ( now @entity31 ) in the @entity32			1
after reaching the @entity32 , the virus spread even faster via the continued re-use of hypodermic syringes at health clinics			1
treatment for a common ailment in the area at the time required 36 injections over three years and most needles were used over and over			0
@entity0 wrote : ' once the reusable needles and syringes had put the virus into enough people — say , several hundred — it would n't come to a dead end , it would n't burn out , and sexual transmission could do the rest			1
' @entity52 - speaking @entity51 who were working in the @entity32 went home after @entity55 gave up the colony in 1950			0
@entity0 added : ' someone brought back to @entity51 , along with @entity32 memories , a dose of @entity21 - 1 , @entity60 , @entity61 ' the re-use of needles allowed the virus to spread in @entity51 and an infected person or infected container of blood plasma likely brought @entity2 to @entity68 ' in 1969 , plus or minus about three years '			1
@entity0 wrote : ' it reached hemophiliacs through the blood supply			2
' it reached drug addicts through shared needles			0
it reached gay men … by sexual transmission , possibly from an initial contact between two males , an @entity80 and a @entity51			0
since 1981 , about 78 million people have been infected by @entity21 in his book ( right ) , @entity89 theorizes the virus could have been brought to the @entity80 by a gay @entity92 steward named @entity93 ( left ) the book claims @entity2 originated in @entity9 around 1908 and spread down the @entity28 before reaching @entity31 , the capital of the @entity32 , sometime in the 1910s or 1920s the account contradicts the theory put forth in @entity89 ' history of @entity2 , @entity100			1
in his book , @entity89 theorizes the virus could have been brought to the @entity80 by a gay @entity92 steward named @entity93			0
he called @entity103 ' and hypothesized he infected at least 40 people with @entity21			0
1908 : a hunter is infected by an @entity21 - like virus after he kills and butchers a chimp in @entity9			1
1910s - 20s : the hunter spreads the virus by having sex with at least one other person			2
it gradually begins working its way down the @entity28 before reaching @entity31 , the capital of the @entity32			2
1920s - 50s : health campaigns to treat tropical diseases re-use needles multiple times and the virus is spread unknowingly via syringes			1
1960 : after @entity55 gives up the @entity32 as a colony , @entity52 - speaking @entity51 head home and bring ' a dose of @entity21 - 1 , @entity60 , @entity125 ' with them			0
1969 : shared needles at @entity51 clinics also spread the virus and it is brought to the @entity80 ' in 1969 , plus or minus about three years '			1
1980 : a @entity131 professor notices a number of gay men suffering from pneumonia because of weakened immune systems and @entity21 is discovered thereafter			0
if @entity0 is right , there is no way @entity93 could have brought @entity21 to the @entity80			2
@entity0 wrote : ' @entity93 himself was infected by some other human , presumably during a sexual encounter — and not in @entity13			2
' as evidence now shows , @entity21 had already arrived in @entity68 when @entity142 was a virginal adolescent			0
' since 1981 , about 78 million people have been infected by @entity21			0
the virus destroys immune cells and leaves the body exposed to tuberculosis , pneumonia and other opportunistic diseases			0
thirty - nine million people have died , according to @entity153 estimates			0
antiretroviral drugs , invented in the mid- 1990s , can treat infection but can not cure it or prevent it			0
the number of people newly infected with @entity21 over the last year was lower than the number of hiv - positive people getting access to the medicines they need to keep @entity2 at bay , according to a report by the one campaign .			2

@entity0 traces the history of @entity2 in @entity168 and the @entity28
he says @entity2 began near southeastern edge of @entity9 around 1908
a hunter in the rainforest was infected by a chimp he killed and butchered
@entity176 infected someone else and virus moved down the @entity28
it spread to many others *due* to continued re-use of needles at health clinics
