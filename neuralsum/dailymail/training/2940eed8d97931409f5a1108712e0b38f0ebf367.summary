by @entity0 @entity1 and @entity2 are asking mortgage applicants to prove the size of their pensions the over- 40s are now being told they are too old to take out a mortgage			1
some of @entity9 ’s biggest banks and building societies are asking older homebuyers to prove they can afford repayments once they hit retirement age			1
anyone who can not show they have a big enough pension will have their applications turned down			0
the crackdown follows new rules introduced in april which forced mortgage companies to make tougher checks on applicants , to ensure they can afford to repay loans			1
borrowers must already sit through 90 - minute interrogations , and provide months of bank statements and payslips			1
now some banks have gone one step further , with lenders such as @entity1 and @entity2 demanding evidence of what applicants ’ income will be after they reach the state retirement age – currently 65 for men , and 62 for women			1
they wo n’t be allowed to depend on the state pension , which will rise to £ 155 a week from 2016			0
they also wo n’t be allowed to include investments and other savings			0
instead , those who will be making repayments after the state pension age must prove they are paying in to a private or company pension			2
anyone without personal provisions will be turned down , or asked to pay off their loan before they retire			0
banks could also refuse to accept applicants who intend to carry on working into their late sixties , or past 70			2
the new rules mean many over- 40s will have to take out loans over shorter periods , if at all			2
they will typically have to borrow less overall , so they can afford the higher repayments on shorter - term loans			2
@entity64 , a director at broker @entity65 and @entity67 , said : ‘ there is no doubt it is harder for people trying to take out a mortgage now			0
' the maximum age lenders will go to has reduced substantially			1
’ under new rules introduced in april , borrowers must already sit through 90 - minute interrogations , and provide months of bank statements and payslips he added : ‘ if someone has a very physical job such as a builder and says they intend to work past retirement age , the bank may not agree to take that into consideration			1
’ couples with different ages will have to prove they can afford loans once the older partner hits the state pension age			2
younger borrowers taking longer mortgages in order to afford a home will also be affected			2
before the financial crisis , buyers could receive up to seven times their income , and borrow 25 per cent more than their property was worth with no deposit			0
many took loans which were interest - only , meaning they never paid back the capital they borrowed			0
other types of mortgages allowed buyers simply to state their income without ever having to prove it , known as self - certification deals			1
however , these became known as ‘ liar loans ’ because so many people exaggerated their income			0
these practices led to thousands taking out mortgages they could not afford			0
after the crash , a new regulator , the @entity115 , introduced restrictions to clamp down on the reckless lending that came before			0
it has all but banned interest - only loans , and forced banks to put potential borrowers through stricter tests			1
new rules introduced in april have had an immediate effect			1
the number of existing homeowners taking new deals has dropped by a quarter in the last two months , as borrowers have been put off by the daunting application process .			0

rules introduced in april see borrowers sitting 90 - minute *interviews*
but some lenders are going further and demanding *details* of pensions
