’ @entity1 also said the @entity130 was building the sort of society he would ‘ love to live in ’ with his family			0
but the father of four , who has spent years living off state benefits , said he would not leave @entity7 because he was born here			2

another suspect to be questioned was @entity173 , 32 , who was recently seen canvassing students outside the @entity175 , and has been described as a ‘ stalwart ’ of @entity16			0
@entity1 has been an inspirational figure for a generation of @entity22 extremists , including the fanatics behind the murder of soldier @entity182 in @entity183			2
he led @entity16 , which was repeatedly rebranded in a bid to evade attempts to proscribe its activities			0
members gathered under a series of names including @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192 , but their @entity6 mission has always remained the same			2
campaigners welcomed the arrests but said they should have been made sooner			0

his comments that @entity183 murder victim fusilier @entity182 would ‘ burn in hellfire ’ and calls for an anti-war march through @entity220 , the @entity221 town that honoured soldiers who died in @entity224 , were repugnant , but deemed not to have crossed the threshold for criminal prosecution			0

@entity1 has called for the ‘ flag of @entity257 ’ to fly over @entity301 and for @entity7 to be conquered by an @entity22 country			1

he was said to have been radicalised by @entity25 cleric @entity153 and hate preacher @entity154 at @entity333 mosque and joined @entity1 ’s @entity16			2
