by @entity1 reporter published : 01:17 est , 31 august 2012 updated : 01:17 est , 31 august 2012 a disgruntled investor from @entity3 spent nearly three decades trying to get law enforcement to help him get possession of his stolen car			1
and considering the car in question is a specific model of 1962 @entity12 of which there were only four made ever , it makes sense why he has not given up on the case			0
because of some detective work and the collection of verified owner 's certificates , it looks like said stolen car may now be in the possession of billionaire @entity25 chairman @entity24			1
because of its rarity , the car is valued at around $ 15million			1
rare : this is one of the four 1962 @entity12 @entity31 the one shown here was at a @entity34 car show this year the tale of @entity36 and his stolen red @entity37 is part @entity39 and part wild goose chase as it reportedly involves multiple resales , museum displays in broad daylight , and questionable car dealers			2
every wrinkle in the multi-faceted case was laid out by @entity48 , who had an lengthy interview with mr @entity50			0
current owner : billionaire @entity25 chairman @entity24 is thought to have bought the stolen car in the 1990s he sent the site documentation proving that he did , in fact own the car which was one of only four made			1
what also makes this particular style special is that it was the last front - engined racing @entity12 , making its theft even more stinging			1
the story began when mr @entity50 bought a 330 @entity64 from a mechanic and dealer in @entity3 named @entity67 , a @entity12 specialist who was well - known within the car collecting community			2
mr @entity50 stored the car with @entity67 , and it was stolen from @entity67 's facility in 1977			0
police documentation proves its theft , though it incorrectly lists @entity67 as the owner			0
using a third party , the car was resold to a man in @entity77 before leaving the country and finding homes in @entity80 and the @entity81 among other places			0
in those homes were wealthy car enthusiasts , one of whom apparently bought the car at auction for $ 4.7million in 1989			0
the highest profile appearance of the car came when it was displayed at the @entity91 in @entity92 , @entity93			0
according to @entity48 , @entity24 , the billionaire chairman of @entity25 bought the car in the mid- 1990s			1
while mr @entity24 is based in @entity95 - where he is one of the most powerful people in the country - he is thought to have initially left the car in @entity99 to avoid high import taxes , though there is speculation that the car eventually made its way over the @entity105 and out of @entity99 legal jurisdiction			1
the case is currently ongoing and has open files in the local @entity3 police files , in the @entity110 and in @entity111			2
proof : this is the record which shows the car was stolen while under the possession of dealer @entity116			0

one of the only four 1962 @entity119 @entity31 ever created was stolen in @entity3 in 1977
that racing model was the last of the brand to have a front - engine and is currently valued at $ 15million
in spite of police records *marking* the left , it is presently thought to be owned by @entity25 billionaire @entity24
