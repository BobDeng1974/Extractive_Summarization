by @entity0 the @entity1 could be banished from packets of @entity4 meat under rules proposed by the @entity6			1
the diktat would also apply to logos and flags representing @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12			1
any such move would infuriate retailers and farmers			2
it would also annoy shoppers keen to support @entity4 farms , where animal welfare standards are now among the highest in the world			1
restrictions : packaged meat products on sale in high street chains such as @entity25 's ( pictured ) will no longer be allowed to have a @entity1 flag on their labels the @entity28 has drawn up proposals for a standardised fresh meat labelling regime for all 28 member states			1
the plans are intended to help consumers understand the origins of what they are eating because of concerns that labels are misleading			2
but officials at @entity4 ’s food and farming department , @entity39 , claim the current draft scheme could have serious unintended consequences			1
while a pack would have to carry a @entity4 reference to identify where the animal was reared and a second to state the country of slaughter , all other symbols would be banned			1
this would stop the use of the @entity1 , the @entity52 , the dragon of @entity11 and the @entity55 logo , which is designed to identify @entity4 farmed food			1
the new restrictions would apply to all fresh meat other than beef			2
beef labelling has its own set of rules , set up in the wake of the @entity65 scandal			0
@entity39 is writing to suppliers and retailers asking for responses to take back to @entity69 to try to get the proposals changed			0
@entity71 , the department ’s deputy director of food and material security and standards , told @entity77 magazine : ‘ the draft proposals revealed this week suggest other voluntary information such as symbols like a flag would not be allowed at all			1
' crazy ' : industry experts say the planned restrictions on packaged products , including pork ( file picture ) , would cause chaos on the high street			1
‘ there are many examples where descriptions other than the member state are used , such as a flag			0
i imagine this will be a major concern to a number of states			0
’ he stressed that the proposals were not set in stone , and added that other countries were also likely to demand the right to continue using national flags and other symbols			1
the @entity106 said national flags were useful for shoppers			0
its deputy director of food policy , @entity111 , said : ‘ surely it is a good thing for products such as @entity4 pork chops to flag up their country of origin with something like a @entity119			1
it ’s not something to be vilified			0
’ she also believes that putting the country of slaughter as well as origin on the label is unnecessary , and could create confusion and extra red tape			0
country of origin labelling is supported by @entity4 farmers			1
at present , imported meat can be labelled as @entity4 if it undergoes processing in this country			2
in the past this has meant that pies , sausages and other products made here with meat imported from abroad could be labelled as made in @entity4			1
eventually , the @entity6 proposals may be extended to stop this scam			0
but farmers are concerned that the plan to ban national symbols is a step too far			2
@entity146 , of the @entity1 , said : ‘ we know that consumers want to be certain where their food comes from			0
it is critical that labelling spells out where the animals involved are born and reared			0
‘ @entity4 food is recognised for its quality and production standards			2
@entity4 farmers follow some of the most stringent standards in the world			1
it is important that their products are easily identified in the market place			0
’ the @entity28 insisted that the information provided by @entity4 ’s food and farming department , @entity39 , and the @entity106 about the threat to the use of national flags and logos was wrong			2
a spokesman confirmed that the @entity28 is drawing up new compulsory rules to standardise the labels on pre-packaged meat to provide information on the country of origin			0
this will be combined with a new regime for voluntary labels that will allow the use of flags and logos			0
‘ @entity28 has no intention of banning flags and other logos on pre-packaged meat , ’ he said .			0

proposals would also apply to symbols representing @entity10 , @entity12 and @entity11
industry experts *blasted* the plans as ' crazy ' and said it would cause chaos
would also annoy shoppers who *buy* @entity4 products to support farmers
