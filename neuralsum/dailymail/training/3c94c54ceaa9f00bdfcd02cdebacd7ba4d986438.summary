a senior coroner ordered an inquest into the 13 - month - old 's death after a hearing in october declared it ' unascertained ' a fresh inquest was ordered yesterday into the death of 13 - month - old @entity0			1
the decision means more than two years of official silence over the case may finally be broken			0
@entity0 died in december 2012 but the public have been told nothing about what happened to her or how social workers and police handled the affair			1
it follows a seven - minute inquest in october during which @entity20 coroner @entity19 gave no information about the circumstances leading to the girl ’s death			1
it simply found that her death was ‘ unascertained ’			0
@entity19 , coroner for the south and east district , did not refer to the events leading up to @entity0 's death and said the cause could not be ascertained			1
he said he was ' satisfied ' that the findings of a private family court hearing were sufficient			0
lawyers representing several newspaper groups - @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 - wrote to @entity41 's senior coroner for @entity20 , @entity42 , to argue the inquest was insufficient and therefore unlawful			1
in a written reply to law firm @entity45 , mr @entity42 , said : ' my own view is that it would be desirable for a fresh inquest to take place , not least so that conclusions as to how , when and where @entity0 came by her death can be recorded			2
' neither i nor mr @entity19 has power to hold a further inquest without the permission of the @entity55			0
however , it is open to me to seek a fiat ( order ) from the attorney general to pursue an application under section 13 of the @entity62 for an order that a fresh inquest is to be held and i will now be doing so			2
' there have been two arrests relating to @entity0 's death on december 12 , 2012 , including her father , @entity68 , 47 , who was questioned on suspicion of sexually assaulting her			1
@entity70 has passed a file to the @entity72 ( @entity72 ) to consider whether any criminal proceedings should be brought			0
a @entity72 spokesman said today : ' we have received a file from @entity70 on this case and we will be making a decision as soon as is practicably possible			0
' in a separate development , it can now be reported that @entity0 's home town was @entity82			2
high court judge mr justice @entity83 , who has dealt with family proceedings connected to the case , varied a reporting restriction order following legal submissions made on behalf of numerous media companies			0
last october - a week after the inquest - mr @entity90 noted there had been ' some concern ' about the lack of information available to the public about the death			2
explaining why he had not yet made public his own ' fact - finding judgement ' on the case given in the family proceedings last march , the judge said : ' as a result of the judgement further police investigations into @entity0 's death are now taking place			1
' a decision by the @entity72 may then follow			0
' in the interests of justice it is essential that this process is allowed to take place without interference and that any criminal proceedings are not prejudiced			0
' he concluded : ' the circumstances of @entity0 's death will surely become known to the public in due course but , for the reasons that i have given , limited reporting restrictions remain necessary at this point in time and the fact - finding judgement of this court can not yet be published			1
