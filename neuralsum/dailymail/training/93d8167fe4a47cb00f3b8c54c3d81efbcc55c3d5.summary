by @entity0 @entity1 congratulates @entity2 on his speech at the 2010 @entity5 conference - the two no longer see eye - to eye @entity1 has secretly admitted he may lose the election because voters oppose his stance on immigration , public spending and welfare benefits			1
a @entity5 document obtained by @entity15 suggests that he has also given up hope of winning over new supporters			1
instead he is pinning his hopes on ‘ shoring up ’ @entity5 ’s traditional working - class vote and declaring his own class war by smearing the ‘ toxic @entity22 ’ as rich and out of touch			1
the damaging disclosures are contained in a leaked copy of @entity5 ’s @entity26 strategy sent to all @entity5 shadow cabinet ministers			2
headed political strategy to 2015 , it sets out how mr @entity1 plans to win power			1
but it also confirms claims by @entity33 that the party faces an uphill struggle because voters find mr @entity1 and his views a big turn - off			1
one shadow minister said : ‘ this document admits the awful truth that nearly four years after @entity1 became leader , people do n’t trust him on the three things that worry them most : immigration , the economy and welfare			2
we are n’t even bothering to try to appeal to the majority of people			0
it is a counsel of despair			0
’ mr @entity1 ’s secret plan is revealed under the heading @entity53			1
it says the top three issues that would - be @entity5 voters care about are ‘ economy , immigration and the @entity59 ’ – and @entity5 ’s ‘ weaknesses are immigration , social security and [ public ] spending ’			1
@entity5 's battle plan that they hope will win them the 2015 general election the document also makes a mockery of mr @entity1 ’s public denials that he has given up trying to win over @entity70 voters who helped @entity72 ’s landslide win in 1997 and hopes to scrape into power by appealing only to the @entity5 faithful , about 35 per cent of the public			1
confirming mr @entity1 ’s secret so - called ‘ 35 per cent strategy ’ , it states : ‘ our solid lead in the national vote share , 35 per cent , is reflected in a solid lead in battleground seats , 37 per cent			1
this would give us a majority of 44 at the elections			0
to shore up our position , we want to gain an additional 3 - 5 per cent of the vote			0
’ @entity72 won the @entity89 with 43 per cent of the vote			0
@entity1 faced fresh pressure last night after one of his closest allies warned that he was failing to win over voters			2
@entity5 mp @entity2 – an @entity94 minister who helped mr @entity1 win the party leadership before serving as his parliamentary aide – warned voters ‘ do not believe that they are in any story that @entity5 is telling about the future of this country ’			1
devastatingly mr @entity2 added : ‘ if they are not part of our story , i do n’t know what the @entity5 is for			1
’ his outspoken remarks form part of a growing chorus of dissent over the direction of mr @entity1 ’s leadership			1
mr @entity2 backed @entity113 ( right ) – @entity5 ’s work and pensions spokesman who warned earlier this month that the party was being deserted by its traditional supporters in favour of @entity120 because @entity5 was taking them ‘ for granted ’			1
he told a political seminar : ‘ if you went to many of the people that @entity113 brilliantly described , they do n’t believe that they are in any story that @entity5 is telling about the future of this country			0
they can list lots of other people that they think are in @entity5 ’s story , but not them			0
’ mr @entity2 went on : ‘ it ’s not a matter of having a policy for this or for that , but actually including them legitimately in the story and saying you are part of the people that we ’re here for			2
if they ’re not part of our story i do n’t know what the @entity5 is for			0
’ yesterday , former labour cabinet minister @entity142 , who is standing down in 2015 , warned the party would be out of power until 2030 if mr @entity1 loses the election because the @entity146 would bring in changes to exclude @entity5			1
a @entity2 said : ‘ the language in this document is shocking			2
to talk of shoring up our vote underlines the extent of our crumbling support			0
' @entity1 says he is a @entity154 leader while admitting he is only seeking the support of a third of the nation			0
' nor should he be talking about toxifying the @entity22			0
we do n’t need to resort to smears , we need constructive popular policies if we want to win and win well			0
it ’s hopeless , we ca n’t go on like this			0
’ the @entity5 document , written before the recent @entity165 and local elections , also states : ‘ our target voters care about : 1 ) immigration ; 2 ) @entity59 and 3 ) growth			2
when growth is bundled with other economic issues , the priorities in order of importance to these voters are : economy ; immigration ; @entity59			0
‘ the @entity22 will try to frame the election in terms of our weaknesses : immigration , borrowing and benefits			0
’ the document says @entity5 ’s tactics must be to ‘ neutralise our weaknesses on immigration , social security and spending ’			2
mr @entity1 pledged last week to boost benefits for older jobless while scrapping them for young adults in middle - class families			1
the @entity22 claimed it would push up welfare bills			0
the document also says @entity5 must ‘ toxify more of the same under the @entity22 ’ , focusing on the ‘ living standards crisis , youth unemployment , @entity59 in crisis and “ the top running away with it ” ’ , a reference to @entity5 claims that the prime minister and chancellor help only the rich			1
the @entity146 said the @entity5 document was ‘ an admission that they have lost the argument and are resorting to lies ’			2
a @entity5 source said : ‘ @entity1 is an effective campaigner and we have popular policies , including a freeze on energy bills , a guaranteed appointment with your gp and moves to get 200,000 homes built every year			2
we are in a position to win next may			0

mr @entity1 believes he has no hope of winning over new voters
