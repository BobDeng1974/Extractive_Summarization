the increase in net migration was driven by a ' statistically significant ' rise in immigrants arriving in the @entity4 - up to 624,000 in the year to september 2014 from 530,000 in the previous 12 months			1
around 327,000 people emigrated from the @entity4 in the same period			2

' if the @entity4 's economic performance compared to the rest of the @entity105 had been poor , then we might well have seen net migration fall , but that has not happened			0
