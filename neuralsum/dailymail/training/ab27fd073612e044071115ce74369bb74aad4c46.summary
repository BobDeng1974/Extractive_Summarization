that ’s all it was			0
@entity3 1 , and world no 3 , played as a team over 36 holes			0
yet somehow , in the dwindling light of day one at @entity10 , it felt almost like a win			0
@entity12 and @entity13 were the @entity15 ’s marquee pairing			1
they were @entity18 ’s banker , without equal in either team on current form			0
yet standing on the 17th tee , they were two down with two to play , having already lost their morning session			1
@entity13 was staring at the worst day of his life as a @entity15 player			1
he had been sent out morning and afternoon on nine previous occasions and had never drawn a blank			0
now it was a real possibility			0
@entity12 ( right ) and @entity13 celebrate with a high five as the pair salvage half a point on friday @entity13 ( right ) and @entity12 managed to salvage half a point for @entity34 against their @entity36 opponents @entity12 and @entity13 were n't at their best for @entity34 as they took just half a point against @entity36 this shows why starting right is always a good idea ! his shot at 17 was reasonable , then , but not exceptional			1
it made the green of the 194 - yard par three , but with plenty left			0
right to left , hole on a different tier			0
@entity12 , now playing the alternate shot , had it all to do			2
and , frankly , @entity12 had n’t been doing much all day			1
possibly the putt of the day , due to its complexity			0
so @entity34 were still in the game , heading down the last			2
@entity12 , buoyed , took out his new prototype driver			2
so called , one might suspect , because it had been a steaming nuisance all afternoon			0
yet it was @entity36 captain @entity63 who said that golf was not meant to be a fair game , and here was proof of it			2
@entity12 went savagely right , but good fortune intervened , gave him a handy rebound off a pine tree and a lie for @entity13 that was far better than deserved			1
he played his best shot of the round , perhaps of the day , a three - wood out of the rough to the back off the green			2
@entity12 sprinted across the fairway to celebrate			2
@entity36 , meanwhile , found sand at the front			2
they bogeyed , @entity34 got down in two to win the hole and the game was halved			2
viewed dispassionately it was a poor return from @entity34 ’s strongest pairing			2
in that moment , however , it was the catalyst for much rejoicing			0
when @entity87 , five times a major winner , begins checking his green maps while standing over a three foot putt , it is fair to assume he is feeling a little tense			2
even on the first morning of the first day , the @entity15 has that effect			2
it is no respecter of reputations , of grand slams , of world rankings			0
it plays by different rules			0
it makes heroes of less than stratospheric talents like @entity102 , and fools of all - time greats like @entity105			1
so , really , the thought that @entity12 and @entity13 would sweep all before them simply because they are better than just about everyone else here , is bunkum			1
@entity12 and @entity13 were in buoyant mood on friday evening after the day 's play had ended @entity12 and @entity13 joke around in a friday evening press conference after the day 's play had ended 7.35am : @entity114 and @entity117 v @entity115 and @entity118 7.50am : @entity121 and @entity122 v @entity119 and @entity123 8.05am : @entity124 and @entity126 v @entity125 and @entity127 8.20am : @entity12 and @entity102 v @entity128 and @entity129 @entity131 pairings sure enough , while @entity13 turned the air blue on the 15th tee , he did not have the same impact on the board			1
@entity34 are in the box seat , leading 5 - 3 after day one , but @entity12 and @entity13 ’s contribution was as small as it could be			1
they lost the morning fourball to @entity87 and @entity140 , halved the foursome with @entity129 and @entity128			1
so much for the dream team , then			0
@entity12 was largely ineffectual , @entity13 erratic			1
even when put in good positions he failed to take advantage , and he left @entity145 in trouble too many times to mention			0
the 15th , when @entity13 ’s language captured his feelings as emotively as his grim visage , was a case in point			1
with the pair ’s second shot , @entity12 could do no more than bludgeon the ball back onto the fairway			2
in his head , he was perhaps uttering a few colourful phrases of his own			0
if there was a hangover from the morning session , it was perhaps understandable			1
@entity34 golfers no longer choke on the last hole in @entity167			0
at @entity169 two years ago , 12 matches went down the 18th and @entity34 collected nine - and - a - half points from those encounters			1
so when @entity87 sank his tiddler winning putt after neither of @entity34 ’s prime partnership had reached a par - five green in regulation three , it would have sent a disturbing and unfamiliar shiver through the home camp			1
@entity13 had chipped worryingly from rough into a bunker , but by then @entity18 had already named his pairings for the foursomes , with both men retained as a team			1
had they bombed a second time it would have felt like a tactical error , even if @entity34 would still have had their noses in front			0
@entity13 swings during friday morning 's defeat against @entity36 's @entity140 and @entity87 @entity12 finds himself in a corner during @entity34 's loss to @entity36 's @entity140 and @entity87 @entity34 started friday morning frustratingly but managed to claw their way back to earn a two - point lead without doubt , @entity18 was looking to this duo as standard - bearers			1
yet , largely , the standard was poor			0
@entity87 and @entity140 were hardly bringing their a game either , as evidenced by their foursomes defeat later in the day			1
so the morning fourball was definitely a game @entity34 could have won had @entity12 , in particular , delivered even an approximation of the ability that has taken him to the pinnacle of golf ’s rankings			1
instead , @entity36 were allowed to clean up at the death			0
@entity34 led by a hole coming away from the 15th , but @entity140 eagled the 16th and @entity87 did the rest			1
‘ @entity218 and break him , ’ was the instruction of @entity214 , the last @entity36 captain to win the @entity15 — and the afternoon session showed how close @entity63 ’s players came to doing that			2
at the very least , it is hard to see how @entity13 and @entity12 could have remained together at any stage on saturday had they drawn a duck egg from close to 12 hours of golf on friday			1
not that @entity87 and @entity140 are a weak unit			1
by the end of the morning session , they had become the first @entity36 pair since @entity229 and @entity230 in 1979 to win four @entity15 games straight			1
yet the golf played on friday did not have to be from the stars			0
high afternoon winds and higher anxiety saw to that and anyone expecting a masterclass from players of such pedigree would have left this corner of @entity242 sorely disappointed			0
@entity13 and @entity12 will not be paired for saturday morning 's fourballs in the @entity244 afternoon foursomes scores 1315 : @entity121 and @entity122 vs @entity119 and @entity246 after 18 1330 : @entity114 and @entity117 vs @entity123 and @entity247 - @entity34 win 2 & 1 1421 : @entity12 and @entity13 vs @entity128 and @entity129 - a / s after 18 1436 : @entity248 and @entity249 vs @entity87 and @entity140 - @entity34 win 3 & 2 morning @entity250 0735 : @entity114 and @entity117 vs @entity115 and @entity251 - @entity34 win 5 & 4 0750 : @entity124 and @entity126 vs @entity129 and @entity128 - a / s after 18 0805 : @entity252 and @entity102 vs @entity127 and @entity125 - @entity36 win 5 & 4 0820 : @entity13 and @entity12 vs @entity140 and @entity87 - @entity253 after 18 far from an exhibition , the morning session in particular was more of a dust - up , a bundle in the playground			1
the match fluctuated because the performances fluctuated , and wildly			0
@entity12 played the first hole like the world no 1 , and the second like a player 500 places his inferior			0
he made precious few interventions worthy of his reputation , winning the 13th and 15th holes , to take the game from two down to all square , but on both occasions with straightforward pars to @entity36 bogeys			2
perhaps this was why , with so many great players struggling to find form , the residue of the last few days was forgotten			0
there was none of the predicted needle left over from the phoney war of words that invariably precedes this event			0
was @entity12 still smarting over @entity87 ’s jibe about his legal complications ? it did not look like it			1
on the short buggy ride up to the ninth tee , the pair shared a back seat and @entity87 put his arm around the shoulders of his young rival , laughing			0
they were both probably in need of consolation at that point			0
the @entity15 does that to people			0
unlike @entity12 and @entity13 , as a contest , it does not do things by halves			1
@entity13 and @entity12 watch @entity87 putt on the 18th hole to secure victory for the @entity36 @entity12 and @entity13 wo n't be paired on saturday morning on day two of the @entity244 @entity12 wrote on @entity304 that he thought it was a great afternoon session for the @entity34 team			1

@entity12 and @entity13 take just half a point from the opening day
@entity34 's @entity13 and @entity12 lost to @entity36 's @entity140 and @entity87 in the fourballs morning session on friday
@entity314 ended all square against @entity128 and @entity129 in foursomes
@entity12 paired with @entity102 for saturday 's fourballs against @entity36 's @entity128 and @entity129 on day two of the @entity244
@entity34 take a two - point lead into saturday 's play against @entity36
