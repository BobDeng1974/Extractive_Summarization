furious parents have attacked a school 's ' ridiculous ' uniform policy after dozens of pupils were put in isolation for refusing to remove charity ribbons and badges			1
students at @entity8 , in @entity9 , @entity10 , were kept out of lessons today after they refused to remove yellow ribbons and daffodils supporting the @entity15 cancer charity			1
head @entity16 defended the decision , saying the school selected one charity to support each year and could n't be seen to prefer one cause over another , but parents branded it ' pathetic '			1
student @entity22 , 16 , said that up to 70 students from @entity8 , @entity10 , had been taken out of lessons ahead of their gcses for refusing to remove the charity pins @entity26 alerted a local newspaper to the student 's plight by calling them from isolation			1
she estimated that between 60 and 70 students had been removed from classes			0
the 16 - year - old said : ' we have been taken out of lessons before our gcses because we wo n’t take off our charity badges			1
' we ’ve got cancer badges and ribbons on our blazers and they ’re saying it is n’t part of school uniform and it ’s singling out some charities over others			1
' we ’ve been here about an hour			0
they ’re planning on keeping us here all day			0
it jeopardises our learning and we ’ve got exams soon			0
' @entity52 , whose daughter @entity53 is among those in isolation , said : ' the school is putting children in the isolation unit for wearing those flowers			2
' i think it ’s absolutely ridiculous - all it is is a little flower			0
' the majority of kids wearing them are dealing with family members with cancer and they ’re being told to remove them			0
i think it ’s absolutely pathetic			0
' the @entity15 daffodil appeal has been running every march since 1986			1
supporters are encouraged to donate in return for a daffodil badge or ribbon which they can wear			0
support : pupils were wearing these flowers and yellow ribbons given out by the @entity15 cancer charity during march as part of a fundraising drive which last year raised £ 8.26million last year the campaign , which is supported by the likes of actors @entity86 and @entity88 , helped to raise £ 8.26 million , funding 413,000 hours of nursing care			1
despite criticism , @entity16 , the head of @entity8 , said he was simply applying the school 's uniform policy , which was available online ' for all to see '			1
he told the @entity94 : ' each year we have a nominated charity which we call the head boy and the head girl ’s charity			1
this year it happens to be the @entity101			0
' a number of students have been wearing some badges which are not permitted according to the rules of the school , which are pretty clear			2
' when we asked students to remove these badges there has been a small number who have dragged their heels and said because of personal circumstances they want to show their support			0
' he said he has spoken to these pupils and suggested organising a fundraising event to support the charity , rather than wearing a ribbon or badge			2
he added that the school holds plenty of charity events , and has raised £ 1,000 for the @entity125 in the past year , with an open door cafe planned next thursday			2
he said the school was contemplating having more than one nominated charity next year .			2
