@entity0 was shot in the head while fighting in the @entity2 warfare is seldom out of the news nowadays			1
yet very few of us have ever experienced the horror of it			0
@entity0 , 54 – who is currently selling @entity9 , his barn conversion near @entity11 in @entity12 – won the @entity13 in the @entity2 when , as a @entity15 officer , he took part in the assault on @entity18			1
‘ i still love soldiering , ’ he says , carrying a slight limp and a withered arm as he leads me across the gravelled boules court at the front of the barn complex			2
‘ i ’d be back in @entity25 or @entity26 now if i had the chance			0
’ it is a surprising admission , especially considering the full story of @entity0 ’s last battle , on june 13 , 1982 , the final day of the @entity2			1
after a fierce firefight , during which he shot 14 @entity35 soldiers , he ran out of ammunition			2
undeterred , he then stormed the enemy defences , stabbing three of them with his bayonet			0
as he stood on the top of @entity42 , he turned to one of his men and shouted : ‘ is n’t this fun ! ’ at that moment a sniper ’s bullet hit the side of his head , blowing away 43 per cent of his brain			2
unsurprisingly , the following years involved some grim periods of rehabilitation – and also saw him write a bestselling book that became the @entity56 - winning tv movie @entity57 , starring @entity58 as @entity0			1
in 2002 , @entity0 and his wife , @entity59 , 55 , embarked on a demanding new project – which proved very therapeutic for him : they decided to site - manage the conversion of a derelict old barn			1
‘ it was not unlike a military exercise , ’ @entity0 says			1
‘ it was something to get my teeth into with a bunch of men and it meant leading by example , making the right decisions quickly			0
’ it was an ambitious project			2
the u-shape @entity77 barn that the couple bought for £ 680,000 was an ugly red - brick structure with oil tanks in the garden			1
transforming it cost more than £ 2 million and took 11 months			2
bad barn conversions lose control of proportions and scale – bits of spare space make rooms that have no obvious use , and open - plan design can create a furniture - store showroom effect			1
in 2002 , @entity0 and his wife , @entity59 , 55 , embarked on a demanding new project – turning a derelict @entity77 barn into the beautiful home , above the @entity97 ’ conversion , however , is a mixture of cleverly planned , functional rooms – kitchen , study , snug and library – in the right portion of the main building , leaving space to the left for the real show - stopper , jokingly referred to as the ‘ great hall ’			1
the main problem posed by the barn was the absence of any interesting features			2
they set about adding their own			0
today , @entity115 carvings serve as stanchions above the 17th century @entity118 doors in the kitchen			0
@entity121 - style stone arches add an ecclesiastical tone			2
@entity123 : £ 2.7 million location : @entity11 , @entity12 bedrooms : six ( plus three in cottage ) unique features : swimming pool , ‘ great hall ’ , fish pond , 2.5 - acre grounds there is hand - painted wallpaper in the downstairs bathroom , where , incidentally , @entity0 keeps his medals			1
the book shelves dividing the landing from the snug have all been beautifully hand - crafted and there is a bed from a @entity142 opium den where you may have expected to find a sofa			1
the attention to detail in the hall must have driven the architect , @entity148 , to distraction			0
at first , @entity151 oak boards for the floor ‘ looked too laminated ’ – they wanted broad boards with more knots			0
@entity156 boards were n’t right			0
eventually they found the perfect look in @entity159			0
who was behind such meticulous work ? ‘ we share it , ’ says @entity59 , a former actor and designer			1
‘ @entity0 is amazing at visualising space and organisation			1
i fine - tune the feel of the interior			2
’ the two wings to the barn also work well , as the bedrooms for the couple ’s children , @entity174 , 27 , @entity175 , 23 , @entity176 , 19 , and @entity177 , 17			2
there are yet more thoughtful touches – each bedroom has a mezzanine and the master bedroom opens on to a lovely little rose garden			0
the property stands in 2½ acres of grounds – and even and includes a separate detached cottage			0
impressive : the spacious ' great hall ' comes with a huge fireplace and @entity151 oak floorboards nowadays @entity0 , who has also worked in film production , mixes business interests in property with charity work : he gives talks to – and runs motivational expeditions for – injured veterans			1
the children flying the nest has prompted the @entity199 to look for somewhere smaller , and @entity0 refuses to be sentimental over the selling the barn , which is on the market for £ 2.7 million			1
however , just before i leave he shows me an email he has just received			0
it is from one of the @entity35 troops he fought against in that war of 32 years ago , addressing him in the most glowing terms			0
‘ i feel more simpatico to soldiers like that than i do for some civilians i meet , ’ he says			0
‘ i loved military life – the decision - making and the precision of it all			0
after that , the trivia of day - to - day life seems awful			0
’ it is hard to avoid the thought that wherever @entity0 moves to next , @entity18 will never be far away .			1
