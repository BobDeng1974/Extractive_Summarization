officials in mr @entity1 ’s department and the @entity14 both repeated their denials in recent weeks of any ‘ tip - off ’ that led to the new tests , which have sparked an international scandal			1
the @entity3 secretary of state for the environment @entity19 said in the @entity21 that the @entity14 was acting on ‘ local intelligence ’ – claiming mr @entity1 had personally confirmed this to him			1
the department and the @entity14 have maintained since the scandal broke that horse dna was discovered during routine testing and not because of a tip from a whistleblower			1
speaking on monday in the @entity21 , mr @entity19 said : ‘ the reason the @entity7 agency picked up this issue in the @entity7 plant was that it had local intelligence that there was a problem			1
that is why it did a random check , i cleared that with minister @entity1 today			1
’ in response to inquiries about mr @entity19 ’s allegations , a spokeswoman for mr @entity1 first said she could not comment , and then revealed that the minister had called mr @entity19 last night to reach agreement that this was ‘ not the position ’			1
she added that she had ‘ no idea ’ where the term ‘ local intelligence ’ originated			2

mr @entity1 has insisted @entity7 horses can not enter the food chain , saying there is strong traceability in the system			1
however , when an @entity130 investigation revealed that official records for @entity132 , an abandoned horse rescued in @entity134 , incorrectly showed he had been slaughtered , the minister was forced to admit problems do exist and the extent of confusion with the passport system is growing			1

professor @entity206 of the @entity207 said : ‘ the vet makes the final decision when a horse is dying			1
insurers may ask for a postmortem			0
they are carried out at the @entity207			0
then they go to category 2 plants known as knackeries			0
we document the number of horses that enter the plants			0
’ prof @entity206 explained that because racehorses often had to be given medicine , they were not supposed to enter the food chain			0
