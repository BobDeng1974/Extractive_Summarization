@entity0 has been accused of racism after it closed down accounts held by high profile @entity4 groups including two charities and a mosque			1
the @entity8 and @entity9 ( @entity9 ) , along with the @entity10 in north @entity11 , were sent letters , some without explanation , informing them the high street bank would stop offering them their services			1
despite insisting that the account closures were ' absolutely not based on race or religion ' , the multi-national corporation has been condemned for allegedly singling out @entity21 and prominent figures have called for a boycott			1
the 45 year old , who was born in @entity36 and came to @entity37 as a young child , said he opened an account with the @entity40 - now part of @entity0 - as a teenager with just a £ 10 note			2
he said he was angered by the failure of the bank to give an explanation for its action			0
' i am angered because of the wall of silence and the tone of the letter			0
it is difficult to take as i regard myself as a law abiding citizen who tries to make things better in conflicts around the world and tries to promote peace and dialogue , ' he said			0
he flew to @entity36 in late 2005 to secure the release of @entity37 peace campaigner @entity61 , who was being held hostage in the country			0
mr @entity61 , along with two @entity64 held hostage , were eventually released in 2006 after 117 days in captivity as the result of a @entity37 - led military operation			0
he added : ' when you are left with no explanation , you are left to speculate , from the whole context of the other organisations that have been targeted , i would speculate that it is because of my activism either for @entity74 or for the @entity75			0
' i have also been vocal in my attacks on the governments of @entity78 and @entity79 regarding their stand on the military coup in @entity82			0
' allegations : the bank have said the decisions are ' absolutely not based on race or religious grounds ' last week , the north @entity11 - based @entity10 , once run by hate preacher @entity88 , was notified of the decision to close their account on september 22			1
trustee @entity92 said : ' the letters that have been sent and the letters that we received do not give any reason why the accounts were closed in the first place			2
' that has led us to believe that the only reason this has happened is because of an islamophobic campaign targeting @entity4 charities in the @entity37			2
' chairman @entity104 added : ' the bank did n’t even contact us beforehand			0
did n’t give us a chance even to address their concerns			0
' for us it is astonishing - we are a charity operating in the @entity37 , all our operations are here in the @entity37 and we do n’t transfer any money out of the @entity37			0
all our operations are funded from funds within the @entity37			0
' local mp @entity114 also opposed @entity0 's move , saying he reckons the mosque has turned over a new leaf after now - convicted terrorist @entity88 was removed			1
meanwhile , the @entity9 was told its account will be closed after two months in a letter from the bank dated july 22 , in which @entity0 said : ' provision of banking services to @entity9 now falls outside of our risk appetite			1
' registered with the @entity124 as the @entity125 , @entity9 provides emergency relief such as food and medical supplies to conflict zones , including @entity130 and @entity74			1
it is not the first time it has had its bank accounts shut down - @entity135 did the same during the conflict in @entity74 in 2008			2
a statement on the @entity141 - based charity ’s website said : ' as the attacks intensify in @entity74 and innocent people continue to be killed , @entity137 has issued a two - month notice to @entity9 to close down its accounts			1
condemnation : the bank was also criticised on @entity148 , with one user accusing them of discrimination frustrated : another user said she would take action of her own following the allegations opposition : @entity157 , a trustree from the @entity9 , has called for its supporters to join a campaign to boycott @entity0 ' this is similar to what @entity135 did to @entity9 during the previous @entity74 war in 2008			1
a notice then was also served for the charity to close its accounts			2
' @entity9 reassures supporters that , in response , the charity will increase its support to the orphans , widows and injured civilians in @entity74 through its other bank accounts			1
' trustee @entity157 , in a video statement on the site , also called on its supporters to join in a ' campaign to boycott @entity0 '			1
the bank was also criticised on @entity148			0
@entity178 said : ' @entity0 is a racist organisation discriminating against people			2
another user , writing under the name @entity182 , added : ' @entity0 are a bunch of racists '			2
some @entity0 customers have even decided to voluntarily close their accounts in protest at the controversial new policy			1
@entity189 said : ' no need for a letter , @entity0			0
i ’ll close my account myself			0
' an @entity0 spokesman said : ' we do not discuss relationships we may or may not have with a customer , nor confirm whether an individual or business is , or has been a customer			0
in general terms , decisions to end a customer relationship are not taken lightly , but are absolutely not based on the race or religion of a customer			1
' discrimination against customers on grounds of race or religion is immoral , unacceptable and illegal , and @entity0 has comprehensive rules and policies in place to ensure race or religion are never factors in the decisions we make			1

among the accounts closed was that of @entity10 in @entity11
family of @entity8 founder were also informed of closure
relief charity @entity9 told they fell outside ' risk appetite '
high street bank has insisted the move is not ' based on race or religion '
figures in @entity4 *community* have told customers to ' boycott ' @entity0
