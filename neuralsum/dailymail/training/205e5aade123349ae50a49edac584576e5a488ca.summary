a skin test could help detect and research conditions including @entity3 's and @entity5 's diseases , a new study has suggested			1
doctors from the @entity7 at the @entity8 , @entity9 , studied 53 volunteers with forms of dementia to analyse skin samples for differing amounts of certain proteins compared with 12 healthy people			1
the researchers reported skin biopsies from those with @entity3 's and @entity5 's had higher levels of the protein phospho - tau compared with healthy people , while @entity5 's sufferers also had higher levels of alpha - synuclein protein			1
dementia currently affects more than 850,000 people in the @entity28 , but there is no definitive diagnostic test for it the preliminary results , doctors said , mean skin could be a useful way of detecting the diseases			2
there is yet to be a definitive diagnostic test for dementia , which affects more than 850,000 people in the @entity28 , and there are calls for more people to take part in research			2
dr @entity45 , head of research at @entity47 , the @entity28 's leading dementia research charity , said : ' these new findings are yet to be published in full and it is too early to say whether this preliminary study will lead to a new way of identifying people with alzheimer 's disease and @entity5 's			0
' this research would need to be repeated in much larger groups of people to determine whether this method could be used in future to aid diagnosis			0
' skin biopsies are already proving useful in dementia research in other ways , for example at @entity47 's @entity65			0
' human nerve cells can be grown in a dish from " reprogrammed " , donated skin cells to create a model of alzheimer 's disease for research			0

study from @entity74 at the @entity8 , @entity9
skin biopsies from those with @entity3 's and @entity5 's had higher levels of phospho - tau protein compared with healthy people
@entity5 's sufferers also had higher levels of alpha - synuclein protein
there is currently no definitive diagnostic test for dementia
