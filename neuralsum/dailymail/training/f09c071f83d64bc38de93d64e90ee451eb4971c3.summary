@entity1 fighters have released new photos of a man having his hand chopped off for theft and another man being whipped for watching porn			1
the graphic images , which were posted online , give the first indication of how the shocking amputation punishment is being carried out as @entity11 delivers its own twisted form of justice			1
the horrific sentence was carried out in the @entity16 border town of @entity17 , in @entity19 province			1
severed : this is the moment @entity1 fighters administered their own brutal brand of justice by cutting off the hand of a man who was allegedly caught stealing justice : @entity11 law demands that , after a trial , a list of the criminals ' crimes be read out in front of a crowd of men who have been invited to watch , before the punishment is carried out in front of a large crowd of men , the victim was blindfolded with a large patterned scarf and forced to place his arm on a table			1
one masked @entity1 fighter , wearing surgical gloves and a grey and pink striped jumper underneath his camouflage military vest , is shown trying to keep the victim 's arm steady			2
on the table , the victim 's arm has been stretched out on top of a wooden plank , covered with a white cloth			0
a large bottle of antiseptic is also positioned on the edge of the table			0
a rope is tied around the victim 's wrist , allowing another @entity1 fighter to yank the severed hand away from the arm after it has been hacked off with a cleaver			1
one especially grisly image shows the detached hand in mid air , still tied to the rope			2
@entity11 fighters also posted a high definition photo of the man 's severed hand showing that the amputation was not a clean cut , leaving bone and tissue hanging from the hand			1
a final photo of the victim 's stump being covered in a gauze bandage is also shown			0
typically @entity11 would also release an image of the victim hugging the fighter who has punished him , but this was not done in this case			2
punished : for the first time these images reveal how amputations are carried out			2
the victim is sat in a chair with a noose tied to his wrist ( centre ) which is used to pull the hand away after it is severed public : @entity11 law demands that all punishments be carried out in public , and a large crowd of men are usually invited to watch each sentence the vile punishment comes days after @entity1 posted photos of a man being flogged for watching pornography in @entity106			1
according to captions on the photographs , the man was found guilty of ' watching pornographic videos ' and was publicly whipped in front of a large crowd in the eastern city of @entity114			1
the victim appears to be in his early 20s and is smartly dressed in a red jumper			0
in front of a large crowd , the man is shown being whipped by an @entity1 fighter			1
as is customary in islamic state punishment propaganda , the final photograph appears to be a staged scene , where the victim is shown hugging the @entity125 fighter who has just punished him as an act of forgiveness			2
last month , @entity1 released a document on social media , explaining the rules of @entity1 penal code , which is being brutally enforced across is - held territory in @entity106 and @entity16			1
entitled ' clarification [ regarding ] the @entity133 ' , the document contains a list of the punishments handed out for crimes committed in the @entity1 , in accordance with the extremist group 's radical interpretation of @entity141 law			2

after the sentencing , the prisoner is taken into the centre of the town or city			0
men and young boys of all ages are actively encouraged to gather and watch the punishments			0
twisted : a medical team wait nearby with bottles of antiseptic and bandages to help patch the victim up after the punishment is finished an @entity1 fighter then reads out the charges found against the victim before the punishment is carried out in public			1
