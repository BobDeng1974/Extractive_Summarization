by @entity0 a four - year - old girl was left screaming in pain after biting on a sharp metal spring which was lurking in her @entity5 ’s ice cream			1
@entity7 , 22 , bought the pack of four @entity10 ice creams from her local @entity12 store in @entity13 , @entity14 as a treat for her children			1
@entity18 , four , and her brother @entity17 , two , started tucking into the ice creams as they walked home from a day out with ms @entity7 and her partner @entity22 , 31			1
ms @entity7 said : ' i used my instincts and checked her mouth			2
i spotted something shiny and fished it out of her mouth			0
' i checked her hand and the ball bearing was in the very bottom of the ice cream			1
she choked slightly and started screaming so i think she tried to swallow it			2
' @entity18 was very upset			2
she would n’t eat her dinner because she kept saying the food would hurt her mouth			0
' ms @entity7 said the consequences could have much worse , especially if she had instead given that ice cream to her younger son			1
she said : ' i was horrified , it is not what you expect from a little treat is it ? i mean it could have been my two - year - old son			0
he might not have realised it should n’t have been there			0
@entity18 's mother @entity7 , 22 , said the ball baring of the spring was found at the bottom of the cone and left her daughter screaming in pain ms @entity7 and her partner @entity22 , 31 , were walking along the street with their two children when the incident unfolded ' the consequences could have been catastrophic			1
@entity70 knows what could have happened			0
ms @entity7 , a full - time mother , said she also took @entity17 ' ice cream from him incase it was also dangerous			1
@entity73 & @entity74 , which produce the product , said the find was ' rather disturbing ' she said : ' i took @entity17 ’s ice cream from him and he had such a tantrum because he did n’t understand			1
' my partner @entity78 was mortified but he is glad @entity18 is ok			2
i am livid that better measures are not taken to ensure this does n’t happen			0
' a stray bit of paper , a strand of hair you can understand , even if it is still disgusting , but not something potentially life threatening			0
' you just do n’t expect it , especially from such a massive well known company like @entity5 ’s			0
' the couple have kept the spring in a tub until the matter has been investigated			2
a spokesperson from @entity73 & @entity74 , which produce @entity5 ’s ice creams , said : ' obviously if she has found a spring or a piece of metal than that really is rather disturbing as things like that should not get into the product			1
' we do take a huge amount of care to ensure things like this do not get into the product and all products have to be passed through a metal detector			0
' we will make sure the incident is fully investigated			0
