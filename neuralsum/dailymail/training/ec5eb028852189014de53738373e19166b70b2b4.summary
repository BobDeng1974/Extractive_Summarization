by @entity0 despite the differences in the way we look and behave , humans share 99.9 per cent of genetic code with each other			1
to quantify just how much data is contained within this code - both in the parts we all share , and how we differ - physics engineer @entity10 applied information theory to the complex nature of @entity13			1
using binary principles , @entity10 assigned two bits of information for each molecule in @entity13 , and converted these bits into bytes to discover the entire code equates to just @entity21			1
when multiplied by 6 billion letters , and divided by eight bits per byte , a physician claims the entire code contains just @entity21 of data this means the entire code could be stored on a standard dvd , and is the equivalent to around 6,709 books , or 300 pages with 360,000 characters			1
the smallest amount of information available is the answer to a ‘ yes ’ or ‘ no ’ , or ‘ true ’ or ‘ false ’ question			0
in binary code , this can be simplified between a 1 , for true , and a 0 , for false			2
computers use 8 bits as the unit of computation , and this is called it a byte			2
a human ’s genetic code is contained in a sequence of four molecules , represented by letters a , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity62 each can be encoded with two bits of binary information - 00 , 10 , 11 , 01			1
when multiplied by 6 billion letters that make up genetic code , and divided by eight bits per byte , @entity10 worked out the entire code contains just @entity21 of data			1
expanding this further , @entity10 continued that each cell in the human body contains this @entity21 of data , and there are 40 trillion cells			1
this works out at 60 zettabytes of information , or 60 followed by 21 zeros			1
furthermore , because 99.9 per cent of this information is shared with other humans , less than one part in a 1,000 is unique - and this small amount of data could easily fit on a floppy disk			2
alternatively , the code could hold 511 digital photos , if each image had an average @entity88 size			0
@entity10 posted the explanation on his @entity92 @entity91 channel			2
according to @entity10 , the smallest amount of information available is the answer to a ‘ yes ’ or ‘ no ’ , or ‘ true ’ or ‘ false ’ question			1
in binary code , this can be simplified between a 1 , for true , and a 0 , for false			2
in 1963 , the @entity100 ( @entity100 ) stated there are seven bits of information to encode all of the letters in the alphabet , including upper and lower case letters and symbols			1
computers , which need a multiple of two to function due to the binary base of code , began using 8 bits as the unit of computation , and this was called it a byte			1
a human ’s genetic code is contained in a sequence of four molecules , represented by letters a , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity62 each can be encoded with two bits of information - 00 , 10 , 11 , 01 - and when multiplied by the 6 billion letters , then divided by eight bits per byte , @entity10 worked out the entire code contains just @entity21 of data			1

furthermore , because 99.9 per cent of this information is shared with other humans , less than one part in a 1,000 is unique - and this small amount of data could easily fit on a floppy disk ( stock image pictured ) at its simplest , the theory looks at how messages are made of information , how they ’re different , and also how they ’re the same			0
for example , if someone wants to share an idea , they can email it , write it down , draw a picture , and speak it and so on			0
all of these methods are different , but the outcome is the same ; the information is shared			0
with language , brains are able to take words , or thoughts , and break them down into chunks , which are then externalised			0
humans talk , birds sing and computers use electrical vibrations			0
information , no matter how its stored and shared , can be measured using a fundamental process known as entropy			0
this is measured in bits , and the information - no matter how its shared - is made up of the same number of bits , just in different densities			2

the work detailed in @entity92 ’s video is based on the general concept of information theory			2
at its simplest , the theory looks at how messages are made of information , how they ’re different and also how they ’re the same			0

with language , brains are able to take words , or thoughts , and break them down into chunks , which are then externalised using symbols or signals			0

@entity216 was produced by @entity217 - based physics engineer @entity10
he began by breaking *dna* into the four molecules a , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity220
each letter is encoded with two bits of information , using binary principles
a human ’s genetic code contains 6 billion letters and when this divided by eight bits per byte , it equates to *1.5gb* per human
but , when multiplied by 40 trillion cells , this is 60 zettabytes of information
