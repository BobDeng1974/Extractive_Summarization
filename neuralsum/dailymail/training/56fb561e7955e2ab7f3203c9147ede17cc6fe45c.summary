by @entity0 last updated at 2:57 pm on 10th january 2012 shock : @entity2 said she was told her cake 's icing could be explosive of all the @entity6 regulations , this one really takes the cupcake			1
at least that 's the view of @entity2 , 35 , of @entity9 , who had the pastry confiscated before she boarded a flight in @entity12 last month			1
but the @entity6 is sticking by its decision to confiscate the treat			1
the @entity6 said in its blog yesterday that the cupcake was packed in a jar filled with icing , which is considered a gel under a policy designed to secure travellers from terrorists seeking to evade detection by using explosives made of plastics , liquids or gels			1
the measures were put in place as a result of the failed 2006 plot in the @entity32 to detonate liquid explosives on transatlantic airliners			2
the @entity6 said that the 1995 ' @entity35 ' by @entity37 bombing suspect @entity36 and 9/11 plotter @entity38 also played a role in the regulations			2
in that plot , the two planned to use liquid explosives in small containers to bomb aeroplanes bound for the @entity47 offenders : the officer said the icing on the cake , which was in a jar as pictured , could be classed as a gel , which are banned from flights , along with liquids ms @entity2 , of @entity56 , was blocked from taking the cupcake onto a plane last month when a @entity6 agent said icing in the jar exceeded amounts of gels allowed in carry - on luggage			1
ms @entity2 has called that ' terrible logic			1
' she claimed she had passed through security at @entity66 's @entity65 earlier that week with two cupcakes packaged in jars that were gifts from a student			2
but she said the agent told her that just meant @entity6 agents in @entity66 did n't do their job			2
precaution : the @entity6 said in its blog yesterday that the cupcake was packed in a jar filled with icing , which is considered a gel under a its policies ms @entity2 ultimately surrendered the cupcake , but said the encounter highlighted a lack of common sense by the agent and the ludicrousness of @entity6 policies			1
she said : ' it 's not really about the cupcake ; i can get another cupcake			0
it 's about an encroachment on civil liberties			0
' the @entity6 said travellers can take cakes , pies and cupcakes through security checkpoints but should expect they might get additional screening			0
@entity6 blogger @entity100 wrote : ' if something does n't seem right , there is always the potential you wo n’t be able to take it through			0
' passenger @entity2 was flying home to @entity66 from @entity108 in @entity12 the saga with ms @entity2 came a month after a similar incident involving the @entity6 , a passenger and a baked treat			1
@entity114 man @entity113 and his wife were surprised to find that a @entity6 agent allegedly helped him or herself to a slice of cake placed in his luggage by his mother - in - law during a holiday visit to @entity122			0
speaking to @entity123 on @entity124 , mr @entity113 said he and his wife found that a three to four - inch piece of the cake had cleanly been cut out , but have found the humour in the situation			0
he said : ' i thought it was funny			0
i was n’t trying to get anybody fired			0

@entity134 said icing could be considered a gel under liquids policy
