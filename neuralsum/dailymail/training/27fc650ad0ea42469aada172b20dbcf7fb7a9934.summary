@entity1 's deputy leader @entity0 last night accused a @entity3 columnist of ' victim blaming ' over rape			1
miss @entity0 issued a lengthy statement after @entity7 wrote an article suggesting drunken women were not always without reproach where there are allegations of sexual assault			2
the column , published yesterday , argued that too many women cry rape after making a mistake by having ' non-violent sexual encounters in dodgy circumstances '			2
miss @entity0 said : ' ca n't we ever leave behind the blame culture which says to the victim that she brought it on herself and therefore the man is the victim because he is accused ? ' @entity7 wrote : ' you can blame someone else			1
you can attempt to alleviate your own feelings of guilt and self - loathing by pinning responsibility on another ' miss @entity0 insisted : ' we 're talking about a criminal offence			0
if i leave a window open an inch and someone breaks in , steals everything i own and ransacks my house no - one would say it was n't a crime or that the offender had ' made a mistake '			0
' ca n't we ever leave behind the blame culture which says to the victim that she brought it on herself and therefore the man is the victim because he is accused ? ' her comments come after @entity3 columnist @entity7 wrote : ' it used to be that women who made stupid mistakes with men , who had non-violent sexual encounters in dodgy circumstances — while drunk or otherwise intoxicated , in the heat of the moment or for a million other reasons — did not wake up the next morning and decide they had been raped			1
' they took a shower , gave themselves a stern talking to , maybe told a friend about it , had a bit of a cry — and then moved on as best they could , vowing along the way never to end up in that kind of damn stupid situation again			0
' now , in our modern it 's - anybody 's - fault - but - mine culture , there 's a far easier option			0
