@entity0 had already made doctors remove the instruction once but they are accused of reinstating it ‘ in her best interests ’			2
the doctors say consent was given by the 63 - year - old ’s family – an assertion her four daughters dispute vehemently			2
patient : @entity0 , pictured with her husband @entity22 , was being treated in @entity23 in @entity24 when doctors issued not one but two @entity28 notices , apparently without her consent the family says mrs @entity0 , who was being treated for terminal lung cancer and a broken neck , told them that hospital staff wanted to ‘ get rid of her ’			1
her husband @entity22 has launched a landmark case at the @entity37 against @entity38 for defying his wife ’s wishes and ‘ acting unlawfully ’			0
mrs @entity0 , a care home manager , was involved in a head - on collision last february – just two weeks after she was diagnosed with lung cancer and given 18 months to live			1
she was taken to @entity23 in @entity24 where she picked up pneumonia			2
described as a strong woman with a ‘ thirst for life ’ , mrs @entity0 responded to treatment and was horrified to be told of the @entity28 notice , which stated that her family had consented			1

she told me the doctor had told her about the @entity28 and the decision had been made			0
i told her neither i nor the girls would do that to her			0
‘ we managed to reassure her we had n’t agreed to this			0
‘ at one particular point , she did say they were trying to get rid of her			0
‘ i told her not to be so silly , which proved to be a mistake			0
’ the order , issued on february 27 , was cancelled on march 2			2
her family claims she was then ‘ badgered ’ by staff when she was alone to make a decision about resuscitation options			0
