prime minister : president @entity8 ( right ) is withholding an invitation for @entity24 talks with @entity2 prime minister @entity1 ( left ) during his march 3 visit to @entity3 because the administration does not want to appear to be taking sides with the @entity2 election falling so close to the visit arrangement : @entity15 lawmakers and @entity1 ( left ) worked out the arrangement without consulting with the @entity7 or @entity33 , only alerting the @entity8 ( right ) administration a few hours before the @entity2 leader 's trip was made public the @entity7 said that as ' a matter of longstanding practice and principle ' @entity8 is withholding an invitation for @entity24 talks with @entity1 because the administration does not want to appear to be taking sides with the @entity2 election falling so close to the visit			1
' ... we do not see heads of state or candidates in close proximity to their elections , so as to avoid the appearance of influencing a democratic election in a foreign country , ' @entity46 spokeswoman @entity45 said			0
but the timing of @entity1 's visit also gave the @entity7 a convenient means of retaliating against the prime minister for his decision to accept an invitation from @entity15 leaders to address @entity12			1
@entity15 lawmakers and @entity1 worked out the arrangement without consulting with the @entity7 or @entity33 , only alerting the @entity8 administration a few hours before the @entity2 leader 's trip was made public			1

' the typical protocol would suggest that the leader of a country would contact the leader of another country when he 's traveling there , ' @entity7 spokesman @entity90 said			0
' that certainly is how president @entity8 's trips are planned when we travel overseas			0
so this particular event seems to be a departure from that protocol			0
' at the center of the maneuvering around @entity1 's visit are the high - stakes , @entity10 - led nuclear negotiations with @entity2 , a nation @entity2 views as an existential threat			1
@entity1 and @entity15 lawmakers , along with some @entity110 , are united in their belief that @entity12 should pass legislation threatening @entity2 with new economic sanctions if the talks break down			0

he is in a tough fight to win re-election in @entity2 's upcoming march vote			0
@entity1 's @entity169 is running behind the main opposition group headed by @entity161 's @entity171 , which has been highlighting rancor in the country 's critical relationship with the @entity10			2
@entity7 minority leader @entity120 said it was inappropriate for @entity70 to invite @entity1 to address @entity12 in the shadow of the election and give the appearance of endorsing the prime minister			2
