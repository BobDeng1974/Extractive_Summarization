facing the music : from left , @entity2 director of human resources @entity24 , @entity9 and @entity26 are quizzed pressure : @entity29 was grilled over why the corporation 's governing body did not know that payments were being beyond what was contractually required and on a humiliating day , the @entity2 ’s director of human resources , @entity24 – who signed off contentious deals to get staff ‘ out of the door ’ – was accused of presiding over ‘ corporate fraud and cronyism ’			1
@entity9 was grilled by the public accounts committee over the findings of last week ’s devastating report by the public spending watchdog into lucrative severance payments			2
the @entity46 found that the @entity2 handed out £ 369million over eight years , in many cases paying staff hundreds of thousands of pounds more than they were contractually owed and in some instances even paying them twice			1
the @entity51 ’s chairman @entity26 was also quizzed by @entity11 , who accused the governing body of ‘ failing to meet its obligations ’ by cracking down on severance payments years ago			1
he admitted the @entity46 report had caused him ‘ shock and dismay ’ but said there would be ‘ no legal effort ’ to force staff to repay the money			2
@entity9 ( second from right with back facing camera ) made the dramatic confession to mps yesterday a former @entity2 governor for @entity66 said chairman @entity26 should stand down over the debacle			2
sir @entity68 said : ‘ i do n’t think he ’s done a good job , there have been several serious questions about his judgment			0
’ in a dramatic day : in an extraordinary exchange with mps , @entity9 – who started as director general in april – admitted the @entity2 overpaid its staff and should accept the ‘ onus of responsibility ’			1
he added : ‘ culturally			0
i think we ’ve lost the plot , we ’ve lost our way , we ’ve got bedevilled by zeroes on people ’s salaries			0
attack : @entity86 , chairman of the @entity87 , told trustees they had ' failed ' in their duty to protect licence fee money ' i think one of the issues was there was not enough grip at the centre of the organisation , by the non-execs , by the executives			2
’ according to the @entity46 , the top ten severance payments – to figures including former deputy director general @entity102 and marketing chief @entity103 – accounted for 20 per cent of the @entity2 ’s total spend			1
mr @entity17 said : ‘ this culture appears to be one of mates , cronyism , slapping each other on the shoulder , arranging for huge payoffs – “ snouts in the trough are us ” , basically			0
‘ most @entity2 employees are not like this			0
they work very hard and they do n’t get big amounts of money			0
‘ there ’s this little super-stratum at the top			0
they are a small number of people who have been gouging the licence fee payer for quite a long time , and it ’s a very big problem			0
’ out : payments to ten top managers , including former director general @entity128 ( pictured ) and chief operating officer @entity129 , totalled £ 4.9million mr @entity130 , who chairs the @entity51 ’s finance committee , insisted he had ‘ no power to intervene ’ in the issue under the rules of the @entity2 charter			1
but the committee ’s chairman , @entity138 mp @entity86 , said : ‘ i think , with the deepest regret , mr @entity130 , you failed			0
’ it emerged the @entity51 had been told about two of the biggest payments , to mr @entity102 ( £ 949,000 ) and mrs @entity103 ( £ 394,638 ) , in a letter from mr @entity145 on october 7 , 2010			1
@entity26 insisted the @entity51 was not informed the payments were far in excess of what the duo were entitled to , adding : ‘ if you call in due course the previous director general of the @entity2 , i will be as interested as you are in finding out why we did n’t know			1
’ mr @entity130 also appeared to lay the blame at the door of mr @entity145 , who left to become chief executive of the @entity157 and is expected to give evidence before the committee ‘ before @entity160 ’			2
asked whether mr @entity145 had lied to him , he said : ‘ all i can say is on the basis of the information provided in the letter to the trust on october 7 , and the terms of that letter , and what emerged subsequently , there is some disconnect			2
’ mr @entity130 said he had ‘ particularly unpleasant discussions ’ with members of the @entity2 executive when the payments were made , adding : ‘ i thought they were completely out to lunch in regards to what they thought was acceptable pay in a public body			1
’ despite pressure from mps to recoup some of the money handed out to staff , @entity26 said lawyers had advised him it would be ‘ impossible to claw it back ’			1
miss @entity24 , who signed off mr @entity102 ’s deal , said she felt ‘ uncomfortable ’ with the generous sums , but added : ‘ i just wanted to get him out of the door			0
’ accusing her of ‘ spouting @entity191 ’ , @entity18 mp @entity190 said : ‘ this is corporate fraud and cronyism that you presided over			0

@entity11 claim @entity51 failed in duty to *ensure* value for money
@entity46 found @entity2 broke its own rules with big payouts
@entity128 received £ *470,300* ; one former executive gave his back
trust member @entity130 said the @entity2 was ‘ out to lunch ’ over top pay , adding there was a ‘ disconnect ’ between what former director general @entity145 told governors and the truth ;
mps targeted much of their anger at the @entity51 for failing to ‘ get a grip ’ on severance payments .
it emerged the @entity51 will not ‘ claw back ’ any of the excessive payments .
@entity9 admitted the @entity2 had agreed six payments exceeding £ *150,000* since the @entity46 launched its probe , despite promising to *cap* deals at that sum . another five are in the *pipeline* .
