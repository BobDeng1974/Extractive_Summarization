by @entity0 published : 09:03 est , 22 march 2013 updated : 09:48 est , 22 march 2013 it is a venue that was close to @entity3 's heart , and is among the last places the singer visited in the hours before her tragic death in the summer of 2011			1
now @entity8 's @entity7 is hoping to pay tribute to the iconic singer , by installing a life - size bronze statute of @entity3 on a terrace overlooking @entity13			1
the proposed sculpture is expected to show the late singer dressed in her signature retro style , with her hair in its trademark beehive			2
tribute : the late @entity3 ( seen left in 2007 ) was a fan of @entity8 's @entity7 , which is hoping to install a life - size statue of the singer ( an early picture of the planned tribute is seen right ) sculptor @entity24 has been commissioned for the piece by the @entity7 in partnership with the @entity27			1
a planning application submitted to @entity29 say the statue will ' show @entity3 in her prime , striking a pose beneath her iconic beehive '			1
as well as creating a lasting tribute to the six - time @entity37 winner , 27 , it is hoped the sculpture would serve as a focal point for fans travelling to @entity8 to pay their respects to the late singer			2
favourite haunt : the @entity7 has teamed up with the @entity44 to come up with the planned tribute @entity46 , the quiet residential street where @entity3 lived , remains the scene of fan pilgrimages nearly two years after she was found dead			1
' the artwork aims to capture the vitality of @entity3 and her music by faithfully rendering her beauty and iconic sense of style , ' the planning document states			1
' the design has @entity3 relaxing on the @entity57 gazing back at @entity8			0
the piece is carefully composed with naturalism			0
' her long flowing hair will be represented sculpturally with a touch of art nouveau styling			0
other important style and wardrobe consideration include earrings , dress , shoes and a rose in her hair , all selected and approved by members of her family			0
' ' vitality ' : planning documents submitted to @entity29 state that the sculpture , seen left and right in early images of the proposed project , would aim to capture @entity3 's ' beauty and iconic sense of style ' mr @entity24 has worked on several high - profile projects including the hit films @entity82 and @entity84 and the @entity85			1
the organisers behind the scheme have said they would not allow the statue to become a ' shrine ' , and a sign would be installed asking that visitors do not leave gifts or flowers			0
the sculpture , while visible from the road , would not be lit up at night , the application states			0
@entity3 supported @entity97 at the @entity7 in 2006 as part of the @entity99			2
if it gets the go ahead from @entity29 , the statue would be unveiled on september 14 this year - one what would have been the singer 's 30th birthday			1
pilgrimages : fans continue to gather at the late singer 's house nearly two years on from her tragic death the plans for the statue were first revealed by @entity3 's father @entity3 last summer , who said : ' @entity3 was in love with @entity8 '			1
' we wanted to have a bench in her memory outside her house in @entity46 , but there are so many hoops you have to jump through to do that , planning permission for one , ' he said at the time			0
mr @entity3 has also been quick to dismiss some critics who questioned whether a statue of the singer was appropriate given her high - profile battles with alcohol and drugs			2
' the reason why there is going to be a statue of @entity131 , hopefully , is because everybody loved @entity3 , ' he said			0
' @entity3 was a human being and she was a strong girl who had weaknesses			0
' he said his daughter ' did a lot for @entity8 , did a lot for kids ' , adding : ' why the hell should n't we put a statue up ? ' .			0
