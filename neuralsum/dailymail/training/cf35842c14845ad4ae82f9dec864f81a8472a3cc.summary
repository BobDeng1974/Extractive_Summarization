by @entity0 published : 05:23 est , 26 march 2013 updated : 06:44 est , 26 march 2013 a woman has been cured of anorexia thanks to pioneering surgery that ' rewired ' her brain			1
@entity5 , 36 , was on the brink of death after suffering a heart attack , two strokes and broken bones since the onset of the eating disorder when she was 15			1
by her early twenties she weighed less than a seven - year - old child and could barely face eating half an apple a day			0
@entity5 ( pictured with her mother , @entity17 , when she was 24 ) developed anorexia at 15 ms @entity5 ( pictured since her recovery ) lost so much weight that she had a heart attack and two strokes after all conventional treatment programmes failed , ms @entity23 , from @entity24 , @entity25 , was approached by experts researching whether a technique called deep brain stimulation could be used to help patients such as her			1
the principle behind the surgery is to block the abnormal nerve signals which trigger anorexic thoughts			1
patients having @entity37 are fitted with a neurostimulator - a device similar to a heart pacemaker , which is connected to electrodes placed in certain parts of the brain			1
the electrical implant is connected to a small battery under the skin in the person ’s chest or abdomen to generate small electrical signals to stimulate the brain			2
when switched on , the patient benefits from the blocking of abnormal nerve signals which trigger the disabling symptoms			1
the technique has also been successfully used to treat people with parkinson 's disease and chronic pain			0
patients having the deep brain stimulation surgery , as it is known , are fitted with a neurostimulator , a device similar to a heart pacemaker , which is connected to electrodes placed in certain parts of the brain			1
the electrical implant is connected to a small battery under the skin in the person ’s chest or abdomen to generate small electrical signals to stimulate the brain			2
when the device is switched on , the abnormal nerve signals which trigger the symptoms of anorexia are blocked , reinforcing positive responses to food			1
ms @entity5 said : ‘ my health had been deteriorating for years because of malnutrition and it got to the point where i was either going to die , or give the surgery a shot			1
‘ i was extremely scared going down to surgery , but i was more scared of dying from anorexia at that point			2
‘ in the operating theatre , the surgeon put a divider on my forehead			0
i could sense the neurosurgeons behind the plastic sheet working away positioning electrodes on my brain while a psychiatrist calmly chatted to me			2
‘ the psychiatrist asked me a series of questions , some of them about food			0
when i responded in a positive way to a description of food , it indicated the electrodes were in the right place			0
‘ it was weird having someone poke around in my head while i was awake , but i knew i was in the hands of some of the world 's best brain surgeons and so that took my mind off things			2
’ once the electrodes were correctly placed , ms @entity5 was sedated and underwent a shorter operation which installed the pacemaker - like power source into her chest			1
two weeks later , the doctors who supervised her surgery at the @entity120 in @entity121 , @entity25 , turned on the current which stimulated the electrodes in her brain , rewiring her thoughts towards food			1
she said : ‘ when the pacemaker was switched on , it was surreal how my thoughts towards food just changed , as if someone had flicked a switch			2
‘ suddenly the thought of eating a meal did n't fill me with anxiety or guilt			0
’ ms @entity5 experienced her first serious bout of anorexia at the age of 15			1
the electrodes stimulate the part of the brain responsible for depression , anxiety and obsessive thoughts as an adult she dropped to just five stone at her lowest points			1
even extended treatment at a ' boot camp ' clinic in the @entity151 desert when she was 24 failed to change her attitude to food			0
earlier this year , with her weight stabilised at a healthy eight stone , a moment of triumph came when she ate a piece of birthday cake at her nephew 's birthday party			1
she said : ‘ for 20 years i 'd sat at parties and watched everyone else eat cake , while i always passed on the offer			0
everyone would look at me in a sad way when i kindly said no. ‘ it may seem silly , but saying yes and being able to eat a piece of cake with the rest of my family was such an amazing feeling			0
’ she added : ‘ before , the thought alone of eating a chocolate and crisps made me ill. now , i can eat these things without feeling guilty and i enjoy eating snacks			0
when ms @entity5 was 24 she attended a boot camp anorexia treatment programme in @entity151 ‘ that 's not to say i am turning into a chocoholic , and i 'm careful about not overindulging , but having the freedom to have a chocolate treat or a bag of crisps is marvellous			1
' as part of ms @entity187 ’s on going recovery from the surgery , which was carried out in january 2012 , she sees a therapist and dietician who monitor her success and guide her in getting her life back			2
she said : ‘ being warped with anorexic thoughts made me lose touch of what to eat and what was good for me - it 's almost like i had to learn how to eat again			1
’ now ms @entity5 plans to make up for lost years and will soon begin studying for a master ’s degree in political science			1
she said : ‘ i missed out on what should have been the best years of my youth but i am now getting my life back together			0
i can hang out with friends and eat meals together with them			0
‘ when i suffered from anorexia , i hated my body image , so it put me off having any relationships with men , but this is something i feel more confident about now			2
‘ i have no immediate plans or desires , but the idea of having a partner and possibly family is n't off the cards , so who knows what will happen in the future ? ’ in a recent trial six women aged between 24 and 57 , who had been suffering from anorexia for between four and 37 years , were given the treatment			2
researchers based at the @entity120 and @entity223 in @entity25 used @entity224 ( @entity224 ) to identify a specific area of the brain previously targeted in patients with depression			0
the target area was given stimulation and three months later , five of the six patients stabilised or gained weight			0
after nine months , three patients were maintaining a higher weight than before the treatment started - the longest period of sustained weight gain any had achieved since their illness began			0
ms @entity5 underwent pioneering surgery to attach electrodes to her brain around half of the patients also experienced improvements in their mood or reduced obsessive - compulsive behaviour			1
researcher dr @entity248 , a leading neurosurgeon in the field , said it appeared to have a genuine effect on the illness			0
‘ the finding of improvements in mood and anxiety in patients who were still underweight is especially striking , in view of the well - known poor response of underweight patients to conventional pharmacotherapies or psychotherapies , ’ he said			0
there are around 90,000 @entity263 with eating disorders including anorexia , which often start in the early teens			0
a record number of 1,600 people - mostly girls and women - were given hospital treatment for anorexia in 2011 .			0

@entity5 , 36 , suffered from severe anorexia since she was 15 - years - old
her weight dropped to five stone and she had two strokes and a heart attack
in a final attempt to save her doctors carried out pioneering surgery
electrodes , powered by a pacemaker in her heart , were attached to her brain
device blocks the abnormal nerve signals which trigger anorexic thoughts
she had now returned to a healthy weight and is taking a master 's degree
