by @entity0 published : 13:12 est , 2 december 2013 updated : 13:14 est , 2 december 2013 media coverage of catastrophes and crime can put anyone in a bad mood			0
but repeated exposure to this news can also make you immune to a foul state of mind			0
this is according to research at @entity12 which suggests frequent coverage of a negative event makes you numb to sadness			0
repeated exposure to bad news could also make you immune a foul mood , according to research at @entity12 ‘ a bad mood is known to slow cognition , ’ said dr @entity20 , who led the study			0
‘ we show that , counter intuitively , you can avoid getting into a bad mood in the first place by dwelling on a negative event			0
' he added that if you look at a negative headline before work , it 's better to read the article all the way through			0
by repeatedly exposing yourself to the negative information , ' you will be freer to go on with your day in a better mood and without any negative effects , ' he said			0
the emotional @entity37 effect refers to the phenomenon where people are faster in responding to the ink colour of neutral words than of negative ones the emotional @entity37 effect refers to the phenomenon where people are faster in responding to the ink colour of neutral words than of negative ones			1
this could be because the negative words are either distracting or threatening			1
the result is that fewer mental resources are available to identify the ink colours			2
but the researchers at @entity12 suggest that neither explanation appears to predict sustained effects			0
they suggest that exposure to negative words can lessen their impact with time			1
the researchers found , after being shown the same negative word only twice , subjects were able to identify their colour immediately			1
the researchers tested the theory using something known as the ‘ @entity61 ’			2
the task involves showing a number of words and asking test subjects to name the colours that they are shown in			1
it usually takes people longer to identify the colours of negative words like ‘ terrorism ’ than of neutral words like ‘ table			1
’ this could be because the negative words are either distracting or threatening			2
according to both theories , the result is that fewer mental resources are available to identify the ink colours			0
but the researchers at @entity12 suggest that neither explanation appears to predict sustained effects			0
after the initial distraction or threat , people should be expected to return to identifying the ink colours of neutral words			2
but in a series of four experiments involving the @entity61 , the researchers showed that these studies are biased by a quirk of the test 's design			2
in most cases , people are shown four or five negative words , along with four or five neutral words , in the test 10 to 12 times			1
researchers believe the negative words shown to people in the @entity61 put them in a bad mood , but through repetition , the words lose their affective power the researchers found , after being shown the same negative word only twice , subjects were able to identify their colour immediately			1
on the other hand , when people were shown the negative words just once , they name the ink colours of neutral words more slowly			1
researchers believe the negative words shown to people in the @entity61 put them in a bad mood , but through repetition , the words lose their affective power			1
the researchers ' explanation was supported by a questionnaire administered to people after they completed the task			2
those who had seen each negative word only once were put in a bad mood and suffered from sustained effects , while those who had seen the negative words repeatedly soon snapped out of the bad mood			1
the participants who were in a bad mood also took longer to complete the evaluating questionnaire			0
researchers claim the study , published in @entity125 , has broad implications for understanding our emotions .			0

researchers used the ' @entity61 ' to demonstrate their theory
the task involves test subjects naming colours that words are shown in
it usually takes people longer to identify the colours of negative words
but the researchers found , after being shown the same negative word only twice , subjects were able to identify their colour immediately
