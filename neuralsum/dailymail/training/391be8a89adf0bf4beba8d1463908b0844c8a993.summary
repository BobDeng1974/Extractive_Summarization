by @entity0 published : 06:15 est , 15 may 2012 updated : 17:21 est , 15 may 2012 a mother - of - three was shamed into losing more than 15 stone after she was n't able to take a dream hot air balloon flight because she was too heavy			1
@entity5 was mortified when she could n't take the trip while on holiday in @entity8 with her daughters three years ago because her 27 - and - a - half - stone weight meant the balloon would be unable to take off			1
her size was further brought home to her when she saw a holiday snap from the occasion which made her look bigger than one of the massive inflatable balloons			1
grounded : @entity5 , left , was mortified when she saw this picture where she looks bigger than a hot air balloon which she was too heavy to ride on ' it was humiliating			1
there 's a photo of me at that time with the balloon in the background			2
i was @entity27 , ' she said			0
the experience prompted @entity5 , 48 , to overhaul her lifestyle and she became determined to lose weight and regain her life			1
' i took a long hard look at myself and could n't believe how far i 'd slipped			0
instead of eating burgers i switched to salads and joined a gym , ' she explained			0
transformed : @entity5 is now 12 stone and dress size 14 , left , after taking up exercise and eating healthily			1
she previously weighed 27st 7lb and was a dress size 36 @entity5 's weigh rose to 27st 7lb and a dress size 36 after she split with the father of her three children , @entity42 , 23 , @entity44 , 20 , and @entity45 , 18 , in 1995			1
her weight had a huge impact on her confidence and made her feel unsexy and ' ready for death '			1
' i was such a big fat blob having sex was the last thing on my mind , ' she said			2
' i was having a destructive love affair with food and used to gorge on biscuits and ice - cream in front of the tv			2
i hated myself and was ready for death			0
wake - up call : it was holiday snaps like this one from her trip to @entity8 which made @entity5 realise how big she had become ' my clothes all came from @entity69 because i could n't find nice things in my size			1
i did n't care what i looked like anymore			0
i had stopped looking in the mirror or wearing make - up			2
' on a typical day , the nurse from @entity76 on the @entity77 would eat six pieces of buttery toast or a big fry up for breakfast ; two portions of bolognese for lunch and a massive takeaway curry for dinner			2
but thanks to eating more healthily and taking up exercise , she lost an incredible 15 stone in 14 months			0
her trimmer figure also gave her more confidence , leading her to meet the man of her dreams - and have sex for the first time in 12 years			1
new love : the nurse piled on the pounds after splitting from the father of her children but after losing 15 stone has found happiness with boyfriend @entity103 , right now a slim 12 stone and a size 14 , @entity5 says she has an amazing sex life with new man @entity107 , 45 , who she met last august			1
' i have a fabulous man now and i have never been happier , ' she said			0
' i ca n't keep my hands off him and he tells me i 'm gorgeous all the time			0
@entity103 has even said to me , " give me a break , i 'm worn out " , but i ca n't help it , he 's so lovely			0
' i feel 18 again and must be the luckiest girl in the world			0
four years ago i was ready for death and now my life 's only just beginning			0
' more energy : the mother has never felt sexier since giving up fatty foods and meeting @entity103			0
