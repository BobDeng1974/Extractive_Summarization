by @entity0 published : 05:45 est , 22 september 2012 updated : 13:19 est , 22 september 2012 racing in petrol - soaked overalls and – with one unfortunate slip - seconds away from a fiery death , it was an age when health and safety had n’t yet been invented			1
the 1960s was also a time when @entity9 ’s best might earn in their entire careers what modern stars like @entity12 make in a month			1
yet for the daredevils behind the wheel , it was a glorious age – because it was the glory that drove them on to keep risking their lives			2
sporting hero : @entity21 was the first racer to win the world championship in motor racing and motor cycling @entity27 glory days : drivers had little protection from crashes as they sat in their cockpits racing stars : @entity33 ( centre ) , miss @entity35 1966 , with drivers , left to right , @entity38 , @entity21 , @entity39 and @entity40 escape : racing driver @entity40 crashes during the @entity42 at @entity43			1
@entity21 , the legendary @entity44 driver who personifies the glamour of the age in these stunning black and white images , was just one of a legion of stars whose impossible feats make today ’s spectacle look much more ordinary			1
winning : @entity21 took the chequered flag at the @entity53 at the @entity55 circuit the four - times winner of 500cc motorcycle - racing championships went on to claim the @entity9 crown in 1964			1
the 76 - year - old remains the only person to have won @entity61 on both two and four wheels			1
in an engaging interview with the newly - published @entity64 – a collector ’s edition book costing upwards of £ 2,000 that charts the history of the sport in 1,000 images - he said : ‘ when you look at the conditions i raced in , it all looks terribly fragile , but at the time , you believed you were driving state - of - the - art cars			2
‘ in hindsight , you realise they were lethal machines			2
‘ when i first joined @entity79 , i went to a place like the nürburgring where the car would jump and the chassis would flex so the fuel tank would leak in a number of places			2
‘ in 1963 , when i won my first @entity88 there , the tank had leaked and my overalls were soaked in petrol			1
‘ but we lived in a different age			2
if the fighter pilots of today were put into a @entity97 aircraft , they might have second thoughts about it			2
‘ but it was a question of what was available at the time			2
for certain , the 1960s were a little more dangerous than other decades			0
then and now : @entity21 agrees today that the cars he drove in back in the @entity104 were ' lethal ' meeting : @entity21 , standing , listens as drivers including @entity106 , sitting in striped t - shirt , and @entity39 in check shirt talk about race issues posters : publicity for the @entity113 race in the @entity114 and qualifying for the @entity44 @entity88 at @entity115 ‘ the cars were technically more efficient than the type of cars that had raced in the @entity119 , but the engineering was nowhere near as good			1
‘ you used bits of @entity124 uprights to build @entity9 cars and that was all a little bit marginal			1
‘ you had these very small emerging companies coming along and their concepts were more efficient but the safety did not keep up with them			0
’ indeed , the 1960s reads like a catalogue of sporting fatalities			0
no fewer than 14 drivers died in @entity9 races during the decade			1
despair : a distraught driver leans against the circuit wall after a crash which left his @entity9 car wrecked ready for racing : world champion @entity141 , who won the title in 1992 , talks to his colleagues in the pit dangers : dummies were used to test new safety features on @entity9 cars after injuries to drivers			1
fourteen racers died during the @entity104 medical man on the spot : professor @entity155 was called in by @entity9 boss @entity156 in the late seventies to lead the track side medical team to handle injuries to drivers none of this grim irony is lost on mr @entity21 , whose own son @entity163 was killed at age 18 in a freak accident at @entity43 during a @entity167 race in 2009			1
‘ i never believed for a moment i would lose my son , ’ said mr @entity21 as his red - rimmed eyes welled with tears			1
but , back in the 1960s when drivers faced crashing against concrete walls instead of cushioning gravel traps , deaths were accepted as part of racing			2
all that began to change with the death of scot @entity181 – perhaps the first driver truly to break the sport 's heart			0
powerful : @entity9 boss @entity156 and former president of the @entity187 @entity186 terrible burns : @entity189 was given the last rites by a priest after a fireball crash at the nürburgring in 1976 nicknamed @entity194 , he was just 32 when , in 1968 , his @entity195 hit a tree during a minor race and killed him outright			1
killed : the death of @entity199 in the @entity200 shocked the racing world only the death of @entity199 in 1994 brought a similar sense of devastation to @entity9 and its millions of followers			1
from then on mr @entity181 ’s great @entity207 friend , rival and one - time flatmate @entity106 dedicated himself to improving safety in motor racing			0
mr @entity106 himself quit five years later , sensing that he had pushed his luck as far as he dared			0
also pictured in a @entity214 - style snap in the @entity64 - which is covered by silk - bound clamshell case and is the largest ever record of the sport with more than 852 pages tracing its history – is the scarred face of another racing great , @entity222			0
he too diced with death – this time in 1976 – when he survived a horrendous fireball crash at @entity225 ’s @entity55			0
while battling terrible burns in hospital , the now 63 - year - old @entity226 was given his last rites by a priest			0
‘ that stupid priest did n’t say a word to me because he thought i was unconscious and all but dead , ’ he told the @entity64			0
‘ i wanted to scream at him , ‘ i ’m not dead			0
i ’m not f * * * * * g dead yet ’			0
’ incredibly , a year after his near - fatal crash , he went on to win the world championship for the second time			0
even more astonishingly , after retiring in 1977 , the racer made a comeback and won the @entity9 title in 1984			1
by this time , there were still characters in the sport , including his @entity246 @entity245 teammate @entity244 , who is also pictured in the @entity64			0
he won the title four times			2
yet the simple pursuit of racing glory were bygone days , left behind in the 1960s			0
@entity222 himself chiefly returned because salaries were soaring and he needed cash to fund his airline business			0
yet an era where sporting heroes are not cut off in their prime is surely worth it and few of the greats from decades past would begrudge them this right … even if it does mean @entity260 on the track .			0
