@entity88 ( @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity30 , @entity28 , @entity91 ) @entity88 developed into a formidable striker when at @entity89 , powering them back into the @entity9 in 1999 with 23 goals in 26 matches and then , continuing his fearsome ' little and large ' partnership with @entity97 , was top scorer with 30 in 1999 - 00			1

@entity118 ( @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity28 , @entity30 ) few adapted as quickly to the new @entity9 in 1992 as @entity122 , powering @entity119 to third spot and then adding 25 goals the following season			2
he became the most expensive player in @entity66 football when @entity120 bought him for £ 5m in 1994 but proved his worth by forming a deadly ' @entity131 ' partnership with @entity10 as @entity120 upset the odds to win the title			0

@entity148 ( @entity59 ) @entity148 's time in the @entity9 may have been brief but , mein @entity150 , what an impact he made			2
the @entity154 was a figure of hate when he surprisingly turned up at @entity59 in 1994 ; he was perceived as a shameless diver and had been part of the team that left @entity66 heart - broken at the @entity161			0
but all was forgiven and forgotten as @entity148 powered in 20 league goals for @entity59 , some marked with a self - deprecating dive celebration			2
his second stint at @entity167 , in 1997 - 98 , helped rescue them from relegation			0
@entity170 performs a swallow dive after scoring for @entity59 on his debut against @entity173 wednesday in august 1994 @entity148 only spent two seasons in the @entity9 but made a huge impact playing upfront at @entity167 25			2
@entity177 ( @entity27 , @entity121 ) let 's put his measly return at @entity121 to one side - a £ 50m price tag having weighed a little too heavily on his shoulders - and remember the best of @entity177 at @entity27			1
the @entity185 star scored 65 league goals in 102 appearances for the @entity188 - some feat - and was worshipped like a @entity190			2

@entity177 was worshipped like a @entity190 at @entity194 - especially after scoring in @entity27 's 2 - 0 win over @entity198 in 2009 having moved to @entity121 for £ 50million , @entity177 struggled for form in west @entity83 and that price tag weighed heavily 24			1
@entity205 ( @entity206 , @entity60 , @entity207 ) we all know about @entity205 's volcanic temperament , but let 's remember some of the glorious goals he scored during his time in @entity66			0
the @entity214 arrived at @entity206 for £ 4.2m and scored 14 goals in his debut season to become a real fans ' favourite ( that shove on referee @entity221 aside )			0
he scored 48 league goals in his five seasons with @entity60 , including the @entity225 in 1999 - 00 for a flying volley against @entity227 , still one of the best seen in the @entity9 era			1

@entity239 ( @entity55 , @entity121 , @entity240 , @entity207 ) surely one of the bargains of the @entity9 era , deadly @entity241 @entity239 was signed by @entity245 at @entity55 for just £ 2m			1
he would quickly repay that fee with 34 goals in two seasons before being being sold for £ 12m to @entity191			0
he returned to @entity66 with @entity121 just a year later for a club record £ 15m and again proved great value for money			0
his 23 goals in 2000 - 01 - including a memorable volley against @entity198 - made him the league 's second highest scorer			0
in tandem with @entity257 , he matched that the following season , helping @entity121 to the @entity45 final , too			0
@entity239 also went on to score 22 times for @entity240 in two years			2

@entity270 ( @entity51 , @entity198 ) the @entity241 ranks as one of modern football 's most prolific scorers and would have plundered more but for persistent injury problems			2
nonetheless , he scored 96 in 194 league games for @entity51 between 2004 and 2012 including a glorious airborne volley against @entity207 in 2006 that @entity277 described as ' the goal of a lifetime			0
' his best season for @entity51 was his final one – with 30 in 38 – and convinced @entity198 to pay £ 22m for him			0
a 26 - goal haul in his debut season earned @entity270 a coveted @entity9 winner 's medal			1
@entity270 scores a ' goal of a lifetime ' for @entity51 against @entity207 at the @entity287 in 2006 as @entity288 puts in a challenge @entity296 scores another incredible volley after latching on to @entity292 's long ball during @entity198 's win over @entity30 at @entity294 in april 2013 as the @entity295 won the @entity9 21			1
@entity297 ( @entity51 , @entity27 , @entity87 , @entity298 , @entity121 , @entity111 ) sulky but often silky , controversial but consistent in his scoring , @entity297 was the striker who refused to say farewell to the @entity9			1
he made his breakthrough at @entity51 as a 17 - year - old , helping them to their first ' @entity303 ' in 1998 and he was their top scorer the following season too before his first @entity304			0
after time at @entity306 and a loan spell at @entity27 , @entity297 's scoring ability persuaded @entity308 to break @entity87 's transfer record - then a mere £ 13m - in 2002 and he scored 37 league goals for them			1
he spent two years at @entity298 after a spell at @entity312 before moving to @entity121 for £ 15m , helping them to a @entity9 title and two @entity45 triumphs			0
@entity315 striker @entity297 scores for @entity51 against @entity120 in 1998 as @entity120 goalkeeper @entity316 watches on @entity297 joined @entity121 - having also played for @entity27 , @entity87 and @entity298 - and is pictured with @entity317 after netting against the @entity188 like @entity319 's facebook page .			1
