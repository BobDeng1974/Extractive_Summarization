a @entity1 teen at the centre of an airline bomb hoax scare has been arrested in @entity4			1
twitter user @ @entity6 , who calls herself @entity7 on the website , sent an apparently threatening tweet to @entity10 on sunday morning and within minutes received a reply from the airline saying her ip address had been forwarded to the @entity14			1
@entity1 police have today confirmed they have arrested a 14 - year - old over the incident , which saw the girl inundated with angry messages			1
@entity4 @entity20 tweeted : ' @entity1 girl ( 14 ) from @entity4 arrested after @entity10 threat			1
@entity24 @ americanair ' bad idea : the teen immediately regretted sending this ' joke ' bomb threat @entity30 , a spokesman for @entity4 police , told @entity33 officers in the city had launched an investigation into the tweet after it was reported around the world			1
but before detectives could track the girl down , she walked into a police station accompanied by a family member			1
speaking this afternoon , mr @entity30 said : ' police spoke to prosecutors to decide whether we could arrest her and , after some deliberation , we decided that we could arrest her and she has been arrested			2
' she is now being interviewed by specially - trained officers who are used to speaking to young offenders			0
' mr @entity30 said the girl has not been charged with any offence , but could face charges related to ' making false threats '			2
he confirmed authorities in the @entity1 were in touch with law enforcers in the @entity57 over the incident , but insisted the investigation was launched by @entity1 police alone			1
the arrest comes after ' @entity7 ' , the name used by the girl on @entity63 , tweeted on sunday : ‘ hello my name ’s @entity65 and i ’m from @entity67			1
i ’m part of @entity69 and on june 1st i ’m gon na do something really big bye			0
’ it was just a joke : the girl insisted she was joking and not from @entity67 , but the airline did not reply massive following : her followers shot up over 30,000 by sunday night the airline quickly replied : ‘ @entity7 , we take these threats very seriously			2
your ip address and details will be forwarded to security and the @entity14			0
’ the girl then pleaded with the airline , saying she ’s only 14 - years - old and from the @entity1 , that she ’s never been to @entity67			1
‘ what do you want from me ? ’ she pleaded			0
but it was to no avail , the airline did not reply			0
‘ i ’m so sorry i ’m scared now			0
‘ i was joking and it was my friend not me , take her ip address not mine			0
’ infamy : the girl claimed all she wanted was to be famous , but lamented finding the wrong kind of fame humility : the girl claimed she was too busy flying around in her own jet to blow up a commercial one problem solved : @entity63 deleted and @entity14 ' blocked ' the airline did not reply , but @entity63 users did			1
her followers shot from a couple thousand to over 30,000 by sunday night			2
she took note of the gain in followers			0
‘ i always wanted to be famous			0
but i meant like @entity110 famous , not @entity112 bin laden famous , ’ she tweeted			0
both the @entity10 and @entity7 ’s tweet were eventually deleted , and it is not exactly clear if any call to the @entity14 was ever made .			2
