normally when i 'm enjoying honey it 's spread on a piece of toast or spooned into a cup of tea – not slathered all over my back			1
but the skyline honey treatment at @entity10 ’s @entity9 is no ordinary massage			1
using a gritty paste containing granulated fruit and honey produced from beehives atop the luxury hotel ’s roof , it feels like the massage therapist is giving my back and shoulders the once - over with sandpaper			1
it may sound uncomfortable , but the spa ’s signature treatment is so relaxing that i almost dozed off a few times			2
couples who are looking for a romantic getaway can book a double treatment room at the @entity28 at @entity10 located within the hotel , @entity9 offers guests the perfect way to unwind with two saunas , relaxation areas and seven treatment rooms the skyline honey treatment is @entity9 's signature treatment , using honey from rooftop hives occupied by an estimated 40,000 bees guests can enjoy a relaxing drink in a quiet sauna room ( there is one for men and one for women ) before or after their treatments from the moment the therapist told me to take a deep breath to the moment i climbed off the table , the exfoliating massage soothed the aches and pains i developed from sitting at a computer for more than 40 hours a week			1
capped with a relaxing head massage , i emerged with my skin feeling smoother than ever before			1
from there i retreated to the sauna – there ’s one for men and one for women – before returning to my deluxe studio room inside the 24 - storey hotel , located in the heart of @entity10			1
relaxing at the warm , comfortable @entity28 proved to be the perfect way to unwind after spending a few hours in the cold			0
