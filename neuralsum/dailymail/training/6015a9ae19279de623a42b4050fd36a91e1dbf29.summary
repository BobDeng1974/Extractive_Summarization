by @entity1 reporter published : 00:00 est , 14 january 2013 updated : 16:08 est , 14 january 2013 suicides in the @entity4 military surged to a record 349 last year , far exceeding @entity4 combat deaths in @entity7 , and some private experts are predicting the dark trend will grow worse this year			1
the @entity10 has struggled to deal with the suicides , which defense secretary @entity12 and others have called an epidemic			0
the problem reflects severe strains on military personnel burdened with more than a decade of combat in @entity7 and @entity19 , complicated by anxiety over the prospect of being forced out of a shrinking force			1
@entity10 figures obtained monday by @entity1 show that the 349 suicides among active - duty troops last year were up from 301 the year before and exceeded the @entity10 's own internal projection of 325			1
@entity27 honor fallen soldiers at @entity29 , @entity30 on jan. 10 , 2012			0
suicides in the @entity4 military surged to a record 349 last year , far exceeding @entity4 combat deaths in @entity7 statistics alone do not explain why troops take their own lives , and the @entity10 's military and civilian leaders have acknowledged that more needs to be done to understand the causes			1
last year 's total is the highest since the @entity10 began closely tracking suicides in 2001			1
it exceeds the 295 @entity4 who died in @entity7 last year , by the @entity1 's count			1
some in @entity42 are pressing the @entity10 to do more			0
' this is an epidemic that can not be ignored , ' sen. @entity43 , @entity44 , said monday			0
' as our newest generation of service members and veterans face unprecedented challenges , today 's news shows we must be doing more to ensure they are not slipping through the cracks			0
' military suicides began rising in 2006 and soared to a then - record 310 in 2009 before leveling off for two years			1
it came as a surprise to many that the numbers resumed an upward climb this year , given that @entity4 military involvement in @entity19 is over and the @entity63 administration is taking steps to wind down the war in @entity7			1
@entity66 stands in her living room with a photo over her late son @entity70 spc. @entity69 , who committed suicide in march of 2012 ' now that we 're decreasing our troops and they 're coming back home , that 's when they 're really in the danger zone , when they 're transitioning back to their families , back to their communities and really finding a sense of purpose for themselves , ' said @entity81 , whose husband , @entity82 maj. @entity82 , killed himself between @entity19 deployments in 2005			1
she directs a suicide prevention program for a support group , @entity86 , or @entity87			0
the @entity70 , by far the largest of the military services , had the highest number of suicides among active - duty troops last year at 182 , but the @entity92 , whose suicide numbers had declined for two years , had the largest percentage increase — a 50 percent jump to 48			1
the @entity92 ' worst year was 2009 's 52 suicides			1
the @entity97 recorded 59 suicides , up 16 percent from the previous year , and the @entity99 had 60 , up 15 percent			2
all of the numbers are tentative , pending the completion later this year of formal pathology reports on each case			2
suicide prevention has become a high @entity10 priority , yet the problem persists			2
@entity107 and @entity108 hold a photo of their son , @entity70 veteran @entity110 , who committed suicide at age 25 in front of his father @entity110 is pictured with his parents			1
he raised a gun to his head after saluting to his father and shot himself ' if you have a perfect storm of events on the day with somebody who has high risk factors , it 's very difficult to be there every moment , fill every crack , and we just have to continue to be aware of what the risk factors are , ' @entity82 said			0
@entity130 , a military suicide researcher and dean of the @entity132 at the @entity133 , said he sees two main categories of troops who are committing suicide at an accelerating pace : @entity19 and @entity7 war veterans suffering from depression , post-traumatic stress or substance abuse , and those who have not gone to war but face troubled personal relationships , money problems or legal woes			1
he is not optimistic about a decline soon			0
' actually , we may continue to see increases , ' he said			0
the @entity10 says that although the military suicide rate has been rising , it remains below that of the civilian population			2
it says the civilian suicide rate for males aged 17 - 60 was 25 per 100,000 in 2010 , the latest year for which such statistics are available			1
that compares with the military 's rate in 2012 of 17.5 per 100,000			0
officials say they are committed to pursuing ways of finding help for service members in trouble			0
' our most valuable resource within the department is our people			0
we are committed to taking care of our people , and that includes doing everything possible to prevent suicides in the military , ' @entity10 spokeswoman @entity169 said monday			2
two retired @entity70 generals , @entity176 and @entity177 , have spoken out about the urgency of reversing the trend			2
the @entity70 had the highest number of suicides among but the @entity92 had the largest percentage increase ' one of the things we learned during our careers , ' they wrote in the @entity187 last month , ' is that stress , guns and alcohol constitute a dangerous mixture			1
in the wrong proportions , they tend to blow out the lamp of the mind and cause irrational acts			0
' @entity196 , spokesman for the @entity198 office of the @entity199 , said war veterans have faced difficulty adjusting to the less intense environment of their home bases			0
others struggle with leaving the military in search of work in a tight civilian job market			0
' it 's difficult to come back from a war footing to garrison life , ' he said , where more mundane problems intrude on troops who had been focused almost entirely on their war mission			0
suicides in the @entity4 military among active - duty troops surged to a record 349 last year			1
the number , an increase of 48 suicides compared to 2011 , represents a record high since the military began tracking suicides in 2001			1
the number also exceeds the 295 americans who died in @entity7 last year			1
the @entity70 , by far the largest of the military services , had the highest number of suicides among active - duty troops last year at 182 , but the @entity92 , whose suicide numbers had declined for two years , had the largest percentage increase — a 50 percent jump to 48			1
the @entity92 ' worst year was 2009 's 52 suicides			1
each year the @entity10 performs an in - depth study of the circumstances of each suicide			2
the most recent year for which that analysis is available is 2011 , and among the findings was that those who took their own lives tended to be white men under the age of 25 , in the junior enlisted ranks , with less than a college education			2
the analysis of 2011 's 301 military suicides also found that the suicide rate for divorced service members was 55 percent higher than for those who were married			1
it determined that 60 percent of military suicides were committed with the use of firearms — and in most cases the guns were personal weapons , not military - issued			2
that study also found that most service members who attempted suicide — about 65 percent — had a known history of behavior problems , whereas 45 percent of those who actually completed the act and killed themselves had such a history			0
one such case was @entity70 spc. @entity270 , 29 , who killed himself last august at an off - post residence he shared with another member of the @entity273 at @entity29 , @entity30 , according to his sister , @entity274			2
' he was practically begging for help and nothing was done , ' she said in an interview			0
she said he had been diagnosed with an ' adjustment disorder ' — a problem of coping with the uncertainties of returning home after three deployments in war zones			0
she believes the @entity70 failed her brother by not doing more to ensure that he received the help he needed before he became suicidal			0
' it 's the responsibility of the military to help these men and women , ' she said			0
' they sent them over there ( to war ) ; they should be helping them when they come back			0
