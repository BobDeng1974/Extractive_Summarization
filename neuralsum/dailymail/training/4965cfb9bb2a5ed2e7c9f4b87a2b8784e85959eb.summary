the mother - of - one from @entity20 , @entity21 , is now demanding a formal apology from @entity9 , now part of @entity24 , after she was sent the poorly - worded text which read : ' you are so pathetic you ca n't pay your bill and you blame it other people			1

' the text i received was awful			0
i was out for lunch with my mother when my phone buzzed with a text from @entity9			2
' when i read it , i was in shock			0
i could not believe someone would send me an abusive text like that , especially when they are meant to be there to help			0
' it was borderline bullying and it is disgusting			0
' ms @entity2 and mr @entity17 , 24 , have a joint account with @entity9 , which is in her name , and they pay for their mobile phone bill by direct debit each month			1
however , in april the pair received an unexpectedly high bill for £ 110			1
mr @entity17 called @entity24 customer services and was told there had been a problem with the direct debit in march , resulting in the payment not being made and so it had been rolled over into april			1
' they told us we had missed a month , even though we have a direct debit , but we received a really high bill in april , which was a shock , ' he said			1
the car salesman added : ' we did not understand how the bill had shot up without them telling us , so we rang @entity9			2
' we were told @entity2 should have rung up and paid the bill over the phone			2
but as we had the direct debit we assumed it would have been paid			2
' ms @entity2 said : ' because of the high bill , we have had to forfeit other things and it has really messed up our finances			1
' and then for someone to send me a text with abuse afterwards is just out of order			0
' after the couple had queried the bill , ms @entity2 received an automated text asking for rating on customer service			1
shock : the mother - of - one from @entity20 , @entity21 , is now demanding a formal apology from @entity9 , now part of @entity24 , after she received this poorly - worded text ' we were so unimpressed that we responded with " one out of 10 " to every question , ' said mr @entity17			1
the following day @entity2 received the abusive text			1
' we just could n't believe it			0
it was a despicable thing to send to @entity2 and it really upset her , ' mr @entity17 said			2
' i called up @entity9 straight away and the employee apologised on behalf of the colleague who had sent the text and i was told it would be dealt with			2
' mr @entity17 said he has been chasing @entity9 every week for an apology , but according to the couple they are yet to hear from the company			2
' it has been weeks now and i 've heard nothing , ' said ms @entity2 , who works for supermarket chain @entity101			1
' no - one should receive a text like that , let alone from a big professional company			0
it is just not good enough			0
' the couple , who are parents to a 21 - month - old son , @entity109 , say they are appalled with @entity9			0
' i feel like this has not been taken seriously at all			0
it is disgusting that they have n't bothered to ring @entity2 to apologise , ' mr @entity17 said			1
' even just a supervisor or manager calling to let me know that they have acknowledged the matter and are taking it seriously would be enough at this point			0
' he added : ' our contract does n't finish until september so basically we 're drawn in until then			0
' i do n't want to carry on giving them our business after all of this			0
i think they need to do more to apologise as it was serious bullying behavior			0
