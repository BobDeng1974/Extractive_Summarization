by @entity0 if you 've been know to let fly with the odd expletive in the presence of your newborn , it might be time to stop			0
scientists have discovered that not only do babies pick up language from their parents , they can understand three times as many words as they can say			1
what 's more , infants have incredible mnemonic powers which means they can parrot a stray swear word back to you weeks after you let it slip			2
clever : @entity19 and @entity20 ( pictured with their mother ) had learned sign language by the age of six months the incredible findings will be unveiled on @entity27 documentary , @entity26 , which also features twins @entity19 and @entity20 , two , from @entity29 in @entity30 , who learned to communicate far earlier than their peers			1
because both of their parents are profoundly deaf , the pair were exposed to sign language from birth - and began signing their desires to their parents from the age of six months			1
' it 's interesting because at the beginning when we were at home , it would be just the four of us and we would be signing all the time , ' reveals their proud father , @entity45			0
' when they were very young , it felt at times as if you were speaking to a brick wall - you did n't get any response - and then a few months later , they would tap me and start recalling what i had told them a few weeks or months before			2
' while @entity19 and @entity20 were able to build upon their parents use of sign language , babies born to average parents are equally good at remembering words - even if it does take them longer to vocalise it			1
proof : the pair appear to bear out scientists ' findings by learning to communicate before they could talk evolved : babies are naturally afraid of plants but learn the correct response to animals from their parents clever : most babies learn to talk by watching their parents ' mouths and copying the motion ' i found it amazing how they were able to recall that information , ' adds mr @entity20			1
' once they had mastered sign language , they could re-tell that story to me very clearly			1
' interestingly , the twins ' ability to communicate in sign language has had no impact on their ability to pick up spoken words			1
' they have started going to nursery and are hearing sound and spoken language a lot more so now they use spoken and sign language at the same time , ' says their mother , @entity95			2
' if they hear someone speaking , they respond using their spoken language , ' adds mr @entity20			2
' if they see someone signing , they will respond in sign so they 're using a mixture of both			0
' as the documentary reveals , @entity19 and @entity20 's incredible communication skills are n't unique , with all babies born with the ability to recognise the 150 different sounds that make up every language in the world			1
but speaking is n't the only surprising skill common to the majority of babies			0
most babies loathe plants , a quirk that scientists say evolved to protect them from poisonous and thorny fauna			0
equally interesting is the reason for babies ' seemingly magical ability to drop off to sleep during car journeys			0
according to scientists , this goes back to hearing their mother 's heart beat while in the womb which they can hear so loudly , its decibel equivalent is the sound of a car engine			0
the muffled sounds of the engine and the gentle rocking motion of driving mimics life inside the womb , helping them to drift off to sleep - one tip that exhausted new mothers might want to remember			0
the @entity26 , tonight at 9pm on @entity148			0
