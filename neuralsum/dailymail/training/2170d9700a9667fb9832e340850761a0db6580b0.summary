@entity0 has been charged with using insulting language by the @entity2 over his foul - mouthed row with a @entity5 fan			1
the @entity5 manager was filmed appearing to tell an abusive supporter to ‘ f * * * off and die ’ after being called an ‘ utter t * * * ’ near the end of @entity5 ’s defeat by @entity12 at the @entity13 on december 2			1
@entity0 has until 6pm on tuesday to respond but has so far been unrepentant			1
he said last week : ‘ i ’m more than happy to stand up for myself in that situation			2
if people were offended then that is regrettable but there is no need to apologise to somebody of that ilk			2
’ @entity5 boss @entity0 has been charged by the @entity2 after an incident with a @entity23 supporter @entity0 ( centre ) will have to await the @entity2 's submission before finding out if he faces a misconduct charge @entity0 stands on the touchline during the defeat by @entity12 before launching his tirade @entity5 manager @entity0 appeared to tell the supporter to ' f * * * off and die ' during the match the @entity2 statement read : ‘ it is alleged that during the fixture mr @entity0 used abusive and / or insulting words towards a spectator			1
’ if @entity0 accepts the charge or is found guilty , he faces a fine and touchline ban — although he already elects to sit in the stands during matches			1
his expletive - fuelled exchange came when he travelled to the dugout for the closing stages			2
@entity0 made the decision to move to the stands after serving a one - match touchline ban for clashing with officials after a game in august 2013			1
@entity49 was given a three - match stadium ban last march — but that was for the much more serious offence of headbutting @entity53			0
in april 2011 , @entity54 was suspended for two games for swearing into a television camera , while @entity57 was handed a one - match ban in december that year for making an obscene gesture to @entity61 fans			0
an @entity62 will decide any potential sanction if the charge is proven			0
yesterday , before the @entity2 made their announcement , @entity0 was tight - lipped			1
‘ i have said as much as i want to say on that subject , regardless of what happens here on in i wo n’t be saying much more , ’ he said			0
‘ my focus is totally on this next game and we welcome the champions			0
’ the @entity5 boss continues his tirade against the supporter from the touchline @entity0 ’s preparations for the visit of @entity79 were dealt a huge blow after @entity81 suffered a broken metatarsal during training yesterday morning			1
the @entity85 goalkeeper will undergo an operation today and has been ruled out for at least a month — but @entity0 admitted that diagnosis was optimistic and it ‘ could be longer ’ depending on the surgeon ’s findings			2
‘ there was no contact			0
normally what happens with those injuries is a stress situation , foot to the floor , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ clearly the lad ’s distressed about it — he will be a big miss for us but what you have to do is deal with it			0
’ @entity104 will step up for the @entity5 game — having kept a clean sheet at @entity107 in september — but @entity0 admitted he was likely to dip into the transfer market			1
‘ i would have thought so , ’ he said			0
‘ if he ’s going to be four to six weeks at the earliest then i ’ll be considering options certainly			0
’ @entity112 under 21 goalkeeper @entity111 , back at @entity107 following an emergency loan spell at @entity114 , and @entity115 , third choice at @entity117 , would both be available .			0

@entity2 asked @entity0 for his thoughts on his row with a fan
the @entity5 boss got into the argument during the defeat by @entity12
asking for his *observations* is a routine move by the @entity2
the @entity23 boss has *n't* apologised to the fan and said he wants to move on
