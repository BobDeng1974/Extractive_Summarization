the strain was etched on @entity2 ’s face yesterday just hours after video footage of her new husband cosying up to a pretty fan emerged			1
the images , from @entity8 cameras at a rowdy @entity10 bar where @entity12 rugby players partied on sunday , clearly show captain @entity13 kissing the blonde and leaving with her			1
it was claimed yesterday that the girl is a friend of the couple who attended their wedding			1
despite desperate attempts by the @entity12 camp to play down the players ’ wild night out , the leaked recording instantly became a worldwide internet sensation			1
@entity26 faces : @entity2 looks pained , pictured at the @entity27 at @entity28 in @entity29 , @entity30			1
later , however , her mood did brighten and she managed a smile although his behaviour was initially dismissed as just ‘ boisterous horseplay ’ , @entity13 , 32 , can be seen hugging and groping the woman as they knock back shots of cheap vodka at the altitude bar in @entity41			2
it had also initially been suggested that the pair did not leave the bar together , but the newly released video also puts paid to that			2
@entity13 can plainly be seen taking the female partygoer by the hand and pulling her across the dancefloor towards the exit			2
from that point , the colour footage changes to black and white film from different cctv cameras positioned around the bar ’s entrance			2
as they stand by the doors , the pair openly cuddle before the woman pulls @entity13 towards her chest and kisses his shaven head			2
scroll down to view video headlock : the mystery blonde pulls @entity13 's shaven head towards her bosom at the altitude club in @entity10 where some @entity12 team - mates relaxed cuddle : @entity13 is seen on @entity8 putting his arm round the girl at the nightclub in @entity10 hugger : @entity76 captain @entity13 closes in on the mystery blonde as he heads towards the exit outside on the street she appears to make several half - hearted attempts to return inside to her friends , but the player puts her in an affectionate headlock to prevent her from doing so and pulls her towards him			1
the pair then walk off out of shot , entwined in each other ’s arms			2
miss @entity2 , 30 , continued to decline to comment about the scandal yesterday but friends insisted that the incident had ‘ been blown out of all proportion ’			1
one source close to the @entity95 ’s granddaughter , who has been married for just six weeks , claimed the woman was ‘ a friend ’ of the couple and had even been a guest at their wedding in july			2
‘ she is a friend of both @entity13 and @entity2 and has known @entity13 since university days , ’ they said			1
touching : @entity13 gets up front and personal with the buxom blonde at the bar face to face : another girl and @entity13 have an intimate chat at the bar where later he was seen cuddling her blonde friend flirting : @entity13 and the girl at the bar where the @entity12 captain and team - mates had gone to relax after they beat @entity115 in their first @entity76 match ‘ she is an @entity117 girl living in @entity118 who was at their wedding			1
@entity2 is very relaxed about all this and the whole thing has been blown out of all proportion			1
’ it is understood that miss @entity2 has spoken to her husband about the incident and still plans to join him in @entity10 , where @entity12 are competing in the @entity76 , later this month			1
another source , who claimed to have spoken to @entity2 personally , claimed she had dismissed the entire furore as ‘ irrelevant ’			1
‘ she has no problem whatsoever with anything @entity13 has done , ’ they maintained			2
but as she competed at the @entity132 at @entity28 near @entity29 , @entity30 , miss @entity2 , a world champion three - day eventer who has hopes of representing her country in the @entity138 next year , appeared under stress			1
scrum : @entity141 and @entity12 rugby captain @entity13 grabs @entity142 and @entity143 as they party at the altitude bar in @entity10 's south island pint - sized : @entity12 's @entity143 looks like he needs a hand as he parties with two dwarfs despite an almost flawless dressage routine on her horse , @entity153 , and a small smile to the crowd following her eight - minute routine , as she was driven away from the course on the back of an electric golf buggy she pulled down her hat and covered her face with her hand			1
newlyweds : @entity13 and @entity2 have only been married for 48 days , but he has been criticised for his ' behaviour ' at a nightclub @entity13 , who captained the team in their unconvincing win over @entity115 last saturday but is being rested this weekend , was among a group of more than half a dozen internationals that ended up in the grimy @entity171 bar following a night of heavy drinking			1
they included fullback @entity174 , whose girlfriend , @entity175 , a singer with girlband @entity176 , yesterday announced she was pregnant			2
the group appeared to make the most of the nightspot ’s £ 2 a shot vodka promotion and posed for photographs with girl fans as well as several dwarfs who had been hired to ‘ entertain ’ the drinkers as part of a ‘ @entity188 ’ by running the length of the bar with a bungee rope attached to them			2
at an @entity12 press conference yesterday , manager @entity193 continued to defend his players , @entity13 in particular			1
he said their antics were simply a case of the team ‘ letting off steam ’ the day after their first match , explaining : ‘ [ the ] players said , “ we ’re going to go out for a beer on sunday night ” and i said , “ great idea ”			2
you ’ve got to relieve the pressure valve , let off steam , at the right time			0
in the pressure of a @entity76 you ’ve got to find those opportunities			0
i had no problem with them doing that			0
’ asked whether he felt betrayed by their antics , he added : ‘ no , i do n’t			0
we knew the players were going to go out and have a few beers			0
people can report it how they want to report it			0
the guys are fully aware of their responsibilities			0
no one likes to be on the front page of papers but we know where the world is at the moment			0
‘ i ’ve got a choice to lock them away and keep them out of the public in all forms or we get on and try to enjoy this tournament and be successful			0
i ’d rather do that			0
‘ i ’ve had my arms around 50 women in @entity41 aged from seven months to 77			0
everyone wants to get a piece of you and get their photograph taken with @entity246 either lock ourselves away and do n’t talk to anyone or we try to enjoy the experience at the right time , in the right place and in the right way			0

it ’s up to @entity13 what he wants to do away from training and playing			0
i ’m sure , @entity13 being @entity13 , he ’ll want to get on with the rugby as quickly as possible			0
’ partying hard : @entity13 was still wearing his morning suit the afternoon after his wedding to @entity2 in july @entity13 ’s team - mate @entity143 , who was present in the bar , also defended their behaviour but admitted they needed to be ‘ more careful ’ in the future			1
‘ we had a night out and a day off			0
it does everyone a favour			0
it gives us all a laugh , makes everyone relaxed , ’ he said			0
‘ there ’s not much in it			0
it ’s just lads having a night out ... we genuinely do n’t see anything in it			0
we just ended up in that bar – not specifically for the dwarf - racing			0
‘ if you have a picture with fans and they happen to be girls you can make anything you want with it			0
’ the players ’ antics were captured on @entity8 , footage of which was broadcast over the internet yesterday by a bouncer at the club named @entity313 , who claimed he was releasing it due to his disgust at @entity13 ’s behaviour			1
although he subsequently withdrew it after pressure from friends , he claimed in an internet video that he was n’t ‘ making a cent ’ out of the film , adding : ‘ i ’m a man who feels very sorry for what @entity13 has done to the @entity325			0
‘ the way he behaved is not the way decent people , particularly when you have been married for only a few weeks , behave			0
' mr @entity13 , your behaviour was that of someone unbecoming , especially to someone such as the @entity95 or @entity2			1
’ the bar ’s manager , @entity334 , said @entity313 ’s contract has been withdrawn for releasing @entity8 footage without permission and the incident has been reported to police			1
trouble ahead : @entity13 knows he is in for a rough time from his new wife in the next few weeks , but they are both avid party - goers who have never had drink far from their side cheers ! @entity2 swigs from a beer bottle following a horse trial in @entity348 in 2008			1
@entity13 has previously boasted about his wife 's capacity for alcohol in interviews			2
