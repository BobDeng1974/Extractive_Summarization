@entity1 president @entity0 has backed a ' free and open @entity2 ' and called for tough rules to protect against putting online services that do n't pay extra fees into a ' slow lane			1
' @entity0 endorsed an effort to reclassify the internet as a public utility to give regulators more authority to enforce ' net neutrality , ' which bars @entity13 from opening up ' fast lanes ' for services that pay fees for better access			1
in a statement , @entity0 said he wants the independent @entity18 to ' implement the strongest possible rules to protect net neutrality			1
' @entity0 's comment comes amid heated debate among online industry sectors as the @entity18 seeks to draft new rules to replace those struck down this year by a @entity1 appeals court , which said the agency lacked authority to regulate internet service firms as it does telephone carriers			1
'' net neutrality ' has been built into the fabric of the internet since its creation -- but it is also a principle that we can not take for granted , ' @entity0 said in a statement			1
' we can not allow internet service providers to restrict the best access or to pick winners and losers in the online marketplace for services and ideas			0
' @entity0 said that while the @entity18 is an independent agency , he wants the regulatory body to maintain key principles of net neutrality			1
he said the rules should ensure ' no block ' of any legal content , to ensure that an internet firm does not block one service such as @entity56 to promote a rival one			2
another key principle endorsed by @entity0 would prohibit ' paid prioritization ' that would allow one service to get into a faster lane by paying extra			2
' no service should be stuck in a ' slow lane ' because it does not pay a fee , ' @entity0 said			2
' that kind of gatekeeping would undermine the level playing field essential to the @entity2 's growth			2
under the plans for priority usage , @entity56 and other video providers would pay extra to use fast lanes to get the maximum amount of bandwith to its customers , and maintain and improve streaming quality and reliability			2
this is being heavily criticised by net neutrality campaigners			1
at the heart of net neutrality is an open internet in which all data being sent from websites to customers is treated the same , regardless of size or destination			1
all this traffic is given the same priority along the same lanes and no site is given preferential treatment			0
although it seems like a fair model , in which sites that use the most bandwith pay the most money , campaigners claim it will drastically impact on industry competition			0
for example , @entity56 has the money to pay for better service , using the fast lanes , while smaller companies do n't			0
this means smaller companies may have the same range of content , but because they ca n't stream at the same quality , they are effectively priced out of the market			0
to address these claims , the new rules include a ' competition test '			2
isps would need to decide if a website meets the critieria to be given priority access and that this bar must be set high enough to protect competition			0
' so , as i have before , i am asking for an explicit ban on paid prioritization and any other restriction that has a similar effect			0
' @entity0 said he wants the rules to bar any ' throttling ' or slowing of content at the discretion of the service provider			1
he also said he wants the same rules to apply to mobile broadband , which was not covered in the earlier regulations			0
to accomplish this , @entity0 said the rules should reclassify consumer broadband service as a public utility -- a move that has been fiercely opposed by the companies that would be affected			1
@entity0 's statement places him squarely in the camp of many consumer activists and online services and against industry sectors involved in @entity2 delivery			1
the @entity18 is redrafting its rules after the court decision struck down its regulations in a case brought by @entity1 broadband giant @entity148			0
@entity148 and its allies have argued that the @entity18 lacks authority to interfere with their business , and that @entity153 never decided these companies were regulated utilities or ' common carriers			0
' telecom firms reacted angrily to the move			1
@entity159 , who heads the @entity160 , said the reclassification ' would set the industry back decades , and threaten the private sector investment that is critically needed to ensure that the network can meet surging demand			0
' in a @entity169 column sunday , @entity167 chief @entity166 said this kind of regulation is ' a rusty sledgehammer that has been sitting in the garage for 20 years			0
' @entity174 at the @entity175 said @entity0 's proposal would be ' a shift that will redefine the @entity2 , insert the government deeply into its management and invite other countries to do the same			1
' @entity1 president @entity0 speaks during a press conference on november 5 , 2014 in @entity182 , dc. he said the new rules should ensure ' no block ' of any legal content , to ensure that an internet firm does not block one service such as @entity56 to promote a rival one			2
however , many in the industry backed the president			0
the @entity192 , a lobbying group that represents web companies such as @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 and @entity56 , said : ' @entity192 applauds president @entity0 's proposal for the adoption of meaningful net neutrality rules that apply to both mobile and fixed broadband			1
' as we have previously said , the @entity18 must adopt strong , legally sustainable rules that prevent paid prioritization and protect an open internet for users			2
' @entity208 , chief executive of @entity209 , an online marketplace that focuses on handmade and vintage items , said : ' i 'm thrilled to see president @entity0 stand with @entity209 and our sellers in calling for strong net neutrality rules under @entity217 ' the president has proved that he truly is a champion of the @entity2			1
i urge ( @entity18 ) chairman @entity219 to follow suit			0
' @entity18 chairman @entity219 welcomed @entity0 's statement but offered no timetable for the new rules			1
' like the president , i believe that the @entity2 must remain an open platform for free expression , innovation , and economic growth			0
we both oppose @entity2 fast lanes , ' @entity219 said in a statement			0
but he noted that reclassification poses ' substantive legal questions , ' and that the agency needs time ' to ensure that whatever approach is taken , it can withstand any legal challenges it may face			0
