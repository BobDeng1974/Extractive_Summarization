somewhere , @entity0 will be watching this @entity2 final			1
he is officially the best player on the planet this year but if his great rival writes his name all over the game ’s greatest showpiece on sunday night , who will ever remember that ? the @entity11 winner went home a fortnight ago			1
@entity0 was not able to carry a dreadful @entity13 through the group stages on his own			1
who knows if he will ever be back			0
@entity16 , though , has been more successful with his own personal crusade here in @entity19			1
this is not a great @entity22 team - far from it - but @entity16 has hauled them to @entity24 , where they will face a @entity26 side who have been at their ruthless best in punishing opponents ’ mistakes in this tournament			1
@entity26 are favourites to triumph , but do n’t write off @entity16 seizing the opportunity to claim the final as his own			1
at times he has found his best and consistent form elusive but his strength of will is equal perhaps to anyone who has ever played this game and , when it has mattered , he has dug as deep as he can go to find the contributions required			0
@entity16 has scored four goals in the tournament			1
his last - minute winner against @entity71 in @entity22 ’s second game is one of the standout moments of this @entity2			1
equally important , though , was the run and pass that allowed @entity77 to score against @entity78 in a last - 16 game that the @entity80 easily could have lost			0
this is what the really great players do			0
according to his own father , @entity16 has been feeling tired as the tournament has progressed			1
certainly his influence against @entity88 in the semi-final was relatively muted and it is worth remembering that @entity92 ’s season in @entity93 continued competitively until the very last weekend			2
quadruple : @entity16 has scored four goals for @entity22 at this @entity2 but all were during the group stages deadly duo : @entity16 and @entity99 ( right ) have inspired @entity22 to the @entity2 final 5 - @entity16 has scored five goals at the @entity2 , but he has never scored in the knockout stages ‘ i spoke with him and he said he felt like his legs weighed 100 kgs , ’ said @entity103 to a @entity105 newspaper			1
@entity108 argues that @entity16 has not been at his best over the last month			2
he is not alone in that view			0
@entity16 , though , is the type of footballer who does n’t have to trample all over a football game in order to definitively influence it			2
to return to the @entity0 theme , the @entity117 forward plays like it is an affront for anybody else on either team to actually have the ball			2
this is not @entity16 ’s way			2
the @entity22 @entity125 will drift in and out of games , choosing his moments to contribute			2
against @entity130 in the quarter - final , for example , he was quiet for long periods but the pass he slid through a needle ’s eye to release @entity77 in the first half astonished those who were there to witness it			0
certainly , he will present @entity26 with a unique threat at the @entity140 tomorrow			1
many are waiting to see if the 27 - year - old can personalise a @entity2 final as @entity144 did when @entity22 beat @entity26 3 - 2 in 1986			1
@entity144 did n’t score that day in @entity145 but , undoubtedly , it was his tournament			2
little magician : @entity144 single - handedly led @entity22 to the @entity2 in 1986 and to the final in 1990 star : @entity88 's @entity152 ( right ) has arguably been the @entity2 's best player the 2014 version has not belonged solely to @entity16			1
it has been a better tournament than that , more varied			0
@entity152 has arguably been its star individual but he is destined for a third - place contest against @entity19 tonight after @entity88 fell to @entity22 on wednesday			1
@entity26 will certainly present a more consistent and varied threat than @entity88			2
they have also had a considerably more comfortable build - up to the final			0
@entity22 and @entity16 played 120 minutes against @entity88			1
a day earlier , @entity26 were able to release their foot from the gas after those remarkable opening 45 minutes against @entity19			2
it is unlikely that @entity26 will worry about @entity16 as others have			1
coach @entity167 may consider moving his most reliable player @entity168 back into midfield from full back in order to ‘ look after ’ the @entity22 captain but , equally , he may feel the tactical intelligence , concentration and physicality of @entity175 will be enough			1
the danger of obsessing about @entity16 is clear			2
@entity88 did it to a degree on wednesday which almost inevitably led to right - sided forward @entity179 having one of his best games of the @entity2			0
adored : @entity16 can be heralded alongside @entity144 if he inspires @entity22 to their third @entity2 race against time : @entity77 is struggling to be fit for @entity22 's final with @entity26 on sunday if the expressive and direct @entity77 regains fitness in time for sunday , @entity26 ’s rather modest full backs will have something else to do worry about , too			1
@entity77 is unlikely to make it while it will be interesting to see if @entity190 is fit enough to start			0
the @entity192 player has not made an impact here yet			0
he is another player , though , who has an immaculate sense of timing			0
@entity26 , perhaps , do not have such striking individuals			0
it is tempting to label this final as one man against a machine			0
that would patronise @entity167 ’s team , though			0
they have scored 17 goals in this @entity2 and have spread those across eight different players			0
@entity22 , meanwhile , boast only four goalscorers			0
@entity16 has brought his nation to this final admirably			0
those from his country who have poured across the border to sleep in cars and on the beach in the @entity24 rain in recent days have come to see him crowned on the most fitting stage of all			0
@entity26 are the team in form , though , and i expect them to win this final			0
time to shine ? @entity190 has been poor for @entity22 so far but could light up the final machine : @entity26 have scored 17 goals so far at this @entity2 and should be favourites for the final position : @entity26 's decision to shift @entity168 back to full - back has benefited the side			1

@entity0 is officially the best player on the planet in 2014 but is back home
@entity16 has helped take @entity22 one step away from their third @entity2
the @entity92 star is jaded and he needs to give one last big effort
@entity16 must inspire @entity22 to the trophy like @entity144 did in 1986
it will be @entity16 vs the ' machine ' of @entity26 at the @entity140 on sunday
