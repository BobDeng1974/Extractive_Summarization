by @entity0 published : 06:58 est , 15 october 2012 updated : 08:43 est , 15 october 2012 a three - year - old boy who suffered a massive stroke in the womb has stunned doctors by learning to walk , talk and see in time for his first day at nursery			1
@entity7 was delivered six weeks early in august 2009 after midwives could not find his @entity10 twin sister @entity9 was born healthy , @entity6 had experienced massive bleeding in the left side of his brain and was severely brain damaged			1
the stroke could have killed an adult and mother @entity15 , 34 , and father @entity18 , 37 , from @entity19 , were warned he would not develop normally			2
@entity6 , now aged 3 ( left ) , suffered a brain bleed while still in the womb			1
he has surprised doctors with his progress and can now walk and talk			1
pictured , right , aged one , wearing electrodes during a brain scan but now @entity6 has joined his sister at preschool , where he is walking , talking , and can see to a distance of six metres			1
@entity15 , from @entity19 , said : ' as far as i knew , i had been carrying healthy twins , until i had a routine checkup when they could n’t find his heartbeat			0
' i knew my children had to be delivered as quickly as possible			2
i was rushed for an emergency c - section			0
' @entity9 came out first , crying at the top of her lungs			0
@entity6 came out two minutes later , but he was n’t crying			1
the quiet made me panic			0
' i was able to hold @entity6 for a few minutes and i noticed his thumbs were sticking into his hands			1
i thought it was just a result of how he had been positioned in the womb			0
' but two days later , a @entity43 scan revealed that @entity6 had suffered bleeding in his brain while he was still in the womb , five days before he was delivered			1
doctors battled to stabilise @entity6 by attaching him to a drip and boosting his immune system , but there was little they could do other than wait to see what happened			1
@entity15 , who split with @entity6 ’s father before the birth , was told her son was still bleeding and she should prepare for the worst			1
she said : ' tears were streaming down my face			0
i could n’t believe what was happening			0
' i was told to consider @entity6 ’s quality of life			1
if the bleeding did n’t stop and the brain damage got worse , i would have to prepare to let @entity6 go			1
' i told the doctor i did n’t want to have to make that choice			2
i could n’t face turning off a life - support machine			0
' @entity6 ( right ) pictured with his twin sister @entity9 who was unaffected in the womb			1
their mother said it was difficult seeing their different rates of progress @entity6 learnt to walk with the help of a walker aged two even if @entity6 survived , he would be left with 14 serious health conditions , including cerebral palsy , microcephaly disorder , epilepsy , swelling on the brain , and respiratory problems			1
@entity15 said : ' the news was like a slap in the face			0
doctors told me it was unlikely that @entity6 would ever walk or see			1
' the part of his brain which affects his speech was also heavily damaged , so talking was another milestone he would find difficult to reach			2
' incredibly , @entity6 survived and left hospital three months later to join @entity9 , brother @entity90 , 13 , and sisters @entity92 , seven , and @entity93 , 15 , at home			1
by the end of the year , doctors were amazed at his progress			2
@entity15 said : ' he first started seeing shadows at nine months old			0
shortly after his first birthday he reached out for a teddy bear			0
' i got the video camera out and videoed him doing it again			0
i could n’t believe he could recognise it			0
' his first words were ‘ dada ’ and ‘ dandan ’ - his godfather @entity107			0
he can now say ‘ @entity107 ’ as well , and uses that for ‘ serious conversation ’ like asking him if he can use his @entity109			0
' when he took his first steps in june this year i thought it was a miracle			0
' my biggest fear was that he would n’t be able to walk			2
a defining moment was at his godfather ’s wedding in july 2011 , when he walked down the aisle			0
' we were so proud of him making his own way down with his zimmer frame covered in ribbons and bows			0
' when @entity6 walked into the consultant ’s room for his most recent cat scan in march , our doctor could n’t quite believe it			1
' looking at the scan of his brain he turned to me and said ‘ @entity15 , he should n’t be doing any of this			2
walking , talking - it ’s incredible ’			0
' liam with his proud mother @entity15 , from @entity19			0
sadly @entity6 is not expected to survive beyond the age of 30 last month @entity15 proudly dropped @entity6 and @entity9 off at the @entity134 in @entity19 , where his progress has continued			1
preschool keyworker @entity136 said : ' i first met @entity6 in january and it ’s amazing how much he ’s improved since then			1
' he ’s settled in extremely well			0
he loves playing with the other children and he ’s very popular ' he has developed beyond what anyone expected , both physically and in his level understanding			2
' although strokes are usually associated with adults , around 400 infants and children are affected by the condition each year			2
consultant pediatric neurosurgeon at @entity148 in @entity149 , dr @entity150 , said @entity6 ’s continual improvement can be partially attributed to the fitting of a tube which drains excess fluid from @entity6 ’s brain to his stomach , where it can be absorbed			1
@entity6 ’s young brain has been better able to adapt to the trauma caused by the stroke			1
dr @entity150 said : ' children up to seven years old have increased plasticity , allowing functions within the brain to swap from one side to the other			1
' the stroke @entity6 suffered is often fatal in adults			1
children have a great capacity for recovery			2
' in @entity6 ’s case , functions of the brain on the left side , which had been damaged , have been taken over by the right side			1
' @entity15 believes @entity6 has also responded well to her use of music , light and sound therapy in his daily routine			1
she said : ' music therapy is his favourite			0
he loves @entity184 , as he knows that means nap time			0
before @entity6 arrived , i took developmental milestones for granted			1
' i ’ve always taken photos when my children get their first pair of shoes			2
unfortunately , when i took @entity9 to get her first pair , @entity6 was n’t walking and had some problems with his feet			1
' watching @entity9 pose for photos , it saddened me that her brother could n’t be there too			0
' @entity200 are meant to do everything together , but she walked before him , talked before him - she did everything before him			0
@entity6 ( left ) pictured with sister @entity9 aged one month old @entity6 in an incubator two days after he was born			1
he needs constant care and medication ' i was n’t giving up though - i wanted that photo			0
i got it , a year later , when @entity6 was ready for his first pair of shoes			2
it was an emotional day , but everything is more emotional with @entity6			2
' it seems unfair that , of the two twins , @entity6 had to draw the short straw			2
i have no idea why it happened to him and not @entity9 , apart from that she was always the more dominant one in the womb			0
scans showed her to be heavier and taking up more room			0
' it is a struggle to watch them grow up side by side , knowing that their lives will be so different			2
' @entity15 has been advised that @entity6 , who needs constant care and medication to control his various health conditions , is unlikely to live beyond 30 years old			1
despite the heartache and challenges , @entity15 says she draws strength from @entity6 every day			2
she has started a @entity230 group , called @entity231 , to give hope families in similar circumstances			0
she said : ' i ’m so proud of everything that @entity6 has achieved			1
' i want to raise awareness , not just of the fact that babies and children can suffer from strokes , but also of ways that parents can encourage progress			0
' i started the ‘ @entity231 ’ campaign to share my experiences with other mums in my position and let them know there is hope for the future			0

@entity253 told she had to prepare to let her son go , after he suffered a brain bleed five days before he was born
doctors said he was unlikely to ever walk or see , but @entity6 achieved both milestones by the age of three
children up to seven years old have greater brain plasticity so can swap brain functions from one side to the other following a stroke
