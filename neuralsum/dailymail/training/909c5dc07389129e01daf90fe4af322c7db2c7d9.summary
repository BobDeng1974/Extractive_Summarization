it may just sound like baby talk , but mothers who hold a ‘ conversation ’ with their infants are actually teaching them to speak more quickly			2
researchers found new mothers who respond enthusiastically to their baby ’s babbling are helping to speed up the child ’s language development they say parental feedback is a vital process that enables mothers and babies to become mutually engaged in ‘ talking ’			1
mothers who communicate with their babies help speed up their speech and language development , file photo it enhances the ability of children to communicate – unlike cases where mums did not respond attentively			1
a new study , by @entity28 academics at the @entity29 ( @entity29 ) and @entity30 , serves as evidence that speaking to infants at a very early age is vital for their development			1
the authors say parents who babble back at their newborns – even if they do n’t understand what they ’re trying to say – are a key part of the process			2
the findings challenge the belief that human communication is innate and can not be influenced by parental feedback			0
instead , the researchers argue that parents who consciously engage with their babbling infants can accelerate their children ’s vocalising and language learning			1
senior study author @entity52 , assistant professor of psychology at the @entity29 , said ‘ it ’s not that we found responsiveness matters			0
‘ it ’s how a mother responds that matter			0
’ @entity60 observed the interactions between 12 mothers and their eight - month - old infants during free play twice a month for 30 minutes over a six - month period			1
they noted how the mothers responded to their child ’s positive vocalisations , such as babbling and cooing , especially when it was directed toward the mother			2
current research in dr @entity74 ’s lab has found similar levels of responsiveness of mothers and fathers to infants ’ babbling			0
researchers discovered that infants whose mothers responded to what they thought their babies were saying showed an increase in more complex sounds , with consonant - vowel vocalisations			1
they say the babbling has become sophisticated enough to sound more like words to the mother			0
researchers found that mothers who ignored their infants impeded their development , photo posed by models the babies also began directing more of their babbling over time toward their mothers			1
however , infants whose mothers did not try as much to understand them and instead directed their infants ’ attention at times to something else did not show the same rate of growth in their language and communication skills			1
the findings are published in the latest edition of the journal @entity111			0
dr @entity74 says the difference was mothers who engaged with their infants when they babbled let their children know they could communicate			0
consequently , those babies turned more often to their mothers and babbled			2
she said ‘ the infants were using vocalisations in a communicative way , in a sense , because they learned they are communicative			0
’ in a survey a month after the study ended , mothers who were most attentive to their infants ’ babbling reported their children produced more words and gestures at the age of 15 months			2
last month a study from @entity28 researchers showed that exposing infants to clear vocal sounds from birth helps them distinguish language from other noises			1
they found that babies aged seven months can differentiate voices from other sounds - even when they can not see the person speaking			0
by the age of 11 months , before they can speak themselves , the children have already learned to differentiate their mother tongue from other languages , the scientists discovered .			0

mothers who interact with their babies speed up their language skills
parents who do not respond to their child *'s* gurgling *inhibit* development
@entity28 researchers studied 12 mothers and their babies over a six month period
