in the hometown of @entity2 , it seemed only appropriate to talk about 12 rounds			2
twelve rounds of golf that have changed the sport ’s landscape entirely and will go down in the annals as creating a new standard for the @entity11 game			1
spread over three tournaments , what began in bright sunlight on the ancient links at @entity16 at @entity17 in july ended on sunday in darkness on the modern stadium course at @entity20 in @entity21			2
@entity22 went into those trio of events with doubts about his ability to play the most venerable form of the game ; with freaky fridays swirling his conscience			1
the only players he will ever be compared to again are @entity47 and @entity48			1
while he will surely never reach the majors total of the former , or assume quite the level of dominance of the latter , he might actually have more strings to his bow than either			2
for even the two guardians of the record books had weaknesses			2
@entity47 was never a great chipper or bunker player while @entity48 never won a major coming from behind on the final day			1
but where is @entity22 ’s weakness , after these 12 rounds ? at @entity16 he showed his ability to learn an alien form , for links play was never his forte ; at the @entity67 , a prowess to dominate an event from start to finish			1
and then at @entity20 came the gossamer touch and all the guts and heart a golfer can display			2
pure theatre : the @entity33 ended in virtual darkness following the earlier rain delay @entity22 went into the stretch as a two - time major champion and ends it having doubled his haul and claimed his first @entity67 title			1
he has now pulled alongside the likes of @entity85 and @entity86 on the all - time majors list with seemingly all his best years to come			1
he played those 12 rounds in a cumulative total of 48 under , never once going over par and only once — in the final round of @entity17 , where he shot 71 — did he fail to break 70			2
it is worth printing in mind - boggling sequence , for we may never see the like again , given the stature of the tournaments they were delivered in : 66 , 66 , 68 , 71 , 69 , 64 , 66 , 66 , 66 , 67 , 67 , 68			2
the weekend we have just witnessed is right up there with any major you care to mention			0
it boiled down to four ball strikers performing close to the peak of their powers			0
we had a five - time major champion in @entity107 ; @entity108 rewinding the clock a year and @entity110 hoping to show that while the future might be @entity22 green , it will have a fairly prominent hue of orange			1
eyes on the prize : @entity22 will now only ever be compared to @entity47 and @entity48 after his latest win when the back nine began , @entity22 trailed @entity110 and @entity108 by three strokes and @entity107 by two			1
he was out of sorts and looking fatigued after his wondrous stretch of form			0
@entity122 was fading as fast as the light			0
they say the hardest thing is leading a tournament from start to finish but being able to shift momentum over the back nine on sunday might come close			0
after a good drive on the par five 10th , @entity22 still had 284 yards to reach the green			1
if truth be told , on these saturated fairways , if he had flushed it he would n’t have reached			0
but he caught it a fraction thin , causing it to roll on impact , and when the ball stopped it was just seven feet from the flag			0
talk about a shot that changed everything			0
after the resultant eagle he could have birdied the next two holes , then did seize an opportunity at the 13th			0
at the 15th he holed from 20ft to put enormous pressure on the other three			0
come here , you : @entity22 celebrates with his father @entity148 after winning the @entity33 superior technique and belief told on the final holes			1
the 16th is a monstrous par four and it showed , as the two @entity154 flailed wildly			0
@entity107 ran up his first bogey in 22 holes			0
@entity110 , who had bogeyed the 14th , was fortunate not to pay a similar price			0
@entity22 ? he drilled his tee shot so far it finished 17 yards further than anyone else managed on that hole			1
@entity107 went for the green with a wood ; @entity22 had a nine iron			1
he had another at the 17th from a fairway bunker and played it so beautifully it set up another birdie			0
two strokes ahead with just the par five 18th to negotiate			0
they drove off and then allowed @entity22 and his playing partner @entity173 to play their teeshots			1
here , @entity22 got his second piece of luck			1
without the deluge that had caused a suspension and provoked the desperate race against time to finish , his ball would have plunged into a creek ; instead it stayed on the bank			2
elation : @entity22 ranks as the third most successful @entity11 golfer in majors			1
only @entity187 ( five ) and sir @entity188 ( six ) have won more the two @entity190 gentlemen allowed @entity22 to play his second shot as well , which finished in a greenside bunker			1
@entity107 now had to hole an eagle pitch and came mighty close			0
@entity110 , unable to see clearly , cruelly lipped out from short range for a birdie			0
he is just the third man alongside @entity48 and @entity47 ( those two again ) to finish in the top five in all four majors in the same season — but the only one not to win one			1
@entity22 came out of the sand and had two putts from 25ft to win			1
normally , it would have been routine , although not when you can barely see a hand in front of you			0
but he pulled it off and let out a roar of elation			2
at the prize presentation , @entity211 , the @entity212 president , dropped the lid of the massive @entity33 — but trust @entity22 to stoop with all the reflexes of a slip fielder and catch it			1
so ended the 12 rounds of greatness			0
next year the majors are at his two favourite courses — @entity223 and @entity224 — while the @entity212 is at @entity225 in @entity226 , where he was third in 2010			2
do you think there might be a bit of interest as he heads to the masters in april , halfway to the @entity232 and seeking to become only the sixth player to win all four majors ? do feel free to join the ride if you ’re not a golfer			2
all that is needed is an appreciation for someone doing something extraordinarily well			0
we ’re in @entity244 territory here , or @entity245			0
and the most glorious thing of all ? he has only just begun			0
good save : @entity22 dives in to catch the lid of the @entity33 after @entity211 let it slip			1

@entity22 will now only be compared to @entity47 and @entity48
he has pulled alongside the likes of @entity85 and @entity86 on the all - time majors list following his triumph at the @entity33
@entity22 ranks as the third most successful @entity11 golfer in majors . only @entity187 ( five ) and sir @entity188 ( six ) have won more
