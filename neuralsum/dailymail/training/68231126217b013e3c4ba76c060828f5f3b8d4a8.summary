by @entity0 published : 12:17 est , 6 june 2013 updated : 15:45 est , 6 june 2013 a group of climate change protesters who occupied one of the @entity7 ’s new gas - fired power stations for seven days have avoided jail sentences			1
twelve women and nine men aged 23 to 46 from across the country admitted aggravated trespass after their sit - in at the @entity15 power plant in @entity16 last october			1
at an earlier court hearing the group had been warned that all sentencing options were open , but at @entity22 ’ @entity21 today district judge @entity20 told them custodial sentences would not be imposed			2
no @entity25 activists and supporters outside @entity21 before their sentence hearing			2
they had been told they could receive custodial sentences after staging a sit - in at a gas - fired power station he said : ' it is right to say that i took into account the conscientious motives of all of you			1
' how this case is sentenced must be fact - based			1
' the judge said many of the defendants were highly educated men and women who had caring roles in the community , and added : ' your motives were genuine but you knew what the boundaries were			1
' following the announcement that the defendants , some of whom had previous convictions for similar offences , would not be going to prison they cheered and broke into applause in the court room			2
the campaigners from the @entity63 arrived in vans at the site in the early hours of october 29 last year			2
equipped with climbing equipment and with enough food and drink to sustain them for a number of days , they made their way on to the premises through a hole in the security fence			0
they had planned the demonstration for around 10 months , and the action saw 16 activists occupy the flues of two of the chimneys at the site			1
while up there , they rigged a rope between the two chimneys and people were able to travel across and operate a supply line			0
they all handed themselves in to police at various points during and after the week - long @entity93 @entity94 told the court : ' five of the group were on the ground and detained in that way , the rest came down in the course of the next seven days			1
' they were all detained quite peacefully , quite amicably			0
' the group said they were protesting against moves to build new gas - fired power stations such as @entity15 , warning they would leave the @entity7 dependent on a polluting and increasingly expensive fossil fuel for decades			1
the government has backed the development of up to 20 gas - fired power stations as part of its strategy for future energy supplies			1
' your motives were genuine but you knew what the boundaries were , ' - judge @entity20 ministers said that continuing use of gas without technology to trap and permanently store carbon emissions is compatible with targets to cut greenhouse gases to tackle climate change			1
arrests were made between october 29 and november 5 , when the week - long protest came to an end			1
five defendants were given an 18 month conditional discharge and ordered to pay costs of £ 85 and a £ 15 victim surcharge			0
seven others were given community orders for 12 months and told to carry out 200 hours unpaid work			1
the remaining nine were were all given community orders for 12 months and told to carry out 150 hours unpaid work			1
they were all told to pay costs of £ 85 and a victim surcharge of £ 60			0
@entity142 , defending the group , told the judge the defendants had asked him to pass on that the demonstration was not done on a ' whim ' and had been carefully planned			1
' the defendants have asked me to convey this was not a stupid prank , nor was it a self - aggrandising stunt , ' mr @entity142 said			2
' @entity152 of these defendants cares passionately about the damage being done to the planet by climate change			0
' it ’s something that drives them very deeply			0
this was something that had been considered very carefully			0
' the group considered the protest ' necessary ' , mr @entity142 added			0
' the sincerity in the integrity of their motivation is the most important mitigating factor , ' he said			0
the defendants had spent weeks planning and practicing the protest and their climbing techniques , it was non-violent , and no permanent damage was caused , mr @entity142 said			0
asking the judge to not impose custodial sentences , he said some similar cases of political protests had seen individuals ' vindicated by history ' and the defendants had acted out of the ' highest possible motives			0
' operation : the group had planned the demonstration for around 10 months			2
it saw 16 activists occupy the flues of two of the chimneys at the site he told the judge : ' these people must be marked out from the ordinary defendants who come before these courts on a daily basis because they come from conscientious motives			0
' in his sentencing remarks the judge said the ' mass act of aggravated trespass ' had resulted in the loss of around £ 340,000 in labour after 655 workers were turned away from the site during the occupation , and delays in finishing the site cost around £ 5 million			1
a statement released by @entity15 following the sentencing said : ' @entity15 ’s civil case against the protestors was settled in march after they agreed to accept a permanent injunction preventing them from entering multiple @entity15 sites			0
' following this agreement , the company dropped its claim for civil damages against the protestors			0
' @entity15 has invited a range of groups and individuals - including @entity223 - to discuss the company ’s response to such demonstrations in future			2
' this is being led by @entity229 , chairman of @entity15 ’s independent @entity230 , alongside panel member , @entity231			0
' they will also be supported by an independent legal adviser			0
' an advisory report will be presented to the @entity230 and the findings will be published in due course			0
' we share the protestors ’ commitment to tackling climate change			0
that ’s why we have committed to reducing the intensity of @entity244 emissions from our electricity production by 60 per cent by 2020 , and cutting the proportion of @entity244 arising from our customers ’ energy consumption by 15 per cent by 2020			2
' we are @entity7 ’s largest generator of low carbon electricity and our plans to build four new nuclear reactors could generate enough low carbon electricity for about 40 per cent of @entity7 ’s homes			2
' speaking after the sentencing , @entity255 said : ' although - thank goodness - none of us are going to jail , we are still facing penalties for simply standing up for clean , safe and affordable energy			1
' meanwhile , everyone in the country will be facing a disastrously destabilised climate and rocketing fuel bills if we do n’t stop the government ’s reckless dash for gas			1
' the government is putting the profits of the @entity271 energy companies before the fundamental need for a safe and liveable climate for generations to come			1
