asked what he would bring to the role of @entity4 captain , @entity0 kept it simple			1
‘ i ’ll be myself , ’ he said			0
that ’s his first problem			0
there are a lot of people out there who want @entity0 to be anyone but himself when he leads @entity4 out against @entity13			1
frankly , they would want the captain to be anyone bar @entity0			2
@entity0 is the obvious choice for the job now , head and shoulders above any other available candidate			1
yet in reality he is a divisive figure these days			0
half the country thinks @entity4 ’s fortunes still revolve around finding the best use for him ; many of the others would not have him in the squad , let alone the team			2
time to be a leader : @entity0 will captain @entity4 against @entity13 in the friendly on wednesday night skipper : @entity0 was the obvious choice for the job , but in reality these days he is a divisive figure pressure : @entity0 does not deserve the stick , he must lead an inexperienced team with an uninspiring coach usually , the captain unites the country behind him — that was certainly the case when @entity51 had the job , and @entity53			1
@entity0 does not have that blessing			2
@entity55 will be half shut on wednesday night and half empty , such is the paucity of interest in @entity4 ’s first match after @entity60 , and the unveiling of @entity0 as captain did not provoke the hoped - for spike in ticket sales			1
it is not his fault			0
this is an @entity4 team mired in mediocrity and disappointment left over from the @entity71			1
the manager is seen as uninspiring , only remaining in the job because nobody else was available , the players are viewed as flawed , failed or just raw			0
@entity0 is pushing 100 caps ; the next most experienced outfield player in @entity79 ’s starting line - up is barely halfway to 50			1
in these circumstances , @entity0 needs support			2
this is a young squad he will be marshalling towards the @entity85 finals in 2016 — it is unthinkable that @entity4 do not qualify , when even third place out of six is likely to lead to a play - off — and he needs to be an inspirational figure			0
that will be hard if he is to first concentrate on winning the supporters over			0
is the attitude to @entity0 fair ? not really			0
his recent tournament performances have been disappointing — and the @entity98 in particular was poor — but his arrival on the scene in 2004 was perhaps the most exhilarating moment for the national team in almost 20 years , and it would be hard for any player to live up to expectations beyond that			0
tough : it has been difficult for @entity0 to live up to the expectations he set as a teenager get behind him : @entity0 needs support with @entity4 fast approaching the @entity114 qualifiers glory : the striker scored for @entity4 in the unfortunate 2 - 1 defeat to @entity118 at the @entity71 in @entity60 watching on : @entity79 observes as @entity120 and @entity0 train at @entity121 @entity122 was right when he said last week that 2004 was the closest @entity4 have come to winning a tournament in recent years , and it might have happened had @entity0 stayed fit			1
instead , injury early on in a quarter - final with @entity126 — and a poor choice of replacement by @entity129 — denied @entity4			0
@entity0 , and the group , have never been the same since			0
so , amid the gloom , the shrugs , the wide - open spaces on @entity55 ’s top tier , is there hope that @entity4 could recapture the energy from a decade ago ? well , yes , a sliver of light can be found in @entity139			1
@entity0 may have the ultimate honour as captain but he is no longer the most significant player in the @entity4 team			2
@entity139 is the individual who can make the thought of travelling to @entity55 exciting again , @entity139 is the player who could one day make a similar impact to @entity0 in 2004			1
new star : @entity139 is @entity4 's new shining light , @entity147 can make going to @entity55 exciting again impact : @entity139 could have a similar say on things internationally as @entity0 did at @entity151 as a youngster time will tell : the @entity155 winger , 19 , constant influence is perhaps in advance of a young @entity158 @entity139 is 19 , the same age as @entity158 when he had his breakthrough game for @entity161 , the 2004 @entity163 final win over @entity164			1
@entity158 would become a monster in front of goal , while @entity139 ’s ‘ @entity170 ’ finish against @entity169 on sunday suggests he has a road to travel as a match - winner , but his consistent influence on @entity174 matches is perhaps in advance of the teenage @entity158			1
certainly , on his present trajectory , it is not unimaginable that @entity139 could one day replicate the move @entity179 made to @entity180 — or at least attract the attention of @entity183 ’s super elite			0
it is @entity139 , not @entity0 , who should grow to be the key player in this team , and if that takes the pressure off the captain , so much the better			2
it certainly places additional pressure on @entity79 , though , now charged with getting the level of performance from @entity139 that he shows for his club			2
key player : @entity139 was fantastic for @entity4 at the @entity71 , especially in the opener against @entity197 different philosophy : @entity79 must look to get the best out of @entity4 's @entity155 players @entity79 escaped serious criticism from many quarters after the @entity71 — not least the @entity204 , who acted with complacent haste in guaranteeing his job — but at @entity208 on sunday , questions were unavoidable			1
@entity155 looked superb — @entity139 , @entity209 and @entity210 among their best players — yet @entity79 rarely inspires them to reproduce that form for @entity4			1
nor can it be said they are flattered by their foreign clubmates any more			0
@entity155 maintain an @entity218 core and for the first goal , the trio combined successfully in a way they never seem to do for their country			0
@entity0 may be a lightning rod on the message boards and phone - ins , but it is @entity79 ’s duty to get the best out of @entity147 from here			2
this is far from the golden generation , but it is not without its gems .			0

@entity0 divides opinion but was the obvious candidate to be skipper
the striker set such high expectations for himself as a teenager
it was always going to be tough for @entity0 to live up to the hype
@entity139 impressed at the @entity71 and will excite the fans again
the @entity155 winger is capable of similar impact @entity0 had at @entity151
@entity139 , 19 , has a constant influence on games perhaps in advance of a teenage @entity158
@entity79 must try and get the best out of @entity4 's @entity155 players
