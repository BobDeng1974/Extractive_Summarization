by @entity1 reporter published : 15:26 est , 10 march 2013 updated : 02:53 est , 11 march 2013 @entity2 started voting yesterday in a sovereignty referendum seeking to counter @entity5 ’s claim over the @entity7 - ruled territory			1
diplomatic tension between @entity7 and @entity5 has flared more than three decades after the @entity9			2
falklands - born and long - term residents will cast ballots on whether they want to stay a @entity12			0
an overwhelming ' yes ’ vote is likely , prompting @entity5 to dismiss the referendum as a publicity stunt			2
but @entity37 , deputy editor of the islands ’ weekly newspaper , the @entity40 , said : ' we hope the undecideds , or the uninformeds , or those countries that might otherwise be prepared to give the nod to @entity5 ’s sovereignty claim , might have pause for thought after the referendum			2
' this is an attempt to say ' hang on a minute , there ’s another side to the story '			0
' the local @entity53 has mobilised a major effort to get as many of its 1,650 registered voters as possible to cast their secret ballots today and tomorrow a convoy of vehicles bearing @entity7 flags and stickers in favor of keeping the @entity2 as an overseas territory of the @entity7 people queued to vote at the town hall in the capital @entity22 , nearly 8,000 miles from @entity66 , where posters proclaim : ' @entity68 , our choice ’			1
' i have no wish to be part of @entity5 , ’ said @entity73 , 67 , of isolated @entity74 , who voted by post			0
' i consider myself a @entity76 , but my ancestors came from @entity7 , ' he said			0
the post office produced a line of official stamps to mark the occasion			0
in distant islands and far - flung sheep farms , ballot papers were being flown and driven in by mobile polling stations			0
deal with it : @entity5 's aggressive stance has galvanised and cemented patriotic fervour on the islands poll : resident @entity91 stands waiting for his turn to vote outside a polling station in @entity22 @entity95 : a couple arrives with a pram covered with the @entity27 to cast their vote some islanders are the descendants of @entity7 settlers who arrived eight or nine generations ago and the @entity2 retain an unmistakably @entity7 character despite a sizeable community of immigrants from @entity106 and @entity107			1
residents say fiery remarks by @entity5 president @entity110 and her foreign minister , @entity111 , have galvanised patriotic sentiment on the islands , which lie nearly 8,000 miles from @entity66 and just a 75 - minute flight away from southern @entity5			1
referendum volunteer @entity115 leaves the @entity20 with a mobile ballot box to take it to remote polling stations in @entity22 @entity118 : @entity2 flags , featuring a @entity7 flag , were seen all over @entity22 in a show of support @entity7 and proud : @entity123 ( left ) shows off a t - shirt that removes @entity5 from @entity125 as she lines up to cast her vote			1
@entity128 ( right ) wore a dress with the colours of the @entity2 flag a whalebone arch is seen in front of the @entity134 in @entity22			0
@entity5 calls the @entity135 and claims authority over them tensions have risen with the discovery of commercially viable oil resources in the @entity2 basin and by @entity143 ’s persistent demands for @entity7 to hold sovereignty talks over the @entity2 , as the islands are called in @entity5			1
a couple dressed with the colours of the @entity27 join the line of voters the government says it will only agree to negotiations if the islanders want them , which they show no sign of doing			0
@entity111 said last month the referendum had the ' spirit of a public - relations campaign ' and the foreign ministry accused @entity7 of pursuing ' irresponsible initiatives in bad faith '			2
' this new @entity7 attempt to manipulate the @entity135 issue through a vote by the population that it implanted is forcefully rejected by @entity5 ' a ministry statement said			1
there has been broad @entity169 support for @entity5 ’s position			0
@entity5 says the sovereignty dispute can only be decided between @entity66 and @entity172			1
the 10 - week @entity9 killed about 650 @entity5 and 255 @entity7 and ended when @entity5 surrendered			1
it is widely remembered in @entity5 as a humiliating mistake by the brutal and discredited dictatorship ruling at the time			0
no one in @entity5 advocates another attempt to take the islands by force , but some analysts say the current tough strategy may prove counterproductive by antagonising islanders			2
@entity184 : @entity2 go to the polls today to decide whether to remain a @entity7 overseas territory remote : only 2,500 people live in the remote @entity189 territory - which was recaptured by @entity7 troops following an invasion by @entity5 in 1982 victory : @entity193 raise the @entity27 outside @entity194 , in @entity22 , during the @entity9 in 1982			1

islanders vote on remaining overseas territory in two - day referendum
@entity5 *ambassador* to @entity7 says ' vote has no legal grounds '
discovery of oil has *fuelled* tensions between @entity66 and @entity172
turnout is expected to be high , with result due to be announced tonight
