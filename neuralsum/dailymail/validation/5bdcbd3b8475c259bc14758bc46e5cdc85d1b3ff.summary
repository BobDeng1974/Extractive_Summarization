@entity1 manager @entity0 was left furious after his side were denied what he felt was a legitimate goal against @entity5 on tuesday night			2
striker @entity6 stood with his back to goal as opposition goalkeeper @entity9 attempted to take a goal kick during his side 's clash with @entity5 , only for @entity9 's clearance to hit the forward			1
the ball cannoned off the back of the number 13 before hitting the bar , and @entity6 , who was signed by @entity0 from @entity20 outfit @entity19 , then tapped the ball into the empty net			1
@entity6 is standing still outside of the box with his back to goal when the goalkeeper kicks the ball @entity6 and the fans celebrated , but referee @entity29 was quick to disallow the goal and booked the 23 - year - old @entity1 top scorer , much to @entity0 's frustration			1
' i 've got to be very careful with what i say , we 've been in a bit of trouble recently with officials , ' @entity0 told @entity39			0
@entity0 continued : ' @entity6 ( @entity6 ) did that all night			0
he did n't move , did n't follow the keeper , he held his ground and by the laws of the game that is perfectly acceptable			0
it 's a goal that should have stood			0
' @entity1 striker @entity6 just can not believe his goal has been disallowed by referee @entity29 ' you 'll have to ask the referee why the goal was not allowed , i do n't think he had a particularly good game and that 's an understatement			1
' @entity6 was looking the other way , he stood his ground which is allowed and the goalkeeper has kicked it at his back			2
' that 's a real strange decision and ultimately it 's cost us two points			0

@entity6 was denied a goal against @entity5 by referee @entity29
@entity29 instead booked the striker who *slotted* home an *opportunistic* effort
@entity6 was hit by the goalkeeper 's kick and the ball cannoned onto the bar
striker tapped the ball home , but referee @entity29 was having none of it
