president @entity0 nominated @entity1 for the top spot at the @entity3 on wednesday , in a move that would see the central bank led by a woman for the first time if she is confirmed			1
@entity0 introduced @entity1 as a ' proven leader ' who is ' tough , not just because she 's from @entity9			1
' he credited the current @entity3 second in command for being a consensus builder , adding : ' she understands the human cost when people ca n't find a job			0
the pair appeared alongside the president at the @entity20 when mr. @entity0 will made the formal announcement			1
' @entity24 is the epitome of calm , and against the volatility of global markets he 's been a voice of wisdom and a steady hand , ' @entity0 said			1
@entity1 , 67 , emerged as the leading candidate after @entity41 , a former treasury secretary whom @entity0 was believed to favor , withdrew from the contest last month			1
a close ally of mr @entity24 , she has played a key part in keeping interest rates low to support the economy			1
in accepting the nomination , @entity1 said more still needs to be done to strengthen the recovery			0
she said the past six years have been tumultuous for the economy and challenging for many @entity50			0
she said that while the recovery is not complete , ' we have made progress , the economy is stronger and the financial system is sounder			2
' ' we have made progress , the economy is stronger and the financial system is sounder , ' @entity1 said as she accepted the nomination it is believed she will continue the work started by her predecessor , when he steps aside in january			1
the announcement comes as the country is gripped by a partial economic shutdown and the looming breach of the nation 's $ 16.7 trillion borrowing limit			2
the president has criticised republicans for demanding either changes in health care or spending policies , in return for paying for government operations and raising the debt ceiling			2
shutdown : president @entity0 is not expected to use @entity1 's nomination as an opportunity to score points but sources at the @entity20 said @entity0 was unlikely to use @entity1 's nomination announcement as an opportunity to score political points on the shutdown			1
@entity88 chief economist , @entity87 , argued the timing of the announcement has probably been designed to send a signal of policy stability to the financial markets			1
investors are growing increasingly concerned over the shutdown and what they believe will be the larger threat of a default on @entity100 debt if @entity101 does not raise the borrowing limit by the time it hits it on october 17			0
mr @entity87 said : ' markets are very unsettled and they are likely to become even more unsettled in coming days			0
' providing some clarity around who will be the next @entity3 chairman should help at least at the margin			2
' becoming vice chairman in 2010 , @entity1 helped to balance the bank 's traditional method of exerting control over the economy through short - term rates , with the unconventional programs it launched to help steer the economy through the financial meltdown of 2008			1
these included monthly bond purchases and guidance to investors about the likely direction of rates			2
after the financial crisis erupted in 2008 , under @entity24 's leadership the bank created programmes that are credited with helping save the @entity50 banking system			1
it lent money to banks after credit markets froze , cut its key short - term interest rate to near zero and bought trillions in bonds to lower long - term borrowing rates			2
task ahead : @entity1 will be taking over at a time when the @entity3 will roll back its support for other banks senator @entity141 , who heads the @entity142 , which must approve @entity1 's nomination , said he would work with the panel 's members to advance her confirmation quickly			0
he added : ' she has a depth of experience that is second to none , and i have no doubt she will be an excellent @entity3 chairman			2
' senator @entity152 , a committee member , described @entity153 as ' an excellent choice '			0
@entity0 's choice of @entity1 coincides with a key turning point for the @entity3			1
in the coming months it is expected to start slowing the pace of its @entity100 and mortgage bond purchases as the economy starts to recover			2
boss : current chairman @entity24 is due to step down in january after eight years at the helm the program had been intended to keep loan rates low to encourage borrowing and spending			1
while economists were united in their view that @entity1 's appointment was a strong signal of continuity , she will inherit the difficult task of rolling the bank 's support without causing major financial market upheaval			0
@entity178 chief economist @entity177 said : ' @entity1 is not going to rock the boat in terms of her approach to monetary policy			2
but it will be her challenge to reverse this prolonged and unprecedented period of monetary ease			0
' even after the bond buying programme is scaled back , the bank 's policies will remain geared toward keeping borrowing rates low to help stimulate growth and cut unemployment , which currently stands at 7.3 per cent			0
few expect to see the short - term rate increase much before 2015			2
@entity1 had long been considered a logical candidate for the chairmanship in part because of her expertise as an economist , her years as a top bank regulator and her experience in helping manage the bank 's polices			1
before the crisis struck , she was among a minority of top economists who predicted subprime mortgages posed a severe threat to the economy			0
new dawn : if she is successful , @entity1 will become the first woman to head the @entity3 in its history as vice-chairman , @entity1 has built a reputation as a ' dove ' - someone who is typically more concerned about keeping interest rates low to reduce unemployment than about raising them to avoid high inflation			0
her nomination could face resistance from congressional critics who argue that the bank 's low - rate policies have raised the risk of high inflation and lead to bubbles in property and assets , such as stocks			0
@entity228 senator @entity228 of @entity229 , member of the @entity230 , said he voted against her for vice chairman in 2010 because of her dovish policies			1
he said : ' i am not aware of anything that demonstrates her views have changed			0
' @entity1 has pledged that when the economy finally begins growing faster she will begin to increase rates to prevent high inflation			0
@entity1 drew outspoken support from @entity241 , a third of whom signed a letter this summer urging @entity0 to choose her			1
and last month , more than 350 economists signed a letter to @entity0 urging him to nominate @entity1			1
if confirmed by the @entity142 , @entity1 would be the first @entity245 chosen to lead the bank since @entity247 was appointed by @entity248 in 1979			0
and she would also be the first vice chairman of the @entity3 to go on and be appointed to the top spot			1
dove : @entity1 would prefer to keep interest rates low to avoid unemployment @entity1 served as a board member for three years in the 1990s before leaving to head the @entity253 in the @entity255 administration			0
she also served for six years as president of the @entity3 's regional bank in @entity258 before @entity0 chose appointed her to the number two spot on the seven - member board in @entity263			1
@entity1 , like @entity24 , was a distinguished college economics professor before she joined the central bank			1
she taught at the @entity265 in @entity266 between 1980 and 1994 when the then president @entity255 chose her to join the @entity267 in @entity263			0
she served on the board of governors until february 1997 , when president @entity255 chose her to lead the @entity271			0
if she is successfully appointed to the role , @entity1 would not only be the first woman to head the @entity50 central bank ; she also would be the first woman ever to head a major central bank anywhere in the world .			0

the vice chairman will succeed @entity24 to the top spot if confirmed
