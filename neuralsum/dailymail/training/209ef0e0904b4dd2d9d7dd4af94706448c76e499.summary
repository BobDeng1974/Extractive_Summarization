giant rats , the size of cows or even bigger , could one day fill a ‘ significant chunk ’ of @entity5 ’s emptying ecospace			1
the terrifying scenario could become a reality as super-adaptable rats take advantage of larger mammals becoming extinct , an expert predicts			2
‘ animals will evolve , over time , into whatever designs will enable them to survive and to produce offspring , ’ said geologist dr @entity12 , from the @entity13			1
rats could grow to the size of cows or even bigger as they evolve to fill vacant ecological niches , it is claimed			1
pictured here is the capybara - the largest rodent in the world rats are one of the best examples of a species that humans have helped spread around the world			1
they have successfully adapted to many of the new environments they have found themselves in - they are now on most islands and continue to prosper and adapt			2
the result is that each island that rats are now present on is in effect a laboratory of future evolution – and each will produce different adaptive results over time			0
dr @entity12 suggests that as ecospace empties , rats will continue to re-fill a significant chunk of it in the mid to far geological future			1
given enough time , rats could grow to be at least as large as the capybara , the world ’s largest rodent			2
for instance , in the @entity57 , when the dinosaurs lived , there were mammals , but these were very small , rat and mouse - sized , because dinosaurs occupied the larger ecological niches			1
only once the dinosaurs were out of the way did these tiny mammals evolve into many different forms			0
‘ given enough time , rats could probably grow to be at least as large as the capybara , the world ’s largest rodent , that lives today , that can reach 80 kilos ( 17lb )			1
‘ if the ecospace was sufficiently empty , then they could get larger still			1
’ the largest extinct rodent known , @entity72 , which lived three million years ago , was larger than a bull and weighed over a tonne			2
like its modern - day relative , the sheep - sized capybara , it lived in @entity79			0
a hint of the nightmare to come can be seen on ‘ rat islands ’ - isolated regions where rats introduced by humans have quickly risen to become the dominant species			1
dr @entity12 predicts that rats could one day become equal to , or bigger , than cows			1
the average cow is around 147 cm ( 58 inches ) in height and 152cm ( 60 inches ) in length the largest extinct rodent known , @entity72 , which lived three million years ago , was larger than a bull and weighed over a tonne rat islands act as a ‘ laboratory ’ for studying the future evolution of the rodents , according to dr @entity12			1
‘ rats are one of the best examples of a species that we have helped spread around the world , and that have successfully adapted to many of the new environments that they found themselves in , ’ he said			1
‘ they are now on many , if not most , islands around the world - and once there , have proved extraordinarily hard to eradicate			1
if giant rats sounds far - fetched , imagine a world with giant snakes as long as buses that are so fat that they can only just squeeze through the door			2
turtles the size of @entity121 would hunt crocodiles , while horses as small as cats could be found roaming fields			0
this was @entity5 around 55 million years ago , according to @entity128 researchers who have been studying the link between the size of animals , reptiles and a change in climate			0
last year , scientists warned massive reptiles and shrinking mammals could be found on our planet again if global warming takes hold			0
@entity142 , a paleontologist at the @entity143 , told a conference in @entity145 that there is a clear link between global warming and unusual animal fossils			0
dr @entity142 has been looking at a period known as the @entity151 which occurred around 55 million years ago			0
at this time global temperatures rose by about 6 ° c over a period of 200,000 years			0
dr @entity142 has seen evidence of these strange creature first hand			0
last year he helped discover 60 - million - year - old @entity79 giant turtle that lived in what is now @entity159			0
given enough time , rats could probably grow to be at least as large as the capybara , the world 's largest rodent , that lives today			2
it can reach 80 kilos ( 17lb ) and is shown in between the baby lama and runner duck ‘ they ’re often there for good , essentially			0
once there , they have out - competed many native species and at times have driven them to extinction			2
‘ as a result , ecospace is being emptied , and rats are in a good position to re-fill a significant chunk of it , in the mid to far geological future			1
’ gigantism is a well - known evolutionary response that occurs when a small creature steps into an ecological niche left by a larger species			1
fifty million years ago , a distant ancestor of the blue whale was the size of a wolf , dr @entity12 pointed out			0
he expected rats to adapt in a host of other ways , besides some of them growing to a large size			0
a hint of the nightmare to come can be seen on ' rat islands ' - isolated regions where rats introduced by humans have quickly risen to become the dominant species ‘ animals can evolve to smaller as well as larger sizes , ’ he said			1
‘ this will depend on what particular circumstances they find themselves in and what the selective pressures on them are			0
‘ each island that rats are now present on is in effect a laboratory of future evolution , and each will produce different results			0
‘ so there will be future thin rats , future fat rats , slow and heavy rats , fast and ferocious rats , probably future aquatic rats - the list goes on			2
‘ other animals will likely follow the same pattern , such as domestic cats , rabbits , goats and more			0
; he suspects that rats will have a major influence on the geological future of the @entity5 and over time were likely to produce ‘ some remarkable descendants ’ .			2

@entity12 from @entity13 says rats will grow to 176lb
‘ if ecospace was sufficiently empty , then they could get larger still , ' he said
