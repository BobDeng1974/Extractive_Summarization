the @entity0 will finally be righted next week in the largest and most expensive maritime salvage operation in history			0
the cost of lifting the giant cruise liner , which sank off the coast of @entity7 in january 2012 , off the sea bed , has ballooned to £ 500million - a figure that could rise if there are problems , organisers admitted			1
thirty - two people died when the ship , with 4,200 passengers onboard , hit rocks and ran aground off the island of @entity17 after an ill - judged ' salute ' to inhabitants by the ship ’s captain			1
thirty two people died when the ship hit rocks and ran aground off the island of @entity17 in january 2012 after an ill - judged ' salute ' to inhabitants by the ship 's captain stricken : salvage ships circle around the wreck of @entity0 as it lies on its side next to @entity17 in this aerial picture taken from an @entity42 navy helicopter salvage : 500 engineers and 18,000 tonnes of cement will be used to try to haul the @entity0 from its current resting place on its side next to @entity17 the enormous operation , to pull the ship off the reef where it capsized , is due to start at dawn on monday , weather permitting , and will take 10 to 12 hours , with 500 people working on the project			1
the @entity0 is currently lying on its side on an underwater reef			2
an underwater platform has been built on which the ship will come to rest as a system of jacks and underwater cables haul it upright			1
uncharted territory : the international team of engineers will use a never - before attempted strategy to set upright the luxury liner tragic : the giant wreck of @entity0 has lain partly submerged in shallow waters off the @entity7 island of @entity17 since the accident in january 2012 huge task : the @entity0 cruise ship could be upright again next week , nearly two years after the liner capsized and killed at least 30 people the @entity0 is currently lying on its side on an underwater reef			1
an underwater platform has been built on which the ship will come to rest as a system of jacks and cables haul it upright the enormous operation , to pull the ship off the reef where it capsized , is due to start at dawn on monday , weather permitting , and will take 10 to 12 hours , with 500 people working on the project			1
above , a graphic of how the ship is stricken on the reef it will be rolled onto the platform in a manoeuvre known as parbuckling			1
workers will look for the bodies of two people , an @entity42 and an @entity101 unaccounted for since the disaster , as machines haul the 114,000 - tonne ship upright and underwater cameras comb the seabed			1
assuming seas are calm , the ship will be slowly pulled to the vertical in an hours - long operation so it can be towed to a mainland port and turned into scrap dozens of crank - like pulleys will start slowly rotating the ship upright at a rate of about 3 metres per hour			1
steel chains weighing 17,000 tons have been looped under the vessel to help pull it upright			2
tanks filled with water on the exposed side will also help rotate it upward the 114,00 - tonne ship will be rolled onto the platform in a manoeuvre known as parbuckling unprecedented : the cost of refloating the @entity0 has risen to £ 500million and has involved 500 engineers @entity127 : an aerial view shows the huge scale of @entity0 - equivalent to a floating city - set against the backdrop of the houses on @entity17 an international team of engineers and other experts has devised no ' @entity136 ' if the attempt to right the hulking wreck goes wrong and the cruise liner splits apart or falls back on its side			1
assuming seas are calm , the ship will be slowly pulled to the vertical in an hours - long operation so it can be towed to a mainland port and turned into scrap			1
the possibility that the ship might fall apart is a ' remote event ' , insisted @entity150 , head of @entity42 's @entity151 , at a briefing to lay out logistics			2
' if the ship does n't turn back upright , there is no other way to try it again , ' he said			1
the reef sliced a 70m ( 230ft ) long gash into a side of the hull , seawater rushed in and the @entity0 began to lean over on one side , listing so quickly that many lifeboats could n't be lowered to help save the 4,200 passengers and cruise aboard the pleasure cruise			0
many of @entity17 's 1,500 inhabitants work or go to school on the mainland , and authorities will let one last ferry sail from the island at dawn on monday			1
but no ferries or other boats will be allowed until the effort is completed			0
if seas are rough , or a storm looms , the ship 's rotation will be postponed to a later day next week			2
divers have pumped 18,000 tonnes of cement into bags below the ship to support it and prevent it from breaking up			1
a buoyancy device acting ' like a neck brace for an injured patient ' will hold together the ship 's bow , and fishing nets will catch debris as it rises from beneath the ship , said @entity196 , senior salvage master at @entity197			2
the salvage team will go through the ship cabin by cabin and hand over items found on board to the @entity42 state prosecutor , and the vessel will be towed away to be dismantled			0
the greatest fear for environmentalists is that the ship will break up under the massive force needed to haul it upright			1
the @entity210 for the @entity211 have also highlighted the danger of pollution as thousands of tonnes of water inside the ship pours out			2
the ship ’s fuel has been removed over months by divers and construction workers toiling 24 hours a day , but chemicals and toxins from rotting food and drink remain			1
@entity225 , the @entity226 of @entity7 , said it ‘ will provide a sampling of the water in the affected area both during the rotation and in the days to follow , in order to identify the extent , the extension and duration of pollution			2
’ mr @entity196 admitted that there are risks - but once the operation begins , there is no way to stop it			0
‘ once you start lifting her off the reef , you have already gone beyond the point of no return , ’ he said			0
national civil protection agency head @entity150 said : ' this scale of operation has never been attempted before			0
' like all things that have never been done before , there are elements of uncertainty			0
' he added : ' the theory that the wreck will break is a remote possibility			0
' what ’s more likely is the possibility of spills			0
' specific plans have been put in place if that happens			0
' eventually , in a secondary operation , the cruise liner will be refloated and towed away to be broken up for scrap metal			0
four @entity0 crew members and a @entity267 company official were sentenced to jail in july for their part in the accident , and the ship 's captain @entity273 remains on trial for manslaughter and causing the loss of the ship			2
the captain is accused of abandoning ship before all crew and passengers had been rescued			2
a coastguard 's angry phone order to him - ' get back on board , damn it ! ' - became a catchphrase in @entity42 after the accident			0
four @entity0 crew members and a @entity267 company official were sentenced to jail in july for their part in the accident , and the ship 's captain @entity273 ( above ) remains on trial for manslaughter and causing the loss of the ship passengers onboard the cruise ship @entity0 wait to be evacuated after it ran aground pulleys , rotation and steel chains : the art of parbuckling a 500 - member salvage team from 24 nations will be conducting the operation to move the ship , known in nautical terms as parbuckling , before the autumn storm season arrives , when winds and powerful waves risk battering it to the point it wo n't hold together			1
dozens of crank - like pulleys will start slowly rotating the ship upright at a rate of about 3metres per hour			1
steel chains weighing 17,000 tons have been looped under the vessel to help pull it upright			0
tanks filled with water on the exposed side will also help rotate it upward			0
although parbuckling is a tested way to set upright capsized vessels , the operation has never been applied to a huge cruise liner			0
the ship 's fuel has been removed over months by divers and construction workers toiling 24 hours a day , but chemicals and toxins from rotting food and drink remain mr @entity196 said the @entity0 will suffer an ' extreme amount of force ' of compression in the first part of the manoeuvre			2
he is ' pretty satisfied ' the vessel will survive the stress , adding : ' we expect her to come up to vertical '			0
' she 's resting in pristine waters on this hill ' of two massive pieces of sloping granite seabed , @entity341 said			0
tension : observers will hold their breath during the difficult and never - before - tried operation to salvage the @entity0 is attempted he likened the ship 's hull bottom to a ' big belly ... about the size of a football field ' perched on the two reefs			2
months ago , divers inserted cement - filled bags and grouting between the reefs to provide more stability			1
the aim of the parbuckling is to set the wreck upright on an underwater platform that has been installed			1
' the objective is to get her to move very slowly and gently , ' @entity341 said			0
engineers indicated they would be anxiously watching the early parts of the effort			0
once the ship moves upward some 25 degrees , @entity341 said : ' at that point , gravity takes over , and at that point , we start feeling relief			0
