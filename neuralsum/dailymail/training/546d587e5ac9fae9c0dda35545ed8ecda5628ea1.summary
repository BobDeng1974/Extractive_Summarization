but it seems that one of the world 's smallest primates , the cotton - top tamarin , has a lot to say behind the backs of zookeepers			1
keepers at @entity14 's @entity13 have recorded the chattering whispers of non-human primates for the first time ever			1
scroll down for sound clip keepers at @entity14 's @entity13 set out to record the primate 's alarm calls when they were scared of people , but instead discovered the cotton - top tamarins ( pictured ) seemingly fell silent when a distrusted zoo worker entered their enclosure they set out to record the primate 's alarm calls used when they are scared of people , but instead discovered the monkeys seemingly fell silent when a distrusted zoo worker entered their enclosure			1
however , when the keepers analysed their recordings - or audio spectrograms - at a later date , they were shocked to discover that the animals were communicating very quietly in whispers , io9 reported			1
researchers @entity37 and @entity38 who published their findings in the journal @entity42 , said the whispering could be evidence of convergent evolution in communication strategies used by social and cooperative species			1
the small cotton - top tamarins might whisper to each other in the tropical forests of northwestern @entity51 in @entity52 where they live			1
in another study , scientists suggest why apes do not have any musical talent , when humans , parrots , small birds , elephants and whales do			2
@entity62 , senior physician at the @entity63 at @entity64 , believes the ability to mimic and imitate things like music and speech is the result of the fact that synchronised group movement makes it possible to perceive sounds from the surroundings better			0

the researchers said the whispering could be evidence of convergent evolution in communication strategies used by social and cooperative species the study asserts that the evolution of vocal learning , including musical traits , is influenced by the need of a species to deal with the disturbing sounds that are created in connection with locomotion			1
dr @entity62 said : ' when several people with legs of roughly the same length move together , we tend to unconsciously move in rhythm			0
when our footsteps occur simultaneously , a brief interval of silence occurs			0
' in the middle of each stride we can hear our surroundings better			0
it becomes easier to hear a pursuer , and perhaps easier to conduct a conversation as well			0
' so it follows that apes in treetops and on the ground move unpredictably and irregularly and when humans made the transition to walking on two legs , the sounds of their movements became significantly more predictable , making it possible for them to listen to nature better and thereby increase their chances of survival			0
in another study , scientists have found out why apes like the @entity129 pictured , do not have any musical talent , when humans , parrots , small birds , elephants and whales do dr @entity62 explained that a behaviour that has survival value tends to produce dopamine , sometimes known as the ' reward molecule '			2
in dangerous terrain , this could result in the stimulation of rhythmic movements and enhanced listening to surrounding sounds in nature			2
if that kind of synchronised behaviour was rewarding in dangerous environments it may as well have been rewarding for the brain in relative safety , resulting in activities such as hand - clapping , foot - stamping and yelping around the campfire			2
from there it was just a short step to dance and rhythm and the hormone dopamine flows when we listen to music .			0
