by @entity0 @entity2 ’s mother yesterday called for a memorial to be built where her soldier son was brutally murdered			1
on the first anniversary of the @entity8 hero being hacked to death by cleaver - wielding @entity11 fanatics , @entity5 said a permanent monument would mark his ‘ sacrifice and pain ’ in a proper way			1
but council chiefs and mps have rejected calls for a site of remembrance			1
some cite fears that it will inflame racial tensions and become a focus for @entity11 and far - right extremists			1
‘ a year on and you would never know @entity2 ’s murder had happened , ’ she said , fighting back tears			1
‘ there is nothing there to represent the sacrifice and pain my son suffered			2
‘ the concerns that a memorial would attract extremists are a little late now			1
the terrorists did their worst when they killed my son			2
‘ by refusing to honour his memory in a dignified fashion , they are creating a platform for further political hatred and unrest			0
‘ @entity2 was a peaceful boy and we will never let his name be tarnished			1
‘ i only wish the politicians blocking his memorial could see the damage they are doing			0
they should be getting behind the wishes of most @entity66 people and honouring our heroes , not forgetting them			0
’ @entity2 , 25 , of the @entity68 , had served his country courageously on the dusty battlefields of @entity8 , risking his life facing @entity73 bullets and roadside bombs			1
@entity2 , 25 , of the @entity68 , had served his country courageously on the dusty battlefields of @entity8 but , having survived the deployment unscathed , the father - of - one was murdered on the supposedly safe streets of @entity35 on may 22 last year			1
in scenes of almost unimaginable horror , he was run over then stabbed to death in front of horrified onlookers in a gruesome attack by two @entity85 - inspired maniacs			1
the pair , known to the security services , shouted ‘ @entity88 ’ – @entity89 for ‘ @entity90 is great ’ – as they mercilessly killed the defenceless serviceman			0
@entity93 , 29 , and @entity94 , 22 , were later convicted of the murder and jailed for life			0
a bronze memorial is being built in @entity99 ’s home town of @entity100 , near @entity101 , and his name will be inscribed on a monument for fallen servicemen at the @entity105 , @entity106			0
but nothing has been planned to commemorate the soldier in @entity109 , where he died			0
nothing has been planned to commemorate the soldier in @entity109 where @entity2 died more than 12,000 people have signed a petition organised by the @entity115 campaign to raise money to build a plinth there			1
a number of religious groups , including the @entity121 and the @entity122 , have supported the campaign			0
but local @entity124 mp @entity123 has warned that a memorial could attract ‘ undesirable interest from extremists ’			1
far - right groups could use it to stir up hatred against @entity131 and it might provoke jihadists into recruiting more terrorists , he said			2
the local council , the @entity134 , and the @entity135 have said the family are ‘ not seeking an additional memorial ’ in @entity139			2
@entity93 ( left ) and @entity94 ( right ) were later convicted of the murder and jailed for life but they have been dealing with @entity99 ’s next - of - kin , his wife @entity143			2
they later split up and the soldier had found new love with fiancee @entity148 , a military policewoman			0
yesterday a council spokesman said it had conducted its dealings through the @entity135 after receiving a number of bogus letters claiming to be from @entity156 ’s relatives			2
the spokesman added : ‘ the leader of the council is writing to @entity2 ’s family today to establish direct contact with them and to ensure we can work alongside them as they continue to remember @entity2 and the sacrifice he made for his country			1
’ as crowds gathered in @entity139 , a private event was being held by @entity169 , her partner @entity170 – fusilier @entity2 ’s stepfather – his sisters @entity173 and @entity175 , and widow @entity143 , with whom he had a son @entity176 , three			1
in an interview , mrs @entity5 said she was haunted by visions of her son ’s death and had paid a midnight visit to his grave as she fought grief			2
she said : ‘ no parent should ever have to bury a child but the nature of @entity2 ’s death was so violent that i can barely sleep at night , haunted by the images of my child lying bloodied and fatally wounded on the street @entity193 at the scene of @entity2 's death to mark the one year anniversary of his death ‘ if i close my eyes i see @entity2 covered in blood			1
and when i do fall asleep i have nightmares in which i am running to try to save my son			0
‘ i wake up in cold sweats with my heart thumping and feel like i am going to die			0
the grief is so intense it makes my body hurt physically			0
i do n’t think i will ever get over my @entity2 ’s murder			1
’ she described walking to his grave one cold and rainy night for the comfort of being close to the soldier			0
‘ i sat for half an hour beside his tombstone and sobbed in the dark			0
i talked to him as if he were still alive and told him how much i loved him			0
it was a very bleak and lonely time because the pain just would n’t go away			0
‘ every day is like being trapped in hell and it does n’t get any better			0
’ mrs @entity5 last saw @entity156 on easter sunday , march 31 last year - and seven weeks later he was dead			2
she said : ‘ i still keep thinking @entity2 is going to burst through the door with a huge grin on his face			1
‘ then i remember he has gone for ever			0
and i recall how he met his death and another giant wave of pain and sorrow engulfs me			2
