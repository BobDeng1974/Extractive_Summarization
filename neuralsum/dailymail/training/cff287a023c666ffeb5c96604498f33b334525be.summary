by naming mothers the victims can be identified , which is illegal @entity3 is facing a criminal investigation for tweeting names that may identify victims of paedophile rock star @entity7			1
a court order was made to grant lifelong anonymity to two children whose mothers allowed @entity7 to abuse them			1
but yesterday miss @entity3 , daughter of @entity13 singer @entity12 , broke the order by naming their mothers to her 161,000 followers on @entity18			1
only 24 hours previously , miss @entity3 had been lecturing the @entity43 about invading people ’s privacy			0
naming the mothers could lead to the identification of the children , which is why the court called them only woman a and @entity51 singer @entity7 was branded a ‘ determined and committed paedophile ’ after he pleaded guilty on tuesday to a string of sex offences , including the attempted rape of a baby			1
warning : the attorney general 's office has now tweeted to say that tweeting the names could be a criminal offence the 36 - year - old , from @entity61 , @entity62 , plotted the abuse with the two mothers in text and internet messages			1
yesterday morning miss @entity3 , 24 , ranted to her followers : ‘ the papers must name “ woman @entity69 ” who offered up their babies to this monster			2
’ facing questions : @entity3 tweeted the names , but they were later deleted when no newspaper took up her suggestion , she decided to publish the banned details herself , after reportedly reading them on a @entity81 - based website			1
she tweeted : ‘ the names are ... ’ and wrote both mothers ’ full names , before adding : ‘ what sick , horrible women ’			1
miss @entity3 was warned by fellow @entity18 users that her actions were in breach of a court order , to which she replied : ‘ how ? ? ? ’ it is understood the message remained online for four hours before it was deleted			2
@entity18 users branded her an ‘ idiot ’			0
last night a spokesman for attorney general @entity96 said : ‘ we understand that the names of the co-defendants in the @entity7 case were posted online but have now been removed			1
‘ as has been previously reported , the co-defendants were the mothers of the victims			2
‘ victims of sexual offences have automatic lifetime anonymity and the publication of names or information which can lead to their being identified is a criminal offence			2
this is a police matter			1
’ detective chief inspector @entity110 , of @entity42 , said : ‘ we are currently in consultation with the @entity112 regarding the matter and will take action if appropriate			1
’ only a day earlier , miss @entity3 was taking the moral high ground over the @entity43 , accusing newspapers of being ‘ intrusive ’ for reporting the court proceedings concerning @entity119 ’s alleged drug - taking			2
@entity7 was dated @entity120 ( pictured together in 2008 ) and @entity121 she tweeted : ‘ it ’s at times like this that i wish that the press would not intrude into celebrities ’ private lives on this degree			2
did we learn nothing from the phone hacking scandal ? ’ she apparently failed to appreciate that the court case involving miss @entity119 is open to the public and is being widely reported on all media outlets			2
the judge even took the unusual step of encouraging the media to apply for all reporting restrictions to be lifted – and then granting that request			0
by contrast , the judge in the @entity7 case made certain there were restrictions in place on what could be reported , which were automatically adhered to by the professional journalists covering the court			1
miss @entity3 , who has two young sons with rocker husband @entity150 , works as a journalist , writing columns for @entity153 and @entity154 and articles for @entity156			0

@entity170 , who is from @entity183 and close to the @entity173 family , will also have to pay £ 3,000 in costs			0
he admitted disobeying a january 2001 injunction binding on the whole world which prohibits the publication of any information alleging to identify the appearance , whereabouts , movements or new identities of @entity194 or @entity195 , who were convicted of the two - year - old ’s murder in november 1993			2

as speculation raged over his identity , mrs @entity225 posted on @entity18 : ‘ why is @entity228 trending ? * innocent face * ’ the allegation was without foundation and @entity228 announced that he would pursue those who libelled him			0
