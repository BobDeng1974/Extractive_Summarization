the mystery man who inspired @entity1 by shoveling snow from the marathon finish line on tuesday has been identified following a social media hunt			1
@entity5 , a 25 - year - old bartender , said he had been clearing snow from outside @entity7 , where he works , when he decided to head to the finish line to shovel there too			1
' the finish line is my favorite spot in the whole city so i wanted to go down there and dig it out because i do n't think it deserves to be covered in snow , ' he told the today show on thursday			1
' obviously it holds a special place in everybody in @entity1 's heart but for me it was more about the spirit of the @entity24 and the incredible amount of encouragement and positivity that surrounds the event and how much people , including myself , just love the race			1
on tuesday afternoon , @entity43 was working in a nearby hotel room overlooking the street , when he snapped a photo of @entity5 shoveling the snow and posted it to @entity48			1
' i thought it was a powerful image when i looked at it , ' @entity43 told today			1
' i 've been a resident of @entity52 my whole life			1
for us , that finish line has become sacred ground			1
' @entity57 then released photographs on their social media of the mystery man and called for help identifying him using the hashtag # @entity63			1
@entity7 , which is located about two blocks away from the finish line , identified the shoveler as @entity5			1
dig it : photos taken by @entity43 , who was working in a hotel nearby , were shared around social media , making it onto the @entity48 of the @entity57 , who helped spread the word @entity75 please : the mystery man who shoveled off the marathon finish line on @entity41 during @entity78 was identified as local bartender @entity5 @entity5 , who was initially unaware of the search to find him because he does not have a @entity48 account , said he was shocked by the attention and does n't want to be hailed as a hero			1
he told @entity84 he simply ' wanted to do a good deed for the community because i love @entity1 '			1
he added that he also loved the marathon , which he ran in 201 after falling under more than two feet of snow that knocked out power in some areas , @entity89 is bracing for a second round of heavy snowfall			1
forecasts predict that up to 12 inches of snow is on the way for friday , and sunday and monday will bring down a wintry mix of snow and rain			1
hardest hit in the storm were the towns of @entity103 and @entity104 , just south of @entity105 , where storm surge breached an eight - foot flood wall at high tide - coating houses with icy seawater from below - as frost and snow blanketed them from above			1
the flooding sank parked car and flooded roads - forcing the @entity116 to evacuate some residents before high tide caused even more flooding again early this morning			1
buried : residents spent wednesday digging out cars and sidewalks in @entity1 , after the storm dumped more than two feet in some areas frosted over : these coastal homes in @entity104 , @entity52 , on the @entity126 , were coated in ice from sea spray and flooding caused by a massive storm sturge some 36 inches of snow fell in @entity131 and @entity132 , @entity52			1
elsewhere , blasts of wind topped 75mph			1
in @entity1 , @entity78 dumped 26 inches on many streets , with 30mph overnight winds			1
the total is two inches shy of the all - time record			1
the storm punched a gaping hole in a seawall and swamped a vacant home in @entity103 , @entity52 , and flipped a 110 - foot replica of a revolutionary war ship in @entity145 , @entity146 , snapping its mast and puncturing its hull			1
@entity149 , @entity146 , got 26.5 inches			1
more than 20 inches piled up in @entity150 , @entity151 , and 33.5 inches in @entity152 , @entity153			1
@entity156 , on the eastern end of @entity155 , got about 30 inches			1
two deaths , both on @entity155 , were tied to the storm by police : a 17 - year - old who crashed into a light pole while snow - tubing down a street and an 83 - year - old man with dementia who was found dead in his backyard			1
lived to tell the tale : @entity169 was gashed in the face when a wave shattered a window of his house in @entity103 , and he had to be rescued by front - end loader and then @entity175 getting around : this morning commuter needed skis to navigate the waterfront in @entity179 , @entity52			1
the @entity1 skyline can be seen in the background the @entity184 nuclear plant in @entity185 , @entity52 , was shut down after two transmission lines were damaged in the storm - though the plant remained safe , the @entity182 reports			1
' i had to jump out the window because the door only opens one way , ' @entity189 said in the hard - hit central @entity52 town of @entity195			1
' i felt like a kid again			1
when i was a kid , we 'd burrow through snow drifts like moles			1
' @entity200 was spared the brunt of the storm - despite forecasters predicting so much doom and gloom at the governor shut down the subway system , the first time ever for snow , and the mayor closed all roads on monday night and tuesday morning			1
however , just a few inches of snow fell in the city			1
bitter cold in @entity89 threatens to complicate efforts to clear clogged streets and restore power to more than 15,000 customers shivering in the dark , including the entire island of @entity221			2
a 78 mph wind gust was reported there , and a 72 mph one on neighboring @entity224			2
the low in @entity1 on wednesday was expected to be 10 degrees , with a wind chill of minus 5			2
forecasters warned that it wo n't get above freezing for a week			2
