foul : a miner breaks up chunks of sulphur on the side of the @entity16 volcano complex in @entity11 danger : the intrepid locals scramble over risky rock faces and brave sheer drops with their precious cargo haul : @entity34 is used in a number of common industrial processes such as manufacturing cosmetics and plastics they make their way around a 200 - metre - deep lake bubbling with sulphuric acid to gather the valuable substance , which is used in a number of industrial processes			1

the quietly active volcano emits gases through fumaroles inside the crater , and local miners have tapped those gases to earn a living , ' he said			1
unbearable : a miner works hard at excavating the mineral as he is surrounded by hot gasses taking a breather : one of the miners wipes his face with his shirt as he pauses from his labours @entity68 : but this man carrying 3kg of sulphur will have been paid just a few pounds per day starting again : miners walk back down to the crater with empty baskets to pick up another load of sulphur ' @entity77 and ceramic pipes cap the fumaroles , and inside the sulphur condenses into a molten red liquid , dripping back down and solidifying into pure sulphur			1
' @entity72 hack chunks off with steel bars , braving extremely dangerous gases and liquids with minimal protection , then load up as much as they can carry for the more than three kilometres to the weighing station			0
' loads can weigh up to 90kg , and a single miner might make as many as two or three trips return in a day			0
risky : the miners endanger their lives with the work on the slopes of an active volcano picturesque : but the landscape is less welcoming for the miners who work there every day meeting : miners gather by the weighing station to work out how much they are owed chilling out : a miner enjoys a cigarette as he guards his valuable sulphur - the only way of making a living for some ' the hills they walk through are high and steep , and very difficult terrain			1

it is also used to manufacture paper , paints , plastics , rubber , batteries , explosives and film			0
spectacular : the view over the @entity16 crater , with seams of sulphur on its sides and a lake in the centre industry : @entity34 is valued by manufacturers because of its versatile range of uses machinery : a miner hitches his basket of sulphur to the scales used to weigh the mineral			2
