by @entity0 published : 06:57 est , 8 may 2013 updated : 09:01 est , 9 may 2013 with their massive bodies , huge ears and shaggy coats , they are not so much donkeys as woolly mammoths			1
and farmer @entity7 finds the @entity8 so irresistible that she has built up a herd of 22 , the biggest in the @entity10			1
the donkeys can grow to more than 8ft tall – larger than most horses – and are renowned for their friendly and mischievous personalities			1
enormous : farmer @entity7 , seen with giant donkey @entity14 , has the largest herd of @entity8 donkeys in the @entity10 they date back to medieval times in @entity20 , and were popular working animals until the mid- 20th century , when mechanisation made them obsolete			1
a survey in 1977 found just 44 surviving donkeys , and despite breeding programmes there are still fewer than 1,000 in the world			2
miss @entity7 , 52 , from @entity29 in the @entity30 , has spent nine years building up her herd , seven of which would have gone for slaughter but for her intervention			1
she and her small team of farm hands work round the clock to look after the creatures , dedicating hours to grooming so their coats do not turn into dreadlocks			2
loveable : @entity8 foals @entity44 and @entity45 at the farm in @entity47 , where the farmer made a home for rescued donkeys that had been bound for the abbatoir in @entity20 ms @entity7 , one of only two @entity8 breeders in the @entity10 , said : ' in 2004 i phoned a lady in @entity20 looking to buy a llama , and ended up with two @entity57 donkeys which i instantly fell in love with			1
' i started looking into the breed and found out they were incredibly rare			0
' gradually i built up the herd , and then started rescuing them			1
' i have rescued seven from @entity20 which would have otherwise ended up going to the slaughter house			0
' @entity65 spread i was rescuing them and i have since been approached by a lot of people about taking in their @entity8			2
' the breed were to @entity20 what shire horses are to @entity10 and were exported all over the world , ' ms @entity7 said			1
' then came mechanisation and they fell out of favour			0
' there are still less than 1,000 in the stud book and we have 22 of them , ' she added			0
critically endangered : there now are less than 1,000 @entity57 donkeys like @entity14 in existence @entity85 : ms @entity7 said the donkeys are funny and friendly , but also ' a bit naughty ' the biggest donkey at @entity7 ’s 120 - acre @entity89 is @entity90 , dwarfing standard donkeys at a whopping 16 hands - or 5ft 4ins - measured to its shoulders			1
its huge neck and head add several extra feet to its overall height			0
the largest in the world lives on a farm in @entity101 and stands at 17 hands ( 5ft 7ins )			2
the biggest donkey in the @entity10 is thought to be at a farm in @entity105 , standing at 8ft tall when measured from the ground to the tip of its ears			1
@entity7 added : ' @entity90 is huge and will probably get a bit bigger still			2
at 16 hands she is quite a bit bigger than people like to ride horses			0
' most people tend to ride horses that are 14 or 15 hands			0
' historically they had very poor diets so we actually have to limit what they eat otherwise they will grow too big			0
' i love their temperament , they ’re so funny and friendly , and they teach you patience			0
' they ’re very intelligent and also a bit naughty			0
people often write - off donkeys but i think they are just wonderful			0
