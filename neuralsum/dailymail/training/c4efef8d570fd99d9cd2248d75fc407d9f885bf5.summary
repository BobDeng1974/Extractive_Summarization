by @entity0 no one can accuse them of melting into the crowd			1
with their lurid pink and purple uniforms , the army of @entity6 volunteers will be easy to spot			1
in fact the new outfits are so bright , mayor of london @entity9 apologised for them yesterday			1
@entity15 's next top model ? @entity9 gathered 30 @entity16 together to showcase the new uniform greeting some of the 8,000 ' @entity16 ' , who will guide tourists around the capital , he said : ' what do you think of the uniform ? ' it 's quite striking , is n't it ? i hope you do n't feel too ridiculous			1
we need to overcome our natural @entity15 reserve and be a little bit more like the @entity30 ! ' some observers even described the outfits as looking more like @entity34 sweets from @entity35			1
they consist of a polo shirt with matching fleece , anorak and rucksack as well as a straw trilby with a pink ribbon			1
they are based on the @entity6 2012 logo , which mps described as ' childish ' when it was unveiled five years ago			1
the ensembles are based on on the @entity6 logo , which cost £ 400,000 to design but was lambasted by mps as ' childish ' when it was unveiled in 2007			1
hats off ! the uniform - a loose tracksuit top and matching poloshirt - comes with a beige trilby trimmed with a pink ribbon hogging the limelight : the inspiration could have been a @entity35 @entity34 sweet @entity56 , one of the official @entity6 colours , has been chosen as the ' way - finding ' colour and will also feature on signposts for the games			1
greeting the volunteers at @entity62 in @entity63 , mr @entity9 added : ' i think the uniforms are beautiful			2
i have a rucksack in the same livery but it 's not the same style			2
' whoever designed it needs a prize			2
' asked whether he 'd be wearing his uniform to the games , he added : ' i would n't rule it out			2
i have a fleece already but this could be a good replacement			2
' it 's in extremely good taste and style , and typical of @entity63			2
' the uniforms were received with brave faces from the @entity6 ambassadors , who will be working as volunteers during the games to help visitors navigate @entity63			2
the volunteers will be stationed at key points in the city such as airports and tourist attractions to give directions and advice			0
@entity99 , 29 , a brand manager from @entity63 , said : ' the uniforms are interesting			0
i was a little surprised at first saw them , but at least we 'll stand out			0
i can live with wearing pink and purple for a week			1
' highly visible : 8,000 people have volunteered to be @entity16 , to be stationed at pods across the capital to welcome visitors and direct them around the city - and the @entity6 committee wanted them to be easy to spot @entity111 , 41 , a marketing manager from @entity63 , added : ' this is the first time we 've seen the uniforms , and they 're certainly bright			0
they are quite out there , but we as ambassadors need to be out there so it 's totally the right thing to wear			0
' @entity63 ambassador @entity121 , 65 , said : ‘ i like the trilby hat as it suits both men and women and will be useful to have as we will be outside a lot of the time in the sun. the black bottoms are also practical and sensible			1
i do n’t mind the purple and the pink as you need to be visible and stand out and they ’ve obviously taken some of the logo colours			1
' but while the shirt is fine on the men , it gives a ' big pink bra ' effect on the women , which is n’t particularly flattering and will be more noticeable on ladies with a larger bust			1
' it 's that way ! @entity9 tries out one of the @entity16 ' information pods for size the ambassadors were selected from more than 30,000 applicants and are aged between 14 and 85 , speaking 40 languages between them			0
organisers said they were looking for people with good communication skills as well as knowledge of the city			0
they will volunteer for a maximum of five hours per shift and up to six consecutive days			0
controversial : the @entity158 logo drew criticism for being gaudy and puerile also unveiled yesterday was the design for the @entity6 information kiosks – also in shocking pink - which will be stationed at 43 locations in the city			1
both have been designed by @entity166 , based on guidelines set out by the the @entity168 ( @entity168 )			0
the mixed response echoes the public reaction to the controversial @entity158 logo after it was unveiled in 2007			0
at the time , the @entity172 came under fire for approving the over-the - top design , which drew fierce criticism for being garish and ' childish			0
' contemporary @entity15 designers were near - unanimous in their disapproval of the logo , describing it as ' confusing ' and ' embarrassing '			0
@entity180 , founder of the @entity181 , said it was ' a puerile mess , an artistic flop and a commercial scandal			0
' a two week public exhibition has opened at @entity187 to give a taste of how @entity63 will look and feel during @entity190 time			0
the exhibition will feature examples of the colourful dressing and bunting that will be on display throughout the city , plus a number of examples of how high streets and towns will be getting involved with the celebrations .			0
