by @entity0 published : 07:20 est , 20 september 2012 updated : 16:44 est , 20 september 2012 @entity1 lurched closer to recession yesterday as a dramatic slump in output dented president @entity6 ’s hopes of reviving the flagging economy			2
a report showed @entity1 businesses have suffered their worst month in nearly three - and - a - half years , plunging the eurozone ’s second largest economy into turmoil			2
the decline in @entity1 was echoed across the region and piled pressure on @entity17 leaders to get a grip on the single currency debt crisis			0
problems : economists suggested that the downbeat picture from @entity1 , showed that unemployment running a 13 - year high and a raft of tax rises announced by @entity26 president @entity6 may be weighing on activity @entity28 , a @entity17 economist at the research group @entity29 , said : ‘ there is little here to alter the view that the eurozone recession looks set to deepen in the latter part of the year			1
’ mr @entity6 , a @entity26 , swept to power in may promising to reverse austerity , but his popularity has tumbled as the economy has flatlined			0
the government is due to outline spending cuts and tax rises worth around £ 25billion next week			1
these are likely to include a 75 per cent rate of tax on those earning more than £ 800,000 – a move that threatens to drive many @entity1 wealth creators overseas			2
the measures may not be enough to cut the deficit from 4.5 per cent of gross domestic product this year to 3 per cent next year , forcing mr @entity6 to consider even deeper cuts			2
the closely watched purchasing managers ’ index of activity in @entity1 – where a number below 50 represents decline – fell from 48 in august to a 41 - month low of 44.1 this month			2
it was the seventh month in a row when the number has been below 50 and suggested the @entity1 economy could shrink by 0.6 per cent in the current third quarter of the year			1
that follows nine months of zero growth			0
at the same time , the @entity65 government said yesterday it expected its economy would shrink by 2.4 per cent this year , double its earlier projections			1
shrinking : the data suggested that @entity1 's 2 trillion euro economy , which posted zero growth in the last nine months , could shrink by as much as 0.5 - 0.6 percent in the third quarter , said @entity72 chief economist @entity71 for 2013 , @entity65 now expects its economy to contract by 0.2 per cent , after earlier predictions of 0.5 per cent growth			1
it came against the backdrop of better - than - expected @entity78 figures from @entity79			1
during @entity17 morning trade , the @entity81 declined 0.53 per cent , @entity1 ’s @entity80 slumped 0.51 per cent , while @entity79 ’s @entity83 dropped 0.30 per cent			1
the @entity72 / @entity85 flash composite purchasing manager 's index ( @entity78 ) , a preliminary estimate of firms ' activity that covers both manufacturing and services , slid to 44.1 in september , its lowest level in 41 months , from 48.0 in august			1
it was seventh consecutive month that the composite indicator remained below the 50 - point threshold separating a contraction in activity from expansion			2
' @entity1 is really starting to struggle quite substantially , ' said @entity72 chief economist @entity71			0
' its economy is suffering as its neighbours are seeing demand weaken and ... there are few signs of demand to stimulate growth in @entity1			0
' the data suggested that @entity1 's 2 trillion euro economy , which posted zero growth in the last nine months , could shrink by as much as 0.5 - 0.6 percent in the third quarter , he said			1
september 's gloomy outlook came despite positive news flow on the euro zone crisis , including the announcement of the @entity115 's bond - buying programme that lifted stock markets			1
' it may be too early for the good news to have filtered through , ' @entity71 said			0
' but the fact that businesses grew gloomier is a big concern			0
' business orders , which had slowed the pace of their contraction in recent months , fell at the fastest rate in 3 - 1/2 - years as both weak final demand and uncertainty weighed			1
@entity6 has made reviving @entity1 's stalled economy a priority since he took office in may but his efforts have been hampered by a wave of layoffs from companies including retailer @entity135 ( @entity136 ) and car maker @entity137 ( @entity138 )			0
after 7.2 billion euros in tax rises this year , @entity6 has already indicated he will hike levies on households and businesses by much more in 2013 in an effort to trim @entity1 's public deficit to 3 percent of gdp			1
" it could be that @entity1 - specific factors have played a role , with the upcoming fiscal consolidation of more than 30 billion euros next year likely having made consumers as well as producers reluctant to spend , hitting activity , " said @entity147 economist @entity146			1
high international energy and commodity costs pushed input prices higher , while weak demand meant that output prices continued to fall , forcing companies to accept smaller profit margins			2
" investment will be hurt , as will unemployment			0
companies will be moving further into cost cutting , " @entity71 said			0
layoffs accelerated to the fastest rate in 34 months , with manufacturers and service providers both recording steeper falls in payrolls as work backlogs declined			0
the contraction in activity was most severe in the manufacturing sector , which is more exposed to the weak international outlook			0
activity here fell for the seventh consecutive month , sinking to a 41 - month low of 42.6			0
overall new manufacturing orders fell more sharply than export orders , suggesting that deteriorating domestic demand was mostly to blame			0
household consumption , the motor of @entity1 's economy , is closely linked to unemployment , which is running at more than 10 percent			1
service activity , meanwhile , worsened for a second straight month , sliding to a four - month low of 46.1 , from 49.2 in august			0
service providers ' business expectations , which had improved sharply in august , slid back into negative territory in september for the first time since february 2009			1
the indices for outstanding business and new business in the services sector were also sharply weaker .			0

took a sharp turn for the worse in september , shrinking at its fastest pace since *april* 2009
economists suggested that unemployment running a 13 - year high and a raft of tax rises may be contribute
