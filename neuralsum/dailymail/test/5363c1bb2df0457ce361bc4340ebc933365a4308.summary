neuroscientists have succeeded in creating ' ghosts ' in the laboratory by tricking the brains of test subjects into feeling an unexpected ' presence ' in the room			1
the spooky experiment which conjured up a ghostly illusion in the laboratory has proved once and for all that it 's only our mind playing tricks			1
the invisible , creepy presence reported by so many people over the centuries is just a set of mixed - up signals in the brain , the researchers say			1
' this confirms that it is caused by an altered perception of their own bodies in the brain , ' said professor @entity35 of the @entity36 ( @entity36 ) in @entity37 blindfolded and wearing ear - plugs , test subjects performed movements with their hand attached to a robotic device			1
behind them , the robotic device reproduced their movements and touched them on the back			2
when conducted in real time , the participant 's brain could adapt and recognize it as their own movement because of the synchronized movement			2
however , when the scientists introduced a temporal delay of just a few milliseconds , the distorting of temporal and spatial perception induced the ' ghostly ' feeling			2
the sensation was re-created by researchers using a robot to interfere with the sensory signals in the brains of blindfolded volunteers			1
under normal circumstances the brain is able to form a unified self - perception , but lead researcher @entity35 explained that when this malfunctions the brain creates a second representation of its body			2
' most of the research predicts that we can not tickle ourselves because our brain precisely predicts of one hand , of my hand , touching my body or touching one or another position			2
however , if this is not fully integrated because i 'm doing it or if i can not correctly predict because somebody else were to touch me ; in those cases of uncertainty , very often in those cases of double touch , the response is that you feel ticklish or tickled by somebody else , ' said @entity35 who is leading the research at the @entity36 in @entity91 , @entity37 ( @entity36 )			1
the findings appear to explain the common experience people have of feeling an unseen presence , even a guardian angel , demon or apparition stalking their movements			0
these are frequently reported by people in extreme physical or emotional situations , such as mountaineers and explorers , or those grieving for a lost loved one			0
they are also associated with medical conditions that affect the brain , including epilepsy , migraine , schizophrenia and cancer			0
@entity35 's team began by analyzing the brains of 12 patients with neurological disorders who have reported having such a secondary representation of their body , in other words a ghost sensation			1
mri scans revealed abnormalities with three brain regions involved in self - awareness , movement and the sense of position in space			0
these brain regions together contribute to multi sensory signal processing , important for the perception of one 's own body			1
the scientists then conducted an experiment to ' trigger ' a similar neurological sensation in healthy subjects			1
blindfolded and wearing ear - plugs , test subjects performed movements with their hand attached to a robotic device			1
behind them , the robotic device reproduced their movements and touched them on the back			0
when conducted in real time , the participant 's brain could adapt and recognize it as their own movement because of the synchronized movement			0
however , when the scientists introduced a temporal delay of just a few milliseconds , the distorting of temporal and spatial perception induced the ' ghostly ' feeling			0
' we built a robot which allows us to distort this signal , which makes it hard - or impossible actually - our robot makes it impossible for our healthy subjects now to predict those signals			1
artificial ' ghosts ' have been conjured up by scientists in an experiment so spooky that two participants asked for it to stop			1
by having signals mixed up in their brains ( shown ) , volunteers were made to feel that a creepy ' presence ' was behind them			1
they counted up to four phantoms positioned where no - one was standing ' and one side effect of this was , instead of saying that i 'm touching myself or that i 'm touching with my index finger my own body ; subjects reported in those scenarios where we distorted the signal that somebody else was touching them			0
' and this somebody else ; actually some subjects reacted very strongly and they reported that not only that somebody else was touching them , but somebody else was also present			0
' so strong , that some of them decided not to finish the experiment , ' said @entity35			1
the robot creates a disconnect between the movements subjects make and the sensations they were expecting , mixing up ' sensorimotor ' brain signals of individuals so that their brains no longer recognized input signals as belonging to their own body			1
@entity35 said the system mimics the sensations of some patients with mental disorders or of healthy individuals under extreme circumstances			0
the study , published in @entity214 , said that ' simple sensorimotor conflicts induced , in healthy subjects , an experience that shares crucial aspects with positive , first - rank symptoms in schizophrenia '			0
@entity35 says the main aim of the study is to better understand some of the symptoms of neurological or psychiatric conditions , such as schizophrenia			0
he hopes the research could lead to a similar robotic system that does n't induce neurological symptoms , but helps patients overcome such sensations			0
' we are very interested in pursuing this line of work to build similar robotic devices based on our prototype that do not induce psychotic symptoms in healthy subjects but a similar robot that could be used to down regulate psychotic symptoms in actual patients			1
' here an unamed participant takes part in the experiment			2
the robot made humans feel the illusory presence of a non-existent ' ghost '			2
the study was conducted on 12 individuals with various neurological conditions such as epilepsy , stroke , migraine and tumours such therapies , he says , could include a wearable device that would help neurological patients down - regulate - or reduce - these feelings ; in effect a device to reverse the sensations they created in the lab. ' a more future version we are still working on at the moment could be a completely wearable set - up of the device that you have seen			0
so this is something that the patient will have maybe inserted in his clothes ; smart textiles in a way			0
and should there be strong manifestations in this case , one could provide feedback in a way that is now not optimized to induce such a psychotic state but to dis - regulate or to down - regulate such a state			0
' two of the 12 healthy participants were so disturbed by the experience that they asked the scientists to halt the experiment , the results of which appear in the journal @entity214 .			2
