by @entity0 published : 02:02 est , 10 september 2013 updated : 02:05 est , 10 september 2013 from @entity6 's purple - only eating plan to @entity4 's maple syrup cleanse , bizarre celebrity menus are a regular cause of controversy			0
but while @entity14 's food crazes are usually assumed to be a modern phenomenon , the january 1929 issue of @entity11 magazine @entity10 , unearthed by @entity12 , proves that there 's nothing new about fad diets			1
in an article entitled @entity21 , writer @entity19 explains why eating like @entity22 and other period stars could prove problematic			0
on @entity14 's unappetising menu is a breakfast of hot water ( 0 calories ) and eight tablespoons of consomme actress @entity22 looking svelte for the 1955 film @entity29 ' @entity21 ! , ' @entity30 writes			2
' it has put one world famous star in her grave , has caused the illness of many others , has wrecked careers and has become , largely through its practice in @entity14 , the @entity40 ! ' @entity30 then goes on to compare the ' star diet ' to a correct diet compiled by one dr willis ' from works of the most famous authorities on diet '			1
on @entity14 's unappetising menu is a breakfast of hot water ( 000 calories , says dr @entity50 ) and eight tablespoons of consomme [ clear soup ] , two saltine crackers and a quarter of a pound of tomatoes for lunch - total calorific intake , a meagre 138			1
for supper , the 1929 a-list diet consists of cottage cheese , two ounces of pineapple and a glass of buttermilk , which together bring the total day 's calories to a skinny 305			2
by contrast , the diet recommended by @entity50 , which , he says , will have you dropping between two and three pounds per week , includes roast beef lunches and a breakfast of scalloped cod and stewed tomatoes			1
@entity30 alleges that actress @entity72 ' took 10 pounds off ' with a ' spinach and egg ' diet the writer blames @entity14 's diet demands for the death of actress @entity79 , who died aged 29 breakfast : cup of hot water ( calories - 0 ) luncheon : 8 tablespoons of consomme ( @entity86 ) two saltine crackers ( @entity88 ) 1/4lb tomatoes ( @entity90 ) dinner : cottage cheese ( @entity93 ) 2oz pineapple ( @entity93 ) 1 glass buttermilk ( @entity96 ) total : 305 * do n't try this at home @entity30 goes on to fulminate against ' @entity100 ' producers who when they demand a pound of flesh from their actresses , also ' demand a part of the lifespan of the star '			1
what 's more she adds , the @entity14 diet craze is responsible for increasing numbers of tuberculosis cases and will ' produce a race of anaemic tubercular weaklings ' if allowed to continue			2
she also blames @entity14 's diet demands for the death of actress @entity79 , who died aged 29 of tuberculosis in 1926			1
another anecdote concerns @entity22 , who , the writer claims , she saw having a lunch composed of just ' a few tablespoonfuls of cold consomme , a dish of rhubarb and half a dozen crackers thickly spread with mustard			0
' @entity30 also alleges that actress @entity72 ' took 10 pounds off ' with a ' spinach and egg ' diet , comprised of six ounces of spinach and a hardboiled egg for breakfast , lunch and supper			0
interestingly , another part of the article deals with camera trickery - blamed for promoting an unrealistic image long before @entity138 was invented			0
' a skillful cameraman may arrange his lights so this condition is helped , ' she complains			0
she even writes of a primitive version of liposuction undergone by actress @entity145 , who , says @entity30 , ' suffered acutely ' in the aftermath of the operation			0
@entity14 and its madcap diet crazes might appear to be a chilling modern phenomenon , but as @entity30 's article shows , celebrity diets have a long and inglorious history			2
the diet recommended to have you dropping two to three pounds per week , includes roast beef breakfast - 374 calories 1/2 large grapefruit , scalloped codfish , stewed tomatoes , saltine crackers , one cup of coffee , one teaspoon of butter , one teaspoon of sugar luncheon - 654 calories two large slices of lean roast beef , tomato or mushroom sauce , one medium baked potato , two heaped tablespoons of spinach , two heaped tablespoons of pickled beets , eight slices of cucumber , one glass of buttermilk , one teaspoon of butter , one fruit cup dinner - 524 calories one slice of cold roast lamb , two heaped tablespoons of squash , mint sauce , one tablespoon of green peas , three heaped tablespoons of mustard greens , medium - sized tomato salad , mineral oil or vinegar , two biscuits [ savoury scones ] , half a canteloupe melon , one glass of skimmed milk total : 1552 calories			0
