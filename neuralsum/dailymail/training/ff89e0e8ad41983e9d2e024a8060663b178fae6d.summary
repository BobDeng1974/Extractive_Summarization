it was a mission that captivated audiences across the world - and now video reveals exactly what astronauts will experience when they come back to @entity6 in the @entity8 capsule			1
among the first data to be removed from @entity8 following its uncrewed dec. 5 flight test was video recorded through windows in @entity8 ’s crew module			0
@entity14 says it ' provides a taste of the intense conditions the spacecraft and the astronauts it carries will endure when they return from deep space destinations on the journey to @entity21			1
the spacecraft hit speeds of 20,000 mph ( 32,000 kph ) and weathered temperatures approaching 4,000 degrees fahrenheit as it entered @entity6 's atmosphere			1
although much of the video was transmitted down to @entity6 and shown in real time on @entity42 , it was not available in its entirety			0
the blackout caused by the superheated plasma surrounding the vehicle as it endured the peak temperatures of its descent prevented downlink of any information at that key point			0
however , the cameras were able to record the view and now the public can have an up - close look at the extreme environment a spacecraft experiences as it travels back through @entity6 's environment from beyond low - earth orbit			1
the video begins 10 minutes before @entity8 's 11:29 a.m. est splashdown in the @entity63 , just as the spacecraft was beginning to experience @entity6 's atmosphere			2
peak heating from the friction caused by the atmosphere rubbing against @entity8 's heat shield comes less than two minutes later , and the footage shows the plasma created by the interaction change from white to yellow to lavender to magenta as the temperature increases			2
as @entity8 emerges safely on the other side of its trial by fire , the camera continues to record the deployment of the series of parachutes that slowed it to a safe 20 mph for landing and the final splash as @entity8 touched down on @entity6			2
@entity8 was then retrieved by a combined @entity42 , @entity85 and @entity86 team and carried back to shore aboard the @entity85 's @entity89			1
after returning to shore , it was loaded on to a truck and driven back to @entity42 's @entity92 in @entity93 , where it arrived on thursday			1
the video begins 10 minutes before @entity8 's 11:29 a.m. est splashdown in the @entity63 , just as the spacecraft was beginning to experience @entity6 's atmosphere			2
@entity8 traveled 3,600 miles above @entity6 on its 4.5 - hour flight test – farther than any spacecraft built for humans has been in more than 40 years			1
in coming back from that distance , it also traveled faster and experienced hotter temperatures – 20,000 mph and near 4,000 degrees @entity101 , to be exact			1
after the fiery re-entry , the craft slows as it enters @entity6 's atmosphere , revealing the bright blue sky above it			0
@entity8 will travel faster and experience even higher temperatures on future missions , when it returns from greater distances , but this altitude allowed engineers to perform a good checkout of @entity8 's critical systems – in particular its heat shield			2
@entity8 's flight test was a critical step on @entity42 's journey to @entity21			1
work already has begun on the next @entity8 capsule , which will launch for the first time on top of @entity42 's new @entity122 rocket and travel to a distant retrograde orbit around the moon			1
three minutes from landing , the main parachutes open to bring the capsule back to @entity6			0
a combined @entity85 and @entity14 team successfully towed the spacecraft out of the water after a flawless launch and landing			1
the successful retrieval of @entity134 1 ( @entity134 - 1 ) was part of a @entity137 government inter-agency effort to test recovery techniques for future space flights			0
but although this was @entity8 ’s first trip to space , it is actually the fifth at - sea testing of a module using the @entity85 well deck recovery method - although the others had used mock - ups			1
four tests were conducted prior to the flight to prepare the recovery team and make sure everything went smoothly			0
the first test was conducted at @entity154 , @entity155 in august 2013			0
the others were conducted earlier in 2014 , known as @entity157 ( @entity158 )			0
if astronauts had been onboard @entity8 , they would have experienced a g - force of 8.2 - nearly twice that generated when @entity162 capsules return from the @entity163			2
@entity8 hit its target point 275 miles ( 442 km ) west of @entity165 , @entity165 , and achieved at least one record : flying farther and faster than any capsule built for humans since the @entity169			1
' there 's your new spacecraft , @entity175 , ' @entity171 commentator @entity170 said as the @entity8 capsule neared the water			1
he called the journey ' the most perfect flight you could ever imagine			0
' the capsule reached a peak altitude more than 14 times farther from @entity6 than the @entity163			0
no spacecraft designed for astronauts had gone so far since @entity185 , 42 years ago			2
splashdown ! a combined @entity85 and @entity14 team successfully towed the spacecraft out of the water after a flawless launch and landing			1
@entity42 's @entity8 spacecraft is off loaded from the back of the @entity89 at @entity194 , @entity165 divers surround the capsule ( in green helmets ) as the operation begins to recover @entity8 the @entity89 was ultimately chosen for @entity134 - 1 as it has a combination of capabilities suited to assist @entity14 with the @entity8 recovery			1
called a landing platform dock ( @entity204 ) ship , it has a well - deck , advanced medical facilities , helicopters , three dimensional air - search radar and small boats that could all be used in the recovery operation			2
a specially - trained bridge team were also used throughout the duration of the recovery			0
and once the capsule had landed in the @entity63 , off the coast of @entity165 , the ship manoeuvred close to it along with small boats in order to safely retrieve it			2
recovery team members in a @entity218 boat help guide @entity14 's @entity8 spacecraft into the well deck of the @entity89 following its splashdown in the @entity63 divers attached lines from the small boats to guide the capsule toward @entity89 , where a @entity14 - designed winch hauled the capsule into the well deck			1
‘ @entity8 is meant to be reused , which is why we tailored this recovery to accommodate keeping the capsule safe , ’ said @entity227 of @entity228 11			0
and chief boatswain ’s mate @entity232 , deck department leading chief petty officer , added : ' we practiced this recovery many times with safety as the number one priority			0
the sailors were focused and completed the mission at hand successfully			0
' i could n't be more proud of our sailors and the work they accomplished here today			0
’ in 11 minutes , @entity8 slowed from to 20 mph ( 32kph ) at splashdown - its final descent aided by eight parachutes deployed in sequence on target : @entity8 splashed down at its target point 275 miles ( 442 km ) west of @entity165 , @entity165 while travelling at around 20mph ( 32km/h ) on friday @entity14 's new @entity8 spacecraft made the ' bull 's - eye ' splashdown in the @entity63 following its dramatic test flight that took it twice around @entity6 in 4.5 hours			1
the spacecraft , which could someday take humans to @entity21 , made a fiery 20,000 mph ( 32,000 kph ) re-entry into the planet enduring temperatures of 2,200 ° @entity260 )			1
cameras fitted to the rocket and capsule captured the entire mission - giving an unprecedented ' @entity8 's - eye ' view from inside the capsule that could on day take man to @entity21			1
looking home : cameras onboard the @entity8 capsule took this stunning snap of the @entity6 during re-entry			2
flames show the incredible heat the capsule was subjected to , as it hit speeds of 20,000 mph and weathered temperatures approaching @entity28 ( 4,000 ° f ) cameras onboard @entity8 captured its entire mission , from blast off ( left ) to its climb into orbit ( right ) an astronaut 's eye view : a camera mounted insde the capsule looking out a windows captured this stunning image of @entity6 @entity14 needed to send @entity8 that high in order to set the crew module up for a rapid and fiery entry			1
that was considered the most critical part of the entire flight - testing the largest of its kind heat shield for survival before humans climb aboard			0
in 11 minutes , @entity8 slowed from to 20 mph ( 32km/h ) at splashdown - its final descent aided by eight parachutes deployed in sequence			0
@entity6 shrank from view through @entity8 's capsule window during its trip out to space , and stunning images were relayed back home			1
its return was recorded by an unmanned drone flying over the recovery zone , providing more spectacular views			0
helicopters then relayed images of the crew module bobbing in the water			0
three of the five air bags deployed properly , enough to keep the capsule floating upright			0
' today 's flight test of @entity8 is a huge step for @entity42 and a really critical part of our work to pioneer deep space on our journey to @entity21 , ' said @entity14 administrator @entity325 on friday			1
' the teams did a tremendous job putting @entity8 through its paces in the real environment it will endure as we push the boundary of human exploration in the coming years			0
' after being offloaded at shore the capsule will make the journey back to @entity92 from @entity336 on the back of a truck - and officials said they hoped it would arrive by @entity341			1
@entity8 is being developed alongside the world 's most powerful rocket , the @entity122 ( @entity122 ) , which is due to make its maiden launch in 2018 or 2019			0
together , @entity122 and @entity8 will allow @entity14 to send humans into deep space to destinations such as @entity21			2
there were a number of key moments throughout the flight ( shown in diagram ) , designed to test the capability of @entity8 , all of which it passed without a hitch			0
in total the flight lasted about four and a half hours first step towards @entity21 : @entity8 's @entity361 rocket clears the service tower that sits alongside the launchpad at @entity364			2
the high - stakes test flight is meant to usher in a new era of human exploration leading ultimately to @entity21			0

@entity369 was first item to be recovered tfrom the @entity8 capsule as it arrived back and its @entity93 launch @entity372 series of images have revealed how a combined @entity85 and @entity14 team recovered the @entity8 spacecraft
the future @entity21 - bound vehicle splashed down at a target point 275 miles ( 442km ) west of @entity165
divers and a fleet of boats were used to tow @entity8 back to the well deck of the @entity89
the ship is now making its way to shore and will offload @entity8 in @entity336 later today
@entity8 launched at 12.05 *gmt* ( *07.05* et ) on 5 dec , making a 4.5 hour - journey that saw it orbit earth twice
it then *re-entered* the atmosphere at 20,000 mph ( 32,000 kph ) enduring temperatures of @entity28 ( 4,000 ° f )
@entity14 's @entity8 spacecraft is designed to carry astronauts to an asteroid and eventually to @entity21 in the 2030s
