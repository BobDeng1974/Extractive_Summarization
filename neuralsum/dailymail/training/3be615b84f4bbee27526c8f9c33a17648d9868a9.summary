blue light - emitting diodes have been receiving positive attention after its inventors were awarded the @entity4 in physics last week			0
they use around 90 per cent less energy than incandescent bulbs and last for 100,000 hours compared with 1,000 hours for tungsten filament light bulbs			1
but while they may be good for the environment , a new study claims that the discovery may a problem for insects , which are more strongly attracted to the led spectrum of light			1
sodium vapour bulbs , which emit yellow light , are commonly used in street lighting as they are more efficient than @entity37 lights			1
insects are attracted to both white and yellow light , but it seems they are even more attracted to blue light which is generated by @entity1 bulbs			1
overall , the researchers caught and labelled more than 20,000 insects , with moths and flies the most common group of bugs			1
they claim the attraction can be fatal , causing flies to be thrown off their usual path and into the jaws of predators , disrupting the food chain			1
three @entity55 - born scientists have won the @entity4 in physics for inventing blue - light emitting diodes ( leds ) that have revolutionised the lighting industry			2
@entity60 and @entity61 of @entity55 and @entity63 scientist @entity62 won the award for their 1990s invention , which has led to the use of environmentally - friendly light sources worldwide			2
but when @entity62 invented the technology in 1993 , the company he worked for at the time awarded him the equivalent of just £ 125 ( $ 200 ) - despite the idea being worth a potential £ 50 billion ( $ 80 billion ) by 2020 according to estimates			0
@entity62 invented the blue light - emitting - diode while working for the @entity75 in @entity76 , @entity55 in 1993			0
but when he first came up with @entity75 rewarded him with just 20,000 yen ( £ 125 or $ 200 ) , as @entity55 firms favoured the mentality that work for an employer was not a means for personal glory			0
however @entity62 quit and moved to the @entity63 in 2000 , before counter-suing in 2001 after @entity75 attempted to sue him for infringing trade secrets			0
he was ultimately awarded £ 5.04 million ( $ 8.1 million ) for the idea , reported as the largest payout ever made to an employee for an invention			0
@entity62 ( left ) , @entity60 ( centre ) and @entity61 ( right ) , all born in @entity55 , have won the 2014 @entity89 , for their environmentally - friendly blue leds			0
the lighting breakthrough creates more energy - efficient home lighting , and can improve keyhole surgery techniques another concern is that @entity1 lights near ports could attract flying pests , such as the gypsy moth , that are accidentally transported by ships			1
' the behavior of many animals is influenced by light in the blue portion of the spectrum			2
for example , insects have specific photoreceptors for blue light , ' @entity105 , an entomologist at the @entity26 research institute @entity25 , told @entity110			2
' thus large - scale adoption of ' white ' lighting is likely to increase the impacts of nighttime lighting on all species sensitive to ' blue ' light			0
the tests showed that simply changing the spectrum of @entity1 did not reduce their attractiveness to insects			1
the use of led lighting is set to increase			0
estimates suggest the technology , used in everything from homes to billboards today , will be worth £ 50 billion ( $ 80 billion ) in 2020			0
the research , by @entity26 - based institute @entity25 , found traps placed near leds captured 48 per cent more insects than traps near sodium - vapour lights a major concern is that @entity1 lights near ports could attract flying pests , such as the gypsy moth ( pictured ) , that are accidentally transported by ships			1

led bulbs use around 90 per cent less energy than incandescent lights
but insects are more strongly attracted to the led spectrum of light
scientists caught and labelled around 20,000 insects attracted to @entity1
the attraction can be fatal , causing more flies to be eaten by predators
scientists say this can disrupt food chains and *damage* local *ecosystems*
another concern is that @entity1 lights near ports could attract flying pests , such as the gypsy moth , that are accidentally transported by ships
