@entity0 fired another shot in his verbal battle with @entity3 on friday when he hit back over the wicketkeeper ’s claim that the @entity7 dressing room will be a better place without him			1
prior , whose relationship with @entity0 deteriorated badly towards the end of the @entity12 , became the first player to publicly express his feelings over the maverick ’s sacking when he spoke at a question - and - answer session in @entity18 about the need to ‘ rediscover the honour and pride of playing for @entity7 ’			1
hitting back : @entity0 told @entity3 to spend more time in the nets and less doing ' q&as ' bitter tweet : @entity0 had some advice for @entity3 and taunted him by naming his possible successor out of favour : @entity0 was axed by @entity7 after the ill - fated @entity12 tour @entity29 a better place : prior says the @entity7 dressing room will benefit from not having @entity0 in it @entity33 : prior says @entity0 could have been ' the best @entity7 player to ever walk this planet ' @entity0 responded on @entity35 when he referred to @entity3 as the ‘ @entity36 ’ , a nickname given to him in his early days at @entity38 , and mocked the @entity12 vice-captain ’s demotion from the team for the last two tests in @entity43			1
‘ fewer q&as , more @entity38 nets methinks , ’ said @entity0 , who had earlier revealed details of @entity3 ’s leading role in a team meeting after the @entity47 through his mouthpiece @entity49			1
then @entity0 , who name - checked @entity52 , @entity3 ’s rival for a @entity47 place this summer , responded to a follower ’s tweet which said , ‘ this is why @entity0 is n’t in the @entity7 team any more ’ , by saying , ‘ neither is the @entity58 ’			1
it is a tiresome extension of a row that does little credit to anyone but it is further evidence @entity0 will be lurking in the background to provide a distraction to @entity7 ’s attempts to move on without him			2
re-integrated : prior was instrumental in getting @entity0 back in the @entity7 team following the ' textgate ' scandal - revealed by @entity68 - in 2012 happier times : @entity0 and @entity3 celebrate retaining the ashes in @entity71 in 2010 the @entity52 can do it : @entity0 referenced @entity52 in his tweet to prior - the @entity75 keeper is one of the contenders for the gloves this summer that new era continued without @entity0 here with a slightly shambolic start to the first of three one - day internationals when @entity83 was promoted from his role as temporary coach to be 12th man			1
@entity7 had been hit by injuries to @entity88 and @entity89 , bringing one - day international debuts for @entity91 and @entity92 and also the need for an extra substitute to complete the complement of four demanded by the @entity96			2
@entity83 , who retired from international cricket three years ago , is still active with @entity98 and was considered a better bet than fast bowlers @entity103 and @entity105 should a second sub , in addition to @entity102 , have been required			0
yet the @entity96 , never short of a petty rule , would not let him take the field wearing another player ’s shirt so @entity110 , the @entity7 operations manager , was deputed to head into the stands to borrow one from a fan , @entity114 from @entity115			2
@entity114 was wearing the shirt , a @entity117 present from his wife , for the first time but said he was happy to help out @entity7 while @entity110 promised he would get it signed by the team once @entity122 had finished with it			2
back on the pitch , where @entity122 was not required , there was early encouragement for an @entity7 side who are using this series to prepare for the @entity130 in @entity131			0
the low , slow pitch at a stadium where an unfit outfield forced the abandonment of a @entity136 in 2009 encouraged stand - in captain @entity137 to use three off - spinners in the first 15 overs of the @entity142 innings			0
replacing @entity143 , who was sitting in the stands in his new role as a @entity147 radio summariser and calling @entity0 ’s response to prior ‘ fairly childish ’ , is arguably @entity7 ’s most pressing @entity149 gave the new ball to @entity151 after @entity7 had won the toss and he took the first @entity154 wicket , thanks to a stunning , one - handed catch from @entity158 - born @entity157			1
there was a tidy contribution from @entity161 , who conceded only 23 runs from his 10 overs , and an encouraging start from @entity91 , principally a batsman with @entity166 but clearly no mean spinner , too			0
@entity91 trapped @entity168 lbw and held the catch in an improved @entity7 fielding performance which ended the resistance of @entity171 , who initially held a stuttering @entity142 together with 65			0
yet @entity137 ’s faith in spin backfired when he gave @entity151 the 47th over and saw it go for 23 as @entity176 and @entity177 gave the home side late impetus with some spectacular hitting to take them to a competitive 269 for six			0
the last 10 overs brought 116			0
that gave @entity7 food for thought during an interval when the @entity187 government honoured the island ’s glorious cricketing past by knighting @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192 .			0

@entity0 tells @entity3 ' fewer q&as , more @entity38 nets methinks '
he then taunts ' the @entity36 ' with responses to @entity35 followers
prior said the @entity7 dressing room would be a better place without @entity0
@entity203 ' only want *people* in @entity7 dressing room who are *passionate* '
prior was instrumental to @entity0 *'s* *'re* - integration ' after 2012 text scandal
