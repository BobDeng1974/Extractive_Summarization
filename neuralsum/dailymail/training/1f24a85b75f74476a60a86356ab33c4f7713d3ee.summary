after crashing out of the @entity1 and then losing 3 - 0 at arch - rivals @entity2 , it 's been a week to forget for @entity3			1
the @entity5 ' last two matches have been a microcosm of their season so far			1
after playing a brand of swashbuckling football that saw them close to winning the title last season , @entity9 ' side now look devoid of ideas and lacking in a killer instinct up front			1
@entity19 's @entity18 assesses where ( and why ) things have gone so wrong at @entity22 this campaign			0
what is the minimum @entity3 must achieve this season ? the expectation from @entity28 back in the summer was to retain their place in the top four and secure another adventure in the @entity1			1
no matter how bad the team 's form has been , there will not be reassessing of goals from @entity28			0
they have to get back in the @entity1 and whether they do it by finishing in the top four - or winning the @entity40 - is immaterial			1
@entity9 cut a forlorn figure as his @entity3 side dropped to 10th in the @entity43 on sunday @entity9 says his players are honest , and will keep working hard to get results as the season goes on 2			1
will they take the @entity40 seriously ? and can they realistic compete on two fronts ( thursdays and sundays ) ? for reasons outlined above , they can not doing anything other than take it seriously			0
it might actually be their best chance of qualifying for the @entity1 , plus winning a @entity57 trophy would be a positive for their reputation			1
they have the numbers to compete with a thursday - sunday schedule but whether they have the quality is another matter entirely			2
@entity3 will have to juggle playing on thursdays and sundays after they dropped into the @entity40 the @entity5 were knocked out of the @entity1 after drawing 1 - 1 at home to @entity66 3			1
who had final say on signing the players @entity3 bought in the summer ? the manager			2
for all the talk of the transfer committee , the policy @entity3 follow and their preference for buying young , unproven talent , the buck always stops with @entity9			1
he might have different ideas sometimes to those on the committee on certain players - the other members are @entity82 ( head of analysis ) , @entity85 ( head of scouting ) , @entity88 ( chief scout ) , @entity89 ( chief executive ) and @entity90 ( @entity28 board member )			0
but he does n't have players imposed on him			0
this is what he said on may 28 earlier this year			0
' we will never bring in a player here who the manager does n’t want in			0
that ’s a great credit to the owners and the other people at the club			0
we work very closely together – it ’s worth stressing that			0
it ’s key that we are very much one club			0
' summer signing @entity106 ( far right ) was sent off in @entity3 's draw against @entity66 4			1
why does @entity9 think @entity108 can play centre forward ? @entity108 has speed and scored 10 goals last season			1
he was also prolific during his time as an academy player and on the opening day of the season , he actually combined well against @entity117 , scoring the opening goal of the campaign from a central position			0
on that day , remember , it was being said that he and @entity122 could form a new ' @entity124 ' partnership			0
@entity108 had a bad day in front of goal against @entity2			2
if had taken his opportunities - which he should have done - @entity9 decision to deploy him in that role would have been vindicated			1
winger @entity108 ( left ) started @entity3 's 3 - 0 defeat at @entity2 up front @entity133 ( left ) and @entity108 cut dejected figures as prepare to kick - off after conceding at @entity135 5			1
how embarrassing are the purchases of @entity133 and @entity137 ? nobody was saying @entity137 was an embarrassing purchase in july when he arrived for £ 20m but his start has been a calamity			0
he looks an accident waiting to happen every time he goes on the pitch and @entity9 ' assertion that @entity137 was the natural replacement for @entity148 looks hopelessly misguided at present			1
as for @entity133 , @entity3 actually improved when he came on at @entity135 but what you see with him is what you get			1
he is n't a 20 goal - a - season man , he is n't someone who will set the tone with relentless working and he is always liable to command a negative headline			2
the experiment needs to be ended sooner rather than later but which club would take him ? @entity137 ( left ) and @entity133 have both disappointed since joining @entity3 this summer @entity133 ( right ) came on as a second half substitute but failed to find the net again in the league for the @entity5 6			1
which players do @entity163 need to buy in january ? they need a goalkeeper , a top - class central midfielder and a striker			2
in an ideal world , @entity168 would be the keeper but @entity170 are reluctant to do business with @entity3 any longer in the transfer market			2
he is also 32 , which would be a negative in terms of his possible recruitment			0
@entity3 have a striker , @entity177 , on loan at @entity179 but there is little chance of him arriving at @entity22 next month			2
it would also be unfair to expect an untried 19 - year - old ( who is currently struggling himself in @entity185 ) to transform the season			2
@entity170 keeper @entity168 would be an ideal signing for @entity3 but the @entity188 are reluctant to sell to @entity22 7			2
are funds available … and will @entity9 be trusted to spend it ? there is n't a great deal of money available but they could be creative by raising funds by , say , selling @entity196			2
a more pertinent question is , which players would want to come in january with @entity3 's form being so wretched ? @entity196 ( left ) could be sold in january to help raise funds for the club 's other transfer targets 8			1
how bad are the dressing room issues ? @entity3 have just been knocked out of the @entity1 , they have no chance of winning the @entity43 and their form has been awful - no dressing room in the world would be happy given those circumstances			1
there has been huge change in recent months in terms of personnel and the spirit of last season has not yet been recreated			0
perhaps they need a night out to clear their heads but , at the minute , there is no opportunity in the calendar			0
the amount of games they are playing is relentless			0
@entity3 will look to captain @entity224 to turnaround a fractured dressing room 9			2
will @entity224 stay ? still too early to answer that question			0
@entity224 will make his decision in his own time			0
if he stays at @entity3 , it will because he believes he can still contribute next season			1
the @entity3 captain ( right ) contract at the club runs out this summer and has n't put penned a new one yet 10			1
is @entity237 ’s trigger finger twitching ? @entity237 remains the most well known of @entity3 's owners but he is not as hands on as he used to be			0
he has only tweeted twice about football matters since march 30 - once was to commend a victory over @entity242 , the other was a picture of @entity3 fans in @entity246 on july 23 - and the key @entity28 figures are @entity248 , @entity3 's chairman , and the influential @entity90 , who is most involved in day - to - day business			1
@entity28 have faith in @entity9 and they will back him because he is their man			0
they are an organisation , though , that will not shirk away from making decisions and @entity9 knows he must turn things around			0
patience is not limitless when results are bad and money is at stake			0
@entity9 still has the full support of @entity3 's owners including @entity237 ( centre )			1

@entity3 lost 3 - 0 at *bitter* rivals @entity2 on sunday
@entity5 ' @entity135 defeat leaves them 10th on *21* points after 16 games
@entity3 crashed out of the @entity1 group stages to @entity66
the club have to finish in the @entity43 top four this season
read : @entity9 is under *pressure* , says @entity148
