by @entity0 published : 16:39 est , 27 october 2012 updated : 14:08 est , 29 october 2012 there ca n’t be many one - bedroom terrace houses in @entity3 with a price tag of nearly £ 400,000			1
but then again , there ca n’t be many with a view as spectacular as the one from 1 the @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9			1
the house overlooks @entity11 , one of the most magnificent stretches of coastline in the @entity15			1
besides its stunning vista , the house has the distinction of playing a role in the effort to defeat @entity21 during the @entity22			2
the terrace dates from the @entity24 and was one of scores of dwellings in the area commandeered by the @entity29 in 1943 to house @entity31 troops training for the d - day landings			1
stunning : the one - bedroom home has a priceless view - or at least one worth £ 400,000 @entity34 in @entity11 was considered the perfect place for @entity31 military chiefs to train their men for the @entity39 invasion because of its similarity to the layout of @entity42 , one of the six landing points for @entity46 troops			1
the @entity31 based 15,000 soldiers around the bay			0
while the vista from the house remains as breathtaking as it would have been in the @entity52 , the interior of 1 @entity7 is now strikingly modern			0
however , when the current owner , optician @entity54 , bought the property in 2007 , he says it looked as if it had n’t been updated since it was occupied by @entity31 gis			1
the upstairs was divided into two small bedrooms and the downstairs space included an old - fashioned kitchen - diner and cramped lounge			1
@entity54 set about converting the house into a ultra-modern living space			0
upstairs there is now one large bedroom and state - of - the - art bathroom with underfloor heating , and an open - plan kitchen and lounge below			1
to cut running costs , @entity54 , 48 , fitted an air - source heat pump , a system that absorbs heat from outside in summer and releases it inside in winter			1
prime position : the home , far right , overlooks @entity11 in @entity9 outside , there is a balcony and a dining terrace – the perfect setting for summer suppers overlooking the sea			1
the property shares a large garden stretching down to the beach with the other houses in the terrace			2
@entity54 says : ‘ about the only thing i did n’t change was the large window in the living area downstairs			0
i suppose people appreciate a good view whatever era they live in			0
' it ’s beautiful here on a sunny day but also spectacular when it ’s stormy			0
there ’s a lighthouse at one end of the bay , and when that springs into action it ’s quite a dramatic sight			0
’ according to @entity103 , of selling agents the @entity105 , the vista adds a substantial premium to the home ’s value			0
‘ the view is rare even in this area , ’ she says			0
‘ many properties may boast coastal views but they are often just glimpses from one or two points , while 1 @entity7 has an unrestricted panorama from its rooms and the garden			0
' a view this good can add up to 100 per cent to the property ’s value			2
’ @entity54 – who lives with his wife clair in @entity124 , @entity9 , an hour ’s drive from @entity8 – bought the house as a romantic retreat			1
but having found they are unable to use it as much as they would like , the couple are selling and looking for a second property closer to home			2
for the past two years @entity54 has rented it out as a holiday home for £ 700 a week in high season and £ 410 a week in low season			0
last year it yielded £ 14,000 , and he sees it as a viable proposition for a buyer looking for a property to let for about 22 weeks of the year but which they might use themselves in rental ‘ windows ’			2
while the resort of @entity148 at the other end of @entity11 is deserted in the winter , @entity8 remains fairly busy despite the rising number of wealthy second - homers attracted to this part of @entity9			1
there ’s a restaurant , a post office and pub in the village open all year round			0
celebrity chef @entity159 , who appeared in i ’m a celebrity			0
@entity161 in 2007 , lives in @entity8 , but visitors to the area may well be more interested in the exploits and endea - vours of the @entity31 troops based there in the run - up to @entity167			2
in april 1944 , during a night - time rehearsal for d - day , @entity169 e-boats torpedoed @entity31 landing craft in @entity11 , killing 750 troops – more casualties than were actually lost two months later at @entity42			1
on the beach at @entity148 is a @entity176 tank , salvaged from the sea as a memorial			0
