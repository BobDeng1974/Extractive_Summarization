' he explained that he had intended to see his 77 - year - old mother to show her some photographs of his son acting in a play for which he had won an award			1
when he went to the cottage , he believed that she was asleep so he rang the phone so as not to give her a fright			2

brutal murder : a man tortured the frail pensioner for her credit card pin number before bludgeoning her to death in a frenzied attack at her cottage ( pictured ) @entity117 , prosecuting , told the jury yesterday : ' the many knife wounds penetrated @entity1 's skin			1
their pattern suggests they had been inflicted with some deliberation rather than a significant degree of force			0
