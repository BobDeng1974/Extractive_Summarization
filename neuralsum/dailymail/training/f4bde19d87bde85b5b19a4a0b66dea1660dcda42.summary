@entity1 's ' twin ' , @entity0 , is now a barren world with a crushing atmosphere , acid raining from its skies and blistering temperatures of @entity7 ( 890 ° f )			0
but scientists believe this hellish planet may once have had enough water in its atmosphere to cover its surface in an ocean 80ft ( 25 metres ) deep			2
while the planet was too warm for that water to have fallen as rain , a new study suggests @entity0 may instead have had huge oceans of supercritical co2 , which were recently found to be capable of harbouring life			1
hellish planet : while @entity0 was too warm for water to have fallen as rain , a new study suggests the now barren world ( pictured ) may have had huge oceans of supercritical co2			1
supercritical @entity23 is created when liquids and gases reach their temperature and pressure thresholds , creating a fluid ' presently , the atmosphere of @entity0 is mostly carbon dioxide , 96.5 per cent by volume , ' lead study author @entity32 , a theoretical physicist at @entity33 told @entity34			1
supercritical @entity23 is created when liquids and gases reach their temperature and pressure thresholds , creating a fluid that has features of both a liquid and gas			1

carbon dioxide becomes supercritical when its temperature exceeds 305 degrees @entity47 ( 32 ° c ) and its pressure goes beyond 72.9 - the standard atmosphere at sea level			0
on @entity1 , it 's increasingly used in application such as dry cleaning or to sterilise medical equipment			0
a recent study claimed it could also be capable of sustaining life on planets without water , such as @entity0			2
scientists had previously thought the physical properties of supercritical fluids changed slowly with pressure and temperature			0
but computer simulations by professor @entity32 found this was n't the case			0
the huge atmospheric pressures on @entity0 in its early days may have caused the supercritical carbon dioxide to look like soap bubbles , or as professor @entity32 puts it : ' a bubble of gas that is covered by a thick layer of liquid			1
' ' this in turn makes it plausible that geological features on @entity0 - like rift valleys , river - like beds , and plains - are the fingerprints of near - surface activity of liquid - like supercritical carbon dioxide , ' professor @entity32 told @entity34			0
the discovery follows a study in november that found life could thrive in planet 's that contain supercritical co2			1
professor @entity91 at @entity92 compared enzymes in carbon dioxide and in water , and found that they were more stable in supercritical co2			2
a study earlier this year argued that bacteria ( pictured ) could exist on planets that contain a ' supercritical ' @entity23			0
if @entity0 did contain oceans of supercritical co2 , the planet may contain remnants of life supercritical carbon dioxide makes enzymes choosier about the molecules they bind to , leading to fewer side reactions			1
they also found that a number of species of bacteria are tolerant of supercritical carbon dioxide			0
previous studies have found that microbes can live near liquid carbon dioxide trapped under @entity1 's oceans – and area where the fluid can become supercritical			0
if @entity0 did contain oceans of supercritical co2 , the planet may contain remnants of life .			1

supercritical @entity23 is a *substance* that has features of both a liquid and gas
previous study found it could allow life to thrive on planets without water
now scientists in @entity134 claim atmospheric pressures on @entity0 meant oceans of supercritical co2 are likely to have once covered the hellish planet
they would have appeared as bubble of gas covered by a thick layer of liquid
