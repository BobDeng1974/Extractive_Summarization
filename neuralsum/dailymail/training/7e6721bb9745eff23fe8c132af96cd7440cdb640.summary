@entity0 could be a precious weapon in the fight against antibiotic resistance			1
scientists have shown that giving tiny amounts of silver at the same time as antibiotics makes the drugs up to a thousand times more effective			0
the finding comes in the wake of warnings by @entity14 ’s top doctor that the rise of drug - resistant superbugs could trigger an ‘ apocalyptic scenario ’ in which even routine operations such as hip surgery become deadly because we have run out of antibiotics			1
giving tiny amounts of silver at the same time as antibiotics makes the drugs up to a thousand times more effective professor dame @entity26 said that unless urgent action is taken , the ‘ ticking timebomb ’ of growing antibiotic resistance could leave millions vulnerable to untreatable bugs within a generation			1
@entity33 researcher dr @entity32 said : ‘ the number of antibiotic resistant strains in our hospitals and communities is growing and is growing dramatically and has been for some time			2
‘ and this development is accompanied by a drop in new antibiotics being developed and approved			0
‘ we are taking a different approach			0
instead of trying to develop a completely new antibiotic , we are trying to enhance the ones we already have			0
’ in experiments on mice , the @entity47 researchers found that giving silver with antibiotics made them between ten and a thousand times better at fighting infections			2
in some cases , bugs classed as antibiotic resistant became treatable			1
@entity14 's top doctor warned the rise of drug - resistant superbugs ( pictured ) could trigger an ' apocalyptic scenario ' in which routine operations become deadly although silver has long been known to have anti-bacterial properties , if used alone , it has to be given in such high amounts that it can be poisonous to the body			1
the experiments suggest it will be safe to use it in very small amounts with existing antibiotics			0
the drugs could be laced with silver or covered in a fine coating of the precious metal and used to tackle dangerous stomach bugs , urinary tract infections or hard - to - treat films of bacteria that coat catheters			2
the research , detailed in the journal @entity84 , also worked out how silver helps kill bugs			0
the metal makes bacteria more ‘ leaky ’ , allowing antibiotics to get inside them and kill them			1
plus , it boosts production of dangerous oxygen molecules that aid and abet the death .			0

silver could be used to help fight antibiotic resistance
can make bugs which are antibiotic resistant treatable
works by making bacteria more ‘ leaky ’ , allowing antibiotics to get inside them and kill them
