by @entity0 a mother - of - one has spoken out about her experiences - good and bad - of being a surrogate for gay and infertile couples			1
@entity6 , a 36 - year - old language teacher based in @entity7 , @entity8 , has been a surrogate twice ; birthing a baby girl in 2009 and a boy in 2011 , both for gay male couples - which were ' joyous ' experiences			1
she was forced to walk away from her third surrogacy arrangement , however , after the ' rich , well - known ' couple , led her to feel like ' a commodity ' , ms @entity6 tells @entity19 at the @entity20			1
surrogate : @entity6 , 36 , ( pictured ) has readily given birth to two babies , both for gay couples , but walked out on a third arrangement because the couple led her to feel like a ' commodity ' ' i definitely come from breeding stock , and pregnancy is a relatively easy process for me , ' she says			1
' i entered into the whole thing with my eyes open			0
nobody forced me to do anything			0
' ms @entity6 , who has a 12 - year - old son with her police officer husband , @entity37 , was first introduced to the concept when she saw a news report on the difficulties faced by gay couples wishing to adopt or foster children			1
instead of ' picketing ' for the cause , she decided to volunteer her womb for the purpose of surrogacy			2
initially , her son was enraged because he assumed his mother would be ' having sex with two men ' , and her husband thought she was ' crazy ' , but once everything was explained and carefully considered , all parties were on board			0
ms @entity6 found @entity55 and @entity56 , a gay couple based in @entity58 , through @entity59 , and instantly ' clicked ' with them , bonding not only over the baby she would later birth for them - a result of @entity55 's sperm and @entity56 's sister 's egg - but also their shared interests			1
popular route : @entity72 host @entity71 and his wife @entity73 ( left ) welcomed their daughter @entity75 ( right ) via a surrogate last july , after they failed to conceive naturally proud parents : @entity78 ( left ) and his partner of 27 years , @entity79 ( right ) had their first son @entity80 in 2012 , also via a surrogate gestational surrogacy uses in @entity83 ( @entity84 ) to create an embryo using the eggs from the prospective mother or donor and sperm from the father or donor that is then implanted in a surrogate			1
this allows the intended parents to have a genetically related child			0
the success rate varies widely based on the quality of the egg and sperm , as well as the age and health of the surrogate			2
gestational carriers are officially recognized in only 15 states and are illegal in some			2
' [ @entity106 ] preferred a gay couple for selfish reasons , ' she reveals			0
' a heterosexual couple is coming to a surrogate already crestfallen because they ’ve tried and failed			2
' going forward , a lot of their sense will be wrapped up with those kind of emotions and possibly some envy and jealousy			0
but working with a gay couple is joyous			2
' ms @entity6 was paid $ 20,000 for the process , and underwent a ' full psychological ' evaluation and a home visit ' , before giving birth to a healthy girl in @entity7 , in 2009			1
in the delivery room , the baby was whisked away as quickly as possible , before any ' biological urge ' could present itself			0
' i did hear a cry , ' she says			0
' but it was like hearing the neighbor ’s kid crying			0
i think it would have been harder for me if i had n’t bonded with the dads			0
' heartbreak : @entity139 host @entity137 and her husband @entity140 ( left ) have one son , @entity142 ( right ) who was born via a surrogate two years ago , and earlier this month , the same surrogate tragically miscarried their second child success stories : hunger games star @entity146 and her husband @entity147 ( left ) have two children born via a surrogate , and @entity150 has a four - year - old son , @entity151 ( seen right ) , with partner @entity152 ms @entity6 agreed to be a surrogate for the second time , for @entity156 and @entity157 , close friends of @entity56 and @entity55 , and gave birth to their son in 2011 ; another healthy and happy experience			1
in more recent times , she entered into a third arrangement , this time with a ' well known ' and ' mega rich ' couple from the entertainment industry , who she ca n't name for legal reasons - and who were due to pay her a ' significantly higher ' fee than she had been offered previously			0
' it was like hearing the neighbor ’s kid crying			0
i think it would have been harder for me if i had n’t bonded with the dads ' unlike with the first two couples , she found it impossible to ' bond ' with these people , who treated the process like ' a business transaction ' ; so much so that ms @entity6 started referring to herself as a ' commodity			2
' not only were the couple initially insistent on having a boy - testing the embryos five days after fertilization for gender - but when they eventually settled on two female embryos , they asked ms @entity6 to ' reduce ' , or terminate , one of them if they both ' took , ' because they did n't want to raise twins			2
growing family : @entity192 ( left ) and @entity193 ( right ) have one biological son , @entity195 ( center ) and twin girls , @entity198 and @entity199 ( pictured ) , who were born via a surrogate in 2009 happy family : @entity202 and husband @entity203 ( pictured ) had daughter @entity204 naturally ( right ) and @entity205 ( left ) via a surrogate additionally , the picky couple were eager to choose a ' particularly attractive ' egg donor , despite the fact that her eggs were ' sub-par ' , because , according to ms @entity6 , they were ' obsessed with looks			1
' ' i could n’t believe that this kind of misogyny exists			0
my moral compass kept flicking off and i had to walk away , ' she says			2
although her experience with this couple was a blot on her otherwise successful track record , ms @entity6 says she still feels ' incredibly ' happy about the children she was able to provide the four prior dads			1
her decision to undergo this journey echoes the increasing popularity of the practice			0
while wealthy @entity228 couples have been enlisting the services of surrogates in developing countries such as @entity233 and parts of @entity235 for some time now , surrogacy in the @entity228 is becoming more common			1
according to the @entity236 , the number of children born to gestational surrogates - carriers that bear no genetic link to the child they carry - more than doubled between 2004 and 2008 , with just over 5,000 babies estimated to have been born via this delivery during that time period			1
' i could n’t believe that this kind of misogyny exists			0
my moral compass kept flicking off and i had to walk away ' and in 2012 alone , 1,898 babies were born via a gestational surrogate , according to the @entity249			1
surrogate mothers can expect to make an average of between $ 12,000 and $ 25,000 for the service - much more in some cases - but laws around ' commercial surrogacy ' vary widely according to state			1
states which are most surrogacy friendly include @entity258 and @entity259 - where the highest number of surrogacy births occur - as well as @entity262 , @entity263 and @entity264			2
commercial surrogacy in @entity58 is illegal , and @entity267 , for example , forbids absolutely all surrogacy agreements			0
surrogacy has proven to be a popular route for wealthy couples and celebrities in the @entity228 @entity72 host @entity71 and his wife @entity73 were the most recent to welcome a child , a daughter @entity75 , via surrogacy last july			1
designer @entity78 and his partner @entity79 had their first child , a son called @entity80 , in 2012 , and other notable stars to have taken this road include hunger games star @entity146 and her husband @entity283 , @entity139 host @entity137 and husband @entity140 , actress @entity202 and husband @entity203 , @entity150 and his partner @entity152 , @entity192 and husband @entity193 , as well as @entity286 , @entity287 and @entity288 .			0
