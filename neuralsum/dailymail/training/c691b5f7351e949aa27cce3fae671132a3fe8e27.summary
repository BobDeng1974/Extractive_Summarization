by @entity0 published : 22:49 est , 2 december 2013 updated : 05:10 est , 3 december 2013 a fitness - obsessed co-ed that became unable to sleep last year made a startling discovery during a routine medical exam			1
@entity5 , 22 , of @entity6 , exercised almost every single day , taught yoga and stayed in top shape			1
what she thought was a product of drinking too much water turned out to be a cancerous tumor growing inside her			2
the tumor was on her kidneys and forced her body to produce hormones that kept her awake almost continuously , she recalled to @entity19			0
she could n't sleep : @entity5 did n't think being awake more was abnormal ‘ i had a lot of energy , ’ ms @entity5 said			1
‘ i was n't sleeping ... i was always on the go , i was never tired			0
’ ms @entity5 thought the high amounts of water she was drinking caused her to wake up often during the night , so she did nothing about it until a medical exam made a shocking discovery			1
doctors discovered last fall that her blood pressure was high , ‘ through the roof ’ high , but her potassium levels were low – it stumped them			1
‘ that really freaked me out because them not knowing what 's wrong with me , they 're doctors , you know ? ’ @entity38			2
after ruling out a heart condition , doctors checked her kidneys at the urging of her mother			2
the sonogram stumped doctors as well , it appeared she had one combined kidney , throwing the co-ed into further panic as she was whisked to an mri			1
horrified : ms @entity5 was shocked when doctors told her she had a large tumor inside her the sonogram technician asked if she felt anything , ms @entity54 replied she felt fine			1
the @entity56 showed she had two kidneys , but instead she horrifyingly had a tumor almost the size of a grapefruit growing inside her			0
‘ i was in complete shock , ’ ms @entity5 recalled to @entity19 , saying she called her parents because she needed surgery			1
‘ then , i got so upset honestly			0
i had no idea where this came from			0
’ she also soon learned the tumor was producing the hormones aldosterone and cortisol – which led doctors to fear it was cancerous			2
her surgery was scheduled at @entity72 in @entity6 for october 31 , 2012 – @entity73 night			0
better now : ms @entity5 is cancer - free and able to sleep as if having her surgery on the same night ghouls and ghosts run amok was n’t bad enough , @entity76 unleashed it ’s wrath on the city only two days prior			1
the hospital was overcrowded and short - staffed , but her medical team was determined to save her life			0
the 22 - year - old was in the hospital during the storm , unaware of the damage it caused to the city , but was wheeled past several people displaced by the worst storm in the city ’s history			0
‘ i was just kind of a little teary , ’ she remembered			0
doctors removed the tumor , stage 2 cancer			2
described as adrenal cortical carcinoma , the tumor was growing on her liver – it affects one in several hundred thousand people , ms @entity5 ’ doctor told @entity19			1
ms @entity5 awoke after the surgery with no electricity because of the storm , but that mattered little to her			1
‘ i was just happy to be alive , ’ she said			0
she is now cancer - free , but takes medication to stay that way			0
one of the side effects of the medication happens to be drowsiness – she ca n’t do hot yoga anymore , but now she can sleep .			0

@entity5 thought her *inability* to sleep was a result of high energy from always working out
doctors discovered high blood pressure and low potassium last fall
they first thought she had one combined kidney , but soon discovered something even more shocking
