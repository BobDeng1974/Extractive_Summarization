i spent a good chunk of my 20s in love - with my boyfriend @entity4 and with @entity5 , where we lived for five amazing , crazy years			1
he got a great job over there and i followed , leaving behind family , friends and my job			2
people thought i was mad to drop everything and run but i never had any doubts			0
and even if it had all gone wrong , i could always have flown back to life in @entity17			0
we became a tight - knit team of two and whilst other friends diligently alternated between his and hers families for @entity42 , we did our own thing , eating turkey sandwiches from a corner deli , or inviting @entity5 friends for eclectic @entity51 / @entity50 / @entity49 / @entity48 parties			1
when we got new jobs back in @entity54 and returned in the depths of winter it was a damp , dreary december nothing like the magical snowy christmases we 'd been used to			0
it was difficult adjusting to home when @entity5 felt like our real home			1
but we cheered up when we got engaged in february and were looking forward to returning to @entity24 for a holiday in june			1
i do n't know whose idea it was to get married in @entity5 , but about a fortnight before our trip we both seemed to have the idea at once			1
it seemed so obvious because the city was such a huge part of our lives together			0
sworn to secrecy ! best friend @entity71 was the only witness to @entity20 and @entity4 ’s wedding @entity73 time : the bride and groom were casually dressed in matching white and smiled for selfies on the way to their wedding i looked into it and it was pretty straightforward - apply for licence , wait 24 hours , take one witness , turn up on the day and queue at @entity5 's @entity23 with all the other brides and grooms			1
i knew i had to tell my parents but it was n't so much a matter of getting permission as casually dropping it into conversation at breakfast			1
' we 're thinking of getting married in @entity5 , ' i said			1
' if you really do n't want us to , we might not			0
' stunned silence , then huge grins			0
@entity99 always maintains she knew we 'd do it before we really knew ourselves			2
it was easy to keep quiet - our @entity51 friends just thought we were excited about the trip , and we swore our witness @entity104 to secrecy			1
he was our best friend , an @entity51 in @entity5 who 'd recently moved to @entity105 and understood the pull of the city as much as we did			1
wedding feast : @entity104 enjoys a hot dog in downtown @entity24 right after the wedding			2
the couple toasted the union with street vendor hot dogs and @entity115 in plastic glasses @entity118 reception : the newlyweds had cocktails on the roof garden of the @entity122 - where @entity20 furtively tossed the wedding bouquet over @entity124 ’ @entity126 sculpture we wanted a get out clause just in case @entity104 could n't get time off work or we changed our minds at the last minute - another reason why a secret wedding seemed the right thing to do			1
i worried @entity51 friends and family would be disappointed they could n't be there for the fun			2
but we also wanted it to be our wedding , about us as a couple , not about what colour the napkins needed to be , or who to sit where on the table plan , or what type of saucepans to put on a wedding list			2
the day itself was brilliant			0
we walked across @entity30 towards @entity23 - something we 'd done so many times before , sightseeing with family , or after drunken nights out in quirky bars or warehouse parties			2
tourists cheered us and it felt like the whole city was our friend			0
@entity23 itself was an unforgettable experience - my bouquet was unceremoniously dumped on the security scanner belt and checked for concealed weapons , just like everything else , because the building housed law courts filled with plenty of ' no - goodniks '			2
there was a lot of hanging around , form - filling , queuing for official stamps and then the ceremony itself - barely five minutes to say ' i do ' and for @entity4 to pretend my engagement ring was a wedding ring			0
party time : @entity20 embraces a guest as the couple celebrate their marriage with friends in the @entity184 , one of their favourite @entity187 bars a married man : @entity4 pops open a bottle of champagne with friends the blushing bride : @entity20 and @entity4 leaving the @entity194 on their wedding night we celebrated with hot dogs from a street vendor and champagne in plastic glasses			1
our @entity5 friends were out in force after work - we 'd suggested a drinking session and when a few cried off we had to admit we had ' an appointment at @entity23 ' and they might want to rearrange plans to join us on a pub crawl that kicked off with cocktails on the roof garden of the @entity122 of @entity211 everyone promised to keep @entity115 photos off @entity214 and any wedding - related chat had to stay in @entity5 because i was terrified the news would get back to @entity51 before we did			1
thankfully they kept quiet and when we flew back to @entity54 we began a mammoth ring - round to tell our nearest and dearest that we 'd had a lovely holiday thank you , and oh yes , we decided to get married while we were there			0
@entity4 was nervous phoning his mum and dad - we 'd tried to call them on the wedding day but they were on holiday in @entity231 and had no mobile reception			0
to say they were surprised would be an understatement - fortunately they were ( and still are ) very happy for us			0
most of our friends were thrilled			0
every phone call followed the same pattern - unexpected announcement followed by exclamations , laughter and promises to email pictures , as if some definite proof were required			0
older relatives asked what vows we 'd said ; i had no idea and had to look them up online			0
but we kept everyone sweet by promising an epic party on our first anniversary , and true to our word we planned a marquee - full of drinks , dinner and dancing with a healthy mix of @entity51 friends and @entity5 guests who 'd experienced it all the first time round			1
i walked up the aisle exactly a year later and renewed those vows , only this time i said : ' i did			2

@entity264 married *fiancee* @entity265 at @entity24 's @entity23
the couple , both 30 , had lived in the @entity268 for five years
only @entity20 's parents , a witness and their @entity5 friends knew
renewed vows on their first anniversary for loved ones who missed out
