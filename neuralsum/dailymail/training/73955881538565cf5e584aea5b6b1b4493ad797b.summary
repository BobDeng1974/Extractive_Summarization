by @entity0 published : 17:40 est , 14 may 2013 updated : 17:59 est , 14 may 2013 a @entity2 diplomat was expelled from @entity3 on tuesday after the @entity5 's security forces said that he tried to recruit a @entity3 agent			1
the @entity8 counter intelligence service claimed @entity9 was caught red - handed seeking to recruit a @entity3 intelligence officer			1
the @entity3 agency displayed evidence that they claimed to have found on @entity9 including wigs , packets of cash , a knife , map and compass , and a letter promising millions for ' long - term cooperation '			1
it alleged @entity9 was a @entity36 officer trying to recruit a @entity3 counter-terrorism officer who specializes in the volatile @entity39 in southern @entity3 , where the two @entity41 bombing suspects had their ethnic roots			1
@entity9 was handed over to @entity2 @entity35 officials , declared persona non grata and ordered to leave @entity3 immediately			1
he has diplomatic immunity , which protects him from arrest			0
the @entity47 would only confirm that @entity9 worked as an embassy employee , but would n't give any details about his employment record or responsibilities in @entity3			1
some officials also referred inquiries to the @entity36 , which declined comment			0
@entity9 was the first @entity2 diplomat to be publicly accused of spying in @entity3 in about a decade			1
while relations between the two countries have been strained , officials in both @entity56 and @entity24 sought to play down the incident			0
arrested : the @entity2 diplomat - suspected by @entity3 of being a @entity36 agent - was named as @entity9 seized : the @entity8 claimed a third secretary in the political section of the @entity2 @entity35 had attempted to recruit a @entity3 secret services official the @entity65 summoned @entity2 ambassador @entity66 to appear on wednesday in connection with the case			1
@entity66 said he would not comment on the spying allegation			0
@entity3 officials expressed indignation the @entity2 would carry out an espionage operation at a time when the two countries have been working to improve counterterrorism cooperation			1
' such provocative actions in the spirit of the @entity78 do nothing to strengthen mutual trust , ' the @entity65 said			0
@entity3 's @entity39 includes the provinces of @entity82 and @entity83			1
the suspects in the april 15 @entity41 bombings - @entity85 and his elder brother , @entity86 , who was killed in a manhunt are ethnic @entity89			0
@entity86 spent six months last year in @entity83 , now the center of an @entity92 insurgency			0
@entity2 investigators have been working with the @entity3 to try to determine whether @entity94 had established any contacts with militants in @entity83			2
despite the end of the @entity78 , @entity3 and the @entity2 still maintain active espionage operations against each other			2
last year , several @entity3 were convicted in separate cases of spying for the @entity2 and sentenced to lengthy prison sentences			1
but tuesday 's case had espionage elements that seemed more like @entity105 than @entity106 and le @entity107			0
detained : the @entity8 said @entity9 was in possession of two floppy wigs , three pairs of glasses , a map of @entity24 and a folding knife when he was detained @entity3 state tv showed pictures of a man said to be @entity9 , wearing a baseball cap and a blond wig , lying face down on the ground			1
the man , without the wig , was also shown sitting at a desk in the offices of the @entity8 , the @entity8			0
two wigs , a compass , a map of @entity24 , a pocket knife , three pairs of sunglasses and envelopes of 500 euro notes ( each bill worth $ 649 ) were among the items the @entity8 displayed on a table			1
the @entity8 also produced a typewritten letter that it described as instructions to the @entity3 agent who was the target of @entity9 's alleged recruitment effort			1
the letter , in @entity3 and addressed ' dear friend , ' offers $ 100,000 to ' discuss your experience , expertise and cooperation ' and up to $ 1 million a year for long - term cooperation			1
the letter also includes instructions for opening a @entity151 account to be used for communication and an address to write			0
it is signed ' your friends '			0
' if this is genuine , then it 'll be seen to be appallingly bad tradecraft - being caught with a '' @entity160 '' guide and a wig			0
' he would have had to have been pretty stupid , ' said @entity163 , a professor at @entity164 who studies the @entity3 security services			2
@entity166 , director of the @entity167 at @entity168 , called the evidence bizarre			0
stash : he was detained with ' special technical devices , written instructions for the person he was recruiting , a lot of cash , and things to help change one 's appearance , ' according to the @entity8 statement : ' recently , the @entity2 intelligence service has made repeated attempts to recruit the staff of @entity3 law enforcement agencies and special services , ' according to the @entity8 ' i would n't have thought that spies gave each other written instructions , ' he said in a telephone interview			1
@entity166 also noted that the @entity8 had displayed @entity9 's official diplomatic @entity192 , suggesting he was carrying it along with the spy paraphernalia when he was detained			1
' maybe this is what the @entity36 has come to , maybe the propaganda folks in the @entity5 think we are this stupid , or maybe both , ' he said			0
a five - minute video produced by the @entity8 and shown on state tv showed a @entity3 official speaking to what appear to be three @entity2 diplomats who had come to pick up @entity9 in the @entity8 office			1
the official , whose face is blurred , alleged that @entity9 called an unidentified @entity8 counterintelligence officer who specializes in the @entity39 at 11.30pm on monday he then said that after the officer refused to meet , @entity9 called him a second time and offered 100,000 euros if he would provide information to the @entity2 the @entity3 official said the @entity8 was flabbergasted			1
he pointed to high - level efforts to improve counterterrorism cooperation , specifically @entity211 director @entity210 's visit to @entity24 last week and phone calls between president @entity214 and @entity3 president @entity215			2
' at a time when the presidents of the two countries are striving to improve the climate of relations between the two countries , this citizen , in the name of the @entity2 government , commits a most serious crime here in @entity24 , ' the official said			2
@entity47 spokeswoman @entity227 confirmed that an officer at the @entity35 in @entity24 was briefly detained and released			0
mission : the website of the @entity2 embassy in @entity3 informs that its political section is engaged in ' bringing to the attention of the @entity3 government the @entity2 position on the issues of foreign policy and security ' ' we have seen the @entity65 announcement and have no further comment at this time , ' said @entity227 , who was in @entity242 with secretary of state @entity243			1
@entity244 was immediately known about @entity9			0
a third secretary is an entry level position at the @entity47 , the lowest diplomatic rank in the foreign service			0
@entity215 has stoked anti-american sentiments among @entity3 in recent years in what is seen as an effort to build support at home			0
he also appears to have a genuine distrust of @entity3 nongovernmental organizations that receive @entity2 funding , which he has accused of being fronts that allow the @entity2 government to meddle in @entity3 's political affairs			1
hundreds of @entity261 have been searched this year as part of an ongoing crackdown by the @entity3 government			2
questions : a letter the agent carried suggested the @entity2 government was willing to pay up to $ 1 million a year plus bonuses to his unidentified potential @entity3 recruit , if the letter released by the @entity8 is genuine @entity163 said the public exposure of @entity9 suggests a political purpose behind the detention			1
he said these kinds of spying incidents happen with some frequency , but making such a big deal of them is rare			0
the arrest of @entity29 is just the latest twist in the long history of spying between the @entity2 and @entity3			2
famously , 10 @entity3 sleeper agents were arrested in june 2010 and accused of pretending to be ordinary americans while secretly plotting against the country			2
the best - known is @entity286 , above , who has become a major celebrity in her home country since being deported from the @entity2 in the @entity78 period , however , @entity2 - @entity33 espionage was often a matter of life and death - in 1985 , military officer @entity289 was shot dead by a @entity33 sentry while spying in @entity296			0
one of the war 's major crises was caused by the shooting down of an @entity2 spy plane in 1960 and the subsequent capture of its pilot			2
' more often , the etiquette is that these things get dealt with quite quietly â€” unless they want to get a message out , ' @entity163 said			0
' if you identify an embassy staffer who is a spy for the other side , your natural impulse is to leave them be , because once you identify , you can keep tabs on them , see who they talk to and everything else			0
' ' there 's no reason to make a song and dance , detain them , eject them , ' he said			0
@entity166 said @entity9 's detention should be seen as part of @entity215 's confrontation with the opposition and not as something likely to have a major impact on @entity2 - @entity3 relations			1
' i think this is mostly for domestic consumption in @entity3 so that people say , '' look at these naughty @entity2 trying to meddle in our internal affairs and spy on us , '' ' @entity166 said			2
' but everybody 's got spies everywhere so i do n't see this as a major issue			0
' in @entity56 , @entity47 spokesman @entity342 also said the incident was unlikely to hamper @entity2 - @entity3 relations			2
' i 'm not sure i 'd read too much into one incident one way or another , ' he told reporters , and pointed to @entity243 's meeting with @entity3 foreign minister @entity350 in @entity242 on tuesday evening			1
' we have a very broad and deep relationship with the @entity3 across a whole host of issues , and we 'll continue to work on our diplomacy with them directly			0
' @entity357 , who heads the international affairs committee in @entity3 's parliament , wrote in a @entity361 post that the spy scandal would be short - lived and would not interfere in @entity243 and @entity350 's discussions aimed at bridging deep differences over the civil war in @entity366			2
' but the atmosphere is not improving , ' @entity357 commented			0
release : @entity9 was held overnight before being released to @entity2 officials and expelled from @entity3			1
