the third - tier side will face @entity1 in the semi-finals of the @entity10 having already knocked @entity11 and @entity12 out of the competition			1

' the @entity6 clubs would want to avoid each other , it 's just the nature of the beast			1
' but i do n't think people will take us lightly , because of the results we 've had			1
in the last calendar year we 've beaten five @entity6 clubs			1
' the semi-final will be different in that it 's over two legs			2
but with the atmosphere and the type of performance we can get at home , we know if we 're still in the tie when we get back to @entity56 then there will be a game on			2
' we had a great run last year , getting to the semi-final , and this year we 've backed that up with some really good performances			2

@entity16 boss @entity91 , who made seven changes but still fielded an experienced side , admitted : ' they looked sharper than us all over the pitch			0
' they were brighter and better than us and looked like a team that had 10 days without playing a game - we were playing our fourth and looked lethargic			0
' they thoroughly deserved their win			0
they played well and you 've got to give them the credit			0
' look at their record - they got to the semi-finals last year and this year are in the semi-finals of the @entity10			1
