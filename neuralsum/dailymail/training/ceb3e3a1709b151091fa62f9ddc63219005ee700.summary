by @entity1 reporter published : 10:23 est , 2 february 2014 @entity3 : 10:36 est , 2 february 2014 if you happen to live in the @entity7 or the central plains , there 's a good chance that you 're excited about this year 's @entity10 - according to a county - by - county map of football fandom , it 's likely you 're either a @entity13 or @entity14 fan			1
. @entity16 's data science team has used information gathered by the social media website to chart every county in the @entity22 ' @entity21 allegiance			1
the results are n't all that shocking			0
geography : according to this map created using information from @entity16 @entity21 fandom is incredibly regional for example , according to the map , if you live in @entity30 , chances are you 're a @entity30 fan			1
if you live in @entity33 or the lower @entity34 , you 're likely a @entity35 fan			0
however , there are a few interesting allegiances that do n't seem to make any sort of geographical sense			0
@entity41 , for example , appears to be a bit confused - which makes sense considering the closest @entity21 team is located in @entity45 , which is nearly 1,500 miles away			2
according to the map , @entity41 are primarily loyal to the @entity47 , but there are several counties within the state that like other teams , like the @entity52 and the @entity53			0
@entity55 - @entity54 , @entity56 , @entity57 : the @entity57 are the only team to have but one county in the entire country backing them @entity60 is a bit of an anomaly , as well			1
according to the map , @entity63 tend to like teams from all over the country - despite having three @entity21 teams of their own , there are pockets of the state that are home to @entity71 , @entity30 , @entity53 , @entity47 , and @entity73 fans			0
@entity60 's random allegiances likely are due to the fact that the state is home to a large community of transplants , many of whom are retirees from cities all across the country - who bring their football loyalty with them			2
if you 're a @entity57 fan who does n't live on @entity88 , there 's a good chance your sundays feel awfully lonely - according to the map , the @entity57 are the only team to have the supports of just one county : @entity94 , which is the western half of @entity88			1
are you ready ? @entity96 is just a few short hours away !			0

according to the map , the @entity57 only have the support of one county
@entity60 and @entity41 are home to a *diverse* group of football fans
the map was created by @entity16 's data science team
