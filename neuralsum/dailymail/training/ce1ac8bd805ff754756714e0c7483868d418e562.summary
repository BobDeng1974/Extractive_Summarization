the return of the @entity4 v @entity2 fixture next week seems to have captured the imagination of football fans far more north of the border			1
the friendly at @entity10 ’s @entity9 on tuesday is on course to be a sell - out apart from the @entity4 section of the stadium			2
the @entity15 were given an allocation of 7,200 for their official supporters ’ club but have sold only 5,077 — and hundreds of those have been cancelled after the insistence that the tickets were collected in person in @entity10 before the match , for security reasons			1
@entity4 have not sold their full allocation of tickets for their friendly clash with @entity2 in @entity10 @entity27 takes instruction from @entity29 as @entity4 prepare for their forthcoming internationals @entity4 are set to play a @entity32 qualifier against @entity33 before facing @entity2 in a friendly @entity34 stands with his bib over his head as @entity4 train at @entity38 @entity39 will be pleased that their security arrangements have rooted out potential troublemakers plus touts looking to sell seats in the @entity46 end to the @entity48 market			1
but the empty spaces among the travelling support reflects the match taking place on midweek and @entity4 fans ’ continued upset that watching games at @entity39 is now worth double the loyalty points for @entity32 tickets compared to going to away matches			1
and like in @entity60 and @entity61 , that grievance will be the subject of numerous chants by the @entity4 fans who do travel to @entity2			1
the problem with overseas tv feeds of 3pm saturday @entity66 matches being beamed into @entity68 pubs and clubs — prevalent at the start of the season — has been resolved to the extent that @entity73 , the biggest offenders , will be allowed to show confiscated saturday afternoon games across their @entity77 territory after the international break			0
@entity80 manager @entity79 was at @entity39 to watch the recent @entity82 game starring the @entity83 @entity84 , the @entity80 owner satisfied @entity79 ’s relentless team are on course to becoming no 1 in the country , has charged new commercial chief @entity88 with replicating that success off the field			1
but @entity91 are way ahead of @entity80 in the commercial table			2
meanwhile @entity79 , who was at @entity39 to watch the @entity93 , had a pre-match touchline conversation with @entity95 , singular owner of the @entity83 who takes on the @entity82 authorities in much the same manner @entity98 does over here			1
@entity100 owner @entity99 , who does n’t look like he ’s been near a gym recently , is nevertheless going to attempt to revolutionize the busy fitness market			1
@entity99 ’s @entity103 are opening 200 gyms nationwide , starting in @entity105			2
they will have a joining fee of £ 10 and just £ 5 - a - month membership			0
this compares with the @entity110 owned @entity112 gym at @entity113 where 3,000 members pay £ 40 - a - month for facilities that include an indoor pool			0
@entity100 owner @entity99 ( right ) cuts an unlikely figure to try and revolutionize the @entity68 fitness market @entity120 ’s sponsor woe @entity120 , general secretary of the @entity15 , claimed a few weeks ago that there would be a sponsor signed up for the @entity124 third round			1
and the clock is ticking with no backer in sight , according to @entity39 insiders , and just four weeks until the draw for the third round is broadcast live			2
@entity120 is leaving anyway but heads will have to roll if no sponsor is attracted for this marquee endorsement			0
meanwhile , the @entity15 are understood to have agreed to use headhunters to find @entity120 ’s replacement when chairman @entity136 had wanted to explore the option of doing the search in - house to save money			2
that would certainly have left @entity136 open to accusations of cronyism in filling one of football ’s most important roles			0
@entity147 invited members of their 1970 winning @entity150 side to their @entity152 match against @entity153 whom they beat 4 - 3 on aggregate 44 years ago			0
but bizarrely @entity155 do not recognise the @entity150 competition as they did not run it and there is no reference to it anywhere on their website or official records			0
@entity147 invited their former @entity150 winners to watch them lose a three goal lead against @entity153 the murky backdrop to @entity167 ’s ownership of @entity168 is that former managing director @entity169 has now been locked up in a @entity171 jail for six months without facing a criminal charge			0
@entity169 ’s latest move is for his lawyers to write a 78 - page legal letter to the @entity177 representatives , @entity178 , of his former employees @entity180 alleging they have leaked information to the media about @entity169 ’s private life			0
@entity169 ’s @entity177 representatives have also received heavy legal letters in return .			0

@entity4 have not sold their full allocation for friendly against @entity2
@entity80 boss @entity79 met with @entity83 chief at @entity39
@entity100 owner @entity99 has plans to revolutionize the fitness market
the @entity15 are still *struggling* to find sponsors for the @entity124 @entity196
