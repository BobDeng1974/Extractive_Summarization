@entity0 has been named as @entity2 's new assistant manager and will combine the role with his post as @entity6 's no 2 for the @entity7			1
the 42 - year - old will work alongside @entity9 at @entity10 and said he was ' relishing the prospect ' of combining the two roles			1
' i am delighted to be joining @entity2 and i look forward to what promises to be an exciting challenge , ' @entity0 said in a statement released by @entity2 on tuesday afternoon			2
' i am relishing the prospect of linking up with @entity9 and combining both roles to the full advantage of both @entity2 and @entity25 '			2
@entity0 will begin his new job ahead of the @entity28 's return to pre-season training on monday			1
@entity9 said he was looking forward to @entity0 's input as @entity2 bid to improve on last season 's miserable 15th place finish in the @entity34			1
the manager said : ' @entity0 has a great knowledge of football , on the coaching side as well , and he 'll be a great asset and a big help to everybody here at @entity2 , ' @entity9 said			1
' i 'm really looking forward to working with him and i 'm delighted that he 's here			0
' as a player , he was one of the most accomplished in the history of the @entity34 and he 's brought that experience gained over many years into his career in coaching and management			0
the players will love working with him			0
' although we never played together , we competed against one another and he 's someone for whom i have a lot of time and respect			0
he has worked under some great managers , some of the most successful in the game , and he 'll be a great help to myself as well			0
help : @entity9 will be assisted by @entity0 as @entity2 look to improve on last season 's 15th place ' @entity0 brought @entity62 up out of the @entity63 and into the @entity34 , he gained further experience at @entity65 - where we were close rivals while i was manager at @entity68 - and he 's now working at international level as assistant manager with the @entity7			1
' all of that experience and knowledge along with the qualities he has as a longstanding , leading professional in the game means he will bring a lot to the table			0
we 're delighted to have him here			0
' @entity9 's coaching staff was significantly depleted last season when assistant @entity82 and football operations manager @entity81 were suspended and then sacked for unspecified disciplinary reasons			1
the former @entity62 and @entity65 manager returned to the game in november last year when @entity6 offered him the opportunity to return to the international fold			0
he has clearly enjoyed his time to date with the @entity7 , for whom he played with such distinction , and that proved a key factor in his decision to reject the vacancy at @entity95 following @entity97 's departure			2
@entity0 's presence within the @entity25 camp has raised his profile once again and @entity6 admitted at the height of the speculation at the end of may and the beginning of july that the former @entity106 skipper would inevitably be courted by other potential employers .			2

@entity0 will work as @entity9 's assistant at @entity2
he will *continue* in role as assistant to @entity6 for @entity7
starts work at @entity10 on monday as players begin pre-season training
