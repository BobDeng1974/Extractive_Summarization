by @entity0 for @entity1 a group of @entity4 alumni and friends helped one man ask the most important question of his life			0
@entity9 , 29 , decided to pop the question to girlfriend @entity11 , 27 , in a less than conventional way			0
rather than a candle - lit dinner and getting down on one knee , @entity13 spend over 10 months planning and filming a video to ask for @entity11 ’s hand in marriage , involving all their family and friends , and featuring all the special places in their relationship			1
@entity9 and fiancee @entity11 make a toast to their engagement moments after @entity13 popped the question @entity13 spent an astonishing 10 months filming and planning the video , keeping it all secret from @entity11 the video , which took months to make , begins with @entity13 sending out a text to family and friends @entity11 's friends are seen receiving @entity13 's text from all around the world , before rushing to the venue @entity13 told his girlfriend of seven years that they were going back to their old student union for a friend 's party , but that he would be late and join her there			1
as @entity11 waited at the party with some of her friends , the proposal video began to play on the screen			1
from he and his university friends riding a tank , to the @entity4 cheerleaders doing a routine , @entity13 fills the video with in - jokes and memories shared by the couple			1
speaking to @entity1 , @entity13 said of his ambitious project : ‘ ultimately the idea came from the notion that i wanted a proposal that turned immediately into the engagement party			2
the couple , seen here graduating together from @entity4 , have been together for over seven years ‘ the proposal itself was designed to take @entity11 back to the origins of our relationship - which was our time at @entity4 and the video was a way of making our closest friends and immediate family a part of it			1
‘ once i 'd made the realisation that a video was going to be the platform for the proposal i approached a friend who owns his own media production company @entity76			0
' it was at that point that the project really stepped up a notch because @entity81 was able to take all of my crazed ideas and turn it into a realistically achievable and exceptionally professional production			0
’ the film starts with @entity11 ’s friends and family around the world – from @entity90 to @entity91 to @entity92 - receiving a text from @entity13 telling them that ‘ @entity94 ’ will happen that evening			1
we see each person rushing to the venue , including @entity13 ’s ‘ @entity102 ’ university friends piling into a military tank to make their way to @entity101			2
each clip of film is filled with little memories shared between the couple and their family and friends			0
eventually friends hold up letters spelling out ‘ you had better say yes ’ before the camera meets @entity13 walking to the @entity113 to meet @entity11 in ‘ real time ’ , flowers in hand , accompanied by her loved ones			2
‘ it was crucial to me that the level of detail in the video meant @entity11 could watch it again and again discovering new bits of hidden meaning the more she watched it			2
a group of the couple 's friends don war paint and military gear to ride a tank to the venue for the couple , who met at @entity4 , their university has a special significance for them - so their friends dusted off their university cheer - leading outfits for the video roping in musician friends , the video is accompanied trumpets at some points ' as a result , every single person featured in the video is a friend or family member of @entity11 's and virtually every single prop in shot at any one time has a story behind it which holds hidden meaning to @entity11			1
' there are points in the video where you have to pause it just to see the detail but that adds a whole other layer of enjoyment to it for @entity11 and there are still certain things she 's yet to discover			2
‘ the web of lies and misdirection i had to concoct to keep @entity11 in the dark was something of a marvel			0
over the course of the production i was living a double life and even made fake train tickets to cover my tracks			0
‘ above and beyond everything though our friends and family were amazing at misleading @entity11 ; there were numerous staged conversations designed purely to plant fictitious notions in @entity11 's head , and for a period of 10 months there was around 80 people in a @entity11 's life who could at any moment have spilled the beans ! ’ however , @entity13 ’s complex scheme worked , as , when the video began to play at what @entity11 believed was a friend ’s birthday party she was absolutely caught off guard			1
the video eventually sees friends hold up letters spelling out ' you had better say yes ! ! ' ‘ i was n't suspicious in the slightest , we both work long hours so i never questioned it - even in the final lead up i thought i was in @entity101 for a friend 's birthday and was never given any reason to question it			0
‘ at the beginning i thought i was watching a video for our friend @entity81 who 's birthday party it supposedly was - when the alarm went off i thought the sound system had broken - it was n't until one of my best friends from @entity215 appeared on the screen that i realised it was too personal to me to be for anyone else			0
i suddenly thought to myself " oh my goodness is this it , is @entity13 proposing ? " ‘ i think what i was most overwhelmed at was the efforts everyone had gone to , to create something so truly amazing - i have n't stopped smiling from that moment , my cheeks even now ache			0
‘ the couple , who live together in @entity225 , @entity92 , met when they were both students at @entity227			0
the he camera meets @entity13 walking to the @entity113 to meet @entity229 , who is waiting indidifr yjre in ' real time ' @entity13 strides into the union , where @entity11 is waiting , flanked by friends , to pop the question when @entity13 arrives at the union he pulls @entity11 on stage and gets down on one knee			1
after the video , unsurprisingly , she says yes @entity11 says : ‘ @entity13 and i became good friends but there was one night in particular in the old @entity241 where @entity13 was a bit worse for wear , had wandered off to the bathroom and against my better judgement i confided my concern in a mutual friend saying " do n't tell him but i think i like @entity13 ? ! " ‘ as soon as @entity13 reappeared our friend immediately called out " @entity255 fancies you ! " to which @entity13 somewhat vacantly responded " brilliant " - and that was essentially the beginning of our relationship ! ' the pair plan to marry in 2016 , but @entity11 says the proposal is something she will remember forever ‘ the efforts of @entity13 , @entity81 , and all my friends and family put into helping create the most magical moment of my life is something i will never forget and i feel very blessed to have such incredible friends and family and of course my amazing fiancé - i am so excited for the next chapter of our future together ! ’			1
