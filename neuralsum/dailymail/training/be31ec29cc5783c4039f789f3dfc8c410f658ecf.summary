speculation was rife last week when an @entity2 - owned car was spotted driving around @entity3 fitted with @entity5 - style cameras			1
at the time , rumours suggested the firm was working on its own version of @entity10 's popular mapping site but there could be another explanation			0
a source claiming to be an @entity2 employee has hinted that the giant is developing a vehicle as part of a project that ' will change the landscape and give @entity20 a run for its money			1
' the email was sent to @entity31			2
it followed sightings of an @entity2 - owned car fitted with cameras ( pictured ) in @entity3 the email from the unnamed employee was sent to @entity31			1
it described ' vehicle development ' at the company but did n't reveal further information			0
in particular , @entity2 may be working on an electric car to rival @entity20 's range or a self - driving car that would ultimately also rival @entity10 's autonomous project			1
the cameras on the mysterious van could be used to scan the road and help engineers develop self - driving software , for example			1
claims that @entity2 is building a car may seem like a leap , but it is n't the first time such projects have been discussed by the @entity3 firm			1
in an interview last year , @entity2 board member @entity59 said that before his death in 2011 @entity61 had considered building a car			2
he told @entity64 : ' @entity61 was gon na design an @entity65			0
i think cars have an extraordinary opportunity for cool design			0
' this may seem like a leap for @entity2 to take , but it is n't the first time such projects have been discussed by the @entity3 firm			2

' alternatively , the @entity2 employee 's email could be referring to an advanced @entity81 in - car control system that would rival @entity20 's software			1
the @entity84 van with the equipment on the top was spotted by the blog @entity87 in @entity89			0
the blog owners apparently asked the driver what he was doing , but he refused to give an answer			0
but a video from last year shows a similar car , which later transpired to be an unmarked self - driving @entity84 caravan			1
in particular , @entity2 may be working on an electric car to rival @entity20 's range ( the @entity100 is pictured ) or the email could be referring to an advanced @entity81 in - car control system that would rival @entity20 's software alternatively , the vehicle spotted in @entity3 could be a self - driving car			1
the cameras on the mysterious van could be used to scan the road and help engineers develop autonomous software , for example			0
if @entity2 was developing such systems , they would would rival @entity10 's self - driving cars ( pictured ) according to 9to5mac , the @entity115 ( @entity115 ) confirmed the vehicle was leased to @entity2			1
the head of self - driving cars for @entity10 expects real people to be using them on public roads in two to five years			1
@entity121 said the cars would still be test vehicles , and @entity10 would collect data on how they interact with other vehicles and pedestrians			0
but mr @entity121 would n't give a date for putting driverless cars on roads en masse , saying that the system has to be safe enough to work properly			0
he told reporters last month at the @entity132 in @entity133 that he wants to reach the point where his test team no longer has to pilot the cars			0
with 12 cameras on top of the car , some have said that is too many for it to be a mapping car like @entity10 's @entity5			2
' too many cameras , ' said technology analyst @entity144			0
' it has cameras that are angled down at all four corners of the vehicle			0
' this would further lend itself to the self - driving car theory			1
' unfortunately for that theory , only six companies have been issued the permits necessary to test such vehicles , and @entity2 is n't one of them , ' said 9to5mac			0
' this brings us back to a much more likely conclusion : @entity2 is preparing to take on @entity10 's @entity5 with a similar offering in its own @entity163 software			2
' they said it might feature as part of the @entity167 9 upgrade due later this year , although it would likely begin only with select cities such as @entity169 and @entity89			0
this would plug a noticeable hole in @entity172 , which has been missing @entity5 - style images ever since @entity2 made it the default maps app for @entity81			1
when contacted by @entity175 , @entity2 declined to comment on the car in question or what its purpose was			1
with 12 cameras on top of the mysterious @entity2 car , some have said that is too many for it to be a mapping car like @entity10 's @entity5 ( pictured left )			1
@entity10 launched its @entity5 technology in 2007 , and has refined the technology ever since ( @entity5 screenshot near @entity189 in @entity190 pictured right )			2

claims were made by an employee in an email sent to @entity31
the unnamed source hinted that @entity2 is developing a vehicle as part of a project that ' will change the landscape '
email followed sightings of an @entity2 - owned car fitted with cameras
the @entity115 confirmed the car was registered to @entity2
some have speculated it could be taking images for a @entity5 rival
others have said the vehicle may be testing self - driving technology
@entity2 has so far declined to comment on the appearance of the car
