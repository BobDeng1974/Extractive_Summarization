no word yet on who purchased the home			2
sold : @entity1 's former mansion was recently sold for $ 7.43million final home : the @entity2 estate was @entity1 's last home , and where he died in 1947 @entity17 , founder of energy solutions conglomerate @entity18 , was the previous owner and bought the house as a fixer - upper for $ 5.56million , then put it back on the market a year later			1
@entity1 himself bought the home for $ 40,000 in 1928 from @entity24 of the @entity26 family			1
of course , he paid in cold , hard cash			0
the @entity29 revival compound sits on waterfront property the size of a football field on @entity33			2
' two @entity37 @entity36 villas could fit on this property , ' broker @entity34 told the @entity39			0
' you step up to this huge pool			0
' the size of the property was originally worrisome for the sellers since a buyer could knock down the building to take advantage of the large lot			0
' we hope that does n't happen			0
it 's such an important piece of @entity53 , ' @entity34 said			0
massive : the 1928 home is located on a lot the size of a football field , right on the waterfront of @entity33 a steal : @entity1 bought the home with $ 40,000 cash from a member of the @entity26 family fixer - upper : the home 's previous owner , @entity17 , bought the home to restore it and put it back on the market a year later @entity71 treasure : originally , the sellers were worried someone would purchase the home to tear it down and make use of the massive waterfront property after purchasing the property , @entity17 went about updating the mansion to it 's original gangster grandeur			1
features of the seven - bedroom property include a two - story cabana pool house , a private dock , a front gatehouse built by @entity1 for his guards , and an @entity88 powder room			2
and in case the new owners are paranoid , the whole property is encircled by a tall masonry wall			0
party house : @entity1 used the home to hold wild @entity96 - era fetes room for friends : the house has seven bedrooms as well as detached guest houses security : @entity1 himself added on a front gatehouse especially for his guards restored : one of the house 's powder rooms is still in it 's original @entity88 style haunting : @entity1 died in one of the upstairs bedrooms , but the broker insists that it is not at all creepy safe : the house is encircled by a tall masonry wall , perhaps , to keep rival gangsters at bay paranoid : @entity1 would sleep in the front room of the house so he could be aware of everyone coming and going @entity1 , the notorious @entity96 - era gangster is probably most well known for planning the 1929 @entity123 - which resulted in the murder of seven mobsters in @entity126			1
the @entity2 home is supposedly where he planned the massacre , and his alibi - since he was at the @entity3 home when the incident happened			1
though @entity1 was eventually arrested and imprisoned on a nearly decade - long sentence , he held onto the property			2
when he was released from @entity135 in 1939 , he returned to the @entity2 home and spent the rest of his years there			2
planning site : the home is where @entity1 supposedly planned the @entity123 of 1929 final years : @entity1 returned to the home after being released from @entity135 in 1939 and stayed there until his death in 1947 @entity1 died in the home in 1947 , suffering the last years of his life from syphilis			1
the disease degraded his mind to that of a child 's and apparently he slept in the front room , paranoid about who was coming and going from the house			0
according to @entity34 , @entity1 died in a room on the upstairs of the home , but it 's not at all spooky			1
' it used to be creepy , but after the renovation it 's this charming little room			0
everyone loves it up there			0
