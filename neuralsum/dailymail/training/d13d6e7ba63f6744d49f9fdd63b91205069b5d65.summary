by @entity0 from @entity2 to @entity1 , photo sharing apps have taken the digital world by storm			2
today everyone can be a photographer as we snap , edit and share our best views with the world			2
and now , one photographer is taking the photo sharing concept one step further with new site @entity14 designed to deliver photographs from complete strangers to your inbox			1
sharing : a new site called @entity14 sends subscribers a photo of a stranger from anywhere in the world every single day the concept behind the site is simple : sign up using your email address and every day a random photo will be delivered to your inbox from somebody that you do n't know			1
the service , set up by travel and lifestyle photographer , @entity33 , is inspired by @entity35 , a lottery where the winner gets the opportunity to write something and share it with the world			1
@entity14 describes itself as : ' one photo a day in your inbox , from a friend you just have n't met yet			1
' one day you could receive a photo of a cute kitten from someone in @entity47 , and the next day you could open your inbox to a snap of the beautiful beaches of @entity50			1
and one day you could be chosen to send your photo to every single subscriber			1
describing her new brainchild , @entity33 writes : ' a subscriber is chosen each day to share one photo they 've taken with the world			2
what will you share ? brainchild : set up by travel and lifestyle photographer , @entity33 , the site describes itself as : ' one photo a day in your inbox , from a friend you just have n't met yet ' ' i believe that photos can tell stories too , here 's your chance to tell yours			1
' speaking to @entity71 , @entity33 said : ' i launched the project less than a month ago			0
it started as a fun little project amongst friends , but the subscription list kept growing ! ' being a photographer , i often wished there was something like daily lotto , but for photos			2
i googled and could n't find anything out there , so i made it ! ' in each @entity14 a website link of the winner 's choosing is attached to their photo			1
often times it 's their blog , projects , but sometimes it 's charities			0
' and the @entity94 seems to be enjoying the new photo sharing concept			0
one user wrote : ' so far i 'm loving this > " one photo a day in your inbox , from a friend you just have n't met yet			1
' another added : ' @ gtmcknight awesome @entity101 today ! ! thank you ! ( @entity103 is awesome , too ! )			0
' what will you receive today ? one day you could receive a cute animal , and the next a lovely scenic snap from anywhere in the world while concerns may be raised that the site could go the same way as photo sharing app @entity1 , which saw users sending explicit photos to one another , user @entity109 says this wo n't be the case			1
she writes on @entity119 : ' well , it could be creepy , but it 's well - curated so you 're not receiving a photo of a different penis every day			1
' or any penises ever			0
not that penises ca n't be beautiful and artistic			0
the point is — this is about cool photography , not unclothed penises			0
' @entity33 added : ' i 'm putting my trust into this little community i 'm creating , so i believe everything has been , and will be tasteful			0
' of course , if it turns into a @entity130 , monitoring might have to be enforced …			0
because nobody wants that in their inbox at work ! ' tweet fans : the @entity94 seems to be enjoying the new photo sharing concept , which could see users receiving all sorts of amazing photography from across the globe on a daily basis photo sharing is big business			2
@entity1 , which launched in late 2011 and lets user send snaps to others for less than ten seconds , has already raised around £ 40 million in venture capital funding			0
over 200 million pictures are shared on the service daily and the company is valued at around £ 534 million			0
@entity2 , a photo editing and sharing app announced in february that they had 100 million active users , only two and a half years after first launching .			0
