it is a glimpse of the future of racing cars - where lasers are used instead of combustion engines , and the only cockpit displays are beamed onto the driver 's helmet			1
@entity8 says the @entity9 ( @entity11 ) concept was developed for the @entity13 racing game , @entity12 6 - but the firm has now built a real model of it , unveiled today at the @entity16			1
it says the technology in the car could eventually make it onto roads			0
' this concept is an audacious and ambitious vision – and one that demonstrates to a new audience how @entity8 's engineering and design teams challenge norms and explore the technologies of tomorrow , ' said @entity46 , executive director of advanced design			2
' it also an ode to a unique partnership that pioneered ground - breaking technologies that are used today on the track and the street			0
' the @entity54 vgthas a unique shape and an advanced , laser - based propulsion system			1
' it was created in a no - rules atmosphere to challenge designers and test engineers to deliver the most exhilarating sensations			0
' this is a fantasy car by design , ' said @entity64 , who oversaw the team that worked on the concept			0
' like the original @entity9 race cars decades ago , the @entity11 weaves advanced aerospace technologies into the design to help achieve its performance goals			0
' the @entity11 's concept propulsion system is inspired by technology derived from advanced work targeted at space travel and future aircraft design			1
it features a mid-mounted laser beamed - energy propulsion system , which pulses beams of light that focus in a shroud , creating shock waves that generate tremendous thrust in the lightweight race car			1

the front of the @entity92 concept car is shown during its world debut at the @entity16 with a 671 - @entity95 laser , powered by a pack of lithium - ion batteries , and an air - powered generator to provide 900 horsepower worth of thrust , the @entity11 will be capable of a 240 - mph top speed in the video game with 0 - 60 acceleration capability of 1.5 seconds			1
the propulsion system 's position in the composite chassis complements an unconventional yet highly active prone driver configuration – face down with the driver 's arms and legs splayed toward the wheels			1
in fact , the race car 's propulsion and suspension systems are built around the driver , enabling progressive strategies of active and driver - adjustable aerodynamics			2
' think of it as adapting a wing suit to a racing car , where the driver 's movements control certain aspects of the aero package , ' said @entity64			0
' in many ways , the @entity11 is like racing wing suit , with a protective fuselage for ' flying ' very low to the ground			0

the driver - enabled aerodynamics eliminate the need for large , conventional wings and other aero devices used to generate grip - enhancing downforce – an attribute that helps reduce the overall mass of the @entity11 's minimalist structure			0
only essential elements are on board , with instrumentation , for example , projected on the driver 's helmet visor			0
additionally , lightweight chassis components reduce the sprung weight of the race car , enabling the car to provide tremendous cornering grip with a relatively small footprint			0

' the @entity11 is a vision of how advanced technology may shape the look and driving experience of racing , ' said @entity64			0
' @entity9 's race cars and methods were seen as outlandish four decades ago , and with the innovative spirit still burning at @entity8 , the @entity92 concept might just be a harbinger of motorsports in the next four decades			2
' other manufacturers have developed concept race cars for the @entity211 project , but @entity8 is one of the few to transfer it from the digital world to a physical concept vehicle			2
gamers can race the @entity11 this holiday season by downloading an online update for @entity12 6 , the latest iteration of the best - selling @entity219 franchise that has sold more than 72 million copies worldwide since its 1998 debut			0

originally designed just to be played in the *computer* game - but @entity8 has now built a real model
firm says many of the technologies - *including* its laser propulsion system - could be seen in future racing cars
capable of a 240 - mph top speed in the video game with 0 - 60 acceleration capability of 1.5 seconds
