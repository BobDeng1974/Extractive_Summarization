@entity0 will have fewer days of ' extreme cold ' and will enjoy milder winters as a direct result of climate change , according to a new study			2
the new research is set to cool growing fears that the @entity8 could be gripped by more severe winters throughout the next century due to the @entity11 warming up			2
the study , conducted by dr @entity13 , a mathematics research fellow at the @entity14 , looked at the @entity11 amplification phenomenon , which shows a faster rate of warming in the @entity11 compared to the @entity17			1
extreme cold days and snowy scenes such as this in @entity20 , @entity21 , could become few and far between due to climate change , according to a new study this has been linked to a spike in the number of severe cold spells in recent years over @entity28 and @entity29			2
however , dr @entity13 examined detailed climate records to show that autumn and winter temperatures have been consistent because northerly winds and the cold days that come with them are warming more rapidly than southerly winds and the resulting warm days			1
he explained : ' @entity36 and winter days are becoming warmer on average , and less variable from day - to - day			1
' cold days tend to occur when the wind is blowing from the north , bringing @entity11 air south into the mid-latitudes			1
winter 2014 saw above average temperatures but record amounts of rainfall and heavy winds , which resulted in coastal flooding such as here in @entity51 in @entity52 ' because the @entity11 air is warming so rapidly these cold days are now less cold than they were in the past			1
' the new study , published in the journal @entity57 , also showed that the changes in climate will continue into the future , with projected future decreases in temperature variability in all seasons , except summer			0
the research was financially supported by the @entity0 @entity65			0
persistent heavy rainfall made it the wettest winter on record in most parts of the @entity0 according to the @entity70 , temperatures in winter earlier this year were well above the long - term average with a mean winter temperature of 5.2 degrees with a notable absence of frosts			0
however , they add that winter 2014 was an exceptionally stormy season , with at least 12 major winter storms affecting the @entity0 in two separate spells			0
persistent heavy rainfall also made it the wettest winter on record in @entity81 , @entity52 and @entity82 and the second wettest in @entity84			0
there was major flooding in the @entity87 , which left homes , farms , roads and businesses submerged in several feet of floodwater for almost a month .			0

research shows that northerly winds are warming meaning less cold days
@entity36 and winter days are becoming less cold on average
study says this is because of the @entity11 air is warming rapidly
predicted that warmer winter temperatures will continue into the future
