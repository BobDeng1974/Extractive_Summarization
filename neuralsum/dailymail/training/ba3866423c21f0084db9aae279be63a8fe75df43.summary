imagine turning up to a @entity1 date for the first time , only to be asked to have your photo taken as part of an art exhibition			1
@entity8 photographer @entity7 used the online dating app , which has a reputation for its ' hook - up ' culture , as an opportunity to discover the true meaning behind modern romance			1
her exhibition ' @entity17 ' - a common byline used by attractive females on @entity1 - explores the reactions of 17 dates with the 27 - year - old over two months			1
while @entity23 only exposed herself to the online dating scene two years ago - when she first moved to @entity26 and used the app as a tool to meet new people in a foreign city - she 's turned her experience to document her honest connection with her confidants			1
and she founds the results were quite surprising			0
in most cases , she developed a strong relationship with her subjects while also being asked to ' charm my sack ' by a @entity41 romantic			2
she initially used it to meet new people and also explore the new city the @entity8 photographer based in @entity26 went on 17 dates , 11 of which allowed her to take photos of them , as part of her project on modern romance the 27 - year - old first used @entity1 as a tool to meet people in a foreign city			1
while the photographer says she 's had positive experience on the online dating app , she does n't believe it would be a place where she 'd find ' the one '			1
' i initially signed up for @entity1 because i was single and i had just moved to another country so it was a chance for me to get out and see the city , ' she said			0
' i had a good experience although i know a lot of people talk about how it 's used as a sex hook up			0
but i 've personally met great people through @entity1 - some fabulous men and close friends			2
' i think it 's a useful tool to make friends and connect with people			0
but i 'm not sure whether it â€™s the right place to look for a long lasting relationship due to the immediacy of the app. i think people are less willing to put time into a relationship these days			0
' once hitting the @entity86 dating scene , @entity23 - who grew up in @entity84 - also found it was quite different from what she was used to in @entity8			1
' online dating in @entity8 is only just becoming socially acceptable whereas in @entity26 it 's the main platform to meet people , ' she said			1
' dating is also very formalised here and it 's socially accepted to be dating three or four people at a time so i think some women get frustrated with that			1
' @entity100 , a 32 - year - old videographer , who met up with @entity7 at a fashion launch and then had drinks together at a friend 's rooftop @entity105 , a 25 - year - old who works on finance , who also met up for drinks with @entity7			1
according to the photographer , she developed a strong connection with many of her subjects another subject who met @entity7 at a bar - freddie - who 's 27 - years old and works in finance			1
@entity7 says she was able to develop a level of trust with her subject who then allowed her to take their picture @entity122 who 's a 26 - year - old and works as an illustrator			1
@entity7 met up with @entity122 at a bar			0
he is among the @entity41 dates who allowed her to take a photo this was the inspiration behind her body of work quite aptly named @entity17 - a collection of black and white portraits from 11 of the 17 dates she had in june and july			2
' i really wanted to go out with people i genuinely wanted to date and photograph the connection i had with them , ' she said			0
from the experience , she gained 11 follow up dates and developed close friendships			2
but she also encountered the reality behind @entity1 and perhaps what constitutes as ' romance ' for some in today 's day and age			2
' @entity148 hit me up for sex right away but i think through the conversation - before you meet the person - you 're able to tell if the person has an agenda , ' @entity23 said			0
' it really depends on what you 're looking for			0
if it 's purely appearance based then i think you 'll have an infavourable experience			0
' @entity23 says this also comes to the changing notion of dating which she thinks is now seen as a game			0
' our idea of romance has changed from the traditional mind set we 've had in the past , ' she said			0
' many people see @entity1 as a game and i think that while dating life has gone digital it too has turned into a game			2
' a man named @entity148 who asked @entity7 to ' charm my sack ' during their chat on @entity1			2
the photographer was n't impressed with his pick up line @entity181 , 22 , who 's a translator			0
she and @entity7 enjoyed people watching during their date			0

she says online dating is more socially accepted in @entity86 than @entity8 @entity199 , 33 , who works in finance and real estate development			1
he met @entity7 for brunch			0
she says dates in @entity86 are ' very formalised ' @entity204 , a 26 - year - old who works in finance , went for drinks with @entity7			1
she says a lot of her @entity1 dates turned up to her art exhibition and were proud to be part of it @entity212 , a 32 - year - old musician , who took @entity7 out for dinner			1
she was very surprised by the open - mindedness of most of her dates @entity216 , a 24 - year - old law student , who had drinks with @entity7 at a bar			1
she hope to further develop her project by interviewing her tinder dates @entity23 says some subjects made it clear that they were uncomfortable with the idea of having their picture taken - some accusing of being a ' predator ' or ' pervert ' - but others were surprisingly open - minded			2
most even attended her exhibition in august - her first art exhibition in @entity26			2
' i was really nervous because it was so personal and i was opening myself up to people , ' she said			0
' but i had such an overwhelming response from the 400 people who showed up and even my dates came by and were proud to be part of exhibition			0
' while she hopes to further develop her project and continue interviewing her subjects , @entity23 has decided to take a break from the online dating scene after suffering from what she calls a ' @entity243 '			2
i was totally burnt out emotionally and physically , ' she said			0
as for finding ' the one ' - she has n't quite achieved that through the project but says she is currently dating someone who met through - you guessed it - @entity1 .			0
