@entity1 and captain @entity2 face a frustrating challenge to win back their @entity5 places despite returning this week from long - term injuries , boss @entity0 has warned			1
@entity1 played 60 minutes in a practice match against @entity8 at @entity10 training ground on wednesday lunchtime - his first appearance for the club since he injured his ankle ligaments on the club ’s pre-season tour to @entity17			1
the club ’s £ 15m record - signing , whose time at @entity20 has been plagued by injuries , may start on the bench for the visit of @entity23 this weekend , but is expected to be back to full fitness at the end of this month			2
@entity1 has not played yet this season , and will have to wait his turn as others have found form new signings @entity30 and @entity32 have both been scoring goals in @entity1 's absence however @entity0 has now stressed that given the @entity5 ’ outstanding start to the @entity36 , he can not promise his otherwise tried - and - trusted lieutenants , many of whom played in the club ’s promotion - winning season of 2011 - 12 , that they will get much game time this campaign			1
@entity0 said : ‘ everybody faces a challenge ( to start ) compared to last season because of the strength - in - depth of the squad			1
our squad has proven to be strong until now			2
‘ even my trusted captain , @entity2 , has found it difficult to break his way into the side and is extremely frustrated – as are a few of the sides			0
‘ @entity58 , having returned from injury , is another player frustrated			1
so , too , @entity60 and @entity61			0
these were my regular players last season			0
because the other players have done so well while they have been away , it has been difficult for me to put ( the regulars ) back in based on our performances and results			2
@entity0 says he has to manage the disappointment of players who are used to being regulars @entity2 ( right ) has not been able to get a regular spot in the team , despite being @entity0 's captain ‘ ( @entity1 ’s availability ) depends on how he feels when he gets in and trains tomorrow			1
that will be the deciding factor if he gets into the squad or not			0
certainly , if he continues the way he is , then if not this weekend but by the end of the international break , he should be okay and ready to join the squad			0
‘ i have to manage any disappointment			1
i have to look at the individuals and make sure they stay focused and concentrated			0
the dynamic can change in a split - second and if players on the sidelines are not mentally or physically ready to step back into the team , then we all suffer			0
my responsibility is to keep the group focused and eager to wait for that opportunity to come			0
’ summer signings like @entity96 mean that @entity5 's squad is now stronger than ever , says @entity0 @entity99 scores against @entity100 as @entity5 fought back from behind to keep up their good league form @entity102 international @entity30 , scorer of seven goals in eight matches this season , is expected to be fit for the @entity23 match at @entity20 despite hurting his shoulder in the 2 - 1 victory over champions @entity109 on october 25			1
@entity0 added : ‘ @entity30 is training today for the first time			1
he is going to train , but it will be light training			0
@entity112 came off injured so we will wait and see how his injury is this morning			2
' we will wait and see and the final decision will be made tomorrow on who is available for selection			0

@entity5 are fifth in the @entity36
@entity1 has not played since pre-season tour injury
@entity1 now fit to return , but may not regain his place up front
@entity0 *admits* he has to manage former regulars ' disappointment
