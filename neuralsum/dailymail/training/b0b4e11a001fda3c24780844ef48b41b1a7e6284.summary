it ’s painful and humiliating to admit to myself , let alone the whole world , but i pictured myself as a child in the image or video			0
the more an image mirrored some element of my memories and took me back , the more i felt a connection			0
this is my deepest , darkest secret			1
as a child i did n’t understand what had happened at the time of the abuse			1
i did know that i must not tell anyone , ever			0
later the memories took on new and more troubling meaning when i became a teenager			0
they started to appear more often and made me feel increasingly apart from everyone else			0
in my mind i instigated and enjoyed the abuse – even as a five and nine year old – no matter the age difference			1
discussing what had happened would have meant shame and blame			0
in my life , i had only ever mentioned the abuse to three friends , and then fleetingly so			0
i never spoke to a mental health professional about this or any other matter until i was in the @entity234 jail			0
i talked with a counselor there about my crime and the horrible hurt i had caused so many people			0
i did n’t talk to him about my past			0
i did n’t think it mattered because i intended to kill myself as soon as @entity243 some ways i feel disgusting sharing this truth with you because in my heart i still struggle to see my five - year - old self as a victim			0
but i ’m sharing this with you because it is the truth , not an excuse			0
and i believe it played a role in my @entity257 my family , friends and @entity260 colleagues : i ’ve had individual conversations with each of you in my mind			0
i ’ve pictured your face as i admitted to my failure and heard the shock and disappointment in your voice			0
i lay awake at night reviewing these conversations over and over again			0
they are among the most excruciatingly painful aspects of this terrible , terrible @entity272 last , to the children in the images : i should have known better			0
i perpetuated your abuse and that will be a burden on my soul for the rest of my life			0
