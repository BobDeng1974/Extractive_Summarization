the incredible footage was captured by a tiny camera strapped on to the body of one of his comrades			0
the @entity13 serviceman was patrolling muddy terrain in @entity15 when the bullet struck him			1
scroll down to watch video bravery : the marine lies on the ground , his face contorted with agony , after being shot in the neck in the short clip he falls to the ground and lays on his back in a ditch			1
he can be seen clutching his right shoulder in pain with the mud behind turning a dark shade of red as blood trickles out of his wound			0
when a fellow marine comes to his rescue , he struggles to remove his body armour so grabs a knife and cuts through the straps			1
agony : a red stain of blood , left , can be seen seeping through his combat reliefs on his shoulder immediately after he is shot			0
he then falls to the ground in a ditch as another soldier applies pressure to the wound medical treatment : a medic approaches the stricken marine from behind as he lays on the ground and rips open surgical gauze as another soldier applies pressure to the wound a medic then approaches the stricken marine from behind as he lays on the ground and rips open a pack of surgical gauze as another soldier applies pressure to the wound to stem the blood flow			1
he then kneels down in the muddy water and cuts off the rest of the wounded soldier 's combat fatigues			2
by this point the marine 's helmet and googles have been removed and his face contorts in agony as he is helped			2
determined : the marine , left , runs to the safety of the awaiting helicopter safety : after getting on the aircraft , the person who has the camera on their head , gives him a thumbs up and the helicopter can be seen flying away the bandage is wrapped around his shoulder and he is sat up by the medic , although he is starting to look visibly paler due to the blood loss			2
but amazingly he is then shown running across the ground to an awaiting helicopter , with a small dog bounding ahead			0
