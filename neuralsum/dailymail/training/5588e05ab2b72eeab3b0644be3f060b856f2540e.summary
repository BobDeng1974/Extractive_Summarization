@entity1 skewered @entity2 before the live tv debate even started , by telling his rival to pretend they liked each other as the cameras rolled , it emerged today			1
mr @entity1 made the gibe as they shook hands at the beginning of the showdown , which saw mr @entity2 hammered over his currency plans if @entity15 back independence in next month 's referendum			1
the @entity18 campaign said it was proof mr @entity1 was calling the shots , as mr @entity2 was forced to desperately insist : ' it 's @entity15 's pound and we are keeping it			1
microphones which were left on as the two men shook hands for the cameras before the debate picked up how mr @entity1 planned to dominate the clash			2
as they were applauded by the audience , he was heard to tell mr @entity2 : ' pretend we 're pleased to see each other , ' @entity39 reported			1
one of the biggest threats to the @entity45 campaign has been growing doubts about the currency an independent @entity15 would use			2
after ditching the idea of adopting the euro , the @entity48 has claimed it would enter a currency union with the @entity52 and continue to use the pound			2
however the @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 have all made clear they would block a deal , whoever wins the next general election			2
mr @entity1 hammered his rival over his plans for a currency if @entity15 back independence in next month 's referendum during the tv debate , mr @entity1 drew huge applause when he told mr @entity2 : ' any eight - year - old can tell you the flag of a country , the capital of a country and its currency			1
' i presume the flag is the @entity76 , i assume our capital will still be @entity79 , but you ca n't tell us what currency we will have			0
what is an eight - year - old going to make of that ? ' yesterday mr @entity2 resorted to playground tactics as his currency plans for a separate @entity15 fell into chaos			1
labour leader @entity87 today insisted he would block any currency union between an independent @entity15 and the rest of the @entity52 he said the rest of the @entity52 would have to accept a deal because it would be the ' sovereign will ' of the people of @entity15 following a @entity45 vote – ignoring the views of those in @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97			0
but in a speech today @entity56 leader @entity87 insisted he would veto a currency union if he becomes prime minister after next year 's general election			0
he warned the risks to the @entity52 of sharing the pound with an independent @entity104 would outweigh the benefits of cutting the @entity52 national debt or preventing cross-border transaction costs			0
@entity15 's share of the @entity52 debt would amount to about £ 120 billion - around £ 5 billion a year in repayments			0
but the @entity111 has threatened to withhold its share if the @entity52 does not agree to share the pound			0
speaking after an address to the @entity15 @entity114 in @entity115 , mr @entity87 said : ' of course you want to avoid the transaction costs , which is one of the reasons we want the @entity52 to stay together			0
' but i 'm afraid the cost of a currency union without political union , without a fiscal union , without banking union , are costs that will be too high for the @entity52			0
' but @entity15 financial secretary @entity127 told @entity104 , said : ' the position will crumble after a @entity45 vote in the referendum because what mr @entity87 or mr @entity132 or mr @entity133 or whoever is leading the @entity52 after the 2015 election would have to do would be they would have to say to the rest of the @entity52 ' look , we 're going to put a barrier up for your trade with @entity15 which would increase the cost for business in the rest of the @entity52 by £ 500 million , we 're going to undermine sterling by rejecting the contribution made by oil and gas and whisky into a sterling area , and we 're also going to absolve the @entity15 of a gbp120 billion share of the @entity52 debt which translates into an annual cost of gbp5 billion a year , simply because we wo n't agree to a currency union ' .			1
