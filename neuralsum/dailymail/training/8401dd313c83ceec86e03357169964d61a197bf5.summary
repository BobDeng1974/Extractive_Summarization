by @entity0 the father of one of the girls gang - raped and hanged from a tree says he was ridiculed by police when he reported her missing			1
the man , who has not been identified , said that because he was from a lower caste , police officers ' refused to look for my girl ' the girls , cousins aged 14 and 16 , were found hanging from a mango tree in @entity16 village in @entity17 after they were raped and killed by a gang			1
the case has once again shone the spotlight on @entity22 's attitude to gang rape			1
now the father of one of the girls has said that because of his low rank in the caste system , police ignored him when he went for help			1
the family belongs to the @entity43 community , also called ' untouchables ' and considered the lowest rung in @entity22 's age - old caste system			1
' when i went to the police station , the first thing i was asked was my caste , ' he told the @entity51			2
' when i told them what my caste was , they started abusing me			2
' shock and anger : members of @entity58 shout slogans during a protest against the gang rape @entity62 : the family belongs to the @entity43 community , also called ' untouchables ' and considered the lowest rung in @entity22 's age - old caste system at least three men , including one policeman , have been arrested in connection with the crime			1
officials are searching for another three men , one of whom is also a police officer			1
@entity22 tightened its anti-rape laws last year , making gang rape punishable by the death penalty , even in cases where the victim survives			1
the new laws came after the fatal gang rape in 2012 of a 23 - year - old woman on a moving bus in @entity84 that triggered nationwide protests			0
the woman , a 23 - year - old intern , was attacked while riding a bus through the capital on 16 december 2012			0
she was set upon by a gang of six men - one of whom was under 18			0
a court heard the woman was seized by the men , raped repeatedly and given horrific injuries after they had beaten a male friend who was with her with an iron bar , throwing him to the back of the bus			2
the men were said to have been drinking heavily beforehand			0
details were also given of the horrific internal injuries the woman suffered - which were held up as proof they wanted to kill as well as rape her			0
she died in hospital on 29 december			0
@entity123 , 33 , @entity124 , 27 , @entity125 , 21 , @entity126 , 28 , and @entity127 , 20 , were arrested for the crime			0
the youth was not named			0
the six accused were taken into custody after the attack			0
@entity123 hanged himself in prison , and the rest were found guilty of kidnap , rape , robbery and murder			2
the youth was given the maximum possible sentence of three years , while the remaining four men were given death sentences			0
rape remains a huge problem in @entity22 , and reports of the crime have been on the rise since the horrific incident on the bus			1
from january to october 2013 , 1,330 rapes were reported in @entity84 and its suburbs , compared with 706 for all of 2012 , according to government figures			0
in the wake of the incident the @entity22 government opened 73 ' fast - track ' courts in the hope of speeding up the rate at which rapes could be processed			2
it was planned that eventually 1,800 such courts would exist , and spend three years working through the backlog			0
however , conviction rates remain low			0
of the 706 rapes reported in 2012 in @entity84 , only the most shocking and famous incident resulted in any convictions			0
these are among 1,800 fast - track courts the authorities plan to set up and run for three years , focusing on violent crimes and other serious offences against women , children and the elderly , as part of broader judicial reforms , the report said			0
following the latest incident , it emerged today that the mother of a victim was stripped in the street and beaten by the accused 's father for refusing to drop the case against his son			1
the woman was set upon by @entity188 and four accomplices on monday in @entity190 , @entity17			2
two weeks earlier , @entity188 's son , @entity191 , was arrested for allegedly breaking into the woman 's house and raping her daughter			1
the victim 's mother has since led a campaign to have @entity191 charged with the crime despite sustained pressure from his family to drop the case			1
she is now lying in critical condition in hospital , rendered completely speechless since the attack			0
still , no arrests have been made			2
@entity22 's government continues to face fierce criticism over its handling of such cases and inability to eradicate sexual attacks on women and children			1
and in a further horrifying case , the owner and manager of a children 's boarding school in western @entity22 were arrested after five minors said they were raped , forced to watch pornographic films and act them out with one another			1
the children were made to eat faeces as a punishment if they did not comply			2
the 52 - year - old owner of the @entity224 and his 30 - year - old female manager were arrested on monday after a police raid on the school in @entity228 in @entity230 state			1
' we received a police complaint from the @entity234 charity saying that one child had gone home for the holidays and confessed to his mother that abuses were happening , ' @entity240 's police inspector @entity239 told the @entity242 late on thursday			1
' five children in total have now come forward and we have booked the two suspects under various offences , ' he said , adding that these included unnatural sex ( sodomy ) , wrongful confinement and sexual assault			2
inspection mechanisms for children 's homes , shelters and schools are inadequate and many privately run facilities are not even registered , a february 2013 report by @entity259 said			1
records show a rape is committed every 22 minutes in @entity22 , a nation of 1.2 billion people			1
activists say that number is low because of an entrenched culture of tolerance for sexual violence , which leads many cases to go unreported			0
women are often pressed by family or police to stay quiet about sexual assault , experts say , and those who do report cases are often subjected to public ridicule or social stigma			0
last month , the head of @entity17 state 's governing party , the regionally prominent @entity278 , told an election rally that the party was opposed to the law calling for gang rapists to be executed			2
' boys will be boys , ' @entity284 said			0
