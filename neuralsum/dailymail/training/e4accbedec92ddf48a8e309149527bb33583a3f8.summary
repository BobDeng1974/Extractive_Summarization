a postman later opened the postbox to find the cigarette packet - sized device , which had a 12 - volt battery and two wires protruding from it - each one attached to a nail			2
the discovery triggered a mass evacuation of the immediate area and a 100 - metre cordon being placed around the scene , while bomb disposal experts were called to make the device safe			2
if the two nails had touched , an electrical circuit would have been completed - prompting an intense fire which could have injured the postman			2

during the trial , @entity4 said : ' it could range from three to four letters a week to 30 a day , more than that			2
i did go down to the depot , but they said they are not allowed to hold onto any mail			0
however , the court was told @entity4 became ' obsessive ' about his mail and would constantly carry a voice recorder in his pocket so he could record every conversation he had with postal workers during complaints			2
later , he researched the postmen on @entity126 and the electoral role in an attempt to find out where they lived			0
making the area safe : police stand guard in a street close to where @entity4 's bomb was discovered in november 2010 , police spoke to @entity4 about him harassing @entity14 workers - causing him to reply : ' i 'm not going to send a bomb in the mail or anything '			1
the following april , the homemade bomb was found by postman @entity143 as he emptied the postbox outside @entity146 post office			1
@entity147 , prosecuting , said : ' he had a long - standing grudge towards employees of the @entity14			0
this grudge caused him to harass postal workers in a variety of ways but that conduct turned quite sinister			0
' police raided @entity4 's home in september 2012 and discovered a pen drive containing a folder entitled ' dangerous '			2
it comprised hundreds of pages including an article containing a diagram and instructions on how to make a pipe bomb from a 2010 issue of the terrorist publication ' @entity167 '			0
another folder provided details of how to handle chemicals , the methods used to make explosives and how to avoid detection			0
officers also found handwriting and scribbles with legible words and phrases related to creating explosive devices , such as ' gunpowder , ' ' flash paper ' and ' big boom			0
' they later discovered 533 indecent images of children and internet searches for mocked - up ' psuedo ' nude images of @entity189 actress @entity188			0
forensic analysis of @entity4 's dna found 13 matches on the bomb			1
he had also posted videos on how to make a pipe bomb and the mechanics of an electronic fly zapper on @entity198			0
however , when questioned , @entity4 denied any wrongdoing and claimed he had been ' experimenting ' with chemicals at home			0
he added that he had even ' blown himself up ' twice during his bizarre experiments			0
speaking outside court , detective @entity203 , of the @entity204 , said : ' @entity4 waged a one - man crusade against the post office , a one - sided conflict that seems to have been ignited by the tiniest of sparks			1
' a perceived problem with mail going to the wrong house was all it took for @entity4 to launch an escalating vendetta which involved sexual slurs and sending a letter bomb to a post office			1
' had this crude device gone off , then the unfortunate postal worker who opened it could have suffered very serious injuries			0
' you do not need a vivid imagination to foresee the kind of damage that razor blades and fish hooks could have caused to a human being			1
' one of his most damaging actions was to post indecent images of children and babies to local primary schools , with details of two postal workers on the back			0
' had this information got out into the wider public , as was presumably his intention , then these completely innocent people would not only have had their careers and reputations destroyed , but they could have been subjected to vigilante attacks			0
