by @entity0 for @entity1 a new art exhibition at one of @entity5 's top galleries has been branded racist for using black actors dressed up as slaves			1
@entity10 , by @entity9 artist @entity8 , features live performers including a black man in a cage and a semi-naked woman with shackles around her neck			1
an online petition calling for the show to be axed has been signed by 6,000 people since it was launched last week			1
@entity10 , by @entity9 artist @entity8 , features a semi-naked woman with shackles around her neck a petition calling for the show to be axed has been signed by 6,000 people since it was launched last week community activists are also drawing up plans for a demonstration over @entity10 outside the @entity25			1
it is set to take place at the @entity25 between september 23 and 27 - and those at the art centre have defended the exhibition , despite the accusations of racism			1
already seen in various @entity35 capitals , the work has attracted criticism , particularly in @entity37 , where it caused fury among anti-racism campaigners , who questioned the authority of a white director to tackle the story of black exploitation			1
the controversial show most recently ran in @entity46 until august 25			2
mr @entity8 's inspiration is the 19th century phenomenon of the human zoo , by which people of colour were displayed as museum objects to white @entity35 and @entity53			1
the artist has recruited a number of people of @entity9 and @entity58 origin and arranged them as living sculptures that offer a painful reminder of the appalling history of colonialism and racial hatred			2
the controversial exhibition will take place at the @entity25 from september 23 to september 27 but the exhibition has been attacked by campaigners and an online petition was organised by journalist and activist , @entity69			1
she criticised the work for the lack of respect it gave to the ancestral children of the enslaved and dehumanised			0
she said : ' i ’m calling on the @entity25 not to display it			1
' i am a black @entity9 mother from @entity78			0
i campaign and work with my community to try to breakdown the stereotypes that black people have to struggle against in society on a daily basis			2
' i want my children to grow up in a world where the barbaric things that happened to their ancestors are a thing of the past			0
' we have come a long way since the days of the grotesque human zoo - we should not be taking steps back now			0
' if @entity8 is trying to make a point about slavery this is not the way to do it			2
the irony gets lost and it ’s not long before the people behind the cage begin to feel like animals trapped in a zoo			2
' one of the actors in his piece said “ how do you know we are not entertaining people the same way the human zoos did ? ” at the beginning of the petition , she wrote : ' we wish to register our utmost disgust at what we consider to be an outrageous act of complicit racism with the @entity25 agreeing to the housing and display of this production			1
' @entity121 @entity8 claims his human zoo vanity project is “ art ” ; just how are we as @entity124 's supposed to respond to this ? ' this is simply an exercise in white racial privilege			2
if it is n’t , then perhaps @entity8 can explain why he did n't use white people in his zoo ? ' after all , would n't him doing so be both more striking and send a clearer message ? ' mr @entity8 's inspiration is the 19th century phenomenon of the human zoo , by which people of colour were displayed as museum objects to white @entity35 and @entity53 activist @entity69 criticised the work for the lack of respect it gave to the ancestral children of the enslaved @entity142 , co-founder of @entity143 , said : ' we do n't believe that in order to remind people of the horrors of racism , enslavement , apartheid and colonial rule it is necessary to place black people in cages and put them on display in an exhibition			1
' this exhibition does nothing to promote race equality			0
' but mr @entity8 , a white man who grew up in apartheid @entity9 , believes that his piece is thought - provoking			1
he said : ' @entity10 is not a piece about black histories made for white audiences			0
' it is a piece about humanity ; about a system of dehumanisation that affects everybody within society , regardless of skin colour , ethnic or cultural background , that scours the humanity from the " looker " and the " looked at			0
" ' and he was defended by the @entity25 's @entity175 , @entity176			2
he said : ' we appreciate that the work tackles controversial and sensitive issues			0
' however i ’d like to assure you that @entity10 aims to subvert and challenge racial or cultural @entity182 , not to reinforce it			0
' @entity10 involves performers demonstrating the brutal reality behind colonisation accompanied by text that reveals the historical context of each scenario			0
' the piece aims to explore the relationship between @entity193 powers and @entity9 , ranging from exposing the abhorrent historical attitudes to race during the colonial era to questioning how far our society has moved on , by holding up a mirror to contemporary issues such as the current treatment of immigrants and asylum seekers			0
' it provokes audiences to reflect on the historical roots of today ’s prejudices and policies and how these have been shaped over centuries			0
' previous performances of @entity10 , such as in @entity210 , @entity211 and most recently @entity46 , have attracted a diverse and politically engaged audience and it has been seen as a watershed work that provokes discussion about racism and the historical roots of prejudices			0

exhibit b , by artist @entity8 , has been branded racist by campaigners
it features a black man in a cage and a semi-naked woman in shackles
a petition calling for the show to be axed has been signed by 6,000 people
