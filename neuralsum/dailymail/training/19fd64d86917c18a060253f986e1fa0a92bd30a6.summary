by @entity0 shoppers have been using foreign coins instead of £ 2 coins in some self - service tills in @entity5 a supermarket is refusing to let shoppers pay with £ 2 coins at self - service tills after discovering that people were paying with similar - sized foreign coins			1
bosses at @entity5 say a steep rise in the numbers of shoppers paying with coins from overseas meant they have had to refuse to accept £ 2 coins at automated check - outs at some of their stores in the @entity21 until they can fix the technology			1
they say the most common offenders are @entity25 250 rial coins , and @entity27 ten bath pieces			2
a spokesman for the supermarket chain said : ' a number of stores have had foreign currency passed off as £ 2 coins at self - checkouts			1
' while we fix the issue , we have temporarily stopped them accepting any £ 2 coins , although customers are still free to use them at all manned checkouts			2
' we apologise for any inconvenience it is causing , but do n’t expect the fix to take long			0
' a spokesman for coin experts , @entity45 , said : ' the key with these machines is weight and diameter			0
a £ 2 coin weighs 12 grammes			1
' it may well be that shoppers are not looking to rip anyone off - in some cases , there is very little difference in currency value			0
' they may simply be trying to use change they gathered while holidaying abroad			0
' it was long believed £ 2 coins would be too expensive to copy because they are made from two different metal alloys			1
but last june police found a counterfeit press , producing fake £ 1 and £ 2 coins , in an @entity68 warehouse			2
the lead coins , dubbed crude copies , looked legitimate as they had been sprayed silver and gold , but would not be accepted in vending machines because they were magnetic			0
a @entity5 spokesman would n't be more specific but said a ' number of stores in the @entity21 ' were affected offenders : the @entity25 250 rial coin , left , and the @entity27 ten baht coin , right , are commonly used , @entity5 say the supermarket is now looking to refine its tills ' technology so that only the right coins will be accepted a spokesman for online coin dealer , 24carat.co.uk said : ' we do n’t yet fully understand why counterfeiters would be turning to forging £ 2 coins when we would have thought it would be easier and more worthwhile to focus on £ 1 coins			1
' the only reason we can think of is that it is becoming more widely known that many fake pound coins are in circulation , making them subject to greater scrutiny			0

shoppers are using @entity25 rial coins and @entity27 baht instead at automated tills
supermarket saw rise in people using the *wrong* coins in the @entity21
@entity5 *banned* some stores ' self - service tills taking £ 2 coins til they fix it
tills judge coins on their diameter and weight - a £ 2 coin weighs 12 grammes
£ 2 coins are *notoriously* hard to counterfeit as they are made of two alloys
