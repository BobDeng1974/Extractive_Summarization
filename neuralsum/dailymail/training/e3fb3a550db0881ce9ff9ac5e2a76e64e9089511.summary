by @entity0 published : 17:30 est , 24 january 2014 updated : 17:35 est , 24 january 2014 i step away from my team - mates on the halfway line and head towards the goal			1
making his way from the left is @entity10 , @entity11 ‘ s goalkeeper			1
i do n’t see him			2
i do n’t see anything			2
not one of the best keepers in the world circa 2002			2
not the 70,000 in the @entity17 , although the scene behind the goal is a blur of green			2
i just want to know where the ball is			2
pressure : @entity0 hangs his head after missing a decisive penalty against @entity11 at the 2002 @entity26 step up : @entity0 celebrates after scoring his next penalty in @entity29 's 3 - 0 win over @entity30 in my mind i go through the penalty kick to beat @entity10 and get us to the quarter - finals			1
i try to get it all out of my head			2
from the day we joined up for the @entity26 in @entity39 , we practised penalties after every session			1
@entity42 got some stick for saying , in his usual blunt and honest way , that he never saw the point			0
you can never replicate the pressure of the real thing			0
the competition is always fierce in training			0
believe me , i have seen penalty competitions nearly come to blows and some festering resentments			2
goalkeepers do n’t like conceding penalties			2
and especially if the penalty taker tries to take the mickey , or tries something they would never try in a game , such as the @entity63 chip			2
at the end of those sessions in @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 , i ’d usually drill the ball with power to the keeper ’s left			0
yet when it came to hitting that ball in @entity77 that night , for a place in the quarter - finals , i tried to place it and did n’t get the right connection			1
i don ’ t know why			0
but i do know @entity10 saved it			0
i do n’t think there was a lower point in my career , certainly not an occasion i felt i had let so many people down			0
the words of consolation from @entity42 , my team - mates , friends and family took a while sink in			2
brothers in arms : @entity96 missed four of five penalties as they were beaten by @entity29 in the @entity99 on the spot : @entity101 and @entity102 ( r ) were guilty of not scoring their penalties six months later , an @entity106 tie with @entity29 against @entity30 and we went to a penalty shoot - out			1
i ’d never shirked one before and i made sure i took one , going second after @entity110			0
and i made sure i scored , striking the ball cleanly , powerfully , to @entity113 ’s left			2
we won 3 - 0			2
that helped bury the memory of @entity70 for me			0
and the players who missed in the @entity99 semi-final at @entity118 on wednesday must step up again the next time they are in a penalty shoot - out			1
if ever an occasion proved that the pressure of penalties gets to players it was surely on wednesday night			1
ten penalties , only three scored , and players who you would expect to bury the ball in the back of the net , missed			1
when @entity133 stepped up as @entity29 ’s first penalty taker it made complete sense			1
he can strike a ball , he has arguably the best technique in the @entity29 team , which is why he takes free - kicks and he is a confident player at set pieces			1
and he put his shot over the bar			0
@entity143 , a striker who hits the ball sweetly normally , barely managed to hit the goal - line			2
@entity101 and @entity146 missed the target and @entity102 , arguably the one @entity148 player who has played with real confidence all season for one so young , hit a weak penalty that @entity152 saved easily			1
howler : @entity154 received plenty of stick for his badly missed penalty in @entity159 's game against @entity160 one other player who has had to come to terms with the pain of missing a vital penalty is @entity159 striker @entity154 , who found his own way to get over the disappointment last week			1
his penalty against @entity160 was one of the worst the @entity169 has seen and understandably some people were quick to take the mickey out of him			1
and that ’s inevitable when you hit one as wildly as he did a fortnight ago			0
pundits , ex-players and even his former manager @entity177 had a go at him , and i can understand why he was upset at the attention he got for a few days			0
on reflection , he would be laughing himself if he had seen someone else take such a wild and poor a penalty			2
although palace manager @entity184 was upset immediately afterwards , he stood by @entity154 , who is a very talented player			1
there was never any doubt about him playing @entity184 ’ former team @entity187 last week			0
and @entity154 backed his faith by scoring the winner			1
the aftermath of that penalty miss was obviously not particularly nice for @entity154			1
many of us saw his reaction on @entity195 , and he did bite to the criticism and the ‘ jokes ’			0
@entity198 always used to tell us that it takes courage to step over that white line because you are vulnerable , especially when things go wrong			0
but it is still the best way of answering the critics			0
red tape : @entity208 have been fined £ 20,000 because @entity209 does n't carry a coaching license @entity209 and @entity208 should be receiving all the help they can get as they try to stay in the @entity214			1
instead they get a £ 20,000 fine from the very same organisation because my former @entity219 team - mate did n’t have the correct coaching qualifications			1
rules are rules , and no manager in @entity224 or @entity225 can work without their @entity227 licence , i understand that			0
but seriously , what purpose does it serve fining a cash - strapped club like @entity208 ? this is a club who @entity209 helped bail out in the summer by financing a club debt			1
surely that loyalty should be recognised too			0
and he is not just a @entity238 manager who has been handed the reins by @entity208			0
@entity209 is a former @entity67 international and @entity169 player who is now trying to make a living at a very difficult level and at a club who have to watch every penny			1
he also has @entity246 alongside him , who is qualified , and vastly experienced and know what he ’s doing			0
sir @entity250 managed to manage without the pro-licence , and it did n’t seem to do the new @entity227 coaching ambassador any harm			2
unqualified success : new @entity227 coaching ambassador @entity250 , pictured with @entity256 ( r ) , never held a pro license i know the game has changed , and the @entity106 and @entity214 want to ensure ex-players are properly qualified , but they do n’t exactly make it easy for players to get their coaching qualifications			1
although the @entity106 are now running courses during the season , only a small percentage are enrolling			1
when i was a player – and i now have my a licence and will be completing the pro-licence this summer – courses were run over a four to six week period during the close season			0
but that ’s a time when the last thing some players want to do is spend more time playing or learning about football			1
sometimes they need a complete break from the game			0
and if they do n’t their families do			0
before i retired , i was asked to speak to a club about a vacancy but i could n’t even go for the interview because i did n’t have my pro-licence			0
and yet i know having that qualification would have made absolutely no difference if i ’d taken the job , and not having it would not have hindered me			0
endurance test : @entity208 are struggling to stay in the @entity214 part of the @entity214 fine was suspended provided @entity209 gets his b licence			1
and he now has it			0
but far more important than that certificate is the experience he will gain in one of the most difficult jobs in the country , in one of the most precarious divisions in the world			0
longevity is not exactly a word you hear often round the @entity225 clubs is it ? it has not been an easy first season , in fact they looked doomed after a couple of months , but he has turned things round and got some good results and given himself and @entity208 a chance of staying in the @entity214			0
and i just think he deserved a bit more help and understanding from the authorities to do that			0
@entity29 supporters just desserts : @entity29 's long suffering fans deserve a date at @entity324 under @entity325 it ’s an amazing achievement for @entity325 to get @entity29 to the @entity327 – beating @entity148 , @entity328 and @entity329 on the way			1
no one could have predicted that when he took over in such tough circumstances			0
and i am so pleased for @entity29 ’s long - suffering fans			1
the noise and atmosphere they created at @entity118 was brilliant and i hope they can enjoy their day out at @entity324			1
@entity339 there is no place in football for politics , racism , homophobia , anti-semitism or any form discrimination			1
sign language : @entity339 faces a lengthy ban following his ill - advised ' quenelle ' gesture			1

@entity0 missed a penalty for @entity355 against @entity11 the 2002 @entity26
only three players from 10 scored penalties in the @entity99 semi-final
@entity154 was *ridiculed* for his penalty miss against @entity160
@entity106 decision to fine @entity209 for not having a coaching license is *unfair*
long - suffering @entity29 fans deserve a date at @entity324
there is no place in football for @entity339 's quenelle gesture
