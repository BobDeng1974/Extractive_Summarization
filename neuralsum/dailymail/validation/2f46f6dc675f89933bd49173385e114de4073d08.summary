it sounds like a scene from a science fiction film but if one food concept designer has her way this is how everybody will be eating in the near future			1
while @entity12 food - printing technology is not a new thing , the invention of this self - growing snack that makes its own filling could change the way we consume food , forever			1
the @entity18 project is the brainchild of @entity21 concept designer @entity20 who conceived of the idea to show that high - tech or lab - produced food does not have to be ' unhealthy and unnatural			1
on her website ms @entity20 explained in a video : ' the @entity42 is about creating a fully edible ecosystem with living organisms in which the base gets printed by a 3d - printer and gradually develops towards a fully - fledged dish			1
' multiple layers containing seeds , spores and yeast are printed according to a personalized @entity12 file			0
within five days the plants and fungi mature and the yeast ferments the solid inside into a liquid			2
the product ’s intensifying structure , scent and taste are reflected in its changing appearance			0
depending on the preferred intensity , the consumer decides when to harvest and enjoy the delicious , fresh and nutrient - rich edible			2
according to ms @entity20 , the project is an example of high - tech but fully natural , healthy , and sustainable food made possible by combining aspects of nature , science , technology and design			1
@entity18 makes use of natural processes like fermentation and photosynthesis and lowers the use of resources			1
she explained : ' it shows that high tech food does n't have to be unhealthy or unnatural , but that it can actually have a lot of advantages			1
' the printer is not only used as a kind of shaping machine in which material a gets in and also comes out in another shape but it is used to create innovative food that truly contributes to solving the world 's food problems			0
' the snack in its various stages : 3d - printed nylon prototype ( left ) and growth test to see if it will take ( right ) success : the inner workings of the @entity18 prototype which shows mushrooms and sprouts the food designer aims to use the new food technology to create natural , healthy , sustainable and nutrient rich food that can not be made with traditional production methods			1
' with @entity18 a lot of unnecessary stages of the food chain disappear with as result a reduction of food waste , food miles and co2 emission			2
at the same time the consumer will become more involved and conscious about the food they eat , ' she continued			0
the product is built from several layers , with an outer shell of crust made of dough or pasta , and on the inside spores , seeds , yeast and edible soiled are contained			0
a new way of eating : from machine to mouth in five days			0
the food designer hopes her concept will change the way we view and consume food in the future the new food technology will create natural , healthy , sustainable , and nutrient rich food that can not be made using traditional production methods after it has been printed , the consumer takes it home and within three to five days , it will develop into a complete dish that contains all the nutrients a the body needs			1
she compares the process to the maturing of cheese			2
' just like @entity147 , the intensity of its taste , smell and whole eating experience increases over time			0
' if we could produce our food this way , you can imagine that the food supply chain would shrink immensely , ' she said			0
the project is still at a conceptual stage at this point			0
' apart from the necessary technological development , a lot of biotechnological research will be needed on the composition of ingredients and food safety for instance , ' she said			0
' right now @entity18 is really a future food concept , that inspires scientists , designers , and cooks to think about the future of our food			2

the @entity18 project brainchild food designer @entity20
high - tech but fully natural food combines nature , science and technology
similar to maturing of cheese , flavours will intensify in three to five days
