by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 in @entity3 a public inquiry is to be held into the death of poisoned ex-russian spy @entity6			1
with tensions running high with @entity3 over the downing of a @entity12 flight over @entity13 , the @entity8 government has given the go - ahead to a probe into whether the @entity17 state was behind mr @entity6 ’s murder			1
the former @entity20 officer died in 2006 after drinking tea laced with radioactive polonium - 210 with two ex-colleagues at a @entity25 hotel			1
his widow @entity26 said the move sent a powerful ' message to his murderers ' , but one @entity17 mp claimed it was driven entirely by ' political expediency '			2
she insisted in july 2013 that an inquest led by a coroner was ‘ more readily explainable to some of our foreign partners ’			2
twelve months on , and following a legal defeat , the government has said an inquiry will start by july 31			0
relations between @entity8 and @entity17 are now in the deep freeze , with @entity50 threatening ‘ hard - hitting economic sanctions against @entity17 ’ over the shooting down of flight @entity52 , killing all 298 people on board			1
the prime minister insists the evidence is pointing in ‘ one direction ’ – that the plane was hit by an sa - 11 missile since smuggled back across the border into @entity17			2
@entity64 foreign ministers will today meet to discuss tougher sanctions against @entity17 for fuelling the conflict in eastern @entity13			2
in a written statement to @entity69 , mrs may said she had now agreed to establish an inquiry and has written to justice secretary @entity72 asking him to halt the inquest			2
coroner sir @entity74 , who had warned a public inquiry was needed because he could not consider vital secret evidence as part of a normal inquest , is to lead the inquiry			1
mrs may added : ' i am very grateful to sir @entity74 for continuing to lead the independent judicial investigation into mr @entity6 ’s death			1
' it is more than seven years since mr @entity6 ’s death , and i very much hope that this inquiry will be of some comfort to his widow mrs @entity6			2
' the decision to press ahead with a public inquiry into mr @entity6 ’s death will further pile pressure on @entity3			1
under the @entity89 , sir @entity74 will have the power to demand the production of witnesses and papers within @entity8 jurisdiction , including agents and documents from the security and intelligence services			1
however , he has no such powers in relation to evidence from @entity17			0
mr @entity50 's official spokesman insisted there was ' no link whatsoever ' between the announcement of the inquiry and current tensions with @entity17 over its activities in @entity13			2
mr @entity6 's widow @entity26 said the public inquiry sent a powerful ' message to his murderers ' but @entity17 mp @entity112 today accused @entity8 of a blatant political act in launching a public inquiry into the death			1
mr @entity112 - wanted by @entity116 to face murder charges over the former @entity120 officer 's death - accused home secretary @entity36 of ' cynicism , lies , treachery , baseness			0
' this is the only way i can comment on the actions of the @entity8 establishment and the decision to hold a public inquiry into @entity6 's death			1
' the move was entirely one of ' political expediency ' , he claimed			0
@entity6 , the widow of @entity135 , won a court battle forcing home secretary @entity36 to reconsider her opposition to a public inquiry ' now due to the situation in the south - east of @entity13 , the @entity139 increases pressure on @entity17 , and personally on the head of state , @entity142			1
' @entity112 has always denied playing any role in @entity6 's death			0
@entity142 has ruled out extraditing @entity112 to face charges in @entity8 , citing a @entity17 constitutional ban			0
@entity112 - also a former secret services officer - recently called for the @entity17 intelligence agency to revert to its former name , the @entity20			0
@entity8 government officials have been in contact with the @entity153 in @entity25 before today 's announcement			0
mr @entity6 , 43 , was poisoned with radioactive polonium - 210 while drinking tea at the @entity157 in @entity25 ’s @entity158 in 2006			1
his family believes he was working for @entity160 at the time and was killed on the orders of the @entity163			0
former @entity20 bodyguard @entity112 and @entity164 have been identified as the prime suspects , but both deny any involvement and remain in @entity17			0
since his death his widow @entity169 and son @entity170 have battled to discover the truth about what led to his killing			0
today mrs @entity6 said she is ' relieved and delighted ' that a public inquiry is to be held into the death of her husband , known as @entity178 to his loved ones			1
mrs @entity6 said : ' it sends a message to @entity178 's murderers : no matter how strong and powerful you are , truth will win out in the end and you will be held accountable for your crimes			0
' it has taken nearly eight years to bring those culpable for @entity178 's murder to justice			0
i look forward to the day when the truth behind my husband 's murder is revealed for the whole world to see			0
' mrs @entity6 ’s lawyers argued a public inquiry needed to establish whether mr @entity6 was the victim of a crime committed ' for private criminal purposes ' or whether it was a ' state - sponsored assassination carried out on the territory of the @entity8 on the orders of the @entity17 government ' .			1

@entity17 spy @entity6 was poisoned in @entity25 hotel in 2006
coroner sir @entity74 asked for public inquiry instead of an inquest
last year ministers *rejected* idea , to protect ' international relations '
but after @entity52 flight was shot down , tensions with @entity17 have *mounted*
investigators will now probe whether the @entity17 state was behind murder
