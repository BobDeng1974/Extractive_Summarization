it ’s not about @entity1 by @entity2 i have always felt there is a time and a place for self - help books			1
that time is not now and the place is @entity9 , a @entity10			2
but , just occasionally , a book comes along that is not only interesting , but might — just might — be of some conceivable help to someone			2
this , i believe , is one such			2
@entity2 , an @entity17 psychologist and social scientist , and by no means the long - deceased star of @entity20 , sets out to help us ‘ solve unsolvable problems ’			1
while he does n’t , because they ’re unsolvable , he does help us solve problems that look unsolvable but are n’t — which , i suppose , is the next best thing			1
@entity27 had spent the @entity29 ' entire original budget on one prop , a mechanical shark ( stock picture ) the shark in question was the one in @entity29			2
@entity27 had spent the film ’s entire original budget on one prop , a mechanical shark which , on film , looked exactly like a mechanical shark			2
not only was it not scary , but in saltwater ‘ even its synthetic skin failed , as it became waterlogged and bloated , transforming the terrifying shark into a giant sea marshmallow ’			0
what to do ? @entity2 says that , when we have a problem , many of us are overwhelmed by it			1
‘ like staring at the sun and not being able to see the sky all around it , we stare at our problems and can not see anything else , much less a solution			0
’ @entity27 did n’t stare at his problem			1
he just asked himself , ‘ what would @entity57 do ? ’ and he realised that the answer was not to show the shark at all , if possible			1
as his star @entity68 said , with admiration : ‘ he had to invent , on the spot , another way of shooting , which was to imply the shark , which made an ordinary film into a great film			0
’ problems , of course , are everywhere			0
people ca n’t make decisions , so hamstrung are they by the fear of making the wrong decision			1
@entity2 tells the story of the sitcom @entity78 , one of two pilots made by @entity81 one summer			1
the studio audience detested it			0
@entity81 executives could see the show ’s potential , but no one had the courage to go out on a creative limb , so they instead ordered something called @entity91 , which was bland , familiar and utterly unexceptional			2
it barely lasted a year			0
in the meantime , @entity78 squeaked in through the back door			0
eventually , it would be making @entity81 $ 300 million a year			0
@entity78 now keeps a framed copy of that original audience report on his desk , as does the executive who originally said no. a lot of what @entity2 says is pretty obvious , but worth saying anyway			1
people in groups tend to make worse decisions than individuals : indeed , they will sometimes make decisions that none of them individually agrees with ( this would explain a few @entity111 winners )			1
sometimes , we think the way to solve a problem is to try harder , work longer hours , put in more effort			1
@entity2 comes up with examples to show that this can make the problem worse			1
as he puts it : ‘ there is a giant hole in the equation incentive + @entity121			0
’ ask yourself what @entity57 would do			0
let the solution come to you when you ’re least expecting it			0
@entity2 can be very @entity17 in his assumptions and his tone of voice			1
but there ’s very little of the forced cheerfulness that can bring up your breakfast with a single heave			0
his arguments are sound , his stories intriguing — and your muesli safe			0
if there ’s any higher praise for a self - help book , i ca n’t imagine it .			0
