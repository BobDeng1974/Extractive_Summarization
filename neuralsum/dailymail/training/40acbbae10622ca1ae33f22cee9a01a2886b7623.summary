by @entity0 published : 14:58 est , 14 october 2012 updated : 08:47 est , 15 october 2012 hero : a 1912 painting of @entity3 photographed in the 1860s is seen of the @entity7 @entity6 hero executed as a 17 - year - old @entity9 spy the story of @entity3 is relatively unknown outside of @entity7 , but the teenage spy who chose to hang rather than betray the @entity9 cause is a folk hero to many in his home state			1
street signs and an elementary in the state capital have long borne @entity3 's name , and admirers gather at his grave each year to pay tribute to @entity3 's life and death			1
' everyone wants to remember everything else about the @entity6 that was bad , ' said one of them , @entity26			0
' we want to remember a man that stood for what he believed in and would not tell on his friends			2
' a state commission 's decision , though , to grant approval for yet another tribute to @entity3 has revived an age - old question : should states still look for ways to commemorate historical figures who fought to defend unjust institutions ? ' ( @entity3 ) already has a school			1
i do n't know why anything else would have to be done to honor him , ' @entity44 , a school bus driver , said near the state @entity48 in downtown @entity49			0
@entity7 ' complicated history of race relations plays out on the @entity48 grounds			0
a stone and metal monument that 's stood for over a century pays tribute to the @entity7 men and boys who fought for the @entity9 and the right to own slaves			0
not far away , nine bronze statues honour the black children who , in 1957 , needed an @entity63 escort to enter what had been an all - white school			0
captured : a monument to @entity3 marks where he was captured by the @entity68 before his hanging in 1863 where an elementary school named for him now rests the newest nod to @entity3 would mark a site across town where he was detained after @entity63 soldiers found encoded notes on him about their troop locations			1
@entity3 was convicted of spying and sentenced to death , and legend has it he refused an offer to walk free in exchange for the name of the person who gave him the information			1
' he was barely 17 years old when the @entity68 hung him ' on jan. 8 , 1864 , @entity26 said			1
' yeah , he was spying , but there ( were ) other people that spied that they did n't hang			0
' @entity3 is certainly not the only teenager to die in the war or even the lone young martyr , said @entity93 , a @entity94 at @entity49 history professor			1
' if you start talking about the 16 - , 17 - and 18 - year - olds who were killed in battle , the number is infinite , ' @entity93 said			1
' there are tens of thousands of them			0
' so it seems all the more curious that some have come to portray @entity3 as @entity7 ' boy martyr			1
captured : this building known as 10 - mile - @entity106 shows where @entity3 was detained after captured by @entity63 troops in 1863 and executed in 1864 for being a @entity9 spy ' it 's part of the romanticizing of the @entity6 that began in the 1880s and the 1890s , that looks for ... what could be called heroic behaviour to celebrate in a war filled with real horrors , ' @entity93 said			1
and it 's caught on , though many question why			0
remembered : a metal and a stone monument mark the grave of @entity3 who is still visited by admirers each year ' it 's a very sad story , but at the end of the day , @entity3 was spying for the @entity9 , which was fighting a war to defend the institution of slavery , ' said @entity131 , a senior fellow at the @entity132			1
@entity133 — who lives on @entity134 ( there 's an @entity136 , too ) — said she would n't mind another @entity3 namesake in her neighbourhood			2
' the fact that we live in the @entity142 , i could understand why he would want to do it because he was actually working for us in a way			0
... for that era , i think it was probably a noble thing to do , ' @entity145 said			0
about a half - mile away , a banner outside an elementary school proclaims , ' @entity3 committed to excellence			1
' a doormat bearing @entity3 's name shows a black boy smiling next to a few white ones			2
about half of the school 's 298 students last year were black and only 27 were white			0
@entity158 , who graduated from @entity159 years after the desegregation standoff over the @entity161 , lives at the site where he says @entity3 was detained almost a century and a half ago			2
the @entity7 @entity163 approved his application and agreed to chip in $ 1,000 for the marker noting the spot 's historical significance			0
@entity158 , 59 , said the move to commemorate @entity3 is not about honouring slavery , but about remembering the past			2
' i do n't think it has a thing to do with race whatsoever , ' @entity158 said			0
' he was a 17 - year - old kid with a coded message in his boot that had enough of whatever it is in him that he did n't squeal on his sources			1
' still , in a city that stripped ' @entity182 ' from its interstate highway signs shortly before dignitaries arrived in town for the opening of @entity188 's presidential library , the question remains : should @entity3 's name be etched into another piece of stone or metal for posterity 's sake ? ' there are currently more monuments to @entity3 than any other war hero in @entity7 , ' @entity131 said			2
' you would think that at some point it would be enough			0

@entity3 is remembered as the 17 - year - old spy who chose death over ratting out his friends to the @entity68
