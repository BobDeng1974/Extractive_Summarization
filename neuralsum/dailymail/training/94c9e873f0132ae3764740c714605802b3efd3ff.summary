by @entity0 published : 05:21 est , 5 march 2014 updated : 07:55 est , 5 march 2014 from @entity3 to @entity4 via @entity5 and @entity6 , fashion week was a celebration of all things weird and wonderful			2
and ensuring that the fashion festivities went out with a bang , notoriously quirky @entity11 designer @entity10 's show in @entity4 last night closed fashion week in all its wacky glory			1
while @entity16 sent his models down a supermarket themed runway complete with trollies at @entity21 and @entity22 saw @entity23 and @entity24 skip down hers , @entity10 may have just one - upped them all			0
all in the name of fashion : models were displayed in a vacuum pack for @entity10 's @entity30 the eccentric designer , whose fans include @entity33 and @entity34 , sent her models down the catwalk vacuum - packed in giant clear plastic bags			1
the models , who were akin to quarantined aliens in the creepy display , remained motionless as fashion fans marveled the bizarre display			0
concerned and intrigued , the front row took to social media to ask the questions on everyone 's lips : how can they breathe ? is it comfortable ? others pointed out that the tubes in the bags may be used as a breathing aide ( although some of the models remained eerily still in their foetal - like position the entire show )			0
what on earth will next season bring ? breathe easy : the quirky display , whereby models were provided with tubes ( presumably to breathe into ) , closed @entity65 last night creepy : some of the models were positioned into foetal - like shapes , while others appeared to be standing up in a motionless position ready and waiting : the models were vacuum - packed long before the show guests arrived to marvel the wacky display what clothes ? while all eyes were on the crazy vacuum - packed displays , the designer , who is loved by @entity33 , offered some stylish silver dresses supermodel of the moment @entity23 partied at the @entity83 anniversary party held in @entity84 fashion pals @entity85 and photographer @entity87 also attended the party boy @entity89 provided the music at the @entity4 event			2
