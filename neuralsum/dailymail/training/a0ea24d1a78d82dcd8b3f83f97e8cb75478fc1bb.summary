the highly respected @entity1 economist @entity0 has warned against @entity3 independence , dismissing @entity5 's campaign promises as ' implausible ' and saying ' there 's no conceivable way ' @entity3 could share the pound			1
the former chairman of the @entity10 accused the @entity12 campaign of drastically understating the economic damage a @entity12 vote in thursday 's referendum would cause			1
mr @entity0 , who is known for usually being circumspect , was scathing about @entity5 ’s oil projections			2
he said : ‘ their forecasts are so implausible they really should be dismissed out of hand			1
‘ there ’s no conceivable , credible way the @entity30 is going to sit there as a lender of last resort to a new @entity3 , ’ mr @entity0 added			0
@entity34 has become increasingly concerned that its oldest ally is about to be weakened by a @entity12 vote			0
president @entity37 has twice warned against a @entity12 vote and the @entity39 yesterday said it hoped the @entity40 remained ‘ strong , robust and united ’			1
yet more high - profile figures made direct appeals to @entity3 yesterday			0
@entity43 , the former deputy secretary of state and @entity45 president , said : ‘ like many @entity1 , and given that my name is @entity43 , i have an admiration for the @entity3 , their heritage , and their role in the @entity1 and world history			2
‘ but a break - up of the @entity40 would be a diminution of @entity40 and a tragedy for the @entity54 just at a moment when the @entity1 needs strong partners			1
i strongly suspect it would not work out well for the @entity3 either			0
’ warnings : other top @entity1 figures including @entity43 , left , and @entity59 , right , have also flagged up the dangers posed by @entity3 splitting from the @entity40 plea : @entity61 last night asked @entity3 voters to trust in @entity40 and vowed radical change senator @entity59 , a former @entity64 presidential candidate who regards the @entity40 as @entity34 ’s most important military and intelligence partner , said he was reluctant to comment on an internal issue in another country			1
but he added : ‘ i do n’t see how it could be helpful , not just as far as intelligence ties are concerned but to the unique military relationship as well			0
’ another big issue for the @entity1 would be the uncertainty surrounding the future of @entity40 ’s nuclear deterrent			1
@entity1 foreign policy experts fear that a @entity3 @entity12 vote would embolden @entity78 – especially in @entity79 – even as it weakened the @entity40 and thus @entity81 ’s ability to mount a united response			1
‘ @entity78 could argue that separatist movements are actually perfectly legitimate , whether in @entity88 or eastern @entity79 , ’ said @entity83 , former @entity1 ambassador to @entity84 and now president of the @entity86			2
‘ of course , a democratic process that takes two years is not the same as an annexation and a fake referendum			0
’ yesterday , president @entity37 ’s chief spokesman , @entity92 , chose his words with care when asked to comment on @entity3 independence			0
he said : ‘ we certainly respect the right of individual @entity3 to make a decision ... along these lines			0
but , as the president himself said , we have an interest in seeing the @entity40 remain strong , robust , united and an effective partner			2
