by @entity0 published : 11:32 est , 18 september 2013 updated : 15:54 est , 18 september 2013 there 's not many places where you would find a merry - go - round styled after a ballistic missile			2
but here they take an unnerving pride in military technology			2
in case you have n't guessed already , it is , of course , @entity13			1
of course , there are no children actually enjoying the ride in a @entity18 park , for in the isolated totalitarian dictatorship state - sanctioned leisure time is strictly rationed			0
military first : a groundskeeper walks past a merry - go - round made to look like the @entity25 rocket at a park in @entity18 , the capital of @entity13 ' lets open up an era to a strong economic country ' : a propaganda poster showing the launch of space rockets stands next to a walled off @entity18 construction site taking a break : a @entity25 man sits next to his bicycle on the bank of a river as the sun sets over the unfinished 105 - storey @entity40 in @entity18 health and safety nightmare : @entity25 soldiers work on the side of a high rise building apparently under construction in @entity18 these are the latest photographs of the insular country taken by @entity50 , an @entity51 photographer who has enjoyed unusual access inside @entity13			1
vastly different from the stage managed mass events which are usually seen in pictures released by @entity13 's own state - run press , the cityscapes they show are curiously deserted , with little indication as to why save for the possibility that most of the country 's population are undoubtedly hard at work			1
elsewhere , a woman is pictured walking past the outer shell of a construction site			0
above it looms a propaganda billboard depicting the launch of @entity25 rockets			0
it reads : ' lets open up an era to a strong economic country			0
' respite comes rarely for the people of @entity13 - as it 's officially known			1
but one of the pictures shows @entity13 at a carnival , aiming airguns for a target shooting game			1
it is an appropriate diversion for the world 's most militarised society , with a total of 9,495,000 active , reserve , and paramilitary personnel , meaning that more than a third of its residents are under orders			0
cranes stand over the construction site for the @entity18 international airport terminal : visitors to @entity13 are strictly controlled and accompanied at all times the green fields of the @entity99 : cyclists ride on a rural road past farms on the outskirts of @entity18			2
the country suffers from chronic food shortages leisure time : people aim air guns as they play a target shooting carnival game at @entity18 park			0
it is an appropriate diversion for the world 's most militarised society secretive : a @entity25 tour guide stands on the top of @entity116 in @entity18 and looks down at the capital city , half hiding from the photographer 's lens mr @entity50 's photographs offer a rare insight into life in @entity13 , but even a regular visitor like him is accompanied every step of his way around the country by government guides			1
he has managed to capture a photograph of one in one of his pictures			2
a female dressed in flowing blue clothing , half hiding around a corner , it seems she is not aware she is the subject of the photograph , which ostensibly shows the @entity141 cityscape from the top of the city 's @entity116 .			0
