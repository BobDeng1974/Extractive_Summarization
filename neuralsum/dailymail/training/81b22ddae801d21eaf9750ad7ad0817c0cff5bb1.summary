when sir @entity1 gave @entity2 his man - of - the - match award at the end of last season ’s @entity6 final it was for 120 minutes of incredible football			1
but for the @entity10 winger the real ‘ game of his life ’ had been played out in the previous 14 months amid the turmoil of a career under threat at @entity14 and a baby daughter born three months premature			1
as emotional as the events of winning the club ’s 10th @entity6 in @entity21 were , nothing @entity2 achieves in football will rank alongside the story of his daughter @entity23			1
@entity23 was born three months premature on april 22 , 2013 , the night before @entity14 faced @entity44 in a @entity6 semi-final			1
@entity2 missed the game to be with his wife and the couple agonised for the next two months as their daughter stayed in intensive care before finally being allowed to go home			1
with @entity23 safe and sound @entity2 was able to turn his full attention back to playing football but @entity14 had signed @entity33 in his place and he appeared to be facing up to a season on the bench			1
dedicating his goal : @entity2 looks up to his family after scoring @entity62 's winner against @entity63 @entity2 's no 1 fan : @entity23 wears an @entity62 top with ' @entity66 ' on the back in tribute to her famous father ‘ my daughter taught me that everything that appears to be really difficult can end up being easy if you put the effort in and wait for the rewards , ’ he said			1
‘ she transmitted so much energy to me and it helped me to have the spectacular year that i had			2
’ @entity2 was the top goal provider in the @entity78 league last season with 22 assists , he scored in the @entity82 triumph over @entity83 and outplayed everyone in @entity21 as @entity14 lifted the @entity6 trophy			1
former real manager @entity86 had requested his signing four years earlier , with his agent @entity88 helping to bring the wiry winger to the @entity78 capital after two years in @entity91 with @entity92			0
the transfer fee was big at £ 20million but the wages were low and the fact that they never increased as his value to the side grew remains the main reason why he is now a @entity100 player			1
@entity101 : @entity2 was named man - of - the - match in the @entity6 final against @entity36 showboat : @entity2 enjoys performing ' rabona ' crosses , where he flicks one leg behind the other real boss @entity109 said this week that ‘ the club did everything it could to keep him ’ , but that is not the case			1
he also said after @entity14 lost the @entity114 to @entity36 without 26 - year - old @entity2 : ‘ we did n’t need him today			1
’ @entity109 was told in the summer that @entity116 would be arriving and that @entity2 would be the sacrifice			1
the coach ’s long career working for @entity120 at @entity121 means he is well - schooled in the art of accepting every command that drops down from on high , no matter how ill - advised			0
@entity14 ’s reluctance to put @entity2 on anything like pay parity with @entity33 and new signing @entity116 owes much to image			1
@entity14 ’s business model is built on footballer pin - ups			2
@entity2 does not fit the poster - boy brigade			2
nicknamed @entity132 ( the noodle ) for that long streaky physique , he is more hall of mirrors than hall of fame but there is an admirable durability to both his character and his constitution			2
before he accepted the man - of - the - match award in @entity21 last may from former @entity100 manager @entity1 he had other important business to attend to			1
on the final whistle he went looking for his father @entity145 and when they found each other pitchside it was a case of a dad hugging the son who had just lived his dream for him			0
unstoppable : @entity36 right - back @entity151 tries to stop @entity2 during the @entity114 on august 19 familiar foe : the 26 - year - old is set to complete a move to @entity100 for £ 59.7million from @entity14 @entity2 ’s father had made it to @entity158 ’s first team as a player but had his progress cut short by a knee injury that would not be career - ending today			1
he quit football and took a job delivering coal in @entity165 , regularly taking @entity166 along to help him and occasionally — when his delivery route allowed — stopping off to see his son train at @entity169 , the club that signed him when he was only seven			0
@entity2 made it to those training sessions thanks to the commitment of his mother @entity173 , who used to take the boy on her bicycle			2
each trip was a 50 - minute test of endurance with @entity2 on the back of the bike and his three - year - old sister on the handlebars			1
@entity183 runs in the family			0
daughter @entity23 celebrated her first birthday last april and the @entity186 invited all the parents and babies who had 12 months earlier shared the agony of the incubator unit of @entity14 ’s @entity191			1
all the babies born prematurely with @entity23 had , like her , survived			2
a part of @entity2 will always remain in @entity14 because of the medical staff that gave @entity23 the round - the - clock care she needed to pull through			1
it will also not be easy to swap the @entity198 22 for the no 7 at @entity200 , no matter what the historic significance of the latter — 22 is , after all , the number he picked out when he arrived at @entity14 in 2010 and ended up being the date of birth of his little girl			2
is he worth £ 59.7m ? no , and @entity100 should not have to pay that			0
they are the only club bidding			0
@entity210 ca n’t buy him because of @entity213 restrictions and @entity214 turned down the chance to buy him this summer for the same reason			0
it will be interesting to see if the clubs agree on the price paid			0
@entity14 said @entity33 cost around € 90m and @entity221 insisted it was € 100m			0
the sale of @entity2 is hugely unpopular , so @entity14 president @entity223 needs the highest price possible			1
where will he play ? the most logical position for @entity2 in @entity227 ’s 3 - 5 - 2 is in the midfield five just inside the left wing back			2
last season he played on the left of the midfield three at @entity14 and had his best season at the club			2
he can cover the runs of the left wing back and makes runs to the left to get round the back of teams			0
his versatility is one of his best qualities			0
in a 3 - 5 - 2 he could play left wing back ; he could play left or right in a 4 - 4 - 2 ; and in a 4 - 3 - 3 , in the midfield three or front three			0
@entity86 even had him down as an emergency left back			0
is he a worthy no 7 ? @entity247 tweeted : ‘ thanks for everything			0
i wish you all the best , even if you are going to @entity100			0
we will never forget the zig - zag in extra time in @entity21			2
’ tired legs everywhere and @entity2 as fresh as if it were the 10th minute , not the 110th , hurtling down the left and crossing to @entity33 for the @entity6 - winning goal			1
if he produces moments like that for @entity100 he will be more than worthy			0
why are real selling ? the same reason they sold @entity262 in 2009			0
the desire for new stars must be financed , in part , by sales			0
three @entity6 finals later , nobody can say @entity269 were wrong to sign @entity262 .			0

the versatile midfielder was one of @entity14 's stars last season and was named man - of - the - match in the @entity6 final win over @entity36
former @entity100 boss sir @entity1 presented him the award
@entity2 *attributes* his successes with @entity14 to his daughter @entity23 's survival after being born three months premature
a year before his @entity6 final *heroics* , doctors gave @entity2 and his wife 's baby a 30 per cent chance of survival after she was born
the @entity10 scored in the @entity82 final win against @entity83 and was the best player on the pitch in @entity21 when @entity14 won @entity101
@entity2 said : ‘ my daughter taught me everything that appears to be really difficult can end up being easy if you put effort in and wait for the rewards ’
nicknamed ' noodle ' , @entity2 was *pushed* out of the @entity303 this summer after @entity14 signed @entity304 star @entity116 from @entity305
