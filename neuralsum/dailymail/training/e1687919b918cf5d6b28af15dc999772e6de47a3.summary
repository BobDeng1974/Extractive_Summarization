@entity0 has come under fire once again for offering customers just half the amount of advertised storage on its flagship @entity6 model			2
the latest round of tests by which ? magazine found that unwanted bloatware and system files still occupy 46 per cent of the phone 's internal storage - eight months after intial concerns were raised			1
at the opposite end of the scale , @entity18 's @entity17 was the best performing handset , assigning a relatively low 21 per cent of storage to built - in apps and the @entity24 operating system			1
in january , which ? magazine tested the eight most popular @entity27 handsets from @entity0 , @entity18 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 , pictured			1
@entity0 's @entity6 was the worst performing handset , with only 54 % ( @entity32 ) of available storage , while @entity18 's @entity17 was the best , with 79 % ( @entity34 ) bloatware is the name for any unwanted software or apps that are preinstalled onto phones , tablets , or computers			1
as well as taking up space that can be used for photos and other personal files , bloatware can also slow down your device			0
bloatware can also refer to extras that come with wanted software including browser toolbars , desktop widgets or other unwanted additions			0
bloatware includes apps and files that are added to handsets by the manufacturers and networks before they are sold to customers			0
which ? magazine tested the eight most popular @entity27 handsets including @entity18 's @entity62 and @entity17 , @entity0 's @entity6 , @entity31 's @entity63 , the @entity64 , @entity28 's @entity65 , the @entity66 and @entity29 's @entity67			1
the @entity6 offers just @entity68 of available storage , down from @entity70 in tests carried out in may			2
@entity18 's @entity17 has @entity72 , while the @entity62 offers slightly less at @entity73			1
@entity29 's @entity67 and @entity66 have just short of @entity74 and @entity75 respectively			0
some of the preinstalled @entity0 files are needed for its new features , such as eye tracking , air gestures and voice commands			0
some of the preinstalled @entity0 files on the @entity6 , pictured , are needed for features such as eye tracking , air gestures and voice commands			2
others , however , are unnecessary or unwanted utility apps , games and the @entity90 and @entity91 hubs			0
many of which ca n't be removed others , however , are unnecessary or unwanted utility apps , games and the @entity90 and @entity91 hubs			0
to add insult to injury , many of these apps and hubs ca n't be removed			0
it 's likely the difference between @entity18 's models are due to the @entity62 running more advanced features than the @entity17 , and the extra files needed for the fingerprint scanner			2
as technology researcher @entity109 explained in a blog post : ' the reality is every phone has to sacrifice some of its internal memory to the operating system - they never live up to the sales talk of 8,16 or @entity115			0
' but many manufacturers further stuff their phone with pre-loaded apps , skins and bloatware			0
and no phone has more piping , braiding and frills than the @entity6			0
' @entity18 's @entity17 , pictured , has @entity72 of available space , while the high - end @entity62 offers slight less , as @entity73			1
it 's likely the difference between @entity18 's models are due to the @entity62 running more advanced features than the @entity17 , and the extra files needed for the fingerprint scanner the @entity0 findings show the handset has not improved since tests last may - and has actually got worse			1
@entity0 responded to criticisms at the time advising people that a solution that to the problem is to buy a microsd card if they want extra storage : ' for the @entity6 16 gb model , approximately 6.85 @entity32 occupies the system part of internal memory , which is 1 gb bigger than that of the @entity145 , in order to provide a high resolution display and more powerful features to our consumers , ' explained the @entity152 firm			1
' to offer the ultimate mobile experience to our users , @entity0 provides a microsd slot on @entity6 for extension of memory			2
' yet , as @entity109 points out , the three phones that topped the latest which ? tests - @entity18 's @entity17 , @entity62 and @entity31 's @entity63 - do n't have memory card slots meaning that although they offer more overall , this ca n't be expanded like the @entity6			1
