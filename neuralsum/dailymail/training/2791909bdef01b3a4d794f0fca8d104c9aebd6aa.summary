it is understood that the @entity5 gunman who slayed 76 people on friday took part in a march organised by the far - right movement in @entity10 in may 2010 - and another in @entity11			1
@entity12 said the claims were now being ' thoroughly investigated '			1
protest : @entity5 gunman @entity0 marched in this @entity2 rally in @entity10 in may 2010 rally : @entity0 is also said to have met with @entity2 leaders when he visited @entity17 last year hundreds of @entity2 supporters , including families with children , gathered outside @entity10 's @entity21 draped in @entity23 flags			1
they chanted ' @entity26 ' til i die ' and ' no surrender to the @entity29 ' , ' you 're not @entity26 anymore , ' and ' we 're going to go mental , chicken oriental			0
' at the march , hundreds of police officers , drafted from five different forces , guarded the streets to prevent clashes as @entity38 staged a counter-protest at the same time			0
last year 's march , although tense , passed without incident			2
@entity43 police chief supt @entity42 said at the time : ' it has been a great success			0
it has passed without incident			0
' @entity10 is a city for peace and the aim of today was to allow peaceful protests which we have demonstrated is possible through careful planning			1
' appearance : @entity0 pictured leaving an @entity56 court house after his first hearing on friday , @entity0 , 32 , set off a car bomb in the centre of @entity56 that killed eight people , before travelling to an @entity62 island , massacring 68 teenagers attending a @entity65 summer camp			1
a leading @entity67 member of the organisation @entity38 said it was no surprise to him that security sources were aware of @entity0 's activity in this country			1
he said he had been on a counter demonstration to the @entity2 march			0
he said : ' it is alleged he ( @entity0 ) has contacts with about 600 @entity2 contacts in @entity17			1
given that is the case , it is highly likely he will have had contacts with people in the @entity67			0
' given that the travel links with the @entity67 and @entity5 are better than anywhere else other than @entity11 , i am not surprised that he attended here			2
' the @entity2 and other far right organisations do operate internationally - they see themselves as almost @entity87			2
' the @entity2 has issued a statement insisting that it has never had any official contact with @entity0 and that there was no evidence that he ever registered as a supporter on the @entity2 facebook page			1
but today anti-fascist organisation @entity94 claimed @entity0 was told he would be welcome at their @entity17 demonstrations , to which he replied : ' i hoped so : it ’s our common struggle against the islamofascists			1
' @entity0 used the internet pseudonym ' @entity101 ' , a 12th century @entity102 who led one of the crusades , to communicate online with supporters of the @entity2 and told them : ' you ’re a blessing to all in @entity108			1
' only a few days before friday ’s attacks the messages to @entity2 supporters stopped as he began the final countdown to his massacre			0
searchlight 's editor @entity94 told the @entity115 : ' this proves conclusively @entity0 was in contact with the @entity2 , shared their aims and objectives and expressed a desire to join them on their demonstration			1
' it is quite clear that the @entity125 now need to classify the @entity2 as an extremist right - wing organisation and to devote similar resources to monitoring their activities as they would other extremist groups			2
' in the online messages @entity0 wrote : ' to you all good @entity26 men and women , just wanted to say that you ’re a blessing to all in @entity108 , in these dark times all of @entity108 are looking to you in search of inspiration , courage and even hope that we might turn this evil trend with @entity140 all across our continent			1
' well , just wanted to say keep up the good work it ’s good to see others that care about their country and heritage			0
' in another posting @entity0 claims he visited @entity148 with a friend ' some years ago '			1
he wrote : ' i ’ve seen with my own eyes what has happened to england , i was in bradford some years ago , me and a friend walked down to the football stadium of bradford , real ‘ nice ’ neighborhood , same thing in the suburbs of @entity11			0
' one @entity2 supporter then wrote to @entity0 : ' @entity161 , admire your views and courage			1
' yesterday , as @entity0 admitted the killings but pleaded not guilty to criminal responsibility in a closed hearing , prime minister @entity12 said the gunman 's links to this country were being investigated ' extremely seriously '			1
in a rambling 1,500 - page manifesto @entity0 posted online shortly before the attacks , he said that he was acting alone , but had been recruited to the radical cause by two @entity26 rightwing extremists at a meeting in the @entity17 in 2002			1
he wrote : ' i used to have more than 600 @entity2 members as @entity180 friends and have spoken with tens of @entity2 members and leaders			0
carnage : @entity0 opened fire on children who were on the @entity5 holiday island of @entity62 ' in fact i was one of the individuals who provided them with processed ideological material ( including rhetorical strategies ) in the very beginning			1
' another source said a senior member of the @entity2 has also claimed @entity0 met with the group 's leaders in @entity17 last year , when he came to @entity11 to hear @entity197 , the @entity198 right - wing politician , speak			1
he said : ' he is someone who can project himself very well and i presume there would be those who would be quite taken by that			0
it 's like @entity204 , people said he hypnotic			2
this guy had the same sort of effect			0
' the source told the @entity209 that @entity0 knew three of four people in the group and told his @entity180 friends he wanted to attend			1
he added : ' @entity197 was a high - profile @entity213 politician , coming to @entity17			1
everybody was raving about it			0
he was obviously in contact with some of us			0
' respects : a candle - lit vigil in @entity56 on monday night saw thousands pay tribute to those killed in the twin @entity5 attacks a @entity227 politician with links to the far - right blamed ' immigration and @entity231 ' for the @entity5 massacre			2
@entity227 democrat @entity233 wrote in his blog that he did not feel any guilt in sharing the opinions of @entity0			2
he wrote : ' if there was no @entity140 and mass immigration there would not have been something that triggered @entity0 to do what he did			1
' he later told @entity242 : ' the ultimate responsibility always lies on the offender			0
' but you should discuss the underlying causes that drove him , which was multiculturalism			0
' @entity0 also referred to the @entity248 23 times in his manifesto			2
the @entity2 , which has risen to prominence over the last two years with its anti-islamist protests , has denied ' any official contact ' with the killer			0
@entity0 was placed on a @entity5 security watch list in march after his name was linked to the purchase of chemicals from a @entity260 supplier			2
but the head of @entity5 's police intelligence agency said they had not followed it up because he had only bought £ 11 worth of the chemicals			2
mr @entity12 , who yesterday discussed the massacre with security chiefs and senior ministers at a meeting of the @entity269 , said : ' we are still investigating these claims , so i do n't want to give out partial information			2
' we want to get to the bottom of this before making public announcements			0
but we take these things extremely seriously			0
' @entity12 , who was at the @entity278 in @entity11 to sign a book of condolences , added : ' everyone in @entity17 shares in the sorrow and the anger at the despicable killings that took place on friday			1
' @entity17 and @entity5 have been good allies and neighbours in very dark days before			2
we know that the resilience and the courage and the decency of our @entity5 friends will overcome this act			0
' after such a dreadful event the @entity294 must of course review our own security at home			0
' the @entity115 also reported that @entity94 has revealed that a millionaire computer engineer living in north @entity11 is a backer of the @entity2			0
@entity299 , 45 , is said to have admitted providing funds to the organisation and is alleged to have posed online this week , in reference to the twin attacks : ' the chickens have actually come home to roost			0
