the final touches are just about done for one of the biggest nights in @entity4 boxing on november 22 , when @entity5 and @entity7 's rematch will headline a huge show at the @entity9 in @entity10			1
there have been setbacks but everything is now agreed and they are ready to go at each other again			0
i can also confirm that it will be an eliminator for the world cruiserweight title and currently we almost have a pick of the belts to go for			0
my best bet would be that the winner fights @entity24 for the @entity26 title , but in reality i think the loser will also get a world - title shot			2
frankly , this is the highest - profile fight in the whole division , a real grudge match , and the impression i get from my conversations is that all the title holders will want a piece of these two going forward			2
@entity5 says he will knock @entity7 out in their grudge rematch at @entity10 's @entity9 @entity39 ( right ) beat @entity7 ( left ) in a tight majority decision in their first encounter in 2011 @entity5 has vowed to become a two - weight world champion by disposing of @entity7 the card will be on @entity46 and i must say i am proud to announce here the incredible line up we have			2
@entity49 will defend his @entity51 world super bantamweight title and we are in negotiations witg @entity54 , a two - time world champion , and also highly - ranked @entity56			1
this would be the biggest test of @entity49 's career and he has too much on the horizon for a slip up			1
we have begun initial talks with the @entity63 over the fight everyone wants to see â€“ @entity68 v @entity66			1
@entity66 has an injury at the moment and i would n't expect him to fight again until february or march so we wanted to get @entity49 out in the meantime			1
i 'm confident the fight with @entity66 is going to happen next year			2
also on the bill , i have @entity74 looking to impress ahead of his mandatory shot against @entity76 next year			1
we have agreed terms with his opponent , it 's a real fight - and we will announce the fight as soon as the contracts are signed			1
@entity66 won his @entity84 super-bantamweight world title bout against @entity85 in @entity86 @entity74 beat @entity87 earlier this year and will get a shot at @entity76 next year the @entity10 card will also include @entity51 world bantamweight champion @entity90 against @entity91 with the winner facing a unification bout with @entity26 champion @entity94 after we agreed a deal last week			1
then , of course , there 's @entity99			1
he will fight @entity100 in an eliminator for the @entity4 title after fighting first on october 11 against @entity103 for the @entity105 international heavyweight title			1
the october 11 show at the @entity107 will be @entity99 's first title fight ahead of a world title shot by the end of 2015			1
i ca n't tell you how excited i am by this guy			0
the stabilisers are off and now we are picking up serious speed			0
also on the @entity10 show , there will be an outing for the incredible and unbeaten @entity120 and his brother @entity121			1
@entity120 will face a huge step up against @entity124 star @entity123 ( 27 - 2 ) whose only defeats have come via points losses to @entity127 and recently @entity128 for the @entity26 world title			1
the bout has been approved by the @entity105 as an official eliminator with the winner moving into a final eliminator in 2015			0
it 's a massive statement fight for @entity120 - he is ready ! i ca n't help thinking that this will be the highest quality card in this country in years with plenty more still to come			1
i 'd like to say a few words about @entity138 , who travelled to @entity139 last weekend and lost his world title challenge on points to @entity128			0
i am sickened by the scorecards that were produced in @entity143			0
everyone knows that if you fight away then it is unlikely you will get the verdict from a tight fight			2
and this was a very tight fight , so i knew what we were up against when i climbed in the ring at the end of the fight			2
@entity138 ( right ) says he wants a rematch against @entity128 after his defeat on saturday @entity138 gave a good account of himself against @entity128 and many have questioned the result the judges voted unanimously in favour of @entity128 , much to @entity120 's frustration and disappointment but to hear the three judges gives @entity128 , a great champion , the verdict by such wide margins was a disgrace			1
it was inept judging at its worse			0
we have made an official petition to the @entity26 and they will review the footage and i can not see any other option than to make @entity138 the mandatory challenger for the title and order an immediate rematch			0
i 'd also like to see greater scrutiny placed on judges in terms of a greater test of their knowledge of the sport			2
these people have livelihoods and dreams in their hands and can not be allowed to make such terrible decisions			0
i 've been talking in detail with @entity191 and they are very keen for us to come back with another show after the success of @entity194			2
i can reveal here that i have pencilled in june 27 and july 4 and will likely hold a show on one of those dates			1
it could be @entity76 , possibly against @entity74 , and @entity200 versus @entity201 would fill it			1
@entity200 will probably make his comeback in march and would then be ready for a huge summer fight			2
@entity76 knocked out @entity206 in their second fight at @entity209 earlier this year i 've got a show in @entity211 on october 4 and it could potentially place two top @entity4 fighters on a collision course			1
we have @entity215 , a great young fighter who at 23 already has the @entity4 and @entity217 featherweight title			2
on saturday he fights @entity218 for the @entity220 belt at the @entity221			0
@entity215 is the biggest individual ticket seller in the country			0
he sells 2,000 himself , through his own phone , more or less			0
then he often delivers them by hand			0
the @entity220 title was vacated by @entity229 @entity228 , who fights @entity230 in an @entity84 world title eliminator on the october 11 bill in @entity233			0
the idea of @entity228 and @entity235 fighting in the future appeals to me			0
the @entity211 card will also see @entity239 return after his world title challenge , and @entity241 fights at light - welterweight against @entity243			0
expect one of the best atmospheres you 've seen on saturday - the @entity211 fans are ready to blow the roof off			0
there 's a lot to look forward to at the moment .			0

i can reveal here one of the best fight cards to have happened in @entity4 boxing
@entity258 , as well as fights for @entity49 , @entity74 , @entity99 , @entity90 and @entity120 on november 22
i am in talks with @entity191 for @entity76 or @entity262 over june 27 or july 4 dates
it 's time boxing judges did their jobs properly
