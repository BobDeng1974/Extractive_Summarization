‘ it can also affect speech development , because so many mothers stick a dummy in their toddler ’s mouth just to shut the toddler up			2
the toddler just sits there sucking away on its dummy and does n’t talk or do anything			2
’ she added : ‘ if a mother allows her toddler to have a dummy in her mouth for large parts of the day , she will definitely stunt her speech development			2
’ most experts recommend parents wean a child off dummies before their first birthday because the habit becomes harder to break as they get older and can lead to thumb - sucking , which can also damage teeth			0
