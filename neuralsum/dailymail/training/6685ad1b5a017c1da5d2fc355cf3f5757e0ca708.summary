tiring : prince @entity0 has had a long wait - the longest ever the birth of baby @entity2 , a boost in sales for @entity5 - and prince @entity0 has broken a record to add to his year of milestones - although this one may come with a pinch of frustration			1
the @entity0 - who has in the past joked about being ' impatient ' and about ' running out of time ' - today become the oldest heir to the throne for almost 300 year , successor to @entity15 , who at the age of 87 holds the title of oldest monarch in @entity20 history			1
the oldest heir apparent until today was @entity22 , who became monarch in june 1830 , aged 64 years , ten months and five days , on the death of his father @entity25 @entity22 died without an heir in 1837 and was succeeded by his niece - queen @entity27 , who went on to become the country 's longest reigning monarch , with 63 years on the throne			1
he still has @entity31 to beat as the oldest heir to the throne			1
the princess died aged 83 in 1714 , a few months before @entity35 died			1
@entity0 became heir apparent on the death of his grandfather @entity38 , when his mother succeeded to the throne on february 6 1952			1
the @entity0 was just three years old at the time and from a young age has been groomed to be king			2
@entity0 is already the longest serving heir to the throne having passed , a number of years ago , the previous record set by @entity46 who became monarch aged 59 , when his mother @entity27 died in 1901			1
the @entity0 became a grandfather for the first time in july when @entity2 was born to the @entity52 and @entity53			2
before the birth the heir to the throne said he was ' thrilled ' and even joked about how the latest development in his eventful life had come at the age of 64			2
' and with the @entity15 still in excellent health - despite a few hospital visits - he could be in for an even longer wait			0
aside from a brief hospital visit in march this year - a precautionary measure , the @entity69 said , while she was assessed for the symptoms of the stomach bug gastroentiritis , she has not had a hospital stay for ten years			0
and despite his positive comments about being an old grandfather , the @entity0 has in the past hinted that he is feeling the long wait			0
outlived : the oldest heir to the throne , @entity31 ( left ) , died aged 83 in 1714 - a few months before @entity35 ( pictured right , monarch from 1665 to 1714 ) , whom she was due to succeed 64 : @entity22 59 : @entity46 40 : @entity38 37 : @entity82 25 : @entity83 and @entity15 18 : @entity27 17 : @entity84 9 : @entity85 during a visit to @entity87 in @entity88 last year , he recorded a film for the @entity91 website in which the then 64 - year - old heir suggested his time as monarch might be cut short			1
he said : ' impatient ? me ? what a thing to suggest ! yes of course i am			0
' he added : “ i ’ll run out of time soon			0
i shall have snuffed it if i ’m not careful			0
' and even before then , @entity0 made a number of comments regarding his time as heir			2
in 1992 , on the eve of the @entity15 ’s 40th anniversary on the throne , he attended the funeral of his father - in - law , the 8th @entity108 , where he is believed to have remarked to @entity110 , his then brother - in - law : ' you are fortunate enough to have succeeded to the title when still young			0
' in 2004 , a @entity114 officer at @entity115 who congratulated him on his 56th birthday got the response : ' i ’m now at the age at which my grandfather died			0
' royal biographer @entity120 said : ' he is impatient , but when he becomes king , his activities and all the projects he most enjoys where he can make a difference , will be seriously curtailed			0
heirs to the throne : the @entity15 looks out from @entity127 , engaged in conversation with prince @entity22 ... while @entity0 , the first in line to the throne , looks on ' he has spent an awful lot of his life searching for a role , but i think he does now feel fulfilled pursuing his various interests			2
' and with the wedding of prince @entity22 to @entity137 last year , prince @entity0 also must cope with being sidelined by the younger members of his family			1
a poll in july - at the time of the birth of @entity2 - named the most popular royals after the @entity15 as the @entity52 and @entity53 , along with prince @entity144			0
and although 42 per cent of those surveyed by the @entity147 poll said prince @entity0 should be the next heir to the throne , 38 per cent were in favour of prince @entity22 being the next king			1
prime of life : at the beginning of this month , the @entity15 looked far younger than her 86 years as she watched a sack race at the @entity155 in @entity156			0
