man @entity0 , the gunman responsible for the @entity2 cafe siege , fooled the @entity4 government into granting him refugee status			1
the @entity7 extremist claimed he was an @entity8 spy and that his life would be in danger if he was sent home			1
@entity0 approached the government in 1997 with a signed letter on an @entity16 letterhead , which lobbied @entity17 on his behalf , the @entity12 reported			2
it has been revealed that @entity0 was given an @entity4 permanent protection visa without much investigation , after @entity16 purportedly lobbied the @entity43 on his behalf			2
the revelation comes after tapes of the man responsible for the @entity48 terror plot delivering religious rants , saying ' society should behave in an @entity7 manner ' , were unearthed			1
in 2009 , the self - styled sheik - five years before he carried out the 16 - hour attack where he held 18 people hostage in @entity48 's @entity55 in @entity57 's @entity56 last month - imparted his extremist views to a crowd inside a prayer hall in the city 's western suburbs			1
the december siege , which shocked @entity4 and sparked an outpouring of grief from across the nation , ended with the deaths of cafe manager @entity68 and mother - of - three @entity70 - who worked as a barrister at nearby law chambers @entity73			1
the footage , translated by a @entity76 translator for @entity12 , slammed overseas government who experienced the most violent of crimes , saying : ' your intelligence service is not working properly '			0
he believed governments who were ' not aware that there [ was ] criminal activity happening in your country ' then officials should resign from their positions as they were ' incompetent '			0
at times , @entity0 became so passionate he was seen thumping his fists to drive home his message			2
showing his level of paranoia , the terrorist also warned one of the biggest threats against fundamentalist @entity99 lay within their community			0
@entity0 believed moderate @entity99 would spell the death of extremists			2
canvassing what he thought was the virtues of @entity107 law , he pushed the case for @entity4 to take on more of the @entity7 culture			0
@entity0 and two of his hostages , @entity68 and @entity70 , were killed in the bloody conclusion to the siege in the early hours of december 16 ' the core of an @entity7 society is justice , social justice			1
@entity50 should behave in an @entity7 manner and there should be justice , ' he said			1
in the same year he fell off the radar of intelligence agencies , @entity0 warned about keeping an eye on ' friends ' who assimilated into the community before delivering terror			0
' an enemy would bluntly claim that they are the enemy			0
an ignorant friend claims that they are friends and they approach you , you would socialise with them and associate with them , but one day like a bear , they lift a big stone and they hit it to the face of that person and kills him , ' he said			0
@entity0 went on to say people should fear the ones who declared ' @entity7 is in jeopardy '			1
adding to the terrifying picture that has been pieced together of @entity0 over the past couple of weeks following the siege , friends of the gunman said he was an enigma who set up political party @entity149 and funded a @entity151 warehouse to be turned into a prayer hall			2
@entity153 ( pictured ) , who was assisted by @entity0 in 2007 when he sought @entity155 's seat in @entity57 's western suburb of @entity157 , said he knew man @entity20 ' very well ' and insisted that the @entity57 siege gunman was ' not violent ' refugee advocate @entity159 told @entity160 he did not know where @entity0 ' money was sourced and the terrorist was ' mysterious '			1
mr @entity159 added the gunman was good at networking from both sides of the @entity167 and @entity168 , saying ' he knew a lot about everybody , they knew nothing about him '			0
the advocate said @entity0 worshiped at different mosques around @entity57 , which included @entity175 's @entity174 , in @entity57 's west - a location where these religious rants were given			1
the way @entity0 spoke was described as ' slow ' and ' low - pitched '			0
mr @entity159 said the gunman was a ' very good listener ' who ' was n't stupid , he 's intelligent '			2
it comes after former failed politician and @entity183 detainee , who previously employed gunman @entity0 , claimed he could have convinced the 50 - year - old to end the @entity57 siege without resorting to violence			1
his offer was one of many put forward by other @entity167 community members , including the @entity190 , @entity191 ( pictured )			0
all of these are believed to have been rejected @entity153 , who was assisted by @entity0 in 2007 when he sought @entity155 's seat in @entity57 's western suburb of @entity157 , told @entity195 he knew him ' very well ' and insisted that @entity0 was ' not violent '			1
despite this show of support , @entity0 will be buried in an undisclosed location in @entity199 after the @entity200 reportedly refused to bury him			0
the wrongly accused former @entity183 detainee , who was tortured after being arrested in @entity202 under the false pretences he had knowledge of the september 11 attacks , claimed @entity0 was only seeking attention			0
mr @entity153 offered to help negotiate with the gunman during the siege , and maintains that @entity0 , while ' sick and disturbed ' was motivated by his problems with the government and his limited ability to contact his children			1
he insistently told @entity195 he believed @entity0 had no intention of harming any of the 18 people he took hostage at the @entity216 in @entity48 on december 15 , nor that his attack was associated with motivations linked to terrorist organisation the @entity220			1
his offer of help police negotiate with the 50 - year - old was one of many put forward by other @entity167 community members , including the @entity190 , @entity191			0
all of these are believed to have been rejected			0
meanwhile , @entity0 ' body has finally been claimed by some of his anonymous acquaintances , and will be buried somewhere in @entity199 within the next few days , according to the @entity12			0
it follows claims from the @entity200 no @entity167 funeral home would accept him as his body remained in the morgue unclaimed , days after the siege had ended			2
an islamic state propaganda magazine lavished @entity0 ' with praise for the siege , labelling the hostage crisis a ' daring raid ' and calling for more lone wolf attacks in @entity4			2

@entity0 convinced authorities he was an @entity8 spy and that his life would be in in *­* danger if he was sent home
footage of *mastermind* behind the @entity48 siege has also *surfaced*
in 2009 , man @entity0 delivered religious rants in @entity57 's west
the gunman is heard saying : ' society should behave in an @entity7 manner '
he held 18 people , including @entity68 and @entity70 , hostage
