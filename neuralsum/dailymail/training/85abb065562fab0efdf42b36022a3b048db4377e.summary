by @entity0 prostate cancer could be a sexually transmitted disease caused by an infection passed on during intercourse , scientists have said			1
researchers at the @entity7 discovered a sexually transmitted infection called trichomoniasis helps the growth of cancer cells in human prostate cells , when grown in a laboratory			1
but the team behind the discovery say more research is now needed to confirm the link			0
researchers at the @entity7 have discovered that men infected with the sexually transmitted infection trichomoniasis are more susceptible to developing prostate cancer			1
the study found the infection encourages the growth of cancer cells in prostate cells ( pictured under the microscope ) and experts at @entity28 told the @entity29 that more clinical studies are needed before the disease can be added to the list of cancers caused by @entity34			1
trichomoniasis is the most common non-viral sexually transmitted infection , affecting around 275 million people across the world			1
many people suffering the effects of the infection will have no symptoms			0
for those that do , they develop after around a month and for women cause soreness and itching around the vagina as well as a change in vaginal discharge			0
infected men may feel itching or irritation in the penis , pain during urination as well as a white discharge from the penis			0
in the new study , professor @entity58 found the parasite that causes trichomoniasis - @entity61 - secretes a protein that causes inflammation and increased growth and invasion of benign and cancerous prostate cells			1
a study carried out in 2006 at @entity68 discovered men infected with trichomoniasis have a 40 per cent greater chance of developing prostate cancer			1
a study carried out in 2006 at @entity68 discovered men infected with trichomoniasis have a 40 per cent greater chance of developing prostate cancer			1
the @entity34 is the most common non-viral sexually transmitted infection , affecting around 275million people across the world each year prostate cancer is now the most common cancer in men in the @entity80			1
more than 41,700 men are diagnosed across the country each year			0
the disease tends to be rare in men under the age of 50 , and more than half of cases are diagnosed in men over the age of 70			0
age is the greatest risk factor , the older a man the more likely it is that he will develop the disease			0
in old age around eight in 10 men have prostate cancer cells in their prostate			1
in the @entity80 , about one in nine men will get prostate cancer at some point in their lives			2
if a man has a father or brother diagnosed with the disease they are two to three times more likely of developing prostate cancer , compared to the average man			2
the age at which a relative is diagnosed , affects a man 's risk - if a relative is diagnosed at a young age , it may be a sign of a faulty gene causing the cancer			0
men who have relatives with breast cancer may also be at greater risk of developing the disease , particularly if their relative is diagnosed younger than 60			2
scientists have been working to identify genes that may increase the risk of prostate cancer			0
in 2008 , @entity28 scientists discovered seven gene changes that increase a man 's risk of developing the disease			0
some studies have found a link between an increased risk of prostate cancer in men who have had colon cancer			2
source : @entity28 @entity137 , who led the research , urged caution at the time , adding the link she found was ' not conclusive ' comparing the science to the early connections drawn between smoking and lung cancer			2
speaking at the time , she said : ' it 's still in a really exploratory phase			0
' a subsequent study found no connection between the sti and prostate cancer , while another at @entity152 found an even greater likelihood of cancer in infected men than the 2006 study			1
research in 2009 discovered a quarter of men with prostate cancer showed signs of having been infected with the @entity34 , and were also found to have more advanced tumours			1
the new study , published in the journal @entity163 , now suggests the infection might make men more vulnerable to developing prostate cancer , though does not provide proof of the link			1
the team have called for more research to build on their work , to work towards proving the link			0
@entity172 , health information officer at @entity28 , said : ' this study suggests a possible way the parasite @entity61 could encourage prostate cancer cells to grow and develop more quickly			2
' but the research was only done in the lab , and previous evidence in patients failed to show a clear link between prostate cancer and this common sexually transmitted infection			2
' there 's been a lot of research into prostate cancer risk and we 're working hard to piece together the puzzle			0
' but there are still no known lifestyle factors that seem to affect the risk of developing the disease - and no convincing evidence for a link with infection			0

researchers at the @entity7 have discovered a link between the @entity34 trichomoniasis and the growth of cancer cells in the prostate
study found infection makes men more vulnerable to the disease
but scientists and experts have called for more research to prove link
trichomoniasis is the most common non-viral @entity34 affecting millions
