by @entity0 published : 08:32 est , 1 august 2013 updated : 09:00 est , 1 august 2013 as the debate in @entity4 rages on over plain cigarette packaging , @entity1 is set to crack down further on smoking with a 50 per cent hike in the rate of tobacco tax			1
the country introduced the world 's harshest packaging laws when it outlawed all branding on cigarette packets except for the name of the manufacturer , printed in small type			1
the packages boast graphic photographs of diseased body parts , including gangrenous limbs , and of smokers dying from cancer			2
gory : cigarettes in @entity1 must carry graphic images instead of branding from the manufacturer the @entity4 government had pledged to introduce a similar law in the @entity4 , but performed a u-turn last month - allegedly in response to lobbying from the tobacco industry			1
@entity1 ministers today announced that taxes on tobacco will rise by 12.5 per cent in each of the next four years			2
the country is believed to have the second most expensive cigarettes in the world behind only @entity39 , with the average pack costing around a $ 13.50 ( £ 8 )			2
but this will climb still higher following today 's decision by treasurer @entity43 , who is aiming to eliminate the government 's deficit			0
offputting : but it is not clear how effective plain cigarette packaging really is warning : packets in @entity1 carry photographs of cancer patients in a bid to deter smokers the price of an average pack is expected to rise by a $ 5 over the four - year period , raising a total of a $ 5.3billion			0
' this i know wo n't be universally popular with all , ' mr @entity43 said			0
' it 's a difficult decision but a decision which is taken in the best interests of the nation			0
' since december 1 , all packs of cigarettes sold in @entity1 have borne gruesome photographs instead of manufacturer 's branding			1
the coalition government was planning to impose the same rules in @entity4 , but last month decided to delay the law so officials could study how the policy works in @entity1			1
crackdown : the @entity1 government has announced a massive hike in tobacco tax @entity76 accused the government of being influenced by @entity79 strategist @entity78 , whose lobbying firm has previously worked for @entity81			1
however , ministers have insisted that it is sensible to wait for more evidence before imposing new legislation			0
the effects of the @entity1 law have so far been mixed - although many smokers say they are more likely to grow up , cigarette makers have not seen a significant dent in sales			0
a study of 500 @entity1 smokers showed most believed their cigarettes were less satisfying and of lower quality than a year ago , with most also thinking more about quitting			0
however , @entity81 said : ' there has been no noticeable impact on legal tobacco sales in the first six months due to plain packaging			2

£ *3.1billion* tax hike aims to cut down tobacco use and slash deficit
comes seven months after introduction of graphic images on packs
but plans to outlaw cigarette branding in the @entity4 have been *shelved*
