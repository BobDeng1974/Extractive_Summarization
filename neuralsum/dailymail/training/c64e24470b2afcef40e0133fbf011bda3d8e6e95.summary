meet the man who built @entity1 … from paper			2
@entity3 recently completed this remarkably detailed modular origami models of @entity6 ’s cathedral using folded bits of paper			1
the school teacher spent the past year meticulously building the incredibly accurate replicas of the historic landmark in the @entity13 capital with tens of thousands of pieces of paper			0
the 42 - year - old , from the village of @entity18 in southern @entity13 , has plenty to show for all his hard work , as he unveiled the awe - inspiring work he built at home , which stands at 1.5 metres tall			1
remarkable : @entity3 , 42 , puts the finishing touches to his incredible modular origami model of @entity25 at his home in @entity18 meticulous : @entity3 has spent a year working on the detailed model , even adhering to the bright colour scheme of the beautiful building @entity3 said he did n’t even take a sketch of the impressive building , but was still able to produce his glorious interpretations of the cathedral for a @entity13 arts and crafts festival			1
the art teacher has been fascinated by the @entity40 art form origami for some time , and says that most of his free time is spent cobbling together the modular pieces which make up the parts of his models			1
he has begun teaching origami to the children at the schools he works at , some 300 miles from the nearest major city , @entity47 , @entity48			2
proud : art teacher @entity3 spends much of his spare time building the carefully crafted modular origami models , and even teaches it to his pupils complex : @entity3 built the cathedral using more than 60,000 components , all made from folded pieces of paper better than the real thing ? his creation looks remarkably similar to @entity6 's in @entity1 , even though @entity3 claims he did n't even use a sketch the talented modeller has somehow found the time to build animals like rabbits and roosters , as well as dragons , trains and other buildings			1
a perfectionist , @entity3 is often forced to disassemble his works midway through building them to make crucial refinements , improving their accuracy and authenticity			0
so detailed are his creations , that they even adhere to a similar colour scheme as their giant , real - life counterparts			0
the orange - red brick of @entity6 's is reflected by red pieces of paper in @entity3 's model			0
@entity6 ’s is not the only cathedral @entity3 has built from paper			2
he also unveiled his take on the awe - inspiring @entity91 in the southern @entity48 town of @entity93			0
modular origami is a demanding practice and makes use of multiple pieces of paper to create more detailed and sophisticates models than would be possible using a single sheet			1
@entity3 folds each individual piece of paper into a module and attaches those together to assemble parts before adding the larger shapes together to create his spectacular models			2
but @entity3 is by no means finished building his models			0
the talented modeller is aiming to construct his own complete versions of the @entity111 and @entity112 in @entity1 to add to his astounding collection			0
the real - life version of @entity6 's , a @entity115 also known as the @entity116 , was constructed under the orders of @entity118 between 1555 and 1561			0
and another one : @entity3 managed to find the time to craft this amazing replica of the @entity91 in the @entity48 town of @entity122 the key is in the detail : the talented origami modeller occasionally disassembles his marvellous models to ensure they are true to their real - life counterparts			1

@entity3 completed his incredible modular origami models of @entity25 , @entity1
the art teacher built the replica at home in the @entity48 village of @entity18
