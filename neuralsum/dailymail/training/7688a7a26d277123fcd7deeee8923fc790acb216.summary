by @entity0 published : 11:17 est , 28 january 2013 updated : 04:12 est , 29 january 2013 more than eight million families admit their personal debts are ‘ a burden ’ as the country ’s total debt mountain balloons to nearly £ 100billion , official figures revealed yesterday			1
the report , from the @entity8 , highlights how debt problems have jumped sharply since the recession struck in 2008			1
to make matters worse , it ignores people ’s mortgages , and looks only at other types of debt such as an unpaid credit card bill , an overdraft and a personal loan			1
telling : how people feel about their debt has become more serious and stressed since the recession with eight millions families feeling it is a burden an extra 420,000 families describe their debts as either a ‘ heavy ’ burden or ‘ somewhat of a burden ’ , compared to 2006 when the same question was asked			1
overall , one in two families who have debts find them a struggle , with a large chunk of their take - home pay wiped out by paying their debts every month			0
for those who can not afford to pay off their debts , the situation gets worse and worse as the interest bill on their debts escalates rapidly			2
of the 16.3million households who have debts , it says the average debt is £ 3,200 , compared to £ 2,800 before the recession struck			1
this is the equivalent of two month ’s take - home pay for a typical worker with a full - time job earning the country ’s average salary of £ 26,000			2
stress : the average household has £ 400 more debt on items like credit cards than before the 2008 recession the @entity8 said the total debt - excluding mortgages - of households in @entity61 is £ 94.7billion , compared to £ 85.9billion before the recession began			1
the situation is most acute for people between the age of 25 and 34 , an age at which the average debt burden peaks at £ 4,300			2
for pensioners , the average is just £ 1,100			2
this is because many people are having their first child at this age , an event which pushes many into debt with a long list of extra costs from a pram to a larger home			0
to add to the pressure , many couple ’s see their earnings drop as one parent gives up work , to switch to a part - time job or they both continue to work but spend a fortune on childcare			0
dr @entity89 , @entity61 economist at the consultancy @entity90 , said : ‘ increased debt levels have been a major factor weighing down on consumer confidence			1
’ he said it has curbed people ’s ‘ willingness and ability to spend ’ with a growing list of casualties on the high - street from @entity100 to @entity101 going into administration			0
picture : says its latest survey has these findings , with the debt mountain in the @entity61 approaching £ 100bn pressure : the @entity8 says it is the poorest households that feel the intense burden of debt far more than the richest worst off : @entity112 parents with children have higher financial liabilities but lower average debt than a married couple with no children @entity118 , a director of the @entity119 , said : ‘ stagnating wages and rising living costs continue to push household budgets beyond breaking point			1
‘ the financial torture facing many households shows little sign of abating			0
’ for millions of workers , they did not lose their job during the recession but they have been hammered by the toxic combination of paltry pay rises or pay freezes and rising bills			0
a recent poll by the @entity137 said the recession had ‘ a profound impact ’ on workplaces from offices to factories			0
around 22,000 workers were quizzed about their life at work , how they are treated and how it has changed since 2008 , the year that the downturn began			0
more than one in four private sector workers have been hit by at least one annual pay cut or pay freeze , rising to 48 per cent in the public sector .			0

pressure of debt has got worse since the 2008 recession , @entity8 survey finds
@entity157 has the highest levels , @entity159 the lowest
@entity61 debt mountain now approaching £ 100bn , based on unpaid credit cards , loans and overdrafts
