by @entity0 published : 12:02 est , 13 november 2012 updated : 12:56 est , 13 november 2012 disgraced ex-cia chief @entity2 and general @entity3 both wrote letters in support of the ' unstable ' twin sister of the ' sweetheart ' sex scandal whistleblower as she battled in a bitter custody fight with her husband , it was revealed today			1
divorced mother - of - one @entity11 , 37 , lives in the same $ 1.3million house in @entity13 , @entity14 , with her sister @entity15 and cancer surgeon husband @entity16			2
it emerged today that @entity2 and @entity3 wrote letters supporting the child - custody battle between @entity11 - who was described as being ' psychologically unstable ' - and her ex-husband @entity20			1
the disclosure throws a spotlight on the judgement of the men , two of the nation 's most powerful figures in national security , as to how far they fell into the thrall of the glamorous @entity15			0
celebration : ( left to right ) @entity15 's twin sister @entity11 , gen @entity2 , @entity16 and mrs @entity15 , and @entity31 watch the @entity33 parade from the @entity15 family 's front lawn in this 2010 photo happy families : @entity11 , far left , with @entity31 , daughter @entity38 and @entity15 , right @entity41 sister : @entity11 was locked in a bitter custody battle with her husband @entity20 , right , who she was married to for only one year before their marriage started to crumble @entity20 's house in @entity47 : this is where @entity11 's estranged husband lives with their four - year - old son @entity3 is currently under investigation by the @entity54 after the agency discovered between 20,000 and 30,000 pages of communication between him and @entity15			1
if he is found to have engaged in an extramarital affair - a crime in the military - he faces being thrown out , bringing a spectacular fall from grace and the end to a glittering army career that has spanned nearly 40 years			0
meanwhile , @entity2 unknowingly filed his letter as he was simultaneously being investigated by the @entity54 after @entity15 went to them with a number of viscous emails warning her to ' back off ' and ' stay away from my guy '			2
though they were anonymous , they have since been traced back to his mistress and biographer @entity73			0
the @entity75 reported the former @entity77 chief wrote the letter just two months ago , supporting a motion to overturn a ruling made almost a year earlier by a judge			0
at this time , the judge resoundingly denied custody to @entity11 , saying he had serious concerns and reservations over her mental stability and her grasp on reality			1
he also cited her with ' outrageous conduct ' , ' bad faith litigation tactics ' , and ' illogical thinking ' before awarding full custody to the father - who had been unable to see his child for more than a year			1
according to court documents , @entity2 wrote in the september 20 letter to the @entity47 judge : ' my wife and i have known @entity11 for approximately three years , getting to know her while serving in @entity13 , @entity14 , through our friendship with @entity101 and mrs @entity102			1
' it is clear to me that [ child ’s name ] would benefit from much more time with his mother and from removal of the burdensome restrictions imposed on her when she does get to spend time with him			0
' the former @entity77 chief added that he had observed @entity11 and her son , ' including when we hosted them and the @entity15 family for @entity117 dinner this past year			1
in each case , we have seen a very loving relationship – a mother working hard to provide her son enjoyable , educational and developmental experiences '			0
scandal : gen. @entity3 , pictured before the @entity124 in march as his wife and daughter look on , is under investigation for sending ' inappropriate emails ' to a military party planner general @entity3 reportedly exchanged 20,000 to 30,000 emails with @entity15 , the woman who sparked the probe into the @entity77 boss @entity133 : @entity15 , far right , with her husband , @entity16 , and @entity31 outside the $ 1.3m house they shared with her twin sister @entity11 , who has also been dragged into the scandal from left : @entity15 with @entity38 , her mother @entity31 and twin sister @entity11 a separate letter from @entity3 , the top commander in @entity142 , dated two days later said : ' @entity11 clearly loves [ child ’s name ] and cherishes each and every opportunity she has to spend time with him			1
she is a dedicated mother			0
' in light of @entity11 ’s maturity , integrity and steadfast commitment to raising her child , i humbly request your reconsideration of the existing mandated custody settlement			1
' he said he got to observe the mother and child ' at command social functions '			0
according to the @entity75 , a judge in november 2011 gave @entity162 sole custody of the couple ’s son after finding that @entity11 , a lawyer , repeatedly lied under oath and filed false domestic - violence and child - abuse claims against her husband			1
she was also accused of defying court orders to allow her estranged husband access to their son and sent emails to his friends and colleagues telling them he was a ' horrible father and husband '			2
she was reprimanded for giving false evidence and a psychiatrist found the allegations against her ex-husband were a ' part of an ever - expanding set of sensational accusations ... that are so numerous , so extraordinary and so distorted that they defy any common - sense view of reality			0
' but @entity11 's troubles do n't just end there			1
she is also currently being sued in @entity190 for failing to pay the lawyer 's fees in her divorce - believed to be in the region of $ 100,000			1
the case has been on the court docket for nearly a-year - and - a - half but took a backward step in april when she filed for bankruptcy			2
a woman scorned ? it is being claimed that the affair between @entity2 and @entity73 emerged after she sent threatening emails to ms @entity15 successor : @entity3 last year took over from @entity2 as head of @entity205 troops in @entity142 on the bankruptcy filing , @entity11 lists $ 3.2 million in unpaid debt , plus $ 53,000 she owes the @entity208			1
earlier this year , the 37 - year - old 's former employer , prominent @entity211 lawyer @entity209 , claimed that she ' fraudulently omitted @entity212 watches , sable mink furs and a diamond ring ' from her list of assets in the april bankruptcy			1
in july of this year , @entity11 and her attorney @entity218 sued @entity209 on six counts including sexual harassment and breach of contract claims			2
she said that @entity209 owed her money and failed to properly take action when she reported a sexual harassment issue involving a financial officer doing work for the law firm			0
according to the @entity228 , @entity209 is trying to dismiss the case and is fighting back with claims of perjury and bankruptcy fraud against @entity11			2
he told the paper he has been delving into her background ever since the filing and , as well as discovering the bankruptcy documents , he found the 19 - page child custody order from the @entity47 , superior court judge calling her out in 2011 for a lengthy ' history of abusing the litigation process ' and a ' willingness to say anything , even under oath , to advance her own personal interests '			2
@entity209 said in august the lawsuit has only further inspired him to continue advocating for his own clients			0
' it takes a long time to build a good reputation , and it only takes a one accusation to tear it down , ' @entity209 said			0
' what this did was re-inspire me to protect the people i protect			0
it makes me able to better empathize when they 're falsely accused and gives me more motivation because i 've been there			0

@entity11 was described as ' psychologically unstable ' by a judge , who ordered full custody of her son be given to her ex-husband @entity20
@entity2 and @entity3 are said to have written to the judge to have this overturned
@entity11 is also being sued in @entity190 for failure to pay her lawyer 's fees
also accused of fraudulently omitting @entity212 watches , sable mink furs and a diamond ring from her list of assets in the april bankruptcy
