a coroner returned an open verdict after he heard that there was no sign given to the family of the impending tragedy and his judgement would have been impaired by alcohol			1
his father @entity27 told @entity28 : ' he lived an ordinary life , he was a very particular sort of person , he wanted to do everything correctly in the right way and that is how he went on in life until as far as we know that last moment			2
' he showed no sign of distress or anxiety at all and to this moment how this happened , and in particular why this happened , is a complete mystery to us and to the rest of his family in company with everybody who knew him			1
' it is completely indescribable what has happened and he gave no indication as to anything untoward that would lead to such a set of circumstances			0
' mr @entity1 , who was not a regular visitor to the @entity60 but worked next door , was reported missing by @entity62 on july 23 , the court heard			1
on july 24 he was seen sitting in the members bar of the @entity2 drinking wine for roughly an hour by staff before they began closing the terrace			1
friends @entity68 and @entity70 were the only other people left outside when the suited man strode up to them , climbed over the railings and fell to his death			2
ms @entity68 said she saw him take a couple of strides ' as though he was taking a run up ' before he jumped			0
she said : ' he appeared very determined , there was no way anyone could have stopped him			0
' paramedics who rushed to the scene could see it was too late to attempt resuscitation			0
the post mortem found he had 300mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood - four times the drink drive limit - which the coroner noted would have left him ' unsteady ' and with ' poor judgement '			1
awful : the 48 - year - old had been drinking wine in the art gallery 's bar for an hour before he was seen striding determinedly toward the railing and plunging off the @entity2 , pictured his wife @entity100 , who also works at @entity62 , said he was a very ' private man ' who worked hard and enjoyed his hobbies , and they had no problems or arguments and a ' good family life '			1

when she heard he was dead she was ' absolutely shocked ' and she could think of ' absolutely nothing ' which would have prompted him to jump			2
mrs @entity117 said : ' it was not in his character at all to have done something like that to himself , especially since he did n't like heights , if he went to the edge of a building he would get dizzy			0
' mr @entity1 , who had no history of mental illness , had not left a note , sent a text message or given any indication of what was about to happen			1
@entity131 : police and forensics officers are seen at the @entity2 following the death of @entity1 ' it was not in his normal character or personality that meant he would even consider disappearing then taking his own life in such a dramatic way , ' she told the court			1
