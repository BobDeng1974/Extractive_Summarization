it is inevitable that myths will swirl around an event as monumental as the richest fight of all time			2
one by one the more extravagant of those fantasies are being debunked			2
no , not the enormity of the money			2
this is a fortune which just keeps on growing and will carry on doing so all the way to the desert night of may 2 – and beyond as the pay - tv returns pour in			2
this is the latest picture @entity13 posted on shots.com as he trains for the @entity16 fight and @entity16 has also updated his @entity18 account with this picture from monday @entity20 was the only realistic option for the @entity13 - @entity16 mega-fight the $ 300million fight will be held at the @entity24 which has hosted @entity13 's last 10 bouts the latest dose of reality comes from promoter @entity28 as he explains why , despite all the speculation to the contrary , @entity13 jnr vs @entity16 was never going anywhere except @entity20			1
not to @entity33 , the preceding spiritual home of boxing			1
not to the @entity35 , where the national adoration of @entity16 could have generated a second @entity37 in @entity38 to follow in the immortal footsteps of @entity40 and @entity41			1
not to the space odyssey of a stadium which is the new home of the @entity44 , even though it would have accommodated more than five times the number of spectators lucky and wealthy enough to acquire tickets at the @entity24			2
@entity28 was glibly cited as the proponent of alternative venues			2
not least because he took his @entity16 to the house which @entity44 owner @entity52 built in @entity53 for two fights each of which pulled in 50,000 plus crowds @entity16 's promoter was cited as the proponent of alternative venues including @entity53 and @entity33 @entity28 hosted two of @entity60 's fights to the @entity44 's stadium in front of 50,000 fans ‘ not me , ’ said @entity28 as soon as @entity13 put pen to contract and he no longer had to muzzle himself for fear of jeopardising what may well become the @entity68 - dollar boxing match			1
‘ do n’t forget that i live here			2
‘ all the workers in the entertainment and gaming industries , every restaurant and bar owner and all their waiters , every hotel executive and their employees , all the cab drivers and every maintenance man ... they ’re all my neighbours			0
am i going to let them down ? am i going to disappoint or upset the folks next door ? ‘ that would have made life very difficult for me			0
but on top of that , this fight truly belongs in @entity20			1
’ that is not just sentiment			0
@entity28 is a man who deals in hard economic reality			0
@entity95 star @entity94 visits @entity16 at training camp at the @entity97 in @entity98 @entity16 talks to trainer @entity99 as he continues his training at the @entity97 he sees the numbers outside the arena – where 16,000 seats priced from $ 1,500 to $ 7,500 will treble boxing ’s gate record in @entity106 to $ 60 million			1
he see past the pay - per - view tv returns which alone could generate upwards of $ 400 million			0
he sees this single event completing the recovery of the place where he lives from the economic recession which at one point threatened the future of the gaming as well as the boxing capital of the world			2
@entity20 has still not managed to attract a @entity120 major league sports franchise but @entity28 says : ‘ this fight is three @entity122 rolled in one			1
’ he knows it is not only jobs in the short term which the richest fight of all time can secure but the medium term future of the entire city			0
every big name in show business has played the @entity20 – from @entity132 to @entity133 , from @entity134 to @entity135			1
so too the great names in boxing – from @entity40 to @entity138 , from @entity139 to @entity140 , @entity13 poses at home as he takes a break from his rigorous training regime @entity13 is training at his @entity20 gym as he bids to maintain his unbeaten record but @entity28 says : ‘ what we have here now is the biggest event in the history of @entity20			1
there will be a hundred thousand or more visitors			0
some with tickets for the fight			0
another 30,000 watching on closed circuit screens			0
others just for the experience and so they can say they were here that night			0
‘ hotel rooms are a thousand bucks a night			0
with all the high rollers you are looking at a casino drop at the tables of hundreds and hundreds of millions			0
’ @entity28 has also scotched the rumour of a re-match clause being secretly inserted into the contract ,			0
but if @entity13 - @entity60 lives up to all the hype , none of those high rollers from all over the world will bet against all concerned grasping the chance to make another half - a - billion			1
and where might @entity171 take place ? what happens in @entity20 , stays in @entity20			1
@entity175 , who thought he was going to die the night he was stabbed in @entity176 , makes what he knows to be nothing short of a miraculous ring comeback in @entity180 on saturday night			1
‘ there was blood everywhere and my whole life passed before my eyes , ’ he recalls			0
these six months after having two muscles and several arteries and tendons severed by a machete , the 28 - year - old @entity175 returns to defending not his very existence but his world welterweight championship			1
@entity175 returns to action for the first time since he was stabbed when he takes on @entity193 on saturday @entity175 meets the challenge of @entity193 for the @entity196 title he wrested from @entity197 with an outstanding away victory on @entity120 soil			1
this time he has home - town advantage at the @entity201			0
he should handle this opponent with relative comfort , on his way to a bigger test against either @entity206 or @entity208 legend @entity207 , victory in which should set up the future pay - per - view @entity211 with @entity213 for which he has been agitating			0
brook vs @entity193 will be live on @entity215 1 from 7.30 pm on saturday night .			1

@entity13 takes on @entity16 in @entity20 on may 2
