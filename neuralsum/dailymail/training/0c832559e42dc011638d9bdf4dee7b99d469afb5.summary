the outlines of a possible defense came into focus this week when it was learned that @entity3 's attorneys are trying to get access to investigative records implicating the now - dead brother in a grisly triple slaying committed in 2011			1
in court papers monday , federal prosecutors acknowledged publicly for the first time that a friend of @entity22 told investigators that @entity22 participated in the unsolved killings of three men who were found in a @entity27 apartment with their throats slit , marijuana sprinkled over their bodies			1
@entity3 ( pictured left ) is trying to be saved from the death penalty - by arguing he fell under the muderous influence of his older brother @entity22 ( right ) @entity3 's lawyers argued in court papers that any evidence of @entity22 's involvement is ' mitigating information ' that is critical as they prepare @entity3 's defense			1
they asked a judge to force prosecutors to turn over the records			0
@entity3 , 20 , faces 30 federal charges , including using a weapon of mass destruction , in the twin bombings april 15 that killed three people and injured more than 260			1

@entity67 are pictured on april 19 , 2013 , in the aftermath of the @entity70 bombing ' if i was a defense attorney and was seeking perhaps to draw attention to the influence the older brother had in planning the bombing , i would use his involvement in other crimes to show that he was likely the main perpetrator in the @entity78 bombing , ' @entity62 said			1
' i would take the position that my client , the younger brother , was strongly influenced by his older brother , and even if he is culpable , the death penalty is too extreme in this case			2
' similarly , @entity84 , who was part of the legal team that prosecuted @entity89 bombing figures @entity87 and @entity90 , said the defense may be looking to minimize the younger brother 's role in the bombing			0

one victim was a boxer and friend of @entity22 's			0
