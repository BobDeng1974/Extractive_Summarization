the improvements were so great , they did better than those in their 20s at the driving - based challenge , said researchers			1
the multi-tasking ability , memory and attention span of the men and women aged 60 to 85 were all boosted by the ‘ brain training ’ with some of the benefits still obvious six months later			1
the scientists said that their technique could be used to keep healthy older adults ‘ at the top of their game ’ for longer			0
brain training is a popular way of trying to keep the mind sharp into old age but views about its value to everyday life are mixed			2
however , the researchers at the @entity3 believe their @entity5 game is different as it was designed to improve multi-tasking , a skill known to deteriorate with age			1
players use a joystick to navigate a car along a winding road while various signs pop up			0
users must push a button when they see one particular sign while ignoring all the others			0
the game gets more difficult as a player improves but should n’t become so difficult that it is too frustrating to enjoy			0
tests showed that a small amount of practice led to rapid improvements			2
after just 12 hours of using it on a laptop at home over a month , the pensioners fared better than players who were decades younger			1
working memory and attention span also improved , despite the game not aiming to do this , reported the journal @entity63			0
dr @entity64 , who has patented @entity5 , believes it does more to train the brain than other methods like crosswords and card games			1
dr @entity64 said his game does more to train the brain than other methods like crosswords @entity72 , of @entity74 ’s memory lab , said the results should encourage people to strive to improve their mind sharp and agile throughout life			2
she said that games like @entity5 are n’t the only option – with activities such as learning a new language or taking up a musical instrument likely to be more fun and at least as beneficial			0
dr @entity85 , head of research at the @entity87 , said : ‘ the ability to improve cognitive health in old age could be crucial in the search for new treatments and preventions for dementia			0

researchers said @entity5 helps improve multi-tasking and is better than crosswords at brain - training
pensioners ' brains rejuvenated after 12 hours and got better with practice
improvements so great they did better than those in their 20s
