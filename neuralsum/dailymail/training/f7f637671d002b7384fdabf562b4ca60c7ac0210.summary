by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 does not feel @entity3 is the player he was and claims locker - room rivals are less fearful about facing the @entity5			1
their fourth - round clash at the @entity8 tomorrow should provide a real measure of where @entity3 's form is after an up - and - down first three rounds			1
the @entity5 has not faced anyone inside the top 70 , yet has already dropped sets to @entity15 and @entity16 , either side of a good performance against @entity19 in round two			1
beatable : @entity2 fancies his chances when he takes on @entity3 in the fourth round brute force : the @entity25 celebrates beating @entity26 in round three the good news for @entity3 is he will surely be back on @entity29 , a court he loves , for the @entity2 match and away from his nemesis , @entity33			1
should @entity3 win , it would be his first victory over a top - 10 player since lifting the @entity39 title last year			1
@entity2 said : " the locker room is maybe a bit less afraid of @entity3 because he 's losing a few more matches than in the past			1
but i do n't know any player who once on court is going to be super confident against @entity3			1
" he 's different than in the past maybe because i feel he 's not serving as strong as he used to , nor maybe hitting as strong as he used to			2
" and during matches he 's showing more when he seems in pain with his back or hip region , i 'm not sure			2
you can see it on some moves , too			2
" @entity3 declared himself in the best shape since before his back surgery almost a year ago when he arrived in @entity56 , and maintained that is the case despite his cramp issues in round one			1
he is no longer in pain from his back but has struggled to maintain his intensity through matches and has developed a bad habit of allowing leads to slip away			2
he was pegged back by @entity16 after looking in complete control at a set and a break up , and went on to drop the third set , but @entity3 was happy with the way he handled the lows			1
frustrated : it 's been far from plain sailing for @entity3 as he 's struggled through to the fourth round support : the @entity5 's loyal fans have stuck by him at @entity76 determined : tsonga has been knocked out in all three previous grand slams in 2014 pen to paper : tsonga signs autographs for excited fans after seeing off @entity82 " each time i had a slip , i did a decent job of getting myself back into the sets , getting a break straight away , " @entity3 said			1
" even when i got broken at the end of the match , i broke the next game			2
when i was down 4 - 1 in the third set , i got myself back into the set			1
" that 's really what you need to do			2
you need to give yourself opportunities in every set and in matches			2
then it will start to become natural again			0
" @entity3 was unable to turn things back his way the last time he met @entity2 , in @entity102 earlier this month , when from 3 - 0 up in the deciding set he allowed the match to slip away			1
it was @entity3 's first loss to @entity2 in a competitive match since the @entity107 in 2008 and he retains a dominant 9 - 2 lead in their head to head			1
" i played a good match , " said eighth seed @entity3 , looking back to the @entity102 match			1
" i was up a break in the third set and did n't manage to close it out			0
so obviously if i get myself in that position again , hopefully i 'll do a better job of that			0
but i do n't need to change too much			0
" it will be a tough match			0
we 've played each other a lot of times			0
he 's obviously playing well right now			0
he had a great week in @entity127			2
he 's played some good tennis so far here			0
" i 've had a lot of close matches with him but i 've won a lot against him , as well			0
i would say ( my game ) matches up well			0
" @entity2 had been having a poor season until @entity102 , where he beat @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 back to back to lift the second @entity140 title of his career and climb back into the top 10			1
determined : @entity3 has only lost twice to @entity2 in 11 @entity144 tour matches with @entity2 girlfriend : @entity3 's partner @entity146 has been at the @entity8 offering the @entity5 support the 29 - year - old is not reading too much into his win over @entity3 and admits the best - of - five - set format in slams does not suit him as well as best of three			1
" @entity3 is someone i know very well , against whom i do n't have a good record , " said @entity2			1
" but i 'm feeling good			0
i expect to play a good match			0
playing three sets , it 's always more physical			0
i like when it 's in three sets			0
" ( @entity102 ) is positive because it means that i 'm able to play well against him			0
i hope i will do that again			0
" one should n't overestimate this win , he still leads our head to head and now he 'll be aware of the danger and maybe it plays against me			0
" a bit as with @entity135 , he 's really tough for me because he returns very well			0
