@entity32 leaders fear mr @entity21 's left - wing @entity54 government will choose to pay its workers than its @entity13 creditors , risking a default that potentially pushes it out of the @entity56 and lands @entity57 with yet another crisis but to achieve that , @entity21 's government must make commitments in technical talks on detailed , costed measures to make public finances sustainable			1

' i think people in @entity0 should be very concerned because a suspension will have a serious impact on their football			2

that would amount to a third @entity0 bailout requiring euro zone governments ' agreement and parliamentary approval in some countries , such as @entity25 and @entity267 , which could only be achieved if there were a deal on a comprehensive reform package .			0

@entity0 could go bust next week as salaries and @entity32 debt repayments loom
