@entity0 lent down and listened to the last words of wisdom from @entity3 before the 18 - year - old made his @entity6 debut			1
' i gave you this , you have to give me a nice bottle of red wine			0
' no problem , ' the youngster replied			0
finally , with seven minutes of the 90 to play , @entity0 got his chance			2
despite all @entity3 's pre-match posturing – putting @entity20 alongside him to face the media in their press conference and arguing that they may as well shut their academy if no players came through – he only named one youth product in the entire squad to face @entity17			1
the 18 - year - old received a bad tackle from @entity41 but was helped up by his team - mates and even then , @entity20 had to make do with a place on the bench			1
they were 2 - 0 ahead by half - time			2
still he did not get the chance to play after the break			0
he finally begun warming up just after the hour mark , with @entity6 holding a comfortable 3 - 1 lead , with @entity52 and @entity53			1
still his wait went on when @entity3 made his first substitution in the 71st minute and @entity53 came on for @entity56			1
then three minutes later , @entity52 was called over by the @entity6 bench and he was thrown on			1
the teenager was left all alone , patiently jogging up and down , stretching his already well - stretched muscles			2
18 year - old @entity20 came on as a late substitute to make his senior @entity6 debut @entity20 looks to the sky after making his first - team off the bench against @entity17 eventually , after 20 minutes of warming up , he was whistled over and the wait was over			1
@entity3 put an arm on his shoulder as he crouched down to listen to the words of wisdom and instructions			2
' very good personality , very positive			0
not afraid of playing , not afraid to have the ball			0
10 minutes , but he wanted to do it			2
obviously low levels of resposibility			0
we are qualified , the result is 3 - 1 and the game is over , but he showed immediately the quality he has , ' @entity3 said after the match			1
@entity3 kept @entity20 warming up for 20 minutes before handing out instructions to the midfielder ' everyone in the stadium had the feeling we have a kid with talent			1
so keep going , keep working hard , and hopefully people around him do n't disturb the work we are doing with him			0
i said to him : ' i gave you this , you have to give me a nice bottle of red wine			0
' he said immediately : ' no problem			0
' " the 83rd minute came up on the clock and he came on for @entity105			0
quite the act to follow			0
' please welcome the @entity22 : @entity107 , ' came the announcement on the @entity109			2
there was a loud applause around the stadium			0
the first touch was shaky , giving the ball away			0
but he did not look out of place , standing at 6ft 2ins tall , amongst the others			0
the @entity6 academy product started the match on the bench during his first call - up to the senior squad he was a straight replacement for @entity105 , playing in the hole behind @entity124			1
a couple of minutes after coming on , he showed what he can do with two swift passes at either end of a @entity6 move from their own half to inside @entity17 's box			1
in 11 minutes on the pitch he stamped his mark on the match and showed he has the potential to become a first - team player			1
by the time he burst through and rounded @entity17 goalkeeper @entity139 in stoppage time , only to be flagged for offside , the supporters were cheering his name			2
in only september he was playing in @entity6 's @entity144 group stage match against @entity17 at their academy in @entity146			1
the match was played at the tiny @entity149 stadium with a capacity of 3,000 which was only a third full			0
@entity6 thumped their opponents 5 - 0			2
@entity20 tries out a trick in the warm - up at @entity22 before making his debut on wednesday he is still included in the @entity158 squad profiles on the club 's website where they describe him as ' a talented box - to - box midfielder capable of controlling games			1
' @entity3 said on tuesday : ' one month ago he played in @entity146 with the @entity164 new generation , so you can imagine the difference between playing against @entity17 academy , with 1,000 spectators , and then to play against @entity17 in the real @entity164 , at @entity22 with 45,000 and all the lights on you			1
' all the lights could be on him for many years to come .			0
