@entity1 immigrants illegally enter the @entity2 every day , often scaling 18 - foot - tall fences in the hope of finding work or , in some cases , trafficking drugs			1
but one woman picked the wrong day and the wrong place to cross over , jumping into @entity2 just a few yards away from four @entity2 senators who were visiting the @entity12 border as part of a fact - finding tour			1
@entity17 senators @entity15 and @entity18 of @entity12 , democrat @entity19 of @entity20 and @entity22 @entity21 of @entity23 were near the town of @entity25 when the illegal immigrant made her mad dash and ended up in the waiting arms of @entity29 and @entity31 officers			1
@entity15 tweeted the surprising event wednesday afternoon			2
' just witnessed a woman successfully climb an 18 - ft bollard fence a few yards from us in # @entity25 , ' he wrote			1
' @entity31 successfully apprehended her , but incident is another reminder that threats to our border security are real			1
' four @entity2 senators ( l to @entity43 ) , @entity21 , @entity15 , @entity44 and @entity18 , toured the @entity1 border and witnessed a woman jumping the border fence and entering the country illegally			1
border patrol agents meet regularly with cattle ranchers near @entity25 , @entity12 , the town whose border fence the senators visited			2
drug smugglers and ' coyotes ' who herd illegal immigrants across the border for a price , often show up on ranches before they make their way north the @entity60 estimated in 2008 that there were 11 million immigrants with no documentation living illegally in the @entity2			1
most of them crossed the border from @entity1			2
but the @entity67 reported in 2006 that an @entity12 labor union representing border patrol agents estimated that the number was somewhere between 12 million and 15 million			0
the @entity71 published data in 2010 that showed 63 percent of adult illegal immigrants had been living in the @entity2 for at least 10 years			1
president @entity74 has put political muscle behind an effort , first announced in a 2012 @entity78 speech , to mainstream illegal immigrants into @entity2 society and provide them with a path toward legal status - and , some say , citizenship			2
some @entity17 lawmakers have claimed the administration 's efforts are aimed at creating a new class of @entity90 voters who , like many african - americans after president @entity93 's @entity92 programs took effect , would show their gratitude with @entity99 loyalty			0
but @entity74 has said his initiative is more about fairness and practicality than politics			0
giving illegal immigrants some sort of legal documentation would allow federal and state government agencies to track their whereabouts , tax their earnings and get an accurate sense of ow many of them are in the country			0
conservatives counter that among the costs associated with granting legal status to illegal immigrants , the health care costs alone would put an unprecedented strain on the federal budget , driving up annual deficits post the point where new tax revenues could offset them			0
they also do n't relish the idea of rewarding unlawful behavior with what amounts to a gradual amnesty , providing new incentives for more immigrants to cross the border , or displacing @entity2 citizens from jobs that have become scarce in a down economy			0
@entity2 @entity31 agents detain thousands of illegal immigrants annually at the southern border of @entity12			1
agents @entity137 and @entity139 were photographed patrolling along the border fence at the town of @entity25 , @entity12			0
a @entity1 immigrant jumped a fence like this one wednesday as four @entity2 senators stood and watched during a fact - finding tour @entity74 described his plan in 2012 as the eventual outcome of a series of executive orders that would not need congressional approval			2
but @entity17 in @entity151 suggested they could hold up the funding required to implement those orders unless the @entity154 made a serious effort first to seal the border with @entity1			0
the four senators who visited the border wednesday are part of a larger group of lawmakers , the so - called @entity162 , who are shaping and negotiating details of an immigration reform package			0
when @entity151 reconvenes in april , that package is expected to be made public sen. @entity15 's spokesman would not comment on the episode at the @entity12 - @entity1 border beyond pointing @entity169 to the senator 's tweets			1
spokespersons for @entity173 , @entity21 and @entity19 did not respond to requests for comment .			0
