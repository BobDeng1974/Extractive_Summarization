revolution ? customers can find out about their ancestry by spitting into a tube and paying £ 125 a test to tell if you are at risk from alzheimer ’s disease and dozens of other conditions goes on sale in @entity10 today costing £ 125			1
the test uses a saliva sample to provide more than 100 pieces of genetic information including whether users are more likely than normal to suffer @entity16 ’s , some cancers or baldness			2
it can also predict whether they like coffee or hate @entity23 sprouts , which type of exercise is likely to suit them best and give information about a person ’s ancestry			1
the test , already available in the @entity31 , is being marketed online by @entity32 , a firm part - funded by @entity33			1
a customer spits into a tube , seals it and sends it back to @entity32 ’s labs for analysis			1
four to six weeks later , they receive a detailed report in the post written in everyday language			1
it will tell them , for instance , whether their risk of @entity50 ’s disease is higher or lower than average			0
@entity32 – run by @entity52 , wife of @entity33 co-founder @entity53 – says its ‘ mission is to ensure that individuals can personally access , understand and benefit from the human genome ’			1
it says that armed with the information , people can take better care of their health			0
for instance , the print - out may give someone the impetus they need to give up smoking or it could mean they undergo regular health checks so that an illness can be caught – and treated early			1
genetic tests are already available in @entity10 but generally provide less information and are more expensive			0
however , critics say the science behind such analysis is not is not advanced enough to provide worthwhile results			1
this could lead to some people being falsely reassured , others worrying unnecessarily or facing higher insurance premiums and the @entity84 being put under added pressure			0
genome : tests on @entity88 are also available in @entity10 , but provide less information and are more expensive the firm has been banned from providing some information from the tests to customers in the @entity31 over fears it would lead to people seeking out treatment they do not need			1
the @entity31 health watchdog , the @entity97 , was particularly concerned about information provided on one gene , @entity100 , that raises the odds of breast and ovarian cancer			1
it said : ‘ for instance , if the brca - related risk assessment for breast or ovarian cancer reports a false positive , it could lead a patient to undergo prophylactic surgery , chemoprevention , intensive screening , or other morbidity - inducing actions , while a false negative could result in a failure to recognise an actual risk that may exist			2
’ there are also concerns that someone told they have a higher risk of an incurable condition such as @entity50 ’s may take a fatalistic approach and stop looking after their health			0
@entity125 of @entity126 said : ‘ for better or worse , genetic testing companies are here to stay ' professor @entity128 , an expert in cancer genetics from @entity130 in @entity131 , said dna analysis is ‘ very open to misunderstanding ’			2
she warned that the results could cause ‘ undue and inappropriate anxiety ’ and said that valuable @entity84 time could be taken up by people requesting further tests			0
@entity125 , professor of evolutionary genetics at @entity126 , said : ‘ for better or worse , direct - to - the - consumer genetic testing companies are here to stay			2
' one could argue the rights and wrongs of such companies existing , but i suspect that ship has sailed			0
@entity32 have enormous resources and leading scientists on their advisory board			0
‘ nonetheless , it is important that independent scientists and government bodies remain vigilant to ensure that such companies produce scientifically accurate , responsibly formatted and non-alarmist reports to their customers			2
’ @entity32 already has some @entity10 users and says most find the information ‘ extremely valuable ’			0
only 4 per cent have made an appointment with their doctor based on the results or asked for further tests			0
the firm says it has spoken to the @entity162 to ensure its test complies with @entity10 regulations .			0

@entity166 is part - funded by @entity33 and is already *widely* available in the @entity31
customers spit in tube , send it to lab and receive report a month later
it claims to judge what type of exercise is best and give ancestry details
but critics say such analysis is not advanced enough to be worthwhile
