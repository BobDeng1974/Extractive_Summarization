with @entity3 set to return to @entity4 with @entity5 , @entity2 season - ticket holder @entity0 explains why his legacy at the @entity7 is tarnished			1
@entity2 vs @entity5 is the biggest game of the season by a mile , it could easily decide the destination of the league title			1
@entity3 has won these sort of games for @entity2 countless times - i ca n’t believe he ’ll be lining up against us			1
on september 21 last year , around 3000 @entity2 fans , including myself , made the trip up north for what was already billed as a title showdown at the @entity23			1
when @entity26 opened the scoring for the @entity7 , and with @entity5 then reduced to 10 men , most of us thought we ’d see a repeat of the win from last season			2
then @entity3 came on … @entity3 acknowledged the crowd but did n't celebrate after scoring for @entity5 against @entity2 it was a typical @entity3 goal - arriving in the box at the perfect time to finish things off saturday 's match will be another reunion for @entity3 and his former @entity2 captain @entity40 what an ovation he received after leaving the club after 13 years almost through the back door at the end of last season			1
@entity3 had just scored against @entity2			1
our all - time record goalscorer had just dented our title hopes with one felled swoop of his right boot			0
‘ who scored ? it was n’t @entity3 was it ? ’ that ’s all i remember			2
on a personal level , this was up there with @entity40 ’s slip in @entity60 and @entity62 ’s last minute winner at @entity63			0
granted that will be met with some ridicule , but this is my childhood hero			0
the long walk back to @entity69 was met with cries and jeers of ‘ super @entity72 ’ from the @entity5 faithful			2
that ’s when it started to turn a bit sour			0
the weeks went on and with that came the goals			0
a crucial strike against @entity80 with @entity5 down to 10 and a @entity82 winner at @entity83 spring to mind			2
@entity3 had certainly split the opinion of the @entity2 fans			1
with time passing , surely it was about time @entity3 left to @entity89 ? he ’d done his bit for @entity5 but we ’d been told that was that			1
he ’s staying to the end of the season and the news of the deal had come out			2
we ’d been sold a dud and that really hurt			0
@entity3 , who supposedly said he ’d never play for another @entity100 team , had not only gone against his word , but had joined our main title rivals			2
@entity3 will again line up for @entity5 against the side he played for most of his career for @entity3 's last goal for @entity2 came against @entity106 in april last year - but he was n't offered a new contract that ’s the key here - title rivals			1
no , @entity2 and @entity5 do n’t have much of a traditional rivalry ; @entity3 had n’t joined @entity111 or @entity112 , even @entity113 or @entity114 , but he had gone to the one team who have a genuine chance of scuppering what could be our first title in five years			1
all this leaves one hell of a bitter taste in the mouth for someone who should have left on an almighty high as the greatest ever to wear the @entity126			0
with that in mind , it does n’t change what @entity3 has done for @entity2 ; three @entity132 titles , captaining the side to their first @entity135 trophy , four @entity136 , two @entity137 , a @entity139 crown - the honours of a true legend , a legend who should , in theory , be receiving the same reception that @entity145 got on his return with @entity147 last season			1
but , unfortunately , the issue has divided the support like no other and no - one quite knows what tomorrow will bring			0
i certainly will not be singing his name			0
i wo n’t boo him either , but we all know @entity3 is the model professional and will be out to beat us in the biggest game of the season			2
if the unfathomable happens and he scores the winner , i can not imagine what will transpire			0
it ’s an inconceivable outcome that would possibly tarnish his reputation with even the most ardent of supporters			0
i think we ’d all like to see this debacle over and done with as soon as possible			0
once @entity3 spends a few years lifting titles in the @entity168 - another continent on which he ’ll win more than ‘ @entity170 ’ - he ’d be more than welcome back to the @entity4 as a member of staff , a club ambassador or even a ball boy			1
but please , @entity3 , do n’t make this harder than it already is .			0
