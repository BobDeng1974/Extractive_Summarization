as international trade and tourism has grown in @entity2 so too has the need for @entity5 signs			0
but while the @entity9 are known for their love of learning @entity5 , some of their translators need to go back to the classroom			1
from ' fresh crap ' to ' horny care ' , @entity13 travellers in the country are often left lost for words by the bizarre messages on some signs			2
strange : this parking sign could lead to embarrassing misunderstandings between drivers with its bizarre message keep out : a mix - up at the sign - writer 's makes this tourist attraction seem less than welcoming warning : @entity5 speaking visitors are warned not to tread on ' smiling ' lawn in this odd message a collection of some of the humorous signs spotted around the country were posted on @entity2			1
in some cases the amusing errors were caused by misinterpreting the @entity9 characters , such as the peculiar advertisement in a supermarket aisle for ' a time sex thing '			2
this was caused because the characters for ' disposable products ' can also mean ' one ' and ' sex ' when read separately			0
special offer : this @entity9 supermarket is left tongue - tied over its offer of disposable goods catch of the day : a misplaced letter at a fishmonger 's makes the carp look less than appetising mixed messages : this spa is offering horny care alongside its more traditional treatments recipe for disaster : this menu translator will be left red - faced over this crude interpretation of a duck dish similarly , the @entity9 character for ' dry ' can sometimes be pronounced as ' f * * * ' , leading to the unfortunate menu item ' f * * * the duck until exploded '			1
the mistake was repeated at other restaurants as well a shop offering dried goods			0
other errors however , such as ' racist park ' are caused by misunderstanding the meaning of the word			0
the sign in this case should have read ' ethnic museum '			0
odd : wine drinkers appear to be warned off throwing their glasses in this sign customer service : this sign in a changing room left a holiday - maker baffled as to what the store was offering cakes : this garbled sign in a restaurant window in @entity91 is just about legible for foreign visitors language barrier : the owners of this restaurant need to hire a better translator other signs that have brought a smile to travellers in the region include a cash point that offers to ' recycle currency ' and a bank receipt offering ' male service '			1
and the intriguing sign spotted in a store changing room telling customers ' do n't touch yourself ' is likely to have been a misplaced , but well - meaning offer to help fit clothes			1
sometimes the signs are just the product of sloppy work , such as the misplaced letter at a fishmonger making the carp on offer less appealing , in some cases however , the real meaning of the translator 's work will remain hidden , such as the spa offering ' horny care ' alongside more traditional treatments			2
and while their work may not be up to scratch , the translators have brightened many travellers ' days with their amusing take on the @entity5 language			0
money laundering : this cash point offers to recycle money for green - minded travellers @entity134 : this road warning sign is a comedy of errors following a mistake in translation offer : a sign in @entity9 and @entity5 indicates a room or hotel for foreigners in @entity146			1
how many people took up the offer is unclear however			0

odd signs leave *westerners* baffled as to true meaning
@entity9 sign - writers left tongue - tied by translations
some signs could lead to embarrassing misunderstandings
