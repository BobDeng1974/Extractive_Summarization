the @entity2 / @entity1 scandal has been reignited			1
in the days leading up to the @entity4 poll , a social media campaign to have @entity7 pop artist @entity2 ’s song shake it off win the poll stole the spotlight			1
on the morning of the national countdown , @entity10 announced @entity12 was disqualified from the countdown , largely because it had never been played on the station			1
but news has surfaced that the ninth - placed song on the countdown , @entity18 , by @entity20 artist @entity19 , also had never been played on the youth broadcaster either , reports @entity22			1
@entity39 , @entity10 ’s station manager , told @entity35 def the song had been played on the station 's @entity41 shows @entity43 and @entity44			2
" @entity10 has been playing @entity19 for more than 15 years , since she was a young artist in @entity46 ... we played 4 - 5 songs from her 1000 @entity49 album on @entity10 in 2014 , " he said			2
he pointed out that by comparison , none of @entity52 songs had been played on the station			0
there have been previous examples of songs appearing on the poll without ever being played , including @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and the @entity62			0
me over ( featuring @entity64 ) in fifth spot			0
@entity66 took the top position with his song talk is @entity69			0
@entity71 ( featuring @entity72 ) 3			0
@entity71 - take me over ( featuring @entity77 ) 6			0
@entity79 - @entity78 ( featuring @entity80 ) 7			0
@entity19 - @entity18 @entity82 and @entity83 on the morning of the countdown , there was a drum roll and @entity10 's @entity87 announced that @entity2 will not be appearing in this year ’s list ‘ for a whole range of reasons ’			1
an article with a comprehensive explanation for the decision was put on the @entity10 website , but very few are privy to this information as the website crashed just a minute after it was posted			1
@entity98 viewed the post which is titled ' eight hilarious but totally true reasons you did n't hear @entity2 in the @entity1 '			2
the humorous article , laden with sarcasm , has copied the format of the website ' @entity105 ' which lead the # tay4hottest100 campaign			1
' their # @entity110 campaign bought @entity2 a one - way ticket to bansville , ' a @entity10 author wrote			1
although they did wish to clarify , ' triple j does n't have beef with @entity2			2
' ' she 's smart , she 's cool and she has excellent taste in @entity117 , ' in reference to @entity2 's friendship with @entity120 , who made numerous appearances in last year 's @entity1 countdown			1
before the music countdown began , there was a drum roll and @entity10 's @entity87 announced that @entity2 will not be appearing in this year ’s list ‘ for a whole range of reasons ’ the @entity10 author explains that they took issue with the fact @entity105 , an international media company worth $ 850 million and the allegedly the leading source of cat gifs , was ' throwing their weight around to influence a publicly voted music poll '			2
' it 's not legit for other media to try and troll the poll , ' @entity10 wrote			0
@entity10 has strict rules which promise to ' remove artists from the list who have benefited from competitions or commercial campaigns that incentivise fans to vote for them '			0
the article then points out the number of ' trolls ' who voted for @entity2 to ' prod the hipsters for lulz ' , meaning they did not vote for the young muso because of a genuine interest in the countdown			1
' do we really want to be talking about this every year ? ' @entity10 asked			0
they argue that if the @entity2 campaign was successful it would have a long - term impact on their music poll , with other campaigns inevitably set to follow in future years , supporting people like ' @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 '			0
that would be a ' sh * * * y , sh * * * y tragedy			0
' @entity29 were also pointed out as being partially responsible for their decision after the fast food chain launched a campaign endorsing the pop icon in the lead up to the annual @entity4 countdown			1
' not every @entity29 idea is a good one , ' pointed out @entity10 in their ' @entity182 ' post			2
the fast food giant jumped on the frenzied social media attempt to include the starlet in the @entity1 , a campaign which has sparked both waves of support and fury from polarised music lovers			1
the fast food chain offered a $ 19.89 voucher , in reference to the pop star 's latest album 1989 , to customers who posted their favourite @entity2 song - a move which may breach the countdown 's strict policy of banning artists who give their fans incentives to vote			1
' " we 'd prefer that people vote for the love of music , not the love of cholesterol " , ' @entity10 responded on @entity4 , hitting out at the fast food chain after they tried to cash in on the @entity1 hype			1
an article with a comprehensive explanation for the decision was put on the @entity10 website , but very few are privy to this information as the website crashed just a minute after it was posted @entity10 confirmed that the voucher was in direct violation of the @entity1 voting rules , which clearly state that the station will ' remove artists from the list who have benefited from competitions or commercial campaigns that incentivise fans to vote for them '			1
following the announcment , @entity226 was bombarded with posts – some celebrating the decision , others devastated by @entity2 ’s exclusion			0
‘ dear @ triplej why do you hate joy and puppies and kittens and bubbles and good things you monsters , ’ wrote @entity232			0
‘ is it too cliche to tell @ taylorswift13 fans to shake it off ? ’ said @entity241 - @entity240 ‘ now the people who were waiting for @entity2 , but have never listened to @ triplej can go away now , ’ said @entity245			0
almost in direct response , @entity247 posted ‘ so , @ triplej just ensured i wo n't be listening to any of the # hottest100 this year by not including # taylorswift			0
’ @entity251 : in retaliation , extreme alternative music fans with a penchant for violent threats then took to social media to intimidate @entity2 supporters earlier on tuesday , an unofficial poll shed some insight into who might take home the coveted @entity1 crown , with @entity2 making the cut despite the controversy			2
@entity2 was given a number 75 ranking on the @entity267 which has proved an inaccurate prediction , many hipsters nationwide may well hurl into fits of rage come @entity4 when the @entity10 station 's annual alternative music poll hits the airwaves			1
nasty : ' i hope you die a slow , painful death , ' one wrote to a voter , while another compared a fan to @entity281 too cool for school : the campaign to get @entity2 on the list kicked off after super fan @entity285 tweeted @entity10 boss @entity286 ( pictured ) about the omission of @entity2 's hit shake it off from the voting list			2

number nine on the countdown , @entity18 , had never been played by @entity10
@entity2 was disqualified largely because her song had never been played by the station
a viral campaign *encouraged* *members* of the public to vote for @entity2 so she could top the @entity4 countdown
the triple j website crashed a minute after an article explaining the decision was posted
@entity29 jumped on the # tay4hottest100 campaign to include @entity2 in the annual triple j @entity1 countdown
former triple j *presenter* @entity311 said @entity2 had been excluded based on ' a fast food chain be involved in the process '
