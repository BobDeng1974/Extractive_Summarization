by @entity0 published : 16:52 est , 16 january 2014 updated : 06:40 est , 17 january 2014 the wife of the 49ers coach @entity3 called a local radio station to give her two cents on the topic of the day : what kind of wife would let her husband wear the same terrible outfit - a tucked - in black sweatshirt and pleated khakis belted high on the waist - every sunday ? @entity13 told @entity14 and @entity15 that she has spent years trying to talk her husband out of his signature @entity17 khakis , even throwing them in the bin , to no avail			1
' i 've told him so many times : that outfit reflects on me ! ' she said			1
uniform : @entity3 can be seen in a variation of this outfit on the sidelines of every game his team , the 49ers , plays - much to the chagrin of his wife married to his style : @entity13 ( right ) told the radio station that she has tried to change her husband 's ways , even throwing out the offending pants , but ' he just does n't care ' @entity39 and @entity15 were using @entity3 's sartorial setbacks as a launching pad for listeners to call in with their own significant other 's clothing conundrums			1
' is this really @entity13 ? ' asks one of the presenters			2
and not many things make me want to call in to a radio station , ' she says laughing			1
' but my friend called me this morning ... i will not			2
i will not take the blame for his outfits			0
' mrs @entity13 explains that she has tried to influence her husbands fashion choices , but ' he just does n't care			0
' ' he 's got a flattering body , ' she adds , saying that she wants him in flat - front pants			1
bargain hunter : according to his wife , @entity3 spends just $ 8 per pair on the pleated - front khakis he is so fond of @entity3 was pictured buying new khakis at a @entity17 in @entity67 such is his attachment to the pleated pants that after she disposed of one pair , he stopped on his way to the @entity73 to pick up a new pair			1
' it 's not just any store , ' she told the radio jocks			2
' you have to find them at a @entity17			0
eight dollars ! ' she laments			0
she says she told her husband that he was aging himself and that he ' looks like @entity83 , ' to the amusement of @entity15 and @entity39			0
stopping just short of calling her husband superstitious , she says that at this point in the season she knows he ca n't change his outfit			0
but mrs @entity13 said she 'd spoken to her husband and asked him if after the final he would let her - or someone else - dress him , and he had agreed			1
according to @entity91 , @entity3 is aware of the morning radio discussion			1
' i heard they were making quite a bit of sport of me , ' he said			0
' happy wife , happy life			0
' he reportedly stocked up on some new pants wednesday , but is n't quite ready to trade in his tucked - in sweatshirt			2
' if i 'm the last person who tucks in his shirt , that will be great , ' he said			0
' i 'll feel like an innovator			0
' he was snapped by a fan in @entity17 - where else - buying several pairs of flat - front @entity110 , for which he paid ' $ 23 a pair , on sale			1
