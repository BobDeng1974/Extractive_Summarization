by @entity0 climate science has been transformed by huge computer simulations that can predict changes in lands , oceans and atmospheres			0
now researchers are hoping they can do the same for ecology by creating an ambitious model that simulates entire ecosystems , anywhere in the world			2
researchers at @entity14 and the @entity15 are hoping the model could provide a better understanding of how the planet 's fragile ecosystems fit together			2
it reveals that the oceans hold more creatures than on land , and their numbers are affected by the changing seasons dubbed the @entity35 model , the simulation captures the growth , migration and lives of creatures as their food chain			1
ecologists have spent the past two years developing the simulation which uses real data on changes in , for instance , animal migration			1
they hope it will eventually lead to something known as ‘ @entity49 ’ , or @entity50 , to capture the entire structure and function of any ecosystem in the world			0
this graph from the simulation shows how human hunting can lead to a sudden collapse in carnivore numbers the @entity60 model captures the broad structure and function of ecosystems around the world			1
it does this by simulating processes - including feeding , reproduction and death - that drive the distribution of creatures			1
ecologists and biologists have spent the past two years developing the open source simulation , which uses real data on carbon flows as a starting point			1
from the relationship between the mass of individual organisms and how long they live , to the distribution of biomass across @entity87 , the model 's outputs are broadly consistent with current understanding of ecosystems			2
the @entity35 model could radically improve understanding of the biosphere and help inform policy decisions about biodiversity and conservation			2
@entity99 to @entity98 savannas , for instance , gems could be used to model the total biomass of all plants , the grazing animals that feed on them and the carnivores that feed on the grazers			2
this would map the flows of energy and nutrients within the food chain over time			0
using the model , ecologists could explore how these measures of health might change in response , for example , to climate change or poaching			1
‘ as recently as five years ago people were saying it would be impossible to build a global ecosystem model because there were too many complexities and uncertainties , ’ @entity119 , head of the @entity121 lab told the @entity122			0
‘ but now we have done it , and we are about to publish scientific papers giving our results			0
’ modelling every organism within an ecosystem is impossible as it would require too much computing power			0
but the researchers say they can obtain valid results by applying rules about the way creatures behave in groups			0
‘ the @entity141 could help address key environmental issues , in particular , the effects of human pressures such as habitat loss , ’ the researchers write on their website			1
the current version is a prototype designed to encourage other scientists to become involved in the project			1
‘ we are releasing the model as open source code , allowing anyone to inspect the current version of the model or develop it further , ’ said the researchers			1
the model , however , has so far proved controversial			0
some ecologists believe that nature is simply too complex to model in this way			1
others argues that the outputs from the models are too uncertain to be the basis of important decisions , such as where to place protected areas or how best to run fisheries			0
but the creators of the @entity141 believe that ecologists must at least try to model ecosystems , if we are to understand and ultimately save them			2
‘ the model is likely to throw up new scientific questions that were not evident before it was built , ’ they said			0
@entity99 to @entity98 savannas , the simulation could be used to model the total biomass of all plants , the grazing animals that feed on them and the carnivores that feed on the grazers			0

@entity60 model captures the growth , migration , and lives of creatures
it could address environmental issues such as hunting and habitat loss
*software* is open - source to encourage more scientists to get involved
but some ecologists believe nature is too complex to model in this way
