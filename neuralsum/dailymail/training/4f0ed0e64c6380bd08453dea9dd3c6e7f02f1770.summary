here @entity110 look at five key issues he needs to address to ensure they beat the drop			0
@entity114 despite picking up their first win on the road against @entity20 last time out , the previous 11 matches did not yield a single point for @entity2			1
with @entity34 , @entity36 and @entity40 still to come to @entity121 , their away form could be the key to ensuring their @entity9 survival			2
@entity124 rangers have the joint worst defensive record in the league and , with goals also at a premium , tightening up at the back is a must			0
@entity54 failed to identify his preferred central defensive partnership so finding a system that gets the best out of @entity135 and @entity136 could make the difference			2
share the goals @entity139 has contributed 50 per cent of @entity2 's goals in the @entity9 and that form has rightly led to talk of a potential @entity144 call - up			1
but @entity0 will be looking for someone else to help shoulder the scoring burden , especially with the former @entity148 man not having scored in open play since the december win over @entity39			2
@entity151 @entity69 down this may be easier said than done , with the combative midfielder becoming the first player in @entity9 history to be cautioned in seven consecutive matches			2
@entity69 's leadership qualities and never - say - die attitude are far more beneficial on the field than off it , so avoiding suspensions is crucial			0
integrate a squad of egos @entity69 , @entity85 , @entity135			0
none of the three are afraid to speak their minds and they are not the only squad members with chequered pasts			0
@entity87 and @entity86 have also had high - profile disagreements with managers and @entity0 will need to forge a team ethos to stand any chance of survival .			0

@entity0 has been named as successor to @entity54
the @entity2 players have been impressed with the quality of his coaching
@entity0 led the club to their first away win of the season at @entity20
@entity2 are 17th in the @entity9 table , just outside the relegation zone
