@entity0 , 33 , has been convicted of suffocating her newborn baby daughter a mother - of - five today avoided jail for suffocating her newborn baby daughter by stuffing toilet paper down her throat and hiding the infant 's body in a suitcase			1
@entity9 , 33 , wept as she walked free after a judge accepted she had a ' momentary abnormality of mental functioning ' which she no longer suffered from			1
a court heard she was suffering from a condition known as a ' pathological denial of pregnancy ' which continued after giving birth to a baby girl			1
until that point she had managed to keep her pregnancy secret from her family and gave birth to the child in the bath before killing her			0
she ' intended ' to dispose of the tragic baby 's body unnoticed , wrapping it in a plastic bag and towels , but was prevented from doing so when paramedics arrived and whisked her off to hospital			1
earlier that evening she had complained to her family of a bad back but an ambulance was called when it was noticed she had wrapped herself in blood - soaked towels			1
before she left her sister 's home in @entity38 , @entity39 , on september 12 last year , she was seen rearranging items in a suitcase and placed items on top			1
three days later , her sister , @entity45 , complained of a smell coming from @entity48 ' bedroom and traced it to the suitcase , @entity44 heard			0
when she opened it she found towels soaked in blood and the body of a baby girl , which was between 35 and 36 weeks gestation			1
@entity48 was cleared of murder but convicted of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility			1
mr @entity61 , sentencing @entity62 at @entity64 , @entity65 , to a two year community order with supervision requirements , described her actions as ' wholly out of character '			1
he said : ' on september 12 last year you gave birth to a baby girl and very shortly afterwards you killed that baby by inserting tissue paper in her mouth			1
a court heard @entity9 ( pictured ) was suffering from a condition known as a ' pathological denial of pregnancy ' ' immediately thereafter you hid the baby in a suitcase and it was not discovered for three days			1
' the explanation for your conduct is you were suffering from an abnormality of mental functioning which substantially impaired your judgement			1
' this arose from a medical condition known as a pathological denial of pregnancy which continued despite the obvious presence of a baby			2
' the giving of birth did n't bring the denial to an end and you continued to deny the pregnancy to your family , friends and medical personnel			0
' it was a great shock to you and induced in you a state of panic			0
' your actions of killing the baby were a manifestation of your irrational condition and your actions were wholly out of character			2
' he added that her friends provided glowing references of her childcare qualities which were in ' stark contrast ' to her actions on september 12 last year			2
@entity48 ( pictured ) was cleared of murder but convicted of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility he continued : ' quite why you developed a pathological denial of pregnancy is unclear but it 's likely to be you living with the pressures of living with two children in cramped conditions without a partner in a foreign country and unable to speak @entity130 without any prospect of a job			1
' the family of @entity48 , who is originally from @entity135 but a @entity137 national , will arrange accommodation for her supervision , the court heard			0
the conditions of the order mean she must report to her probation officer on a regular basis to help her rehabilitation into society			0
when she killed her baby daughter she was living at the shared property in @entity38 with eight other people including her sister			1
however , she can no longer live with her sister because social services will take her four children away into care if they live under the same roof			0
during the trial @entity154 , prosecuting , told how @entity48 concealed her pregnancy from her friends and family and denied giving birth altogether , saying she simply had a period			0
@entity48 avoided jail and was sentenced to a two year community order with supervision requirements when she appeared at @entity64 ( pictured ) he said : ' she placed the body of the baby in a suitcase , hidden from anyone			1
' no doubt , we suggest she intended to dispose of it but was prevented from doing so by the arrival of the paramedics , who took her off to hospital			0
' following the discovery of the baby 's body police were called and officers arrested @entity48 on september 15 , the day after she was discharged from hospital			2
in police interviews on september 17 she claimed she was in the bath because her back and legs hurt when the baby suddenly came out			2
she said she caught the baby but it was n't crying or moving			2
however , dr @entity188 carried out a post mortem examination on september 17 and could not find any evidence that the baby was stillborn			2
he added he believed that the wad of tissue paper , made up of around five pieces , was deliberately inserted , a court heard			0
mr @entity196 added : ' it is also dr @entity199 's view that the obstruction of the baby 's airways by this object would have caused its death if the baby had been born alive			0
' in mitigation , @entity206 said : ' here we have a vulnerable defendant being held in custody and in my respectful submission she should not be there			0
' given the circumstances of this case and the jury 's finding the court could impose a sentence that results in her immediate release			0
' @entity48 has already served eight months in custody following her arrest in september last year which mr @entity61 took into account when sentencing			0
speaking after the verdict , senior investigating officer det insp @entity225 said : ' the death of a baby is always a tragedy but the unique circumstances make this a particularly emotive case for everyone involved			0
' our thoughts are very much with the victim 's wider family as they are struggling to comprehend how and why this tragedy happened			0
