after upsetting the odds one week , it ’s always good to back it up the following one — and @entity4 managed that yesterday as they escaped south @entity5 with a point			1
@entity7 are n’t in the class of @entity9 , who @entity4 beat last saturday , but they defended stoutly , worked as a unit and forced @entity14 ’s side into areas they did not wish to be			1
at times the @entity17 could n’t live with their hosts , or more pointedly with @entity19 , who gave @entity20 a real chasing			1
the barometer for @entity4 is not how they fare against the likes of the @entity91 in the @entity92 but on awkward trips such as this			1
they passed the test , just			0
‘ we have to be reasonably pleased with an away point , ’ @entity14 said			1
‘ last week was fantastic , but credit to @entity7 , they asked questions of us			2
the pitch was n’t great and we would like to have produced more			0
’ @entity19 shone brightly , coping well with the hype around him			2
@entity34 drew another smart save from @entity58 with a curling effort from outside the box as he produced a display more reminiscent of his @entity107 days under @entity108			2
‘ it was good for @entity34 to get a goal — we need more from other areas			1
he complements the set - up and helps @entity19 , ’ @entity82 said			2
@entity42 runs over to celebrate with @entity34 , @entity19 , @entity47 and @entity35 after his side go in the lead @entity34 is congratulated by @entity7 captain @entity116 after scoring the opening goal of the match @entity19 was the one to catch the eye			1
the 25 - year - old admits he needs to be more productive — chiefly to chip in with extra goals — but his manager was delighted with his directness and his final ball here			0
@entity19 ’s crosses are certainly hitting the mark on a more regular basis			2
he should be off to the @entity128 next month with @entity129 and @entity7 are sure to miss him			2
for now , there are games to be won and @entity19 is the man to secure results			0
@entity82 is n’t worried about suitors in next month ’s transfer window			0
‘ it does n’t matter how much anyone offers us , ’ he said			0
‘ he wo n’t be going anywhere in january			0
’ it did n’t take him long to make a telling contribution			0
after 11 minutes , he sauntered down the left and flighted a cross for @entity34 to flick home			0
the unusually quiet @entity28 crowd rose from their slumber , but only briefly			0
@entity4 were level just over a minute later			1
@entity63 was n’t picked up and his blocked effort found its way to the inexplicably unmarked @entity24 — standing to attention at the back post — who did the rest			0
the gangly striker might have won it with only moments remaining but could n’t get enough power into his volley			0
@entity82 ’s side enjoyed the best of it , @entity4 seemingly out of sorts and incapable of dealing with @entity19 ’s pace and trickery			1
@entity34 had the taste for more , stinging @entity58 ’s palms after a clever reverse pass from the left winger , while @entity36 ’s low shot almost crept inside a post			1
crouch wheels away in celebration after scoring his fourth @entity172 goal of the season @entity42 competes for the ball with @entity4 's @entity175 during the @entity172 clash at @entity28 @entity7 manager @entity82 applauds the home fans during his side 's match against @entity4 @entity49 challenges @entity175 for the ball during the encounter between @entity7 and @entity4 @entity4 's @entity60 controls the ball while @entity49 attempts to close his opponent down @entity58 barks out instructions to his @entity4 team - mates as his side went in search of a winning goal @entity19 goes on a marauding run down the wing while @entity65 gives chase @entity4 centre back @entity59 challenges @entity34 in an attempt to win back the ball @entity29 attempts to win back possession for his side while @entity49 gets the ball under control @entity4 's @entity63 and @entity34 of @entity7 battle for the ball in the middle of the park @entity14 watches on as @entity64 is replaced by @entity65 ( left ) while @entity20 and @entity19 go up for an aerial challenge ( right ) @entity7 and @entity4 shared the spoils as both sides were unable to grab a winner during the second half @entity207 acknowledges the travelling away support after the final whistle @entity82 and @entity14 shake hands after watching their sides play out a 1 - 1 draw in south @entity5			1

@entity34 scored his first goal since *joining* @entity7 in the *summer* against @entity14 ' @entity4
@entity24 levelled the scoring just two minute later by scoring past @entity41 at @entity28
@entity19 impressed for @entity7 once again but the winger was unable to help his side find a winner
