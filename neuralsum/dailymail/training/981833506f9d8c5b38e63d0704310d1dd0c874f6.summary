@entity0 proved he is unwilling to allow @entity1 to ride roughshod all over him by turning in a dominant day of practice ahead of sunday 's @entity4 @entity3			1
after emerging from a controversial race in @entity6 where he and @entity8 team - mate @entity1 collided with a season - high 29 - point lead , @entity0 has been on the receiving end of a backlash from the @entity12			1
five successive victories have allowed @entity1 to turn the tables on @entity0 and open up a 24 - point cushion to the @entity16 with two grands prix remaining , at @entity18 on sunday and @entity19 on november 23			1
@entity1 , winner at the last five races , takes a trip off track as he aimed to reel in @entity0 @entity1 finished behind @entity8 team - mate @entity0 in both practice sessions on friday 1			1
@entity43 @entity0 , however , showed he is far from finished as he topped the timesheet at the end of both 90 - minute sessions , initially on the medium - compound tyre in the morning and then soft rubber in the afternoon			0
@entity0 's best time of the day was a one minute 12.123secs for one of the most - renowned circuits in @entity52 , with @entity1 just over two tenths of a second adrift - the same for both sessions			2
for once , it was @entity24 in his @entity56 - rather than team - mate @entity29 as has often been the case - emerging the best of the rest , with the @entity60 just over half a second adrift			1
as for @entity29 , his session came to a premature end when his car burst into flames after he had pulled off the circuit , initially with smoke billowing from the rear of his car			0
@entity29 finished down in seventh come the conclusion to the day , 0.999secs off of @entity0 's pace			2
in between the @entity56 duo were @entity25 in his @entity26 and @entity28 pair @entity27 and @entity28 , the latter on home soil and finishing 0.976secs adrift			2
@entity31 's @entity30 was next up , followed by @entity32 in his @entity26 and @entity33 's @entity34 to round out the top 10			0
@entity41 took to the track for the second practice session after failing to post a competitive time in @entity81 @entity0 , 24 points adrift of @entity8 team - mate @entity1 , set the pace in both sessions on friday @entity32 ( right ) and @entity1 jostle for track position during the second practice session as for @entity41 , the veteran was down in 16th in his @entity33 , just over two seconds back following a frustrating day			1
in @entity87 @entity41 suffered an @entity88 ( energy recovery store ) failure at the end of his installation lap that kept him in the garage for the rest of the session			0
if @entity41 thought he had problems , though , then he perhaps spared a thought for @entity99 's @entity98 who failed to turn a wheel in anger all day			0
in giving way to @entity105 in @entity81 , the @entity103 crashed the car to such an extent that repairs were impossible in order to allow @entity98 to get out on track in @entity111 .			0

@entity0 **fastest** in both sessions ahead of @entity8 team - mate @entity1
the @entity16 is *bidding* to *overturn* a 24 - point *deficit* with two races left

@entity29 's @entity56 caught fire and the session was red *flagged*
