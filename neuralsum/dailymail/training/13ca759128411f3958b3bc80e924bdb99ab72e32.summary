a four - year - old child broke protocol and sat down in front of adults standing at the front of a thursday event where the mayor was almost an hour late to sign his first bill into law , the boy then refused to clap as the bill was signed			1
@entity21 is not the first child to have issue with hizzonor ’s lack of regard for others ’ time , a child infamously passed out waiting for the chronically - late mayor to introduce his new city schools chancellor earlier late last year			1
he 's had enough : @entity21 , 4 , sat down after after mayor @entity3 ( talking at the podium in the background ) arrived 45 minutes late to the bill signing people are informally required to stand at the front of events attended by the mayor , regardless of tardiness			1
the mayor ’s first few months have been marred by lateness so routine that city hall reporters have taken to calling it ‘ @entity3 time ’ on social media			1
@entity46 reporter @entity45 , who has covered city hall for decades , said she ’s ‘ never seen anything like it , ’ in a recent report			0
event attendees have n’t been much kinder , but none took to sitting down while waiting for the recently - elected mayor until @entity21 plunked himself down as @entity3 spoke about a paid sick leave bill			1
soon after mayor de @entity3 finally took his seat , 45 minutes late , @entity21 was seated next to him			1
indifferent : @entity21 seems unimpressed with sitting next to the mayor while he signs his first bill into law the audience ceremoniously clapped as the mayor went through pen after pen , using a different one for each letter of his name , as he signed the bill – all except @entity21			0
the young boy looked unimpressed , bored even , and refused to clap while his mother even tried to spur him on			0
she instead awkwardly raised his arm in the arm as he glanced unhappily in the mayor ’s @entity73 incident earned an instant classic headline from the @entity76			0
‘ sit happens ! kid ca n’t ‘ stand ’ wait for chronically late de @entity3			2
’ an expert told @entity46 that @entity3 ’s traveling ‘ late show , ’ as the @entity76 put it , will negatively affect public perception			2
‘ there ’s no question that if you are late that it affects your reputation and that people lose their ability to trust you , especially in politics , especially when you ’re in public office ’ psychologist dr @entity84 told the station			0
a growing problem : a child passed out late last year while waiting for the tardy mayor - elect to announce his new schools chancellor when asked by @entity98 if he thinks reports about ‘ @entity3 time ’ are unfair , the mayor seemed unamused			1
‘ you know , @entity101 , i think the important this is when you get elected to do a job like this , responsible for 8.4 million people with every conceivable subject matter , my job is to do the best for the people , ’ said @entity3			2
‘ that ’s what matters , ’ he continued			0
‘ the rest is noise			0
‘ @entity3 is always running so late , he probably still has n't moved his clocks back an hour , ’ @entity117 wrote on @entity118			2
another person lampooned reports last month the mayor was speeding stop signs and red lights			0
‘ imagine how late he would have been if he did n’t speed and run stop signs to get there , ’ tweeted @entity125			0
dr @entity84 had some great advice for helping @entity3 show up on - time to events ‘ by investing in a good watch and setting it ahead one hour			1

recently - elected @entity4 mayor @entity3 has made a habit of showing up late for official events
his lateness has caused *uproar* among reporters covering his events
