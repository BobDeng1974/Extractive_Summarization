but actor @entity8 could be forgiven for feeling more than a little short - changed after teenagers from a care home overlooking his mansion broke in and stole his prized malt whisky			1
mr @entity8 , 69 , says his local community of @entity15 in @entity16 has been plagued for years by unruly residents from the home and he has now succeeded getting the company that runs it to plant a 12ft hedge to stop any prying eyes			1
hedging his bets : @entity8 at his home @entity23 in @entity16			1
he has forced a nearby children 's home to build a 12ft hedge after two youngsters pinched a bottle of whisky from his home the @entity31 houses just three troubled teenagers , but police say the residents ’ have clocked up 19 crimes locally in the first six months of the year			1
mr @entity8 was on holiday in @entity37 with wife @entity38 , 63 , when the lads raided his £ 750,000 @entity40 i listed property in february this year			1
@entity43 revealed the home had cost them over £ 200,000 in the last seven years			2
between january and june this year , 19 of the 26 crimes in @entity15 concerned the care home - including nine calls about missing children which cost the force £ 22,500			2
yesterday @entity51 , which runs the home , agreed to erect a large hedge around the property in order to stop youngsters looking into the @entity58 ’ home			2
too close for comfort ? the home of @entity8 , @entity23 , @entity16 , on the right and the @entity31 on the left @entity63 's biggest snob is on the right , with @entity65 as @entity66 , sir @entity67 as @entity68 , @entity69 as @entity70 when the got back together to film a new episode in 2002 in fiction as in life : @entity2 starred in a spin - off series in which he moved to the country with his wife , @entity76 , after being forced to flee from @entity63 mr @entity8 , whose @entity23 mansion is just 60 yards away from the home , told a public meeting last month it was in the ' wrong place ' and called for it to be moved			1
he said : '' to be told by the company , after this latest incident when two of the boys got out and broke into the house on two separate occasions , that the home did not feel their staff had been negligent , i find unbelievable			2
' they had broken in and stolen some malt whisky			2
only @entity95 , written by @entity96 , was one of @entity99 's best - loved tv shows and it brought catchphrases such as ' lovely jubbly ' , ' cushty ' , ' plonker ' and ' this time next year we 'll be millionaires ' into living rooms across the country			0
it was first broadcast in 1981 and aired in seven series until 1991 , with sporadic @entity108 specials in later years			0
one festive episode in 1996 - in which @entity68 and @entity66 became wealthy following the discovery and sale of a valuable watch - attracted 24.3million viewers , the highest @entity99 audience for a sitcom			0
' the strength of feeling is very strong			0
we have been going through this for 10 years			0
' the community have had enough , this was the last straw			0
' i understand the need to look after unfortunate young people			1
it is a very difficult job but this is totally in the wrong place			0
' @entity127 , spokeswoman for @entity51 , said : ' an agreement was made to plant a hedge around the boundary of the fence subject to agreement with the landlord			0
' it has been agreed as an interim arrangement that keys can continue to operate the home until the lease expires in 18 months time when the arrangements will be further reviewed			0
' managers at the home also promised to meet @entity142 every two months to iron out any problems or concerns arising from @entity31			1
a friend of the actor said : ' the children ’s home have agreed to erect a hedge which is part grown so at least the young people inside wo n’t be able to ogle @entity8 and @entity38 but how long does a hedge take to grow to full height ? ' it is understood the suggestion is to let the hedge grow to 12ft in height but it ’s not most satisfactory outcome			1

@entity8 lives 60 yards from @entity31 in @entity16
his *picturesque* grade i listed mansion was broken into by two teenagers
home only houses three young people described as ' *extremely* *vulnerable* '
