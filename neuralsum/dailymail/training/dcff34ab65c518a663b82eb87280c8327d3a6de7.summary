by @entity0 published : 09:02 est , 22 february 2013 updated : 10:30 est , 22 february 2013 despite his playboy persona , prince @entity1 has made no secret of his desire to settle down if he could find the the ' right person ' who was ' willing to take on the job '			1
now it seems he has found ' @entity8 ' in the form of @entity10 , a member of the so called @entity12 - who he has been dating since last year			2
despite being coy when quizzed about his love life while in @entity15 at the end of last year , the @entity1 made no secret of his affection for the 24 year old beauty this week as they were pictured embracing on the slopes during a ski holiday with his uncle @entity23 and family			2
public display of affection : prince @entity1 embraces @entity10 on the ski slopes in @entity28 this week in love : the couple are said to be ' keen to spend as much time together as possible ' family friend : @entity10 , pictured with @entity32 , has long been acquainted with her princess daughters now the pair are set to attend the wedding of @entity10 's half - sister , @entity36 , who is marrying sir @entity38 's businessman son @entity37 in @entity39 next week			1
a source told today 's @entity41 that the @entity1 is keen to accompany @entity10 to the wedding because : ' @entity1 and @entity43 are at the exciting stage of a relationship where they just want to spend as much time together as possible			1
' date night : the blue blood blonde was first linked to the prince last may when they were seen leaving a night club together girlfriend in waiting : prince @entity1 has been coy about their relationship until now wedding bells : the couple are due to attend the wedding of @entity57 to @entity59 's half sister @entity58 - @entity60 as any woman in a fledgling relationship will know , a beau agreeing to attend a family wedding with you is a promising sign of commitment			1
so while @entity1 , 28 , may be a long way from popping the question himself , his recent behaviour suggests he 's now prepared for @entity10 to go from being his casual date to filling the role of royal girlfriend			2
indeed , before his trip to @entity15 , friends of privately - educated @entity10 had joked that she was his ' girlfriend - in - waiting '			1
given the intense press interest in royal love lives and the impact @entity1 has seen it have on the life of his late mother @entity81 , and more recently the @entity82 , it 's no surprise he has wanted to shield @entity10 from the public gaze for as long as possible			2
blue - blood : @entity10 with her mother @entity85 at the @entity87 held at the @entity88 in july 2003 the fact his long - term relationship with @entity92 broke down because she was n't prepared for a life in the global spotlight could have also played on his mind			1
but according to the @entity97 's royal correspondent , @entity96 , @entity1 's public display of affection with @entity10 this week was ' a clear message of intent ' from the media savvy prince			1
that message being , ' she 's my girl , and i do n't care who knows			1
' while being the subject of global media attention is new to @entity10 , mingling with the rich , famous and royal , is not			0
she is friends with both @entity113 and @entity114 , joining the former in the world record attempt to complete the @entity117 in a human caterpillar in 2010 , while the latter is said to have introduced her to @entity1			0
royal circles : @entity10 ( second from right ) went to @entity122 in 2010 with friends @entity113 and princess @entity114 record breaker : @entity59 , bottom right , joined princess @entity113 in a human caterpillar to complete the @entity117 in 2010 she is the daughter of renowned @entity126 it girl @entity127 ( whose father was the 6th @entity129 ) and @entity130 ( her mother 's third husband ) owns a fabric company called @entity135 & @entity136			2
her parents have racked up six marriages between them so @entity10 has a number of half brothers and sisters including soon - to - be a @entity142 , @entity36 , who was once admired by @entity144 , and @entity145 , a model for @entity147			1
following her parent 's separation , @entity10 continued to enjoy a privileged upbringing as her bohemian mother then married multi-millionaire @entity152			0
@entity10 attended £ 30,000 - a - year @entity153 in @entity154 where she showed a flair for acting as well as sport			0
she was said to be one of the most popular girls at the sixth form because of her zest for fun and free spirit			0
fun : the dance student , left and far right , loves music festivals and socialising with friends ‘ it was non-stop laughter and mischief for two years , ’ her school friend told the @entity169 last year			0
‘ our group of girls were all quite different and arty , which is more @entity176			0
’ she then attended @entity178 where she studied for a degree in dance and had another boyfriend with royal connections - @entity183 – whose stepfather , @entity185 , is a cousin of the @entity186			0
dancing is the blonde 's passion and she now studies contemporary dance at the @entity191 in @entity192			2
in the spotlight : the world 's media will now be watching @entity10 she is said to dislike the @entity198 party scene usually popular with the upper classes and instead prefers letting her hair down at music festivals			1
her friends say , ' when not in the studio she 's out on the tennis court or up a mountain with her skis			0
' she 's also a fan of travelling , having spent time after university working in @entity209 , which would suit prince @entity1 when he undertakes royal tours			1
he lamented travelling solo last year to @entity213 for the @entity214 saying : ' i 've always said that it ’d probably be easier as a couple			0
i do n’t have anyone			0
i was n’t allowed to bring anybody with me			0
perhaps that wo n't be the case for much longer now things are getting more serious with @entity10			0
pedigree : @entity10 , left , with mother , sister @entity36 and @entity36 's father former flame : prince @entity1 split with @entity92 because life with a royal was n't for her model in the family : @entity59 's half sister @entity145 has starred in a campaign for @entity147			1

prince @entity1 is expected to join @entity10 at her half sister @entity36 's wedding to @entity38 's son
their pda on the ski slopes was his way of telling the world ' she 's my girl , and i do n't care who knows '
as a privately - educated ' blue blood blonde ' she 's deemed a perfect match for the prince
