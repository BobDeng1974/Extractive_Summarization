a plus size campaigner has slammed main street retailer @entity1 after the brand tried to claim that ' unique fabrics and design elements ' were to blame for its female customers being charged more money for larger sizes , while the menswear designs remain the same price regardless of size			1
according to @entity18 - based merchandiser @entity16 , who is calling for the brand to scrap its ' discriminatory ' plus - size up - charges , the discrepancy between the prices for larger men and women is nothing other than ' straight up fat shaming '			1
' @entity11 women like myself are kind of fed up with being treated like second - class citizens by retailers , ' the 34 - year - old told @entity28			0
' i think it 's reached critical mass and people are ready for a change			0
' the smaller the size , the smaller the price : @entity1 's popular @entity35 are $ 34.94 if bought in sizes 0 to 20 unfair increase : any women who buy a pair of the @entity35 in a plus size fit will be charged an additional $ 10 , bringing the total price up to $ 44.94 after ms @entity16 started a petition on @entity45 , calling for the brand to change their gender - biased price policies , a spokeswoman for @entity43 , @entity1 's parent company , released a statement blaming the increased costs for plus - size womenswear on the fact that the larger designs require additional details not found in the smaller sizes ' for women , styles are not just larger sizes of other women ’s items , they are created by a team of designers who are experts in creating the most flattering and on - trend plus styles , which includes curve - enhancing and curve - flattering elements such as four - way stretch materials and contoured waistbands , which most men 's garments do not include , ' spokeswoman @entity63 explained			1
' this higher price point reflects the selection of unique fabrics and design elements			1
' but ms @entity16 insists that the statement does not address why there is not a single increase for any of the larger menswear designs , particularly as they also require the use of additional materials			1
' every woman knows how hard it is to find a good pair of jeans : a pair that is the right fit at the right price , ' she wrote on the petition			0
' that ’s why i was shocked when , during a recent visit to @entity1 ’s website , i noticed that they were charging $ 12 - $ 15 more for plus - sized women 's jeans - but not up - charging jeans for “ big ” men			0
' if they are charging plus - sized women more to cover the cost of the fabric being used , then why are n’t they doing the same for men ? @entity103 up : @entity16 ( pictured ) wants @entity1 to scrap its ' discriminatory ' prices fighting for change : ms @entity16 's petition has been signed by more than 33,000 people ' i was fine paying the extra money as a plus - sized woman , because , you know , more fabric equals higher cost of manufacture			1
however , selling jeans to larger - sized men at the same cost as they sell to smaller men not only negates the cost of manufacture argument , but indicates that @entity1 is participating in both sexism and sizeism , directed only at women			0
' and it seems that ms @entity16 is not alone in her opinion ; thus far her petition has gained the support of more than 33,000 people , with many agreeing that @entity1 's ' unfair ' prices should be scrapped once and for all			1
' i wear a plus size , and have noticed that other stores these sizes may be a bit higher in price , but not to the extent that old navy charges , ' supporter @entity136 commented on the petition			2
plus size discrimination : @entity1 offers a variety of plus size designs but ' and in other stores , men are also charged higher for plus sizes			2
why does old navy penalizes us because we are women ? this discrimination needs to stop			0
' while many brands charge more for their plus size collections , blaming the additional fabric for the increased costs , the majority implement the same - or similar - price adjustments for both men and women			2
' when you ’re talking about needing more yardage , it ’s going to be more expensive - but that ’s true for men as well , ' @entity161 , chief executive of @entity162 , a monthly subscription service for plus - size clothing told @entity28			0
' it does n’t actually make sense to me why men ’s is not priced differently			0

plus size campaigner @entity16 has slammed the brand 's ' discriminatory ' prices which see only women charged more for larger clothing
the retailer claims that plus size womenswear requires ' unique fabrics and design elements ' which are *n't* needed for larger menswear designs
ms @entity16 , 34 , has started a petition to try and *convince* the brand to scrap the unfair price increases
