by @entity0 , royal correspondent published : 10:00 est , 19 june 2013 updated : 14:17 est , 19 june 2013 at the ready : prince @entity1 may have to arrive by helicopter for the birth of his first child in @entity5 father - to - be prince @entity1 may have to rush to hospital via helicopter for the arrival of his first child			1
@entity1 , 30 , will still be working as a @entity12 pilot at @entity13 on @entity14 , when his wife the @entity15 is due to give birth in @entity17			1
but sources have told @entity19 that she is particularly keen to have her family around her in the hospital			2
significantly , our sources strongly hinted that @entity15 's family – particularly her mother , @entity26 , and sister , @entity27 - are likely to be present at the hospital during her labour			1
remarkably , this means that the @entity24 may learn the sex of the new - born future king or queen before even the present @entity34 herself			0
@entity1 is also said to be determined to make it , following in the footsteps of his own father who broke royal tradition to be with his wife , @entity40 , @entity40 , for the birth of both their children			1
previous heirs have been born at home or @entity46			0
as a result , plans are currently being formulated by palace aides to whisk him down to @entity5 by helicopter so he can be present at his son or daughter ’s birth			1
but as any new parent knows , babies have an uncanny knack of making an appearance at the most inconvenient times and the journey is likely to take several hours even with the help of a private aircraft			0
‘ he very much plans to be at the birth but between now and then will also be on and off duty in @entity66 , meaning he might have to get there rather swiftly , ’ said a source			0
‘ it could be by train or car if he is up in @entity14 but should a helicopter be available then that is also a strong possibility			2
’ how will he make it on time ? palace aides are putting plans in place to make sure prince @entity1 gets to hospital for the birth of his first child anxious wait : expectant father prince @entity1 will continue his shifts as a @entity12 pilot in @entity14 as he awaits news of his first child close : sources have strongly hinted that @entity15 's family , especially mother @entity86 and sister @entity27 , will be present at the hospital support : @entity15 is keen to have her mother @entity86 , left , and sister @entity27 , right , around her because her husband @entity1 may be on duty when the baby arrives helicopters aside , the future king is not expecting any special treatment and is due to take just two weeks ’ statutory paternity leave – for which he will be paid £ 136.78 a week – before returning to his normal shift pattern			1
his wife , however , will definitely not return with him to their home on @entity14 with the new baby			2
a palace spokesman said today that there was ‘ still some discussion ’ about where @entity15 and their new - born will be based as a result			0
but the @entity111 has already revealed that she plans to move in with her parents at their £ 4.8 million @entity114 mansion for around six weeks after @entity1 returns to work as builders are still finishing their new apartment at @entity117			0
details of the royal birth plans indicate that although they are a very modern royal couple in many ways , @entity1 and @entity15 are largely sticking to tradition when it comes to their first child			1
traditional : @entity15 and @entity1 , pictured during the @entity125 last weekend - her final public appearance before the birth - are making plans for the arrival of their first child blossoming : @entity131 of @entity132 has dazzled during her pregnancy , right , in april , and left , during her last public appearance before giving birthday at the @entity34 's birthday celebrations royal princess ? @entity131 of @entity132 names the royal princess ship at @entity140 last week by smashing a bottle of champagne on its hull having a giggle : as the champagne smashed on the ship @entity15 laughed and jumped a little , and despite her loose coat she could n't hide how pregnant she was modern fathers : @entity1 , left , is likely to follow his father @entity149 , right , who broke royal tradition to be with princess @entity40 for the birth of their children like the @entity40 before her , @entity15 has chosen the @entity154 at @entity155 ’s where a natural birth , staying in a private suite , is likely to cost up to £ 10,000			1
@entity1 became the first future monarch in history to be born in a hospital when he was delivered there on 21st june 1982 , followed by his brother , @entity161			2
the @entity163 ’s official surgeon - gynaecologist , @entity162 , the former fiancé of murdered television presenter @entity164 , is by happy co-incidence a consultant gynaecologist at @entity155 ’s and will be assisting with the labour			0
he will be led by the @entity34 ’s own surgeon - gynaecologist , @entity167			0
it is understood that contingency plans have been put in place with other hospitals , such as the @entity114 in @entity172 , in case the @entity15 goes into labour when visiting her parents			0
experts : the @entity34 ’s own surgeon - gynaecologist , @entity167 , left , will lead the treatment of the @entity178 supported by the @entity163 ’s official surgeon - gynaecologist , @entity162 , right nightmare journey : father - to - be prince @entity1 may have to travel from @entity14 to @entity155 's hospital in @entity183 , west @entity5 ( pictured ) , to see @entity15 give birth princess @entity40 gave birth to her eldest son in the hospital 's @entity187 , and @entity15 will do the same 31 years later history : the new heir will arrive in the same hospital where prince @entity1 was born to @entity149 and princess @entity40 in 1982 but a source told the @entity111 : ' as was demonstrated when the @entity15 fell ill with a pregnancy - related sickness last year while staying with her parents in @entity114 , she can she be whisked in a private car to central @entity5 within an hour			1
' so it is very unlikely she will give birth anywhere else than @entity155 ’s , quite frankly			2
' while palace aides are keen to retain @entity15 ’s ' dignity ' as a woman in labour , they acknowledge the fact that social media such as @entity208 will make it almost impossible to keep her admittance to hospital a secret unless she is smuggled in			2
but although both @entity46 and @entity214 have their own @entity208 accounts on which details of royal events are frequently now broken , it will most definitely not be the preferred medium to announce the new royal baby			0
instead a formal notice on a piece of creamy @entity224 size @entity46 - headed paper , signed by the medical staff who have assisted the @entity15 , will be brought out of the @entity154 ’s front entrance by a press officer			0
it will then be handed to a waiting driver and driven through the streets of @entity5 – escorted by police outriders - to the @entity232 at the front of @entity46			0
there it will then be placed on an easel , last used to announce prince @entity1 ’s birth , by the main gates in the palace forecourt			1
this will signify to an eager public that a new royal baby has been born			0
same again : on june 22 1982 a sign on an easel was placed at the gates of @entity46 announcing the birth , the previous day , of prince @entity1			1
the same will happen this year with his child @entity249 : @entity1 , pictured with the @entity34 on monday at the annual @entity250 at @entity251 , will be with his wife for the birth , even if he is flown in by helicopter from his @entity257 @entity256 station happy day : @entity15 's pregnancy came around 18 months after their wedding at @entity261 on april 29 2011			1

prince @entity1 will continue shifts at @entity13 in @entity14 before the birth of his first child with the @entity15
he may have to be flown to @entity155 's hospital in @entity5 via helicopter
sources strongly hint @entity86 and @entity27 will be present at hospital as well
