by @entity0 published : 06:24 est , 25 december 2012 updated : 07:24 est , 25 december 2012 a quick and easy eye test could offer an effective way of measuring how fast multiple sclerosis is progressing in someone with the disease			1
researchers performed scans on 164 @entity9 patients that measured the thickness of the lining at the back of the eye			1
the team from @entity15 found patients with thinning of the retina had both earlier and more active forms of the disease			1
breakthrough scan ? @entity21 takes just a few minutes per eye the scan , known as @entity21 ( @entity21 ) , takes just a few minutes per eye and can be performed at a @entity26 surgery			2
multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects nerves in the brain and spinal cord , causing problems with muscle movement , balance and vision			0
around 8 out of 10 people with @entity9 have a type known as relapsing remitting , which means people will have periods where symptoms are mild or disappear followed by flare - ups			0
after around 10 years half of patients will develop secondary progressive disease where symptoms get worse and there is little remission			0
it is difficult for doctors to monitor @entity9 because its course can be unpredictable			1
scientists believe @entity21 could provide a good way to do this			0
' as more therapies are developed to slow the progression of @entity9 , testing retinal thinning in the eyes may be helpful in evaluating how effective those therapies are , ' said study author dr @entity61			1
@entity62 shows multiple sclerosis in the brain : disease causes inflammation the team measured the eyes of 164 @entity9 patients , 59 of whom were showing no symptoms , every six months for around 21 months			2
they also gave them @entity62 brain scans once a year			0
the study found that people with @entity9 relapses had 42 per cent faster thinning than people with @entity9 who had no relapses			2
the mri scans revealed people with @entity9 who had signs of active inflammation - known as gadolinium - enhancing lesions - experienced 54 per cent faster thinning			1
meanwhile people whose level of disability worsened during the study experienced 37 per cent more thinning than those who had no changes in their level of disability			0
the study was supported by the @entity92 , the @entity93 and @entity94 and @entity95 .			0

scan measures thickness of lining at the back of the eye
those with thinning retinas had earlier and more active forms of @entity9
could help doctors to track the unpredictable disease and act to slow its progression
