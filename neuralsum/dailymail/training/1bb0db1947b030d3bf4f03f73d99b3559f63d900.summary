president @entity0 has been criticized for making poor speeches , but according to a new survey , @entity3 's address to the @entity5 people is only slightly more sophisticated			1
@entity7 calculated data on 600 presidential speeches from @entity10 on using a reading comprehension algorithm called the @entity13 readability test			1
the algorithm measures each speech 's word count , sentence length , and word syllables and then assigns a numerical grade parallel with educational level			1
@entity21 : @entity3 's speeches measure only slightly more sophisticated than former president @entity0 who was criticized for making poor public addresses to the nation data : @entity0 ( red ) and @entity3 ( blue were graded similarly numerically in trms of speech sophistication @entity31 reports that a number grade four indicates that the speech could be understood by a fourth - grader			1
a number 12 means the speech would be understood by a college graduate and a grade of 21 or higher is comprehensible by people who have achieved a phd			1
after calculating the data @entity31 reached five conclusions which a former speech writer for @entity44 by the name of @entity46 analysed			2
speeches made by @entity3 and @entity0 were numerically graded somewhere between 7 and 11 and both of their speeches ranked similarly			1
' i do n't see a huge discrepancy here			0
i think president @entity3 , no more or less than president @entity0 , tries to pack a lot of nuance and subtext into language that is as plain and straightforward as possible			1
while president @entity0 was often inarticulate off the cuff , @entity0 's speeches were underestimated			1
there was a crisp formality to a lot of his best speeches , particularly the ones he delivered shortly after sept. 11 , ' said @entity46 after looking at the numbers			1
@entity65 winded : over time speeches have gotten longer and longer and presidents like @entity44 have been criticized for making lengthy @entity68 addresses longer : over the years , presidential speeches have gotten longer and longer from the 1700s until now the study also finds that speeches have become less sophisticated over time because at first presidents were merely speaking to men similar to themselves in education and in status sin life			1
' it 's tempting to read this as a dumbing down of the bully pulpit , ' @entity46 says			2
' but it ’s actually a sign of democratization			0
in the early @entity85 , presidents could assume that they were speaking to audiences made up mostly of men like themselves : educated , civic - minded landowners			2
these , of course , were the only @entity90 with the right to vote			0
but over time , the franchise expanded and presidential appeals had to reach a broader audience			2
' not only have speeches gotten less sophisticated they have also gotten longer			2
president @entity44 was one modern president who would get criticism for writing lengthy @entity68 addresses			0
most variance : @entity99 made speeches with varying degrees of sophistication but his @entity102 was so well received the @entity104 's spech writer looked to it as a reference			1
' one would assume that our decreasing attention span has led to shorter and shorter speeches			0
i believe that no one , not even a president , ought to give a speech that 's longer than 20 minutes			2
president @entity44 used to get tremendous grief from commentators about the length of his @entity68 addresses			0
but our polling showed that the public liked the long speeches — and people actually stayed tuned			0
but very few speakers are as compelling as @entity44 , ' said former speechwriter @entity46			0
the study finds that when presidents like @entity125 and @entity10 made speeches to @entity90 that they simplified their language			1
though , @entity46 says that this type of variation is rarely seen today			0
' if @entity10 and @entity125 simplified their language when speaking to @entity90 , they must have seen some kind of gap , either in language or in shared cultural understanding ( or both ) , between themselves and their audience			2
presidents today certainly modify their language when speaking to different groups — when speaking in @entity139 , @entity140 , president @entity44 would often roll out @entity142 expressions that you 'd never hear him use in a speech at the @entity145			0
but when a live microphone or camera is in front of them , presidents are really speaking to everyone at once			0
so i do n't imagine you 'd see this degree of variation today , ' says @entity46			0
the data shows that @entity99 's speeches ranged in numerical grade from seven to 21			1
@entity99 ’s gettysburg address was so inspirational that that both @entity104 and his speechwriter would refer to it for inspiration			0
according to the speechwriter , one syllable words as oppose to three syllable words make the speech more effective .			0
