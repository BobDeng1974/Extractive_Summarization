a top - secret weapon being developed by the @entity3 military was destroyed four seconds after its launch from a test range in @entity6 early on monday after controllers detected a problem with the system , the @entity0 said			1
the @entity10 is part of a program to create a missile that will destroy targets anywhere on @entity15 within hours - traveling at speeds in excess of 3,500 miles - an - hour or @entity18			1
the mission was aborted to ensure public safety , and no one was injured in the incident , which occurred shortly after 4 am edt at the @entity23 in @entity6 , said @entity24 , a spokeswoman for the @entity0			1
' we had to terminate , ' @entity24 said			2
' the weapon exploded during takeoff and fell back down in the range complex , ' she added			1
the incident caused an undetermined amount of damage to the launch facility 25 miles from the city of @entity34 , @entity24 said			1
the rocket carrying the @entity10 was terminated near a pad of the @entity23 on @entity48 shortly after liftoff , spokeswoman @entity24 said			1
after an anomaly was detected , testers made the decision to destroy the rocket to ensure public safety , @entity24 said			2
" it came back down on the range complex , " she said			0
" fortunately , no people on the ground were injured			0
there was damage , but i 'm not sure of the extent of it at this time			0
" the launch complex is about 25 miles from the city of @entity34			1
witnesses watched the rocket lift off at 12:25 am , quickly head nose - down and explode , @entity66 radio reported			1
according to the @entity70 , the @entity10 is being developed as a joint project between the @entity72 and the @entity73 to form the @entity0 's @entity10 initiative			1
the @entity0 wants a weapon that can strike targets anywhere in the world within hours using a conventionally armed missile traveling at @entity18 or 3,500 miles an hour			1
the missile would be used to hit terrorist targets identified on satellites thousands of miles away or weapons of mass destruction being moved in open ground that only have a small window within which to strike			2
the disastrous abort of the @entity10 in @entity87 follows a failed test by the @entity90 military of a similar system			0
the @entity93 missile is being developed by @entity90 to launch nuclear warheads or to strike ships and is being designed to travel at speeds of up to @entity97 or 8,000 miles - an - hour			1
@entity99 â€™s @entity98 , said that the @entity90 test of the @entity101 - 14 three weeks ago failed in similar circumstances to the @entity3 test			0
according to the @entity70 , @entity104 too is attempting to develop its own hypersonic weapon			2
source : @entity70 @entity34 photographer @entity39 watched the launch from @entity41 in @entity42 , about a dozen miles from the launch site			1
he described the explosion as quite loud and scary			0
a fire afterward burned brightly			0
the rocket was the booster for the @entity10 , a glide vehicle designed to quickly reach a target			2
the design is one of several being tested by the @entity73 under the umbrella of the @entity119 program , @entity24 said			1
" it 's a concept that will allow the @entity0 to engage any target anywhere in the world in less than an hour , " she said			0
the first flight test of the @entity10 on november 17 , 2011 , flew the weapon from @entity125 to @entity126 in the @entity127			2
the test monday was designed to enhance previous ground testing , modeling and simulation , @entity24 said			2
traveling at hypersonic speed , the glider also was aimed at @entity126 and was supposed to cover the 3,500 miles in less than an hour , @entity24 said			0
experimental : traveling at hypersonic speed , the glider also was aimed at @entity126 and was supposed to cover the 3,500 miles in less than an hour experimental : this @entity3 @entity140 artists rendering shows the @entity141 ( @entity142 - 2 )			2
the @entity3 military had to detonate a hypersonic weapon seconds after lift - off on august 25 , 2014 due to a technical problem , cutting short a flight test for the experimental project , officials said on monday strike capability : the @entity141 will be launched on a rocket into space then will glide back down to @entity15			1
the 2011 test flight lasted only nine minutes before being deliberately crashed as a safety measure due to technical difficulties it was a setback for the @entity3 program , which some analysts see as countering the growing development of ballistic missiles by @entity161 and @entity162 but others say is part of an arms race with @entity90 , which tested a hypersonic system in january			0
@entity167 , founder of the nonprofit @entity168 , said he did not think monday 's failure would lead to the program 's termination			2
' this is such an important mission and there is promise in this technology , ' he said			0
he said officials aborted the mission after detecting a fault in the computers			0
@entity180 , a defense analyst at the @entity181 think tank , said the technology was best suited for use against smaller , less - developed countries with missiles			0
' the @entity3 has never assumed that these ... are going to be systems that you can use against a power like @entity90 by themselves , ' he said			0
' for a country like @entity161 or @entity162 , they could be a very significant deterrent			0
' the rocket carrying the @entity10 was terminated near a pad of the @entity23 ( pictured ) on @entity48 shortly after liftoff @entity198 , a defense analyst at the @entity199 , said the @entity0 had never been clear about the mission for the weapon , with some viewing it as an effective tool against terrorists and others seeing it as a counter to @entity90 or @entity161 and @entity162			1
while hypersonic weapons are unlikely to be fielded for a decade , @entity198 said the fact that @entity209 and @entity210 were both testing the weapons indicated there was a real potential for an arms race			0
' i believe the @entity3 program is significantly more sophisticated than the @entity90 program , ' he said			0
the weapon , known as the @entity10 , was developed by @entity219 and the @entity73			1
@entity24 said it included a glide body mounted on a three - stage , solid - propellant booster system known as stars , for @entity224			0
in a previous test in november 2011 , the craft had successfully flown from @entity125 to the @entity126 in the @entity227 , she said			0
on monday , it was supposed to fly from @entity6 to the @entity126			1
@entity198 said no conclusions could be drawn about the weapon based on monday 's accident because the launcher detonated before the glide vehicle could be deployed .			1

rocket carrying an experimental @entity73 strike weapon exploded early monday after taking off from a launch pad in @entity6
