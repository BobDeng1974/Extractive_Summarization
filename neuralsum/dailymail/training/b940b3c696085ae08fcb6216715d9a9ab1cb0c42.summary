@entity0 believes @entity1 will make a decent replacement as @entity4 captain when @entity5 brings the curtain down on his time at @entity8 , but feels he lacks the quality of the current leader			1
writing on his @entity12 account , @entity0 describes @entity1 as the only real candidate to take over the armband from the man who has been synonymous with @entity4 across the last 17 years			1
' i think @entity1 will captain @entity4 , judging on what ( @entity18 ) @entity17 has been saying about him , ' @entity0 explained			1
' however , i am reluctant to compare @entity1 to @entity5 , as i do n't believe he is blessed with the talent of @entity21 and i 'm not sure he will be able to develop it			1

he plays every game and when you look around the pitch for candidates , there are n't too many obvious choices			0

@entity5 missed @entity4 's 2 - 0 win at @entity46 on saturday through a groin injury , but could return for the @entity23 semi-final clash with @entity49 at @entity8 on tuesday			2
' @entity5 's final game at @entity8 will have a similar atmosphere to sir @entity52 's at @entity53 , ' @entity0 said			2
' hopefully , he will stay fit , healthy and involved for it			0
' it will be an unbelievable atmosphere and the fans will give @entity5 the perfect send off			0
