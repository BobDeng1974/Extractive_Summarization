the first thing you need to know about @entity2 is just how much he loves winning football matches			1
it is everything to him — whether it is the @entity7 , the @entity8 or a charity match			1
last summer , @entity2 was in charge of the @entity12 , i was playing for @entity15 ’s @entity14 side and @entity2 ’s team were leading at @entity17 going into the final moments			1
to ensure the advantage was preserved , however , @entity2 — with a glint in his eye — had a word with @entity23 , the @entity24 actor , who he was putting on as substitute			1
not long after , @entity23 had gone to ground with an ‘ injury ’ to help run the clock down			2
the job was done and they won 4 - 2 ! @entity31 ( left ) @entity32 and @entity33 joke during training at the end of a hard week for @entity36 @entity2 spikily replied to comments made by @entity38 and @entity39 @entity40 controls the ball as the @entity7 leaders look forward to sunday 's @entity44 game i must stress that it was all good - natured , but on wednesday night against @entity49 , the actions of a @entity2 team were significantly darker			1
i called @entity36 ’s behaviour disgraceful and sad as they pursued a @entity8 quarter - final place			1
they went beyond what is acceptable but , unfortunately , it is not the first time we have seen them do it			1
i doubt it will be the last , either			2
@entity2 and his teams take winning to a level that other teams and managers do not			1
@entity2 shakes hands with fans before the start of last summer 's @entity67 match at @entity17 @entity38 ( centre ) played for @entity15 's @entity14 side for the charity game in june last year as the seconds dwindled , @entity71 ( left ) went down with an injury as the the @entity12 won 4 - 2 respect for @entity2 ’s achievements in the game is beyond doubt			1
in a few years from now , we could be acknowledging him as the most successful manager of all time , particularly if he keeps picking up a trophy every 35 matches , as is his current remarkable ratio			1
but will he be loved ? @entity36 fans undoubtedly adore him			1
@entity86 and @entity87 supporters will too			1
yet beyond that ? it is debatable			2
will he care how he is remembered ? i think he will			2
deep down , i think everyone in football cares how they are perceived			0
@entity36 players surround @entity96 as the @entity98 referee gives @entity99 his marching orders it was this tackle by the @entity104 on @entity105 that had the @entity36 players swarming round the ref @entity99 's night was over after the tackle in the first half every outfield @entity36 player except @entity105 was involved in the mass protest are trophies more important than creating good memories ? i would always argue ‘ yes ’ to that			1
during my career , i won 10 major honours but none of the @entity118 teams i played for is particularly remembered for being a top side			0
if i ’m honest , it annoys me , especially when i hear stories even now of how great @entity124 ’s @entity123 team of 1995 - 96 were or how thrilling the @entity126 team were that reached the @entity8 semi-final in 2000			1
yes , they both played fast , exciting football but what did they win ? nothing			0
@entity2 led @entity86 to the @entity133 in 2003 and the @entity8 a year after @entity2 grabs @entity134 after guiding @entity87 to their third @entity8 in 2010 you want to be successful and have a reputation that spans a lifetime , like the @entity139 team of the 1950s that @entity141 and @entity142 inspired to five consecutive @entity144 cups or the @entity146 team of @entity147 and @entity148 from the 1970s			1
they took that style on to the @entity98 national squad			0
@entity148 once said , ‘ how you play is more important than what you win ’ and to some extent , he is right			0
the @entity156 side from the 1974 @entity157 , for instance , get spoken about more than the @entity159 squad that actually won it			0
personally , i would have rather been a @entity159 than in the @entity98 squad that came up short			0
the same goes for @entity165 in 1982 , the other great team that captured hearts but failed to conquer the world			0
@entity139 's @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity169 pose before a game in 1959 @entity148 rounds @entity172 keeper @entity171 before scoring in the 1974 @entity157 quarter - final the great @entity175 side of 1982 celebrate @entity177 ' wonderful equaliser in the 3 - 2 defeat by winners @entity180 i know most of the names of that great squad , as i am sure many do — @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity177 — but what would those men rather have , a winner ’s medal — like their compatriots in 1970 — or just the knowledge that everyone loved the football they played ? in an ideal world , you get remembered for winning with style			1
the best example i have of that from my childhood was the @entity201 team of @entity202 , @entity203 and @entity204 that was guided by @entity205 in the late 1980s			0
their quality in that period was beyond compare and they remain the last side to retain the @entity8			1
@entity211 ’s @entity210 , however , are the team that took style and success to another level all together			0
they will still be writing books about them in 50 years , such was the swagger with which they won 14 trophies in four extraordinary years			2
when a team wins silverware with imagination and fantasy , it almost seems more special			0
@entity2 is just as prolific at collecting trophies as @entity211 but the brand of football his team play does not compare			1
that is why , in the long - term , you wo n’t find his teams spoken about like some of the others i have mentioned			2
the behaviour of the teams , of course , does n’t help either			0
@entity36 have been likened to the @entity126 team from the 1970s but i actually think the way they conducted themselves was worse during @entity2 ’s first spell in @entity14			1
they were prepared to push it further still			0
@entity211 is thrown by his adoring @entity210 players after winning the 2011 @entity8 @entity126 players surround @entity247 after the referee controversially allowed @entity250 's goal in 1971 @entity32 , @entity251 , @entity252 and @entity253 get in referee @entity255 ' face in 2007 none of that might bother @entity2 , in the same way it did n’t bother @entity259			1
i remember him once telling me about a conversation he had with a @entity263 journalist , about what was perceived as ‘ great football ’ and ‘ winning football ’			2
@entity259 was puzzled by this , so he asked the journalist : ‘ who scored @entity270 ’s winning goal in the 1964 @entity271 ? ’ the reply came : ‘ @entity273 ’			2
so @entity259 then asked , ‘ and how did @entity270 play in the game ? ’ to which there was silence			0
@entity105 appeared to be no worse off after @entity99 's midweek tackle as he trained on friday @entity279 sat down for a bit of keepy - uppy at @entity282 as the players prepared for @entity44 @entity2 keeps a close eye on things as the @entity287 boss gets his side ready for sunday 's lunchtime kick - off his point was all that mattered was @entity270 had won the trophy			1
@entity2 would clearly understand the logic in that argument			1
i can see what he means , too			0
but the idea of winning at all costs ? that is something with which i am not comfortable			2
i loved winning , there was nothing better that you could experience in football			1
but when all is said and done , you want to be remembered and respected for what you achieved			0
and if @entity2 ’s teams keep taking things to the brink , the love his achievements should secure is unlikely to ever come			1
@entity314 revival will put big clubs on alert there is a big game in the @entity319 with @entity320 coming up against @entity321			0
praise for the work of @entity320 ’s @entity324 , the former @entity321 boss , shows no sign of dwindling , particularly after he was named manager of the month for february			2
@entity320 are thriving under his guidance and there is little doubt they will be in the @entity7 next season			1
but what about @entity314 , the man who succeeded @entity324 at @entity321 ? @entity324 won the manager of the month award for february after his fine work at @entity320 @entity314 ( right ) has flown under the radar but has led the @entity337 to eighth in the @entity7 without grabbing any headlines , @entity314 has impressively manoeuvred @entity321 into eighth place in the @entity7 and they have built on their efforts of last season			1
they spent just £ 1.2million last summer , and lost @entity342 to a serious knee injury , but they continue to get good results			0
only @entity118 and @entity345 have picked up more points since @entity347			0
the work @entity314 has done at the @entity349 seems to have gone under the radar			0
his journey since he was sacked in a poor manner by @entity353 in december 2009 has n’t always been smooth			0
for instance , he was criticised for the way he left @entity356 in 2011 and was then sacked by @entity357 after spending less than a year at @entity358 , even though he kept them in the top flight in may 2012			0
but he has rebuilt his reputation in the @entity362 and looks like he will be rewarded with a new contract			0
if he continues to make such impressive strides , he may get the chance once again to work at a club that can regularly compete for top honours			0
this week i 'm looking forward to ... seeing if @entity369 can keep flying the flag in @entity371 another disappointing week in @entity371 for teams from the @entity7 but , once again , @entity369 proved an exception to the rule			2
the last hour of their clash with @entity377 saw @entity369 playing at their best under @entity378 — the football was good , the energy was high and there was an intensity in everything they did			0
it all helped to show how difficult @entity386 can be to play against in that mood			0
he bulldozed his way past a number of challenges to set up @entity392 ’s goal , showed character to take the crucial penalty and bullied @entity377 ’s defenders , including the highly - rated @entity396			2
he now has 16 goals for the season			0
@entity386 skips past @entity396 ( left ) during an all - action display against @entity377 @entity386 's penalty was not convincing , but it hands @entity369 the upper hand in the tie ahead of the return leg when you see @entity369 play like that , you wonder why they have struggled in the @entity7			1
but if they replicate the performance that gave them a 2 - 1 lead to take to @entity412 , they will have an outstanding chance of beating @entity123 for just their second league win of 2015			2
as soon as @entity369 start getting points on the board again , the tense atmosphere around @entity416 will relax and @entity419 will be able to enjoy the @entity144 adventure a little bit more .			0

winning is everything to @entity2 - whether it is the @entity7 , the @entity8 or a charity match
@entity36 went beyond what is acceptable against @entity49 but , unfortunately , it is not the first time we have seen them do it . i doubt it will be the last , either
in a few years from now , we could be acknowledging @entity2 as the most successful manager of all time
but will he be loved ? @entity36 fans undoubtedly adore him . @entity86 and @entity87 supporters will too . yet beyond that ? it is debatable
