astronomers may have finally found evidence of the elusive dark matter that permeates the universe			1
its presence has potentially been spotted in a dwarf matter orbiting the @entity7 which is radiating gamma rays - the most powerful form of radioactive waves known in the universe			1
how these mysterious waves are made , and where exactly they come from have baffled scientists for years , but scientists believe they are a sign for dark matter			1
bright areas indicate a strong gamma ray signal coming from the direction of the galaxy , according to the researchers â€™ search algorithm dark matter is the missing substance that makes up to 80 per cent of the universe 's mass. it has been described as ' the most important unsolved problems in modern physics			1
' when physicists study the dynamics of galaxies and the movement of stars , they are confronted with a mystery			0
if they only take visible matter into account , their equations simply do n't add up ; the elements that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of objects and the existing gravitational forces			0
from this they deduced that there must be an invisible kind of matter that does not interact with light but does , as a whole , interact by means of the gravitational force			0
called ' dark matter ' , this substance appears to make up at least 80 per cent of the matter in the known universe			2
the galaxy , named @entity26 2 , was discovered within the past few weeks in the data of the @entity72			0
at 98,000 light - years from @entity73 , @entity26 is one of the nearest dwarf galaxies yet detected according to physicists at @entity22 , @entity21 and @entity23 universities , gamma rays coming from the direction of the galaxy are in excess of what would be expected from normal background			1
' something in the direction of this dwarf galaxy is emitting gamma rays , ' said @entity88 , a postdoctoral research associate at @entity22			1
' there 's no conventional reason this galaxy should be giving off gamma rays , so it 's potentially a signal for dark matter , ' said @entity88 , a postdoctoral research associate in @entity22 's @entity96 and the paper 's lead author			1
' in the search for dark matter , gamma rays from a dwarf galaxy have long been considered a very strong signature , ' added @entity21 's @entity103 , an assistant professor of physics			1
' it seems like we may now be detecting such a thing for the first time			0
' the researchers caution that while these preliminary results are exciting , there 's more work to be done to confirm a dark matter origin			2
scientists know that dark matter exists because it exerts gravitational effects on visible matter , which explains the observed rotation of galaxies and galaxy clusters as well as the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background			2
dwarf galaxies are important in the hunt for the dark matter particle			2
they are thought to lack other gamma - ray - producing sources , so a gamma ray flux from a dwarf galaxy would make a very strong case for dark matter			1
pictured is an artist 's impression of the jet from a gamma - ray burst emerging at nearly light speed ' the gravitational detection of dark matter tells you very little about the particle behaviour of the dark matter , ' said @entity140 , assistant professor of physics and a member of @entity22 's @entity143			1
gamma rays from a dwarf galaxy have long been considered a very strong signature of dark matter			1
a leading theory suggests that dark matter particles are @entity149 , or @entity149			0
when pairs of @entity149 meet , they annihilate one another , giving off high - energy gamma rays			0
if that 's true , then there should be a lot of gamma rays emanating from places where @entity149 are thought to be plentiful , like the dense centres of galaxies			0
' but now we may have a non-gravitational detection that shows dark matter behaving like a particle , which is a holy grail of sorts			0
' a leading theory suggests that dark matter particles are @entity149 , or @entity149			0
when pairs of @entity149 meet , they annihilate one another , giving off high - energy gamma rays			0
if that 's true , then there should be a lot of gamma rays emanating from places where @entity149 are thought to be plentiful , like the dense centres of galaxies			0
the trouble is , the high - energy rays also originate from many other sources , including black holes and pulsars , which makes it difficult to untangle a dark matter signal from the background noise			2
that 's why dwarf galaxies are important in the hunt for the dark matter particle			2
they are thought to lack other gamma - ray - producing sources , so a gamma ray flux from a dwarf galaxy would make a very strong case for dark matter			1
' they 're basically very clean and quiet systems , ' professor @entity103 said			0
scientists have been looking at them for signs of gamma rays for the last several years using @entity198 's @entity197			2
there 's never been a convincing signal , until now			0
further study of this dwarf galaxy 's attributes could reveal hidden sources that may be emitting gamma rays , but the researchers are cautiously optimistic			1
' the fact that there are gamma rays and also a clump of dark matter in the same direction makes it quite interesting , ' professor @entity140 said .			1

dark matter is the missing material making up 80 *%* of universe 's mass
gamma rays from a dwarf galaxy are considered a sign of dark matter
they were spotted in direction of ' @entity26 ' 98,000 light - years away
scientists say this is the most convincing signal of dark matter yet
