@entity5 , 61 , sacked @entity3 , 31 , last @entity13 following a shouting match which ended with the employee calling her boss ' a horrible b * * * * '			2
however , a tribunal described her action as ' unreasonable ' and criticised her for making it based on personal rather than business reasons			0
employment tribunal judge @entity22 also described the atmosphere at the bridal shop as ' volatile ' , and that much of this atmosphere was down to a need to provide added drama for the reality television show			2
miss @entity3 brought the case against ms @entity5 last december , after she was sacked from @entity31 in @entity32 , where she had worked for six years			1
@entity33 star ms @entity5 once praised miss @entity3 for for taking her business ' to another level '			1
however she fired her former pal allegedly following a shouting match which ended with miss @entity3 calling her ms @entity5 a ‘ horrible b * * * * ’			1
judge @entity22 ruled that ms @entity5 , who miss @entity3 described as ' like an aunt ' , had reacted to the insult ' as a friend ' , rather than an employer , and not for a reason relating to her work			1
ms @entity5 , who rose to fame designing opulent dresses for traveller brides has now been ordered to pay miss @entity3 £ 1,200 , and faces having to fork out more money in compensation			1
the judge upheld miss @entity3 ' claims that she was unfairly dismissed by ms @entity5 , that she was owed wages , was provided with no written contract of employment and that her employer failed to follow @entity57 guidelines when conducting the disciplinary procedure			1
in his judgement ruling mr @entity22 said : ' all things and personalities considered , the atmosphere in the place of work was volatile and loud rows would erupt			0
' @entity66 shouted at each other and could be abusive on occasions			0
' this informality and volatility was tolerated by the respondent and to an extent , particularly when filming of the television documentary , was actively appreciated by the respondent so as to avoid the risk of the film footage being perceived to be boring			0
' ruling : @entity6 star @entity5 , left , has been ordered to pay miss @entity79 £ 1,200 in back pay by the employment tribunal			1
the tribunal heard how prior to miss @entity3 losing her £ 400 - a - week job at @entity87 , she and ms @entity83 had been firm friends			1
miss @entity3 had known ms @entity5 since she was just four years old , and her former employer had even bought her a car for her 30th birthday			1
' the respondent was very generous to the claimant and they worked closely together , ' said the judgement			0
' the claimants appeal against dismissal was not dealt with promptly and there was considerable delay in the holding of the appeal hearing			0
' the investigation into the matter was flawed			0
' the claimant was dismissed for personal reasons of the respondent that related to the claimants personal conduct towards her and not for a reason that related to conduct having a bearing on her work			0
unfair : tribunal judge @entity22 upheld miss @entity3 ' claims that she was unfairly dismissed by ms @entity5 , who rose to fame on the @entity33 show ' the respondent reacted to an insult from a friend in personal circumstances , rather than as a reasonable employer			1
' the matter was personal and not business			0
' ms @entity5 was ordered to pay back the £ 1200 that had been deducted from miss @entity3 's wages , and a compensation package will be agreed at a remedy hearing next year			1
during the tribunal miss @entity3 had claimed that there were regular arguments at the business which nobody else was punished for and that there was no discipline structure			2
employment : ms @entity5 paid @entity3 £ 400 a week to design dresses for @entity31 , based in @entity32 her mother @entity136 also gave evidence suggesting ms @entity5 , who rose to fame on the @entity33 series about the traveller community , routinely mistreated her staff			1
ms @entity136 , who is currently suspended from her role as assistant manager at the company , told the court hearing in @entity32 that she was ' treated like a dog ' by her employer , who had also been a close friend for more than 20 years			0
however , @entity149 , an employment expert speaking on behalf of ms @entity5 , said that miss @entity3 was ' spoiled ' and ' over-reacted ' after the publicity from featuring on the tv programme had ' gone to her head '			1
speaking about the result , ms @entity3 said : ' i am over the moon with the outcome			2
it has been a long process , coming up to a year since i was dismissed , and i am really pleased			0
' i knew that there was only ever going to be one verdict			0
' judge @entity22 saw through all of the lies - thank god he did			0
' miss @entity3 has now launched her own fashion business - @entity164 - and has been flooded with orders for christening and communion dresses from the gypsy community			2
she added : ' it is onwards and upwards from here for me			0
' i am concentrating on my business			0
' i have had plenty of orders already and everyone has been so supportive of me			0
' ms @entity5 , who denied the claims made at the tribunal , was unavailable for comment			2
miss @entity3 's solicitor @entity178 said : ' it was one of the most overwhelming decisions i have seen in favour of the claimant			1
' @entity3 is delighted with the outcome and looks forward to continuing her new business			2
' after the success of the @entity6 series , ms @entity5 went on to appear in spin - off @entity190 's @entity189 the court case came just one year after ms @entity5 published her autobiography , @entity193 , in which she praised miss @entity3			1
she wrote : ' @entity3 is now the head designer at @entity87 and is starting to oversee parts of the process that i had to do , which is great , because it means that i can concentrate on other parts of the business			1
' i used to feel that every one of my dresses was like my baby and that no one could do them as well as me but i know now that the future of @entity87 is in @entity3 's hands			2
' since she started working for me , @entity3 has taken @entity87 to another level			2
not only that , she also inherited her mum @entity208 's determination and loyalty			0
