@entity1 scientists have created the world 's first glow - in - the - dark pigs that emit a fluorescent green light			1
the piglets acquired their bizarre ability to glow under ' black ' or @entity8 light after their embryos were injected with dna from a jellyfish			2
experts claim that the 10 young animals should live as long as any other pig and that the findings could help develop cheaper drugs for humans			1
the rabbits , which look identical to their white siblings in daylight , were born at a research center in @entity24			1
just like with the pigs , the fluorescent colouring is an indicator that genetic material injected into the embryos was incorporated into the rabbit 's natural make up and it is hoped the experiment is a first step to producing medicine for genetic diseases			0
the experiment , which used fluorescent protein from jellyfish , furthers the research started in the 1980s when glow in the dark mice were created			1
since then , scientists have recreated the experiment in kittens , puppies , monkeys and piglets			2
while most glow green in the dark , in 2007 @entity58 scientists managed to develop cats that glowed red under ultraviolet light			1
the technique was developed by reproductive scientists at the @entity63 at @entity65 's @entity64			2
the same method was used to create the world 's first glow - in - the - dark rabbits in @entity24 earlier this year , where they are currently working to create a glowing sheep			1
dr @entity71 and dr @entity72 of the @entity73 have detailed the research that produced the pigs in a study that will be published the journal @entity78			2
in a video accompanying the research , the pigs grunt when the lights are turned off and after a short while begin to squeal , perhaps hinting that they are a little scared of the dark			0
the green tint indicates that the fluorescent genetic material injected into the pig embryos has been incorporated into the animal ’s natural make - up			2
under normal artificial light , the piglets look entirely normal ( pictured )			0
the technique was developed by reproductive scientists at the @entity63 and was used to create the world 's first glow - in - the - dark rabbits in @entity24 earlier this year ' it ’s just a marker to show that we can take a gene that was not originally present in the animal and now exists in it , ' explained dr @entity102 , a bioscientist at the @entity63 's @entity103			1
dr @entity102 said the animals are not affected by the fluorescent protein and will have the same life span as other pigs			0
' the green is only a marker to show that it ’s working easily , ' he said			0
researchers in @entity23 and @entity24 successfully created the litter of eight rabbits ( pictured ) , which included two kits that glow green when the lights are out			1
the fluorescent colouring is an indicator that genetic material injected into the embryos was incorporated into the rabbit 's natural make up the ultimate goal of the research is to introduce beneficial genes into larger animals to create less costly and more efficient medicines			0
' [ for ] patients who suffer from haemophilia and need the blood - clotting enzymes in their blood , we can make those enzymes a lot cheaper in animals rather than a factory that will cost millions of dollars to build , ' dr @entity102 explained			0
the @entity103 at the @entity64 focuses on reproductive research			0
its aims to continue to improve human in vitro fertilization techniques .			0

scientists at @entity73 in @entity142 say that the 10 piglets could help them develop cheaper drugs for humans
same technique used to create glow - in - the - dark rabbits in @entity24 earlier this year , where they are now working to produce fluorescent sheep
