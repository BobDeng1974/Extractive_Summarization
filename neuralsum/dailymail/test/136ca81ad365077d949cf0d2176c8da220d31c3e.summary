@entity0 might not be the first hotspot that springs to mind for a summer holiday – but that could change after it was named @entity5 's cheapest destination yesterday			1
the former @entity7 state has gained the most from the strong pound , which has cut the cost of visiting the continent			0
resorts on its @entity13 coast offer the best value in terms of a meal out , buying a cup of coffee and essentials such as sun cream and a cold drink , according to a study			1
research into an imaginary shopping basket of ten typical holiday purchases showed a total price of £ 37.39 for @entity0 , which is down by 13.6 per cent from last summer			1
there was a bigger fall of 22 per cent for the @entity49 in @entity50 , taking the total cost to £ 44.02 , helping it beat @entity33 's @entity53 to become the second cheapest destination			1
only in @entity56 , where inflation is 7.6 per cent – compared to virtually zero in @entity55 and the eurozone – will @entity55 find the cost of a day out much more expensive			1
the figures , compiled for the annual @entity61 , show the spending basket in @entity56 is up by 21.4 per cent on last year , at £ 65.70			2
@entity0 's most popular resort of @entity26 is a carbon copy of those of @entity33 and @entity34			1
described by travel agents as ' lively ' , it has a wide sandy beach , high - rise hotels , bars , restaurants and water parks			2
it also has a long summer season from may to september and boasts around 300 days of sunshine year – more than @entity75 in @entity76			0
peak - season return flights to @entity79 airport cost £ 400 a head			0
once there , a three - course meal for two with wine comes in at £ 19.60 , and a cup of coffee at 78p			0
the country , whose currency is the lev , also has some popular ski resorts			2
the research is good news for travellers to the @entity49 , which offers good - value restaurants , with a three - course meal for two including wine costing just £ 16.42 , while a coffee will set you back 52p			0
at the other end of the scale , @entity99 in southern @entity100 is the dearest resort			2
its basket costs £ 101.60 – almost three times @entity0 's			1
holiday : @entity0 ( pictured ) is one of 13 @entity5 hotspots out of 14 where your cash will go far further this summer , largely thanks to rock - bottom exchange rates and higher inflation in some countries there , a cup of coffee comes in at £ 1.49 , while the three - course meal for two was a much dearer £ 52.24			1
@entity115 , of @entity116 , said : ' meal prices can have a big impact on the holiday budget and make a big dent in holiday finances for people who plan to eat out every night			0
' in the @entity49 , a three - course meal costs less than half the price in other resorts			0
be aware of what to expect before facing the bill			0
