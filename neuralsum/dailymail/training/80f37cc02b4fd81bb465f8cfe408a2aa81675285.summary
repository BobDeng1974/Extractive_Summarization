the third match of @entity1 ’ pre-season tour of @entity3 had a theatrical start on tuesday morning as the @entity5 parachuted in to drop the match ball onto the centre circle			1
from then on in , however , a second string @entity1 side failed to scale any great heights themselves as they narrowly edged past @entity14 part - timers @entity12			1
@entity15 had made 10 changes from the side that beat @entity18 2 - 1 on saturday night in northern @entity19 , with only @entity20 keeping his place in the starting line - up			1
goal : rangers beat @entity12 2 - 1 during their pre-season tour of @entity3 @entity1 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity26 ; @entity27 ( @entity28 46 ) , @entity29 , @entity20 ( @entity30 90 ) , @entity31 ; @entity32 ( @entity33 75 ) , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 ; @entity37 ( @entity38 61 ) , @entity39 ( @entity40 61 ) subs not used : @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 @entity1 goals : @entity32 9 , @entity37 29			1
@entity12 goal : @entity53 11			2
@entity35 was the only other name from the strong team that lost 3 - 1 to @entity56 last week			1
but in @entity59 , the venue that hosted the 1994 @entity61 , the @entity58 fringe players largely failed to prove to their manager they can be worth their weight in gold in the upcoming @entity66 season			0
youngster @entity32 was arguably the pick of the bunch , scoring one , nearly adding another , and setting up a strike for frontman @entity37			1
but after a decent first - half performance , levels dipped against a semi professional outfit that play in the fourth - tier of the @entity77 soccer pyramid , although @entity1 did hold out to record their second win of their visit to @entity19 and @entity14			1
it ’s certainly fair to say there has been more than a touch of the bizarre about this tour			0
none more so than when @entity1 waltzed past @entity18 in a stunning stadium in front of the @entity87 on saturday night			2
in @entity89 , free chicken sandwiches were dished out to fans to ‘ celebrate ’ the first booking for a @entity1 player , while supporters won free pizza when @entity89 scored			0
looking on : @entity1 manager @entity15 ( right ) and @entity95 during their pre-season training on tuesday morning , the surreal quotient was fulfilled in the form of the skydivers landing one - by - one on the pitch , to the booming soundtrack of ‘ it ’s raining men ’ by the @entity104			1
it literally was raining men and when the last skydiver delivered the match ball onto the centre circle , the majority of the 5000 - capacity crowd hooted and hollered their raucous approval			0
there were a few raised eyebrows among the travelling @entity115 , however			0
rangers were then serenaded onto the park by the @entity118 , with the whole hoopla causing the match to be more than 20 minutes late kicking off			0
but the @entity58 side did not waste any time taking the lead when @entity35 – who scored the late winner against @entity89 - rolled the ball across the goalline and young @entity32 was there at the back post to stab home			1
for @entity12 , there was a familiar name up front in @entity131 , the son of former @entity134 winger and ex manager @entity132			0
but it was his strike partner @entity53 who equalised just 120 seconds after @entity1 had gone ahead , capitalising on slack defending to roll the ball past keeper @entity26 from 16 yards			0
@entity1 edged back in front when the lively @entity32 ’s shot was beaten away by @entity143 keeper @entity142 , only for the alert @entity37 to turn home the rebound from a position prone on the ground			1
it then took a terrific point - blank save by @entity142 to prevent @entity32 adding a third before half time			2
nice surroundings : @entity1 ' pre-season tour of @entity3 is in full swing ahead of the new campaign but there was a blow when @entity1 lost @entity27 after he appeared to twist his knee			1
fellow right back @entity49 has already damaged his hamstring on this tour , meaning @entity28 was introduced with @entity36 dropping to right back			0
@entity159 would later add to @entity15 ’s woes by hobbling off injured in the second minute of ' @entity161 ' , as it was called by the @entity59 announcer			2
the second half saw @entity15 seek goals by throwing on @entity40 and @entity38 for @entity37 and @entity39 , then teenager @entity33 for @entity32			1
@entity40 very nearly grabbed a third , but was thwarted by the latest heroics by @entity142			0
but @entity143 had a few decent shots at @entity26 ’s goal themselves as @entity1 limped dismally over the line			0
for @entity15 , a consolation will be that most of the players on show wo n’t be starting the first league match at home to @entity177 later this month			2
but the @entity1 manager will surely be demanding improvement when his side wraps up their @entity3 tour when they face @entity182 on wednesday night out here in @entity14			2
enjoying pre-season , lads ? @entity38 and @entity34 rest during their training session with @entity1			0

rangers win 2 - 1 on tuesday morning in @entity14 during pre-season tour
youngster @entity32 scores and sets up @entity37 for other goal
@entity15 made 10 changes to side that beat @entity18 2 - 1
