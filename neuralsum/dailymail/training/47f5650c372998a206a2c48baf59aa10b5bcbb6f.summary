it ’s barely 11am on a sweltering saturday morning in @entity2 , and the air is thick with the smell of charred meat			1
a nearby loudspeaker blasts out @entity12 rock while , all around me , men in stetsons and sunglasses sweat over enormous steel cookers billowing smoke			2
welcome to the @entity15 – aka the ‘ @entity16 of @entity17 ’ – where it ’s never too early to fire up the grill			1
' barbecue virgin ' @entity19 gets stuck in to the @entity15 a team of butchers from @entity23 travelled to @entity2 , to barbecue with the best in the world the fierce cooking competition attracted 100,000 entrants and visitors now in its 36th year , the competition attracts more than 250 entrants who battle it out across dozens of categories – from best ribs to best chicken wings - for cash prizes of up to $ 50,000 and , ultimately , the chance to be crowned @entity37			1
teams with names such as @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 of cooking disasters have been here since thursday , setting up their stalls in preparation for today ’s extravaganza			2
the competition grounds – a mile long stretch of grass along the @entity51 – are heaving with the 100,000 barbecue fans and spectators who ’ve paid $ 10 a head to be here			1
as competition organiser @entity58 - a businesslike woman in khaki trousers and horn - rimmed glasses - puts it : ‘ this is the granddaddy of grill contests			1
’ to a barbecue virgin such as myself , it ’s all a little overwhelming			1
i ’m here because , as well as teams from virtually every @entity67 , there is one lonely @entity69 delegation , who ’ve entered two categories : beef brisket and best ribs			1
sent by the supermarket @entity23 , the nine - strong group – six men , three women , all @entity23 employees - is hoping to take on the @entity77 at their own game			2
and let ’s get one thing straight – it is very much their own game			2
because you can forget charred sausages and limp burgers - this is @entity87 in all its smoky , super-sized glory			2
here , great slabs of meat are slow - cooked over wood fires for up to 18 hours at a time			2
the fat of the meat melts slowly , keeping it tender , while the wood infuses it with flavour			2
@entity19 samples some of the delicacies the competition has to offer cooked to perfection : meat is slow cooked for up to 18 hours and judged by how tender it is @entity103 tries some of the beef brisket and ribs cooked up the @entity69 @entity23 team it ’s a culinary art dating back to the @entity108 , and every town across the @entity110 has its own version – from @entity2 ’s sticky ribs to @entity114 ’s pulled pork			1
all are represented here , cooked by teams of red - faced men armed with tongs and lots and lots of beer			2
each one has its own pitch , where they have erected their barbecue along with plastic chairs , tables , gazebos and huge tarpaulin banners bearing their team ’s name			1
most have wired up their own sound system , too – hence the @entity12 rock			2
looking around , i ca n’t help but think our @entity69 team – authentic as their beef brisket and ribs may look - stand about as much chance of winning as @entity142 at the @entity143 in 1988			2
but @entity144 , a former professional chef who now works for @entity23 ’s recipe team and is heading up the @entity69 contingent , is confident			2
‘ no matter what anyone says , we ’re here to win – and i think we can			0
’ he has been practicing since this time last year , even setting up a barbecue in the car park of @entity23 ’s @entity153 headquarters			1
by lunchtime , the aroma of pork ribs and beef brisket hanging in the air , my appetite is getting the better of me			0
disappointingly , the meat being grilled by competitors is reserved for the competition judges - but a strip of food trucks running through the middle of the site is a meat - lover ’s paradise			1
there are dozens of stalls offering everything from chicken wings and pulled pork to ribs and burgers			1
master butchers sharpen their knives ahead of the competition each of the 285 entrants have their own specialty from sticky ribs to pulled pork about 100,000 barbecue fans turn up to the competition to sample the huge range of griddled meats i plump for half a dozen ribs , slaw and beans			1
sticky and sweet , they come in an enormous plastic box			0
there ’s nothing for it but to stand in the middle of the festival grounds and tuck in			0
they ’re messy – but delicious			0
‘ this was my father ’s recipe , ’ explains @entity199 , a 44 - year - old teacher who sells the ribs from her brightly - painted wagon			0
‘ he taught me how to barbecue when i was a little girl – we ’re here every year			1
’ alongside the endless food stalls , there is all manner of barbecue - centric merchandise to be picked up			1
t - shirts emblazoned with ‘ @entity211 ’ and ‘ @entity212 ’ sell like hotcakes while elsewhere you can buy butcher ’s knives , barbecue tongs and rhinestone - encrusted cowboy hats			1
as the day wears on , and the mercury soars over @entity220 , a mood of focussed calm descends over the competitors			0
many here are seasoned hands on the barbecue circuit ( yes , there is such a thing – @entity2 ’s @entity15 is the crowning jewel in a calendar of similar events across the @entity110 , from @entity232 to the @entity233 )			1
competition is fierce and every team has its own ‘ secret ’ for success			1
this is the 10th year that @entity2 oil refinery workers @entity239 , 39 , and @entity241 , 41 , have entered			1
their team is called @entity244 , and their grill is shaped like a huge cylindrical drum			0
says @entity239 : ‘ it 's the highlight of the year			0
we enjoy cooking and there 's camaraderie between the teams			0
we 're entering the ribs - we have our own dry rub on it			0
that 's the trick - but we ca n't tell you what 's in it			0
' the seven judges allocated to each team are no less dedicated			0
in preparation for today , they have undergone eight hours of training – taking in everything from animal anatomy to lessons in meat texture			0
entrants come up with a range of imaginative names including the @entity273 and lord of the @entity17 the barbecue @entity2 meat fest is not suitable for vegetarians bbq kings : @entity278 ( left ) and @entity279 of team refined swine at the @entity16 of @entity17 judging is a complex combination on stall inspection ( teams get points for cleanliness ) and a blind taste test in an enormous tent at the heart of the festival site			1
‘ there are three things we look for : appearance , tenderness , and taste , ’ says @entity292 , a local weatherman who has been judging barbecue contests in his spare time for more than a decade			1
munching through all that meat , he says , can be daunting			0
‘ i always put on a couple of pounds at competition time – you just take two bites of each entry but you end up consuming a lot			1
’ finally , though , more than six hours after they begin , @entity292 and co are ready to give their verdict			0
as the sun sets over the banks of the @entity51 , an excitable local news anchor named @entity314 takes to a stage in the centre of the site to announce the winners			0
the top ten in each category traipse up one by one to whoops of applause and the odd yell of ' we love pork '			0
in all , the ceremony takes almost two hours - not that anyone seems to mind			0
the @entity69 team do n’t quite make it up – finishing 39th ( out of 108 ) in the beef brisket category and 67th ( of 121 ) in the pork ribs			0
those are won by @entity337 's , a group from @entity339 in @entity51 headed up by , yes , a fireman named @entity337 , and @entity341 on the @entity17 , from nearby @entity342 , respectively			0
and the @entity343 – awarded to whoever scores highest overall , regardless of category – goes to @entity347 , from @entity348 in @entity51 , who also won the @entity351 category			0
nevertheless , @entity144 and his team are satisfied : ' it 's about the learning			0
we 're competing against the kings of barbecue - and one day we 'll be one of them			1
we 'll be back next year			0
