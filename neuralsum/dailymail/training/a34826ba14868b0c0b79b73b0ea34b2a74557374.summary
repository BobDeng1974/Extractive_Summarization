but while temperatures are set to reach @entity6 ( @entity7 ) on wednesday , the @entity4 has warned that this warmth will not come with ' wall - to - wall sunshine '			1
instead there will be thunder storms and widespread cloud , causing sticky and humid conditions			0
it comes after heavy rain hit large parts of the @entity1 over the weekend , affecting the @entity18 tennis and the @entity19			2
rainy : as spectators cower underneath their umbrellas at the @entity18 grass court championships in @entity25 yesterday , more storms are on the way along with hot temperatures this week bad weather : despite the optimistic sign , festival - goers make their way through the mud at a wet and windy 2013 @entity19 over the weekend meanwhile in @entity37 , some parts of @entity35 and @entity36 have seen temperatures reach @entity38 , and it is hot air from these countries which will make the @entity1 so warm this week			1
' this is going to be a warm week and wednesday will easily be the hottest day of the year so far , ' a @entity4 spokesman said			0
' the warm weather that @entity35 and @entity36 have been experiencing recently is being dragged over @entity1			1
' we believe that temperatures will be between @entity47 and @entity6 , and will feel very warm and humid			1
' but it will not be wall - to - wall sunshine , it will be mainly cloudy with a chance of thunder storms			0
' but by the end of the week @entity1 's changeable climate will take hold again , with temperatures dropping markedly			2
' by the time we get to thursday it will feel fresher and temperatures will be between @entity60 and @entity61 , ' the spokesman said			0
heatwave : people enjoy the sunny weather at a beach in @entity66 , southern @entity35 yesterday , where large parts of @entity35 and @entity36 have had temperatures in excess of @entity38 warm : with the @entity71 in the background , children enjoy the hot weather over @entity37 by jumping into @entity74 it came as the @entity4 prepares for a major summit on @entity1 's climate , after several years of summer floods and droughts , freezing winters and even widespread snow in may this year			1
leading meteorologists and scientists will discuss one key issue : is @entity1 's often terrible weather down to climate change , or just typical ? it follows the coldest spring in more than 50 years , as well as droughts and floods in 2012 , the freezing winter of 2010 and incredibly widespread snow last month			2

' we have seen a run of unusual seasons in the @entity1 and northern @entity37 , such as the cold winter of 2010 , last year 's wet weather and the cold spring this year , ' a @entity4 spokesman said			0
' this may be nothing more than a run of natural variability , but there may be other factors impacting our weather			0
' there is emerging research which suggests there is a link between declining @entity118 sea ice and @entity37 climate - but exactly how this process might work and how important it may be among a host of other factors remains unclear			0
