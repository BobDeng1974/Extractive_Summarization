forget everything you know about cake cutting ; this new method could turn the seemingly straight - forward practice on its head			1
although , using the word ‘ new ’ is n’t accurate , because the method is actually a 100 - year - old trick unearthed by @entity10 - based author and mathematician @entity11			1
in his latest @entity13 video , @entity11 describes how taking wedges out of cakes leaves them susceptible to drying - and we should instead be cutting them in lines so the whole cake can be sealed and stored			1
in a video for @entity13 channel @entity23 , @entity21 mathematician @entity11 explained the best way to scientifically and mathematically cut a cake ( shown )			1
by cutting it in parallel lines , rather than in wedges the cake can more easily be stored without going dry , @entity11 said known on @entity13 as @entity23 , @entity11 first explained the problems with modern methods of cutting cakes			1
namely , he said that if a wedge is taken out of a cake but the rest of the food is then stored in the fridge , the edges of the cake open to the air will be ‘ dry and horrible ’ , @entity11 says			2
‘ you ’re not maximising the amount of gastronomic pleasure that you can make from this cake			0
’ there is instead , he explained , a better way of cutting cakes that dates back more than a century			0
the method was first published in @entity50 on 20 december 1906 in the letters to the editor section by @entity54 mathematical scientist @entity53			1
titled ‘ cutting a round cake on scientific principles ’ , @entity53 ’s letter explained how the ‘ ordinary method of cutting out a wedge is very faulty ’			1
he went on to state the cake should be cut in parallel lines , starting in the centre , with the rectangular segments of the cake then taken out and eaten			1
this would allow the cake to then be closed , provided it is one with icing , keep the sponge inside sealed and retaining its freshness			2
' @entity72 suggests cakes , and the wish on my part [ is ] to describe a method of cutting them that i have recently devised to my own amusement and satisfaction			2
' the problem to be solved was , " given a round tea - cake of some 5 inches across , and two persons of moderate appetite to eat it , in what way should it be cut so as to leave a minimum of exposed surface to become dry ? " ' the ordinary method of cutting out a wedge is very faulty in thi s respect			1
the results to be aimed at are so to cut the cake that the remaining portions shall fit together			0
' consequently the chords ( or the arcs ) of the circumferences of these portions must be equal			0
' the direction of the first two vertical planes of section is unimportant ; they may be parallel , as in the first figure , or they may enclose a wedge			0
' the cuts shown on the figures represent those made with the intention of letting the cake last for three days , each successive operation having removed about one - thi rd of the area of the original disc			0
' a common india - rubber band embraces the whole and keeps its segments together			0
' stop , you 're doing it all wrong ! the ' new ' method of cutting cakes was actually first described in a letter to the journal nature on 20 december 1906			2
the modern method of cutting cakes into wedges has not seemingly been under much scrutiny , but perhaps this new technique will provide a useful alternative it is also recommended an elastic band is used to hold the cake together and keep it sealed			2
‘ i do n’t know if you ’ve thought about it before but these triangular slices are really annoying anyway because it ’s not very satisfying , ’ @entity11 added			0
in reference to the new method he said having ‘ a nice uniform slice like that is a lot better			1
’ but , he concluded , most people choose to share their cakes rather than eating it themselves , meaning not much or any of it is often stored			0
‘ i think for the mathematical loners who do n’t want to share their cakes it could be useful , ’ he joked .			0

@entity10 mathematician @entity11 describes the trick in a @entity13 video
the method involves cutting parallel lines rather than wedges
this allows the cake to be sealed with icing around it , keeping it fresh
@entity53 first described the innovative method in @entity50 in 1906
and @entity11 said the ' nice uniform slice is a lot better ' than wedge - cutting
