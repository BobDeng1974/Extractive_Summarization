how @entity0 headbutted @entity1 @entity0 told sir @entity2 ' we need f * * * * * * more from you ' @entity0 says he would n't have missed a drugs test like @entity7 @entity8 sent @entity9 ' into dizzy spells ' @entity0 admits he does not regret his horror tackle on @entity12 @entity0 has slammed sir @entity2 for his dispute with @entity14 over the horse @entity15			1
the legendary @entity18 boss was embroiled in a legal battle over the ownership of the champion racehorse with @entity14 - who was part of the @entity24 investment group , @entity18 's biggest shareholders until the takeover by the @entity28 family			1
now @entity0 , in his new autobiography @entity29 , has criticised his former manager for his role in the scandal			1
sir @entity2 ( right ) pictured with @entity15 and jockey @entity33 at @entity34 in 2002 @entity0 ( left ) and @entity2 walk off following a match between @entity36 and @entity18 in 2007 ' he [ @entity2 ] was just a mascot for them - " look at me , how big i am " - and he did n't even own the bloody thing , ' wrote @entity0			1
@entity2 and @entity14 settled out of court , with the former manager accepting a £ 2.5million one - off payment			1
@entity0 has also revealed he launched an expletive - laden rant at @entity2 which ultimately led to his departure from @entity45			1
@entity0 spectacularly fell out with @entity2 following the then captain 's harsh words during an interview with @entity49 - which earned the @entity51 a £ 5,000 fine from the club			1
@entity0 reveals that assistant @entity53 accused him of showing a lack of loyalty to his team - mates after his @entity49 interview in which he tore into a number of the then @entity18 stars			1
@entity2 stepped in to quell the row , saying : ' that ’s enough			1
i ’ve had enough of all this stuff			1
@entity0 responded by saying : ' you as well gaffer			1
we need f * * * * * * more from you			1
we need a bit more , gaffer			1
we 're slipping behind other teams			1
' when goalkeeper @entity72 chipped in and suggested @entity0 could have used a ' different tone ' the reply was robust			1
' @entity72 , why do n’t you shut the f * * * up ? you ’ve been at this club for two minutes and you ’ve done more interviews than i ’ve done in my 12 years			2
it was @entity49 – i had to do it			2
' like our @entity18 facebook page			2
' once we were at @entity84 – they were playing @entity85			2
we were standing at the corner flag and @entity87 ( @entity88 ) was next to me			2
he goes : " this is great is n’t it ? "			2
i went : " i used to play in these games @entity87 "			2
i was n’t being cocky			2
' it ’s about justification , what you stand for			2
when i was at @entity18 i was getting paid good money but i could go : " yeah , but i 'm giving it back to you "			0
i did n’t feel that way with this tv work			0
it ’s an easy gig			0
i do n’t like easy gigs			0
when i heard : " i liked your commentary last night "			0
i knew i was only talking bulls * * * like the rest of them			0
hopefully my bulls * * * was a bit better			0
i wanted to do something that excited me			0
tv work did n’t excite me			0
' i liked @entity87 and @entity112 , though			0
what i really enjoyed was the company			0
i liked meeting people , old players like @entity117 ’s @entity116			0
some @entity18 fans saw us together and one of them said : “ why the f * * * are you talking to him ? ”			0
i felt like saying : “ i will speak to who i f * * * ing want to ! " ' ' i wonder about the current @entity18 dressing room			0
when a manager like sir @entity2 is replaced the new man needs a helping hand			1
does that mean every player should like him ? no. ' but i look at the current players and they should be doing a lot better			0
not liking a manager can never be an excuse for not going out and doing your best			0
' looking at what happened to @entity138 , i can only conclude that he did n’t have a strong dressing room			0
he had a weak dressing room			0
' @entity2 ( left ) and @entity0 in happier times at a press conference ahead of the @entity145 final in may 2005 @entity0 : @entity146 , published by @entity147 and @entity148 , £ 20			1
