‘ further scans were arranged to asses the extent of his disabilities but when i saw him smiling and playing inside me i knew i could n’t end his life			2
' if he could smile and play and feel then despite his disabilities he deserved to enjoy whatever life he had left , no matter how short			0
just because his life would be shorter or different , did n’t mean he did n’t deserve to experience it			0
‘ as long as he was pain free i vowed to let him enjoy his life both while inside me and outside , no matter how long that be			0

@entity7 who went through the birth of her baby , pictured in a frame , and said she did n't regret her decision ‘ i researched all his disabilities to prepare myself fully for his needs			1
i never had a moment of doubt			0

‘ not knowing how long he would live meant we were determined to enjoy him for as long as we could			0
we learned he loved the shower and would kick when i sprayed the water on my tummy			0
‘ as he grew bigger i could see his little feet and hands prodding through my bump when he wriggled			0
he may not have been born but he was already our son and i took each movement as a sign we had done the right thing			0
‘ i would talk to him and play him music because i wanted him to experience as much as possible			2
’ because of her son ’s disabilities he could n’t swallow the amniotic fluid surrounding him meaning @entity157 had to undergo painful draining procedures for the last nine weeks of her pregnancy			0
she said : ‘ it was agony and i knew some people questioned if it was worth putting myself through all this for a severely disabled baby that may not live for long			2
‘ but i never ever thought like that			0
as a mother you will do anything for your child and for me i became a mother as soon as i fell pregnant , that job had started already			0
’ and for @entity7 the rewards for her pregnancy were she says the most joyful and fulfilling nine hours of her life – the time she spent with her son			1

’ but shortly after the birth midwives burst into the delivery suite and warned @entity7 her son had just minutes to live			1
she says : ‘ i was shocked but we had already decided that after his birth we would let @entity19 lead the way			2
i did n’t want him given any unnecessary treatment if ultimately it would n’t help him			0
' he had already given me the greatest honour of being his mummy for the last nine months			0
it was up to him now if he was ready to go			0
’ @entity7 rushed to his side and finally the son she had nurtured for nine months was placed in her arms			1
she said : ‘ it was without doubt the happiest moment of my life			0
@entity19 could have died at anytime in my womb but he held on long enough for us to meet properly			2
