@entity11 , 30 , and grandmother @entity12 , 63 , say police have ignored their insistence that accused @entity2 , 47 , is not the man who attacked them in 2010 , and claim officers were more concerned with protecting the tourism industry in @entity9 than with finding the real culprit			1
both women have waived their automatic right to anonymity in order to make their objections public , over fears the same fate will befall other tourists visiting the island			2
university researcher dr @entity11 will be watching from the public gallery when local man @entity2 appears at a preliminary hearing at a @entity9 magistrates ' court tomorrow			1
retired primary school teacher mrs @entity12 is equally adamant @entity2 is not responsible for her violent attack , and that her rapist is still at large			1
the @entity9 man 's defence is being funded by former actress @entity37 , 66 , who was herself raped on the island eight years ago			1
dark side of paradise : mrs @entity12 was dragged from a path near this beach in exclusive @entity43 , @entity9 mrs @entity37 , who formally complained about the lacklustre police response to her case , had also taken the decision to waive her anonymity to claim authorities were doing nothing to warn women of the threat of sex attacks on the island , and were failing to properly investigate them when they did occur			1
dr @entity11 moved to @entity9 to take up an environmental research post at the @entity57 two years ago			1
as she walked along a narrow path to the beach on a saturday afternoon in october she was set upon by a man who dragged her into a deserted hotel building , raped her , and then fled			0
just two days later widow @entity63 , who was enjoying a holiday alone on the island , was dragged from the same beach path and raped in an identical attack			2
she was left with a broken collarbone and ribs			0
but the victims can not take any solace in the fact a man has been charged with the crime , because they are certain he is not the guilty party			2
neither dr @entity11 nor mrs @entity12 recognised @entity2 when they were shown his photograph by police			1
' when i heard him speak i just knew then it definitely was not him			0
his face is all wrong and his voice is all wrong , ' dr @entity11 told @entity82			2
both women say @entity2 is significantly older than their attacker , who they independently identified as being in his thirties			0
' they have made no effort to find him			0
that is the crux of the matter , ' mrs @entity12 told the newspaper			0
@entity91 : @entity12 , seen left after being attacked on @entity9 , and right at home on @entity93 , @entity94 , is convinced @entity2 is not the man who dragged her into a deserted hotel and raped her mrs @entity37 , who is now an addiction counsellor , moved to the island 10 years ago to take up a post at @entity99 , a charitable foundation working with drug addicts that are released from prison			1
she was asleep at her home on the island in april 2004 when she was raped at knifepoint by a masked intruder in a savage attack			0
mrs @entity37 said she had to beg for dna swabs to be taken when she went to hospital after the attack , that officers failed to gather vital evidence , and that a senior police shouted and laughed at her during a meeting			0
her attacker , @entity115 , was eventually captured after leaving his phone at the scene of another crime			0
he went on to be convicted of raping mrs @entity37 and 16 other women			0
the former actress , who waived her anonymity after learning of mrs @entity12 ' horrific ordeal on the island , said : ' when i heard about @entity12 's case i thought " my @entity127 , they have done nothing "			1
' support : former actress @entity37 ( pictured with ex-husband @entity130 ) formally complained about the police investigation carried out after she was raped on @entity9 in 2004 mrs @entity37 also described the timing of @entity2 's arrest shortly after she spoke to the press about her concerns regarding sex attacks on @entity9 as a ' strange coincidence '			1
the @entity138 has said mrs @entity37 's case had been investigated and that a response would be send to her shortly			0
both dr @entity11 and mrs @entity12 have written to the commissioner of police and the @entity142 to complain about the handling of their cases			2
police commissioner @entity146 has confirmed that the two women had contacted authorities , but added that it was ' utterly wrong ' to suggest that the country 's reputation was given priority over the welfare of visitors			2
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0

@entity2 is accused of raping @entity11 , 30 , and grandmother @entity12 , 63 , in identical attacks two days apart on the island
both alleged victims insist @entity2 is not the man who brutally assaulted them on @entity9 in 2010
they claim authorities on the island were more concerned with protecting its reputation as a tourist 's paradise than investigating the sex attacks
the woman decided to waive their automatic right to anonymity to speak out as they believe the real rapist is still at large
