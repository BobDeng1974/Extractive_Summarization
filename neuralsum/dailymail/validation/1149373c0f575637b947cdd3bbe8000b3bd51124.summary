it was the first festival we had been to and we were both excited			2

@entity9 is not the same boy he once was			2
i went through horrendous trauma , watching him in intensive care , not knowing if he would live or die			1
’ @entity19 had been saving for months for her and her partner , @entity41 , to visit the @entity42 in august 2009			1

@entity19 said : ‘ it was a real treat			2
it was my first festival - and @entity9 's too - so we were both excited			2
‘ we pitched our tent on the friday night and the following day , we went off to watch the bands			2
‘ @entity9 asked me for some money to go on a fairground ride			1
he met up with a couple of school friends too			1
he loved rides , so i knew he would be having fun			2
’ but a short time later , one of @entity9 's friends raced back to say he had fallen from a ride			1
@entity19 said : ‘ my first thought was that he was dead			2
but , when i reached him , he was awake and talking , though his ankle was badly smashed			2
‘ i really thought it was just a case of a broken ankle			0
though i was worried , i was glad that at least it was n't as serious as i 'd feared			1
‘ @entity9 lay on the ground , as we waited for an ambulance and i saw the fairground workers , picking up broken parts from the ride			1
’ @entity9 spent five days in a coma and a further ten days in hospital and missed his 15th birthday in hospital , doctors found @entity9 was bleeding internally from his main artery			1
they warned @entity19 his life was in danger			0
she said : ‘ they took me in a little room like a scene from @entity91 , and i felt as though it was happening to someone else			0
‘ they explained if they did n't operate he would bleed to death			1
‘ i was hysterical , pacing the hospital corridors for hours waiting for news			0
’ @entity9 finally came out of surgery in the early hours of the morning			0
doctors confirmed they had managed to repair a ripped aorta			0
his condition was still critical and he was taken into intensive care			1
@entity9 was rushed back into surgery following complications and then taken to a specialist children 's hospital , where he was placed in an induced coma			0
again , @entity19 was warned he faced a fight for life			0
she said : ‘ i did n't leave the hospital for a week			1
i thought i was going to lose him and it was horrific			0
’ @entity9 spent five days in a coma and a further ten days in hospital			0
his 15th birthday passed him by			0
even at home , he needed a wheelchair and was unable to look after himself			1
@entity19 said : ‘ we had to bring his bed downstairs			0
he was like an old man			0
he had major surgery on his upper body and his ankle was in pieces too , so he just could n't move			1
’ @entity9 was in a wheelchair and it was five months before he returned to school			1
@entity19 said : ‘ physically , he healed well , but he was never the same child again			0
@entity9 had always been a typical boy ; blind to danger , a real fun lover and thrill seeker			0
‘ but he became too scared to even go in a car			0
‘ to this day , he rarely goes out alone and wo n't go in a car without me			1
he has pain in his ankle and his ribs , but the main after effects of the accident are psychological			0
after his accident @entity9 was in a wheelchair and it was five months before he returned to school ‘ he has become anxious and old before his time			1
he ca n't walk past a fairground , let alone go on a ride again			1
’ in july 2014 , those responsible for @entity9 's accident were finally brought to justice			0
the @entity148 investigated the incident and found a number of serious defects which had not been picked up at either the design , testing or sign - off stages			2
the @entity148 confirmed that the accident had been preventable if the guilty parties had followed the proper procedures			2
the ride manufacturer @entity159 and examiners dr @entity160 and @entity162 were all prosecuted after pleading guilty to the safety breaches at @entity164			1
@entity159 was fined £ 3,000 and the same amount in costs after pleading guilty to breaching @entity168 of the @entity169 , while his company @entity170 was fined a further £ 2,000 and £ 3,000 costs			1
@entity171 and @entity162 were each fined £ 8,000 and both ordered to pay costs of £ 10,000 after pleading guilty to breaching @entity174 ( 1 ) of the @entity169			1
@entity19 said : ’ i am still very bitter and angry that due to their negligence i nearly lost my son			0
‘ i understand that the judge can only fine the guilty party based on their means but i am shocked that they can carry on trading in the business after showing such incompetence , especially when a safety inspector ’s job is so important to the safety of the public			2
@entity9 , pictured above with a friend , ' ca n't walk past a fairground , let alone go on a ride again			1
' ‘ i am actually disgusted that they can carry on in the same line of work and can only hope that they realise that they can not play with people 's lives			0
‘ i had to go through two weeks of hell not knowing if my son was going to come out of the operating room alive and then watching him as he lay in a coma			0
‘ after all this not a single apology has been offered our way			0
‘ i would like the public to know the dangers of travelling fairgrounds , and that despite having safety checks carried out rogue inspectors do exist			0
the could and should have been prevented			0
’ @entity19 is now pursuing a civil case against those responsible			0
her solicitor , @entity215 , of @entity216 , said : ‘ although the @entity148 secured these convictions it does not provide any justice for @entity9 so we have launched a civil claim on his behalf			0
‘ we have a very strong case , especially as all three defendants pleaded guilty as charged			1
‘ had the guilty parties been responsible and had done what they are supposed to do the accident would never have happened			2
‘ it ’s too easy for fairground owners and designers of rides to cut corners and this presents a terrible danger to the public			0
‘ @entity9 was lucky not to have been killed , but he and his mother are still suffering from the effects of this terrible accident and i am determined , along with his mother , to get him the justice her deserves while warning other fairground operators – and the general public who find these rides so popular – that they ca n’t take risks with people 's lives in order to make more money			0
