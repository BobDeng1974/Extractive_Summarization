@entity0 called for the state to change resisting arrest to a felony charge ; he is pictured above speaking at a police foundation about ' the state of the @entity7 ' event last week @entity8 should change resisting arrest to a felony charge so criminals who do so face harsher penalties , @entity7 commissioner @entity0 said today			1
increasing the punishment for the crime that can lead to ' potential injuries to the officer ' , was one of several recommendations mr @entity0 made to a joint hearing of four @entity20			2
resisting arrest is currently a misdemeanor carrying a maximum punishment of one year			1
mr @entity0 argued that was n't a significant enough penalty to deter the 2,000 criminals that resist arrest each year			1
' i think a felony would be very helpful in terms of raising the bar significantly in the penalty for the resistance of arrest , ' mr @entity0 told the @entity36			2
he said when criminals resisted arrest it could lead to both police and civilians getting injured			1
' we need to get around this idea that you can resist arrest			0
you just ca n't do it			0
it results in potential injuries to the officer , to the suspect			0
and we need to change that , and the way to change that is to start penalties for it			0
' in pushing for the change , mr @entity0 acknowledged that the charge was sometimes misused , saying ' the vast majority might end up being dismissed '			1
advocates say the charge is often the only one someone is facing , regardless of whether they actually resisted arrest , because other charges have been dismissed or dropped			2
but the commissioner said part of the push was also to get district attorneys to treat the charge ' more seriously '			0
he said the charge would be better tracked to see how often it was being dropped			0
about 2,000 criminals a year resist arrest which mr @entity0 said led to both officers and civilians being injured mr @entity0 also called for harsher penalties for fatally assaulting an officer , school safety agent or auxiliary officer			1
improved safety measures called for by the commissioner included bulletproof glass for police cars , stiffer penalties for publicizing an officer 's personal details and tighter controls around motorists tinting their windows .			0

about 2,000 criminals are charged each year with resisting arrest
@entity92 leads to injuries to both police and civilians , @entity7 boss claims
@entity0 acknowledged the charge could be misused by police
he said the push was also aimed at making @entity102 's ' take it more seriously '
