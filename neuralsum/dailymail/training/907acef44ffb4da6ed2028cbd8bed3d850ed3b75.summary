poverty levels in the @entity2 have fallen to levels last seen more than two decades ago , new figures showed today			1
the number of people in relative poverty has fallen by 100,000 over the past year to 9.7 million			1
overall , 15 per cent of people were in relative poverty last year , the lowest level since the 1980s			1
the official figures were released by the @entity10			0
they show how relative poverty - measured as living on 60 per cent of median average incomes - has been falling gradually since 2008 - 09 in the wake of the financial crash			1
before housing costs are taken into account , the number of people living below the threshold has fallen by 100,000 over the past year to 9.7 million			1
in 2007 - 08 the figure hit 11million			0
median incomes remained broadly unchanged between 2011/12 and 2012/13 , up £ 2 to £ 440 a week for a couple with no children			0
work and pensions secretary @entity24 said : ' despite the deepest debt - fuelled recession in living memory when £ 112 billion was wiped off the economy , we have protected the most vulnerable families from falling behind with 300,000 fewer children in poverty since 2010			1
' today 's figures underline the need to stick to the government 's long - term economic plan of restoring a strong economy that creates jobs , and a tax and welfare system that helps people into work and makes work pay			1
' however , the percentage of people in absolute low income after housing costs has increased slightly to 23 per cent , the highest it has been since 2001 - 02			2
among children , 17 per cent are in relative low income before housing costs , the lowest level since the 1980s , although it has not fallen in the last year			1
@entity55 's @entity54 , shadow work and pensions secretary , said : ' these figures show the government 's child poverty strategy is failing abysmally with no progress for the millions of children still living in poverty			2
' they also include extremely worrying signs that rising housing costs are set to push more children into poverty and that severe poverty is on the rise			2
' the @entity71 campaign group said the statistics also showed a steep rise in child poverty for single parent households where the parent works full - time , climbing from 17 per cent of households where the single parent works full - time in poverty in 2011 - 12 to 22 per cent in 2012 - 13			2
work and pensions secretary @entity24 said the figures showed that the government had protected the most vulnerable families from falling behind almost one in four children whose single mother or father works full - time is now growing up poor , while nearly one in three with a single parent working part - time is in poverty , said the group			1
gingerbread chief executive @entity92 said : ' it is deeply concerning that while the economy is on the up , hundreds of thousands of families remain trapped into poverty			2
' for far too many single parent families , work offers no real promise of escape from hardship , as today 's figures show a rise in working poverty where a single mum or dad is working full - time			2
' @entity109 general secretary @entity108 said : ' today 's figures clearly show why living standards are falling			0
while wages have stagnated , and benefits and tax credits have been cut , prices have been rising - especially the cost of housing			0
' since the last election a million more adults and half a million more children fell into absolute poverty when housing costs are taken into account			1
' without a major affordable home building programme and action to secure fair wages , this type of poverty will continue to grow			0
' @entity128 , chief executive of the @entity129 , said : ' today 's figures show that we are not making sufficient progress into tackling high levels of poverty , despite rising employment and economic recovery			0
' the return to lasting economic growth and long - term prosperity will be hampered if we fail to address the levels of poverty in the @entity2			0
we know that individual policies which tinker around the edges do not reduce poverty			0
' we need a comprehensive strategy that gets to grips with low pay , the high cost of essentials and reform to the tax and benefits system to ensure work is a route out of poverty			0
' prime minister @entity154 's official spokesman said : ' child poverty remains at its lowest level since the 1980s			1
it has fallen by 300,000 since 2009/10			0
' does the government want to continue to do more in this area ? of course			0
' absolutely at the heart of improving prosperity across the country and for all is the importance of sticking to the long - term economic plan , because at the heart of dealing with poverty is work			0
' the spokesman added : ' in terms of wider poverty , the target established under the previous government is one of relative income , and that stands at its lowest level since 1982			1

number of people in relative poverty fell by 100,000 last year to 9.7 million
15 *%* of people were in relative poverty , the lowest level since the 1980s
