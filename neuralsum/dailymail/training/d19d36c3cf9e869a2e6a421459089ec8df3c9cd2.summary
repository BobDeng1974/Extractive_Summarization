by @entity0 published : 11:06 est , 25 october 2013 updated : 12:25 est , 25 october 2013 @entity2 's cook books have topped the @entity4 bestseller list for the last two years but can he retain his title as top tv chef with this year 's offering , save with @entity2 ? his latest cook book , published by @entity10 , contains recipes showing families how they can cook ' tasty , nutritious food on a budget '			1
released in august , it has already had strong sales - even outselling popular fiction such as @entity20 's latest @entity19 novel , @entity21			0
king of sales : @entity2 has had the best selling @entity4 book for the last two years and is in the running again with @entity8 with @entity2			1
but could @entity25 take his crown with his pies and @entity29 cookbook ? so it 's no surprise @entity2 's book is expected to make it into thousands of stockings this @entity4			1
but @entity35 believe they can topple the ' naked chef ' off his perch with their contender for the @entity4 number one - @entity39 's @entity25			1
his latest recipe book , @entity42 , was released this week and the publishers expect sales to soar off the back of the popularity of the @entity48 show			2
bake off dominance : a recipe book tied in with the popular fourth series of the show is already on sale , left , while a ' @entity55 ' edition will be published in november			1
there are also plans to publish recipes from this year 's finalists the book includes recipes for savoury dishes such as meat and potato pie , rosemary suet pudding , and sausage plait as well as sweet treats like queen of puddings and ' chocolate volcanoes '			2
but @entity71 will face stiff competition from other titles associated with the baking show that has made him a household name			0
in november , @entity39 : @entity77 , by @entity78 will hit the shelves			0
the book , published by @entity81 , will contain recipes for pies , breads , soups and casseroles , as well as ' showstopping ' @entity4 dinner and dessert ideas			1
the winter recipe edition follows the success of the @entity48 book , @entity89 , launched over the summer to coincide with the start of series four			0
healthier options : @entity97 's @entity96 will appeal to those who want a guilt free treat while @entity101 's @entity100 will help you get your five - a - day contender : @entity105 's @entity104 is also expected to be a festive hit featuring recipes from @entity109 and @entity71 ( again ) , it contains some of the signature bakes , technical challenges and showstoppers they set for this year 's contestants			0
after 9.1m tuned in to watch the final of the show on tuesday , the book could see a resurgence in sales before @entity4 from fans suffering withdrawal symptoms			1
meanwhile , the @entity39 website states that recipes from the finalists - @entity124 , @entity125 and winner @entity126 - will be available in november			0
but they they do reveal if this will be in an entirely new recipe book or an updated version of the bake off everyday title			1
but it 's not all about @entity39 and @entity2			2
other recipe books expected to be festive bestsellers include @entity97 's @entity137 to @entity138			0
the @entity140 published cookbook features ways to create lower fat versions of indulgent foods including a reinvention of her chocolate brownies			0
also hoping to corner the market of healthy eaters is @entity149 with his book released this month , @entity100			0
the recipe tome follows on from the success of his @entity153 - but is n't predicted to shift as many copies as @entity2 or @entity71 's offerings			2
meanwhile , other contenders for the @entity4 number one include @entity105 's @entity104 , which has already topped the charts on @entity160 since it was published in august , and @entity162 's @entity161			1
it 's a recipe for success for publishers with @entity35 revealing this week that they 've already seen a rise in profits thanks to cookery titles .			0

@entity2 has had the bestselling book at @entity4 for last two years
