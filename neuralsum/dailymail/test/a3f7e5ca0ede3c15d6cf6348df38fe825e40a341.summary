that 's the advice of @entity3 to @entity4 as the young @entity6 star weighs up his international future			1
the @entity13 defender , on loan from @entity9 until the end of the season , knows the predicament that faces the teenager torn between representing the @entity16 or @entity17			1
@entity3 has experienced an identical international limbo before			1
@entity3 ( left ) says @entity4 should follow his heart when choosing @entity20 or @entity17 in 2012 , a year after his big move from @entity22 to the club he supported as a boy - @entity9 - the @entity25 - born full - back chose the @entity17 despite having played for @entity26 , the nation of his mother , at @entity29 and under 21 level			1
it was n't a decision @entity3 took lightly , but it is one he firmly believes was the right decision			1
and now the @entity13 star , 23 , is advising boy - of - the - moment @entity4 to also do what feels right for him			1
' you ’ve got to follow your heart , ' he said , speaking exclusively to @entity40			1
' follow where you feel like you belong and play for them			2
that would be my advice			2
' that ’s what i did with the whole @entity17 - @entity26 situation			1
@entity26 were great to me when i was younger and i really enjoyed playing for them			1
the @entity6 midfielder ( centre right ) has been an instant hit since breaking into the first team ' it was a great experience at the time because i was playing against some of the best teams in the world			1
i was only in the @entity22 reserves yet i was going off to be against all these different countries			2
it was fantastic for me and i really enjoyed it			2
' but then it came to a crunch time where i had to pick and i had to ask myself : " what do i feel – @entity67 or @entity26 ? " the answer was @entity67			1
i was born in @entity67 and i feel @entity67 , so that was the decision i made			2
' i do n’t know @entity4 but my advice to him would be to follow what feels right			1
i ’m sure he will			2
' the clock is ticking for @entity73 to make up his mind with @entity20 boss @entity76 understood to be keen to include him in his plans for the friendly against @entity80 's @entity17 in @entity81 this summer			1
the young winger played for @entity20 at youth level but can still play for the @entity17 senior side @entity3 's superb form at @entity13 this season has propelled him back into the international reckoning , meanwhile			1
an established fixture in the @entity91 set - up , the towering defender has earned calls to reclaim a place in the senior side			2
he is patient , however , despite his burning desire to add to the one cap he collected against @entity97 almost three years ago when he came on as a substitute			0
@entity3 harbours an ambition to lead his country to glory at this summer 's @entity102 in @entity103 , hoping to catch @entity80 's eye with next year 's senior euros not far away			1
@entity3 was in the same predicament as @entity73 when he had to choose between @entity26 and @entity17 ' it is a massive opportunity for us , ' he said			1
' i think @entity80 will be watching all the games and having a keen look at all the players			0
the senior euros are a year after , so this will be a great chance for us to go and impress			0
' when i speak to the lads , because i stay in touch with quite a few of them , everyone ca n’t wait for it			0
' it ’s a massive stage and something that we ’ve worked hard for			0
we ’re confident in ourselves			0
we feel that we can go there and really give it a good go			0
@entity80 and his staff are believed to be fans of the young winger and want him to commit to @entity17 ' we ’ve shown in the friendlies we ’ve played recently , like against @entity133 and @entity103 , and we ’ve beaten them			1
we know we can do it			0
it ’s just about going there this summer and reproducing it			0
' obviously that ’s something in the past that we ’ve struggled with as a nation			0
but what a better time to change it and what a great thing it would be to go and win it			0
' for now , @entity3 is focused on revitalising @entity13 's season			1
having started so impressively , reaching the top four at @entity149 , the wheels have fallen off since the turn of the @entity152			0
@entity3 took part in a short film for @entity155 promoting # @entity157 competition in their past 11 @entity159 games , the @entity13 have won only once - and that was courtesy of a last minute winner at home to struggling @entity164 a month ago			1
the @entity13 play @entity165 at @entity166 on saturday , their @entity168 rivals who are fighting for their lives at the foot of the table			1
@entity3 expects it wo n't be a pretty affair but is confident @entity176 's side can produce the goods to kickstart their charge for an eighth place finish			1
manager @entity176 also took part and he can be seen preparing to throw a dart @entity182 ( from left ) , @entity183 and @entity184 laugh at their team - mates attempts ' team like @entity165 are probably even harder than playing teams who are in the top half at this stage			2
it ’s always the same towards the end of the season , ' he said			0
' they all pick up points because they ’re fighting for their lives at the end of the day – now we ’ve got to be aware of that and we need to be ready for that			0
' it ’s going to be a proper scrap at the weekend			0
but we ’ll have to dig in if we want to get a result			0
@entity206 looks on as he attempts to score high in the @entity155 darts competition at the training ground @entity3 showed he 's not just a bad footballer with some impressive dart scoring ' i think @entity212 are only four points ahead of us			2
that would be a fantastic season if we could finish in eighth			0
' of course , you just want to finish in the top half			0
anything below that would be a disappointment , especially considering how we started and i think everyone would agree with that			0
' that eighth place is within reach			0
’ @entity3 's club future remains uncertain beyond this season but he appears to be happy at the @entity13			1
he took part in the club 's darts competition , organised by the club 's sponsors @entity155 , who also front the @entity237 , earlier this week - and you can watch the footage exclusively at @entity40 , here			0
@entity3 was speaking exclusively to @entity241 at the launch of @entity155 ’s # @entity244 competition			2
@entity13 fans are invited to come up with darts nicknames for their favourite players to be in with a chance of meeting the team at the @entity251 final at the @entity252 on may 21			2
