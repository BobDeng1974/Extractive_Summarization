by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 the 101st @entity2 begins in @entity3 on saturday with @entity5 's @entity4 aiming to defend the winner 's yellow jersey he claimed last year			1
@entity4 became only the second @entity8 - after sir @entity9 in 2012 - to win the @entity2 , and he did so in it 's 100th edition			1
here , @entity11 takes a look at this year 's @entity2 and tells you everything you need to know about the biggest cycling race in the world			1
geared up : @entity3 will host the @entity17 of the @entity2 on saturday ready : sky employees from @entity19 unveil the world 's biggest jersey ahead of the @entity22 brits on show there are some notable @entity5 riders who will not be riding the @entity2 this year due to injury , illness or non-selection : four brits will line - up in @entity19 on saturday as the 101st edition of the @entity2 begins			1
@entity4 ( @entity32 ) ' @entity33 ' is the pre-race favourite to defend the leader 's yellow jersey he won last year			2
the 29 - year - old 's versatility on the climbs and in time - trial stages should give him a great chance of winning but , although he won the @entity40 for the second consecutive year , he has suffered from injuries and illness recently that could harm his chances			2
@entity44 ( @entity45 ) the @entity44 will be looking to gather as many stage wins as possible as he goes in search of a second green points jersey ( he previously won it back in 2011 )			1
@entity44 , 29 , has already claimed 25 individual stage wins on the @entity2 and he will hope to add to that on saturday			1
@entity52 ( @entity32 ) the 28 - year - old @entity53 has raced on both the track and the road but he will be expected to work hard to try and deliver @entity4 to a second successive @entity2 win			1
@entity57 ( @entity58 ) a surprise selection ahead of his twin brother @entity61 , 21 - year - old @entity59 will make his @entity2 debut hoping to push @entity58 towards stage victories			1
favourite : @entity32 's @entity5 rider @entity4 has a great chance of retaining his yellow jersey ready : @entity44 has been cycling the route of saturday 's @entity17 of the @entity2 brit : @entity52 will ride the @entity70 , hoping to lead @entity4 to overall victory debut : @entity57 was a surprise inclusion for this year 's @entity2 so will hope to impress @entity73 @entity74 covered by riders 21 - number of stages on the @entity2 ( six mountain stages and one time trial ) 3 - stages to be held in @entity80 4 - number of countries that the @entity2 will visit ( @entity80 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 ) @entity86 viewers ( in 190 different countries ) 22 - different teams ( 18 of which are @entity91 teams , four are wild - cards ) 198 - riders taking part in the tour the @entity2 starts on saturday and lasts until july 27			1
it comprises 21 stages and covers 3,664km in total			2
stages one to three will take place in @entity80			2
the @entity2 begins with a 190km stage between @entity19 and @entity102 , then on day two it travels 201km between @entity103 and @entity104 , and on its third day in @entity80 the riders will cycle 155km from @entity106 to @entity107			1
such is the wide scope of the @entity2 , this year 's route will see the riders visit four countries in all : @entity80 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84			1
there are six mountain stages this year ( of which five are summit finishes ) and just one time trial ( 54km race during stage 20 )			1
why does the @entity2 start in @entity80 ? areas have to bid for the right to host stages of the @entity2 and , essentially , whichever proposals are the best financially and practically will be awarded with stages			1
the majority of the @entity2 still takes place in @entity82 but stages are hosted elsewhere due to the prestige of the event itself and the tourism it can attract to areas such as @entity3			1
this is the fourth @entity2 to contain stages in @entity80 after the 1974 , 1994 and 2007 editions			1
bid : areas have to put forward proposals to host stages and @entity5 have three in 2014 streets : @entity32 practise on the cobbled roads of @entity3 ahead of the tour jerseys why are riders competing for different jerseys ? each colour jersey rewards different types of cyclists			1
the best rider in each of those categories is given the right to wear that jersey while riding the @entity2 and the jerseys are awarded individually at the end of each stage			1
what are the different jerseys ? leader : the yellow jersey is awarded to the rider who has the lowest time in the general classification yellow - the maillot jaune is awarded to the rider who is leading the general classification - has the quickest overall time so far in the race - and is the most prestigious of all the jerseys			2
@entity164 is awarded to the rider who is the most consistent finisher , which tends to mean it favours the sprinters due to it being more heavily weighted towards flat stages			2
the winner on a sprint stage collects 45 points , a medium mountain stage 30 points , and on high mountains or individual time trial stages just 20 points			1
points are also awarded at intermediate sprints during stages ( 20 points for first place down to one point for the 15th rider )			2
@entity186 is awarded to the best climber			0
points are gained by reaching the tops of hills or mountains first , with steeper hills rewarded with a greater number of points			0
points are awarded on a sliding scale like with the green jersey			0
@entity198 is awarded to the best placed rider aged 25 or under in the general classification			0

always in green : @entity206 @entity205 is looking to win his third straight points classification teams @entity209 @entity210 @entity211 @entity212 @entity214 - @entity213 @entity215 @entity216 ( wild - card team ) @entity218 ( wild - card team ) @entity220 @entity222 - @entity221 @entity223 @entity225 - @entity224 @entity226 @entity227 ( wild - card team ) @entity45 @entity58 @entity229 @entity230 @entity231 ( wild - card team ) @entity233 @entity234 @entity235 @entity32 cycling can appear to be a very individual sport what with one person seemingly claiming over-all victory , but nothing could be further from the case			0
the plaudits go to the winner but it takes a real team effort for @entity4 or @entity9 to get to a position where they can win a @entity249			0
there are 22 teams in the @entity2 , 18 of which are @entity91 teams ( they compete in a race circuit @entity253 ) and there are also four wild - cards ( who are allowed entry to the tour without competing on the rest of the circuit )			1
each team comprises nine riders , meaning 198 cyclists will line - up in @entity19 on saturday what are team leaders ? a team leader is the person most likely to win the @entity2 , or to claim stage victories			1
each team has a designated team leader who , in the case of @entity32 , is defending champion @entity4			0
he will wear the number one on his jersey as the defending champion			0
what are domestiques ? @entity4 's team - mates will wear numbers two through nine and they will be his ' domestiques '			0
a domestique is a support rider who cycles for his team leader			0
they effectively do the donkey work to deliver stage victories or to protect their lead riders			1
in @entity32 , @entity5 's @entity52 will act as one of @entity4 's domestiques and will be expected to protect and shield his leader			0
alongside @entity52 , @entity292 , @entity293 , @entity294 , @entity295 , @entity296 , @entity297 and @entity298 will also look to help @entity4 to glory			0
if @entity4 was to succumb to injury or misfortune then porte would likely move up to team leader			0
@entity44 also has domestiques , but they will look to deliver him to the final sprint of the stages he is targeting winning before letting the @entity308 do the rest			0
together as one : teams play a vital role in the @entity2 and it is not at all an individual event prize money if the overall race leader needs to take a toilet break then the peleton will slow to allow him to catch - up			1
the yellow jersey holder entering into the final stage will be allowed by other riders to win the race as long as he can complete the last stage unscathed			2
the peloton will often slow to allow riders involved in a crash , or who have been the subject of sabotage , to catch up			0
overall winner of the tour £ 357,000 ( usually split between the nine riders in a team - it is a @entity2 tradition that the overall winner will share the pot with his team - mates )			1
individual stage winners £ 20,000			2
polka dot jersey winner £ 20,000			0
best young rider winner £ 20,000			0
what role do sponsors play ? most team names - for example @entity32 - are based around a sponsor 's branding due to the huge investment			0
often riders who win stages will point to their sponsors in order to give them prominence on tv or in photographs			0
on show : the brands of the chief sponsors are emblazoned on the jerseys of the riders terminology peloton the peloton is the main bunch of riders on a given stage			2
riders tend to conserve energy by bundling close together and taking it in turns to lead the pack			0
drafting drafting or slipstreaming is where riders will try and form a line directly behind one another in order to benefit from the slipstream in front and to conserve energy			0
team - mates may take turns in leading a group because of this , or a rider may attempt to follow a rival closely to also benefit from this			0
breaks a ' break ' is when one or more riders have split from the main peloton and opened out a lead on the main pack			0
@entity17 the ' @entity17 ' is the first stage of the @entity2			1
@entity397 an individual time trial is where a cyclist will race against clock by themselves around a stage			2
there is only one time trial on this year 's @entity2 - a 54km road time trial during @entity407			1
the riders will set off intermittently in order of their positioning in the general classification times			0
rest days there will be two rest days on the tour which are days when there is no cycling at all			2
the first will take place on july 15 after the 10th stage , and the second will take place on july 21 after the 15th stage			2
grouped : the peloton is the main bunch of riders throughout a stage of a race climbs climbs in the @entity2 are ranked depending on their difficulty and steepness of their gradient			1
category one climbs tend to be the hardest , with @entity435 the easiest , although ' hors categorie ' climbs are even more difficult than category ones			0
difficulty : the gradient of a climb determines which ' category ' it is			0

the 101st edition of @entity2 starts in @entity3 on saturday
the first stage , or @entity17 , is 190km between @entity19 and @entity102
