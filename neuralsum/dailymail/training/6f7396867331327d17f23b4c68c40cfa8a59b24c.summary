by @entity0 @entity1 : 14:22 est , 27 december 2013 @entity2 : 18:08 est , 27 december 2013 more than three decades after the deadly eruption of @entity4 in @entity5 , an undeveloped roll of film resurfaced at a local newspaper containing never before seen images of the volcano on the eve of the deadly blast			1
the rare prints were discovered by a staffer at @entity15			0
they were taken in 1980 by newspaper photographer @entity17 , who perished while covering the eruption just weeks later			1
the black - and - white images showing the cauldron of the volcano belching out clouds of thick black smoke were captured by @entity24 from a helicopter in april			1
discovery : this photo of a simmering @entity4 was taken five weeks before the may 1980 eruption by the columbian photographer @entity17 , but it was never developed and forgotten until this year forgotten : @entity24 shot the photos from a helicopter during a flyover , but when he got back , he put the roll of film aside without processing it five weeks later , on the morning of may 18 , 1980 , the conical summit of @entity4 towering 9,600 feet above sea level burst open following an earthquake			1
tragic death : photojournalist @entity17 , 27 , was among the 57 people who perished in the blast within minutes , the north face of the symmetrical peak collapsed , spewing volcanic ash and unleashing rivers of hot mud and scorching pumice that obliterated everything in their path			1
the violent eruption lasted nine hours , causing catastrophic damage to the surrounding area and claiming 57 lives - among them the @entity15 photojournalist @entity17			2
@entity24 , 27 , was at @entity58 when the explosion happened			0
his body was discovered four days later inside his car , which was buried up to the windows in ash			0
with the turmoil following the eruption , the deadliest of its kind in @entity70 history , most people at the newspaper forgot about @entity24 's trip to the volcano five weeks prior			2
when he returned from the flyover in april , the young photojournalist set aside the roll of film he shot depicting the smoking conical summit			0
the undeveloped pictures had lingered in a film canister until the newspaper â€™s photo assistant @entity80 came upon it while going through a studio storage box in search of other images			2
the stunning discovery of the long - lost prints came about after @entity87 had received a request from a geology book author asking her to find a certain photo from the day of the eruption			0
the staffer was unable to track down the print in question , but she did stumble upon some of @entity24 's old negatives - and among them the undeveloped roll of film			0
caught by surprise : @entity24 's body was found four days later inside his car buried in several feet of volcanic ash catastrophe : the powerful blast sheared off the mountain 's summit , sending piles of ash and rock into the air when the historic black - and - white prints were finally processed , everyone at the paper was stunned to see @entity4 the way it looked 33 years ago , with its summit intact			1
@entity24 's widow , @entity117 , who still works for @entity15 , told the station @entity118 she was elated to discover one more piece of her late husband 's legacy .			0
