widow @entity2 , 82 , armed herself with a wooden truncheon and confronted @entity12 as he brandished a tree branch after a late night bust up			1
during the ensuing scuffle , retired accountant mr @entity12 fell and claimed he was beaten by his elderly neighbour as he lay on the floor and he had to be taken to hospital with a head wound			1
a court heard the elderly neighbours were locked in a long running feud lasting 12 years but mrs @entity2 was a ' no nonsense ' woman who ' would not be intimidated			1
' today she showed no emotion as she admitted affray but was spared a jail term after a judge was told the warring pair had now called a truce			1
@entity30 was told the row was the climax of a long running fall out in which police had previously been called out to reports of trouble at the pensioners ’ £ 150,000 properties in @entity39 , near @entity40 , @entity41			1
miss @entity42 prosecuting said on the evening of april 18th last year at 11.30pm mr @entity12 was getting ready for bed when his security light at the front of the property came on			1
miss @entity42 added : ' he looked out and saw the defendant standing on the street opposite the address			2
' he did n’t know what she was doing so he went to confront her and decided to arm himself with a tree branch in case he needed to defend himself			2
' he went outside and shouted something to the defendant			2
she walked back into her property and took a wooden truncheon which she keeps by the front door and went back outside and a confrontation took place between the two			2
both of them were armed			2
' there was confrontation and mr @entity12 fell to the floor and was struck while he was on the floor			2
both mrs @entity2 and mr @entity12 each say that the other struck the first blow			1
mr @entity12 fell to the floor and was hit by @entity70 when he was on the floor			2
' the police were called and she was arrested and was interviewed and said that her security light had come on			1
in the interview she said she went and got the truncheon for her defence and she accepts that			2
' mrs @entity2 originally faced an allegation of wounding mr @entity12 with intent to do him grievous bodily harm but the charge was reduced to threatening unlawful violence			1
at war : the £ 150,000 bungalows in @entity85 , @entity39 belonging to @entity2 and @entity86			1
the incident took place outside in the street one character reference read to the court said : ' she would not be intimidated and will protect her possessions if needs be			1
she was acting in self - defence			1
' she will not stand any nonsense and she should have the right to enjoy her final years in peace			1
at the very least she can stand up for herself			2
' in mitigation defence counsel @entity99 : ' for the last 12 years mrs @entity2 who is fiercely independent has been blighted by this neighbour			1
' in relation to the incident , it is a tragedy for both sides			2
mr @entity12 has had a most unfortunate injury and ended up being taken to hospital and the defendant had the unpleasant experience of going to court on numerous occasions			2
mr @entity12 's wife @entity111 said today : ' it was a full moon that night and she ’s always odd when there ’s a full moon			2
' ' she has been back at the property and subject to a curfew from 7am until 7pm			0
she is a keen ballroom dancer and she has not been able to attend			0
she has lost her good character and she is going to be in the newspaper which is a shame for her			0
' the court needs to be assured that this will not happen again			0
' he added : ' it looks as though there was as scuffle and the police were called to try and calm down the situation			1
' the neighbours ’ dispute , in my opinion , has been fuelled by both sides and i do n’t wish to criticise mr @entity12 but he should not have gone out			0
' ' mrs @entity2 was outside her own property on the far side of the road			1
he should never have armed himself with a weapon and he should never have gone outside			0
' it took place by mrs @entity2 ’s own front gate			1
all she needed to do was shut and lock the door			0
the consequences were unpleasant for both sides			0
' mrs @entity2 has had 14 months time elapse , if anything was likely to spark a repetition it would have happened			1
' they have managed to maintain a truce and she does n’t want any repetition			1
' mrs @entity2 was ordered to complete a two year community order with a supervision requirement and was ordered to pay £ 500 costs			1
passing sentence judge @entity155 said : ' there is a background of animosity between you both			0
' on the night in question your neighbour , the complainant , saw his security light come on and saw you were standing on the street opposite his address and decided to go out and confront you and armed himself with a branch which he took from the side of the house			0
' he shouted at you and you returned to your house to pick up a wooden truncheon you kept behind your front door and went back outside			0
‘ it was plainly wrong and it was wrong to take that wooden truncheon outside your house to meet with the complainant			0
' it was a decision which you should not have taken			0
you should not have taken that step or gone back out onto the street			0
what happened after was an extremely unpleasant incident and the complainant suffered extremely unpleasant injuries thereafter			0
' you do not bear criminal responsibility for this and the @entity187 could not say how these injuries were sustained			0
the criminal responsibility is taking the truncheon out into the street			0
' you are 82 and are not just of a good character but of an exemplary character			0
you have worked all your working life and moved to the area after you lost your husband			0
' you are someone who is kind , caring and considerate			0
surrounding yourself by people who think that you have done nothing wrong , that is unhelpful position to place yourself in			0
' you need to accept that whatever the rights or wrongs , taking a weapon out onto the street could not be justified			0
' mr @entity12 's wife @entity111 said today : ' it was a full moon that night and she ’s always odd when there ’s a full moon			0
' speaking at her home , the former nurse , 78 , said : ' that woman knows how to push @entity12 ’s buttons			1

the pair had been locked in 12 - year feud but have now called a truce
@entity30 heard @entity2 was a ' no nonsense ' woman who would ' not be intimidated '
she admitted affray but has been spared jail
