from spiders reflected in dew drops nestled on their webs , to ladybirds wearing droplets like backpacks , an @entity1 photographer has managed to perfectly capture the intricate and delicate qualities of nature			1
during walks in @entity1 wetlands , @entity10 captured wasp spiders , primrose flowers , moths and ladybirds through early morning dew droplets			1
the 39 - year - old photographer spent hours working out the best angles and distances to capture nature reflected in all its glory			1
the intricate shots were taken by 39 - year - old @entity1 photographer @entity10 during early morning walks in wetlands around the @entity26 region of @entity1			1
the macro photographs were captured first thing in the morning using a @entity30 camera			1
this photo shows a wasp spider reflected in dew drops nestled on its spiral orb web all the images were shot using a @entity30 camera , with a focal length of 40mm and a two - second shutter speed			1
previously , mr @entity10 has used the same equipment and processes to capture damselflies , and snails on lilypads			1
he compared the dew drops reflected in the spider ’s web to a fairground hall of mirrors			1
the wasp spider is a species of orb - web spider found across @entity51 and @entity52			1
it gets its name from the yellow , black and white striped on its large abdomen			0
the spider builds its spiral webs at sunrise , or sunset			2
to kill its prey , the female of the species wraps flies and other small insects in silk before biting them			0
this bite paralyses the prey and begins dissolving protein in its body			0
mr @entity10 spotted the insects on an early morning walk through the wetlands around the @entity26 region of @entity1			1
the photographer , from @entity79 , said : ‘ i love to take pictures early in the morning surrounded by the sounds of nature			2
‘ i go to this spot many times a week and on this occasion left my car beside the road and walked through a path into the woods			0
‘ in the beginning it was tough to find the insects , but after 10 years of taking pictures , i 've trained my eyes to discover them between the flowers			2
i love the reflections in the drops of dew on the spiderwebs			2
‘ sometimes i saw spiders cleaning their webs , making the dew fall off			1
‘ flying insects wait to dry their wings before moving away and this is the perfect moment to take pictures of them			0
‘ you must have a lot of good combinations to take a perfect picture , like the right humidity , light and there should be absolutely no wind			0
‘ but the most difficult thing to work with is the position of the insects , which i normally find hidden between branches and bushes			0
‘ for the drops of dew it 's better to take pictures of the smallest ones as these are the perfect spheres			2
and he admitted that finding the perfect reflection is the most difficult task when taking such detailed macro photographs			1

he uses focus stacking - a digital process that uses multiple images to create a greater field of depth - to produce the focus effect ‘ you have to find the perfect position with the right angulation and the perfect distance from the lens and the subject , ’ explained the photographer			1
‘ but once you have learned to do so you can see the reflex with your own eyes and not only through the camera			0
‘ i think the fact you can see the insects reflected in each droplet is a normal physical effect because the drops have the same effect of a fisheye lens			0
‘ the first time i saw this i was really surprised and usually people think that the pictures must use @entity187 but it is n't so , it 's all done by nature			0
’ previously , mr @entity10 has used the same process to capture damselflies , snails on lilypads , moths with a primrose flower reflected in a droplet on its back ( pictured left ) , and a spider sat on a droplet ( right )			1
focus stacking helps to highlight to highlight the detail of the insect , the flower it is on , and the dew , for example mr @entity10 ( pictured ) said : ‘ you must have a lot of good combinations to take a perfect picture , like the right humidity , light and there should be absolutely no wind			1

mr @entity10 added : ‘ the big eyed damselflies have a nice face and look funny but it would be better not to see them when they open their mouth			2
‘ they are ferocious predators with the other insects			0
