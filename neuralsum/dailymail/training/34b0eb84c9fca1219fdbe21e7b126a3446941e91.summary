by @entity0 published : 10:23 est , 1 may 2013 updated : 01:51 est , 2 may 2013 this is the heart - wrenching moment that a baby elephant stands by her dead mother ’s side trying to wake her up			1
the desperate calf nudges her mother with her trunk in an attempt to elicit a response			2
eventually she accepts that her mother has died , but refuses to leave her side , keeping watch over the body for hours in the long grass of @entity17 ’s @entity16			1
it is thought the elephant slowed down and collapsed at the back of herd - the reason for her death is unclear			2
marks on her body are thought to be lions attempting to maul the body before the herd retraced their steps to find the missing elephant - they can be seen loitering in the grasses			0
wildlife photographer @entity46 captured the elephants saying their final farewells late last year			0
@entity46 , 38 , said : ' it is always sad to hear another gracious giant has passed			0
' i had a lump in my throat as i watched on			0
we were all in complete shock over the incredible behaviour that we were witnessing			0
mourning : the elephants gather in a mourning circle as they take in the loss of the elder elephant farewell : the elephant lifts her trunk as she is forced to say her final goodbye to her mother realisation : the dead elephant can be seen on its side as the herd encircle the body leaving : even as the other elephants move away the baby prolongs its final moment with its mother ' it was an incredibly moving and emotionally charged moment			1
' the young elephant simply refused to move from her mother ’s side , occasionally feeling her body with her trunk			1
' it became apparent that this elephant was really affected by her mother ’s death			1
' as the elephants that had congregated moved closer , some again touched her body with their trunks , while others just stood in silence and mourned their loss			0
heartbroken : the elephant reluctantly leaves its mother behind after the attack as the herd move away gazing with a curiosity and apparent sadness , the herd gently prod and circle their fallen leader			2
following the solemn procession , the herd moves off , leaving the baby to grieve alone by her mother 's side			1
she sits with her mother as the day draws to a close , continuing to affectionately nudge her trunk			0
even when there is an unwelcome arrival from a number of lions and hyenas , the elephant stands ground over her mother to guard her corpse long into the night			1
@entity46 , from @entity119 , added : ' it was an emotional scene that i will quite frankly never forget			0
