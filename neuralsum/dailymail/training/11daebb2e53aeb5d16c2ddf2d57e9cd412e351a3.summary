@entity23 estimates more than 175,000 matrimonial exchanges have been postponed or foregone since the recession began , with couples putting off the white wedding until financial conditions improve			2
but the report says the ' signs are right for a temporary boost in weddings ' , according to @entity50			0
improving economic conditions and financial security are not only encouraging long - term couples to finally take the plunge , but pairs from different demographic backgrounds			1
according to the report , marriage numbers are stagnant or declining among those with a high school education or less , younger @entity2 , and the less affluent , but ' short - term increases in weddings will be concentrated ' among women aged 25 to 34 , the college - educated and the affluent			1
' declines in weddings are likely to set in towards the end of the decade , even though the number of young adults is increasing , because of the nation 's ongoing retreat from marriage , ' the report says			2

' if you 're going to get married in time to have kids , you ca n't wait forever , so they may be saying that the postponement of marriages is running its course , and a backlog of young adults is about to schedule their weddings			0
but @entity113 co-director @entity112 said the projected wedding increases ' might be overly optimistic '			0
' not all those marriages are going to be among those young people entering into their first marriages , ' she said			0
' the report is focusing on the @entity118 entering into their marrying years , which is true , but my issue is that one - third of marriages are remarriages , and the remarriages are not among the young people			0
