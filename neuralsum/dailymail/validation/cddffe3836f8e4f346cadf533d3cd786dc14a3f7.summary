@entity0 has hailed the impact of @entity3 goalkeeper @entity2 , who put a first - half error behind him to help the @entity6 to victory against @entity8			1
@entity3 went 2 - 0 up through @entity9 and @entity10 , but @entity8 pulled level after @entity2 gifted possession to @entity13 just before the half - hour mark			1
and @entity0 , speaking on @entity15 after the game , thinks that despite his error , there are few goalkeepers as good as the @entity3 man			1
@entity2 made an error in the first half to gift @entity8 their equalising goal against @entity3 @entity2 gave away possession under pressure from @entity27 to allow @entity13 to score ' he had a bit of a mix - up in the first half , ' the @entity29 pundit said			1
' he 's a world class goalkeeper to keep @entity34 out and what he did last year for @entity36 , getting to the @entity38 final			0
' he 's a fantastic keeper and he 's going to be one of the world 's best for a decade or so			0
' speaking alongside @entity0 was former @entity42 striker @entity41 , who was in agreement at @entity2 ' excellent game despite the high - profile error			1
' before the mistake , he made a couple of saves that kept @entity3 in the game , ' @entity41 noted			1
' but it 's not about the mistake , it 's about how you respond , and he responded well in the second half			2
' @entity3 's 3 - 2 win took them back to winning ways after a draw against @entity56 last time out , and restored their six - point gap ahead of @entity59 at the top of the @entity61			1
@entity0 ( left ) and @entity41 hailed @entity2 ' impact in the second half to save @entity3 @entity2 made a string of saves , including three in quick succession , to help @entity67 's side to victory their win at @entity8 was far from convincing , but according to @entity41 , getting three points in the manner @entity3 did is a mark of their winning mentality			1
' big teams will do that to you , ' he said			0
' three attempts on target , three goals			0
it sounds simple , but that 's what @entity3 are about			2
' @entity8 were unlucky in the second half on a couple of occasions , but that 's what a big team does to you			2
they come here , they do n't really perform well , they find themselves in a difficult situation , and they managed			0
' one negative for @entity67 will be the injury to @entity10 , which forced him off with 15 minutes to play holding his hamstring			0
@entity0 thinks @entity2 ( pictured ) will be one of the world 's best goalkeepers for a decade @entity0 and @entity41 also believe that @entity3 's title hopes will remain successful , even without @entity10 @entity3 's strike force is such that @entity10 's absence is unlikely to be a devastating blow , and the presence of @entity104 in the latter stages actually forced a winner for the league leaders			1
' it looks like a hamstring injury and we know his history from the @entity38 final , ' @entity0 said of @entity10			2
' if it is a hamstring injury , if @entity104 has to come in , he 's come on there [ against @entity8 ] and he 's made a difference			2
' he scored in the @entity59 game as well			0
he 's not what you 'd call top level , he has n't played that much , we know @entity67 just likes to play the same players			0
he 's not at @entity10 's level , but he 's enough to go up front and take them to the title			0
' they 've got that gap now , if they miss him for two or three games - depending on how bad the injury is - i think they 'll be fine			0

@entity3 went 2 - 0 up against @entity8 but were *pegged* back to 2 - 2
@entity8 's second goal came after a mistake by goalkeeper @entity2
@entity0 hailed @entity2 ' second - half performance , to come back from the error and help @entity3 to victory
@entity10 came off injured , but @entity0 and @entity41 believe @entity3 have enough strength in depth to win the league
