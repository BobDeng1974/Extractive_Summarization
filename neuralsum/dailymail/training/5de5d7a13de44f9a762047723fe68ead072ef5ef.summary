last night @entity2 used @entity26 to declare ‘ choc ice ’ was not a racist expression and that it simply suggested that someone was a fake			1
the controversy started when someone sent @entity2 a tweet about @entity8 ’s involvement in the @entity12 trial			1
the person wrote : ‘ looks like @entity8 ’s going to be their choc ice			1
then again he ’s always been a sell - out			0

@entity43 ! ! ’ after initial criticism by other @entity26 users , @entity2 tweeted again : ‘ if i want to laugh at something someone tweets ...			2
i will ! hahahahaha ! now stop getting ya knickers in a twist ! ’ but as the online backlash continued @entity2 tweeted to his three million followers : ‘ what i said yesterday is not a racist term			1

the 31 - year - old @entity21 captain admitted calling @entity99 a ‘ f * * * * * * black c * * * ’ and a ‘ f * * * * * * k * * * head ’ but said he was only sarcastically repeating a false allegation made by @entity99			1
giving evidence for the defence , @entity8 backed @entity12 , insisting his teammate was not a racist and saying it was wrong to prosecute him			1

@entity8 said he told @entity2 : ‘ what you ’re doing to @entity12 [ @entity12 ] is out of order ’			1
he added that he did not shake @entity2 ’s hand after the game			2

the @entity267 , who had a lawyer attending every day of the trial , said they would look at the findings of the court case before deciding whether or not to bring any proceedings against the players			0
the @entity267 will decide whether @entity12 should still be charged with using abusive and insulting words and with making reference to @entity2 ’s ethnic origin and colour			2
@entity2 could be charged with bringing the game into disrepute for the comments he made during the exchange			0
charges can still be brought by the @entity267 against @entity12 even thought he was acquitted in court because they have a lower burden of proof - @entity290 's @entity289 was banned last season for racially abusing @entity293 but that case never went to court			1
