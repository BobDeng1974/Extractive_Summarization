a four - year - old boy who has been kept in a sterile ' bubble ” ' is going to spend @entity2 day with the family he has n’t seen for four months			1
@entity4 has a rare condition which means he has no immunity to any germs			1
he has spent the past few months with his mother @entity8 as doctors at the @entity10 , in @entity11 , prepared him for a bone marrow transplant			1
@entity4 , from @entity14 , @entity15 , has not been able to see his father , @entity17 , or older brother , @entity19 , six			1
battle : @entity4 ( with his mother @entity8 ) has a rare condition which means he has no immunity to any germs			1
he has spent the last four months in a sterile ' bubble ' while doctors prepare his body for a bone marrow transplant to give him a new , healthy immune system but , if they can stay ' germ free ' , the four will be able to spend @entity2 together			1
mrs @entity31 , 34 , said : ' @entity4 has been quite poorly ever since he was about eight weeks old , but we are very hopeful the bone marrow transplant he has just had will be successful in giving him a new fully - fighting immune system			1
' she and @entity4 were allowed home to @entity15 on december 6 , but are living next door to the family home to make sure that her husband or other son have not picked up any germs before they have @entity2 together			1
@entity4 has spent much of his life in and out of hospital as doctors tried to diagnose what was wrong with him			2
mrs @entity31 said : ' @entity4 has a long medical history and had to cope with all sorts from lung disease to stomach and bowel issues			2
' at one point , his hands , knees and ankles swelled up and it turned out he had severe juvenile arthritis , which was down to his faulty immune system			2
' doctors hope the bone marrow transplant will give @entity4 a new fully - fighting immune system at the beginning of last year , @entity4 was referred to the @entity63 , in @entity11 - one of two centres in the country specialising in children with deficient immune systems			1
his mother said : ' doctors decided the best thing would be for @entity4 to have a bone marrow transplant			1
' it was a very difficult decision as there was no guarantee it would be a success			0
we were very lucky to find a perfect match through the @entity77 charity			0
' but before the transplant , @entity4 had to have very strong chemotherapy to kill off his own immune system , ready to receive a new healthy system			1
' i stayed with him in the bubble , which is a completely sterile hospital room			2
' everything has to be disinfected and you have to scrub up theatre - style before you go in the room			0
we kept in touch as a family through @entity90 but it is not the same as cuddles			0
' @entity4 can now go outside providing he wears a mask			2
his mother added : ' he is quite a cheeky chap but he is wary of adults and has n’t had much interaction with other children			0
' it has also been very hard on @entity19 since @entity4 was born			0
we have either been away in hospital or so busy nursing @entity4 at home , and then i " disappeared " in august to go to @entity11			0
' there is still a way to go and it would just be nice to have a family @entity2			0
' mrs @entity31 is now determined to raise money and awareness for the @entity109			0
she said : ' it is desperate for funds and i want to do everything i can to support this incredible charity because we owe them so much			0
it does such vital work			0
