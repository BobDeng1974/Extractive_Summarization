by @entity0 published : 19:50 est , 16 september 2013 updated : 02:07 est , 17 september 2013 she simpered , smiled , flicked her hair ; he beamed , they leaned in closer ... never mind the clothes and supermodels parading past them , @entity1 and @entity2 only had eyes for each other at the @entity10 show yesterday			1
the 19 - year - old @entity12 star flirted outrageously with actress @entity2 , 31 , as the pair sat next to each other on the front row at what has become the hottest show at @entity18			1
@entity1 was wearing a leopard print t - blouse by the label : it would have been churlish not to , given the free clobber he receives from the brand ( a fact we revealed in these pages yesterday , and which meant i was barred from seeing the show live )			2
also on the front row was @entity42 @entity41 editor @entity40 , in a powder - blue cowl neck coat and a wild expression ( she does n’t do rain ) , actress @entity46 and models @entity47 and @entity49 , wearing respectively a beanie hat and a shearling coat ; remember , these girls have no fat to keep them warm			1
@entity54 made an entrance in a bright orange skirt under a black woolly , fresh from her first @entity18 presentation for @entity59 on sunday , an event at which i was told in no uncertain terms i was not welcome			0
that 's my girl ! @entity1 only had eyes for @entity67 as she rocked the runway at the @entity10 spring / summer 2014 show in @entity71 's @entity70 on monday afternoon not now , @entity35 : despite the best efforts of @entity2 to avert his eyes from the catwalk with her flirty chat , the 19 - year - old pop heartthrob looked utterly spellbound her role as champion of this country ’s second biggest employer of women , the fashion industry , still does n’t want you , dear reader , to see exactly what she ’s been up to			1
the front row was glamorous , certainly , but a smidgen less star - studded than in recent years			1
last year the premier pew saw actress @entity90 , gold medallist @entity91 , burlesque dancer @entity92 , legendary snapper @entity93 and movie mogul @entity95 sitting side - by - side			2
supermodel strut : @entity1 looked impressed as he saw his rumoured love interest strut her stuff in front of the great and good of the fashion world there she goes : the @entity12 singer only had eyes for @entity67 , and immediately rushed backstage to be by her side as soon as the show drew to a close front row crew ! @entity1 sat alongside @entity37 , @entity2 , @entity49 , @entity111 and @entity46 ladies ' man : @entity113 , @entity35 and @entity49 were clambering over each other to talk to the pop hunk and what of the clothes ? i was amazed at the understatement : no trenches seemingly made from @entity123 wrappers , no super-chunky biker jackets made from python and fur			1
it was all rather soft and floaty and easy : @entity128 pencil skirts embellished with petals beneath a slouchy jumper			0
voluminous summer coats with bracelet sleeves in blush pink and pistachio , and lilac worn over bare skin			0
there was lots and lots of sheer , so you could see the mint knickers beneath each outfit			0
dapper dude : @entity1 looked slick in a black wool coat , skinny jeans and a printed jumper as he attended the @entity18 showcase mr popular : @entity1 enjoyed a seemingly incessant stream of female attention from his fellow celebrity attendees up close and personal : @entity2 , 31 , seemed to be paying particularly eager to chat with the teen idol as they waited for the show to start tickled pink : @entity1 appeared to be entertaining @entity2 with his no - doubt hilarious anecdotes funnyman : worlds away from her usual cool , calm and collected exterior , the actress could n't help but erupt into a fit of giggles as she chuckled away on the front row keeping up with the cool crew : @entity113 , @entity35 , @entity1 and @entity49 made for a very stylish group as they sat on the front row effortlessly chic : @entity35 rocked a teal midi - skirt and a fur coat as she posed for photographs before the @entity10 show ( so that ’s why designers use so much sheer : to stop that all - important , hugely expensive front row from dozing off )			1
there was much less of the bling that has seen the brand garner success in the @entity181 and @entity182 , but which has simultaneously made it less cool and covetable here			0
@entity67 , unable to refrain from smirking in @entity1 ’s direction , emerged near the end of a very long show seemingly enveloped in cling film , perhaps to keep her fresh given she has walked for almost every designer so far			2
oh , how the fashion crowd applauded at the end , free bags at their feet			0
expect to see the new iconic print – a splodge – on @entity196 , @entity197 in the coming days			0
you could click and buy items from the show the moment it ended , even as miss @entity40 was being rushed through the exit by black - suited bouncers ( i always wonder what she thinks a bunch of fashion editors are going to do to her )			2
until september 30 , each piece can be handmade to order , and even comes with a personalised gold nameplate			0
what ’s the betting that those celebrities who prostituted themselves in the cold @entity71 drizzle in front of paparazzi banked outside the @entity10 marquee will have personalised sets winging their way over to them already ? ever the joker ! @entity67 looked hilarious in a black balaclava as she and @entity220 left the catwalk show in the back of a car quirky : the model of the moment joked around with photographers as she continued the rounds of @entity18			1
