there are only two places on earth where tectonic plates are visible above sea level : @entity6 's @entity5 , and in the south west of @entity8			1
on @entity9 , an active lava field , just outside @entity11 , the striking @entity13 hotel stands on a craggy outcrop close to where the @entity16 and @entity17 plates meet , drifting further and further apart , each year			1
boiling water bubbles just 25ft underground here , so when it was built on the site of a geothermal power plant , its creators had to use building materials seven times stronger than standard materials used in @entity29			1
the striking @entity30 is situated on @entity9 , an active volcano whose last eruption was around 2,000 years ago the 45 - room hotel is an extension and renovation of the old workers ' quarters of the @entity39 geothermal power station , bought in 2011 , with the intention of being the only hotel in this isolated - and beautiful - part of the country			1
@entity13 makes use of @entity8 's unique geography in two ways : the biothermal energy is harnessed in a spectacular outdoor natural hot spring ; and a glass building - the @entity50 - allows guests to admire the frequent aurora borealis displays			1
owner @entity53 , who was born and raised in the region , knows all too about extreme weather , and said the @entity50 never get old			0
she says : ' this respect for @entity60 is in our blood ; our parents and grandparents certainly knew not to mess with her			0
one month before i was born , in january 1973 , there was an eruption on the @entity69 , a small island south of @entity8			2
a glass extension to the building - the @entity50 - allows guests to admire the frequent aurora borealis displays @entity13 is surrounded by natural hot springs , which provide geothermal hot water and energy to the hotel 's own natural outdoor pool rooms at the @entity13 hotel start at £ 184 ( bed and breakfast ) @entity85 offer tours green and sustainable tours of @entity8 for flights , see icelandair.co.uk ' overnight almost the entire island was covered in lava			1
the rescue to move the islanders to the mainland was successful mainly due to the fact that all of the fishing boats were in harbour as these as were too rough for the locals to fish			0
' the first boat left with habitants to reach the mainland only 30 minutes after the volcano erupted			0
even though i was born here , i ’m still fascinated about the lava , moss landscape around @entity13			0
' i still feel amazed when i see the @entity50 dancing in the sky on one of my late returns from work			0
even though you have experienced it several times before it is different when you are outside of the city , it 's much more intense			0
the @entity50 bar has floor - to - ceiling glass windows on three sides , making it the perfect vantage point for watching aurora borealis inside , there 's a modern , natural aesthetic created by @entity8 wool throws , @entity8 art , and flower vases , hand - blown by local artists ' i also thrive from the energy ; i find immense power in the @entity8 nature			2
hence the reason we chose @entity13 for the hotel 's name			0
' everything about the hotel screams @entity8			2
inside , lava , reclaimed wood and @entity8 wool are used to furnish rooms , bathroom products are made from @entity8 herbs and everything from the bed linen to the restaurant is organic and fair trade , in line with the island 's strong emphasis on preserving its natural beauty			2
to experience the tectonic plates up close , the hotel offers snorkelling and diving trips to @entity150 , the world 's most easily accessible tectonic fissure , where visibility exceeds 330ft			2
it is here that you can touch the continents of @entity158 and @entity159 at the same time			0
among the moss and lava : the @entity13 hotel is designed to make use of and complement its rugged and beautiful surroundings the restaurant - aiming to be @entity8 's first with a @entity167 star - serves up such delicacies such as reindeer , onions , spruce and bone marrow , smoked bone marrow ice cream , sea buckthorn and malt molasses and @entity8 langoustine , locally caught @entity179 char and skyr ( homemade yoghurt )			1
venturing into the wilderness , guests are offered a range of activities from horse riding in mountains around @entity188 , fly fishing on @entity190 , @entity192 glacier tours , rafting and hot spring hikes			0
as well as excursions to the @entity197 - south @entity8 's most famous sightseeing route , which includes the waterfall @entity199 and the geothermally active valley of @entity201 , containing the @entity203 geyser - which erupts every five to 10 minutes , guaranteeing an ' ooh ' or an ' ahh ' from an ever captive audience			1
the restaurant - aiming to be @entity8 's first with a @entity167 star - serves up reindeer , @entity8 langoustine and @entity179 char the underwater @entity150 fissure : guests can snorkel and scuba dive here and can touch the tectonic plates of @entity158 and @entity159 the geologically unstable rift valley of @entity11 has few houses or hotels , due to its status as a national park @entity8 's spectacular @entity199 waterfall is situated on the popular @entity197 , a route tourists can arrange to travel through the hotel			1

@entity8 's @entity225 is positioned at the foot of @entity9 on the edge of @entity11
*luxury* *accommodation* is located in an area where @entity16 and @entity17 plates drift further apart each year
@entity39 geothermal power station delivers around 1100 litres of hot water to @entity29 and *neighbouring* towns
