a millionaire @entity2 donor and prominent party supporter has been a heavy cocaine user for years , the @entity0 can reveal			1
the businessman ’s identity has been made secret by a court order despite his admission that he is addicted to the class a drug			1
he has spoken of personally meeting prime minister @entity11 but leads a double life as a seedy drug addict and regular user of prostitutes			1
the businessman ’s identity has been made secret by a court order despite his admission that he is addicted to the class a drug ( file image above ) just last month he attended the party ’s high - profile donors ’ ball , and the entrepreneur has frequently spoken out in favour of @entity27 policies			1
but despite initially keeping it a secret from even those closest to him , he has now admitted – behind closed doors – to using prodigious quantities of the dangerous stimulant and of hiring prostitutes on a weekly basis			1
his consumption of the drug is so high that people are routinely jailed for possessing the same amount he takes in a single day – because it is assumed that only a drug dealer would carry so much			1
and remarkably – despite spending hundreds of thousands of pounds on his habit in just a few years – the businessman has so far avoided any prosecution or publicity about his addiction			1
however he is not shy about appearing in the public eye			2
he always seems full of energy when caught on camera , and has been very talkative with journalists			2
he has waged a very loud publicity campaign for his business , putting many details about his life into the public domain			2
the addict has also spoken out against @entity58 policies and in favour of the conservative government – including for moves which benefited him financially			0
among the @entity2 fundraising events the man has supported is the @entity66 winter ball attended by @entity11 and @entity67 in 2007 ( above ) the donor refused to comment , however when asked about the heavy cocaine addiction , a source close to him said : ‘ there ’s a court order and it would be a contempt of court if he was identified			1
‘ he is not a well man			0
he ’s trying to sort it out and sort himself out			0
he definitely does n't want to talk about it at this stage			0
’ among the @entity2 fundraising events the man has supported is the @entity66 winter ball – a glittering occasion swarming with the super rich			1
the most recent ball – at the @entity85 on exclusive @entity86 – attracted criticism because the wealthy donors included porn barons and tax avoiders			2
tables for ten at the february event cost up to £ 15,000 each , while the minimum price for a single ticket was £ 500			0
dinner was scheduled to go on for three - and - a - half hours with speeches by mr @entity11 and the conservative chairman @entity98			0
guests could bid to go shoe shopping with home secretary @entity101 , have a cup of tea with @entity104 , go for a 10km run with @entity106 , or have a week in a luxury chalet in @entity108			0
in the final big fundraiser ahead of the general election , £ 210,000 was spent on a bronze bust of @entity112 and £ 220,000 was bid for a week - long holiday in a @entity115 fortress			0
one of the paying guests forked out £ 110,000 at the auction for a single night ’s exclusive use of @entity120 ’s nightclub			0
but a major cocaine abuser was also among them , rubbing shoulders not just with hedge fund managers and oil tycoons , but also with major party figures – including chief whip @entity127 , foreign secretary @entity128 and the education secretary @entity129			0
