by @entity0 this is the moment a stingray photobombed a family photograph at an aquarium - and it even appears to smile at the camera			1
@entity6 and @entity7 had taken their son @entity8 , 2 , for a day out at @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , to celebrate @entity6 's 30th birthday on wednesday			1
little did they know when they were taking some pictures in front of one of the tanks a cheeky @entity20 would make the most of the photo op. @entity23 and his son @entity8 were enjoying a day out at @entity11 's @entity10 when they decided to take a family photograph - will hilarious consequences			1
the stingray even appears to be smiling down the lens for his starring moment the hilarious moment took place at @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 ( pictured ) it was n't until the family got home later that day they realised one of their pictures had been hijacked			1
@entity7 , 26 , a florist , from @entity40 , said : ' it was really funny , i was n't looking through the pictures until later that day i suddenly saw it			1
' our son was enjoying the fish and we were taking pictures of everything			1
' i took three in a row and deleted one before noticing this			0
' i do n't have that much time on my hands to pretend to have taken a picture			1
. this is definitely completely genuine and perfectly timed			0
' @entity6 , 30 , an electrician , added : ' we really could n't believe it - it is hilarious			1
we had a great day and this just finished it off			0
' a diver with numerous stingrays - whose eyes are actually located on the top of their heads ( pictured ) a spokesman from the aquarium said : ' the ray in the picture is a female @entity69 which are members of the shark family			1
' we have recently had this female and another join us at @entity74 in the hope that they will breed with our two males			0
' they are very active in our tropical lagoon exhibit , their favourite food is peeler crab			0
' what looks like eyes in the photograph are actually nostrils , their eyes are actually on top of their heads			0
' a relative of the shark , @entity20 are most often found in temperate seas in shallow waters			0
they are not active animals - and spend most of their time hiding in the sand , only moving when the tide sweeps them along			2
they are sand - like in colour to match the seafloor - which helps them camouflage themselves so they are not attacked by larger predators			2
while it may look as though their faces are located on their underside , like in the picture above , that area is actually the animal 's mouth , nostrils and gill slits			2
their eyes are located on the top of their heads - peer out sidewards			2
it is because of this that scientists believe their eyes are n't used a great deal in hunting			0
instead they use electtical sensors called ampullae of @entity123 which are in their mouths			0
like a shark , stingrays use these sensors to pick up on electrical charges of potential prey .			0

the @entity7 family took a trip to @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12
they decided to take some pictures next to one of the fish tanks
one cheeky stingray photobombed their picture - smiling down the lens
