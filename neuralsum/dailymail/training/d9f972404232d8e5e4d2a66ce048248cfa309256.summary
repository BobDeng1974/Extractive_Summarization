@entity0 has fallen out with @entity2 ’s owners just three days before the start of the @entity5 season			1
the @entity7 boss , who has been in charge for only five weeks , is furious at the sale of defender @entity10 and goalkeeper @entity11 to @entity12			1
and in a move which has echoes of @entity16 ’s doomed 41 - day reign at @entity2 , he has publicly slammed the sale			1
appearances : 522 goals : 92 honours : @entity32 : 1989 , 1990 @entity0 won seven , drew nine and lost seven of his 23 games in caretaker charge of the club during the 1996/97 season			1
@entity0 confirmed the two players had been sold — for a fee believed to be around £ 5million — and then loaned back to @entity2 for the rest of this season			1
but he insisted : ‘ the players were sold without my sanction			1
i ca n’t defend the decision to sell them because it was n’t my decision			2
‘ i could sit here and lie and dress it up a little bit and cover the tracks of one or two individuals , but i ’m not prepared to do that			2
’ the club ’s @entity53 owner and chairman @entity55 has clashed with both of his previous bosses over transfer and playing policy			2
and it is clearly happening again			2
trouble ahead ? @entity10 ( left ) and @entity11 are set to sign for @entity60 @entity0 told @entity61 : ‘ last week , i was asked whether i thought the deal for them going to @entity12 was a good one , and i said , “ no , definitely not ”			1
‘ the next i heard on monday morning was the fact that the players were sold to @entity12			2
’ @entity2 legend @entity0 returned this summer as the replacement to @entity69 , who was sacked in march after falling out with @entity55			1
first choice replacement @entity70 turned down the chance to take over after meeting the @entity53 owner — even though the club were just two points off the play - offs			2
@entity70 admitted at the time : ‘ when you ’ve got experience , or you ’ve done the job , you ’ve got to do it how you want to do it and i did n’t see that happening			2
’ @entity16 had voiced the same concerns when he quit in february 2013 , and the club ’s fans will fear that a new campaign has blown up before it has even started			0
@entity2 face @entity88 at home on saturday and @entity0 is sure to want talks over his position before then			1
as if to prepare himself for the rigours of his new job — both on the pitch and in the boardroom — the 52 - year - old has completed a five - day survival course in the @entity99			0
‘ we just pitched up for five days in the wilds of @entity102 with two ex-marines , ’ he said			0
‘ it was brilliant , absolutely brilliant			0
we learnt survival skills , shelter - building , skinning hares			0
‘ to be fair the other people came from such diverse parts of the world that only two knew ( of me )			0
there was a fella from @entity114 , one from @entity115 , myself , an ex-marine from @entity117 , a policewoman from @entity119 and a @entity121 fella from the tourism industry			0
all smiles : the former @entity125 under 21 boss is hoping for @entity7 success alongside @entity127 ‘ within a day we were in a shelter we had built ourselves in a wood glade with a camp fire chopping up bits of rabbit to cook for dinner that night			1
’ but any suggestion ‘ @entity0 ’s ’ time in the wild taught him anything about himself is firmly , if politely , dismissed			1
‘ you ’re permanently hungry on a survival course and you prioritise keeping warm and eating			0
that ’s it , ’ he shrugs			2
@entity0 ’s first task on returning to the @entity7 was to tell his players and staff to forget the expectation that comes with being double @entity148 champions			1
‘ i hate the “ sleeping giant ” tag , ’ he snaps			1
‘ i addressed all the players and staff in may and told them to forget that			0
why do @entity2 have any more right to promotion than another club ? ‘ the part of my life as a player at this club was fantastic , but when the first ball ’s kicked on the first day of the season , that finishes			1
‘ i ’m not naive			0
but i hope that when we do part company , the club are back in the @entity166			0
’ experience : @entity0 says he enjoyed coaching the @entity168 ( @entity169 and @entity170 pictured ) the wearied look that marked the end of @entity0 ’s @entity125 21 coaching tenure has gone			1
yet he laughs at the suggestion he might have pined for the intensity of club management after leaving the @entity178 job in 2007			0
@entity0 admits , however , that @entity2 was one of the few roles that would have enticed him back to domestic football			1
‘ i did n’t miss it , ’ he says			0
‘ i loved international football			0
you end up winning the majority of your games while you enjoy @entity187 instead of fire - fighting week - in , week - out and you ’re working with the best players in @entity125			0
‘ i ’ve been managing and coaching for 12 years			0
it meant a lot to represent the @entity193 and i thought : “ how am i going to replicate that feeling i had representing @entity125 ? ” ‘ @entity2 was one of the clubs i felt would stoke me up again			1
i ’d rather go to work having that feeling about myself than do it just to get paid			0
’ @entity12 have greater attacking threat - @entity198			0

@entity0 says the pair were sold against his wishes
the boss also shrugs off @entity2 *'s* ' sleeping giant ' tag
*ex-england* under 21 manager took over at the @entity7 this summer
@entity2 start their season against *beleaguered* @entity88
