by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 07:50 est , 10 september 2013 updated : 19:48 est , 10 september 2013 @entity2 was met with stony silence by union leaders yesterday , even after dropping plans to dilute their infamous block vote within the @entity7			1
most of his attempt to repair his battered relationship with union barons was met with silence or unenthusiastic applause			2
and the biggest cheer of the day came from the head of the @entity16 , who demanded to know whether he backed the coalition 's austerity programme			1
scroll down to watch ... pressure : labour leader @entity2 told the @entity21 in @entity22 that unions had an important part to play in his party grilling : mr @entity2 took questions , with @entity21 general secretary @entity27 looking on the @entity7 leader , who owes his job to union voting power , used his speech to argue they are not ‘ the enemy within ’ and lauded their 6.5million members as ‘ the people who make @entity37 what it is ’			1
but he acknowledged that his party reforms could mean as few as one in ten union members who currently contribute to @entity7 coffers will do so in future			1
the changes will ensure members have to specifically opt in for their fees to go to the party			1
@entity49 leaders lambasted the plans at the weekend , saying mr @entity2 was a ‘ schoolboy ’ who lives in ‘ cloud cuckoo land ’			1
addressing the @entity21 conference in @entity22 today , mr @entity2 launched a trenchant defence of trade unionism , rejecting @entity57 ’s famous description of parts of the movement as enemies			1
silence : large parts of mr @entity2 ; s speech were greeted with silence or unenthusiastic applause but taking questions he faced hostility from public sector workers unhappy at spending cuts designed to cut the nation 's debts			1
@entity72 , president of the @entity16 which has staged several strikes opposing austerity , used a question and answer session to tackle the @entity7 leader			1
she told mr @entity2 : ' @entity77 says this is the wrong sort of recovery , yet you 're committed to the @entity82 ' spending plans			1
you say the next election will be about living standards ; but you 're committed to the public sector pay cap			0
' your policies seem contradictory and they 're confusing people			0
can we get a clear answer : are you for or against austerity ? ' after appearing taken aback , the @entity7 leader said : ' we are not in favour of austerity			1
' but he then risked angering the unions by admitting that @entity7 would stick to @entity95 spending limits in order to appear ' credible '			2
speaking afterwards ms @entity72 said : ' austerity is n't working , our members know that and people up and down the country know it			1
' it is incredibly disappointing that , in front of an audience of delegates representing more than six million workers , @entity2 failed to offer the alternative people so desperately want and need			1
' in his speech mr @entity2 accused @entity111 of devaluing millions of ordinary workers through his attacks on the unions			1
‘ we have a prime minister who writes you and your members off , ’ he said			2
‘ who does n’t just write you off , but oozes contempt for you from every pore			0
what does he say about you ? he says your members are a threat to our economy			2
back to the enemy within			0
‘ six and a half million people in @entity37			0
who teach our children , who look after the sick , who care for the elderly , who build our homes , who keep our shops open morning , noon and night			0
they ’re not the enemy within			0
they ’re the people who make @entity37 what it is			0
finishing touches : mr @entity2 drafted his speech on the train to @entity22 ‘ how dare he ? how dare he insult people , members of trade unions , as he does ? how dare he write off whole sections of our society ? ‘ one nation conservatives , would be turning in their graves if they could hear the nasty , divisive , small - minded rhetoric of the leader of their once great party			1
' we know from recent experience what happens to political leaders who write off whole sections of a country			0
‘ that ’s what @entity154 did when he talked about the 47 per cent of people who would never vote for him			0
and look what happened to him			0
’ under the current system , union members automatically pay an annual fee of £ 3 to the @entity7 unless they specifically opt out – swelling party funds by millions of pounds a year			1
mr @entity2 has unveiled plans to force trade unionists to actively opt in to the funding of @entity7 , with the reward that they will become full party members			1
he told delegates he believes his changes could see his party ’s membership increase by 300,000 – a figure critics say will make him a hostage to fortune if it does not come about			2
but the target number is far fewer than the three million union members who currently contribute to @entity7 coffers because they have not opted out			1
@entity7 is likely to head off the threat of a huge loss of funds by charging those who opt in more than the current £ 3 a year			2
critics say the reforms could actually strengthen the unions , because it could see them hanging on to more money designed for political campaigning			2
mr @entity2 said : ‘ it will be a massive challenge for the @entity7 to reach out to your members in a way that we have not done for many years and persuade them to be part of what we do			1
‘ and , like anything that is hard , it is a risk			0
but the bigger risk is just saying let ’s do it as we have always done it			0
’ @entity202 , who is @entity7 ’s business spokesman , said it was important to ‘ take the big money out of politics ’ even if it hit the party ’s finances			2
but backbencher @entity208 said @entity7 faced ruin and meltdown as a result of the ‘ ill thought through ’ reforms			2
yesterday @entity214 , general secretary of the powerful @entity216 union , called on mr @entity2 to be even stronger in his defence of union links			1
‘ trade unions have always been a force for good in our society , ’ he told a fringe event at the conference			2
instead of attacking , people should look to try and unite the nation			0
’ @entity227 celebrating the death in april of @entity57 are on sale at the @entity21 conference			1
bearing the legend ‘ @entity234 ’ , they are available alongside t - shirts and mugs with the slogan ‘ @entity82 are lower than @entity237 ’			0
conservative politicians said the merchandise highlighted the nasty side of the @entity241			0
@entity242 , mp for @entity243 , said : ‘ she said they could n’t forgive her because she won and they lost			0
’ unions and left - wing campaign groups are planning a national day of strikes and civil disobedience on @entity252 as part of their campaign against the government ’s austerity programme			1
yesterday @entity21 delegates approved the call for unions to co-ordinate a programme of strikes			1
the union - backed @entity262 had already organised a protest , which was planned to take place on november 5			2
however this is now set to be directly supported by the unions themselves			0
key workers – from nurses to firemen , teachers to postmen – could cause chaos if they decide to join the walkout			0
the plan raises the possibility of firemen and nurses striking on @entity252 night , a move which could force people to cancel parties due to health and safety fears			0
unions are legally allowed to ‘ co-ordinate ’ their strike action , or organise walkouts on the same day , as long as they have each successfully balloted their workforce on separate trade disputes			0
this is not the same as organising ‘ sympathy strikes ’ where workers walk out in support of other striking workers without having held a legal ballot			2
these were outlawed during the 1980s			0
yesterday @entity216 ’s executive director of policy @entity298 said he believes the ‘ yes ’ vote has committed the union to a policy of ‘ fighting back , industrially where possible ’			0
he added : ‘ but more than that , it commits us to organise a mass mobilisation			0
