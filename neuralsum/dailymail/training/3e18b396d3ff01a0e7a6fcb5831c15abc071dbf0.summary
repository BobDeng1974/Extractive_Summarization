by @entity0 published : 12:16 est , 7 july 2013 updated : 08:02 est , 8 july 2013 an official study published in 2009 revealed that two thirds of all fresh chicken on shelves is contaminated with the potentially lethal food poisoning bug food poisoning cases linked to infected chicken are rising despite demands that supermarkets and farmers stop putting customers at risk			1
an estimated 580,000 people each year are falling ill with stomach upsets caused by campylobacter , the @entity17 ’s most common cause of food poisoning			1
as many as 18,000 are so ill that they need hospital care while about 140 people die each year from the bug			1
new figures published by the @entity24 reveal the number of cases has been rising every year for the past four years , despite the watchdog making tackling food poisoning its number one priority			1
trials on farms to increase security and limit any chances of the spread of the bug have failed to bring down the number of birds carrying the infection			1
at the same time , a number of warnings to supermarkets to make sure the birds on their shelves are clean appear to have failed to protect public health			1
a 2009 study revealed that two thirds of all fresh chicken on shelves is contaminated with the potentially lethal food poisoning bug			0
the latest evidence about the number of cases in humans suggests this situation has not improved			0
a draft copy of the annual report by the @entity24 's chief scientist , dr @entity57 , reveals the officially recorded number of campylobacter cases in humans last year was 72,571 , an increase of 0.4 per cent from 2011			1
it is thought the actual number of cases is eight times higher , taking the total to 580,568 , because the vast majority of sufferers do not go to their gps			0
the @entity24 and its advisers hoped that putting in place improved hygiene controls and biosecurity measures on chicken farms would reduce the number of infected birds			1
its strategy , which was designed to reduce the number of contaminated chicken on farms by 50 per cent by 2010 , has been a hopeless failure			2
in his report , dr @entity57 says : ‘ early indications from these projects suggest that compliance with these biosecurity interventions , as determined at a periodic audit , has not yet resulted in the campylobacter reductions that were predicted			0
’ successive chief executives at the @entity24 have lambasted supermarkets for not doing enough to cut campylobacter contamination in the chicken they sell			1
its then chief executive , @entity94 , wrote to the chief executives of all the supermarkets in 2010 demanding action			2
this failed to bring about the desired result and mr @entity94 is now the group technical director at @entity101			0
following a failure to improve the situation , his successor , @entity102 , issued a new call for action in january this year , saying tackling campylobacter in chicken was her top priority			1
crackdown : the @entity24 has asked supermarkets to tackle the bacteria problem ( file photo ) miss @entity102 called supermarket bosses to a meeting to discuss how to tackle the problem while she has hinted that stores may be required to remove chicken from sale unless they can guarantee the bug has been removed			1
she said it ‘ unacceptable ’ that two - thirds of chicken carry the disease , while a fifth are ‘ highly contaminated ’ at the time of purchase			0
however , yet again there is no evidence of any major drive by the supermarkets to protect customers , beyond introducing non-drip packaging			2
the government watchdog is now considering drastic measures to clean up chicken and protect consumers			0
these include killing the bugs by either washing the meat with lactic acid or the use of blast freezing			0
a survey by which ? found 60 per cent of shoppers would be ‘ unlikely ’ to buy chicken that had been sprayed or washed with a mild acid			0
the @entity24 research said consumers would rather that the food industry provides clean and safe food , rather than treating it to disinfect it			1
its study found more people would prefer to buy a chicken that had not been treated with lactic acid than one that had – 44 per cent versus 38 per cent			2
dr @entity57 ’s report estimates that there are around one million cases of food poisoning from all sources each year , resulting in 20,000 hospital admissions and contributing to around 500 deaths			2
the cost to the @entity17 economy in terms of treatment and lost days of work is put at £ 1.8billion a year			2
norovirus , which has been linked to oysters , salmonella , listeria and e.coli are the other major causes of illness			0
the number of officially recorded cases of listeria , which is particularly linked to soft unpasteurised cheese , rose from 164 in 2011 to 184 in 2012			0
the disease is relatively rare but poses a particular risk to pregnant women , unborn babies and the elderly			0
as many as one third of sufferers admitted to hospital die from complications .			0

an estimated nearly *600,000* people each year fall ill because of bacteria
the @entity24 has demanded supermarkets and farms improve standards
