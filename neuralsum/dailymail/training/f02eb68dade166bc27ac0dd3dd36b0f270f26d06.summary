by @entity0 published : 10:07 est , 31 july 2012 updated : 10:14 est , 31 july 2012 super-snitches have pocketed more than £ 1 million for helping catch tax - dodgers since the banking crisis began in 2008 , it was revealed today			1
huge taxpayer - funded ' bounty payments ' of up to £ 100,000 have been handed out by @entity6 to try to clamp down on evasion			1
cash rewards given to members of the public rose by more than a fifth in the last year , probably because more people were trying to avoid the 50p rate of income tax , experts say			0
and the government says that disgruntled spouses , family members , neighbours or colleagues are among the people who successfully snitched			1
tax credit : members of the public who successfully shopped people dodging tax have received huge sums of money in the last 5 years in 2008 @entity6 even paid £ 100,000 to an individual who provided details of secret bank accounts held by wealthy @entity30 in @entity31			1
a total of £ 374,000 was paid - out by @entity6 in 2011 - 12 , figures released under the @entity33 show			1
this with compares with £ 309,620 in 2010 - 11 , £ 384,110 in 2009 - 10 , £ 281,000 in 2008 - 09 , and £ 155,950 in 2007 - 08			0
@entity36 , tax partner at @entity38 , the accountancy giant , suggested that the increase in the top rate of income tax to 50 per cent in 2010 could be a factor in the rising payouts			0
' when tax rates go up , there is more evasion , ' he said			0
' i would not like to see this turned into a career			0
' figures published by investigative website @entity52 revealed how individuals have been handed the cash for information that leads to the recovery of unpaid tax			2
curtain - twitchers : 70,000 people called the tax evasion hotline last year - although not all received payment			2
@entity6 claims that most payments are for low amounts - £ 50 or £ 60 - and are paid out following calls to its tax evasion hotline			1
but information that leads to higher sums of unpaid tax being recovered can trigger payments running to some much larger amounts			1
' it can range from someone who has heard someone bragging in the pub about work they have done cash - in - hand , to details of someone shipping in lorry loads of vodka with paying tax ' , an @entity6 spokesman said			2
the payments are based on the amount of unpaid tax that is recovered but there is no formula or fixed percentage basis for the rewards			1
@entity6 said that 70,000 people called their tax evasion hotline last year , but that only a small proportion of these would have received payments			2
the handouts are at the discretion of officers and are only paid once unpaid tax has actually been recovered			1
a spokesman said : ' the system works in the same way as @entity96 - sometimes there will be cash rewards to help persuade the public to come forward			0
officers review all calls and must decide which ones to open investigations into , watching out for malicious and incorrect information			0
' @entity6 says the payments to informants represents good value for money in the fight against illegal tax evasion			2
there are no up - to - date figures for the level of tax recovered as a result of information from paid informants , but figures for the period between 2005 and 2009 showed £ 42million was clawed back by the taxman this way			1
this week pupils were being encouraged to shop tax dodgers to their teachers			0
tax officers have developed teaching modules for schools in which youngsters are asked if they know anyone ‘ in their local area ’ who is not paying their fair share			0
@entity6 said it did not use the scheme to collect information about tax evaders from children			0
but critics said it was ‘ un-british ’ of the taxman to try to turn ‘ children into state spies ’ .			0

one person was paid £ 100,000 for helping stop an *offshore* tax - dodge
upset spouses , neighbours or colleagues are *typical* snitches
people are not paid their *fee* until the unpaid tax is recovered , @entity6 say
