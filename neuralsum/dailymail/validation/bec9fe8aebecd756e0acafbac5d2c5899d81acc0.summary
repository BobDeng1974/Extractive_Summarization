@entity8 hit the woodwork either side of a seventh - minute goal which edged him closer to sir @entity14 's all - time record of 49			1
a deflected @entity16 effort and @entity18 's first @entity2 goal added extra gloss on a night which @entity0 will take the headlines			1

@entity39 5.5 started well , was really good at joining attacks – but @entity25 attacks , such as they were , came down the left side			0
@entity44 6 did everything asked of him			0
dealt with the very occasional dangers well			0
tuesday night against @entity47 will tell us more @entity16 ( floor centre ) claimed the second goal with a deflected header @entity52 6 hard to assess on a night of limited action – strong and resolute as expected , distribution satisfactory			2
now first choice – if he seizes opportunity could be so for a decade			0
@entity58 5.5 not sorely tested but not his best night ; occasional lapses and poor cross / shot when he had a goal - scoring opportunity @entity64 7.5 a steadying influence and creative fulcrum at the base of the midfield – stay fit and he might turn into @entity2 ’s key midfielder over the next 15 months			2
@entity2 forward @entity16 was a constant worry for the @entity71 back four in @entity7 qualifier @entity73 7 seemed to enjoyed the more advanced role ; his busyness paid off with his excellent drilled cross to create @entity2 ’s second @entity8 8 clearly intent on making this his night			1

occasional lapses in distribution but great lofted ball for @entity8 ’s early shot against post subs @entity0 8 what an extraordinary season			2

system gave @entity2 width and pace and @entity16 was on fire			2
a good night for the @entity2 manager @entity2 manager @entity4 enjoyed a good night at @entity125 referee @entity127 ( @entity128 ) 6 generally solid but the missed @entity16 penalty was his one blind spot on a quiet night			0
