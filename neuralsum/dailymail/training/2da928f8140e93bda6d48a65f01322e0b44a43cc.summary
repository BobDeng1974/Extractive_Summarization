@entity0 wants @entity1 to kick on from recent domestic successes and book a place in this season 's @entity5 quarter - finals			1
victory over @entity10 visitors @entity8 on saturday would secure a last - eight spot one game inside the distance			1

@entity0 is hoping some good domestic results can buoy @entity1 into the @entity20 quarter - finals " we have been given a huge confidence boost , " @entity23 international hook said			0
" we beat a good side in @entity14 , and we beat a champion side in @entity15			2
" we have to build from those results			0
the atmosphere was brilliant against @entity15 - i have never known an atmosphere like it at @entity10 - and we now move back to @entity34 competition			0
" we have to try and get a home quarter - final , and we know @entity8 are a tough team , but we need to go again			0
" @entity1 rugby director @entity38 ' team selection reflects the importance of saturday 's @entity41 game , with @entity0 - who moves from fly - half to full - back - being joined by fellow internationals like @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 , while @entity49 replaces injured @entity52 number eight @entity50			0
@entity52 international @entity53 ( left ) will be in the @entity1 team to face @entity8 on saturday @entity38 said : " the two recent wins have given some real self - belief to the squad , and @entity34 has brought the best out of the team so far this season			1
" for us now , it 's about making sure we are as well prepared for @entity8 as we were for @entity15 last week			2
" training has gone well , and we 're looking forward to hopefully getting the win which would ensure that we win the pool			0
" @entity65 , now under the guidance of interim head coach @entity67 following rugby director @entity69 's departure earlier this week , will keep the heat on @entity72 rivals @entity71 if they beat @entity74 visitors @entity75 on saturday			1
@entity65 show two changes from the side that beat @entity14 five days ago , with @entity78 starting in the second - row and centre @entity79 replacing @entity81			1
@entity65 will make a change as @entity79 comes in for @entity81 , @entity78 also starts in @entity84 , @entity83 will overtake saturday 's @entity86 visitors @entity85 as group leaders with victory on @entity89 , but the @entity91 side are likely to provide testing opposition			0
" i made it to the semi-final of the @entity96 as a player with @entity1 and the quarter - finals with @entity99 , and the pool stages were the hardest parts , " @entity85 head coach @entity93 said			2
" i have been to @entity83 many times as a player and a coach , and it 's a tough place to go , but i am sure we will rise to the challenge			0
" @entity108 , meanwhile , will remain top of @entity110 if they defeat @entity112 on saturday , with sunday 's action taking @entity115 leaders @entity14 to @entity116 for a clash against their closest group rivals @entity119			1
@entity50 will miss the game for @entity1 after being stretchered off during the game with @entity15			2
