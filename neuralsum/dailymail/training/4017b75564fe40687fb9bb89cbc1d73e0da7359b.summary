by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor a rise in interest rates would make 800,000 families ‘ mortgage prisoners ’ unable to get a new loan on their home , a new report warns today			1
the number of households spending more than half of their income paying off debts repayments could also increase from 0.6 million to 1.1 million if rates start to rise , the @entity9 said			1
it comes as after @entity19 governor @entity18 warned household debt is a ‘ major risk ’ to the economy and could tip @entity21 back into recession when interest rates rise			1
around 800,000 families could find themselves trapped on poor tracker deals , unable to refinance their mortgage because rate rises have pushed up bills , the @entity9 warned the @entity19 ’s base rate is expected to rise from historic low of just 0.5 per cent within the next year , possibly before the end of 2014			1
in a speech yesterday mr @entity18 said : ‘ the @entity21 economy is starting to head back to normal			1
as the economy normalises , @entity36 will need to start to rise			1
’ but millions of families who took out loans when rates were low could find themselves struggling to make repayments			2
the @entity9 said people needed to start planning for the base rate to climb to 3 per cent by 2018 , in line with market expectations			1
if this happens , the number of ' highly geared ' mortgage holders who are spending more than one third of their income on repayments could balloon from 1.1 million currently to 2.3 million by 2018 , equating to around one in four households with a mortgage			1
@entity19 governor @entity18 said if rates rise too soon , families will cut back on other spending , plunging the economy back into recession the @entity9 gave indications of how changes in mortgage rates could impact on repayments			1
a rate of 3.2 per cent , which corresponds with current average mortgage rates , means someone with a 25 - year mortgage of £ 150,000 pays £ 727 a month			2
but if this rate increases to 3.7 per cent , the monthly cost is £ 767 , amounting to around £ 480 a year more			0
if the rate jumps another percentage point , to 4.7 per cent , the monthly cost is £ 851 and the mortgage holder pays in the region of £ 1,488 more a year than they would on a rate of 3.2 per cent			0
moving the mortgage rate up to 5.7 per cent means the mortgage holder pays £ 939 a month , or around £ 2,544 a year more than on a rate of 3.2 per cent			0
the report also estimates that around 800,000 ' highly geared ' borrowers may become mortgage prisoners as interest rates rise			1
they will struggle to refinance because they do not comply with tougher rules on applying for mortgages introduced in the wake of the financial crash			0
it means they will have no choice but to stay on their existing lender 's standard variable rate ( @entity93 ) , and their monthly bills will rise with every increase in the base rate			2
@entity97 , chief economist at the @entity9 and co-author of the @entity100 report , said : ' it would be a serious mistake to think that the legacy of problem debt built up in the pre-crisis years will simply evaporate with a return to economic growth			2
' the magnitude of the stock of debt is simply too large , given expectations that income growth will be gradual at best			0
' and while the mortgage market largely remains competitive , tighter lending criteria means that some highly - stretched borrowers face limited choices			0
there is a pressing need for regulation to respond to this new context			0
' the think tank warns country needs ' shaking from its complacency ' and lenders should be upping efforts to identify and help people who would be put at risk by a rise in interest rates , including those not yet in arrears			1
they should be encouraged to undertake a ' financial mot ' and consider how their repayments would go up in the light of different plausible interest rate increases , the report said			0
this initiative would be similar to that involving home owners on interest - only mortgages who have been contacted by lenders amid fears that many do not have enough money put aside to pay back their loan when it ends			0
mr @entity18 yesterday repeated his message that the central bank plans that any rises in interest rates will be ‘ gradual and limited ’ to cushion the blow for highly - indebted borrowers			2
but he warned that if rates rise more quickly than expected it could ‘ tip the economy into recession ’ because people cut back spending elsewhere to pay their mortgages			1
‘ it is the prospects for household indebtedness that concern us , ’ said mr @entity18			0
‘ history shows that the @entity21 people do everything they can to pay their mortgages			0
that means cutting back deeply on expenditures when the unexpected happens			0
‘ if a lot of people are highly indebted , that could tip the economy into recession			2
since we start from a vulnerable position we need to be especially careful			0
