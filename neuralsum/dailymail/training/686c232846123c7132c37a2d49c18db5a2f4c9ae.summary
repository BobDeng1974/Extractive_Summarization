his comments , which will add to growing fears over secret arrests , provoked outrage among child abuse campaigners			1
mr @entity17 also said he wanted his staff to be known as crime fighters , not police officers , adding : ‘ we are not the police , we are a different type of agency			0
we have the powers of constables but we are different			0
we are pleased to be described as crime fighters			0
