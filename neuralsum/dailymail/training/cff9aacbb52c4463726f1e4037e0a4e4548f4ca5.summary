it was a mission that captivated audiences across the world - and now images have revealed the dramatic moment @entity5 was safely recovered into the huge well deck of the @entity7			1
a combined @entity9 and @entity10 team successfully towed the spacecraft out of the water after a flawless launch and landing			1
and @entity5 - which will one day take astronauts to an asteroid and ultimately @entity17 - will be brought triumphantly back to shore later today			1
this was the first at - sea testing of the @entity23 using a @entity9 well deck recovery method			2
@entity5 will make its return to shore later today ‘ this mission exemplifies the @entity9 commitment to the research and development of technologies and techniques to ensure the safety of human space flight support , ’ said @entity27 , captain @entity28			1
‘ i could not be more proud of my crew			0
’ the successful retrieval of @entity39 1 ( @entity39 - 1 ) was part of a @entity42 government inter-agency effort to test recovery techniques for future space flights			0
but although this was @entity5 ’s first trip to space , it is actually the fifth at - sea testing of a module using the @entity9 well deck recovery method - although the others had used mock - ups			1
four tests were conducted prior to the flight to prepare the recovery team and make sure everything went smoothly			0
the first test was conducted at @entity59 , @entity60 in august 2013			0
the others were conducted earlier in 2014 , known as @entity62 ( @entity63 )			0
@entity10 's @entity5 spacecraft is off loaded from the back of the @entity7 at @entity66 , @entity67 @entity9 personnel work as @entity10 's @entity5 space capsule is prepared to be unloaded from the @entity7 at @entity70 sailors from the amphibious transport dock , @entity7 , and @entity73 , assigned to the @entity74 11 ( @entity75 ) , @entity76 and @entity77 11 - 7 , attach a line to the @entity23 navy divers are seen here attaching a towing bridle to the @entity23			1
the successful retrieval of @entity39 1 ( @entity39 - 1 ) was part of a @entity42 government interagency effort to test recovery techniques for future flights here the air bags are seen inflated , which were used to keep the capsule in an upright position - known as @entity89 1 divers surround the capsule ( in green helmets ) as the operation begins to recover @entity5 the @entity7 was ultimately chosen for @entity39 - 1 as it has a combination of capabilities suited to assist @entity10 with the @entity5 recovery			1
called a landing platform dock ( @entity99 ) ship , it has a well - deck , advanced medical facilities , helicopters , three dimensional air - search radar and small boats that could all be used in the recovery operation			2
a specially - trained bridge team were also used throughout the duration of the recovery			0
and once the capsule had landed in the @entity109 , off the coast of @entity67 , the ship manoeuvred close to it along with small boats in order to safely retrieve it			2
navy divers guide the @entity23 alongside the amphibious transport dock @entity7 during the @entity39 - 1 recovery recovery team members in a @entity119 boat help guide @entity10 's @entity5 spacecraft into the well deck of the @entity7 following its splashdown in the @entity109 here the @entity5 spacecraft is seen after it had been pulled safely into the well deck of the @entity9 ’s @entity7			1
it 's now being transported back to shore on board the @entity7 , and is expected to be off loaded at @entity70 later today divers attached lines from the small boats to guide the capsule toward @entity7 , where a @entity10 - designed winch hauled the capsule into the well deck			1
‘ @entity5 is meant to be reused , which is why we tailored this recovery to accommodate keeping the capsule safe , ’ said @entity133 of @entity74 11			0
and chief boatswain ’s mate @entity137 , deck department leading chief petty officer , added : ' we practiced this recovery many times with safety as the number one priority			0
the sailors were focused and completed the mission at hand successfully			0
' i could n't be more proud of our sailors and the work they accomplished here today			0

cameras fitted to the rocket and capsule captured the entire mission - giving an unprecedented ' @entity5 's - eye ' view from inside the capsule that could on day take man to @entity17			1
looking home : cameras onboard the @entity5 capsule took this stunning snap of the @entity176 during re-entry			0
flames show the incredible heat the capsule was subjected to , as it hit speeds of 20,000 mph and weathered temperatures approaching @entity156 ( 4,000 ° f ) cameras onboard @entity5 captured its entire mission , from blast off ( left ) to its climb into orbit ( right ) an astronaut 's eye view : a camera mounted insde the capsule looking out a windows captured this stunning image of @entity176 during the uncrewed test , @entity5 traveled twice through the @entity213 belt , where it experienced periods of intense radiation , and reached an altitude of 3,600 miles above @entity176			1
the spacecraft hit speeds of 20,000 mph ( 32,000 kph ) and weathered temperatures approaching 4,000 degrees fahrenheit as it entered @entity176 's atmosphere			1
if astronauts had been onboard @entity5 , they would have experienced a g - force of 8.2 - nearly twice that generated when @entity224 capsules return from the @entity225			2
@entity5 hit its target point 275 miles ( 442 km ) west of @entity67 , @entity67 , and achieved at least one record : flying farther and faster than any capsule built for humans since the @entity230			1
' there 's your new spacecraft , @entity236 , ' @entity232 commentator @entity231 said as the @entity5 capsule neared the water			2
he called the journey ' the most perfect flight you could ever imagine			0
' the capsule reached a peak altitude more than 14 times farther from @entity176 than the @entity225			0
no spacecraft designed for astronauts had gone so far since @entity246 , 42 years ago			2
@entity10 needed to send @entity5 that high in order to set the crew module up for a rapid and fiery entry			2
that was considered the most critical part of the entire flight - testing the largest of its kind heat shield for survival before humans climb aboard			0
in 11 minutes , @entity5 slowed from to 20 mph ( 32km/h ) at splashdown - its final descent aided by eight parachutes deployed in sequence			2
@entity176 shrank from view through @entity5 's capsule window during its trip out to space , and stunning images were relayed back home			2
its return was recorded by an unmanned drone flying over the recovery zone , providing more spectacular views			0
helicopters then relayed images of the crew module bobbing in the water			0
three of the five air bags deployed properly , enough to keep the capsule floating upright			0
' today 's flight test of @entity5 is a huge step for @entity10 and a really critical part of our work to pioneer deep space on our journey to @entity17 , ' said @entity10 administrator @entity162 on friday			1
' the teams did a tremendous job putting @entity5 through its paces in the real environment it will endure as we push the boundary of human exploration in the coming years			0
' after being offloaded at shore the capsule will make the journey back to @entity293 from @entity70 on the back of a truck - and officials said they hoped it would arrive by @entity298			1
@entity5 is being developed alongside the world 's most powerful rocket , the @entity301 ( @entity301 ) , which is due to make its maiden launch in 2018 or 2019			0
together , @entity301 and @entity5 will allow @entity10 to send humans into deep space to destinations such as @entity17			1
there were a number of key moments throughout the flight ( shown in diagram ) , designed to test the capability of @entity5 , all of which it passed without a hitch			0
in total the flight lasted about four and a half hours first step towards @entity17 : @entity5 's @entity319 rocket clears the service tower that sits alongside the launchpad at @entity169			2
the high - stakes test flight is meant to usher in a new era of human exploration leading ultimately to @entity17 test flight : @entity5 made two big laps around @entity176 before re-entering the atmosphere at 20,000 mph ( 32,200 km / h )			1
pictured is an artist 's impression of the @entity5 craft with its dummy service module in orbit ambition : the earliest @entity5 might carry passengers is 2021 ; a mission to an asteroid is on the space agency 's radar sometime in the 2020s and @entity17 , the grand prize , in the 2030s			1

a series of images have revealed how a combined @entity9 and @entity10 team recovered the @entity5 spacecraft
the future @entity17 - bound *vehicle* splashed down at a target point 275 miles ( 442km ) west of @entity67
divers and a fleet of boats were used to tow @entity5 back to the well deck of the @entity7
the ship is now making its way to shore and will offload @entity5 in @entity70 later today
@entity5 launched at *12.05* *gmt* ( *07.05* et ) on 5 dec , making a 4.5 hour - journey that saw it orbit earth twice
it then re-entered the atmosphere at 20,000 mph ( 32,000 kph ) enduring temperatures of @entity156 ( 4,000 ° f )
@entity10 's @entity5 spacecraft is designed to carry astronauts to an asteroid and eventually to @entity17 in the 2030s
