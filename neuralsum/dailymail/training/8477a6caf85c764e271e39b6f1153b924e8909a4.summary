by @entity0 published : 13:07 est , 1 july 2012 updated : 01:53 est , 2 july 2012 @entity1 of @entity2 has been portrayed as a gold - digger in a promotional video made by @entity6 tourism executives			1
in the bizarre advertisement - which was made by @entity11 city officials publicising a range of ' panda cabs ' - lookalikes playing @entity15 , prince @entity7 and the @entity8 are seen standing outside a palace trying to hail a taxi			1
the ' queen ' is shown shouting ' taxi ' - and whistling to get a driver 's attention - before telling her ' grandson ' and his wife they should save money by opting for a cab to get to the jubilee celebrations			2

the commoners want to see us tightening our belts and all that			0
' ' @entity15 ' then retorts : ' rubbish , people want to see that they can be like us if they just work hard '			2
her comments then prompt a cutting response from the ' queen ' - played by @entity58 - who quips : ' like you did ? ' scathing : @entity15 's lack of career is mocked in the promotional video keeping the peace : ' @entity7 ' is seen defending his wife when she is mocked by the queen cutting : when ' @entity15 ' talks about people working hard to achieve success , the @entity8 quips : ' like you did ? ' leaping to his ' wife 's ' defence , @entity7 says : ' now , now granny , we all know that it was i who fell for @entity15			1
' @entity1 then replies : ' that ’s right , i did n’t even fancy him at first			2
do n’t you remember ? you had to practically beg me for my phone number			0
' the advert appears to poke fun at the fact that @entity15 did not have a full - time job while she and @entity7 were dating , something she attracted criticism for			1
she worked at the high street retailing chain @entity87 for less than a year before leaving to join her family 's mail order business , @entity90 , on just three days a week			0
the bizarre video ends with the trio arriving at a @entity93 in a black taxi ' panda cab ' and posing for pictures with ' commoners ' quite what relevance @entity99 's @entity98 has to boosting tourism in the @entity6 city of @entity11 is anyone 's guess			1
@entity107 in @entity108 , in south east @entity106 , the two - minute advertisement was made for the @entity109 with @entity110 and promotes a fleet of 50 ' panda cabs ' , which are @entity106 black - taxis with pictures of the bears painted on to them			0
the association hopes the panda cabs will help boost tourism in @entity11 , an area which attracts almost 100,000 visitors each year to its world - renowned breeding and research base for giant pandas			0
the advert , which is running on social networking sites , was described as a bit of ' harmless fun ' by a spokesman for the @entity109 , the @entity125 reported			0
controversial : the video , promoting a range of ' panda cabs ' in @entity106 shows @entity134 ( pictured ) hailing a taxi with the queen the real deal : @entity8 , prince @entity7 and the @entity15 standing together on the balcony of @entity139 for the jubilee celebrations however , it attracted swift online criticism from @entity99 who saw it			1
