pure ? @entity2 's poor environmental record has cast doubt on its claims to be ' 100 % @entity0 ' for a country that markets itself to the world with the slogan ' 100 % @entity0 ' , @entity2 's environmental credentials are not as impeccable as many would think			1
the majority of its rivers are too polluted to swim in			0
its record on preservation of natural environments is among the worst in the world on a per capita basis			0
and it is the only @entity19 country that does not produce a regular national report on its environment			0
the discovery by dairy giant @entity23 of a bacteria that can cause potentially fatal food poisoning in ingredients sold to eight countries exposes @entity2 's vulnerability to food safety scares and the fragility of the clean , green image underpinning its farming - and tourism - based economy			1
agricultural exports , including dairy , meat , fruit and wine , command high premiums internationally thanks to @entity2 's reputation as a producer of safe , natural and high - quality food			1
' it was only a matter of time before our dirty little secret came out , ' said @entity46 , brand strategist at @entity47 , a brand agency in @entity49			0
' @entity23 is our largest exporter and they 're completely intertwined with @entity2 's image and also they 're the absolute biggest benefactor of the " 100 % pure " brand			1
' when you 're coming out with something that presents itself as fact , or 100 per cent pure , then you have to be 100 per cent pure and we 've proven that we 're not			1
' @entity2 's primary sector , which includes fishing and forestry , accounts for some 60 per cent of exports and 18 per cent of the country 's $ 160billion gdp , among the highest proportions in the developed world			1
tourism makes up another 10 percent or so of gdp			0
the country has long marketed itself internationally with the ' 100 % pure ' slogan in print and tv ads , drawing millions of visitors each year to experience its national parks , beaches and lakes			2
pollution : early morning light shines through the smog in @entity76 , @entity2 contaminated : a notice warning of industrial liquid pollution in the @entity79 , @entity76 in @entity2 with barely 4.5 million people spread over a mountainous area larger than the @entity82 or @entity83 and more than a quarter of that set aside for reserves and national parks - the backdrop for the popular @entity89 movie trilogy - @entity2 has no shortage of unspoilt natural attractions			2
but the marketing overlooks a dark side to the country 's environmental credentials			2
more than 60 per cent of @entity2 rivers monitored by the @entity97 had ' poor ' or ' very poor ' water quality and were rated as unsafe for swimming due to pollution			1
dairy farming , which has a lot riding on @entity2 's strong environmental reputation , has been a significant cause of poor river quality due to fertiliser and effluent runoff			1
unlike many other countries , @entity2 cows are kept on grassy pastures year - round , a major selling point for its $ 9billion annual global dairy trade			2
the country has long marketed itself internationally with the ' 100 % pure ' slogan in print and tv ads , drawing millions of visitors each year to experience its national parks , beaches and lakes facade : @entity2 trades off its natural beauty , but many rivers are too polluted to swim in @entity124 plant in @entity125			1
a botulism scare at @entity23 was the company 's second contamination issue this year after it earlier found traces of dicyandiamde , a potentially toxic chemical , in some products ' because we 've had a lack of regulation on farm waste for 20 years it 's been a free for all , so farmers have done what they can to produce more milk - which is to put more cows on pastures , ' said @entity143 , an ecology and environmental sustainability scientist at @entity146			2
prime minister @entity147 , who has been previously criticised for saying the 100 % pure marketing should be taken with a pinch of salt , said @entity2 would always be reliant on dairying , with its natural competitive advantage and global demand rising			1
' the right answer is not for @entity2 to sell less dairy			2
the right answer is for @entity2 to be absolutely sure that the safety standards are met , ' he said on tuesday			0
more than 60 per cent of @entity2 rivers monitored by the @entity97 had ' poor ' or ' very poor ' water quality while separate from its environmental credentials , @entity2 's food safety record is also not without stain			1
until the late 2000s , @entity2 had the highest rate in the developed world of food - borne campylobacteriosis , a serious and sometimes deadly disease caused by a bacteria often found in uncooked chicken			2
by 2011 , even after a major government initiative to control the epidemic , @entity2 still reported incidents of the disease at more than double the rate of nearby @entity173 and 12 times the rate of the @entity175 , according to the @entity176			0
the botulism scare at @entity23 was the company 's second contamination issue this year after it earlier found traces of @entity181 , a potentially toxic chemical , in some products			0
even so , @entity2 has one of the most stringent food safety regimes in the world and the recent dairy product scares only turned up with the sophisticated and sensitive testing available			1
@entity23 expects the current contamination issue to be resolved within days			0
a protracted , major animal health incident , rather than a localised contamination issue , could wreak havoc on the @entity2 economy			0
a decade ago , at the height of a foot and mouth epidemic in @entity197 , the @entity194 modelled the impact of a limited outbreak of the livestock disease - estimating an immediate 20 per cent hit to the currency , as well as a 12 per cent fall in exports and an eight per cent hit to gdp in two years			0
' we 've got to wake up and look more closely at our green credentials , and work harder to create a pristine environment so consumers can get a product which matches the story , ' said a consultant to @entity2 companies operating in @entity212			0
' we ca n't be complacent			0

despite marketing claims , @entity2 has a poor environmental record
food scares and poor water quality cast doubt on ' 100 per cent ' pure slogan
