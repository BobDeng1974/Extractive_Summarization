click here to read the full story on @entity3 's offensive text about @entity5 chairman @entity4			1
former @entity7 chairman @entity6 has called for @entity3 to be banned from football for at least a year after @entity9 revealed his racist text and email exchanges with @entity12			1
although @entity3 insisted he was guilty of sending only three racist texts ‘ out of 10,000 ’ recovered from @entity12 ’s phone as part of a @entity5 investigation into eight transfers during his tenure as manager , this newspaper revealed another tranche of messages that further exposed the 42 - year - old @entity24 on saturday morning			1
in one , @entity5 believe @entity3 called @entity25 club owner @entity4 a ‘ chink ’			1
@entity3 gave a tv interview on friday night in which he insisted he was not racist , sexist or homophobic			0
he did , however , accept that the texts he sent to @entity12 — then head of recruitment at @entity5 and until his resignation last week the sporting director at @entity33 — were ‘ unacceptable ’ and ‘ inappropriate ’			1
under fire : @entity9 has revealed a number of controversial text messages sent by @entity3 offensive : @entity3 referred to @entity5 owner @entity4 ( @entity38 ) as a ' chink ' in one particular text message punishment : former @entity7 chairman @entity6 believes @entity3 should be banned for a whole season @entity9 understands there is a real appetite at the @entity7 to punish both @entity3 and @entity12			1
the governing body has made no comment because it could prejudice their investigation after evidence was passed to @entity50 officials by @entity5 ’s lawyers			0
but insiders at the @entity7 expect the two men to be charged in the belief that this can not be compared to previous cases , in which privacy has been given as a reason not to proceed			0
@entity6 , who served as @entity7 chairman between 2008 and 2010 , told the @entity60 yesterday that @entity3 should be banned from football for a season simply on the strength of the three messages he has admitted sending			1
‘ there could very well be a significant period in which he can take no part in football , ’ said @entity6			2
‘ if it turns out to be three texts then maybe a season ( ban ) , if it ’s more than that may be much more			0
assuming that the evidence is stacked up — i ca n’t pre-try it — i think the @entity7 , in the same sense that it can say to players , “ here is a period in which you can take no part in playing ” , could do so with other people in football			2
’ read it here first ! how @entity9 broke the news over @entity3 's texting shame i 'm sorry : @entity3 apologised for any offence caused by his messages in an interview with @entity89 revealed : @entity9 's chief sports reporter @entity90 uncovered the shocking messages sent by @entity3 gone : @entity12 ( c ) left his role as @entity33 's sporting director after allegations against him the full picture : @entity9 brought the behaviour of @entity3 and @entity12 to light earlier this week @entity98 , the chairman of anti-discrimination campaign group @entity100 , told the @entity60 yesterday that the case highlights a greater need to address prejudice and bigotry in sport			1
‘ it ’s very difficult to prescribe what is appropriate , ’ he said			0
‘ my concern is that we ’re talking about one individual and focusing on that individual and i understand why that is , but we ’re talking about the wider implications for the game			0
' @entity3 is probably thinking , “ hey , i ’m unlucky , i ’ve got into a situation where all my texts have been forensically examined ”			2
if that happened to every other football manager , senior administrator and other people at top levels of the game then there would n’t be many people working in the football , the game might just collapse			0
‘ i think what we have got to recognise is that there is a serious problem about prejudice and bigotry and where that is in the hands of people with power , something ’s got to be done and it ’s got to be done now			0
under investigation : the @entity7 have begun looking at a dossier of messages between @entity3 and @entity12 criticised : @entity5 have called for @entity139 chief executive @entity138 ( @entity38 ) to quit his role ‘ the @entity3 case is a microcosm that enables us to focus on what is a real , serious problem			1
if football is going to get to grips with this it has an opportunity now and that ’s why the role of the @entity7 is important			2
‘ you can say a season , two seasons , whatever , if we think that ’s it , close it off , we ’ve dealt with that and the problem is over , it is n’t			0
