by @entity0 despite an @entity5 career spanning 14 years , six tournament appearances and 114 caps , it is unlikely that @entity6 will have anything but heartache to look back upon following his retirement from international football			1
the captain called it a day on monday following yet another deeply disappointing @entity15 campaign but , from @entity16 in 2000 to @entity17 in 2014 , it is fair to say that he never got close to the success that he so badly craved			0
here , @entity20 charts the @entity5 career of @entity6 and the frustration that he never really got a chance to hit the heights that he was so capable of			1
@entity25 just two weeks after making his @entity5 debut , @entity6 came on as a substitute in the 1 - 0 win over @entity29 but could not prevent his side going out at the group stage			1
fresh - faced : @entity6 made his @entity5 debut two weeks before @entity25 @entity15 2002 scored in the famous 5 - 1 qualifying win in @entity29 — the finest hour for boss @entity34 — but missed the finals with a groin injury			1
highlight : @entity6 celebrates his goal against @entity29 in their famous 5 - 1 win in 2001 @entity40 played in all four games , and scored against @entity42 in the group stages			0
started against hosts @entity44 in the last eight but was substituted before the unsuccessful penalty shootout			0
too soon : @entity6 and team - mates celebrate going 1 - 0 ahead against @entity44 in @entity40			0
but they eventually lost on penalties			0
@entity15 2006 scored two goals in the group stages in @entity29 but missed his spot - kick as @entity5 were knocked out on penalties by @entity44 in the quarter - finals for the second successive tournament			2
dejected : @entity6 stands frustrated following defeat in the @entity15 quarter - finals to @entity44 in 2006 @entity59 was captain as @entity5 lost 3 - 2 to @entity61 at @entity62 and failed to qualify under @entity63			1
lowest point : @entity6 sits defeated on the @entity62 turf after failure to qualify for @entity59 following a 3 - 2 defeat to @entity61 @entity68 125 , @entity69 115 , @entity6 114 , @entity70 107 @entity15 2010 went to @entity71 as captain and scored an early goal in the opening game against the @entity75			1
but could do nothing to stop @entity29 shredding @entity78 ’s side to pieces in the last 16			0
rare elation : @entity6 celebrates scoring @entity5 's opener against @entity82 at the 2010 @entity15 @entity83 helped @entity5 qualify top of their group in @entity86 but after a desperate goalless draw with @entity88 in the last eight they went out on penalties , even though he scored from the spot			2
emotion : despite scoring his spotkick , @entity5 once again exited on penalties at @entity83 @entity15 2014 @entity95 led his country at a @entity15 but again it ended in disappointment , with @entity5 heading home after defeats to @entity88 and @entity100 and a goalless draw with @entity102 in the group stages			0
