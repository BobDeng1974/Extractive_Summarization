by @entity0 for @entity1 a fifth of all child and teenager deaths in @entity5 could be prevented , according to damning series of reports			1
researchers have found that a large proportion of the 5,000 infants , children and adolescents who die in @entity5 and @entity13 each year could be saved			1
a series of papers published in medical journal the @entity17 has found that , although the child death rate in @entity5 is low relative to population size , too many youngsters are being let down by doctors or social services			2
the number of preventable deaths in @entity5 has been branded a ' wake up call for healthcare professionals ' one paper showed that between 2010 and 2011 , 20 % of deaths of children and teenagers aged 18 and under in @entity5 could have been avoided			1
deaths that could have been prevented include many among newborn babies , youngsters with existing medical conditions and others killed by infections			1
dr @entity38 , president of the @entity39 , said : ' we 've known for some time that the @entity41 performs badly compared to its western @entity43 counterparts when it comes to child mortality rates			0
' but this paper reveals the startling fact that one in five child deaths in @entity5 could be prevented			1
this is a serious wake - up call for both healthcare professionals and policy - makers and we have to act urgently			2
' president of the @entity53 says the figures show policy - makers have to act urgently to save children preventable deaths were defined as ' those in which modifiable factors may have contributed to death ' with causes including accidents , suicide , deliberately - inflicted injury , abuse or neglect , and acute medical conditions			1
one of the papers found clear regional differences in child death rates around @entity5 and @entity13			2
they tended to be higher in the @entity73 and the @entity74 than in the @entity75			0
the one exception was the @entity77 , where death rates were relatively low			0
lead researcher @entity79 , from the @entity80 , said : ' what these variations in mortality tell us is that more could be done to prevent child deaths across all age groups			0
' although some contributing factors are relatively fixed , including a child 's age , sex , and genetics , many environmental , social , and health service factors are amenable to interventions that could lessen risks and help prevent future deaths			0
' for children aged one to four , the number of deaths per 100,000 of the population ranged from around 15 in the @entity101 to 23 in the @entity102			0
among children aged five to 14 , the rate varied between around eight per 100,000 in the @entity77 and @entity101 to 10 in the @entity102 and @entity104			0
dr @entity79 added : ' it needs to be recognised that many child deaths could be prevented through a combination of changes in long - term political commitment , welfare services to tackle child poverty and healthcare services			2

around 5,000 children and adolescents die in @entity5 and @entity13 each year
research now shows that up to *1,000* of those deaths could be prevented
the preventable causes include neglect , accidents or medical conditions
child health *expert* says the studies are ' a wake - up call ' for the *authorities*
