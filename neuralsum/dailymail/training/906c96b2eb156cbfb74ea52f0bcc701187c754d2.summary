the @entity32 and @entity132 are likely to get the best weekend weather			0
the unseasonal weather has been playing games with nature , with cats breeding earlier in the season than usual - causng issues at cat rehoming centres - and even leading to the first crop of @entity16 tomatoes arriving a whole month early			1
the unseasonable hot spell has ripened 100 tonnes of tomatoes which are not ordinarily picked until the end of april - but today , the first crop was handpicked			2
thousands of the tomatoes , which include piccolo and beefsteak varieties , have ripened rapidly this spring on the @entity150			0
they are now being harvested at @entity152 , nestled in the @entity153 , which is the single biggest tomato grower in the @entity16			2
the island supplies more than 8 million tonnes of tomatoes to @entity16 supermarkets every year			2
the @entity158 first grew tomatoes on the @entity150 because of its favourable climate to ensure a reliable supply throughout their reign			0
the island now grows more than 40 varieties			0
starting early : the first crop of @entity16 tomatoes was picked today a whole month early experts at @entity152 say the abundance of sunshine and warmth allows tomatoes to be grown for longer on the vine			1
this means greater sugar production which they claim makes them ' @entity16 ’s sweetest and tastiest tomatoes , bursting with vitamins and minerals '			1
@entity181 , growing manager at @entity182 , said : ' we are thrilled with this early burst of warm , sunny weather			0
' here on the island we feel good weather more , which brings out the best in our tomatoes ’ taste and quality			2

@entity221 has imposed a 20mph speed restrictions across a stretch of line in the @entity225 because of the effect the heatwave could have on the tracks			0
the curb on speed - called heat speeds - has been imposed between @entity231 and @entity232 near @entity233			0
@entity221 say the heat speed is a precautionary measure following weekend work			0
it blamed the restriction on the lower - than - normal heat tolerance of a new section of track			0
a spokesperson for @entity221 said : ' we have over the weekend renewed that small section of track and therefore its heat tolerance level is lower than the norm			0
' speed restriction is proactively imposed where necessary so that we lower the chances of track failure and avoid having to cancel trains altogether			0
' still , those who were not commuting or trapped in an office were finding reasons to get outside - such as @entity199 and @entity201 , both 23 years old from @entity255 , @entity83 , who enjoyed the heat in @entity258 yesterday afternoon			0
but make the most of it while you can - for while many have been soaking up the sun on beaches and parks around the country , as usual the clouds will roll in just in time for the weekend to provide us with a more traditional start to april			1
