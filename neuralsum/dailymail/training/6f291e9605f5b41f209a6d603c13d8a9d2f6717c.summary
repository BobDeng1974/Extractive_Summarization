by @entity0 vigorous gym sessions do wonders for our body , so why do n't we think about exercising our face ? beauty writer @entity6 has spent years travelling the world unearthing global beauty secrets for her @entity10 column			1
today she has combined her beauty knowledge with her love of fitness to create the world 's first face gym , a non-invasive finger - led facelift that recreates a typical gym workout with a warm - up , interval training and cool down stage			1
speaking to @entity21 about the concept , which has just launched in @entity23 as part of its @entity25 and been hailed a key beauty trend for 2014 , @entity6 explained that she has suffered several distressing treatments over the years so wanted to go back to basics and swap injections for good old - fashioned face massage			1
workout for your face : a new concept called @entity35 has launched in @entity23 and mimics a gym class to tone your face and beat wrinkles she said : ' @entity35 is grounded in the principal that we do n’t think twice about toning our muscles at the gym so why think differently about the face ? ' facial muscles are crucial to the way we look and with regular stimulation can lift , tone and tighten the skin , boost blood circulation and collagen production giving a fresh youthful appearance to the skin			2
beauty buff : @entity6 worked as the @entity54 ' undercover @entity10 for four years and has now unveiled the world 's first face gym , which she promises is the ultimate non-invasive , finger facelift ' there are over 650 muscles in the human body with roughly 50 concentrated in the face , it takes approximately 43 to frown , 17 to smile , but without proper stimulation , face muscles are prone to sagging			1
' @entity35 goes beyond the skin - our face trainers work deep into the muscles around key problem areas such as jowls , eyes and foreheads			0
' the signature £ 35 30 minute treatment consists of a warm up , cardio , and cool down with £ 15 ( 10 minute ) add - ons available o target specific treatment areas			1
@entity6 uses techniques she learnt from her sessions at celebrity favourite @entity82 and the @entity83 , which focus on interval training to make your muscles lengthen			1
@entity6 and her team use facial flicking , pummeling and fast finger movements to lift the cheeks , drain excess fluid from under the eyes and work on fine lines			2
she refuses to call it a ' facial ' , maintaining that it is more about ' sets , reps and packs '			0
the session promises to deliver results immediately , but @entity6 recommends going once a week for very visible results			0
if you 're looking to take the workout to the next level , @entity6 and her team offer ' mouth work ' , a 20 minute in - mouth massage , which promises to relieve tension and widen the mouth palette			0
while @entity6 is the first person to bring this concept to the beauty market , face massage has been practiced in ancient cultures for centuries and was once the secret of @entity118 practiced 3,000 years ago to increase circulation of blood and ' chi ' to the face			2
@entity6 does , however , promise that @entity35 is a ' unique , modern interpretation of an ancient practice '			0
