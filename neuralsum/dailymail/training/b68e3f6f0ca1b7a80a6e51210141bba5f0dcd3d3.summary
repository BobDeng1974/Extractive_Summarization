the bereaved mother of a victim of the 2012 @entity3 school shooting wrote a letter to herself remembering the woman she was before the horrific tragedy			1
as a way to mark the two - year anniversary of her 6 - year - old son 's death -- and the slaying of 19 other children -- @entity14 penned the emotional words that also detail the woman she 's become since the shooting			1
' two years ago , on december 14 , 2012 , the world changed and you changed with it , ' @entity14 wrote on today.com			1
understandably , the change that occurred in the @entity22 mother was major and took her from an upbeat , life - loving woman to a more reserved person always with one eye on life 's darker side			1
two years later , mrs. @entity14 would pen a public letter to her pre-massacre self ' no longer brimming with optimism , you are now someone far more realistic and still			1
and you look back so much more , ' she writes			1
her words are a meditation on grief as well as a call to action			1
' for all the @entity49 reading this now — this does n't have to be you , ' @entity14 writes			1
' because every gun - related death is a preventable death			1
' @entity14 urges parents everywhere to discuss with their children the facts about these deaths			1
@entity14 's youngest son @entity57 ( left ) died at the hands of @entity59 and his assault rifle			1
his older brother @entity61 ( right ) survived ' if you have five minutes , with your kids			1
if you have two hours , host a conversation with other parents , ' she writes			1
@entity14 is n't alone in her quest to spread awareness of gun violence			1
her fellow grieving mother spoke out against the epidemic on sunday , saying it has broken the hearts of other mothers across the country			1
' and just like our hearts were broken and we ca n't breathe , the hearts of the mothers in @entity79 , in @entity80 , in @entity81 , in @entity82 , in @entity83 , in @entity84 , they ca n't breathe , ' said @entity85 , who lost her daughter , @entity86			1
' and we should care			1
we should care when our children are lost to gun violence			1
' @entity92 , speaking at @entity90 's church service in @entity91 , recalled the moment two years ago when she and her husband were in the @entity3 firehouse , where officials were informing parents of the 20 children slain along with six educators at @entity3			1
she and her husband found their son , now a fifth - grader , but not their daughter			1
' but in that same firehouse , ' she said , ' my husband and i knew @entity107 was with @entity108 and that we would see her again			1
' after describing her own journey through darkness , @entity14 ends her letter on a note as positive as @entity92 's			1
she writes : ' i am beginning to feel some of my old optimism returning , because more and more people are engaging around this issue			1
our conversation is gaining momentum			1
i sense a sea change is coming			2
' ' your eldest son @entity61 survived , but was changed by the day he discovered some monsters are real			2
he describes it as the day " when hell came to my school " ' writes @entity127 via today to the mom i used to be : two years ago , you were happy and whole			1
you had a plan for life — start a new business , get involved in the school @entity133 , teach your sons how to ride bicycles and play sports , spend as much time with your friends and parents as possible , watch your children mature , grow old with your husband			1
you were optimistic — a ' glass half full ' person who saw the silver lining in every cloud and often felt so much joy you thought you would burst			2
you always looked forward — never backwards , no regrets			2
you smiled and laughed a lot			2
you are n't that person anymore			2
two years ago , on december 14 , 2012 , the world changed and you changed with it			1
a disturbed young man with access to high - powered firearms went to your sons ' school and killed six educators and twenty first - graders			1
your eldest son @entity61 survived , but was changed by the day he discovered some monsters are real			2
he describes it as the day ' when hell came to my school			1
' ' your beautiful baby boy who you thought of as pure love , with his captivating eyes , infectious giggle and warm deep cuddles , was killed			1
shot multiple times , dying instantly in the arms of his special education assistant who also died while trying to protect him , ' writes @entity14 your youngest son , your beautiful baby boy who you thought of as pure love , with his captivating eyes , infectious giggle and warm deep cuddles , was killed			1
shot multiple times , dying instantly in the arms of his special education assistant who also died while trying to protect him			2
the tragedy changed every single aspect of your life , not only because of the obvious absence of your child , but because of the constant hole inside you that can never be filled			2
your eldest son has been forced to grow up way too fast because of the unfathomable loss of his baby brother			2
the pain has altered the lines on your husband 's face			2
the way you look at the world has changed			2
your interactions with friends and family seem foreign			2
you 've become much harder			2
no longer brimming with optimism , you are now someone far more realistic and still			2
and you look back so much more			2
you view life through the prism of ' before ' and ' after			2
' @entity61 's fifth grade photos came recently			0
they are still sitting on a table because you have n't put them in the frame that sits next to @entity57 's last school photo			1
it 's too hard for you — too soon			0
but @entity57 is frozen in time forever			0
even after two years , there 's this denial that is still very present inside you			0
you have @entity57 's baby teeth and a lock of his hair on your bedside cabinet , beside the urn holding his ashes			0
that 's all you have of your little boy now			0
you suppress your feelings as much as you can because you fear if you really let it out , you would never recover			0
if you started truly crying , you would never be able to stop			0
and here 's the thing — you did n't have to be that @entity228			0
for all the moms and dads reading this now — this does n't have to be you			0
bereaved : @entity14 and her husband @entity33 ( center right ) are among the parents of 20 children who lost their lives two years ago at @entity3 because every gun - related death is a preventable death			1
these are not random acts			0
you ca n't ever say , ' this will never happen to me			0
' it can happen to anyone , at any point , at any place			0
you have to care enough and be insightful enough to do something before it 's too late			0
taking action to protect children from gun violence can take many forms			0
for some people that means fighting for policy and political change — that can be a long , frustrating road , and certainly not the only option			0
small but meaningful actions create change			0
if you have five minutes , start a dialogue at the dinner table about gun violencewith your kids			0
if you have two hours , host a conversation with other parents			0
if you can dedicate one day a month , work with educators on how to better recognize the signs of children who may be troubled and reach out to their parents immediately			0
but to do nothing ? that does n't honor the dead and does n't protect the living			0
one of the most important actions families , schools , employers and communities can do is learn the signs of someone in crisis and then intervene before they hurt themselves or someone else			0
we need to teach kids better anger management and conflict resolution skills , because much of gun violence stems from anger and fear			0
learning other ways to deal with anger and fear rather than striking out at someone is a good first step			0
we need to recognize the signs on social media — and know the difference between someone who is just angry and someone who poses an imminent threat			0
lines of communication always need to remain open between ourselves and our children			0
i am beginning to feel some of my old optimism returning , because more and more people are engaging around this issue			0
our conversation is gaining momentum			0
i sense a sea change is coming			0
i know everything we 're doing at @entity312 will protect more children			0
we 're fighting a good fight			0
but after every sort of victory , there 's also a moment of incredible sadness for me , for whatever happens , i know i still ca n't bring @entity57 back			0
that hole will never be filled			0
no matter how many lives get saved in his name , or in the name of others , i ca n't go back			0
but you can go forward and make a difference			0
with love , @entity14 , @entity57 's mom still going strong : here , the @entity330 ' surviving son @entity61 poses along with his parents			1
