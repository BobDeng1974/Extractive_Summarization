@entity2 scientists are working on an ' invisibility cloak ' for mosquito - plagued people , pets and livestock			2
the researchers have discovered substances that occur naturally on human skin and block mosquitoes ' ability to smell and target their victims speaking at the @entity28 of the @entity29 , research chemist @entity27 said that far from being a nuisance , mosquitoes are more deadly to humans than any other animal			1
in the @entity2 alone , mosquitoes spread rare types of encephalitis , an inflammation of the brain as well as transmitting heart worms to pet dogs and cats			2
dr @entity27 said : ' repellents have been the mainstay for preventing mosquito bites			0
' the most widely used repellant , @entity46 , is quite effective and has been in use for a long time but some people do n't like the feel or the smell of the repellant , he said			0
' we are exploring a different approach , with substances that impair the mosquito 's sense of smell			2
if a mosquito ca n't sense that dinner is ready , there will be no buzzing , no landing and no bite , ' he explained			0

scientists believe their research could be another step in the fight to stamp out malaria , which kills approximately one million people around the world every year female mosquitoes , which suck blood to obtain a protein needed to produce fertile eggs , can smell people from over 100 feet away			1
a person 's scent , dr @entity27 explained , comes from hundreds of compounds on the skin , many emitted through sweat and others produced by bacteria			2
to identify which of these attract mosquitoes , @entity27 and colleagues at the @entity95 at the @entity2 @entity96 's @entity97 in @entity98 , used a special mosquito cage divided by a screen			1
they sprayed various substances into one side of the cage and documented the effects in attracting mosquitoes			0
some compounds , like lactic acid - a common component of human sweat - were definite mosquito lures , drawing 90 per cent of the mosquitoes to the screen			1
with other compounds , however , many of the mosquitoes did n't even take flight or seemed confused			0
dr @entity27 said : ' if you put your hand in a cage of mosquitoes where we have released some of these inhibitors , almost all just sit on the back wall and do n't even recognise that the hand is in there			0
female mosquitoes ( pictured ) , which suck blood to obtain a protein needed to produce fertile eggs , can smell people from over 100 feet away			0
a person 's scent , dr @entity27 explained , comes from hundreds of compounds on the skin , many emitted through sweat and others produced by bacteria we call that anosmia or hyposmia ; the inability to sense smells or a reduced ability to sense smells			1
' he said that a group of chemical compounds , including 1 - methylpiperzine , block mosquitoes ' sense of smell			1
this may help explain why mosquitoes fly toward some people but not others			0
the substances have a molecular architecture found in ingredients in dozens of medicines and other products and they appear suitable for use in cosmetics , lotions , clothing and other products that currently incorporate mosquito repellants , he said			0
the @entity95 and @entity166 has been doing research on mosquito repellents since the 1940s			0
in the 1990s , it accumulated information on substances secreted through the human skin or formed by bacteria on the skin that make some people more attractive to mosquitoes than others .			1

@entity2 researchers have discovered substances that occur naturally on human skin and block mosquitoes ' ability to smell their victims
the research could be used to help stamp out deadly diseases such as malaria , which kills approximately one million people every year
some compounds found in human sweat attract mosquitoes while chemical compounds , including 1 - methylpiperzine , block mosquitoes ' sense of smell
