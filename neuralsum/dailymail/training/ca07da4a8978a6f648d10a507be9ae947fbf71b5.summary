by @entity0 published : 09:28 est , 5 august 2013 updated : 09:32 est , 5 august 2013 scientists are working to unravel why there has been a surge in the number of beached dolphins found along the eastern coast of the @entity7			1
a total of 44 bottlenose dolphins were found in july , washed up along the southern part of @entity11 in @entity12 - around eight times as many as normal , according to the @entity14			1
researchers are struggling to work out the cause of the deaths , but suspect a virus is to blame , as a similarly morbid bout of dolphin deaths occurred in 1987 and were the result of a measles - like disease			1
scientists are working to unravel the cause of a surge in the number of dolphin deaths as a number of stranded mammals have been found beached along @entity32 @entity7 states			1
volunteers @entity34 ( left ) and @entity35 ( right ) record observations of a deceased male dolphin in @entity38 @entity12 the @entity39 has asked stranding centres situated along the coastline to record the number of dead dolphins found in a bid to find a pattern in the spikes			1
@entity48 , research coordinator for the @entity49 , told @entity50 : ' we 've had a steady number coming in at the beginning of the summer , and starting last week , the numbers spiked ... we 're just trying to keep our head above water			0
' the states of @entity57 and @entity58 has also seen a rise in dolphin deaths and according to a report in @entity62 of @entity63 , around 10 dead dolphins were found in a month - double that than usually recorded			1
scientists in @entity67 have reportedly said necropsy results have indicated pneumonia might be to blame , but a spokesman for @entity39 's @entity71 admitted no - one knows what is causing the mysterious dolphin deaths but data is being collected			2
the volunteers load a deceased male dolphin onto a metal stretcher on the beach in @entity12			1
this was their third dolphin retrieval of the day			0
officials are trying to determine the cause of a sharp increase in dolphin deaths in @entity12 and other @entity32 states however , the stranding team in @entity12 said the numbers of dolphins found beached reminds them of mass deaths that occurred in 1987 , when over 750 carcasses were washed ashore between @entity92 and @entity67			1
it took a few years to determine that morbillivirus - a disease similar to the measles - was to blame but the dolphins did show symptoms similar to those of measles and pneumonia			1
ms @entity48 said : ' it 's eerily familiar ... that is one virus we 're looking for now			0
' bottlenose dolphins live in pods of between two and 15 creatures off the @entity32 of the @entity7 and spend the majority of the year in the warmer southern waters , before moving to the bays of the @entity114 between may and october , @entity105 , director of the @entity106 in @entity107 , @entity67 , told @entity116			2
five beached dolphins like the one pictured were found in @entity12 alone on thursday			2
in july , nearly four dozen dead dolphins were found , mostly in @entity38 and along the southern part of the @entity11 - over six times the number usually picked up in july by the @entity14 a total of 87 dolphin carcasses including those of the bottlenose species , have been collected by the response team in @entity12 so far this year , compared to a usual count of 87 dolphins for the entire calendar year			1
volunteers have had the unenviable task of collecting the dolphin remains - many of which are already very decomposed - which are analysed by marine biologists			2
it is difficult for the scientists to gain valuable information about any suspected virus when the carcasses are in bad shape			2
bottlenose dolphins , among the species found on the beaches , live in pods of between two and 15 creatures off the @entity32 of the @entity7 and spend the majority of the year in the warmer southern waters , before moving to the bays of the @entity114 between may and october while it appears sonar is not to blame for the dolphins deaths , it could be killing blue whales , according to a study by the @entity156 based in @entity157			2
it found baleen whale species , which include the blue whale , react to the mid frequency noises by changing behaviour			0
this includes altering foraging so they miss out on high - quality prey , which could make them weak and decimate numbers through starvation			0
the soundwaves , developed by the military to track enemies beneath the waves , are between 1 and @entity174 , which is within the human hearing band			0
they have been blamed for lethal mass stranding of deep diving toothed whales			0
@entity180 is thought to disrupt the animals ’ diving behaviour so much that they suffer a condition rather like ‘ the bends ’			0
the volunteers are combing the coast to find bodies of newly - dead dolphins to give the scientists a better chance of finding animals that might help them come up with the reason for the deaths			1
@entity196 , a volunteer with the @entity14 described the smell of the pinky - white carcasses as a cross between a pet shop and rotting fish			0
she told @entity50 - pilot : ' you get used to the smell , but i never can really get it off my hands ... i try to scrub them over and over again			0
' ms @entity48 said the volunteers have not seen any physical marks of trauma on the dolphins ' bodies that would indicate they have gotten tangled in nets or confused by sonar systems used by the @entity214 , that have been blamed for whale and dolphin beachings in the past			1
@entity218 , a spokesman for the @entity214 's @entity219 in @entity38 , told @entity50 there has been no change or increase in sonar use that could be related to the increase in dolphin deaths			0
around 60 volunteers plus interns and permanent staff are working in @entity12 to determine the cause of the deaths but they do not have specialist labs and are working from tents			2

44 dead dolphins have been washed up along the @entity7 state of @entity12 in july - eight times more than normal
a disease similar to measles wiped out over 750 dolphins in 1987 and scientists are keen to unravel the mystery to help the surviving mammals
volunteers are collecting dolphin carcasses - which do not appear to show signs of physical trauma - for further *examination*
