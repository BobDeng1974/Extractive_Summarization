the hippopotamuses can be seen locking jaws in battle as blood gushes out from their wounds			2

face off : a young male , pictured right , challenges an older bull over his territory at @entity21 in @entity22 tussle : the male hippos - which can weigh up to three tonnes - are the third largest land mammal in the world and are known for their aggressiveness			1
here , the younger male can be seen pushing forward with an explosion of water towards his target mr @entity20 , from @entity36 , said : ' the two pink giant hippos met in a head - on collision			2
it was a spectacle so sudden and violent , it was painful to watch			0
' if we thought this would be a lumbering , slow - motion drama we were in for a shock			0
' mr @entity20 then went on to describe how the two hippos battled for ten minutes until a winner could be decided			1
he continued : ' for ten minutes , water was thrown high into the air as they surged at each other , their foot - long tusks jabbing into pink flesh , each trying to turn or out - climb the other to deliver a decisive blow			1
' the challenger , with slighter build , was more adept and his strategy of gravity - assisted plunge from above seemed to be winning the battle			0
killer tactics : but as the younger male surges forward , the older bull lowers himself into the water and impales the young hippo on his tusks lethal : with the younger male 's momentum pushing him onwards , the older male lifts his bottom tusks up into his opponent 's neck victorious : the older hippo manages to best his younger contender by impaling him further on his lower tusks as he pulls back his head ' but the old bull was not quite ready to surrender himself , or his mudbank of females , to the young pretender			1
the rival surged forward , rising through a mass of churning water in a last , towering effort , but the big guy had his own trick to play			0
' throwing back his head in an enormous gape , he slid deftly forward , the opposing colossus impaling heavily onto his massive lower tusks			0
the rival 's own weight had done the damage and with blood visibly gushing , he turned to escape			0
the heavyweight contest was over			0
' through it all , we had been shooting furiously , but now emerged from behind our cameras to watch , spellbound , as the animal celebrated his victory with a monster yawn			0
' angry , angry hippos : the younger hippo knows he is defeated and starts to retreat away from the old bull in surrender retreat : the older male hippo has maintained his territory and female mates for the time being the sound of success : the older male hippo roars after fending off his younger competition			1
