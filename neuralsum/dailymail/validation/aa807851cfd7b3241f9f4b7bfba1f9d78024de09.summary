@entity0 has given a vote of confidence to @entity3 by insisting that the former @entity5 no 1 can still make the world ’s top 10 when she finally gets back from injury			1
the @entity9 , among the all - time greats of the women ’s game , reckons that @entity13 can make up for lost time despite having been out for 14 months with a wrist injury that required surgery last april			1
@entity0 offered her endorsement as current great @entity5 no 1 @entity20 went out of the @entity22 second round on saturday , beaten 7 - 5 , 3 - 6 , 6 - 4 by world no 15 @entity24 after creating enough chances to have won			1
@entity20 makes her way off the court after crashing out of the @entity22 to @entity24 @entity20 was beaten 7 - 5 , 3 - 6 , 6 - 4 by world no 15 @entity24 at @entity28 on saturday ‘ yes it has been a very long but @entity3 is still young so she will be fine , ’ said @entity0 , speaking at the launch of her new @entity32 clothing line			1
‘ if she was 27 or 28 there would be a problem but she has got plenty of time on her side , ’ said the 18 - time @entity35 winner			0
‘ i was very impressed with her at @entity42 in 2013 before the injury			0
i was thinking top 10 for sure and that can still be attainable			2
but she has got to get herself really fit for her return to the tour and that is going to be tough for @entity3			0
’ current @entity5 @entity48 ( left ) shakes hands with @entity24 at the net after their second round match @entity3 has been backed to reach the top 10 upon her return from a 15 - month injury lay - off there are signs that @entity13 may finally be ready for a return to action in time for may ’s @entity59 in @entity60 , despite missing out on @entity61 and taking her name off the entry list for next month ’s @entity66 event in @entity67			1
when she does come back , however , it is likely to be at a lower - profile event			0
meanwhile , her long - time friendly rival @entity20 resumed at 5 - 7 down in her rain - delayed contest with @entity24 , having missed a set point the previous afternoon before a deluge arrived			1
the final two sets proved to be as wildly undulating as the first one had been			0
the 22 - year - old from @entity78 , breathing down the neck of her career - high ranking of 38 , will know that this was a match she could have won against a player who has been as high as no 5 in the world but has suffered a disappointing year to date			0
@entity20 plays a shot at the @entity86 - she has been out injured after needing surgery on her wrist former @entity9 tennis star @entity0 has backed @entity13 to return to her best and make it to the top 10 with a little more composure she would have done , and an indication of how much it hinged on the more vital moments was that she ended up with more points than her more experienced opponent , with 113 to 111			1
the games often came in blocks as two nervous combatants became confident and then fearful again , depending on the scoreboard			0
in relatively cool conditions for this event , @entity20 went 2 - 0 up in the second , then 3 - 2 down , before reeling off the next four games			2
@entity20 ' will be fine ' as she is very young , according to former @entity104 @entity24 , a left - hander who has been to the @entity42 semi-finals , then surged to 5 - 1 as @entity20 was broken immediately in the decider , losing one point through a volleying error of astonishing simplicity			2
the anxious @entity110 looked tired — ‘ she ’s knackered , @entity20 ’ cried out an @entity112 voice — and @entity20 duly got back on serve to 4 - 5 before four unforced errors sealed her fate			2
it could have been a different end to this segment of the season , and once her doubles is over she will be concentrating on the clay courts .			0
