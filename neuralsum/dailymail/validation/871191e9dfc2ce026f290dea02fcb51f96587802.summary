one of @entity1 ’s most popular online bookmakers has been branded a ‘ rip - off company ’ after failing to honour odds offered during a crucial @entity4 match			1
furious customers are demanding a bigger payout after placing wagers with @entity9 that the @entity11 side would be knocked out of the @entity12 by @entity13 on wednesday night			1
the firm ’s mobile phone app was offering odds of 25 - 1 for a @entity13 win in extra time – but when it came to settling the bets , they paid out at just 9 - 2			1
it means the winnings for a £ 10 wager would have been cut from £ 260 to £ 55 , including the return of the original stake			0
the longer odds were offered while @entity4 were leading 2 - 1 in extra time			1
but the @entity42 side equalised , despite being reduced to ten men , and won the two - legged clash on away goals			0
punters who successfully bet on the result were told they would be paid less than they expected only after the match was over , with an email sent from the company blaming an ‘ administration error ’			2
@entity53 celebrates scoring @entity13 's first goal during the @entity55 of 16 , second leg match against @entity4 @entity56 , 26 , was expecting to win £ 150 plus his £ 6 stake back – but profited by only £ 27			1
he said : ‘ it ’s false advertising			0
i made the bet based on 25 - 1 odds , not 9 - 2			1
it was only when it came time to pay up that i noticed the odds had changed			2
‘ if they can do this because of an “ error ” , they can do it for all their odds			0
they could triple their odds and after people have bet say , “ oh no , it was a mistake ” and not pay out			2
’ @entity75 mp @entity74 called the move ' outrageous ' @entity75 mp @entity74 said : ‘ this is outrageous			0
what would have happened if a rival firm had better odds but people chose @entity9 because of the 25 - 1 odds ? customers would have lost out			1
you ca n’t change the price after the sale			0
‘ @entity9 are clearly a rip - off company who are willing to take their customers to the cleaners and deceive them			1
this is typical of the gambling industry			0
’ @entity9 ’s managing director @entity91 said the longer odds were ‘ clearly ’ wrong			2
he said : ‘ occasionally mistakes happen			0
in this case a wrong price was displayed for around three minutes , and a small number of customers bet at the incorrect odds			0
these odds were clearly wrong – we showed odds of 25 - 1 when the true odds and the odds displayed by all other bookmakers was 9 - 2			1
we settled at the correct odds			0
’ the terms and conditions for the @entity9 app – which has been downloaded 700,000 times on to iphones and @entity111 – reserve the right to ‘ correct obvious errors and either settle bets at the correct odds or void bets ’ .			2
