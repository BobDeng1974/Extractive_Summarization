after weeks of leaking emails that painted top @entity3 executives as catty , crass and sometimes racist , posting highly guarded movie scripts online for public viewing , and ultimately threatening the possibility of a terrorist attack at theaters across @entity9 , @entity0 today saw their quest to stop the release of the @entity14 assassination film @entity15 foiled as the film officially became available to rent or own online , one day before it hits theaters and video on demand			1
it is a major victory for @entity22 considering all they had to go through just to get the film released , dealing with a massive hack that president @entity26 has called an act of ' cyber vandalism ' on the part of @entity0			1
after all that however , there seems to be yet another hurdle standing in the studio 's way - the film @entity22 fought so hard to release is getting slammed by critics			1
variety critic @entity59 starts of his review by stating that ' @entity0 is right to object ' to the film , this before he goes on to warn readers eager to see the film that ' an evening of cinematic waterboarding awaits			0
' that 's not all either , as he also calls the picture ' about as funny as a communist food shortage , ' and declares that ' @entity9 comes off looking at least as bad as the @entity0 ' in the film			1
@entity72 of the @entity73 seems equally unimpressed , especially with star @entity74 who , he notes ; ' mugs shamelessly to make sure we understand that he ’s being funny , which he ’s not			0
' as for the feel of the film , @entity72 writes ; ' @entity80 on a really bad night			2
' though a bit more mixed in his review , the @entity82 's @entity81 still declares the picture ' wildly uneven			0
' he is however slightly kinder than @entity87 in describing the feel of the film , which he believes ' has the comic batting average of a mediocre - to - average @entity58 sketch			1
' @entity93 of @entity94 notes that the film ' offers a few moments of casual brilliance , ' but ultimately ' trips itself up in the threads of its contrived absurdity			0
' sorry bud : @entity74 is described in one review as not being funny almost every critic does however praise the performance of @entity104 , who plays @entity14 in the film			1
@entity106 , perhaps best known for playing @entity107 , the political rival of @entity109 ' @entity108 on @entity110 , delivers a ' sympathetic ' and ' complex ' performance as the @entity112 according to @entity114 's @entity113			0
he is also singled out by @entity116 of @entity117 , in a review that uses a now familiar comparison to describe the film			0
' it ’s @entity106 ’s performance that elevates the premise of a routine snl sketch into the stuff of a compelling and genuinely radical feature , the actor portraying @entity14 as an endearingly deranged despot with nuclear daddy issues , ' writes @entity116			2
praise : despite the mixed to bad reviews , the performance of @entity104 as @entity14 is uniformly praised by the critics @entity132 , who not only stars in the film but also wrote and directed the picture alongside his childhood pal turned writing , directing and producing partner @entity138 , also gets some love in a rave review from @entity141 at @entity142 , who compares the interview to the last film he and @entity138 wrote and directed , the critically praised disaster comedy @entity147			1
' @entity138 and @entity132 navigate this minefield of prurient humor and political incorrectness with aplomb , delivering a high - concept spy thriller comedy that feels as carefree as this is the end while managing not to ruin the thrills by too clumsily dumbing down the realities the film plays with , ' writes @entity141			2
the film also got high marks from @entity161 critic @entity160 who praised both @entity132 and @entity74 's work in the picture while also applauding the comedy 's ' bad taste			1
' writes @entity160 ; ' the interview hits the sweet spot for raunchy fun and spiky lampooning because @entity74 and @entity132 are effing hilarious and fearless about swinging for the fences			0
' history repeating : many reviews also make mention of the 2004 film @entity9 : @entity175 , which was a satire about @entity177 , the father of @entity14 , and also ended with his death it is also worth noting that more than a few critics make mention of the last film to mock a @entity0 leader , the @entity183 and @entity185 comedy @entity9 : @entity175 , which told the story of a paramilitary anti-terrorism force based out of @entity188 who were tasked with stopping a terrorist plot crafted by @entity14 's father , former @entity0 leader @entity177			1
the film is remarkably similar to the interview in its ridiculous characterization of the villain , in this case @entity177 , and also ends with the death of the @entity0 leader			0
unlike the interview though , the characters in @entity9 are all marionettes and not actual actors			0
that film was released in 2004 to no real controversy , save an order from @entity177 that the @entity204 to ban the film			2
the @entity204 refused his request .			0
