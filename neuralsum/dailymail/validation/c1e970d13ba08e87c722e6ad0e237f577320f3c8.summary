@entity0 believes winning the @entity2 title this year would top @entity4 ' comeback triumph of 2013			1
two years ago @entity4 became the first team to win the championship after losing their first game and history could repeat itself should @entity10 's side overcome @entity11 - chasing @entity12 at the @entity13 on saturday			1
@entity4 lost their first game of the 2015 championship to @entity17 in @entity18 but back - to - back wins in @entity20 and @entity21 have put them back into title contention			1
@entity0 takes on the @entity25 defence during his side 's victory in @entity28 in round three ' 2013 was great and the win against @entity17 at the end was probably the most satisfying i 've had , ' said @entity34 number eight @entity0			1
' to lose the first game in 2013 [ to @entity12 ] and to have people on your backs and knocking you down ... then to come back from that as a team was great			2
' when the final whistle went against @entity17 it was amazing , but if we could replicate that it would probably be even better			0
' just doing it again i think would make it better			0
' @entity4 ' title hopes seemed a distant dream when @entity17 recovered from a first - half deficit in the tournament opener to run out 21 - 16 winners			2
but successive wins on the road in @entity53 and @entity28 have lifted @entity55 spirits before confronting impressive @entity57 opponents who have already recorded victories over @entity59 , @entity21 and @entity17			0
@entity0 brings down @entity21 prop @entity60 as @entity10 's side triumphed at the @entity21 ' the boys put a good shift in and we got the result we wanted in @entity28 , ' @entity0 said of last weekend 's @entity21 success			1
' it was a good day at the office for the pack and the platform we had at the scrum , especially for me , was noticeable			0
' it 's what we want going forward and the longer we spend together the more we seem to get better			0
' hopefully we can build on last weekend and keep our tournament alive			0
' @entity0 seems set to lock horns again with his old @entity34 team - mate @entity77 as the @entity12 number eight is on course to make a dramatic return from injury			1
@entity77 cracked three vertebrae when he was kneed in the back by @entity21 lock @entity84 in @entity85 last month , but @entity0 believes @entity12 will do everything in their power to have the @entity89 man available at the @entity13			1
@entity0 seems set to lock horns again with his old @entity34 team - mate @entity77 in @entity18 on saturday ' he 's a great guy and a great player who 's made a name for himself for many years now , ' @entity0 said			1
' he 's an important player for @entity12 and one of their leaders , so if we stop his game maybe it will slow the rest down			2
' but there 's another 14 players you 've got to stop as well and @entity12 are definitely favourites			2
' they had a really good autumn series beating @entity105 and @entity106 and they 're on fire at the moment			0
' they having lost for 10 games but we 've just got to do our job , do all the work on the training field and hopefully that will translate onto the pitch			0
