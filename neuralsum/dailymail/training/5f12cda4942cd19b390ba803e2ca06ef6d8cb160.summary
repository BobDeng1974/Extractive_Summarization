the image is part of a stunning series of pictures from the @entity15 's collection which give a unique glimpse into the city 's past past and present : an anti-union protester is marched away in @entity7 in 1962 , while the same fate befell suffragette @entity33 , who failed in her attempt to hand a petition to the @entity36 at @entity37 devastation : the @entity39 in @entity40 as seen after a bomb was dropped 1941 and as it looks today historical : back in the days when the @entity43 used to freeze , in the 17th - century , as people and animals slide around on the ice @entity6 has changed little since 1953 , where a soldier is seen getting his shoes polished , while @entity50 is pictured in @entity51 in 1926 and remains at the exact same spot today			1

now , the buildings of @entity77 gleam in the background in an area which has seen enormous change transport : the clothes and vehicles are different but the station is exactly the same at @entity6 as a soldier gets his shoes polished there in 1953 opposite old change in 1930 running from @entity88			2
the street was lost , as was the church , though its tower remains			0
the area is now called new change during the ' swinging 60s ' , @entity94 boasted many fashionable boutiques including @entity97 ( right )			0

the power station closed in 1981 and the building has been home to the @entity109 since 1995			0
