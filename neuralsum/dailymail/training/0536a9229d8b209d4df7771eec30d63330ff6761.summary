the government will ' build and sell ' family homes in a desperate bid to end @entity5 's housing crisis , ministers revealed today			1
treasury chief secretary @entity6 said 300,000 new homes a year were needed but building firms were failing to meet the demand			1
he said this had forced ministers to ' think radically ' and consider using taxpayers ' money to kick start a new housing boom			1
treasury chief secretary @entity6 said 300,000 new homes a year were needed but not being built mr @entity6 said : ' the message to the housebuilding sector would be simple : if you do n't build them , we will			1
' the proposal - unveiled today ahead of @entity22 's crunch @entity21 tomorrow - will be trialled at a former @entity24 base in @entity25 and could lead to homes being built twice as fast as the more conventional route			1
launching the @entity28 , which also includes details of £ 15 billion of road projects , £ 2.3 billion of flood defences and a range of energy programmes , mr @entity6 said the government had to act to address the housing shortage			1
he said £ 100 million was being made available for the new garden city at @entity38 , ministers will back the development of a 13,000 - home new town at @entity42 , in @entity43 , and the extension of the @entity45 to @entity46 will help unlock the construction of up to 11,000 properties			1
the affordable homes programme will also be extended for a further two years , mr @entity6 said			2
but in order to meet the demand for 300,000 new homes a year ' requires us to think radically '			1
' an idea that i have been promoting is direct government commissioning of housing			0
government - national or local - would take responsibility for ensuring the number of homes we need each year			2
' the message to the housebuilding sector would be simple : if you do n't build them , we will			0
' @entity67 ( left ) and the @entity69 chief @entity6 ( right ) hailed the publication of today 's @entity28 there will be a detailed review to examine the potential of direct government commissioning and the @entity75 will lead on delivering up to 10,000 new properties at the former @entity24 base at @entity78 in @entity25 to trial the model			1
' now it 's just a disused @entity24 base but soon it will be a development of up to 10,000 homes thanks to the pioneering action this government has taken in trialling the new delivery model , ' mr @entity6 said			2
' this is the first time in a generation that the government has owned land , led the development on it at this scale and considered commissioning homes directly			0
' the model would allow homes to be built quicker and give the state the ability to ' ensure developers build the most appropriate type of houses and the right associated infrastructure '			0
mr @entity6 said : ' we are examining in more detail the idea of direct commissioning as a solution for the whole country and piloting it on this enormously important site			0
' asked whether the need to build more homes would require the development of greenfield sites , mr @entity6 said he did not ' necessarily accept ' that would be the case			2
' that 's something that would need to be worked through in delivering this , ' he said			0
he said redeveloping public sector land , such as @entity78 , could help meet the demand : ' we have released sites in this parliament for about 100,000 homes , we think			0
we want to see a much more ambitious approach in the next parliament			0
' i think that is something that can really help to meet this agenda			0
' meanwhile treasury commercial secretary @entity67 said the compulsory purchase scheme could be changed , making it easier for people 's homes to be bought to clear the way for major infrastructure projects			2
he said : ' we will be publishing a consultation paper at the next budget to streamline and update the compulsory purchase regime to make it clearer , faster and fairer			0
