dr @entity6 faces allegations that his ' rude and abrupt manner ' left patients feeling bullied and intimidated and , instead of simply telling tobacco addicts their options , he informed them they would die horribly if they did n't quit			1
however the @entity1 , who practices in @entity13 , disputes the accusations and says that , even if he did use the word ' a * * * * * * * ' , it was not a description of his patient but was meant as ' a basic description of a part of his anatomy '			1

dr @entity6 faces claims that his ' rude and abrupt manner ' left patients feeling bullied and intimidated after a series of patient complaints about dr @entity6 's manner , @entity27 is now trying to have him removed from its ' @entity32 ' and the case is set to be heard by the @entity34 in february			1
in a preliminary decision last month , tribunal judge , @entity35 , said dr @entity6 stands accused of having a ' grossly unprofessional and unacceptable manner towards patients ' as well as poor record keeping and failing to provide ' clinically appropriate ' treatment in some cases			1
the @entity42 ( @entity42 ) launched an investigation after a ' significant number ' of patients requesting a transfer from dr @entity6 's practice raised concerns about his conduct and the treatment he was providing			2
detailing some of the ' highlights ' of the claims dr @entity6 faces , judge @entity51 added : ' a number of patients complained of no eye contact and / or rude and abrupt manner			2
patients complained of dr @entity6 being bullying and intimidating when they felt too ill to defend themselves			2
@entity27 is trying to have dr @entity6 removed from its ' @entity32 ' and the case is set to be heard by the @entity34 ' there is also a specific example of dr @entity6 allegedly telling a patient that he was an ' a * * * * * * ' and was going to die a ' horrible death ' and was a ' burden on him '			1
' in relation to that particular allegation , which he ( dr @entity6 ) does not accept , he says that whilst he may have used that word , it was not a description of the patient but a basic description of a part of his anatomy '			1
another patient who complained of ' foul language ' , claimed dr @entity6 had told him : ' now get out of my office , you 're p * * * * * * me off and no doubt you p * * * other people off as well '			1
judge @entity51 added : ' we read other examples of where dr @entity6 had n't simply given patients an explanation of the choices available to them if they continued to for example smoke , but allegedly told them that they would die a horrible death			2
' dr @entity6 was temporarily suspended from the @entity42 's @entity32 in october 2010 , but judge @entity51 refused to extend that and he has been back on the list , subject to an agreed regime of ' strict and intensive monitoring and supervision ' , since the december ruling			0
in her decision , judge @entity51 said ' no adverse professional findings ' had ever been made against dr @entity6 , who qualified in 1986 and is now in his mid- 50s			0
the judge made no findings on any of the allegations faced by dr @entity6 , none of which have been proved , and observed : ' overall , our view is that whilst troubling , conduct and negative language to patients , are issues that are capable of being remedied			0
' despite claims that dr @entity6 's treatment of some patients was not ' clinically appropriate ' , she said it was ' not a case of glaring error or omission '			0
and restoring his name to the @entity32 pending the full hearing of his case , judge @entity51 concluded the continued suspension of an experienced gp was neither necessary to protect the public nor otherwise in the public interest			0
dr @entity6 's case has now been listed for a full hearing , expected to last at least five days , before the @entity34 in february .			0
