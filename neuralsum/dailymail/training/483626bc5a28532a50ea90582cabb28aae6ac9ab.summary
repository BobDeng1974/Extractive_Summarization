by @entity0 published : 16:23 est , 5 january 2014 updated : 04:32 est , 6 january 2014 steakhouses around the world are well - known for touting their authenticity			0
but this @entity6 restaurant went the extra mile to show off their chargrilling process by setting an entire billboard on fire			0
these dramatic images show the moment the stunt promoting the food at @entity16 , in the city of @entity18 , got underway			1
but one night , a pair of men dressed in chef outfits and armed with a flamethrower set the billboard alight along eight lines , mimicking the effects of a flame - grilling			1
before : the billboard began its life as an otherwise unmarked photograph of a slab of beef bringing the fire : two men dressed as chefs used a flamethrower to set the board alight though the board was only alight for a matter of seconds before the fire was extinguished , the aftermath left realistic - looking char marks along the meat - giving the illusion that it had been grilled			1
although the trails of smoke emanating from the billboard soon faded , the ' cooked ' piece of meat was visible to pedestrians and drivers the next day			0
the transformed ad also had the details of the @entity16 restaurant revealed so intrigued viewers could try out the steaks for themselves			0
extinguisher : after the flames had burned for a short while , the men put out the billboard using fire extinguishers well done : after the flames had disappeared , authentic - looking whisps of smoke still drifted from the billboard taking the credit : after the stunt , a panel was revealed showing the details of the restaurant			2

@entity16 in the city of @entity81 organised the stunt
men dressed as chefs set a photograph of a raw steak alight
after the billboard was extinguished , the steak appeared to be cooked
