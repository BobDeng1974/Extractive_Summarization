the full story of the men 's transformation is in the june issue of @entity0 , which comes complete with a guide to transform your own body in only 10 weeks ' i ’m reasonably pleased with the physical transformation			1
but the biggest change was realising how much i was on autopilot before : exercising rather than training , with no goal or progression			0
ten weeks is n’t so long in the end			0

' a beating on the tennis court by his 70 - year - old father was all the encouragement @entity7 , 29 , needed to add some serious muscle			1
