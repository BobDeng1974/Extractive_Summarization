but the sexist or racist language of the 1970s is far less acceptable than it once was , research by the broadcasting regulator reveals			2
@entity1 ’s chief executive @entity8 , who is about to stand down after 11 years in the job , told @entity10 there has been a big change in tolerance levels in the past few decades			1
@entity1 chief says the @entity16 public has grown more tolerant - but still does not like discriminatory language on tv shows			1

‘ people are more tolerant of a degree of violence than they were			0
they are much more tolerant of certain forms of swearing than they were			0
‘ there are still some words – very few to be honest – but still some words which are off limits or only in certain circumstances			0
‘ they are much less tolerant , interestingly enough , of language which is regarded as discriminatory or unfair or unjust towards people			1
