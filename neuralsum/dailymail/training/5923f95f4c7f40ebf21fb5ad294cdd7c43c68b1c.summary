putting his foot down : @entity2 immediately decreed that no player under the age of 23 - no matter their standing in the team - should be allowed to order a sporty model @entity9 manager sir @entity2 has banned the club 's young stars from driving flashy sports cars from new sponsors @entity13			1
the club recently signed a multi-million - pound deal with the @entity17 car giant , who will become the name on the club 's shirts from the start of the 2014 - 15 season			1
as a gesture of goodwill , @entity13 immediately offered @entity9 's first - team stars a choice of luxury cars			1
and unsurprisingly , many of the club 's big names plumped for the @entity33 supercar			0
however , @entity2 immediately intervened and decreed that no player under the age of 23 - no matter their standing in the team - should be allowed to order a sporty model			1
this means players such as young striker @entity40 , 21 , and defenders @entity41 , 20 , @entity42 , 22 , and @entity43 , 22 , will be banned from driving anything not approved by @entity2			1
instead only the more experienced drivers , such as @entity46 , 33 , and @entity47 , 38 , will be allowed behind the wheel of the £ 32,000 sports car			0
in 2009 , @entity9 midfielder @entity50 wrote off his £ 200,000 @entity51 into a tunnel wall as he drove to @entity9 's training complex in @entity54			2
and in 2003 reserve striker @entity55 died in a collision with a lorry as he drove his grey 3 - series @entity58 in the early hours of the morning on the @entity60			0
the move is a classic case of @entity2 - a known micro-manager of his players - ensuring his young stars do n't get too big for their boots			0
@entity2 is acutely aware of how times have changed since taking over in 1986 and has accepted that he can not control every facet of his players ' lives the way he used to			0
stalled : @entity9 's youngsters wo n't be driving one of these iconic @entity74 banned : it means players such as defender @entity41 , 20 , left , and young striker @entity40 , 21 , right , will be banned from driving anything not approved by @entity2 but the 68 - year - old manager still becomes irritated by the manner in which young players are given too much too soon			1
two years ago , for example , it emerged he told players in the club 's youth squads they were not allowed to wear coloured football boots			2
while first - team stars such as @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity47 are free to wear what they like in order to keep up with the demands of their sponsors , @entity2 decreed that youth team and academy players must wear black			1
wrecked : in 2009 , @entity9 midfielder @entity50 wrote off his £ 200,000 @entity51 into a tunnel wall as he drove to @entity9 's training complex in @entity54 an @entity101 source said : ' sir @entity2 does n't like young players to get ahead of themselves			2
he thinks their feet should be on the ground			0
' last night a @entity9 spokesperson confirmed : ' as with most automotive partnerships , @entity13 will be offering players a car			0
the model will be dependent on their time at the club and driving experience			0

@entity13 will become the name on the club 's shirts from the start of the 2014 - 15 season
@entity13 immediately offered @entity9 's first - team stars a choice of luxury cars and most went for the @entity125
but @entity2 immediately decreed that no player under the age of 23 should be allowed to order a sporty model
@entity40 , 21 , @entity41 , 20 , @entity42 , 22 , and @entity43 , 22 , are among those banned
