by @entity0 , crime reporter published : 16:53 est , 7 september 2012 updated : 16:54 est , 7 september 2012 three vicious robbers dubbed the @entity4 stranglers were jailed yesterday for a crime spree that targeted wealthy young mothers			1
the trio singled out vulnerable lone women as they walked their children in pushchairs along the street in daylight			1
disguised with motorcycle helmets , hoods and balaclavas , they crept up on victims from behind and stripped expensive rings from their fingers after throttling them until they blacked out			1
@entity21 : jailed for 17 years lord : given eight and a half years @entity23 : sentenced to 21 years some of the victims , including one who was seven months pregnant and walking a 17 - month - old baby , feared they would be killed			1
detectives believe the men made more than £ 100,000 by selling the jewellery to a corrupt businessman in @entity33 ’s @entity32 district			1
the career criminals , responsible for hundreds of violent offences between them , spent the cash on overseas holidays and shopping sprees for designer clothes			2
judge @entity41 labelled the crimes ‘ gratuitous ’ and ‘ motivated by pure greed ’ as he jailed the men for a total of 46 years yesterday			1
speaking at @entity45 , he said all three men ‘ roamed as predators ’ and posed a significant danger to the public			2
@entity21 , 26 , terrorised the affluent @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 areas of @entity33 – known as @entity4 because of its high number of families with young children – with his school friends @entity23 , 29 , and @entity58 , 33			1
after stalking their victims on motorcycle or by car , they strangled them with a potentially deadly grip on the carotid artery in their necks			1
some of the women were punched and kicked , including one who needed reconstructive surgery to her jaw			2

it can now be revealed @entity21 ’s life of crime began when he kidnapped a 13 - year - old boy in an attack that shocked the nation and was compared to the killing of @entity92			1
he and two accomplices abducted @entity94 and strung him up by his feet before beating him to within an inch of his life in 2000 when he was just 15			2
but he has never been named publicly in connection with the crime because of an anonymity order imposed by an @entity101 judge			2
it emerged yesterday that he began strangling and robbing minicab drivers within a month of his release from the seven - year jail term in december 2006			1
last night , @entity94 ’s mother @entity106 , 45 , described @entity21 as ‘ pure evil ’ and said the special treatment he received in court opened the door to a life of crime			1

he was always considered more important than us			2
the judge treated him with kid gloves			0
‘ my son and i have to live with what he did every day			0
how he was allowed back on the streets i do not know			0
’ off the streets : the three men were jailed for a total of 46 years at @entity45 the court was told the gang ’s crimes began between october and november 2010 when three lone women were robbed of rings , watches and purses as they walked with their children			1

her £ 11,000 engagement was stolen and she came round to find her child screaming in an upturned pushchair			0
in another case a victim ’s seven - year - old son was left with post-traumatic stress disorder			0
police believe their crimes date back further to april 2009 when a woman was throttled in front of her two - year - old son			2
once the men were finally in custody for the robberies police put their lifestyles under minute scrutiny and discovered they were responsible for an extraordinary crime spree			0

@entity58 went to school in @entity82 with one of the @entity179 brothers , who were jailed for life after being convicted of throttling wealthy women to within an inch of their lives			1
in a shockingly similar series of robberies , @entity184 and @entity179 stole jewellery worth £ 300,000 in just four months in @entity33 in 2008			1
among their victims were tv presenter @entity190 and designer @entity191			2

she believes she only survived after pulling off her diamond engagement ring while pinned to the pavement			0
the wine industry worker , who has since left @entity226 to live in @entity227 , described how she struggled with two of the gang as she saw her children 's toys through her kitchen window			0
mrs @entity211 , a mother of four - year - old twins , said she kicked her attackers as they failed to get the ring off because her fingers had swollen			0
she said : ' the guy holding my throat was clearly the more experienced of the two and he was getting agitated			0
' at that point he tightened his grip around my jugular vein and i could literally feel the blood leaving my head			0
' i thought i was going to pass out or worse and he said : " get her to take the ring off "			0
i pulled it off and handed it to the other guy and they were off like a shot			0
mrs @entity211 was attacked in @entity53 , @entity33 , on february 24 last year			1
she was left with two black eyes because her glasses were rammed into her face during the struggle			0
