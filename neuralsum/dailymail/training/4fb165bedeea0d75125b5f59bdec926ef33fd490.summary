they are no strangers to the official portrait or , indeed , the wax figurine , but now @entity4 's @entity3 and @entity6 @entity5 have been immortalised in another substance entirely - chocolate			1
the life - size statues of the @entity4 royals are the work of @entity13 bakery , @entity12 , and join a group that also includes @entity15 and former @entity4 king , @entity17			1
making the enormous sculptures required a truly king - sized amount of chocolate - 340kg for @entity3 and 320kg for @entity5			1
the chocolate statues of ( l - r ) queen @entity5 , @entity3 , former queen @entity22 and former king @entity17 on display at the patisserie @entity12 in @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity4 @entity17 proved the heaviest hitter in chocolate terms , with a hefty 450kg of the sweet stuff needed for his likeness			1
@entity15 , whose sculpture is , unlike the others , made from white chocolate , required an impressive 350kg			2
@entity36 is former queen @entity22 , whose statue needed just 280kg of chocolate to complete			1
sadly for those who fancy finding @entity3 in their stockings , the sculptures are one - offs and will be polished off by the children of @entity12 ' owner come @entity46			2
the sculptures , some of which were first unveiled during christmas 2013 , are n't the first time the @entity4 royals have found themselves on the end of an unusual artistic tribute			2
in october , the @entity53 in @entity54 revealed their latest likenesses of the @entity4 royal family - but with rather less success than the @entity12			2
a roya treat : @entity3 , left , and former king of spain @entity17 have both been immortalised in chocolate in tasty company : the life - size statues of the @entity4 royals join a group that also includes @entity15 and former @entity4 king , @entity17 - @entity17 tradition : a few years ago the patisserie owners decided to celebrate @entity46 time by creating life size copies of prominent personalities made of chocolate with two patisserie chefs working for three months on each sculpture lowlights included a bizarre frozen - faced take on @entity5 and a creepy version of the usually adorable @entity76			1
odd - looking waxworks are n't only a problem for the @entity4 royal family , however , with the @entity80 royals also immortalised in a series of terrible statues			1
prince @entity83 , who now boasts an updated and considerably more lifelike waxwork at @entity85 's in @entity86 , was , until recently , another victim of a royal waxwork disaster			0
not only did the sculpture have hair that was noticeably lighter than the real @entity83 's copper hue , the figure also looked considerably more like @entity94 's boyfriend @entity93 than the prince			0
other horrible royal sculptures include the terrifying take on the @entity98 that once graced @entity85 's and an unusual rendering of the @entity83 that looked more like a @entity101 puppet than the royal himself			0
the non-chocolate versions : king @entity105 and @entity6 @entity5 pictured receiving @entity107 members at the @entity108 on december 15 , 2014 in @entity54 family : along with @entity3 and co , the museum has made waxworks of @entity17 and @entity113 frightening : the @entity4 royals are n't the only ones to be afflicted by bad waxworks as this one proves back to normal : the real @entity118 is much prettier ( and far less frightening ) than her wax doppelganger is it prince @entity83 ? @entity93 ! a terrible take on @entity121 ( left ) and a @entity83 that looks more like a @entity93 doll much better : the real royals are both better looking and a little more rugged than the waxworks one royal who has had no such problems with waxwork tributes is the @entity6 , whose @entity85 's sculpture is updated regularly to ensure it looks as close to the real thing as possible			1
the current version was made to coincide with the @entity133 in 2012 and wears a stunning silver lace dress embroidered with 53,000 @entity136 crystals			0
another set of royals to boast accurate waxworks are the @entity140 and @entity141 , whose likenesses first entered the waxwork museum shortly after their wedding in 2011			0
although the @entity140 ' smile does look slightly fixed , her long chestnut locks are spot on as is the dress - a copy of the blue @entity150 number worn to announce her engagement to prince @entity153			0
like prince @entity83 , the royal couple got a makeover this year , with @entity141 now sporting a pretty teal dress and a regal swept - back hairdo			0
big improvement : a new prince @entity83 sculpture that looks far more like the real thing was recently unveiled no problem : the queen 's waxwork is regularly updated and wears a dress that boasts 53,000 crystals new look : the latest statues of the @entity140 and @entity141 were unveiled in july			0

@entity3 and @entity5 of @entity4 have been immortalised in chocolate
