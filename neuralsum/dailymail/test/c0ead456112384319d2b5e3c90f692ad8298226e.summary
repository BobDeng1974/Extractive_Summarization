@entity0 has dismissed criticism of the lack of diversity in @entity5 's manifesto by claiming there was a ' half black ' party spokesman featured prominently - and ' one fully black person '			1
the @entity5 leader made the remarks after being asked at his manifesto launch last week to justify the scarcity of black and @entity14 faces in the @entity5 manifesto			1
it includes several photographs of the party 's top team although it was suggested the only black face in the document appeared on a page about overseas aid			1
mr @entity0 said the premise was wrong , with the picture of the party 's immigration spokesman @entity34 ignored			1
he told @entity36 : ' well firstly there was one fully black person			1
' mr @entity0 added : ' there was another one of our leading spokesman who is half black and that did n't get a mention			1
and he featured very prominently on page six			0
so the premise was wrong			0
' i thought what happened was really interesting			0
there was a journalist from one of our leading daily newspapers who made the comment you know , there 's only one black			1
' and what happened was that there was an eruption in the room as our black and ethnic minority candidates stood up and looked at this guy in a pretty hostile way			2
' the @entity5 leader - trying on hats at a campaign stop in @entity67 , @entity68 , today - made the remarks after being asked at his manifesto launch last week to justify the scarcity of black and @entity14 faces in the @entity5 manifesto the @entity5 manifesto included several photographs of the party 's top team although it was suggested the only black face in the document appeared on a page about overseas aid mr @entity0 added : ' what they were saying was we 're just about sick to death of the sneering media class trying to make @entity5 out to be something completely other than it is			1
' we 're a non-racist , non-sectarian political party but we do n't have all female quotas , we do n't have all black quotas , we treat everybody as being equal			2
' i think we 're a multi-racial society			0
i think the multicultural society is a much more contentious point and perhaps that 's the bit that may have gone slightly wrong			2
' over 10 % of our candidates come from @entity97 backgrounds			0
we 're probably more diverse in our membership than some of the other parties who talk about all of this in a sort of ' holier than thou ' way			0
' mr @entity0 said the party 's immigration spokesman @entity34 - who has dual heritage - was ' half black ' the @entity5 manifesto launch was overshadowed by a row over the number of black and @entity14 people included , after a journalist pointed out that the only image showed someone from an ethnic minority - an @entity117 woman in the overseas aid section @entity5 has also proposed to amend the smoking ban to allow pubs and clubs to open smoking rooms			1
the manifesto states these rooms would have to be properly ventilated and physically separate from non-smoking areas			2
mr @entity0 said : ' there are 76 pages in our manifesto and that is one little sentence tucked away in there			2
' it 's about freedom of choice that 's the point			0
thirty pubs a week are closing and a lot of them particularly in built up areas where they have n't got a big food trade			0
' they rely on people going into the pub at five , six o'clock after a hard day 's work and a lot of those people might not smoke all day but they want a smoke with their drink that evening			0
' he added of his party 's policy : ' would that burden the health service ? well let 's put it like this : the @entity157 says , that smoking related illnesses cost it £ 2 billion a year , all right ? tobacco tax is £ 12billion a year so i do n't quite buy the argument			0

@entity5 leader asked to justify lack of black and @entity14 faces in manifesto
but he said there was one ' half black ' person and one ' fully black person '
@entity5 's immigration spokesman @entity34 has mixed heritage
included in the manifesto was also a photo of an @entity117 receiving aid
