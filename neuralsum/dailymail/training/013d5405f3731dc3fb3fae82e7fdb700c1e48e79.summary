these colourful sketches offer an often literal interpretation of song titles from the decade that fashion forgot			2
seven - year - old @entity4 , from @entity5 , @entity6 , began drawing them after being exposed to his mother @entity8 's love of @entity11 music at an early age			1
the nostalgic mother says that with her passion for the decade it easily infiltrated her son 's lifestyle and the result is a photo series called drawn to the ' 80s			1
a woman with a rabbit out of a hat ? it must be @entity26 by the police @entity29 's @entity28 is interpreted as a rainbow with the word ' true ' in a cloud above it she said : ' i am obsessed with the @entity11 - maybe a little too much			1
movies , fashion , television , giant hair ... pretty much everything makes me nostalgic for that decade			0
' @entity4 's first favourite song ever at age two or three was whip it by @entity44 , which , of course , made me crazy happy			1
' @entity8 says that her son first began drawing songs after hearing an upbeat track on the radio			1
his sketches manage to be both literal and clever			1
for instance with @entity53 's @entity52 , he writes the entire alphabet but instead of including the letter ' @entity56 ' , @entity4 puts a question mark			1
the @entity27 's @entity26 is illustrated by a female magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat			0
and @entity62 's @entity61 becomes a shower of bright purple raindrops			0
here @entity4 draws @entity65 by @entity66 ( left ) and the @entity68 ' @entity67 ( right ) @entity8 says that her son has become almost as much as an expert as she is on the the 1980s seven - year - old @entity4 sketches 1980s songs with his felt - tip pens			1
here he draws @entity53 's @entity52 ' we mostly listen to @entity11 music at home and in the car and one day after hearing @entity76 by the @entity77 on our way to school , @entity4 came home and drew this for me			1
' he said it was us			0
he went on and on how much he liked the song and was n't it so pretty ? i agreed			0
' @entity4 's mother says that helping her son draw has become a great way for the pair to bond			1
' we started paying attention to the music that 's always on in the background and @entity4 started drawing what he heard			2
' this was our time together			0
i love sitting with him and sharing something i love so much with someone i love so much			0
footloose by @entity100 ( left ) and stuck on you by @entity102 ( right ) @entity4 was exposed to @entity11 music from a young age			1
pictured : @entity105 by @entity106 @entity107 ( pictured ) was the very first song @entity4 drew the drawings do n't usually take @entity4 more than five minutes to complete			2
pictured : @entity61 by @entity62 ' we put on some music and sit at the kitchen table			0
he always asks me the song title and when i tell him he 'll usually giggle and shake his head , then he gets down to business			0
' @entity8 ( pictured ) says that the drawing sessions help her and her son to spend quality time together she added that it may be a thoughtful process but it is not a particularly lengthy one			2
' a typical song takes @entity4 less than five minutes to draw			2
' we sit at the kitchen table and put a something on , usually by the time the song is over he is done with the drawing			0
' but sometimes he wants to make it really detailed and he 'll spend longer on it			0
' when it comes to picking a favourite @entity8 says the more literal @entity4 has interpreted the song , the better			1
' there are so many that i love , especially the first few that he did when they were super-literal			0
' like hot for teacher or @entity140 where the foot has broken off			0
' i also think his @entity143 is just great , people have requested that one on a t - shirt or a coffee mug			0
' having been drawing along to music for two years @entity4 has become quite the expert on the music from that decade			2
@entity8 says the more literal interpretations are her favourite			1
pictured : @entity152 by @entity153 @entity4 and his mum listen to music from the 1980s together while he draws the pictures			1
pictured : @entity157 by @entity158 ( left ) and our lips are sealed by @entity161 's @entity4 's interpretation of the @entity163 probably mirrors many of those desires of children his age as it includes sweets and ice cream ' his knowledge of @entity11 music continues to surprise me			1
yesterday we got in the car and turned on the radio and before i even heard what song was on he blurted out " @entity176 ! " ' but my all time favourite would have to be the first one he did which was @entity107			0
' i will never hear that song the same way again , and i 'll never not think of him in the back of the car in that little five - year - old voice asking questions about the music and talking about how pretty it was			0
' @entity4 creates a colourful ode to @entity188 ( left ) and @entity189 by @entity190 ( right ) @entity4 may have slightly misunderstood the meaning behind in your eyes by @entity194			2
