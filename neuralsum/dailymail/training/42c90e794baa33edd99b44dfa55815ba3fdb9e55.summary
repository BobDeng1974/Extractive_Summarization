by @entity0 published : 11:49 est , 3 october 2012 updated : 01:55 est , 4 october 2012 we are not going to visit @entity2 anytime in the next decade or two - so the next best thing is to bring some of the @entity2 back to us			1
so @entity4 is now looking for ways to bring @entity2 rock and soil back to @entity8 , allowing scientists to study the soil composition for the first time and investigate for signs of if the planet ever had life			1
the @entity15 is putting together different ways of returning a sample within the next 20 years , with @entity4 potentially choosing which path to follow by next february			2
one option involves ' multiple launches ' , a @entity21 which will fire rock and soil into space , from which it can be collected and sent back to @entity8			1
another option is to perform the mission in one shot - but that will put a lot of costs onto @entity4 in a small amount of time , and might just be too costly for the space organisation			1
@entity48 , team leader of the @entity15 , said : ' [ all the options ] have their pluses and minuses			0
samples loaded : capsules could be blasted into @entity2 orbit , and await pick up ' it gives you multiple ways to look at this problem , consistent with budget concerns , consistent with opportunities for collaboration , more technology , et cetera			2
' and that 's what we tried to do - bring all of those options forth to @entity4 for consideration			1
' another suggestion is that multiple curiosity - style rovers are sent to @entity2 , checking out many different sites			1
then @entity4 can cherry - pick the best samples , probably just from one location , and send them back			2
this has the benefit of increasing the chances of finding signs of life during such an expensive project			0
a manned expedition is still some way off - @entity83 repeats president @entity85 's 2010 wish that astronauts may get to within the vicinity of @entity2 by the mid- 2030s			2
@entity4 's @entity2 rover @entity88 held its @entity89 ( @entity89 ) camera about 10.5 inches ( 27 centimeters ) away from the top of a rock called ' @entity93 ; for a set of eight images combined into this merged - focus view of the rock			1
this context image covers an area roughly 6.5 inches by five inches ( 16 centimeters by 12 centimeters )			0
resolution is about 105 microns per pixel			0
the @entity93 rock is dark gray and appears to be so fine - grained that mahli can not resolve grains or crystals in it			0
@entity2 rock : this image covers an area roughly 6.5inches by five inches , and brings us its latest images anatomy of an image : the @entity88 's arm zooms in on the ' @entity93 ' rock , getting a close up of the small spot this means that the grains or crystals , if there are any at all , are smaller than about 80 microns in size			1
some windblown sand - sized grains or dust aggregates have accumulated on the surface of the rock but this surface is clean compared to , for example , the pebbly substrate below the rock ( upper left and lower right in this context image )			0
@entity89 can do focus merging onboard			0
the full - frame versions of the eight separate images that were combined into this view were not even returned to @entity8 - just the thumbnail versions merging the images onboard reduces the volume of data that needs to be downlinked to @entity8 .			0

@entity144 *consults* on different ways to bring soil back to @entity8
@entity4 may decide on the best plan next year - *balancing* scientific curiosity against mission cost
meanwhile , @entity88 brings us new close - ups from the @entity2
