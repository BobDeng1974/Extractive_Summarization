by @entity0 in an age when many have willingly surrendered all pretence of style in favour of substance , @entity1 offers a refreshing , intriguing take on what is important in football and what is not			1
asked yesterday if a scrappy , unconvincing performance against @entity13 would be deemed irrelevant by progression via any aggregate score , the @entity11 sat up in his seat as if his ears had been assaulted by a volley of personal insults			1
‘ i will never say that			2
never , ’ he retorted			2
‘ if we win , i will say i am very happy with the result but i will also say if i am not happy with the performance			1
in the game against @entity26 ( a 3 - 1 win in pre-season ) , we were lucky			1
we should have lost that game but we won			2
okay , that sometimes happens , but i ca n’t fool myself or my team			2
pushing for style : @entity1 wants his team to impress as well as win finisher : @entity36 ( right ) celebrates with team - mates after scoring the only goal in the first leg ‘ we could have lost 1 - 0 in @entity41 but that would have been unlucky because we played well and had many more chances than them			1
we won 1 - 0 and we should have won more			1
on tuesday we have the chance to make that better			1
‘ i ’m after a performance and i think we will get a good one tomorrow			2
’ even without @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 , @entity1 has sound reason to believe he will cut a content figure come the close of play			1
his charges were measurably superior to the @entity41 champions a week ago			1
the one - goal margin of victory in no way reflecting the stranglehold they had over the game			1
given the uncertainty surrounding their temporary housing at the home of @entity67 , that was no bad thing			2
an opening night victory was verging on mandatory			2
for all @entity1 and his players were suitably impressed with the hybrid surface they trained on last night , this remains a step into the unknown			1
yet if anyone believes this rather odd scenario of playing a home game in an alien stadium is some kind of ready - made excuse , they are sorely mistaken			1
‘ i have n’t been to @entity82 , so for me this is the first home game , ’ @entity1 added			1
‘ and when i went out there i wanted to play football			2
‘ it ’s a very good pitch , brand new and a lot of people can be here as well , so i think we ’ll have a good support			2
‘ of course , @entity93 fans are different class			1
they are the 12th man and i hope they come and support the team because we need it			2
‘ the players understand how i ’m thinking now , how every training session is important , every game is important and this game is unbelievably important to get through			2
but it ’s also important to get a performance , not just to get through and get a result			0
‘ we want to go out and be better than we were the last time we played because we need progression and we need to use every day to get better			0
‘ if we go through but have played badly then i get angry because we have n’t used the day in a good way and if you play bad you can lose as well			0
‘ then we have big problems			0
i really want to have a good performance and if we do we will entertain the crowd and the fans and also win the game			1
’ missing : striker @entity47 wo n't be playing in the game on tuesday leader : nor will captain @entity48 , pictured here with assistant manager @entity114 shorn of a raft of players tonight , @entity1 finds his squad already stretched but the misfortune of some naturally opens doors for others			1
the @entity11 appears to be a fair man but an extremely demanding one			0
in these early days of his regime , he ’s prepared to cut his players a degree of slack but his patience is n’t boundless either			0
players - such as @entity128 - who have n’t previously impressed in a @entity93 shirt , are being widely encouraged to now make their point			1
you sense they ’d be well advised to take it sooner rather than later			0
‘ @entity133 still has a future at this club , ’ @entity1 added			1
‘ i come in here with an open view			0
‘ everyone has the chance to make a career for themselves here			0
@entity133 has worked hard but i want him to develop more			0
‘ his fitness could be better but i think he is more conscious of what he is doing on the pitch and i ’m looking forward to seeing more of him			0
‘ it ’s important for our strikers to score but i think we have been quite effective in our pre-season games			1
i always like to look behind the results , though , and we have deserved to lose some of those games			1
‘ however , that was not the case in @entity41 , when we should have won by more			1
i think we have strikers who will score goals			0
it ’s not a problem : we just have to feed them with chances			0
‘ we had a lot of big chances in @entity41 and if we keep on playing like that we will score more goals			1
’ @entity162 is another with some making up to do			0
unable to match the mammoth expectations that followed his winning goal against @entity165 in 2012 , he spent last year farmed out to @entity168 side @entity166 in the hope he might mature			1
chance to shine : @entity170 ( left ) will be given the opportunity to impress prize asset : they will be desperate to hold on to the likes of goalkeeper @entity175 so has @entity1 already detected that change to the extent that he might involve him tonight ? ‘ we will see , ’ he replied			1
‘ he has special skills and he has something extra			0
he can score goals - we have seen that in training			2
he is training well now and he looks fitter			0
he has had a little bit of trouble with his thigh			0
he is not ready for 90 minutes but he might get some minutes			0
’ nonetheless , regardless of the impact such fringe players might make in the coming weeks , it seems inconceivable that @entity93 would go into the group stages without further strengthening – should they get there			1
the prospect of a prized asset like @entity199 or @entity175 also departing before august is out can not be discounted so , provided his side do progress , the manager ’s ability to work seamlessly with his club ’s signing model is likely to be given a stern early test			2
‘ the players who are here now are the ones who are going to take us through , ’ @entity1 added			1
‘ maybe we can get two or three in , but the main players are here now			0
nothing revolutionary is going to happen			0
‘ yes , if we sold any of our bigger players , i would expect some of the money to be made available to me			0
that ’s the way the club has been			0
if players go out , we get money to do something else			0
‘ it ’s hard to do it right away , to go in and get your target in an hour or whatever			0
you have to take your time and find the right prospect			0
we have players we have identified and we will see if we can get the ones we want			0

@entity1 wants his side to impress as well as win games
