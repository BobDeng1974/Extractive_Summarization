by @entity0 published : 04:35 est , 19 november 2013 updated : 06:38 est , 19 november 2013 when one mother from @entity3 put her son down for a nap after getting a new puppy , she could n't have imagined what was about to happen			1
and a week after pictures of baby @entity10 curled up to sleep with puppy @entity12 went viral , @entity8 says she ca n't believe how popular the pair have become			1
speaking to @entity15 , the mother - of - three said : ' i 'm completely flabbergasted			0
it 's beyond anything i 've ever dreamed			0
' based on the responses that i 'm getting , it 's the peacfulness and the natural way that they are together			0
it 's sweet and it 's innocent and it 's lovely and people appreciate it and i appreciate it			0
' now ms @entity8 is using her new - found fame to ask people to donate to their local pet rescue home , after she adopted @entity12 - a part @entity49 , part @entity51 - from @entity53			1
that rescue centre is currently appealing for $ 1.5million ( £ 930,000 ) to start work on a new building after already raising $ 3million ( £ 1.8million )			0
make yourself comfortable : the @entity8 family in @entity53 , @entity3 got @entity12 when he was just 7 - weeks - old this month snuggle buddies : while they intended to crate train the puppy , mother @entity8 decided she could n't bear to hear the puppy cry at night the pictures , posted on her blog , have attracted millions of views and thousands of comments since they were posted last thursday			1
she says the nap - time ritual started three days after they took @entity12 , who 23 - month - old @entity10 calls ' bee - bo ' , home with them			1
at first the family had decided to crate train the dog , from a litter of 11 , by making him sleep alone , but his cries were too much for them to bear			0
the dog spent his first night on the sofa with @entity8 's partner , @entity80 , and then the second night sleeping with her			0
but on the third afternoon , as she was rocking baby @entity10 to sleep , @entity12 decided to join in by laying on top of him , and was soon fast asleep too			2
cozy : mother @entity8 says she almost woke the two up the first time they fell asleep for a nap because she was ' practically howling at the cuteness ' cushy : @entity12 finds a place to rest his head in @entity10 's armpit stretched out : each day , @entity12 waits outside the bedroom for nap time and settles in next to @entity10 once the toddler has fallen asleep @entity8 says she nearly woke both of them up after ' practically howling at the cuteness ' but managed not to , and since then the two have been inseparable			1
the most organic and beautiful friendship i have ever witnessed - see more at : @entity100 the most organic and beautiful friendship i have ever witnessed - see more at : @entity100 @entity8 added : ' the following day , @entity12 met us up in my room for the nap time ritual , and so began what i can only describe as the most organic and beautiful friendship i have ever witnessed			2
' every afternoon for the past week the pair have slept side - by - side , and @entity8 says @entity12 now knows when it is time for a nap and waits at the end of the bed			1
she says she has to get @entity10 off to sleep first , otherwise the dog will wake him up , but after he is asleep she puts @entity12 onto the bed who totters over to the sleeping toddler before dropping off himself			2
the duo then sleep intertwined for up to two hours at a time			0
lean on me : the puppy and the toddler share an uncommon bond wrapped up : the two have synched their sleep schedules more to come : mrs @entity8 promises to continue posting nap time pictures on @entity124 under the @entity125			2
