@entity0 had a history of traffic violations - but never violence the killing of a unarmed black great - grandfather by a white police officer who shot him through his car door in the driveway of his own home is causing outrage in @entity11			1
the fury grew again when prosecutors announced earlier this month that a grand jury in had handed down charges against @entity17 public safety officer @entity16 , 25 - but that he faces only a misdemeanor ' misconduct in office			1
' according to police reports , 68 - year - old @entity21 refused to pull over when @entity16 spotted him making a traffic violation in @entity17 on february 9			1
he led @entity16 and other officers on a nine - mile low - speed chase to his home in the next county			1
when @entity0 finally stopped - in his own driveway - craven ran up and fired several shots into the car door , fatally wounding him			2
@entity0 's door was still locked			0
investigators determined that @entity17 public safety officer @entity16 broke the law			1
a prosecutor , in a rare action against a police officer , sought to charge him with voluntary manslaughter , punishable by up to 30 years in prison			1
but the grand jury disagreed , indicting him on a misdemeanor			1
the debate over how police use force against unarmed people has become a national issue since an unarmed 18 - year - old black man was shot to death in august by a white police officer in @entity49 , @entity50 , where unrest still lingers			1
but most police shootings make only local headlines , and just for a day or two			0
the refusal of authorities to release public information about these on - duty actions by taxpayer - paid officials is a big reason why			2
as with many such killings , @entity0 's death in february remains shrouded in mystery			2
@entity64 can make a difference : @entity11 gained the national spotlight last week after a dashboard camera showed how in just a few seconds trooper @entity68 went from asking motorist @entity69 for his license for a supposed seat belt violation , to shooting at him repeatedly without provocation , even as @entity69 put his hands in the air			0
@entity69 was hit once and is recovering			0
state public safety director @entity75 called that shooting ' disturbing , ' and @entity68 was promptly fired and charged with felony assault			0
sometimes , the video can exonerate officers : in august , a @entity11 prosecutor refused to file criminal charges against a @entity82 deputy who wounded a 70 - year - old man after mistaking his cane for a shotgun during an after - dark traffic stop			2
using video , the sheriff showed how the cane 's shaft could be mistaken for a gun barrel in the dim light			0
so far , 35 people were shot by police in @entity11 this year ; 16 were killed			0
the state is on pace to surpass last year 's total of 42 people shot by police			0
in @entity0 's case , prosecutors wo n't say why they sought a felony charge against @entity16 , who chased @entity0 for 9 miles , beyond city limits and into @entity103			1
police initially claimed that @entity0 had gotten out of his car before the shooting - though a police report later revealed that his door was locked when he was shot experts say it 's the first time an officer was charged in a fatal shooting in roughly a decade			1
but the grand jury opted for ' misconduct in office , ' a charge used for sheriffs who make inmates do their personal work , or officers who ask for bribes			1
their single - page indictment , returned in august , contains no details other than accusing @entity16 of ' using excessive force and failing to follow and use proper procedures			1
' black leaders were astonished that an officially unjustified shooting of an unarmed man should merit such a light charge			2
' it diminishes the nature of the violation — of the death			0
this man 's life is only worth a misdemeanor ? ' said state representative @entity136 , a @entity137 who has spent decades speaking out against racism in law enforcement and demanding accountability through data and police cameras			1
@entity136 , who is black , also wants authorities to release evidence more quickly in police - involved shootings			2
authorities often say doing so could taint potential jurors			0
@entity136 says that does n't give people enough credit			0
the @entity152 denied requests filed by @entity154 under the @entity155 to learn what evidence was gathered against @entity16			1
solicitor @entity157 , who is handling the case , did n't return phone calls			0
@entity160 , the @entity161 and @entity16 's lawyer , @entity162 , declined to comment			1
the few details released raised concerns among law enforcement experts			2
in the likely 10 to 15 minutes he trailed @entity0 , @entity16 should have had time to learn he was headed home and had no violent incidents on his criminal record , said @entity171 criminology professor @entity170			1
police records show @entity0 had been arrested more than a dozen times for traffic violations , most of them for driving under suspension or under the influence			0
most of the charges led to convictions			0
he also was charged at least three times for failing to stop as officers tried to pull him over			0
but his record shows no evidence he ever physically fought with an officer			2
@entity103 deputies who joined in the chase reported that @entity16 ran up to @entity0 's parked car and fired several shots into the driver 's side door , telling the other officers that @entity0 tried to grab his gun			1
the other officers could n't get @entity0 's door open , so they broke the passenger side window , unlocked that door and dragged him out			0
' why would he run up to the car like that ? ' asked @entity170			0
' why would he put himself in a situation to use deadly force ? why would he put his gun close enough for him to grab it ? ' @entity0 , who worked for years as a mechanic , liked to fish and was remembered by his family as a laid - back man who kept to himself , left behind six children , 16 grandchildren and five great - grandchildren			2
seven months after the funeral , and eight days after his indictment , @entity16 was put on administrative leave — with pay			1
@entity0 's family then sued the @entity212 , @entity103 and its sheriff 's office			2
the lawsuit alleges @entity16 ignored the @entity103 deputies ' orders to stop and let them manage the chase when it entered their county , about 2 miles from @entity0 's home			1
it claims @entity0 never tried to grab the officer 's gun when @entity16 fired five times , hitting him with four bullets — two in the chest			1
the family says the officers yanked the mortally wounded man out of the car , restrained him and left him on the ground unattended until paramedics arrived			0
their lawyer , @entity233 , hopes to force authorities to release any video and other evidence			0
@entity17 's @entity237 has refused to release any details about @entity16 's history			1
city officials did n't make him available for interviews , and he did n't respond to emails			0
police agencies hurt their own credibility when they withhold information , allowing rumors and speculation to fill the void , @entity170 said			0
' they work for us - the public , ' @entity170 said			2
' you need to put as much accurate information out there as you can to get in front of the issue and create your own story			0

@entity21 , 68 , was gunned down by officer @entity16 after leading a low - speed chase to his home on february 9
prosecutors said @entity16 acted outside the law an convened a grand jury , hoping to charge him with voluntary manslaughter
instead , the grand jury indicted @entity16 on a single count of misdemeanor ' misconduct in office '
