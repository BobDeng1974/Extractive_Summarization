by @entity0 @entity3 suppliers around the world are about to crank up their production lines for the big screen set to find its way into the @entity8 , it has been claimed			1
@entity9 , @entity10 and @entity12 's @entity11 have all been tapped to make the screens			2
they will begin mass producing displays as within weeks for the next @entity8 , expected to be launched this autumn , with a 4.7 - inch screen likely to be produced first while a 5.5 - inch version could be delayed			1
both @entity8 6 screens will be larger than the 4.0 - inch panels on @entity3 's existing @entity33 and 5c models			2
larger iphones , the subject of months of speculation , would mark yet another incremental tweak to the popular smartphone line and an attempt to catch up to rivals like @entity46 ceo @entity48 , while promising only ' new product categories ' for 2014 , has played his cards close to his chest			2
@entity3 's shares have languished below $ 600 since november 2012 , in part because of worries about smartphone market saturation and its ability to stay at the forefront of tech innovation			0
both @entity8 6 screens are expected to use in - cell touch panel technology - built into the screen and allowing for thinner construction than with standard touch panel films - that was introduced with the @entity65 , the sources said			1
but due to difficulties with in - cell production technology for the larger 5.5 - inch size , one of the sources said , a decision was made to begin mass production with the 4.7 - inch version alone			1
production of 5.5 - inch screens is expected to start several months later , with the possibility of a shift to a film sensor instead of in - cell technology for that size , the source said			1
@entity9 will be the first supplier to start production , at its flagship plant at @entity83 , east of @entity84 , as early as may , the sources said			0
the others are due to begin output around june			0
images posted to @entity89 social network @entity88 earlier this week are thought to have been leaked by an anonymous insider working at @entity3 supplier @entity91			0
although the images are blurry , they appear to show a rounded design and a protruding camera , similar to those seen on the @entity97			0
although the images are blurry , they appear to show a rounded design and protruding camera , similar to that seen on the @entity97 @entity3 's @entity106 is rumoured to come in a slim ' @entity108 ' version			1
up until august last year , @entity109 was the record - holder for the thinnest phone in the world with its @entity113 , at 6.18mm			0
this was then replaced by the @entity115 at just 5.75mm			0
by comparison , @entity116 € ™ s current @entity33 has a depth of 7.6mm , while the @entity119 is slightly thinner at 7.5mm			0
@entity46 's @entity120 is 7.9mm thick , while the @entity121 is 9.3mm			0
alternatively , the models shown in the pictures could be the next generation of @entity3 's mp3 player			0
reports are claiming @entity3 is gearing up to go into mass production of the screen on its next flagship phone as early as next month			1
the first image shows what appears to be a blueprint of the @entity8 , while the other two images of prototype models are shown in silver with rounded edges - similar to those seen on last yearâ € ™ s @entity119 tablet			0
speculation is rife that @entity3 could follow up this super-thin tablet with an equally slim phone , dubbed @entity108 , and the new images appear to corroborate this			1
earlier this month , @entity145 magazine @entity144 published drawings of what purported to be a 4.7 - inch and 5.7 - inch @entity148			1
earlier this month , @entity145 magazine @entity144 published drawings of what seemed to be a 4.7 - inch and 5.7 - inch @entity148 , pictured			1
the drawings feature a flat , bezel - free device with rectangle - shaped volume controls like those found on the current @entity156 , as well as a camera with a single led - flash on the rear the drawings feature a flat , bezel - free device with rectangle - shaped volume controls like those found on the current @entity156 , as well as a camera with a single led - flash on the rear			0
recent concept images were then created using the schematics detailed in @entity170 € ™ s release , by designer @entity21 , and @entity23 artists @entity24 and @entity172			0
these concepts feature a curved screen with ' bumps ' at the top and bottom , along with an illuminated @entity31 sensor used to recognise fingerprints , first introduced on the @entity33			1
the protruding camera and rounded edges of the purported @entity8 prototypes are similar to those seen on the current @entity97 model , pictured the latest mockups come after @entity187 sources said the camera in the @entity8 will get a boost to @entity190 , from its current @entity192 version , along with a new lens offering better picture quality			2
it is also expected to boast a new filter , allowing for clearer pictures			2
if @entity3 follows its usual release schedule , the new models will be unveiled in september this year , although experts are expecting the tech giant to launch at least one model in june			2
@entity3 's new devices are expected to use the in - cell touch panel technology - which embeds sensors more tightly into the screen - seen on previous models to make the next device as thin as possible			1
but reports suggest difficulties with this technology in larger displays has caused @entity3 to delay production of the 5.5 - inch versions			0
last november , designer @entity21 created a concept that demonstrated it was possible to increase the screen size of the @entity8 , without drastically increasing the size of the handset			1
in his image , pictured , the screen is stretched to reach left and right edges			2

handset expected to go on sale in september with *updated* @entity226 *software*
rumours of a 4.7 and *5.5inch* screen version
thin version could be called @entity108
