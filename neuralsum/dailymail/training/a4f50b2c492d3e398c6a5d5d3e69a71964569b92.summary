the remains of @entity1 have been a mystery to @entity3 's for 136 years but now scientists say they have uncovered the truth of his burial through a major forensic investigation the missing skull of the infamous @entity3 bushranger , @entity1 , has been a mystery to @entity12 for 136 years			1
it was a question that had been left unanswered until an unidentified skull first emerged in 1979 at the grounds of @entity16 - near where @entity1 was buried			2
scientists were convinced that it belonged to the outlaw who was hanged on november 11 , 1880 at the prison			2
yet the discovery proved too good to be true , after dna testings found that the said skull was not in fact @entity1 's			1
now scientists have revisited the enigma - this time claiming to have uncovered the secrets behind @entity1 's burial and what ultimately became of his skull			2
the major forensic investigation has been documented in the book ' @entity1 : under the microscope ' with answers to the unsolved mysteries of one of @entity12 's most renowned criminals , according to @entity37			1
through a comprehensive scientific analysis the truths behind @entity1 's death and mysterious skull have been revealed by editor @entity42 who collaborated contributions from more than 30 experts			1
mr @entity42 said the investigation answers what became of his skull , a myth that has been argued for over a century			0
' the book explores the science undertaken by researchers at the @entity52 , including identifying skeletal remains , analysing dna samples from @entity1 â€™s blood - soaked possessions and physically matching injuries on bones to known bullet wounds that @entity1 sustained , ' he said			0
the bushranger was hanged on 11 november 1880 at the @entity16 @entity1 's ( pictured , right ) supposed skull ( pictured , left ) was put on display at the @entity16			1
although the skull looked similar to @entity1 's shape head , a @entity63 examination revealed it is actually not his @entity1 was buried at a mass grave in @entity67 , in @entity68 - all but his head the truths behind @entity1 's death and mysterious skull has been revealed through a comprehensive scientific analysis led by editor @entity42 who collaborated contributions from more than 30 experts back when the unearthed skull was believed to be @entity1 's , it was placed on display at the @entity16 but was stolen in 1978			1
eventually that same skull was returned in 2009 by @entity79 , a @entity3 farmer			0
the investigative book published by @entity81 reveals that skull , also known as the ' @entity83 ' , looks similar to @entity1 's head shape but a dna examination revealed that it did not belong to the @entity3 bushranger			1
so who is the owner of this skull ? and where is @entity1 's skull ? these questions still remain			2
@entity1 , who 's had @entity12 debate whether the family man was more of a @entity95 character or a notorious criminal , was buried at a mass grave in @entity67 in @entity68			1
another corrupt identity - @entity98 - was said to be buried close to the bushranger , according to the @entity102 's @entity101			0
@entity98 , believed to be @entity12 's first serial killer , was hanged and buried at the prison in 1892 - 12 years after @entity1 's death			1
forensic odontologist dr @entity106 told the @entity101 that he had a ' hunch that the skull belonged to @entity109 '			0
' his head [ from the mask ] was the right shape to fit the skull and we did several photo - superimpositions of the death masks , ' he said			0
' the only ones that fitted were @entity1 and @entity109			0
' he said because @entity98 was buried near @entity1 , it is possible that the remains ' could have been mixed up '			2
testings are underway to identify whether the skull is of the serial killer 's			0
but while @entity63 samples in 2011 identified the 2008 discovery of bones as @entity1 's , his skull remains lost			2
mr @entity42 told news.com.au there are three theories that attempt to answer the mystery of @entity1 's skull : during an excavation of the @entity16 it was crushed ; it has been buried in secret by a senior member of the catholic clergy ; or it was stolen by @entity137			1
