on a night when the @entity0 exceeded expectations , @entity3 ’s 2 - 0 win in @entity4 stood out as the most impressive result of the lot			1
it sees them top @entity9 with nine points from nine having emerged successful from trips to two of the toughest destinations , including @entity14			1
a visit to @entity16 , two points behind in second , comes next month , but given their performances so far that should not mean any trepidation			2
it is little more than a year since @entity24 embarrassed @entity26 ’s side to burst the bubble created by victory over @entity29 and a draw with @entity31			1
coach @entity32 celebrates @entity3 's second goal against @entity4 with his players @entity36 's @entity35 gave @entity3 the lead against @entity4 @entity16 ( away ) november 14 @entity38 ( home ) march 29 @entity16 ( home ) june 13 but the air is back among this camp made up of the game ’s lesser lights			1
@entity45 , it should be noted , has not featured because of injury			1
here @entity48 details the country causing the biggest surprise in qualifying for @entity52 and the man behind it all			2
@entity54 – a familiar name between the sticks , the 37 - year - old is enjoying a renaissance for club and country			2
the former @entity62 goalkeeper left @entity63 in the summer to join @entity64 in @entity65 and had kept five clean sheets as they sit a point outside the play - offs			1
@entity69 – everyone at @entity71 knows who he is ; a key reason the club gained promotion from @entity76 last season			1
full back , 23 , made his national debut in october 2011 but was only winning his sixth cap against @entity4			1
@entity81 – one of the dressing room leaders at @entity83 , but has lost his place to @entity85 this term			0
a late bloomer , he was at @entity88 until 2006 , before eventually getting his @entity90 chance at @entity91 three years ago			0
@entity92 – veteran of @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , and now @entity99 , the 34 - year - old centre back is a dependable figure in the @entity102 team			0
he has 93 caps and is one half of a defensive duo aged 68			1
experience , is the word			0
@entity109 – the left back has been at @entity95 since signing from @entity110 in 2007 and has a smattering of @entity90 appearances			0
on loan at @entity116 last season , he has yet to play a club game this campaign , leaving him fresh for national exploits			0
@entity3 's @entity120 wins the ball from @entity4 's @entity122 in their @entity9 match @entity124 celebrates scoring @entity3 's second goal against @entity4 @entity126 – now operating in a holding midfield role having played across the backline during a career spent largely at @entity130 and @entity97			1
he signed for @entity83 in the summer on a free having only made 16 appearances for @entity134 and @entity135 last season			0
yet to break into @entity137 ’s side			2
@entity120 – younger brother to @entity45 , the midfielder added grit in @entity4			1
he was at @entity62 for six years but moved to @entity141 in 2011 , before joining @entity142 last summer			1
during his time at @entity144 , was nominated for reserve player of the year by @entity146 alongside @entity147 but was beaten by @entity148			2
@entity149 – a buzzing , attacking midfielder perhaps in the form of his career having been given a freer reign at @entity130 with the departure of @entity156			0
born in @entity158 , he joined @entity96 aged 17 but is best remembered in @entity159 playing for @entity98			0
@entity160 – another from the @entity62 school of education , the player born in @entity135 originally turned out for @entity164 at @entity165 and 17 levels			1
he switched to the @entity3 youth set - up in 2010 , qualifying through family heritage , and now has 20 caps			2
@entity160 plays for @entity171 club @entity134			0
the @entity3 fans who made the trip to @entity4 were rewarded with an important win @entity175 ( left ) and @entity124 ( right ) celebrate their goals and three points after the game @entity35 – another born this side of the @entity182 , the 28 - year - old travelled far before finding his feet at @entity36 , where he is an important player offering dynamism on the wings			1
beginning at hometown club @entity96 , he spent time at @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , and @entity189			2
qualifying through his grandfather , he has always played for @entity3 internationally			0
@entity124 – the totemic striker is on a mean scoring streak for his country			0
he strong finish after a slick breakaway against @entity4 brought him a third goal in three qualifying games			1
he has yet to find the net for @entity200 however , having signed from @entity201 in the summer			0
when @entity98 were demoted to the bottom rung of @entity204 football he went to @entity205 in @entity206 , then to @entity207			0
manager - @entity26 – not to be confused with another @entity209 who brought @entity3 cheer but is now doing his stuff south of the border , this 45 - year - old is a relative coaching unknown			0
his playing career saw him at clubs such as @entity95 , @entity217 , @entity134 and @entity218 – as well as @entity219 across the @entity220 – but managing at @entity221 and @entity222 , where he won back - to - back titles , preceded his chance at the national job .			0

@entity32 's side top group after a third win , this time over @entity4
they have a defender from @entity71 who has only six caps
their results have come without @entity62 defender @entity45
