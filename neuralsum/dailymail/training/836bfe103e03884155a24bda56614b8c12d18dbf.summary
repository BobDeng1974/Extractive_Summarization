an asteroid the size of three double decker buses and travelling at at 33,000 mph came closer to @entity3 than the @entity4 last night			1
at 21:07 gmt ( 16:07 est ) , the asteroid made its closest approach , reaching a distance of less than 217,000 miles ( 350,000 km ) , or nine - tenths of the distance between the moon and @entity3			1
scientists predicted it would avoid a collision with @entity3 , but the 98ft ( 30 metre ) asteroid nevertheless offered spectacular views for anyone with a good telescope in their back garden			2
the orbit of 2014 @entity20			1
the planets are white lines , and the asteroid / comet is a blue line			0
the light blue indicates the portion above the solar system 's plane , known as the ecliptic			0
the dark blue the portion below the ecliptic plane the @entity33 and @entity34 set up a live online event sharing real - time images of the asteroid , named 2014 @entity20			1
the site is now showing a brief gif video of the asteroid as it made its closest approach to @entity3			1
a hundred and two images of the @entity20 were captured back to back , using the @entity45 part of the @entity33 telescope , which tracked the movement of the extraterrestrial object as it made its way across the sky			2
the video can be seen here			0
it follows huge popularity of asteroid 2000 @entity54 last month , with thousands of people stayed up into the early hours in the hope of catching a glimpse of a monster asteroid			1
but just as the huge space rock came close to the planet ’s orbit , the dedicated @entity34 website , which promised a live stream of the event , crashed			2
the hope is the latest sighting will provide better views for those who log on			0
this shows the location of the @entity54 in the night sky on feb. 17 , 2014 during a live skywatching webcast by the online stargazing venture @entity34 ‘ on a practical level , a previously - unknown , undiscovered asteroid seems to hit our planet and cause damage or injury once a century or so , as we witnessed on june 20 , 1908 and february 15 , 2013 , ’ @entity34 astronomer @entity74 said in a statement			1
2014 @entity20 is an @entity83 class asteroid , which means it has an @entity3 - crossing orbit			1
there are currently 240 known @entity86 , but it is believed that there are at least 2000 earth - crossers with diameters of 1 km or larger			0
if it hit @entity3 , an impacting @entity83 asteroid would make a crater about 10 - 20 times its size			2
an asteroid 1 km in size could throw so much dust into the atmosphere that sunlight would be blocked for several years			0
‘ every few centuries , an even more massive asteroid strikes us — fortunately usually impacting in an ocean or wasteland such an @entity103			0
‘ but the on - going threat , and the fact that biosphere - altering events remain a real if small annual possibility , suggests that discovering and tracking all near @entity3 objects , as well as setting up contingency plans for deflecting them on short notice should the need arise , would be a wise use of resources			0

asteroid 's 2014 @entity20 closest approach will be at 21:07 gmt ( 16:07 est )
it is 98ft ( *30m* ) across and will get within 217,000 miles ( 350,000km ) of @entity3
asteroid is travelling at 33,000 mph and is not *expected* to hit the planet
live webcast will be available on @entity34 and the @entity33
