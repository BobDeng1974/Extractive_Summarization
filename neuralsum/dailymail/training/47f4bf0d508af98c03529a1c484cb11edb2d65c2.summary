by @entity0 published : 16:14 est , 29 may 2013 updated : 17:30 est , 29 may 2013 with 17 whiplash accidents in eight years , @entity1 might have been considered the unluckiest motorist in @entity4			1
but after hearing details of a recent compensation claim , a judge decided the 30 - year - old may really be an unscrupulous fraudster riding the ‘ crash for cash ’ bandwagon			2
and in an unprecedented move , judge @entity13 ordered a perjury inquiry into the previous payout bids of the serial claimant and his gang , who may have made thousands of pounds from 23 ‘ bogus ’ accidents			1
@entity21 claims : @entity1 's claims were brought to light when a claim that he was in a car hit by a national express coach ( file picture ) , was challenged by the firm @entity1 and three other people alleged they were in a parked car in march 2011 when it was hit by a @entity26 bus			1
the motorist said he pulled the bus over several miles down the road and told the bemused driver he had damaged his vehicle			0
however , investigations revealed the damage to the car could n’t have been done by the bus and @entity26 decided to challenge the compensation bid in court – a case that brought @entity1 ’s previous claims to light			1
at the hearing at @entity46 , the address given for an orthopaedic surgeon who is said to have signed the driver ’s medical report was revealed to be that of a taxi company			0
@entity1 and his friends were found to be lying			2
judge @entity54 said he ‘ disbelieved the claimant ’s evidence in its entirety ’ and ruled that the bus ‘ accident ’ had never happened			0
the unemployed motorist was ordered to pay £ 15,700 towards the bus firm ’s legal costs			2
at least two other people were in the process of claiming compensation for injuries they said they had suffered in the same incident			0
one of them was @entity1 ’s girlfriend @entity70 , 27 , who has made a total of three accident compensation bids in recent years			1
crash for cash : experts believe about £ 60 of a motorist ¿ s annual car insurance premium pays for losses in the industry caused by fake compensation claims ( file picture ) judge @entity54 also ordered a transcript of the hearing to be sent to the @entity84 with a view to a possible prosecution for perjury in relation to this and all the previous accident claims			1
the judge said the investigation should include @entity1 ’s witnesses in the car , his solicitors and the medical expert			1
he added that he ‘ found it incredible ’ that @entity1 had filed yet another whiplash compensation bid against another party since the bus crash claim			1
the motorist began his compensation requests in september 2003 , sometimes claiming for three separate whiplash accidents a year – there were six bids in total for 2010 - 11			0
precedent : a judge at @entity46 , pictured , ordered a perjury inquiry after @entity1 's previous whiplash claims came to light it is not known whether the @entity84 or the police have begun a perjury investigation , but @entity26 said it was willing to make a criminal complaint			1
@entity116 , solicitor for the bus company , promised to defend against ‘ dishonest claims ’ and ‘ prosecute where necessary ’			0
a @entity26 spokesman said the firm was ‘ delighted ’ with the result of the case , adding : ‘ we always fight claims in which evidence raises serious concerns			1
‘ we hope this will make anyone thinking of making a dishonest claim think again			0
’ the scale of ‘ crash for cash ’ scams is driving up insurance premiums for innocent motorists			0
experts believe about £ 60 of a motorist ’s annual car insurance premium pays for losses in the industry caused by fake compensation claims			2
a gang in @entity145 swindled so much money , car insurance firms raised bills in the area by about £ 100 a year			0
the 60 gang members were all either convicted of the estimated £ 3million fraud or admitted the crime during the past 18 months			0
insurance experts recently told @entity153 that half of all whiplash claims from car crashes – an estimated £ 1billion a year – are fraudulent because symptoms are ‘ too easy to fake ’			2
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0

@entity1 claimed he was in a car hit by a @entity26 coach
his string of other claims came to light when the firm challenged the claim
a judge has now ordered a perjury inquiry into previous payouts made
