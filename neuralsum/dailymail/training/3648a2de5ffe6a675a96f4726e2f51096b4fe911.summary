by @entity0 published : 05:38 est , 10 july 2012 updated : 05:38 est , 10 july 2012 defender ? @entity4 terrorists do not want to destroy @entity6 civilisation - and in fact aim to defend themselves , a provocative study has argued @entity4 terrorists do not want to destroy @entity6 civilisation - and in fact aim to defend themselves , a provocative study has argued			1
the study is certain to cause anger among relatives of victims of extremist groups , which often unleash violent and unprovoked attacks			1
the academics claim , however , that the goals of such groups are broadly ' defensive '			2
the study , which analysed 2,000 propaganda texts from @entity4 and other @entity22 groups says that the group 's goals are ' defensive '			1
the researchers looked at quotes from the @entity27 , and found that the extremists focused on maintaining faith and hope in the face of attacks			2
the researchers claim that simply altering the @entity6 view of @entity36 extremists as would - be ' conquerors ' could help to halt the global conflict			0
notorious verses from the @entity27 were quoted in @entity4 materials far less than the researchers expected			0
the so - called ‘ @entity43 ’ ( 9:5 ) that says ‘ fight and slay the pagans wherever you find them ’ was used only three times			0
how this fits in with the violent attacks unleashed by @entity4 and affiliated groups is unclear			1
the researchers catalogued more than 1,500 quotes from the @entity27 that extremists used to support their arguments , and identified the chapter ( surah ) and verse represented in the quote			2
‘ we were surprised at the very limited use of the sword verse , ’ said @entity58 , a research assistant and one of three co-authors of the study , ‘ how islamist extremists quote the @entity27			1
’ ‘ conventional wisdom says @entity36 are bent on world domination and this verse is the justification			1
we found it to be insignificant , ’ he said			0
‘ these findings challenge the idea of a clash of civilizations , ’ said the study 's lead author @entity70 , a professor of communication in @entity74 's @entity73			0
‘ what extremists are really saying to @entity82 is , ' our communities are under siege and @entity84 will defend us if we have faith and courage			0
if we try to portray them as evil conquerors when their audience sees them as protectors and champions , it damages our credibility and makes our communication less effective , ’ he said			0
other studies have shown in fact that @entity4 - linked militants are 38 times more likely to kill a muslim than a member of another group – hardly the activity of a ‘ competent champion , ’ the @entity74 study states .			2

**controversial** study claims *qur'an* quotes ' prove ' @entity4 are ' defenders '

unclear how this fits with extremists violent and unprovoked attacks
