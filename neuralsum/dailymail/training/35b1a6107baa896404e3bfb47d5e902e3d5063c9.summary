by @entity0 published : 19:57 est , 9 august 2013 updated : 19:57 est , 9 august 2013 a-levels in foreign languages should be made easier so that more students get top grades , the exams watchdog suggested yesterday			1
it said just one in 14 pupils received a * s in some modern languages , compared with one in six for maths			2
one solution would be altering the exam to make top marks more achievable , a spokesman admitted			2
‘ if there ’s something about the design currently that ’s preventing that [ top grades ] then it ’s something we ’d have to look at , ’ he said			1
too difficult : an exam watchdog has called for a-levels in foreign languages to be made easier to ensure that more students get top grades the proposal is likely to be unpopular with @entity25 , who is trying to end grade inflation by making exams more robust			1
end - of - course exams replacing bite - size tests on modular courses is one of the measures being introduced under the @entity34 ’s watch			1
students will also be prevented from taking multiple resits to boost results			0
concerns over foreign languages emerged in @entity41 ’s corporate plan for 2013 - 2016 , released the week before this year ’s a-level results			1
data shows 39.4 per cent of entries for @entity45 a-level last summer were awarded an a or above , with 6.8 per cent getting a *			0
in @entity47 , 36.5 per cent got an a , with 6.8 per cent achieving an a *			0
in @entity50 the figures were 41.4 per cent and 7.9 per cent			0
not a fan : the proposal is likely to be unpopular with @entity25 , who is trying to end grade inflation by making exams more robust but in maths , 43.9 per cent got at least an a and 17.4 per cent received an a *			0
in further maths , more than half were a-grade students and 28.6 per cent of those got the top grade			2
one in ten physics entrants got an a * , with 31.9 per cent getting at least an @entity64 the @entity41 report said there were no plans to ‘ recalibrate ’ a-level standards when the new - style exams are introduced from 2015			1
but it added : ‘ there are two features of performance standards at present that we plan to address			0
‘ first , relatively few a * grades are awarded in modern foreign languages when compared with other subjects with a high proportion of a grades			1
secondly , there are variations in the proportion of a * to a grades awarded at a-level each year in subjects			2
‘ we plan to evaluate ... and to make improvements so that standards are as comparable and consistent as possible			0
’ experts said there were reasons for top grades being harder to come by in some subjects			1
professor @entity94 , of the @entity95 at @entity96 , said : ‘ it is perfectly possible to get full marks in maths or further maths , provided you ’ve got the talent			0
the questions are such that you are working for a particular solution			0
‘ when it comes to foreign languages , there ’s an element of interpretation			1
you can be very good and get an a but you may not have the fluency of a native speaker			0
