click here to read @entity2 's report from @entity3			0
@entity4 has expressed his disbelief at @entity7 's lack of leadership and claims their capitulation at @entity11 is part of a wider problem at the club			1
the former @entity16 central defender watched @entity18 ' side blow a lead at @entity3 on sunday			1
it means @entity7 have now won just two @entity22 games since august and find themselves marooned in the bottom half			1
and @entity4 left no stoned unturned when dissecting the 3 - 1 defeat @entity42			1
' this is more than just a poor start - there 's something wrong			2
something is n't right , ' he said			0
' they are getting bullied out of games			0
last year when they came here we said they were mentally and physically weak			0
same again - nothing 's changed			2
‘ you look at the time and there are no men in the team			0
sometimes you ’ve got to grind results out			0
' @entity60 has gone ... so what ? @entity60 has gone			0
there 's no leadership on the pitch			2
as a @entity7 fan , which i am - i do n't care about being neutral on tv - when you 're watching your own team , the worst thing you can ever think is they 're being bullied and weak			1
' that 's what we 've seen today from @entity7 and it 's not the first time			1
it 's been going on all season and we 're saying , " oh , new players getting time to adjust			2
" i 'm not a big believer in that			0
@entity83 ( right ) steps up to deliver the killer blow to @entity7 as the visitors lost 3 - 1 against @entity11 @entity26 was criticised by @entity4 for his handling of @entity87 late in the game ' i 've never moved clubs and i 'm sure as a foreign player it takes a bit of time , but we 're getting to the stage now where you want to start seeing performances			1
' @entity7 are n't getting beat by quality - they 're getting bullied			1
they 've been beaten by enthusiasm there by @entity11			1
' you knew it was coming			0
as soon as that goal went in @entity7 did n't offer anything			1
' we had that last season and it cost @entity7 the league			1
they conceded 50 goals last season and it has n't been rectified			2
i 'm very worried as a @entity7 fan			2
' you 're already looking at players and thinking @entity7 need four or five players			2
' @entity4 was also disappointed at the way in which @entity26 hauled down @entity31 in the build - up to the decisive third goal			1
‘ i played alongside @entity26 for a long time and he was doing that from day one , ' he added			0
' @entity26 should n’t be grabbing shirts			0
he ’s actually known for it now throughout the league with the referees			0
‘ i think he ’ll continue to do it until the day he retires			0
