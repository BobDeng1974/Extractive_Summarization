by @entity1 reporter published : 06:18 est , 18 april 2012 updated : 06:18 est , 18 april 2012 a woman with a rare condition that means she collapses every time she laughs fears she may have passed the rare illness onto her young son			2
@entity9 can not visit a comedy show or even go to the pub with her friends as every time she laughs , she collapses in a literal fit of giggles			1
she suffers from a rare neurological condition called cataplexy which means her body goes into a state of total paralysis in response to strong emotions such as amusement , surprise , anger and even love			1
inherited ? @entity9 has both cataplexy and narcolepsy ( right )			1
her younger son @entity28 is undergoing tests after experiencing a fit a few weeks ago just gazing in motherly admiration at her two young children @entity33 , five , and @entity28 , two , brings on an attack leaving @entity9 totally unable to move or speak			1
often , she finds herself collapsed in a heap on the floor having injured herself on the way down and once she nearly suffocated after landing face - down on the sofa			2
she suffers up to 20 cataplexy attacks a day and has to have her mother or brother around her all the time in case she collapses			1
she also suffers from the related condition narcolepsy which means she randomly falls asleep throughout the day , no matter what she is doing			2
limits : @entity9 can never have a bath alone as she could have an attack and drown @entity9 , 25 , from @entity49 , @entity50 , said : ' i 've lost count of the number of times i 've fallen asleep face down in my dinner			1
i ca n't even go to a restaurant with my boyfriend in case i nod off at the table			2
' once i had an attack of cataplexy in the supermarket and then another and another			1
i must have had about 20 in a row and i think people must have thought i was drugged or drunk			2
every time i stood up , i collapsed again			2
' when i have an attack , i can see and hear but i ca n't move or communicate at all			1
it can last a few seconds or it can last for an hour			1
' the worst times are when there is no one around			2
i might be laid on the floor , completely paralysed and the boys will be pulling all the food out of the cupboards and there 's nothing i can do			1
that 's why i do n't like to be left alone with the boys in case anything happens to me or them			2
' @entity9 first noticed the narcolepsy when she was 16 and would fall asleep suddenly in front of the television or while sat on the sofa , even after a long night 's sleep			1
her condition worsened over time until the point where she never knew where she might nod @entity88 said : ' i would be in the middle of eating my dinner and i would just fall asleep or i would fall asleep in the bath			2
' i used to work on a dunking doughnuts kiosk as a teenager and once i fell asleep while i was frothing some milk for a cappuccino , which is impressive when you think of the noise those machines make			2
i just fell asleep standing up and i was lucky i did n't burn myself on it			0
' eventually i saw a consultant who diagnosed me with narcolepsy and gave me some medication			0
' then , at the age of 19 , she fell pregnant with @entity33 and everything changed			0
suddenly , @entity9 would find herself going limp and heavy while she was holding her new baby			1
her head would become heavy and loll to one side and her arms would flop to her sides			0
she said : ' i would have to call to my mum to come quickly and grab @entity33 off me in case i dropped him			0
' i would just be looking at him and thinking how much i loved him and then all of a sudden my arms would go floppy			0
' i was really worried because i was terrified of hurting him			0
' over time , @entity9 found her attacks were becoming more frequent and more severe , causing her to become completely paralysed and unable to speak whenever she had one			1
in 2007 , she was officially diagnosed with cataplexy			0
while cataplexy is extremely rare , 70 per cent of sufferers also suffer from narcolepsy			0
in addition , @entity9 also suffers from poor short term memory and often forgets what she did the previous day			1
@entity9 found her attacks got worse after having @entity28 ( left ) and @entity33 @entity9 said : ' i often panic when i 'm going into an attack and i 'm always hurting myself			1
one time i landed on the sofa on my nose and i could n't move my head in order to breathe			0
the cushion was pushed up against my face and i thought i was going to suffocate			0
' my boyfriend was asleep on the sofa and i could n't even make a sound to alert him to what had happened			0
' it felt like it lasted for ages although it was probably less than a minute and then the attack started to ease off so i was able to move my neck just enough to breathe			1
at times like that the attacks can feel like forever			1
' another time i went down and hit the doctor 's desk while i was in the middle of talking to her			0
she did n't even realise what was happening until it was too late and i had smacked my head on the edge			0
' like many epileptics , @entity9 needs constant supervision and can not drive or even take a bath on her own			1
however , she can suffer up to 20 attacks a day and is not entitled to extra support for her condition			1
now she is worried she may have passed the condition onto her son @entity28 , who suffered a fit in a supermarket two weeks ago			0
he is currently awaiting tests to see if he has inherited either of his mother 's rare conditions			0
she said : ' i 'd hate for @entity28 to have it as it affects every aspect of my life			0
' i 'd love to be able to go for a drink and have a laugh with my friends , but i ca n't			0
as soon as someone cracked a joke i would be paralysed on my barstool and it would be mortifying			1
' i 'm trying some new medication at the moment and i 'm waiting to see how that goes			0
with any luck it will help my condition and i might even be able to go to a comedy club someday			0

during an attack @entity9 can see and hear but her body is *temporarily* paralysed
attacks can last anything from a few seconds to an hour
