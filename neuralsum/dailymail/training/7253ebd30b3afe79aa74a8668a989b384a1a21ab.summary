@entity0 has revealed the design chosen for its next generation spacesuits by a public vote - and a sci - fi inspired ' @entity6 ' design has won			0
this design now will be incorporated into the final version of the suit , which is expected to be ready for testing by november 2014			1
each iteration of the suit will test new technologies that one day will be used in a suit worn by the first humans to step foot on the @entity17			1
each iteration of the suit will test new technologies that one day will be used in a suit worn by the first humans to step foot on the @entity17			1
the public was given three choices of suit design : the @entity29 suit was inspired by the ocean and has been designed to mirror ‘ the bioluminescent qualities of aquatic creatures found at incredible depths , and the scaly skin of fish and reptiles found across the globe			2
’ the technology suit ‘ pays homage to spacesuit achievements of the past while incorporating subtle elements of the future ’			1
it is fitted with @entity46 wire and patches that emit light to make it easier to identify crew members during spacewalks , for example			0
the trends in @entity55 suit is ‘ reflective of what every day clothes may look like in the not too distant future			2
’ it uses electroluminescent wire and a bright colour scheme to mimic the look of sportswear and wearable tech. with 233,431 votes , the ' technology ' option has won @entity0 's z - 2 spacesuit design challenge with just over 63 % of the total vote			0
@entity0 ’s @entity70 is the latest prototype in the agency ’s z range of spacesuits , and will be the successor to the its green and white @entity76 model unveiled in 2012			1
the technology suit , the eventual winner , ‘ pays homage to spacesuit achievements of the past while incorporating subtle elements of the future ’			1
it is fitted with @entity46 wire , and patches that emit light to make it easier to identify crew members during spacewalks , for examples			0
these patches are fitted to the upper and lower torso , alongside collapsing pleats that make movement easier			0
it also has abrasion resistant panels on the lower torso			0

the @entity29 suit was inspired by the ocean and has been designed to mirror ‘ the bioluminescent qualities of aquatic creatures found at incredible depths , and the scaly skin of fish and reptiles found across the globe			2
’ @entity0 said the design reflects the qualities that protect some of ' @entity111 's toughest creatures ' , and specifically includes segmented pleats at the shoulder , elbow , hip and knee			0
it also features electroluminescent wire across the upper torso , which lights up in the dark			0
@entity119 in @entity6 : @entity6 , the film believed to have inspired the design the technology model of the suit , pictured left , ‘ pays homage to spacesuit achievements of the past while incorporating subtle elements of the future			1
' it is fitted with @entity46 wire and patches that emit light to make it easier to identify crew members during spacewalks , for example besides the typical fit checks and mobility evaluations , @entity0 currently is planning a very comprehensive test campaign for the z - 2 suit			0
engineers will conduct multiple vacuum chamber tests , including one series at full vacuum , mimicking the lack of atmosphere found in space			2
the suit will be tested at @entity0 's @entity150 in @entity151 in the @entity152 , the huge indoor pool used to train astronauts to spacewalk			1
further testing at a site at @entity150 that imitates the rocky @entity17 surface will help evaluate the suit 's mobility , comfort and performance			1
ultimately , all of these tests will guide engineers in designing the @entity163			0
with the @entity164 , @entity0 will employ cover layer design elements , like electroluminescent wiring , never used before in a spacesuit			0
meanwhile , the @entity55 suit is ‘ reflective of what every day clothes may look like in the not too distant future			2
’ it uses electroluminescent wire and a bright colour scheme to mimic the look of sportswear and wearable tech. the design includes pleats with contrast stitching , plus electroluminescent wire and patches of varying styles across both the upper and lower torso			0
the @entity70 will be made using 3d printed parts , while 3d human laser scans will be used to accurately size each suit to individual astronauts			1
in a blog post , @entity0 said : ‘ as spacesuit engineers , [ we ] have found ourselves with an exciting opportunity : the chance to make a suit with a look unlike any suit ever built before			2
‘ the designs were created with the intent to protect the suit and to highlight certain mobility features to aid suit testing			2
‘ to take it a step further , we are leaving it up you , the public , to choose which of three candidates will be built			0
’ the z - 2 , technology prototype pictured , will be made using 3d printed parts , while 3d human laser scans will be used to accurately size each suit to the astronaut			1

’ it features electroluminescent wire , pictured right , on the upper torso that lights up in the dark despite claims it looked like a toy suit , @entity0 's @entity76 suit , pictured , was named one of @entity238 's @entity237 of 2012 @entity0 will now put the winning design into production before running it through tests at the @entity150 in @entity151			1
technically , the @entity164 will be built to withstand and absorb impact , especially on the upper and lower torso			0
despite claims it looked like a toy suit , @entity0 ’s @entity76 suit was named one of @entity238 's @entity247			1
‘ after the positive response to the @entity76 suit 's visual design we received , we wanted to take the opportunity to provide this new suit with an equally memorable appearance , ’ continued @entity0			1
‘ the cover layer of a prototype suit is important as it serves to protect the suit against abrasion and snags during the rigors of testing			1
‘ with the @entity70 , we 're looking forward to employing cover layer design elements never used in a spacesuit before			1
‘ the designs were produced in collaboration with suit vendor @entity266 , and @entity268			2
@entity0 's @entity70 is the latest prototype in the agency 's z range of spacesuits , and will be the successor to the @entity76 model unveiled in 2012			1
@entity0 has created three designs calls @entity29 , pictured , @entity275 and is asking the public to vote for their favourite the designs were produced in collaboration with suit vendor @entity266 , and @entity268			0
the @entity282 prototype is pictured the last time @entity0 redesigned its astronauts spacesuits , the result looked like it had been inspired by @entity286 star @entity285			1
for its next model , @entity0 is putting the decision - making process out to a public vote , and is asking people to choose from three protoypes			0
called @entity29 , @entity275 , and @entity293 the three suits have been inspired by nature , advances in space technology and how the agency thinks clothes of the future will look			2
the @entity55 suit , pictured , is ' reflective of what every day clothes may look like in the not too distant future			0
' it uses electroluminescent wire and a bright colour scheme to mimic the look of sportswear and wearable tech			0

suit is the successor to the space agency ’s ‘ @entity285 ’ @entity76 model
the @entity70 will be made using 3d printed parts , while 3d human laser scans will be used to accurately size each suit to the astronaut
will go through tests at the @entity150 in @entity151
elements of prototype suit expected to be used in @entity17 *spaceasuit*
