some parents shopping for health insurance through the new federal marketplace are running into trouble when their children might be eligible for @entity5 but they are not			1
children who qualify for @entity5 , the safety - net program for the poor and disabled , ca n't be included on subsidized family plans purchased through the federal marketplace , a fact that is taking many parents by surprise and causing confusion and problems for others			1
a @entity17 man says he was given false assurances that his children could be covered by the same plan he picked for his wife and himself , and a @entity23 father says his daughter is going without coverage while he waits for answers			1
in @entity29 , some parents who 've enrolled in private plans for themselves are finding out later that their children are n't eligible for @entity5 after all , leaving the kids with no options			1
flawed : across the country , children are being denied coverage by @entity35 , signed into law in 2010 , if they qualify for @entity5 ' the children are getting stuck in this spot where we 've enrolled the parent , but we ca n't bring the children back on the family plan , ' @entity37 , senior legal counsel for @entity38 of @entity29 , told a state advisory board panel this month			1
the federal @entity46 declined to say how the system is supposed to work for families and what problems have emerged			2
but a regional manager for @entity46 acknowledged the problem at the same @entity29 meeting and said the agency is working on it , as did @entity37 in a later interview			0
' this is an important issue , and we 're not taking it lightly , ' she said			0
' even if this impacts only one family ... it 's a big deal and we want to get it resolved as quickly as possible			0
' the federal government sets minimum guidelines for @entity5 eligibility , but states can choose to expand coverage beyond that			1
in some states , parents must have significantly lower incomes to gain @entity5 coverage for themselves than they would to get coverage for just their children , either through @entity5 or the @entity74 - also known as @entity74 - the low - income health insurance program for children who do n't qualify for @entity5			1
in @entity78 , @entity23 , @entity77 was thrilled to find a better , cheaper family plan through the new marketplace , then stunned to realize his 14 - year - old daughter would n't be enrolled because she might qualify for @entity82 , the state 's version of @entity74			1
the federal government still has n't transferred roughly 90,000 @entity5 files over to @entity23 officials , including @entity77 's daughter 's , so she still does n't have insurance			1
denied : @entity90 relies on @entity5 , but her home state of @entity92 wo n't expand the program under @entity35 ' based on your income , they 'll separate your kids from your primary policy and they shift them off to @entity5 or @entity82 and there 's no way you can bring them back , ' said @entity77 , 53 , who runs a restaurant franchise			1
his daughter is an accomplished equestrian jumper who competes around the state			0
' i 'm kind of in limbo with her because i 'm just hoping she does n't get injured or sick , ' he said			0
' without insurance , you 've kind of got a knot in your stomach watching her jumping			0
' insurance broker @entity117 in @entity119 , @entity23 , said he has about 15 clients in @entity77 's position			0
' i have worried parents literally calling and texting me every day asking for an update , ' said @entity117			0
' they canceled their old plans that covered their entire family and now they have coverage but their kids do n't			1
' @entity129 of the @entity130 said her group has raised the problem , and others , with federal officials and asked for a dedicated hotline or email address for insurance brokers to get answers			1
' it 's a nationwide issue that we 've heard time and again , and it could have very significant coverage issues for families , ' she said			0
@entity144 , a construction consultant in southern @entity29 , said the process has been so confusing , he 's put off a decision for himself , his wife and their two children , even though he 's seen premiums that are significantly lower than what they pay now			1
unpopular : according to a recent poll , only 38 percent of @entity153 approve of @entity35 ' we 've been hesitating for two months now because the information is not clear , ' he said			0
' around the holidays , we were thinking , " let 's do this , let 's sign up , ' " and then the latest problem is now our children will probably be thrown into the state health care system , but nobody knows what that means			2
' @entity168 , associate commissioner of the @entity29 @entity169 , urged those awaiting @entity5 decisions to call their state offices directly			2
she said her office has been getting incomplete application information from the federal government , making it harder to contact people to determine their @entity5 eligibility , but situations are improving and the office is reaching out to hundreds of people each day			1
' there 's a real light at the end of the tunnel , ' she said			0
but in the meantime , children are going without coverage			2
in @entity17 , @entity190 said when he applied by phone through the covered @entity17 marketplace , he was assured that his two children would be on the plan he picked			2
but he later got separate notices from the insurance company and @entity197 , the state 's medicaid program			0
he called covered @entity17 again and was told the person he 'd previously talked to there was wrong and that his children had to be enrolled in @entity203 , the president of a @entity206 technology company , does n't like that prospect because the doctors his children have seen since their births do n't take @entity5			1
' it 's pretty frustrating , ' he said			0
' we 've probably spent several days ' worth of time on hold			0
' instead , he 's exploring whether he can enroll his children in individual , unsubsidized plans through covered @entity17			2
he recently found out his original application was " hung up , " so he plans to resubmit a fresh application , but in the meantime has lost out on coverage for january			2
' my daughter is in gymnastics , ' he said			0
' if she falls on her head , we need to be covered			0

children who qualify for @entity5 ca n't be included on subsidized family plans purchased through the federal marketplace
parents must have significantly lower incomes to gain @entity5 coverage for themselves than they would to get coverage for just their children
until the problem is figured out , thousands of children do n't have coverage
