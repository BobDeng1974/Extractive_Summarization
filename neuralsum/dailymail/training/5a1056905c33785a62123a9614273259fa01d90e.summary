a @entity2 diet does little for the brain and wo n’t prevent dementia , researchers claim			1
@entity6 scientists say there is no evidence that eating plenty of fruit , vegetables and oily fish boosts concentration in old age			1
inspired by traditional eating habits in @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 , the diet has been shown to prevent heart disease and cancer as well as increase life expectancy			2
@entity6 researchers say there is no evidence that a @entity2 diet boosts memory or concentration in old age and recently a number of studies have implied it may be just as beneficial for the brain and could stave off @entity32			1
some scientists believe that because the diet is low in saturated fat , it prevents the blood vessels that supply the brain becoming blocked			1
but academics from @entity40 say there is no evidence for such a link			0
the researchers tracked the diets of 3,000 middle - aged adults for more than a decade and divided them into three groups depending on how ‘ @entity2 ’ their diet was			0
when the adults were 65 and over , they took six tests which checked their concentration and memory			0
it has been suggested that the ' good ' fats from foods such as oily fish might benefit the brain directly the results , published in the @entity59 , found no difference between the scores of the three groups			1
lead researcher @entity63 said : ‘ midlife adherence to a @entity65 was not associated with global cognitive performance [ brain power assessed 13 years later ]			0
’ furthermore the researchers said that recent work by other scientists had also failed to find any link			0
last year , the @entity72 in @entity73 found women over 65 who followed a @entity2 diet did not perform any better in memory tests			0
however , professor @entity77 , from the @entity78 in @entity79 , said there was not yet enough evidence to draw firm conclusions about the diet ’s effect on the brain .			2

no evidence that eating plenty of fruit , veg and oily fish boosts concentration in old age , say @entity6 experts
until now , theory has been that diet prevents the blood vessels that supply the brain becoming blocked
