by @entity1 reporter published : 12:07 est , 9 january 2014 updated : 12:08 est , 9 january 2014 a @entity4 chef opened a new restaurant in @entity6 - only to then ban any @entity6 from eating there			1
@entity9 's restaurant specialises in traditional @entity4 cuisine with coarse - grained pork sausages , blood pudding and fine wine on his menu			1
@entity9 , who moved to the country in 2005 , wanted his restaurant to exclusively serve expats wanting to eat non-halal meat and to drink alcohol			2
but his small bistro ' @entity21 ' in @entity6 ’s capital @entity23 was shut down by police after he banned any @entity6 from coming in unless joined by a foreigner			1
raid : @entity9 's restaurant @entity21 in @entity23 has been shut down by police after he refused to let @entity6 dine in his restaurant unless accompanied by a foreigner he was raided by police after @entity31 , a prominent @entity6 journalist , complained his restaurant was refusing reservations from anyone except ' foreign - passport holders '			1
after being refused a table , @entity31 turned to social media , launching a campaign with the hashtag ' @entity38 '			0
@entity31 said : ' it is so obviously offensive and obnoxious ... why should a private individual establish a club or an establishment which blocks out the very people of the country it is operating in ? ' he published the address of ' @entity21 ' online and then contacted the police , the @entity48 and the local member of parliament			0
two senior police officials then tried to book a table at the restaurant , which is decorated with ornate carpets and works of art , but they too were refused a table			0
@entity9 claims he only barred @entity6 from his restaurant because the law prohibits the sale of alcohol to @entity61 but not to ' non-muslim foreigners ' officers then raided @entity64 , arrested two local staff and confiscated some 300 bottles of wine , beer and even @entity69 — possibly thinking the sparkling mineral water was champagne - before shutting the restaurant down			1
@entity9 claims he felt he had no choice but to refuse locals entry to his restaurant because serving alcohol to @entity61 is illegal			1
former socialist prime minister @entity77 banned alcohol in 1977 , bowing to pressure from @entity81 parties			2
but authorities allow its sale to non-muslims , primarily for festive purposes , and ' non-muslim foreigners '			0
' all that i have done was to abide by @entity6 law			2
if i did something illegal , i would have been condemned by mullahs and visited by the police [ earlier ] , ' says @entity9 , who was previously a chef in @entity4 and moved to @entity6 to work as a firework technician			1
in the diplomatic enclave , a high - security area of the capital which houses most foreign embassies , private restaurants and clubs sell alcohol to foreigners and their @entity6 guests			2
many prominent @entity6 were left outraged by @entity9 's stance - calling it offensive and obnoxious the same goes for major hotels around the country , where foreigners pay handsomely for beer that might come served in a teapot or coffee cup to allay suspicions			1
some posh restaurants operate a ' bring your own booze ' rule as long as customers are discreet			0
even those who obtain licences are sometimes forced to close for days at a time by the police , who are believed to run extortion rackets			0
after the raid , which happened on saturday , @entity9 was able to retake possession of his establishment			2
confident he is in the right , he awaits the release of his two employees and the return of his stock , and hopes to re-open his restaurant — this time by registering it as a ' private club '			0
@entity31 says he does n’t have a problem with a private club , but says nationality should not be a reason to refuse someone membership			0
' having a membership criteria does not mean you can exclude people on the basis of nationality , ' he says .			0

@entity9 's bistro @entity64 serves @entity4 *specialties* and wine

police raided the bistro , arrested two staff members and confiscated some 300 bottles of wine , beer and even @entity69 before closing it down
