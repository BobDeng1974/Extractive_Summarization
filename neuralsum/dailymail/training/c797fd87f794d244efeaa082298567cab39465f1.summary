@entity9 was originally one of the doctors funded by the @entity149 established 100 years ago			1
this transformed rural health provision 35 years before the establishment of the @entity153			2
before the @entity149 there had been concern about the state of medical provision in the @entity158			0
there were reports of poultry buried as treatment for neurological conditions , uncertified deaths , do - it - yourself child delivery ; and a handful of doctors and nurses to cover vast areas of the country			0
when doctors did arrive they did not stay long			0
the island of @entity174 in @entity175 had 13 doctors between 1895 and 1914			2

‘ he delivered many children born on the island and had a formidable reputation as an obstetrician			1
‘ he was responsible for the first air ambulance flight to the @entity14 in the 1930s when he arranged for an aircraft to take a patient to @entity231 who was too infirm to travel by land and sea home to @entity235 in @entity236			0
‘ that patient was my great uncle , reverend @entity230 , and the flight is commemorated in a memorial cairn beside the one to be unveiled to the @entity239			0
‘ all the @entity78 understood the true meaning of service and of supporting communities as well as individuals , something we are having to rediscover today in general practice as we try to integrate health and social care in @entity7			2
‘ they exemplified throughout their professional lives , the spirit of the motto of @entity56 , cum scientia caritas , or science with compassion			0

they were definitely role models for me			0
’ mrs @entity270 added : ‘ my father - in - law would travel out to the surrounding islands on horse or by boat			0
the horse was not even his but the owners let him take it whenever he wanted and he would have to wait for the tide to go out before riding out			0
‘ sometimes he an appointment went on longer than anticipated he would have to wait until the tide went back out so he could ride back to @entity13			1
patience is a virtue when you live on an island			0
‘ the gps on @entity13 always considered the district nurses as a vital part of the " team "			2
often they were called before the doctor and especially before there were phones in the island			0
