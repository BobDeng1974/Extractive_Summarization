overall police handed out almost 400,000 fixed penalty notices for speeding and 73,944 court summons last year , equating to motorists paying out £ 22 million in fines			0
this figure excludes those who took a speed awareness course to avoid paying a fine or receiving points			0
most drivers who were caught speeding said they were spotted by one of @entity2 ’s estimated 3,353 fixed speed cameras ( 58 per cent ) , with a significant proportion caught by police with a camera at the roadside ( 28 per cent ) or police without a camera ( 12 per cent )			1
on an average day , it is estimated that there is now a fixed or mobile camera in operation for every 67 miles of @entity2 road			0
since 2009 , one in seven motorists ( 14 per cent ) have been caught speeding and 22 per cent of these have been caught more than once			0

a speed camera in @entity70			0
it is estimated the camera has been responsible for £ 250k of fines , the bus lane cameras is reported to have issued 6,259 fines in 10 months it would seem that one in six drivers ( 15 per cent ) were caught out by recent changes to local speed limits , with a further one in five ( 19 per cent ) saying that the speed limit was not clearly displayed so they were unsure what it was at the time they were caught			1

among those drivers caught speeding more than once , nearly half ( 43 per cent ) were caught speeding in the same location on more than one occasion			0
many of these drivers believe that the location of this speed camera is unfair as the speed limit has recently changed at that location ( 21 per cent ) or that the speed limit changes too abruptly ( 18 per cent )			2
@entity102 , managing director of @entity25 = car insurance , said : ' it can be easy for motorists to become complacent when they get behind the wheel , especially when they drive on the same roads day in and day out			0
' however , it 's important that drivers always concentrate on the road so they can spot any new road signs , changes in speed limits , and are aware of what other motorists are doing			2
