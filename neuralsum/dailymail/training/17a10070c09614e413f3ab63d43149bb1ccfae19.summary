the official @entity0 has been accused of using ‘ @entity4 tactics ’ to harass thousands of graduates who are behind on their repayments			1
it has invented a fictional firm – @entity7 and @entity8 – which adopts the same threatening language as private debt firms and solicitors to chase payments			1
the tactic appears similar to an approach taken by the payday lender @entity4 , which was last week ordered to pay £ 2.6million in compensation after sending letters to thousands of customers from made - up debt recovery firms			2
the @entity0 is a subsidiary of the government and reports to @entity22 's @entity23 both sets of revelations have triggered calls for a police inquiry into what appears to be evidence of mis - representation and harassment			1
warnings sent by ‘ @entity7 and @entity0 ’ to graduates for the last nine years carry a banner in red stating ‘ @entity36 ’ , with a demand for payment within seven days and a threat of legal action			1
they gave the impression of a separate company with the line : ‘ we are instructed by our client , in connection with the sum outstanding shown above			0
’ but the supposed firm does not exist and is little more than a masthead designed to intimidate			2
the @entity0 ( @entity0 ) is a subsidiary of the government and reports to @entity22 ’s @entity23			1
threat : an extract from the letter sent to graduates the firm said it introduced @entity7 as a ‘ cost - saving exercise ’ because the use of conventional debt collection agencies required payment of commission			1
last week @entity64 watchdog the @entity62 ( @entity62 ) revealed @entity4 would have to pay £ 2.6million compensation to 45,000 people sent letters from two invented debt recovery firms			0
subsequently , @entity64 said it would investigate whether the lender and its millionaire founders had committed any criminal offences under a number of possible headings			0
these range from the @entity75 – which states it is a crime to dishonestly make a false representation intending to make a gain or cause loss to another – and the @entity81 , which protects those in debt from harassment			0
there are also possible offences under the @entity87 of 1974 , which makes it an offence for someone to falsely imply they are a solicitor , and sections of the @entity93 which cover demanding money with menaces			0
consumer groups and lawyers say any evidence a government firm is adopting the same tactics at @entity4 should mean it is also brought into the police investigation			1
the @entity0 has been sending out warning letters under the @entity7 name since at least 2005 , suggesting tens of thousands will have been issued , not least because the number of former students who are in arrears is rising sharply			1
the bullying approach was backed up in @entity7 ’s training manual which told staff that if people refused to pay ‘ then the threat of legal action should be used ’ , including seeking a @entity114			0
it advised : ‘ the threat of a @entity117 should also be used , explaining that someone could actually call round to speak to them personally			0
’ the total amount owed by all students ballooned to £ 54.4billion in 2013/14 following the introduction of £ 9,000 - a - year tuition fees in 2012			0
at the same time , the arrears soared from £ 12.7million to £ 38.2million			0
last week @entity64 watchdog the @entity62 revealed @entity4 would have to pay £ 2.6million compensation to 45,000 people sent letters from two invented debt recovery firms last night @entity130 , founder of the @entity131 , said : ‘ when we find that @entity4 tactics are being used by a lender which is so close to government … it shows very clearly how out of control the lending industry really is			1
we can only hope that the @entity0 faces a criminal investigation as well			2
’ yesterday , the @entity0 said newer @entity7 letters no longer refer to the @entity0 as the ‘ client ’ , adding : ‘ @entity7 is a trading name for the @entity0 and this is made clear on all relevant correspondence to customers			2
our communications were agreed with the @entity147			0
