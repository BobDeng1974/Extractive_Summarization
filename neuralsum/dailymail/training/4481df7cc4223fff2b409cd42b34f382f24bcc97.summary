the cross-border violence , started by @entity3 's killing of a top militant leader on friday , has been the worst exchange of fire between @entity3 and the @entity15 - ruled territory in months			1
the fighting so far has killed 21 @entity17 , including 18 militants , seriously wounded two israelis , and disrupted the lives of a million @entity3 living within the range of @entity6 rockets			1
protection : @entity3 launches a missile from its @entity24 in response to a rocket strike from the nearby @entity8 @entity6 rubble : these homes in the @entity6 are shadows of their former selves after the @entity3 airstrikes destroyed : @entity8 inspect the rubble of a building following an @entity3 air strike in @entity33 today and @entity3 claimed the damage could have been even worse were it not for its newly introduced @entity24 missile defence system			2

the @entity3 military said it carried out nine air attacks against rocket - launching sites and a weapons storage facility today			2
@entity43 said two of its militants were killed in two separate raids , one while he was riding a motorcycle			0
injured : @entity8 medics wheel a wounded man to the treatment room of @entity51 following an @entity3 air strike in @entity53 today talks : @entity43 militants during a press conference in @entity53 today following the strikes blood on his hands : a wounded @entity8 at a hospital in @entity61 in the northern @entity6 today a 16 - year - old boy wearing a school uniform was killed when a group of five civilians was struck in another attack , @entity6 health official @entity62 said			1

chaos : @entity8 medical workers wheel a wounded man for treatment following an @entity3 airstrike this morning wounded : these @entity8 children were injured in the airstrikes today gruesome : @entity87 have been fired by both sides over the last four days schools in the area were closed for a second day to avoid casualties ; a day earlier , a rocket struck the courtyard of one of the empty schools			1
militants also fired three mortar shells into @entity98 , the sole cargo crossing between @entity3 and @entity6 and the conduit for 70 per cent of all goods that enter the @entity8 territory			2
two vehicles were hit on the @entity8 side of the crossing , but there were no injuries			0
operations were halted for about half an hour before resuming			0
but although the violence shows no immediate signs of subsiding , both @entity15 and @entity3 seem eager to avoid the kind of all - out war that erupted three years ago			1
in keeping with its practice since that conflict , @entity15 has stayed out of the current clashes , for fear of provoking a harsh @entity3 retaliation			2
but it has not stopped other , smaller @entity6 factions from attacking @entity3 , and @entity3 continues to hold it ultimately responsible for any violence emanating from @entity6 .			1

cross-border violence began friday when @entity3 killed top militant leader
21 @entity17 dead , two @entity3 seriously wounded
