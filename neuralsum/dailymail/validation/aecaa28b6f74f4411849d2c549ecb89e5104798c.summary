parents who publicly revealed they were traumatised when they were handed the wrong baby by maternity ward nurses after their son was born , have been slammed on social media			1
@entity5 gave birth to baby @entity7 at @entity9 's @entity8 in the inner city @entity11 suburb of @entity13 in january , but was handed another child to hold before nurses noticed the mix - up 45 minutes later			1
she and husband @entity17 revealed her story to @entity19 on tuesday night , but social media has since been flooded with comments accusing mrs @entity5 of overreacting			2
while some commenters have sided with the upset parents of the young boy - who have complained they have struggled to bond with their son who they say is often unsettled - others had harsh words for mrs @entity5			1
it was an honest accident			0
get over it , ' wrote one woman			0
' he was unsettled for 7 weeks after birth ? ! oh my ! that sounds ... like a newborn ' , another posted			0
others told the parents they should ' get some perspective ' and mentioned those who were not so fortunate as to have a healthy child			2
' while this should n't happen and is far from ideal , i do n't think it is the end of the world			0
the babies were n't harmed and were n't left alone			0
sad for the mum , yes			0
i would choose this over my son being still born any day , ' one posted			0
commenters have taken to social media to share their thoughts on the situation many posts have criticised the reaction of the parents one woman wrote that while it was a bad thing that happened , other situations could be worse ' last week all we heard about was a young couple losing their 4 week old bub to whooping cough			2
it happens more than you realise			0
perhaps the reason the child was not settling is because the mother was n't focussing on him , instead of focussing on what she did n't have - a measly 45 minutes			1
get a little perspective ' , another wrote			0
' i just think of all the poor mums who have to wait a week or more to hold their babies because they were born too early or are sick , ' one more posted			0
however some commenters were more sympathetic towards the @entity89 's , agreeing that the first moments with a child are precious , and they were robbed of sharing those with @entity7			2
some have asked the parents to be grateful for the fact they have a healthy happy child quite a few posts related to the fact that the @entity5 family were lucky to have a well little boy but others were much more sympathetic to the experience of the new parents ' some of the comments on here are heartless ... this is a once in a lifetime precious moment			2
she ca n't get that back now			0
that first moment you get to bond with your child is magical , nothing comes close , ' one viewer wrote			0

' i said what 's happened , what 's going on ? ' ms @entity5 told @entity19			2
' and she said , you did n't have @entity7 , you had somebody else 's baby			1
' the two babies had been together in the overnight settling room at @entity9 's @entity8 the error happened despite both infants wearing the correct identification wristbands in the settling room			1
it 's understood that a nurse failed to cross-check the tags and mistakenly brought @entity139 and mrs @entity5 someone else 's child			1
the ceo of @entity9 's @entity8 , @entity143 , confirmed the accidental baby swap and gave the parents affected both a private and public apology on behalf of the hospital and all staff			1

we unreservedly apologise and take full responsibility for the incident , ' he told @entity19			0
he emphasised that throughout the stay the babies were only touched , fed and changed by their parents			0
' while both babies had correct identification name tags attached at all times and both babies remained in their correctly named cots at all times , the staff member did not disturb the parents and check their name bands , ' mr @entity143 said			2
both children were wearing the correct @entity170 wrist bands in the overnight settling room			1
it 's understood that a nurse failed to cross check the wristbands and mistakenly brought the @entity175 someone else 's child ' the second baby remained in the night nursery			1
' when it was realised by staff that there was a baby in the incorrect room , the still sleeping baby was instantly removed from that room and returned to its parents			2
' at no time was either baby picked up , held or fed by anyone other than their parents			0
' the hospital has told the distraught parents that @entity7 remained in the settling room during the 45 minutes period that they were with another infant			1
however , the @entity197 are demanding the truth			0
' i do n't believe that , ' ms @entity5 told @entity19 , unable to hold back tears			0

the ceo of @entity9 's @entity8 , @entity143 , confirmed the accidental baby swap and gave the parents affected both a private and public apology on behalf of the hospital and all staff ' that 's all we 've wanted , to actually see what 's written in the incident report and what actually happened , ' said mr @entity31			1
to make matters worse , the hospital 's attempt to apologise resulted in another embarrassing mix - up			1
mr and mrs @entity5 received a letter of apology and $ 500 worth of vouchers to try and make up for the error			1
however , the hospital sent them the wrong letter			2
they received a package addressed to the other couple involved in the mishap â€“ the parents of the infant they mistakenly had in their care for 45 minutes			1
' i acknowledge that we made an administration error in sending the wrong correspondence to the wrong family , ' mr @entity240 confirmed			0
the @entity197 claim to have been in contact with the parents of the other child and says they have ' also been left traumatised ' the @entity175 say they 've been in contact with the parents of the other child and says they have ' also been left traumatised '			1
the couple insists the incident has had repercussions on their family			0
ms @entity5 says she has had more difficulty bonding with @entity7 than she did with her firstborn			1
their son , now almost three months old , was ' unsettled ' for the first several weeks of his life and did not take to breastfeeding			0
