the @entity2 military ’s @entity0 says they may have a method to stop all infectious diseases - including @entity6			1
by encoding @entity7 and @entity8 in a specific way , @entity3 say a person could simply go into a shop and get an injection to protect them against a disease			1
this could be used to prevent mass outbreaks in affected areas			1
@entity2 military 's @entity3 has developed a method to stop infectious diseases			1
it involves encoding rna and dna with instructions for antibodies			1
a person could then be injected with the antibodies at a pharmacy ( stock image shown )			1
this enables a person 's cells to fight an infectious disease ‘ we ’re going to take the genetic code and put it into a format where you go to your drug store or doctor and get a shot in the arm , ’ said @entity3 programme manager @entity32 at an event in @entity34 , reported @entity35			1
@entity7 stands for ribonucleic acid			0
it is one of three important molecules that are essential for all known forms of life - as well as proteins and lipids			0
@entity7 is formed from strings of nucleic acids , the same building blocks that create @entity8			0
genetic information in a cell flows from @entity8 through @entity7 to proteins			0
@entity8 is considered the ' blueprint ' of the cell and @entity7 is what helps translate it			0
some life , like viruses , only use rna and it is thought that some of the earliest organisms on @entity62 used this molecule			2
proteins are considered to be the workhorses of the cell built up from strings of amino acids			0
these carry out the biochemical reactions that take place in the cell and make life tick			0
lipids are fatty molecules that line up in formation that can create protective vesicles			0
they form the membrane ' walls ' of every living cell and give them structure			0
they are also essential for sending signals out of the cell			0
‘ there ’s a low - cost of goods , no cold chain , and we would produce the correct antibody in [ any ] individual directly			0
’ the method works by creating powerful antibodies from survivors of an infectious disease			1
‘ instructions ’ on how to make these antibodies are then encoded into rna and dna , which are injected into people who might come into contact with the disease			1
their cells then start creating the antibodies , protecting them from catching the potentially dangerous disease			1
@entity3 is currently funding the project through @entity107 in @entity108			2
experts say the method , if proven to be safe and effective , would be faster and cheaper than conventional drug production and could potentially be used to treat illnesses such as seasonal flu or malaria			2
antibodies are typically grown in large vats of mammal cells or in some cases , tobacco plants , such as @entity2 pharmaceutical company @entity121 's experimental @entity6 treatment @entity122			1
experts say the method , if proven to be safe and effective , would be faster and cheaper than conventional drug production and could potentially be used to treat illnesses such as seasonal flu , malaria and @entity6			1
shown is a transmission electron micrograph ( @entity129 ) image of the ebola virus infectious diseases , such as @entity6 and @entity134 virus , will rapidly spread to new areas as a result of global warming			1
this is according to zoologist , professor @entity139 , who warned last month that humans can expect to face new illnesses as climate change brings crops , livestock , and humans into contact with pathogens			0
professor @entity139 says it will be ' the death of a thousand cuts ' with society unable to keep up with the speed of disease as it spreads around the world			0
' it 's not that there 's going to be one " @entity157 " that will wipe everybody out on the planet , ' professor @entity139 said , referring to the 1971 science fiction film about a deadly pathogen			0
' there are going to be a lot of localised outbreaks that put a lot of pressure on our medical and veterinary health systems			0
' @entity3 has awarded @entity107 up to £ 7.3 million ( $ 10.8 million ) over three years to direct the project			1
@entity107 is using blood samples from the @entity6 outbreak in @entity172 to test the method			2
initially , the technology was being developed in hopes of protecting soldiers from seasonal flu or germs that cause diarrhea on the battlefield , but the @entity6 outbreak presented an opportunity to accelerate the research			2
to succeed , researchers will need to identify an effective delivery system to carry the genetic instructions into the body and learn how to quickly identify the most protective antibodies			2
the goal is to get the process down to 90 days for most diseases			0
the group is in the process of characterising several @entity6 antibody candidates to find which are the most potent			2
at that point , the researchers and @entity3 will seek out drug company partners			2
testing in people could begin within two years , with the goal of having a better weapon for the next outbreak - whatever it may be .			1
