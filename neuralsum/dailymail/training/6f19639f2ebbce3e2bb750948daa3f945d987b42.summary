an @entity6 - born @entity8 cleric , second only to @entity9 on the world 's most - wanted list , @entity3 was eventually killed in @entity12 last september during a @entity6 drone strike			1
despite being named a major threat by the head of @entity17 ’s @entity16 and the first @entity6 to become one of the @entity20 ’s top targets , the @entity2 released him from custody after detaining him at @entity21 in october 2002			1
@entity20 top target : radical @entity4 cleric @entity3 was in @entity6 custody in 2002 but was allowed to walk free but the @entity2 have offered no explanation why @entity3 , who had lived in @entity25 and thought to be behind several @entity8 terrorist plots , had become the public face of the @entity29 terrorist organisation in the wake of @entity9 's death			1
former @entity2 agents said there are two possible explanations for @entity3 ’s abrupt release in 2002			1
that the @entity2 wanted to track him for intelligence or that the bureau wanted to work with him as a contact			2
the ‘ global terrorist ’ was detained at @entity21 in @entity40 after the customs database identified an outstanding arrest warrant			1
detained but let go : the ' global terrorist ' @entity3 was detained at @entity21 in @entity40 in 2002 @entity45 , the @entity2 ’s assistant director for national security told an enquiry yesterday that there had been conversations between an @entity2 agent and the @entity6 attorney in @entity52 about @entity3 ’s re-entry into the country and the warrant			1
he said : ‘ yes , sir , there was a dialogue , as there always will be			0
‘ if a case agent has a case on somebody that is coming into the country , the system is triggered and set up so that there will be a call to that case agent			0
’ but mr @entity69 could not explain how the @entity2 knew of the terrorist ’s return to @entity6 nor the reasons why he was allowed to walk free from custody			1
no explanation : @entity45 , the @entity2 's assistant director for national security could not explain how the @entity2 knew @entity3 was returning to the @entity6 or why he was allowed to walk free from custody at a hearing yesterday into the @entity79 report into the bureau ’s intelligence failures leading up to the @entity83 massacre , in which @entity84 was accused of killing 13 people and wounding 32 in @entity86 , links were made between @entity84 and @entity87			1
in an exchange of 19 emails @entity84 told @entity3 that he advocated using suicide bombers and that he believed it was ok to kill civilians to which @entity3 replied that @entity84 should keep his contact details handy			2
@entity96 rep @entity95 , chairman of the committee that oversees the @entity2 said at a hearing : ‘ i really want to get to the bottom ( of this ) ’ according to @entity101			0
‘ we ’re going to send a letter on this			0
if we can , we ’re going to get a hearing , and if we have to , we may even subpoena the thing			0
’ terrorist links : @entity3 ( left ) was thought to be behind several @entity8 terrorist plots and was linked to other terrorist such as @entity84 ( right ) who is accused of killing 13 in the @entity83 massacre @entity3 was being held when @entity2 agent @entity111 told customs agents that ‘ the warrant … had been pulled back ’ but documents show that the warrant was still active at that time and was only relinquished later that day			1
the bureau has always maintained that the case against @entity3 was weak and the pulling back of his arrest warrant was coincidental with the day he returned to @entity6			2
@entity120 was linked to the some of the september 11 hijackers and became the public face of @entity8 in the wake of @entity9 's death why he was able to walk free when scores of @entity4 men were held in detention centres on material witness warrants in the wake of september 11 attacks has never been explained by the @entity2			2
the terrorist has also been linked to september 11 hijackers , and was widely believed to be the mastermind behind a number of terror atrocities , the leader of @entity138 and inspired attacks by @entity4 inside the @entity6 including the @entity83 massacre			2
mr @entity45 said : ‘ if a prosecutor at that time , regardless of whether a call was made or not , looks at the evidence and decided there was not enough to be able to arrest that individual , the warrant would be dropped			0
‘ i assure you ... if we could have incarcerated @entity149 , we would have			0
’ but past and present investigators have said that once a warrant is signed off by a federal judge , it is not routine to review it			0
they have also questioned why an exemption was made for a person who under an @entity2 investigation because of his links to september 11 hijackers			0
mr @entity45 said the @entity2 will make a decision within 60 to 90 days , based on the findings of the report by former @entity2 and @entity20 director @entity79 .			0
