when it comes to sibling rivalry , no one is quite so extravagantly competitive as the @entity4 sisters			0
now their oneupmanship has spread to the most exclusive tier of the @entity9 property market			1
for just a few months after @entity11 bought a mansion once named as the most expensive home in the @entity14 , @entity10 is set to move into the house ranked no 2 – just down the road			1
the older daughter of @entity18 tycoon @entity4 is eyeing up the lavish @entity20 estate to add to her property portfolio , undeterred by its £ 78 million asking price			1
the five - acre estate in the @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity26 , was modelled on @entity28 ’s @entity27 – and certainly contains all the opulent luxuries a modern - day princess could demand			1
as well as its 12 bedrooms and 15 bathrooms , the mansion contains a 50 - seat , satin - lined private cinema , a two - storey wood - panelled library stocked with first - edition books and garage parking for nine cars			2
not to mention a gym , a ballroom based on @entity28 ’s @entity42 at @entity27 and a formal dining room			0
a moving story : @entity10 ' relocation to the @entity20 mansion will be chronicled on an @entity9 reality tv show @entity49 marble walls , @entity51 limestone floors and gold - embossed leather wall coverings all add to the decadent feel			1
and outside , the property boasts a spa pool with its own kitchen , an ornamental garden , a 1,200 - metre running track , a championship tennis court and a folly – plus private quarters to house up to ten live - in domestic staff the 45,000 sq ft house , tucked away behind gates and a 200 - yard driveway , was commissioned in 1996 by @entity68 billionaire @entity67 for his wife @entity69			2
it was completed in 2002 – but less than two years later the couple ’s 23 - year marriage collapsed			2
mrs @entity73 was awarded the estate in the divorce , and put it on the market in 2006 for £ 78 million			0
in 2010 , @entity77 named it as the second most expensive property in @entity9 – behind late tv guru @entity81 ’s 123 - room mansion , @entity82 , just down the road			1
sibling rivalry : just a few months after @entity85 ( right ) bought the mansion once named the as the most expensive home in the @entity9 , @entity10 is set to move into the house ranked @entity89 - just down the road silver screen : @entity10 can invite 49 of her closest friends to watch the latest blockbusters in her private cinema time to reflect : the gilded ballroom features mirror - clad arches based on those in the @entity42 in the @entity27 , as well as impressive chandeliers and a ceiling fresco and that was the home @entity11 bought from @entity81 ’s widow last year for a ‘ bargain ’ £ 53 million			1
it is the largest in @entity104 , and boasts a room solely designed for cutting flowers			0
the amount @entity11 paid for the @entity82 suggests @entity10 might be able to drive a hard bargain on @entity20 – even though mrs @entity73 has never dropped her price in the six years the estate has remained unsold			1
@entity10 , 28 , already owns a £ 45 million home in @entity113 – @entity115 ’s ‘ billionaires ’ row ’ known as the most exclusive address in @entity117			2
that 55 - room mansion is currently undergoing an £ 18 million renovation , due for completion next month			0
it includes a £ 1 million bathtub and special wardrobes for her £ 500,000 handbags collection			0
hints of chintz : with its gold - embossed walls , the bedroom features a clutter of antique furniture - including the canopied bed , chaise longue and dressing table - as well as gold - framed paintings ready for a feast : a gold and floral theme dominates the dining room , which can comfortably seat 16 guests ( left ) while the two - storey wood - panelled library ( right ) is stocked with first - edition books she is looking at @entity20 as she relocates to @entity146 this month			1
an eight - part reality series for @entity9 television will chart her move to the @entity14 – and @entity10 plans to rent the lavish property before buying it			1
the series follows the three - part programme billion $ $ girl for @entity155 , which similarly offered viewers an insight into her lifestyle , funded by her father ’s £ 2.3 billion fortune			1
however , it has been a tumultuous year for @entity10 , who separated from her boyfriend @entity163 after she discovered he had cheated on her – and made a sex tape of his encounter			2
so it is a strange coincidence that she is moving into an estate that is available only because of another romantic split			0
making a splash : the romanesque outdoor pool , surrounded by sun - loungers ... and if swimming makes you peckish , the columned pool house comes with its own kitchen @entity73 , who made his fortune developing the idea of using helicopters to provide up - to - date traffic reports , left @entity69 in 2003 for @entity181 , the family ’s 32 - year - old @entity182 nanny			2
the divorce , one of the most expensive in @entity9 history , came after @entity73 served his wife with divorce papers as the family ’s @entity189 made a stopover in @entity192 en route from @entity194 to @entity195			1
the reason was @entity68 is thought to be more sympathetic to men than @entity194 when it comes to alimony settlements			0
mrs @entity73 was once described in a @entity201 profile as ‘ probably the world ’s no 1 consumer of haute couture and 18th century furniture ’ – rumoured to buy matching designer sweaters and shoes in every colour available			0
in the past two years the @entity4 sisters have built a similar reputation for profligacy , including spending more than £ 100 million of the family fortune buying up homes in some of @entity115 ’s most prestigious postcodes			0
neighbours : the @entity216 - the 123 - room plae also in the @entity24 - that little sister @entity11 bought in 2010 , @entity11 , now 24 , paid £ 56 million for a @entity217 listed townhouse in @entity219 , @entity115 , previously owned by @entity221 billionaire sir @entity220			1
and she spent a reported £ 11 million on her @entity49 wedding to businessman @entity224 last year			0
her statuesque mother @entity225 – who divorced @entity4 in 2008 after 23 years of marriage – said at the time : ‘ i do n’t care how much the wedding cost , as it was once - in - a - lifetime occasion			0
it was worth every penny because it made my daughter happy			0
who cares about money ? ’ last night @entity236 declined to comment on her move to @entity26			0

@entity20 estate also features marble walls and gold - embossed leather
comes months after sister @entity11 bought house named most expensive in @entity9
eight - part reality tv series will chart @entity10 *'s* move to the @entity9
