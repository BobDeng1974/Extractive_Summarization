@entity0 faces legal action by the current ' owners ' of @entity3 as the @entity5 team stand on the brink of going out of business			1
@entity3 were bought from @entity8 entrepreneur @entity0 at the end of june by a consortium of @entity12 and @entity13 businessmen , since when the organisation has been forced to deal with numerous difficulties			1
already facing an unlawful dismissal suit by a group of more than 30 staff axed over the summer , on monday a supply company to the @entity20 - was placed in administration			0
@entity0 , pictured with @entity23 manager @entity22 , is facing legal action by @entity3 crucially , however , the consortium claims @entity26 and @entity27 owner @entity0 , along with two other former owners of the @entity5 team , failed to act in good faith with regard to the transfer of shares of ownership			1
in essence , the consortium has been running @entity3 over the course of the last few months without being the legal owners			2
given the countless issues , they have now decided to withdraw all management from the team and effectively told @entity0 he is again in charge			1
up until wednesday , @entity3 had been preparing as normal for the final three grands prix of the season in the @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47			2
but without management , and with @entity0 unlikely to step back in at such short notice , the team face the prospect of their campaign being brought to a premature end , and worse , folding altogether			1
@entity3 are in danger of going out of business after a four - year stay on the @entity5 grid via a strongly worded statement , the consortium said it is to take all legal recourse against @entity0 and other parties			1
the statement read : ' on 29 june 2014 , @entity62 , @entity63 and sheikh @entity64 ( @entity65 ) and their shareholders @entity0 and @entity67 entered into a @entity68 ( @entity69 ) with @entity70 ( @entity71 ) with regards to @entity74 / @entity73			2
' since the date of the agreement , the seller has refused to comply with its legal obligations to transfer their shares to the buyer			0
' the buyer has been left in the invidious position of funding the team without having legal title to the team it had bought			0
' this is in total contradiction to the seller 's press release of 3 october 2014 which stated that mr @entity0 and his @entity90 had no longer any connection with the @entity73			0
' the administrators of @entity93 have been appointed on behalf of @entity94 ( @entity95 ) , a creditor of mr @entity0 and the @entity90			0
the buyer has no connection with @entity95			0
' @entity20 was a supplier company to the @entity73			0
very regrettably , the administrators ' appointment has had devastating effects on the @entity5 team 's activities			1
' since their appointment , the administrators have released various press statements which have been severely detrimental to the management of the @entity73			0
' after three months of operating the @entity73 in good faith , the buyer is now forced to explore all its options including the withdrawal of its management team			1
' lawyers have been instructed by the buyer to bring all necessary claims against all parties , including mr @entity0 who , as an owner , will run the @entity5 operation			2
' team principal @entity119 has confirmed he has been forced to step back from managing the team , as well as insisting @entity0 remains the owner			2
@entity0 later hinted he had yet to be paid for @entity3 by the consortium			1
after retweeting a question from a follower - ' i wonder what @ tonyfernandes has to say ...			0
could it be he has n't received payment from the @entity12 / @entity13 investors ? Â£ @entity5 ' - he then posted : ' if you buy something you should pay for it			0
