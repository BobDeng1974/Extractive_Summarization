by @entity0 for @entity1 the airport scanners that caused controversy when it was revealed that they produced near naked images of travellers have come under fire again as researchers have found they also failed to detect concealed weapons			1
researchers from top @entity12 universities suggest that the @entity14 full - body scanner can be fooled by covering forbidden items with plastic sheets and under clothing			1
the findings , which are to be announced at the @entity21 security conference in @entity22 , also suggest that the scanner 's software can be hacked to present images at certain angles or to cover up certain sections of the body in ways that would be undetectable , the research scientists said			1
however , the scanners are still in operation at some government facilities such as prisons , as well as airports in @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48			2
the study 's authors say that the original approval of the scanners casts doubt over the @entity35 's process for evaluating the technology it currently uses			2
the @entity12 authorities spent £ 600million ( $ 1billion ) installing them at 160 airports before they were finally removed last year			1

one of the study 's lead authors , @entity68 , said : ' these machines were tested in secret , presumably without this kind of adversarial mindset , thinking about how an attacker would adapt to the techniques being used			0
' ' they might stop a naive attacker			0
but someone who applied just a bit of cleverness to the problem would be able to bypass them			0
and if they had access to a machine to test their attacks , they could render their ability to detect contraband virtually useless			2
' the team of researchers conducted their tests on an @entity59 1000 system they purchased on @entity94			0
while the scanners are no longer in use at major airports , they are still in operation at some government facilities such as prisons , as well as airports in @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 many airports still use other devices by @entity14 , including machines that scan carry - on @entity106 found that a metal gun taped to the side of a person 's body , or sewn into a trouser leg could be concealed			1
on its website , @entity14 says : ' deployed and tested in airports , as well as by law enforcement , homeland security and military organizations worldwide , @entity14 ’ family of @entity34 personnel screening products are the most proven , widely used and accepted advanced whole body imaging systems available today			1
the team of researchers conducted their tests on an @entity122 system they purchased on @entity94 ' it has been approved for use by multiple regulators , including the @entity12 @entity126 and the @entity128 @entity127			1
' the @entity34 can reveal threats concealed on a person ’s body that other technologies , such as metal detectors , can not			2
' the @entity34 can reveal even very small quantities of liquid explosives , non-metallic weapons , and plastic explosives , making it ideal for aviation security applications			0
' a spokesman for the @entity35 said the technology they use undergoes ' a rigorous testing and evaluation process , along with certification and accreditation			0
' the study was a joint effort of @entity148 , the @entity149 , and @entity150 .			0

body scanner fooled by covering contraband with plastic and under clothes
software can also be hacked to cover up certain sections of the body
scanners widely used in the @entity12 until last year and are still used *globally*
