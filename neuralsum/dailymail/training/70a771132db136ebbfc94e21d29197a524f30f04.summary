it is easy to sing hosannas for @entity2 , the boy who will make his @entity4 debut for @entity5 next year at 17 years of age , becoming the youngest driver in the sport ’s history			1
he is a talented driver by all accounts and appeared precociously assured before the assembled media in the paddock in @entity14 this weekend			1
many fellow racers here have given him a generous welcome to the most exclusive drivers ’ club in the world			2
here is @entity22 , the 2009 world champion , speaking self - deprecatingly about @entity23 , son of @entity25 , the @entity27 driver of the 1990s and early 2000s			1
‘ i knew his father because i raced against him , as did @entity40 ( @entity41 ) and @entity42 ( @entity43 ) , i think			0
somebody obviously thinks he ’s ready for @entity4 because they have given him the opportunity			1
‘ i got my drive with @entity48 when i was 19 years old			2
i was n’t ready for @entity4			1
i was ready when i was 23			1
but i took the opportunity because it might not come again			0
@entity50 ( @entity48 ) phoned me up – i was in the pub with my mates having a pint of beer – and said , “ do you think you are ready for @entity4 ? ” i said : “ definitely not ”			1
he said : “ ok , right , thank you			0
” ‘ i put the phone down and phoned my dad and he said , “ you ’re kidding me ! ” he said : “ phone him back and tell him you are			2
” so i called him back and said i was ready			2
@entity50 invited me to the factory and that ’s how it all started – i got the test and got the drive			0
' for anyone who comes into the sport and is given the opportunity , as a driver , a dad or a manager , you have to take it			2
whether @entity2 is ready , nobody knows			1
’ ready or not : @entity22 admitted he was n't ready for the challenges of @entity4 until the age of 23 pedigree : @entity23 on the podium during an @entity80 race at @entity81 @entity22 was being very fair			1
he raised doubts about the suitability of a 17 - year - old – which will make him two years younger than the youngest previous driver , @entity85 – but cautioned us against judging @entity23 by his own standards between the age of 19 and 23			1
@entity89 , a former team - mate of the young @entity22 at @entity90 , was less sympathetic towards the experiment			1
the 1997 world champion , who made his @entity4 debut aged 24 , said : ‘ basically , it ’s like getting all the presents without deserving anything			1
but there is this thing of “ the younger , the better ”			0
what 's the next step ? a team who will sign someone at 15 just to get the image out of it ? ‘ it is the wrong way round			0
@entity107 and @entity108 were good from the beginning but it takes time before you become an emperor			2
‘ he is still a boy so it is very risky			0
you do n’t take a 16 - year - old , who has n’t even been to university , into the best hospital as a doctor , even if he is very good and very intelligent			2
sceptical : former world champion @entity89 ( left ) , seen here with @entity23 ( right ) and his father @entity25 , said @entity5 's appointment represented a big risk number one : @entity23 celebrates after winning the @entity125 race last month ‘ you need to pay dues			1
you need to deserve it because that is only how you will become a man			0
’ speaking to @entity131 , @entity89 added : ‘ getting a @entity132 ( a prerequisite for @entity4 ) should be meaningful – not just doing three hundred kilometres and it being fine			1
’ i tend to agree with many of @entity89 ’s observations			2
@entity4 should be the pinnacle ; the final logical step in a career through various formulas			1
that a boy who only started racing cars this year , in @entity144 , can be deemed able to drive in @entity4 may reveal how easy it is – in comparison to years gone by – to drive these cars			1
when @entity148 , of @entity48 , stepped in to test earlier this season , she was alarmingly close to the team ’s regular race driver @entity151 on the timesheets , and , by all accounts , she is hardly @entity155			2
but more than anything i hope @entity2 is not burned in the exercise			2
being a former @entity4 racer while still in his teens would be an unwelcome conclusion to an astonishingly youthful beginning			1
@entity162 , 83 years old , is back in command behind the opaque glass – from the outside that is – of his portable hq			1
i suspect the underground movement that pressed for change in their longed - for @entity170 era will fall silent again now that he is not going to jail for bribery			0
it was always thus in @entity4			2
back in charge : @entity176 talks to reporters at @entity14 in advance of the @entity37 @entity179			1
he is once again able to concentrate his energies fully on @entity4 following the end of his bribery trial in @entity183 one senior paddock figure told me that he would like to excise the whole current crop of drivers			1
they are , he thought , too highly trained in the dark , spin - doctoring wiles of saying nothing interesting			0
this view is not entirely misplaced			0
@entity192 , for example , was coy despite being angry with @entity193 for not moving over as instructed during the last race in @entity195			0
perhaps he was being smart , but some former drivers would have given vent to their feelings			0
or , to put it another way , told it how it was			0
ditto with @entity203 ’s @entity202 and the curious issue of whether he would race this weekend in @entity37			0
he provided no explanation for his reinstatement a day after announcing he would sit out the grand prix			0
however , we journalists are not entirely blame - free in all this obfuscation			0
we criticise people for small slips of the tongue			0
the relationship between press and participant worsens			0
it is a vicious circle			0
guarded : @entity192 had little to say on @entity193 and @entity219 team orders in his press conference ahead of the @entity37 @entity179			0

@entity2 , 16 , will make his @entity4 debut for @entity5 next season and become the youngest driver in history at 17 years of age
@entity228 looked composed in front of the media this week and has been welcomed into the sport by the other drivers
@entity22 admitted he was not ready for @entity4 until the age of 23
@entity89 was sceptical about the decision , saying @entity4 should be the pinnacle of a career , not the beginning
