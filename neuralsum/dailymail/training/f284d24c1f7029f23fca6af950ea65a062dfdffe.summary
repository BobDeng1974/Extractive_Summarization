council officials ordered the 14 foxes to be killed after the holes were discovered in the structure of a dam wall in @entity6			1
they said the holes risked creating structural damage to the dam , putting 80 homes at risk of flooding			1
but wildlife experts said the cull will not solve the problem at @entity25 , @entity26 , as more foxes are likely to colonise the empty den and keep burrowing			2
urban wildlife consultant @entity30 , who is working with @entity31 , said : ‘ shooting the foxes is pointless because within three days new ones will move in			1
‘ the burrowing into the embankment will weaken it and the foxes will keep digging if they can			2
‘ the bank needs to be dealt with it and that is what i will be looking at with the council			0
’ not all residents supported the operation			0
@entity46 , 54 , who lives nearby , said : ‘ the park is a nature reserve and you expect there to be wildlife			0
i think it ’s inhumane and sickening			0
‘ the traps were very loud , imagine a gate clanging , that is how loud it was and i heard it twice from my house			0

failure of the dam would place more than 80 local properties at risk of serious flooding			1
‘ before deciding on the best course of action we thoroughly investigated all the pest control measures available			2
‘ @entity92 carried out the operation using approved methods			0
‘ they are licensed to use firearms with considerable experience in this kind of pest control			2
‘ the company informed @entity26 police who raised no objections and the foxes were humanely destroyed on the night of the operation using firearms			0
‘ our engineers are now in discussion with a wildlife specialist to find a longer term solution that will discourage future attention from foxes			0
