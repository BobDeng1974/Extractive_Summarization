he added : ‘ the problem was , we were speaking from different positions			0
‘ there were other people saying , “ there are political problems , economic problems – the best way to solve them is regime change			0

’ the @entity7 government helped to broker a power - sharing agreement between @entity17 and the opposition @entity40 ( @entity40 ) in 2008			0
lord @entity42 , who was @entity43 during mr @entity4 ’s first term , disclosed in 2007 that ‘ people were always trying to get me to look at ’ toppling mr @entity8 by force			2
however he did not say these requests had come from the prime minister himself , and suggested he did not consider it a serious proposition			0

’ he claimed the idea was rejected because @entity15 had no right to decide who leads @entity7 countries , adding : ‘ you are coming from @entity83 , you do n’t like @entity8 for whatever reason and we are going to remove him and we are going to put someone else in his place ? ‘ why does it become @entity15 responsibility to decide who leads the people of @entity5 ? so we said , “ no , let @entity5 sit down , let them talk ”			1
