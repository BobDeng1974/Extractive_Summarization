who needs enemies when you have friends like these ? while it is never advisable to drink yourself into oblivion , if someone does find themselves in such a predicament , it 's not unreasonable to hope their friends would be on hand to help them			2
not so for this unfortunate reveller			0
the incident occurred shortly shortly after 5pm on march 23			0
photographs of the scene snap three police officers turning up to take charge of the situation and they eventually manage to revive the man			1
however , he seems far from pleased at how his day has turned out , shouting at the police as they get back into their van and , slightly disorientated , even falling into it			0
the police arrived but , after reviving the man , left him at the scene with his companions the three men took their time to make sure their friend 's face , back and chest were completely covered after the officers have left , the video shows him picking a fight with his companions , presumably over their penmanship , before disappearing around the corner with them			1
a spokeswoman for the @entity55 said they have no record of being called out to this incident and that it is likely the officers were simply passing and decided to lend a helping hand			0
the @entity62 recorded a call that matches the time and location of the incident but , because the ambalance was cancelled and recalled before it arrived on scene , their logs can not confirm whether they were driving to attend to this man or not			2
police officers turned up to take control of the situation and save the man from further defacement after carrying the man away from the main thoroughfare , the police were able to wake him from his stupor aggressive : the man was not happy with the police waking him up , shouting at them as they got into their van and even collapsing into the side of it squabble : he seemed annoyed at his companions for their penmanship , even picking a fight with one of the other men before they all disappeared around a corner			1
