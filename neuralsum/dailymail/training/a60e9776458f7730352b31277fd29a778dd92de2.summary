by @entity1 reporter published : 05:21 est , 1 december 2012 updated : 05:21 est , 1 december 2012 @entity3 shooting star @entity2 may be forced to quit the sport after his practice range was accused of polluting a multi-millionaire neighbour ’s land with pellets			1
equities trader @entity9 claims that lead pellets from @entity11 ( @entity11 ) - where @entity2 trains - are raining down onto his £ 6million @entity14 estate , killing livestock and polluting the land			1
the owner of @entity11 fears a legal row over the issue could force the business to close as early as january with the loss of 40 jobs			1
on the brink : @entity2 , who won gold for @entity25 in the double trap shooting , may be forced to hang up his shotgun the firing range : @entity30 facility where @entity2 trains if that happens mr @entity2 , 26 , will have to make a six - hour round trip to @entity33 to practice - forcing him to hang up his shotgun			1
he said : ' i had heard that closure was a possibility but i never thought it would come to this , never in a million years			0
the impact would be dreadful			0
' i do n’t have enough money to move , so living at home is my only option right now			0
' i would have to quit the sport , i would have to call it a day - it is as drastic as that			0
' how many other @entity46 are out there that would be affected by this ? ' the shooting range at @entity51 has more than 450 fully - automatic traps and was an official training range for @entity54			1
complaint : the home of @entity9 who claims that lead pellets from the shooting range are ruining his land in @entity14 doubt : @entity2 may not represent his country at @entity63 in 2016 it has been the long - term training base of mr @entity2 - winner of the @entity67 event at @entity54 - who lives just a few miles away at @entity69 near @entity70			1
mr @entity9 , a former head of @entity72 equity derivatives at @entity73 , bought the neighbouring 3,000 acre estate at @entity75 for £ 6million in 2001			1
he set about restoring the heavily - farmed land into an organic paradise where he now rears and sells traditional breeds of sheep , pig and cattle under the @entity83 label			0
mr @entity9 said he does not want the shooting range to close and is simply trying to protect his land			1
he said : ' we are not trying to close the shooting ground at all			1
how the shooting ground operates is nothing to do with me			2
' all i have been trying to stop , as has the @entity91 and @entity92 , is levels of toxic lead falling on my agricultural farmland			2
' unfortunately the lead levels have become so high on the land neighbouring the shooting ground that my crops have been destroyed , my lambs have been slaughtered and the land has been declassified as organic			1
gold - medallist @entity2 would have to do a daily six - hour round trip to @entity33 from his @entity14 home when training if his local shooting range closes tender hooks : bosses of the @entity30 facility , pictured , are concerned a legal battle could force the range out of business ' it is not fit for agricultural consumption , there is a fear about lead contamination into the watercourse and because of that the various agencies have said that further lead deposits have to stop because of those fears			1
' we are seeking to stop further lead deposits and that is all it is			0
' but @entity123 , manager of @entity11 , said he can not afford to wage a legal battle against his wealthy neighbour and will have to close rather than see the case go to court			1
he added : ' we have been here for 53 years and we have always dropped lead on to that land			0
@entity9 knew that when he bought the farm ten years ago			2
' for the first eight years , he used to come up here for shooting lessons			0
then , two years ago , he started complaining - he says his lambs had to be slaughtered , but they were slaughtered for human consumption , not because they were contaminated			0
' he ’s got all the money in the world , and over 3,000 acres of land			0
' why he ’s complaining about only 60 acres of land i ’ll never know - he ’s got plenty more land and we are offering to buy it from him for three times market rate			0
' he added that if the business closed , the nearest professional range would be in @entity33			2
mr @entity123 said : ' @entity2 would have to travel to @entity33 and that ’s totally impractical			2
you can put ranges on your own land but it ’s not the same as shooting at a professional range			2
' the @entity91 are aware of the situation but declined to comment .			0
