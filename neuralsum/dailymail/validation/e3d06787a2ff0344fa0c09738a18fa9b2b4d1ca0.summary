@entity1 manager @entity0 is adamant @entity2 is the perfect man to take the club forward after the 23 - year - old was appointed the @entity6 's youngest chairman this week			1
owner @entity7 , 78 , stepped down from his day - to - day duties at the @entity9 after 20 years this week and entrusted those responsibilities to his young grandson			2
although that succession plan had long been in the pipeline for the @entity7 family , the fact @entity2 is coming into a position of power at such a tender age still raised eyebrows			1
@entity2 is the new chairman of @entity1 after taking over from his grandfather @entity7 @entity7 stepped down from his day - to - day duties at the club and handed over the role to his grandson however , @entity0 is familiar with @entity2 having worked closely alongside him since his appointment in november and the 23 - year - old , who was only officially appointed on to the board on @entity27 , took on a more central role with chief executive @entity29 during the recent six - week ban imposed on @entity7 by the @entity31			1
and @entity0 has seen enough of @entity2 to be convinced the @entity33 outfit are in excellent hands			2
' it 's easy to have a throwaway line about a 23 - year - old taking over a football club but he 's been round about the football club since he was a young man , ' said @entity0			2
' he 's here every day , is at every game and knows the inside of the football club			0
i look at the experience and the amount of time somebody has been at a football club			0
@entity0 is familiar with @entity2 and believes the 23 - year - old will be a good chairman at the club ' he 's got good people round about him and i know the things that drive him , the things he 's passionate about and they are good values for wanting a football club to go forward in terms of academy and recruitment			1
' @entity7 had cited his age as the motivating factor behind his decision to step back and he will address @entity1 supporters to say farewell before saturday 's home clash with @entity64			1
@entity0 has only been at the club for a few months but paid tribute to the impact @entity7 had made on the 2013 @entity69 winners , who he took from the fourth tier into the top flight , where they spent eight seasons prior to relegation two seasons ago			0
@entity0 also paid tribute to @entity7 for the work he did as @entity1 chairman over the last 20 years @entity7 kisses the @entity69 after @entity1 beat @entity77 at @entity78 before being relegated in 2013 ' he 's put his heart , soul and life into this football club over the last 20 years , ' added the @entity83			1
' i played at @entity85 a long time ago and to then 20 years later have a team that have a beautiful stadium , a lovely training ground and have won the @entity69 and played in the @entity89 is quite a story in anybody 's book			0
' he 's manufactured and moulded that			0
it 's a fitting tribute tomorrow to him			0
' @entity1 's @entity95 celebrates after an important win away at @entity97 for the relegation - threatened side			0
