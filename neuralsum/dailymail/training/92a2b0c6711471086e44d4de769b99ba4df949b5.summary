by mail online reporter it is the modern phenomenon that makes us the star of our travel snaps - the unavoidable selfie			0
but there is a time and a place for a quick self - referencing moment of camera fun			0
and when you 're being chased by an angry bovine in the middle of a bull run , it is not the most sensible moment to stop and take a snap			1
but that 's exactly what this amateaur ' matador ' decided to do , while running down the streets away from the rampaging animal in the @entity24 city of @entity25			1
turning his back to snap the selfie in the video , every viewer can see what is going to happen next - except the tourist			1
as he stops to take the photo , the angry bull comes running down the alleyway and charges straight into him			0
setting up the shot : the man readies himself for his moment of glory he 's behind you : the unsuspecting photographer does n't seem to see his assailant closing in wrong time , wrong place : the man is about to pick up an unexpected souvenir of his trip and as if being flung into the air - narrowly missing being gored - is not enough , once the bull has charged once , it quickly turns around for a second go , just as the photographer is getting to his feet			1
luckily , the man appears to walk away from his clash with the bull unhurt - but one would imagine his pride has n't escaped unscathed			2
@entity55 is not the only country where the dubious art of bull - running takes place during the summer months – as @entity25 , which sits near to the @entity61 coast in the south - west of the country – was demonstrating on sunday			2
and that 's what happens : the man is knocked over as the bull charges forward now you have my attention : the man abandons his photographic plans as the bull continues to chase him to his credit , at least the bull runner was wearing an all - white outfit of t - shirt and shorts – rather than a red ensemble which might have been more eye - catching for the rampaging bovine			0
but turning his back on the bull as he tried to take his selfie was never likely to be a good idea – as the bull proved by ramming his head into the unobservant tourist ’s bare legs .			0
