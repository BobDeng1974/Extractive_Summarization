while many risked their lives going out into the waters this morning , witnesses believe it was surger @entity15 who rode the tallest wave - possibly beating the world record set by @entity21 surfer @entity20 in 2011			1
@entity20 's wave was estimated to be 78ft tall , but the waves hitting off the coast of @entity25 near @entity26 were noticeably taller			2

@entity74 nearly drowned and had to be resuscitated on the beach when she fell on a wave and her jet - ski partner could not get to her in time			2
she was rescued unconscious and taken to hospital , where she was reportedly doing well despite suffering a broken ankle			0

married mr @entity99 , whose wife @entity108 and two children honey , six , and @entity111 , one , are currently braving the storm at home on the @entity102 coast , was towed into the waves by his @entity117 surfing partner @entity20			2
the duo work together in big waves by towing one another into the swells using a jet - ski , because waves of that size move so quickly it is impossible to paddle into the wave using just arm power			1
@entity128 surfer @entity99 rides an 80ft wave at the @entity89 do @entity90 , north beach , at the fishing village of @entity26 in @entity25 the married father - of - two took on the monster waves caused by @entity133 it is not the first time mr @entity99 has been involved in a surfing world record - two years ago he was driving the jet - ski when he towed mr @entity20 into a giant wave at the same spot in 2011			1
the beach is well - known in surfing circles as a mecca for huge waves because it picks up the full brunt of the violent @entity145 storm swells			1
mr @entity99 had been avidly monitoring weather data and eagerly anticipating the waves created by @entity7 's hitting @entity25 , but was disappointed because the biggest waves created by the storm actually hit overnight before sunrise			2
he said he could hear the waves pounding the shoreline overnight from inside the beach house he is staying in , saying the monster swells were even making the walls shake			1
this morning mr @entity99 and his team were in the water before light at 6am , along with scores of other surfers all trying to ride the biggest wave			2
mr @entity99 said : ' the storm that hit @entity128 last night started the waves hitting here last night			2
the house was shaking last night			0
we 're staying in a house on the beach and i 've stayed here before when it 's been big and the odd set made the walls shake , but last night the whole thing was just shaking all night			0
' crowds watch on as brave @entity175 surfer @entity99 glides into an 80ft monster wave but despite the ominous rumbling , mr @entity99 said he slept remarkably well and was in the water raring to go before light			0
he caught two waves before the potential record - breaker , which he believes was at around 8am , after he 'd been in the sea for about two hours			2
mr @entity99 described the moment he was towed - in to the monster : ' @entity20 heard on the radio that the third wave looked good so he just popped me in there in the perfect position			0
it was really bumpy , i spent most of the time just trying to stay on my feet , it 's like you ca n't go fast enough , it 's not like normal surfing			0
' mr @entity99 said it is hard for him to judge exactly how big a wave that size is , particularly as he is riding it			0
he said : ' everyone wants to put figures on it , there were definitely 80ft waves there today , some even bigger , it was ridiculous , everyone got huge waves today , it was frightening out there			1
an unidentified surfer wipes out at a giant wave at @entity89 do @entity90 during a swell that hit the @entity25 coast , at @entity26 , @entity25 ' it 's a really dangerous place because it 's not a point break or a headland , it 's a beach , so there 's no way round and if you fall you 're left swimming in 60ft white water			1
' mr @entity99 did fall on the wave after the potential record - breaker because the wind had become really strong and was making the surface of the water difficult to ride			0
he said : ' it started to get choppy , i was n't gliding i was literally bouncing from chop to chop and i ended up catching and edge and just slammed down			0
i was under for quite a while			0
' mr @entity99 is planning on staying in @entity25 for the rest of the week as there are further big swells predicted for wednesday			0
' hopefully there 's more to come but with surfing you could wait ten years for it to get this big again , i just have to make sure i 'm ready when it comes			0
