caretaker @entity1 manager @entity0 conceded that he was deeply embarrassed by @entity1 fans booing their own team after their @entity5 defeat at @entity6 – but insisted that he still wanted the job of head coach at the club after @entity11 ’s move to @entity12 was confirmed			1
@entity0 made seven changes and saw his @entity1 side go down 1 - 0 in a lacklustre performance and led his players over to a packed out contingent of travelling supporters – only to be greeted by boos and chants of : ‘ we ’re s * * * and we ’re sick of it			1
’ @entity1 fans gestured for the players to go away and also directed abuse at owner @entity25 but @entity0 said the fans the right to criticise the team in the light of the defeat			1
‘ the one thing i was n’t going to allow was that the players did n’t go over to them			2
i was in front of everybody because we deserved it			2
i that ’s how they feel , they pay their money their entitled to do that			0
' and i ’m not going to shirk my responsibilities and it ’s important the players did n’t either			0
it was important we went across and show appreciation for our support			0
’ @entity0 still wants the job , despite the reaction from fans and said : ‘ i ’d be a fool if i did n’t want to be head coach of this football club			1
obviously results dictates that happens but i do n’t feel any different			0
i still want to be head coach			0
’ he admitted that he had had no conversations with owner @entity25 since taking over the reins from @entity11 on monday – and that his sole contact with the board has been with managing director @entity72			1
but @entity0 says that even with the transfer window open , there is no need to speak to the owner as the new head coach – whether @entity0 or a new appointment – wo n’t have any say in transfer dealings			1
@entity0 said : ‘ i ’ve not spoken to @entity25 and my only communication has been with @entity72 on monday night and a short conversation last night just about the game today			1
@entity0 ( right ) watches on alongside @entity6 manager @entity83 as his side were beaten @entity85 ( left ) scored the only goal of the game as @entity6 beat @entity1 ‘ it will be confusing ( to fans ) but the only thing i will say is that the position is not now as a manager - it ’s now a head coach ’s job			1
so the head coach ’s job is to get the team ready and prepared for the next game and that ’s all i ’ve been thinking about			2
‘ there ’s no need for me to be in touch with owner because that ’s the line the club is going down now – head coach			0
when i was with @entity104 in the @entity105 , i was head coach so i never got involved in any transfer dealings			0
my sole responsibility was to look after the team and get them prepared and ready for the game			2
’ @entity0 admits that he will be judged on @entity112 form but said that did n’t excuse the @entity5 exit			1
‘ it hurts me because i grew up watching the @entity5 and i ’ve been to a final and lost and i ’ve been to a semi-final with sir @entity118 and lost			0
and that was n’t a nice feeling			0
' i went and watched a final when @entity123 was manager against @entity124 and i was in with the fans and i was so disgruntled and i was in with them			2
so i know how important the @entity5 is but ultimately @entity112 football is very important			0
