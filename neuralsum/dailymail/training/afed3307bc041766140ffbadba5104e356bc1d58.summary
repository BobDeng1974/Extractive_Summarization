by @entity0 for @entity1 controversial footage claiming to show the wreckage of an @entity5 drone shot down near an @entity7 power plant has been aired on television in @entity7			1
the video has prompted questions about how a plane with limited range could have penetrated so deeply into the country and whether it is indeed what @entity14 says it is			1
the brief clip showed what the channel described as parts of the battleship - gray drone scattered in an unidentified desert area			0
the unmanned device was identified as a @entity23 450 , a known @entity5 model			1
the claim comes as @entity7 negotiates with world powers over its contested nuclear program and @entity7 hard - liners press moderate president @entity44 to demand more concessions before limiting the country 's atomic capabilities			0
the @entity48 suspects @entity7 's nuclear program is geared toward building a nuclear weapon - however the country denies the charge , saying its nuclear activities are for peaceful purposes only , such as power generation and medical research			2
@entity5 has not ruled out taking unilateral military action against @entity7 's nuclear facilities			1
@entity7 's powerful @entity27 said in a statement on sunday that its forces fired a missile as the drone neared @entity7 's uranium enrichment facility in @entity65 , 150 miles south of the capital , @entity14			1
guard spokesman @entity67 also said that @entity7 allowed the drone to continue its path to find out more about its mission			0
general @entity70 , head of @entity7 's @entity27 's airspace division , has insisted the drone was @entity5 , though he said its last flight originated elsewhere general @entity70 , head of the guard 's airspace division , insisted on monday that the drone was @entity5 , though he said its last flight originated elsewhere			1
he said : ' the operational range of the drone indicates it did not start its flight in @entity5 but departed from a country in the region			2
' @entity7 @entity84 spokeswoman @entity83 condemned the drone 's presence as a violation of @entity7 territorial integrity and said ' pursuing the case in legal and international bodies is our right ' , the semi-official @entity82 news agency reported			1
mr @entity70 said the drone 's range was about 500 miles and that it had two front and side cameras capable of providing high - resolution panoramic imaging			2
however , the manufacturer of the @entity23 , @entity5 - based @entity96 , lists its base range as only 200 miles			0
@entity5 is about 620 miles away from @entity7 's westernmost boundary and @entity65 is about 370 miles inland from the closest border point in @entity7			1
other countries also operate @entity23 drones , including @entity103 , the @entity104 and @entity105 , @entity7 's neighbor to the north			2
@entity7 's elite @entity27 ( pictured above testing missiles in 2006 ) believe the drone was launched by @entity5 from another country in the region @entity7 state - linked media previously touted @entity7 - made drones that bore some resemblance to the @entity5 model			1
according to @entity103 aviation expert @entity118 , this could be what is shown in the footage			0
mr @entity118 said it is possible that the @entity5 drone could operate beyond its official range , but he too was skeptical given how far into @entity7 airspace the drone would have penetrated			2
he said : ' if this seems to be posing a threat , you do n't let it fly for hundreds of miles			0
it does n't ring true			0
' @entity5 considers @entity7 's nuclear program to be a grave threat , and @entity5 intelligence closely monitors the program			1
@entity7 's nuclear program has been targeted by espionage and sabotage efforts in the past			2
in 2010 , the so - called @entity140 virus temporarily disrupted operation of thousands of centrifuges , key components in nuclear fuel production , at @entity65			0
@entity7 says it and other computer virus attacks are part of a concerted effort by @entity5 , the @entity104 and their allies to undermine its nuclear program through covert operations			0
@entity5 has never commented on the allegations but is widely believed to have been involved in the @entity140 attack			0
@entity7 has also said that it discovered tiny timed explosives planted on centrifuges but disabled them before they could go off .			0

@entity7 's military say they brought down aircraft appearing to be @entity5 model
drone was said to be flying near facility in @entity65 , 150 miles south of @entity14
device 's limited range means unlikely it could have been launched from @entity5
@entity7 @entity84 say they plan to pursue international legal action
