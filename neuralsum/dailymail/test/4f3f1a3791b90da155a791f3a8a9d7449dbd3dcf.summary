@entity1 winger @entity0 is facing a race against time to be fit for the @entity3 after it emerged he has undergone surgery on his injured shoulder			1
it was hoped the @entity8 - bound star might yet return to play a part in the @entity11 run - in for @entity12 after being out of action since january â€” but head coach @entity14 reported on thursday that he had suffered a setback and has now played his last game for the club			1
with the news that the 26 - year - old will miss the rest of the season , national boss @entity18 will naturally be concerned he is fit in time for the @entity3 which starts in september			1
@entity0 is leaving @entity12 to play in the @entity23 with @entity8 next season @entity14 said : ' @entity0 got some tough news last week when it became clear his shoulder would require surgery			1
' but the operation at @entity30 was a success and he 's targeting to be back for the @entity3			1
' @entity0 , who has 15 caps for @entity1 and toured with the @entity33 in 2013 , picked up the injury when the @entity12 lost at @entity35 in the @entity36 and was subsequently ruled out of the @entity37			1
with the @entity40 - born player leaving @entity41 for the @entity23 in the summer , his operation has denied @entity43 fans a final opportunity to see him play in their colours			1
@entity14 said : ' i 'd like to take this opportunity to thank @entity0 for his contribution to the club , he 's been an excellent player for us			1
' former @entity51 player @entity0 has won 15 caps for @entity1 meanwhile , @entity14 believes there is a real determination in his squad to secure a win over @entity57 tonight for team - mates @entity58 and @entity60 who retire at the end of the season			1
the veteran pair have been included in the starting line - up at @entity41 with warriors needing victory to edge closer to a top - four finish for the fourth year in a row			2
' this week is really important for the club because we have only have four league matches left , ' said the head coach			0
' i have also seen the players really focus in on the win because they want to pay tribute to @entity58 and @entity60			0
' tonight we want to celebrate what they have done for the club			0
' @entity43 coach @entity14 has been able to call upon the services of star fly half @entity82 once more @entity14 has made a number of changes from the side that drew 34 - 34 away to @entity86 a fortnight ago			2
in the backs , fit - again duo @entity87 and @entity88 come in as does @entity90 at full - back			2
four changes in the pack sees props @entity94 and @entity96 start alongside @entity60 while @entity97 replaces @entity98 at @entity99			0
@entity1 trio @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 are on the bench after returning from injury			1
the @entity57 , currently in 10th place , will be without injured prop @entity106 but still have talent like @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 in the starting xv			2
@entity112 captain @entity108 has been named to start for @entity113 against @entity43 at @entity41 @entity14 is not taking their challenge lightly			0
' @entity113 look to keep the ball alive at all times and if you look at the stats from the league , they are the ones who pass the ball the most , ' he said			0
' when your game - plan is to go out and attack and keep hold of the ball and you have nothing to lose , then they could be really dangerous opponents			2
' we need our defence to be putting them under pressure if they are moving the ball a lot			0
' on paper they have some fantastic individuals in their side like @entity108 and other internationals and now that they are out of @entity142 they will want to finish the season on a high			0
' young warriors prop @entity145 , 20 , has joined @entity146 on loan until the end of the season			0
