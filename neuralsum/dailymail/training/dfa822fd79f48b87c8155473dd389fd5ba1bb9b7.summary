we will continue to support him in his journey to earn a spot playing for the @entity8			0
' as a seventh - round draft pick , @entity2 will face hefty challenges just to make the @entity8			1
being the subject of a tv documentary could have been a major distraction for the defensive end from @entity64			0
spotlight : @entity2 and his boyfriend @entity66 celebrated his drafting in @entity68 this weekend			0
he has since flown to @entity69 to begin training			0
it 's unclear how much access the crews will be granted by the @entity3 or @entity8 hard road ahead : during his time at the @entity76 , @entity2 was named @entity77 , but will likely have to train for a different position if he wants to make the @entity8 53 - man roster ' this ( postponement ) will allow for @entity2 to have a total focus on football , and will ensure no distractions to his teammates , ' added @entity2 's agent , @entity86			1

shooting had reportedly already begun on the project , but it 's uncertain how much access the @entity3 and @entity8 would grant production crews now that @entity2 is in training			1
@entity2 was named @entity77 during his time at the @entity76 , but is considered too small to be a defensive end in the league at six - foot - two and 261 pounds			2
