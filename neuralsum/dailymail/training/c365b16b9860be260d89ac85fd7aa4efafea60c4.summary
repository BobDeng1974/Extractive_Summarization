by @entity0 published : 16:30 est , 4 april 2014 updated : 16:30 est , 4 april 2014 april is when rocket is at its very best			1
most of the rocket that is sold in supermarkets or dished up in a restaurant is the perennial wild rocket , @entity7 , with its slender , finely indented leaves			1
it ’s good - i grow it with enthusiasm - but nothing compared to well - grown sweet rocket , @entity15 , eaten fresh from the garden			1
i harvest rocket almost daily for nine months of the year , between the beginning of september and the end of june and at any one time will have two or even three crops on the go			1
in practice the plants are perennial and a friend of mine in @entity27 has some in a container that she has kept for the past five years			1
@entity0 says that april is the month when @entity15 is at its very best but i treat them as annuals and if you taste rocket in spring at its best you will always be searching for that melting , spicy succulence that no other season can provide			1
@entity37 ' has never flowered or had berries			1
where am i going wrong ? @entity40 , @entity41 @entity44 flowers on wood grown the previous year , so are you pruning it too drastically ? @entity47 reduces flowering too			1
q. my garden is overrun with @entity50			2
how can i eradicate it ? mrs @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 @entity55 is known as wild garlic ( as is the more common @entity57 ) , and every part of the plant is delicious to eat – it makes excellent pesto			2
it can be very invasive , though , especially in damp shade			2
eat as much as possible and cut the top growth to weaken next year 's bulbs			2
q. i have two large blue agapanthus , grown from seed many years ago			2
should i cut the leaves back each year or let them die back naturally ? mrs @entity70 , @entity72 , @entity73 @entity44 you should never cut back agapanthus			2
the foliage of herbaceous agapanthus will die back each autumn , whereas evergreen types will retain their leaves			2
it is important to water well after flowering and feed weekly to ensure good flowering the following year			0
as a rule all agapanthus flower best when their roots are restrained , so repotting will often stop flowering for a few years until the roots have grown			0
it is very happy growing in an unheated greenhouse and although the taste of the winter leaves is welcome enough when there are few other fresh salad leaves , they are only half as good as their spring cousins			0
after radish - to which it is related , both being members of the @entity100 family - it is the easiest of all seeds to germinate			1
i suggest sowing it any time between january and may or july and september			0
@entity106 the seeds out onto any old soil or compost and they will grow			1
but the crucial thing is to thin boldly and transplant them early			0
rocket seeds are biggish and reasonably easy to handle so i now sprinkle two or three per plug , wait until at least two germinate successfully and then ruthlessly thin down to one healthy seedling			1
these can then be grown on and hardened off until they are about two or three inches tall before planting out at 15cm ( 6in ) spacing			0
you can easily sow them direct but they will still need fierce thinning			0
this will seem ridiculously generous with space but closer spacing does not result in any greater harvest of the leaves and as the widely spaced plants have lots of nutrition and water , they are much healthier and last longer			0
i start picking leaves as soon as they are large enough to handle and expect to make three or four pickings from each plant over as many months			1
the leaves can vary hugely in size and shape with some having no indentation other than an odd crinkle and others scooped back to the stem			0
in my experience taste is not affected			0
@entity15 does not like very hot weather and needs rich soil with plenty of water to be at its best			1
a damp spring and cool summer suits it admirably			0
but usually by the middle of may the plants are starting to bolt and flower , growing a thick , hairy stem with fewer and hotter leaves			0
the flowers are perfectly edible and the summer seeds provide all of next year ’s crop			1
slugs will nibble at very young seedlings but tend to leave them alone once they start growing vigorously			0
a much greater problem is the flea beetle , which will pinprick each leaf with innumerable small holes , each of which will create a scarring , toughening reaction			0
as a consequence , taste and all - round plant health suffers			0
but the life cycle of the flea beetle coincides with the plant ’s most urgent desire to reproduce and set seed , so around the middle of june i leave a few plants to set seed and pull up the rest and have a rocketless season over high summer			0
but that only serves to whet my appetite and new seeds are sown in early august ready for harvest from early september , and another sowing at the end of the month provides plants to grow under glass for our winter supply .			1
