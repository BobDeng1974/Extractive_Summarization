the @entity1 team will be battling their emotions and ‘ inner demons ’ when they play the first test since the death of @entity6			1
the @entity7 take on @entity8 in a rescheduled first test at @entity6 ’s adopted home ground , the @entity11 , in what is sure to be an emotional atmosphere			1
players will wear @entity6 ’s @entity15 408 on their shirts , as well as black armbands			1
they will line up on the outfield before the first day ’s play , in front of a giant 408 painted on the grass , to watch a video tribute to their former team - mate , which will be followed by 63 seconds of applause — the score on which @entity6 was unbeaten when he was fatally injured by a bouncer during a domestic @entity30 match just under two weeks ago			1
@entity31 said preparing for it has been ' the most challenging couple of days ' of his career all - rounder @entity31 is one of four members of the @entity36 squad who were on the outfield at the @entity38 at the time @entity6 was struck while playing for @entity1			1
he is confident all squad members will be physically and emotionally ready to play but he spoke honestly and openly about the impact @entity6 ’s death has had on him since returning to training two days after the 25 - year - old ’s funeral			1
he said : ‘ mentally , it ’s been the most challenging couple of days i ’ve had to go through in my career , after seeing what happened over the past week , trying to process everything that happened , especially being there at the @entity38			2
‘ the first couple of sessions were tough , especially the first one			0
a few things flooded into my head as soon as i went out to bat … i thought i ’d processed quite well over the previous week			0
@entity31 said it would be difficult facing aggressive bowling after what happened to @entity6 ‘ this has been as important a four days ’ lead up to a test match that i have ever been involved in because there are a lot of inner demons that we ’ve had to find our way through			1
’ for @entity31 , one of those demons involves facing up to top quality , aggressive , fast bowling — something he has done without a second thought for 52 tests and 178 odis since his international debut in 2002			1
suddenly , having witnessed close up what happened to @entity6 , he has been struggling to put thoughts of the risks to one side when it comes to his own batting			1
‘ it ’s been a big challenge to try to put the memories that are very much in the front of my mind — very recent — to move them back a bit in my mind and trust what i do as a batsman			2
i know everyone ’s going to be in the same boat			0
‘ @entity95 is a hell of a lot easier than batting because you have to make sure you hold your nerve while guys are steaming in			0
’ @entity7 players will wear @entity102 on their shirts in the first test against @entity8 in tribute to @entity6 @entity31 admitted to feeling apprehensive about facing bouncers in the nets over the past couple of days , but said it got easier the more he batted — hence why he stayed in the nets half an hour longer than anyone else on sunday			1
‘ there was initially ( some apprehension ) , no doubt			0
but i ’ve got more comfortable with just reacting to what i see and trusting my skill			0
he added : ‘ you know that if at any stage you get a ball and you get unlucky and it hits you in the wrong spot it can cause some serious damage			0
‘ i knew i had to confront it from day one when i went in , and every day that i ’ve gone in i ’ve felt more comfortable			0
’ captain @entity124 looks set to lead @entity1 after coming through a fitness test over the weekend			1
he batted with purpose in the nets on sunday , having been struggling with a recurrence of his hamstring injury			0
the @entity7 team continue their preparations for the four - test series against @entity8 his inclusion will give added poignancy to the opening day of the test match after being such a figure of support for the @entity6 family and delivering the most heartfelt and tearful of tributes			1
given the emotional burden @entity124 has shouldered , he has been excused from the captain ’s traditional eve - of - test press conference			2
that job has gone to @entity145 , @entity1 ’s chief aggressor with the ball , who roughed up the @entity149 batsmen during the last @entity151 series			2
there has been an international debate over the use of the bouncer in the wake of @entity6 ’s death but @entity31 is in no doubt that the @entity7 will go hard at @entity8			1
‘ we ’ve played our best cricket when we are aggressive			0
aggressive with bat and ball but especially with the ball , as we were during the last @entity151 series			0
that ’s not going to change because that ’s when we are at our absolute best			0
’ @entity166 will host the first of four tests between @entity1 and @entity8 before @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity38 @entity172 chief executive @entity171 said he hoped the @entity36 will be an opportunity for supporters to pay tribute to @entity6			1
‘ soon after arriving in @entity175 became a crowd favourite , ’ he said			0
‘ this is an opportunity for those who embraced him so fondly to say their goodbye			0
’ when the 63 seconds of applause bursts out at the @entity11 it will be hard to avoid the thought that his score that day at the @entity38 would surely have seen him recalled to the test squad for the start of this series			2
perhaps , instead , this @entity36 will signify the start of a healing process for those players who were closest to @entity6			2
as silent mourning is replaced by ringing applause , a group of men will begin the hardest game of cricket they are likely to play in their lives			0
@entity7 captain @entity124 practises in the nets at the @entity11 ahead of the clash with @entity8			2

@entity1 will face @entity8 in their first test since the death of @entity6
@entity31 said preparing for it has been a huge challenge
@entity31 said the team will be battling their emotions and inner demons
