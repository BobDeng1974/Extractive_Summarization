@entity2 's 24 - hour drinking laws have left @entity3 ' awash ' with cheap alcohol and plagued by late night violence , experts warned last night			1
@entity7 figures reveal there are now a record number of trouble hotspots – with 208 neighbourhoods officially classified as being ' saturated ' with problem pubs or bars			1
to the fury of medical experts , there is also a record number of supermarkets , petrol stations and convenience stores selling booze around the clock – fuelling harmful drinking			1
the @entity39 had pledged to end the chaos caused by @entity2 's licensing reforms , which occurred in 2005 in the face of fierce opposition from police and @entity45 , as well as a @entity47 campaign			1
but the powers they gave town halls to limit opening hours in problem areas and make bars and clubs pay for extra policing have proved a spectacular flop			2
by the end of march this year , only one so - called late night levy had been introduced and there was not a single order to restrict early morning alcohol sales			2
last night council leaders demanded a change to the rules – labelling the current powers ' unwieldy , bureaucratic , and extremely costly and time - consuming '			2
health campaigners said one of the most devastating consequences of 24 - hour drinking laws has been shops selling cheap alcohol all day and night			1
of the 7,353 licences in force for round - the - clock opening , more than a quarter ( 2,065 ) were for supermarkets and convenience stores			1
chief constables have since declared 24 - hour drinking a failed ' experiment ' which did not usher in the promised ' café culture ' the total number of premises licensed to sell alcohol is stable at 204,300 , as is the overall number of 24 - hour drinking licences , which stands at 8,200 liver specialist professor sir @entity84 , chairman of the @entity85 , said : ' we are awash with outlets selling cheap drink			1
i do n't think actually the general public is in favour of this and i do n't think they know what to do about it			0
it beggars belief you can buy a bottle of wine at a garage at 2am			0
' the whole direction of policy is in deregulation , to make alcohol an ordinary product just like soap powder rather than realising it is a drug of dependence			0
the problem is supermarkets , convenience stores and petrol stations selling cheap drink			1
' the scale of @entity3 's drinking culture is laid bare by the @entity7 's annual report on alcohol and late night refreshment licensing , slipped out shortly before @entity31			1
the total number of premises licensed to sell alcohol is stable at 204,300 , as is the overall number of 24 - hour drinking licences , which stands at 8,200			1
but the number of supermarkets and shops which never close is up by 5 per cent			1
there has also been an alarming 19 per cent spike in the amount of so - called cumulative impact zones – up from 175 a year ago			2
this means a town centre or neighbourhood is officially considered to be a trouble hotspot which is at ' saturation ' point and can not cope with new premises opening			0
trouble in these areas ranges from fighting and litter to drug dealing , pick - pocketing and robbery			0
many are now found in small , previously quiet towns which used to have few crimes of this nature			0
at the end of march 2007 , when the licensing laws had been relaxed for just over a year , there were only 71 of these zones in the @entity3			2
to the fury of medical experts , there is also a record number of supermarkets , petrol stations and convenience stores selling booze around the clock – fuelling harmful drinking upon coming to office , the @entity160 promised to limit the worst impact of the change in the law with two new powers : late night levies which would see late - opening problem venues pay more for their licence , and early morning alcohol restriction orders , or @entity170			1
emros enable town halls to prohibit the sale of alcohol for a specified time period between midnight and 6am in the whole or part of their area			0
yet , despite being launched amid great fanfare , there was not a single @entity182 in force at the end of march this year			0
and at the end of that month there was just a single late night levy , which raised £ 300,000 from pub and bar owners in @entity190 ; a city notorious for drunken late night scenes			0
cllr @entity193 , chairman of the @entity195 's @entity194 , said : ' councils are being hamstrung by the current systems for implementing early morning restriction orders and late night levies , which are unwieldy , bureaucratic , and extremely costly and time - consuming			2
' local authorities are forced to hold numerous hearings , and call scores of witnesses as a result of multiple representations by the alcohol industry			0
however , residents – who do not have access to expensive lawyers – struggle to be heard because of the number and complexity of forms they must fill out			0
' late night levies must be introduced across councils ' entire areas , which makes it extremely difficult to target them effectively			0
' @entity7 figures reveal there are now a record number of trouble hotspots – with 208 neighbourhoods officially classified as being ' saturated ' with problem pubs or bars the @entity47 – backed by senior police , ambulance staff and judges – opposed the 2005 relaxation of the licensing laws			1
chief constables have since declared 24 - hour drinking a failed ' experiment ' which did not usher in the promised ' café culture '			1
last year , the @entity234 ( @entity234 ) said the situation was so bad that private sector - run ' drunk tanks ' should be introduced to care for the inebriated			2
last night , @entity2 's shadow home office spokesman @entity239 said : ' @entity241 's record on alcohol is one of broken promises and failed policies			1
' crime prevention minister @entity246 said : ' the government is taking a range of action to address the £ 11billion a year that alcohol - fuelled crime and disorder costs @entity253 and @entity254			0
' we have given local areas more powers to deal with alcohol - related disorder , and i have recently written to local authorities and police and crime commissioners to remind them of these important measures			0
' we have also lowered the evidence threshold for decision - making to make it easier for licensing authorities and the police to review , revoke or impose conditions on licences			0
' seven local authority areas have now decided to introduce a [ late night ] levy			0

@entity7 figures show *shocking* results of the 24 - hour drinking laws
@entity2 's laws , introduced in 2005 , left @entity3 ' awash ' with cheap booze
record number of supermarkets and shops selling booze round the clock
also number of takeaways servicing bars has hit all - time high of 87,000
