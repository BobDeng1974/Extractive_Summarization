do n't forget to flush : doogal demonstrates the @entity1 , which allows cats to use the toilet sick of clearing out your cat 's litterbox ? an inventor has come up with a pet accessory that can train a cat to use a toilet like a human			1
@entity12 came up with the novel idea after watching a comical scene in the @entity16 film meet the @entity17 , showing a cat sharing a lavatory with one of the characters			2
the 48 - year - old @entity22 made a special training device out of plant pots and toilet seats and successfully taught her own moggy , @entity27 , to use the bathroom like a human			0
she abolished the need for a litter tray and has since developed her makeshift prototype into a product that is now sold sold worldwide			0
the @entity1 is a set of different sized plastic ' seats ' that are used to train cats , and starts with a litter tray on the floor near the toilet			1
it is then placed on top of the toilet seat and eventually swapped for different size discs with holes in the middle that fit with the rim of the lid , before being removed altogether			0
the @entity50 resident said : ' a few years ago i bought a little blue @entity53 kitten we named @entity27			0
' not long after @entity27 's arrival i soon got sick of his smelly litter tray and his frequent , toilet - going ways			0
as soon as i cleaned it he would go straight in and use it again			0
' a girlfriend and i went went to see meet the @entity17 which featured a cat called mr @entity62 , who shared the toilet with @entity65 in one funny scene			1
' this was the eureka moment for me and the genesis behind the invention of @entity1			1
' cats bury their waste to hide the smell , which in the wild can attract predators			0
' a toilet - trained cat whose waste disappears into the water of the toilet bowl would experience the same psychological satisfaction as this			2
the @entity1 is a set of different size plastic ' seats ' and starts with a litter tray on the floor near the toilet the litter tray is then placed on top of the toilet seat and eventually swapped for different sized discs with holes in the middle that fit with the rim of the lid ' the @entity1 works best with kittens as they have fewer bad habits to unlearn , but basically any healthy cat that can use a litter tray can be trained to use the toilet			1
' once a cat is trained it can use any toilet , but will naturally favour the one it was trained on			2
" the @entity1 set costs about Â£ 40 and is available to buy via @entity12 's website www.litterkwitter.com or from pet shops across the @entity117			2
@entity119 friend : @entity12 and her cat @entity120 , whose extensive toilet needs made her the perfect test subject for the @entity1			1
