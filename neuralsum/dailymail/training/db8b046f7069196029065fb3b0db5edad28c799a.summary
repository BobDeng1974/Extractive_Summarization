by @entity1 reporter published : 17:27 est , 19 september 2013 updated : 13:13 est , 20 september 2013 victim : @entity3 was found murdered in the basement of her home in 1996 a @entity7 reporter has filed a lawsuit to have the indictment made against the parents of slain @entity3 made public more than a decade after it was originally filed			1
the 1996 murder of the 6 - year - old beauty pageant contestant made headlines for years and the latest revelation in the saga was that one of the grand juries called in to examine the case originally felt that the girl 's parents were in part responsible for her death			2
back in 1999 a @entity7 grand jury voted to indict the @entity25 on charges of child abuse resulting in death , a felony that can carry up to 48 years in prison			1
sources , including members of the grand jury , told the @entity34 in january that the @entity35 at the time , @entity36 , refused to sign the indictment vote without giving a public explanation			2
instead , the indictment remained sealed and @entity40 and @entity41 were never charged			0
now a local journalist and a press advocacy group have filed a lawsuit asserting that the indictment should be made public in the interest in government accountability			0
' the plaintiffs believe ... that the indictment is a criminal justice record that reflects official action by the grand jury , and accordingly that it is subject to mandatory disclosure upon request , ' attorney @entity56 wrote in the formal complaint , as reported in the @entity34			2
cold case : @entity41 and @entity60 , the parents of murdered beauty queen @entity3 , were indicted by a grand jury over her death , but prosecutors refused to press charges , it has been revealed ' last picture ' : @entity3 with her mother , apparently on the morning of her death			1
her parents remained suspects in the murder until finally being exonerated in 2008 the indictment and ensuing lawsuit are just the latest bend in the legal back - and - forth between the criminal justice system and the @entity25			1
no charges were ever actually filed against @entity41 or @entity76 , and the same goes for @entity3 's older brother @entity77 who allegedly slept through her kidnapping and subsequent murder in the family 's basement on december 26			0
mrs @entity3 died after a battle with ovarian cancer in 2006 and @entity41 has since remarried			0
in 2008 , following the testing of previously unknown dna found on @entity3 's underwear , the @entity84 formally ruled out any connection between @entity3 's immediate family members and the murder			0
a new district attorney reopened the case in 2009 , and it still remains open to this day			0
horrific : @entity3 was found with her wrists tied above her head and duct tape over her mouth basement case : this 1996 police video shows the basement hours after @entity3 's body was discovered christmas day , 1996 : parents of six - year - old @entity3 receive a ransom note demanding $ 118,000 @entity104 , 1996 : @entity3 found bludgeoned to death in the basement of her home in @entity108 , @entity7 @entity109 quickly placed her parents , @entity41 and @entity60 , under an ' umbrella of suspicion ' but they were never formally named as suspects detectives were later criticised for losing focus of the crime scene and other leads by concentrating on the family 2003 : dna taken from the victim 's clothes suggests the family were not involved 2006 : @entity60 dies of ovarian cancer august 2006 : former teacher @entity3 reportedly confesses to the murder while being held on child pornography charges			1
but no murder charge brought after his @entity118 found not to match that on @entity3 's body 2008 : @entity108 district attorney 's office clears parents of any wrongdoing and issues apology february 2009 : @entity133 takes the case back from the district attorney to reopen the investigation			1

@entity3 , 6 , found bludgeoned to death at home on christmas day , 1996
parents remained suspects before finally being exonerated of crime in 2008
now sources reveal grand jury voted in 1999 to indict them on charges of child abuse resulting in death
but district attorney refused to sign vote and never revealed the result
