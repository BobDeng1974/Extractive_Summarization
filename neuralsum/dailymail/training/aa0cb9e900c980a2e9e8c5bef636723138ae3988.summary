but when the animals are contained in a zoo enclosure and you are firing down on them from behind a safety barrier - it is a little easier to be brave			0
these lions certainly looked less than pleased when they were pelted with snow by laughing visitors , including children , at @entity14 in @entity15 , eastern @entity16			1
helpless : the two lions cowered together as snow was hurled down into their enclosure by the crowd above at @entity14 in @entity15 , eastern @entity16 bullying : a group of visitors - some just children - bombarded the lions with snow from the side of the pen frightened : the lioness , clearly scared , ducks down as snowballs fly past her the attack was reportedly launched by one young man , who began to take aim at the big cats with a barrage of snow and ice			1
the attack clearly frightened the helpless animals , with the lioness swiftly taking cover under a wooden plank			2
the male line used a tree trunk as cover , with both eyes fixed on the visitors , as the missiles rained into the enclosure , @entity43 reports			0
the man apparently laughed as he hurled the snow , with a group of other visitors , including a number of children , also starting to take aim at the lions			1
debris : the lions look at the ground as fragments of snow and ice land around them glare : the two lions look furious as they continued to be targeted ( left ) while the lion later took a direct hit to his head ( right ) fierce : the lion finally loses his temper and lets out a furious roar at their tormentors one of them used large chunks of snow and threw them down with all of his strength , according to the website			0
the frightened lions took shelter together in the corner of their pen as they tried to escape the new onslaught			0
the male lion roared in anger at his tormentors as they began to stroll away			0
sadly the lions were not the only animals to be pelted with snow , with some of the crowd also pelting the zoo 's alpacas , monkeys , a giraffe , a tiger and other creatures .			1
