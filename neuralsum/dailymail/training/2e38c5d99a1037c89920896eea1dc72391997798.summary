by @entity0 as if alcohol was n't already easy enough to come by , the @entity1 has reportedly approved a new product called @entity4 , an alcoholic powder that comes in flavors including @entity7 and @entity8			1
curiously , @entity4 's current website is light on details but the urge to ' drink responsibly ' does not appear to be among the company 's top priorities			1
' maybe you ’re a college football fan			0
so many stadiums do n’t even serve alcohol			2
what ’s that about ; watching football without drinking ? ! that ’s almost criminal			0
bring @entity21 in and enjoy the game			1
' get drunk fast : powdered alcohol comes in seven different varieties and will be on sale by the fall @entity4 ... because liquid alcohol is n't always convenient			1
since @entity4 is a powder , it makes it easy to enjoy a cocktail just about anywhere perhaps even more bizarrely , as well as adding the alcoholic power to water , the site also suggests that @entity21 can also be poured over food			1
' @entity4 on almost any dish and give it an extra kick			0
some of our favorites are the @entity8 in guacamole , rum on a bbq sandwich , @entity7 on a salad and vodka on eggs in the morning to start your day off right			0
' there are even some rudimentary cooking instructions : ' remember , you have to add @entity49 a dish is cooked as the alcohol will burn off if you cook with it ... and that defeats the whole purpose			2
' the @entity1 has approved seven versions of this powdered alcohol within the past few days			1
the alcohol content is around the 60 % range and the power can even be snorted			2
the company wrote on its site : ' you ’ll get drunk almost instantly because the alcohol will be absorbed so quickly in your nose			1
' party on ! the company had stated that @entity21 would make it easier to consume alcohol where it is normally banned , such as at ball games @entity21 will come in seven different flavors and it simply needs to be added to water in order for the boozing to begin			1
a number of bloggers are treating the announcement with a healthy degree of skepticism			0
' the person that pushed this through must be very patient or lucky and / or good			0
the product seems highly likely to raise a large number of legal issues and controversies , ' writes patent lawyer @entity87 on @entity89			2
patent applications are kept confidential by the government until they either issue as a patent or are published			0
@entity21 describes its product as ' @entity96 , ' which means that they have recently filed a patent application			1
start the day of right ! sprinkle a kamikaze on your breakfast cereal perhaps recognising that such a marketing strategy risked causing controversy , and even possible legal issues , @entity21 has recently removed the original copy from its website and issued a clarification : ' we were caught off guard with the release of some of our labels by the @entity1			1
as a result , people visited this website that we thought was under the radar because we had not made a formal announcement of @entity21			1
' clearly , this site is n't finished			0
thus , the verbiage that was copied was still in draft mode and the labels that were up were incorrect			0
so please disregard what is being printed as a result of information taken from this site			0
' what we can say now is that we hope the product will be used in a responsible and legal manner			2
being in compliance with all @entity131 and @entity132 laws is very important to us			0
@entity4 will only be sold through establishments that are licensed to sell liquor			0
' powdered alcohol is not a new concept			1
such products are already being sold in other countries including @entity139 , @entity140 , and the @entity141			0
according to some , alcohol laws would in general only apply to liquids			2
this would mean that powder - based alcoholic beverages could be sold to minors and that the powder would be exempt from alcohol tax and laws , as is the case with certain products in the @entity141 .			2

@entity21 can easily be *sneaked* into *sporting* events
the powdered alcohol can also be used in drinks or sprinkled on food
company aims to have the product for sale by the fall
