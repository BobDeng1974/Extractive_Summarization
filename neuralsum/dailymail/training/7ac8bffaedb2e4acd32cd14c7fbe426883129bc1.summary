she was always so aggressive			0
it was awful for us neighbours but those kids are the real victims			1
‘ i used to phone social services on a weekly basis and ring the police around three times a week trying to stop the abuse but nothing was ever done			0
it might not be physical abuse but it 's still abuse and it was constant - even going on right through the night			1

' @entity96 ' : neighbour @entity85 , 52 , was one of those driven to complain by @entity14 's tirades ‘ we could n't sit in our living room for almost eight months because of the noise and so i felt like the heart had been ripped out of the home			1
she had absolutely no respect for herself , her kids , her home or her neighbours			2
’ mrs @entity26 , who has three daughters , said her family were forced to use the cellar as a living room because of the noise - and on some nights would even be forced to sleep there			1
she said : ‘ she has robbed us of our family life			0
since the day she moved in the noise started and it never seemed to stop			2
we 'd get half an hour of peace if we were lucky and then it would start again			0
‘ she was even verbally abusive to me and if i was in the front garden or street she 'd shout and say she was going to kill me and she 'd bang on the walls with a hammer			2
i never spoke to her so it was completely unprovoked			0
‘ we could n't use our living room when she lived there because we could hear all her vile language and insults to her kids so we 'd use our cellar as a living room			0
@entity130 : this is the former home of @entity14 in @entity12 , @entity13 , where she brought misery to her neighbours ‘ we 'd sleep in our bedrooms but on some occasions because we 'd get woken up in the early hours of the morning and would n't be able to get back to sleep for the noise so we 'd sleep in the cellar			1
‘ when her baby would cry she 'd just scream , shout and swear at it to be quiet			0
it was just a vile onslaught of racial and homophobic abuse against her children			2
i ca n't even begin to imagine what they were going through			0
’ mrs @entity26 said her 11 - year - old daughter , who has learning difficulties , would get distressed by the abuse and her husband was struggling to work			1
‘ two of my daughters , who are aged just 11 and 15 , would have to listen to the filth being spouted			0
it was bad enough for me to listen to it but children should n't have to listen to that			2
‘ my youngest daughter has learning difficulties and so it was even harder for her to understand what was going on			0
she 'd get really distressed by all the shouting and would often get upset about it			0
‘ my other daughter would spend most of the time out of the house to try and escape it			0
my husband works at a bank and he has a long drive to get to work each morning			0
‘ he was severely sleep - deprived for months and was struggling to do his job			1
