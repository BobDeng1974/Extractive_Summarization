' @entity21 ' or ' @entity22 ' , as he was nicknamed , was an immensely likeable and also humble , understated and hardworking team mate for the @entity16 , @entity16 and @entity23			0
twenty20 matches : 1 runs : 6 average : 6			0

his achievements as a young cricketer - he was due to celebrate his 26th birthday this sunday - include making 26 first class centuries ; as @entity4 coach @entity59 pointed out this week while flying back to @entity64 to see @entity0 , at his age , @entity59 had only made one			1
@entity0 made a total of 15,789 runs in his first class career and many of those were ones or twos - as he laughingly recalled some years ago , he was n't a big scorer of fours or sixes			2
the left - handed opener was the son of @entity79 , who cleared a patch on his farm for young @entity82 to practise cricket , and mother @entity84 , who is of @entity87 origin			1
growing up with sister , @entity89 , and brother , @entity91 , as a teenager he often helped out hauling heavy bunches of bananas for the family business			0

as a 20 - year - old , he won the the @entity126 , accepting the award in @entity128 during the @entity130 presentations in february 2009			0
since @entity0 ' stunning 2009 test debut at the age of 20 in @entity133 , he had been dropped five times , which might have defeated a less determined player			2
but despite controversies over his style , technique and his off - field activities with the friends he keeps , @entity0 always plugged on , taking on the verbal bouncers along with those on the field			2
@entity0 stands before the @entity16 flag for a portrait during a @entity149 players ' camp in 2010 @entity0 poses with his award after being named @entity126 in @entity128 for 2009 @entity0 waiting to take his turn to bat in the nets at a practice session at the @entity155 in @entity156 in 2010 cricket players embrace at @entity158 after visiting @entity0 following his tragic head injury he was friends with @entity161 , the controversial boxer 's colourful manager , @entity113 and rugby league player @entity114 , who attended his matches			1

@entity0 was selected to play the @entity106 series in @entity186 , but was dropped when the @entity188 bowlers pitched short balls to him in an effort to exploit his weaknesses			1
but what he may have lacked occasionally in technique , he made up for with heart and drive			0
in the 2010/2011 @entity198 series , selectors ignored him except as an injury replacement for @entity200 in the final test ; he toured @entity202 in late 2011 and scored 126 in the third test			0
but in the @entity206 tour that summer , poor performances saw him dropped and he signed a contract to play county cricket for @entity112 in @entity186 and work on his technique			0
in january 2011 , @entity0 was stunned to be accused of ' cheating ' by @entity188 cricket legend sir @entity211 after being bowled a bouncer in the @entity213 by @entity214 and staying on the field after what was initially thought to be a catch			2

last october , @entity0 made his twenty20 international cricket debut for @entity4 in the @entity238 , in the same match as @entity240 made his			0
before his injury at the @entity169 on tuesday , he was up for selection in next week 's test against @entity244 at the @entity245 in @entity246			1
he had played 26 test matches and @entity16 selector and cricketing legend @entity248 described @entity0 as ' a hell of a good batsman '			2
