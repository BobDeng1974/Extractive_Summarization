a ' @entity1 ' assistant that can translate any language , answer any question , and never needs to be taken out of your pocket has been hailed as @entity7 's future by one of its leading engineers			1
@entity11 , @entity7 vice-president and senior search engineer , and the man who wrote the firm 's search algorithm , said that the company has been inspired by sci - fi series @entity1 to develop the ' ubiquitous computing ' concept , where gadgets woven into users ' daily lives seamlessly respond to questions			1
' why should someone stop their conversation because they 're missing a tiny piece of information that you need to take that conversation further ? ' said mr @entity11			0
' you have to pull out your phone , you have to unlock the phone , you have to type - already you have lost valuable seconds and the conversation has become unnatural and awkward			2
' i would make a bold prediction that in the next three to five years you will have a @entity1 assistant , with a lot more capability than your phone has now			1
' we have built baby steps of this already			0
' in future , answers to questions could be delivered to users through devices for the living room and kitchen appliances that respond to spoken commands			0
' what if i ask a question and the answer pops up , on my @entity34 or on the tv or maybe even on the family refrigerator ? " he said			1
' then we can go on with the conversation			0
' it will make the conversation richer			2
@entity71 from @entity73 's auction rooms , @entity74 , displays a tricorder prop from @entity76 , a @entity1 film			1
the iconic tv show predicted a range of technologies which are already being developed , such as universal translation and advanced medical scanners			2
it featured replicators , which can make a perfect copy of anything - not unlike the 3d printers that are already available and expected to become commonplace			1
ships in the series often used cloaking devices to shield themselves from prying enemy eyes - a technology which is slowly becoming reality			2
the show also predicted the emergence of smartphones - with the famous ' tricorder ' being a handheld , internet connected computer			0
it also featured human - like robots , which are already being used in some environments , and are expected to become common [ place in the coming years			1
however , many more of @entity1 's inventions , including ' warp speed ' space travel and teleportation are yet to arrive			1
however , earlier this year , @entity108 reported that photons had been teleported 89 miles , between @entity110 and @entity111 in a groundbreaking experiment that could one day lead to the iconic phrase ' @entity115 me up , @entity117 , ' being used for real			0
@entity11 , who describes his job as ' being in charge of the world 's search ' , has previously said he has a simple dream - to built the @entity1 communicator he saw on his family 's black - and - white tv while growing up in @entity126			1
' the key to this is when you can have a @entity129 , where you can say , ' @entity7 , tell me how @entity131 made his money ? , ' he told the @entity133			0
' you can seek any knowledge on demand			0
' how much more productive would humanity be if we can achieve this ? ' today i feel more excited about my dream , it is almost within grasp , " says @entity11			0
however , @entity7 is not the only firm hoping to develop a personal assistant			2
@entity146 's @entity145 assistant @entity144 can perform many functions of the mobile phone - including sending text messages - simply by responding to the user 's voice			2
the @entity145 and @entity153 maker also has a patent on a head - mounted display system using a pair of glasses fitted with small screens			1
mr @entity11 said that there were still hurdles to overcome , and that computers will need to understand the intricacies of conversational speech			0
he gave the example of a discussion of football , with someone asking ' how are they doing ? '			0
while a computer would be baffled , humans understand it refers to the team			0
the inspiration for @entity34 ? @entity1 's lt @entity174			1
today the firm said @entity1 is the inspiration behind much of its work .			1

firm hopes to make its head mounted @entity34 project part of *vision*
@entity185 ' @entity1 ' assistant is already being developed , with a finished version 3 - 5 years away
