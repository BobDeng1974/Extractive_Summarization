by @entity0 , @entity1 published : 09:36 est , 22 november 2012 updated : 20:15 est , 22 november 2012 more to do : road safety minister @entity3 said while the 2011 drink - drive fatality figures are second lowest ever , he wants to reduce them further drink - drivers who fail a breath test by a small amount could be stripped of their right to a blood or urine test			1
ministers aim to remove the statutory right to a second test when a breath test reading is just above the legal limit			2
this will close the loophole giving drivers time to sober up while they wait for a blood or urine sample to be taken			2
some 8 per cent of those arrested for drink - driving opt for a second chance blood test			1
a quarter of those who have done so in a police station where there is no on - hand doctor have escaped prosecution			0
a government consultation document , published by road safety minister @entity3 , says ministers aim to ‘ streamline enforcement against drink - driving ’			1
they also plan to give police the option of skipping the secondary breath test , usually conducted at a police station			0
' i am determined to make the jobs of those who deal with drink - drivers easier and less bureaucratic so that bringing offenders to justice is not left to chance , ' mr @entity3 said			1
currently , suspected drink - drivers are given a preliminary test and must then go to the police station for a second test on a breathalyser machine whose results are reliable enough to be used in court as evidence			1
the government is hoping to roll out sophisticated mobile roadside ‘ evidential ’ breath test devices , which will remove the need for a trip to the police station			2
these devices are not currently in use but are expected to receive @entity60 approval next year			0
the report says : ‘ this would mean that an officer can conduct an evidential breath test in places other than at a police station or hospital , including at the roadside , without the need for a preliminary screening test			2
’ similar roadside test devices for drug - drivers are also awaiting approval			1
mr @entity3 said : ‘ we have made great progress in tackling drink - drivers and the 2011 fatality figure for drink - and - drive accidents is the second lowest ever recorded			1
‘ however , last year , 280 people died ( in these types of accident ) , ruining the lives of families up and down the country , so more needs to be done to eradicate this menace			0
’ he said : ‘ that is why we are taking forward a package of measures to streamline enforcement against drink - driving			0
' @entity90 plans : a police officer holds a breath test kit			2
the government plans to crackdown on drunk motorists who use legal loopholes by choosing a blood or urine sample while they sober up currently , drivers who record less than 50 microgrammes of alcohol per 100ml of breath have the right to demand a blood or urine test - despite being over the legal limit of 35 microgrammes per 100ml			1
this is known as the statutory option			0
it dates back to the original introduction of earlier ‘ blow in the bag ’ breathalyser technology when there were concerns over reliability			0
the government also wants to give registered health care professionals – and not just doctors - greater roles in testing drink - drivers and drug - drivers			1
they will be able to take evidential blood samples in hospitals and to assess whether a driver may be impaired because of drug			0
ministers say this will enable tests to be carried out more swiftly , easing the pressure on doctors who are currently the only professionals with the authority to carry out the tests			0
other proposals within the plans include further research into the process used to decide whether a driver banned due to drink - driving can regain their licence			0
there are also plans for the greater use of powers to seize vehicles to get the most dangerous and irresponsible motorists off the road , including drink - drivers			1
the moves follow the recent review of drink and drug - driving by sir @entity152 who recommended the removal of the right to demand a blood or urine test as evidence showed people were using it as a delaying tactic			1
the government believes that improvements in the accuracy of technology means that this option is no longer necessary			0
@entity166 director professor @entity165 said : ' the law is full of unintended consequences and it seems correct to close a loophole which allows drink - drivers to escape rightful prosecution			2
' in future the roadside technology is up to an adequate evidential standard then this is the place to determine if wrong has been done			0

statutory right to a blood test may be removed under new plans *announced* by road safety minister @entity3
needs introduction of more advanced breath - test *equipment* before it gets go ahead
new roadside tests for drug - drivers could also soon be approved
thorough tests - that can be used in court - could soon be done on roadside
