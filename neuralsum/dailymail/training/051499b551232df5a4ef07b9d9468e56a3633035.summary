long depicted as the rootin ' - tootin ' capital of @entity3 gun culture , @entity0 is one of the few states with an outright ban on the open carry of handguns			1

' of the states that ban open carry , @entity0 easily has the most gun - friendly reputation most of the country already allows some form of open carry of handguns , according to the @entity58 , a @entity59 - based group advocating gun control legislation			1
but @entity0 , @entity59 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 , which make up more than a third of the @entity3 population and include six of its seven largest population centers , do not			2
large urban areas have traditionally had the strictest controls on weapons in public because of concerns over guns in crowds and crime control , said @entity78 law professor @entity77 , author of ' gunfight : the @entity80 in @entity3			0
' he said it 's ' pretty surprising ' that @entity0 still has an open carry ban that dates to the 1870s			1
' we 've been regulating guns in the interest of public safety , even in places like @entity0 , since the founding , ' @entity77 said			0
' the battle over open carry of guns in public remains one of the most heated in the gun debate today			1

concealed handguns are allowed inside the @entity116 , where license holders can bypass metal detectors			0
but @entity0 still insists handguns be kept out of sight			2
