@entity0 once overheard someone ask @entity2 if he could speak @entity3			1
‘ he was born in @entity3 ! ’ laughs the @entity5 youth coach , highlighting the irony of the 18 - year - old ’s decision to represent the county of his parents ’ birth			1
@entity2 was born in @entity12 , a holiday town near @entity13 , and could have been forgiven for ensconcing himself in @entity15 ’s fabled youth set - up — it is not like they were n’t interested			2
who could have blamed him ? it would arguably have accelerated his technical development , perhaps even burnished his standing at @entity22 , where he has made impressive progress through their academy			2
@entity25 has impressed for @entity22 and looks set for a bright future the 18 - year - old was born in @entity3 but has pledged his allegiance towards @entity5 @entity29 says that he sees a lot of similarities between @entity2 and a young @entity32 the influence of his patriotic parents , dad @entity35 and mum @entity36 — from @entity37 — must be acknowledged and it is significant that @entity2 speaks in a @entity40 accent			1
he returns regularly to visit relatives and has an emotional attachment strong enough to board a plane to @entity5 whenever his @entity22 contemporaries head to @entity45 , the @entity3 national team ’s football factory in @entity22 , during international breaks			1
as a young teenager , he was around @entity5 ’s under - 16 @entity50 squad			1
as he grew physically , so did the @entity52 ’s involvement , spearheaded by @entity29 , who visited @entity22 to check on his progress			1
there , he found a player very much part of the @entity3 giants ’ development plans			2
‘ it ’s not really certain whether @entity2 is a no 9 or 10 , ’ explained @entity29 , the former @entity52 performance chief			2
‘ so @entity22 told me : “ he is a nine - and - a - half			2
we love him , but he is a strange player			0
” i had the same situation with @entity32 when i was under - 19 coach of @entity65			2
it was difficult to position him			0
i see a lot of similarities with @entity2			0
they have a similar style of running and body shape , creativity in and around the box , and the awareness to score goals			0
but there is still a big gap between where @entity2 is now and @entity32			2
’ @entity29 has never been slow to make the @entity32 comparison but he is not predicting that @entity2 ’s career will follow the same trajectory as the @entity81 ’s , only that there are points of connection , both physically and technically			1
@entity2 is tall — just over 6ft — and has a similarly languid , straight - backed style to @entity32 ; he is also technically adept and good in the air with a strong tactical awareness			1
the latter aspect is picked up on by @entity0 , who has worked with @entity2 in national youth squads and himself moved to @entity3 for a year to study coaching			1
but @entity29 does concede that @entity2 has a long way to go if he is to emulate @entity92 ‘ because @entity2 grew up in @entity3 , he ’s always played a continental style of football , where the game is played at a slower pace and there is an emphasis on tactics , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ that approach is evident all the way through in @entity3			0
from small - sided games , young players are taught to be tactically aware and that everything has a knock - on effect			0
being immersed in that way for his whole life has had a big effect on @entity2			0
it ’s in his dna			0
’ @entity2 ’s football intelligence has shone through in this season ’s @entity111 , with goals home and away to @entity115 , another in a 3 - 2 loss to @entity118 , and two assists , helping @entity22 to finish top of their group and ensure a last - 16 place			1
his performances have also reportedly led to interest from @entity118 and @entity125			0
for a flash of his technical ability , a @entity129 search for ‘ @entity2 backheel ’ brings up his exquisite assist for the @entity132 a side earlier this month			0
@entity2 ( pictured in action for @entity5 under 17s two years ago ) wants to play for his parents ' homeland @entity5 fans will have to be patient , though			1
he has yet to kick a ball in senior football and there remains a yawning chasm between @entity143 and the @entity22 first - team squad , though @entity2 has at least got to mix with world - class talents such as @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 by travelling with them on @entity152 trips ( the @entity111 schedule tries to mirror its senior equivalent ’s fixtures )			1
a progression to @entity22 ’s reserve team — @entity158 — in 2015 would see him work under @entity159 and @entity160 in @entity161 while @entity22 are quietly confident @entity2 has the ability and attitude to go all the way , the next 18 months are crucial			1
while @entity2 is hardly burdened by an inferiority complex , there have been no rumblings of arrogance or impetuosity that often accompany the emergence of a prodigious talent			0
‘ i would pay him the compliment of saying he is the opposite [ of how people might expect a @entity22 youngster to behave ] , ’ says @entity0			0
‘ often players at big clubs are now allowed to act like that			0
’ @entity29 agrees : ‘ he ’s a cool guy			0
he knows he ’s not a star yet			0

@entity2 is one of @entity22 *'s* bright stars of the future
the 18 - year - old *reminds* @entity29 of a young @entity32
@entity2 has opted to play for @entity5 rather than @entity3
