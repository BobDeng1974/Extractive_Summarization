to follow @entity9 's progress visit www.facebook.com\steppingforwardforjoseph @entity9 and his family can be supported in their fundraising at @entity165 @entity15 is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity ( increased muscle tone ) in the lower limbs			1
the lower vertebrae are opened to reveal the spinal cord which contains the neurones of the central nervous system			0
these neurones ( bundles of nerve fibres ) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the body			0
electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves			0
this process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles are identified and cut			2
due to the size of the nerves and rootlets , this is a very precise procedure and therefore the surgery can last several hours and requires a general anaesthetic			1
many months of physiotherapy are needed after the surgery to retrain the legs			2
