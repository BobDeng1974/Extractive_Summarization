by @entity0 published : 04:47 est , 28 march 2012 updated : 04:52 est , 28 march 2012 new terrestrial planets are believed to be forming around a neighbouring baby solar system – including a giant planet about the same distance to its host star as @entity6 is to the @entity7 planets there may even contain mountains made entirely of diamonds , thanks to an abundance of carbon			2
the central star , @entity16 , is twice as large as our sun and astronomers using @entity22 ’s @entity21 telescope discovered that it ’s surrounded by a disk of extremely carbon - rich gas			1
@entity22 ’s @entity27 told nature : ‘ if carbon - rich worlds are forming in @entity16 , they might be covered with tar and smog , with mountains made of giant diamonds			1
life on such a planet is not implausible , but it would certainly be exotic			0
’ nursery : @entity16 is surrounded by carbon rich gas and dust with planets very likely forming and growing from asteroid collisions the disk of dust and gas surrounding the star , which lies 70 light years away near the constellation @entity48 and is only 12 million years old , is produced by collisions between and evaporation of asteroids and comets			1
debris discs are a bigger version of the zodiacal dust in our @entity56			0
the @entity16 disc was the first to be imaged - as early as 1984 - and remains the best - studied system			1
lurking monster : an infrared image of @entity16 showing the location of the giant planet @entity16 b young planets could be growing as asteroids bombard them and may even be acquiring atmospheres from the impact of water or ice - rich space rocks			2
one planet , @entity16 b , has already been verified by @entity74 astronomers using the @entity76 's @entity75 – and it ’s a whopper			2
its presence was revealed because the disc was warping in a peculiar way and comets have been detected falling into the star			0
‘ these are indirect , but tell - tale signs that strongly suggest the presence of a massive planet – about eight times as massive as @entity89 - lying between five and ten times the mean @entity91 - @entity7 distance from its host star , about the distance of @entity6 in our @entity56 , ’ said team leader @entity88			0
‘ however , probing the very inner region of the disc , so close to the glowing star , is a most challenging task			0

the central star , @entity16 , is 12 million years old and about twice the size of our sun
