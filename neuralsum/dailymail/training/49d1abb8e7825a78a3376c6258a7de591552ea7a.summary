by @entity1 reporter published : 16:38 est , 23 july 2013 updated : 17:27 est , 25 july 2013 @entity4 police decided against sending a hostage negotiator to the home of the @entity8 family on the morning they were brutally murdered , it has emerged			1
@entity10 was raped and strangled to death and her daughters , @entity14 , 17 , and @entity15 , 11 , were tied to their beds and died when the house in @entity18 was set alight on july 23 , 2007			1
the girls ' father , dr. @entity10 was beaten and tied up but escaped the flames , living to see @entity10 and @entity23 be sentenced to death in 2011 for the murders			0
on the sixth anniversary of the horrific killings , the @entity26 has obtained police calls through law enforcement sources showing that officers with the @entity32 doubted the danger underway at the household			1
torn apart : @entity10 , right , was the only member of the family to escape alive			2
@entity10 was strangled and their daughters @entity14 , 17 , and @entity15 , 11 , were killed in the flames they were also outside the home when the murders were carried out and before the home was burned to the ground , it has emerged			2
police were first alerted to trouble at the house when @entity8 was taken to a @entity49 and forced to withdraw $ 15,000 , where she told the teller she was being held hostage			1
when a police officer went to the bank 23 minutes after the initial 911 call , he told a dispatcher in a recorded phone call that he doubted the accuracy of @entity8 's story			1
' she came into the bank , she tried to get some money out , ' lt @entity60 told the dispatcher			0
' one of the accounts was in her husband 's name , and then she says , " well , my kids are at home tied up "			2
so we do n't know if they really are or if she was just trying to get money out at this point			0
' he added that she had entered the bank alone and appeared calm , and that her captor had said nothing would happen to her as long as she handed over the money			0
the phone calls also include one in which a hostage negotiator , @entity81 , is told he was not needed at the scene			1
@entity84 : @entity10 , left , and @entity23 , right , have been sentenced to death for the murders crime scene : the killers broke into this home in @entity18 and held the family hostage - but the police told a hostage negotiator not to report to the home			1
authorities have not explained why ' i need to know whether you want me in or not , ' he said in a 15 - second conversation with dispatcher @entity99			0
' i am the hostage negotiator and i got paged			0
' @entity99 then asked deputy chief @entity100 if he wanted the negotiator , and @entity99 can be heard telling @entity81 ' not at this time ' before hanging up			0
@entity103 public defender @entity102 , who represented @entity23 , said : ' the fact that a hostage negotiator , listening to what was going on during the dispatch communications , felt compelled to call central police headquarters offering his assistance and then being turned away is shocking			0
' @entity99 then received a call from @entity112 team member @entity111 , who asks whether they should start suiting up and head to the scene - but @entity99 said officers said they would call on them if they were needed			2
ten minutes later , @entity111 called back to say they were going there anyway			0
also shocking is how the police have never performed a review of the incident			1
looking forward : five years after losing his family , dr @entity8 married @entity125 last year town manager @entity126 would not provide a reason for this , nor one for why the hostage negotiator was told not to go to the home			1
@entity131 , @entity10 's sister , told the @entity26 that authorities have never carried out a review of the incident or their actions			2
' nobody in that department ever looked at what they did or did n't do right or wrong , ' @entity140 said			0
' admit when you make mistakes and do better the next time and save people 's lives			0
' an @entity147 documentary that aired on monday included a timeline that placed police at the house before @entity8 was raped or the house was set on fire .			1

newly - released phone calls reveal that police officers doubted that the @entity8 family were in danger ahead of their deaths in july 2007
timeline shows that police were outside the home at the time of the deaths
@entity18 police have never carried out a review of the incident
