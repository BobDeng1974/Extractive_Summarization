a majority of @entity3 @entity2 justices have signaled support for a @entity6 woman who was denied a job at an @entity8 because she wore a head scarf			1
on wednesday , the nine justices heard a one - hour argument in an appeal brought by the @entity3 @entity13 ( @entity13 ) on behalf of @entity14			1
@entity14 , who was denied a sales job at an @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18 in 2008 when she was 17 , attended the @entity2 in @entity19 for the hearing with her mother			1
it appeared the court 's four liberal justices are likely to vote in @entity14 's favor , while at least one of the court 's conservatives , justice @entity28 , seems set to follow suit			1
a ruling is due by the end of june			2
the justices appeared to side with her taking a stand : @entity14 leaves the court with her mother , @entity40 , and @entity42 @entity41 , general counsel of the @entity3 @entity13 , who brought the lawsuit on her behalf the legal question is whether @entity14 was required to ask the company to accommodate her religious practice			1
@entity8 said she did not ask them to change their policy and so they can not be sued under the 1964 @entity49			1
the company said it has previously granted religious accommodations when they have requested			2
@entity14 was wearing a head scarf , or hijab , at her job interview in 2008 but did not specifically say that , as a @entity6 , she wanted the company to give her a religious accommodation			1
but the assistant manager who interviewed her assumed she was wearing it for religious reasons			2
she was impressed by @entity40 but when she consulted a manager , they did not give her the job			2
the company denied elauf the job on the grounds that wearing the scarf violated its ' look policy ' for members of the sales staff , a policy intended to promote the brand 's @entity71 collegiate image			1
' discrimination ' : @entity14 , who now works for @entity74 , failed to get a job at an @entity8 store in @entity18 in 2008 , when she was 17 , because her headscarf conflicted with their ' look policy ' justice @entity80 said the civil rights law requires certain peopleto be treated differently to other applicants if they have areligious requirement			1
' they do n't have to accommodate a baseball cap			0
they do have to accommodate a yarmulke , ' @entity80 said , in a reference to the cap worn by some @entity92 men			0
justice @entity28 said employers like @entity8 could easily find out if prospective employees need a religious accommodation by simply asking if they are able to abide by work rules			1
he noted that @entity8 had assumed @entity14 would wear the head scarf every day simply because she wore it at the interview			1
' maybe she just had a bad hair day , ' @entity28 said			0
other conservative justices were more skeptical about the government 's arguments			1
chief justice @entity103 speculated that putting the burden on the employee to assess whether a religious accommodation is needed ' may promote stereotypes to a far greater degree ' by requiring interviewers to inquire about applicants ' religious beliefs			0
fighting back : but the company says @entity14 did not ask for a religious accommodation to wear the scarf support : demonstrators gather outside the @entity2 on wednesday to give @entity117 their support @entity6 groups said in a friend - of - the - court brief in @entity121 that employment discrimination against @entity6 iswidespread in the @entity3			1
often , the act of a woman wearing a head scarf is what triggers the discrimination , the brief said			1
the @entity13 has reported that @entity6 file more employment claims about discrimination and the failure to provide religious accommodations than any other religious group			2
groups representing @entity135 , @entity92 and @entity136 also filed court papers backing @entity14			2
the case comes before the top @entity3 court at a time when some @entity142 nations are struggling with culture clashes relating to accommodating local @entity145 populations			0
the @entity3 has not , however , faced the same tensions as some @entity148 countries including @entity149			0
@entity8 has faced other employee lawsuits , including one in which it agreed in 2004 to pay $ 40 million to several thousand minority and female plaintiffs who had accused the company of discrimination			1
the right look : @entity8 is famously strict with the staff it hires and calls them ' models ' @entity14 was applying for a job at an @entity163 as a ' model ' - the term the company uses for its sales staff			1
in 2013 , @entity168 obtained copies of the company 's lengthy ' @entity170 ' , which revealed @entity8 's ' hyper - specific , borderline absurd dress code ' , the website reported			1
the policy is intended to promote the brand 's @entity71 collegiate image			2
' while we respect your individuality , it is important that we maintain a consistent level of dress and grooming that represents what people expect from the @entity8 brand , ' it read			2
snippets from the manual showed diagrams of hairstyles , explaining that the company allowed ' sunkissed / subtle highlighting with complementary shading ' , but it would not accept ' two - tone color ' hair or ' chunks of contrasting color '			0
strict : one snippet from the august 2013 policy , obtained by @entity168 , shows the rules for hair color ' all hairstyles for men and women should appear neat , clean , natural , kempt and classic , ' the manual reads			0
' no associate is permitted to wear any extreme hair styles or hair color			0
hair styles and hair color should reflect your natural beauty			0
' facial hair is banned , men are not allowed to wear earrings , makeup must also look ' natural ' and any colored nail polish is ' unacceptable ' , according to the guidelines			0
visible tattoos are only allowed if they suit the @entity8 brand and if they are approved by a supervisor			1
' fingernails should not extend more than 1/4 inch beyond the tip of the finger , ' the handbook adds			0
rules : the handbook shows that facial hair is ' unacceptable ' and that fingernails must be worn short while headwear is not allowed , the look policy does say that exemptions can be made for religious and disability reasons , @entity168 notes			2
if an applicant or employee asks for an exception based on these reasons , human resources must be contacted immediately , the handbook says			0
as for clothes , employees are encouraged to look smart while displaying their individual style			0
' clothing should also be consistent with the season ( e.g. a heavy wool turtleneck sweater should not be worn in 90 degree heat ) , ' the manual added			0
' clothing choices should be clean and classic , not provocative ( e.g. tanks should be worn with an undergarment )			0
' the handbook says that if employees fail to follow the guidelines , they could be fired			0
no discrimination : the handbook also points out that it does allow head coverings for religious reasons			0

@entity14 arrived for an interview for a ' model ' position at an @entity266 in @entity17 , @entity18 in 2008 wearing a black headscarf
even though she impressed staff , her headscarf conflicted with the company 's ' @entity271 ' and the store *decided* not to employ her
@entity8 has fought her employment discrimination claim because it says she never asked the company to relax its policy
on wednesday , @entity14 took her complaint to the @entity2 and the majority of justices appeared to back her
a *decision* will be made in the suit by june
