from the man who swears that garlic sandwiches give his love life a boost to the intrepid soul who thinks putting leeches on your bottom can cure deep vein thrombosis , the home remedies championed by the @entity1 can seem a motley bunch			1
but few can be as bizarre as the claims made by builders @entity15 and @entity16 , who say that industrial lubricant @entity17 can help cure arthritis and ease a congested chest			1
the duo made their odd claim on @entity26 documentary series @entity24 , which offers people with a home remedy they swear by the chance to have it checked over by a panel of doctors			1
magic spray : @entity16 ( left ) and @entity15 claim that industrial lubricant @entity17 is the cure for arthritis and chest pain currently , more than 10 million people suffer from arthritis in the @entity1 alone , and the cost to the @entity39 runs into millions			1
@entity16 , who suffers from the condition , said : ' i went to the doctor and he prescribed me paracetamol for my arthritis			1
' i sprayed @entity17 on my knees and it seemed to be better			2
' ' at first i thought he was completely mad and then i saw what it was doing for him so i thought i 'd give it a go , ' added fellow bricklayer @entity15			2
' it works for me			2
thousands of bricklayers across the country ca n't be wrong ! ' unsurprisingly , the panel of medics were unimpressed			1
' as far as i know , there 's nothing in @entity17 that would have an effect on the joints apart from the cooling effect and the fact that rubbing helps , ' said veteran gp , dr. @entity65			2
unimpressed : dr @entity65 ( left ) and dr @entity66 said using the lubricant as medicine could be dangerous asked if he was worried about any potentially toxic side - effects of using @entity17 , @entity16 added : ' no , i 'm not worried about toxins			1
if you do your research , you 'll see there are fish oils in @entity17			0
' @entity15 , meanwhile , claimed that the product had helped ease his congested chest			0
' i 'm a smoker and i suffer with a tight chest , ' he explained			0
' i apply @entity17 and makes it better and it takes seconds			0
' once again , the panel failed to see his point			2
' when smokers have a tight chest , it 's actually their lungs which are tight not their chest , ' said dr @entity66 , a long - standing gp			0
' there 's no way that @entity17 can be getting through to your lungs to actually improve your breathing			0
' she added : ' this is one of the craziest ideas i 've ever heard , i would advise you to stop doing it and to seek proper treatment			0
' real use : the makers of @entity17 say the lubricant works better on bumpers than it does on human joints asked by @entity108 to comment on the claims , a spokesman for @entity17 said : ' this is one of the myths we regularly deal with			0
' the @entity112 does not recommend the use of @entity17 multi-use product for medical purposes , and knows no reason why it would be effective for arthritis pain relief			0
' the product contains petroleum distillates and should be handled with the same precautions for any product containing this type of material			0
' among other unusual remedies featured in the documentary were amber necklaces and duct tape , thought to soothe teething pains and cure veruccas			1
although the duct tape was later proved to have an impressive effect on tackling veruccas , the amber beads did not impress the panel of gps and , according to the medical professionals , does nothing to soothe teething pain in babies			1
