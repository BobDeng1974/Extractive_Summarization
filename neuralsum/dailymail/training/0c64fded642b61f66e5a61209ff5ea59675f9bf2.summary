by @entity0 for @entity1 travellers have been accused of creating a ' @entity3 ' of rubbish after dumping two tonnes of waste on playing fields in revenge for being moved on			1
the group allegedly went door - to - door collecting doors , toilets , furniture , and rubble before leaving mountains of mess on @entity16 in @entity17			1
@entity18 had them evicted last week after they set up an illegal camp there - so in response to the court order the travellers appear to have dumped the commercial and domestic waste			1
taxpayers will be left with a bill of at least £ 15,000 to clear up the mess			1
disgusting : travellers have been blamed for dumping two tonnes of waste on playing fields after they were evicted from some public playing fields allegations : the group went door to door to collect whatever items they could get from homes and businesses after @entity18 had them removed mess : the local council say the clear - up will cost at least £ 15,000 and every penny will have to be covered by the taxpayer @entity43 , 32 , who uses the playing field to walk his dog told the @entity46 : ' i can not believe the mess is still there			1
i ’ve never seen anything dumped on this scale before			0
' there ’s everything from broken toilets to piles of office furniture all dumped in big mounds			2
it ’s like the @entity3 of rubbish and mess that you can walk through '			0
@entity63 , 25 , who also walks his dogs there told the @entity66 : ' i am angry as after all this is where i live and it is being vandalized			0
this is not the first time this happened			0
' it happens a few times every year , not just in the park but also in the woods opposite			0
' they stay , dump their rubbish , then go			0
they have no regard for residents and the many families who live in the area '			0
tough job : a worker uses a rake to try to clear the mess as a @entity86 digger is used to lift the larger items dumped vast : people who use the playing fields have said that they have never seen anything like the mess left detritus : doors , toilets , furniture , commecial waste and rubble has been dumped on @entity16 hard work : @entity17 council promises to remove fly - tipped waste in 48 hours but this could take longer how it should look : @entity16 is a much loved community resource that was taken over by travellers several weeks ago the local council launched its ' do n't mess with @entity17 ' campaign in may and promised all fly tipping would be removed within 48 hours - but the travellers ' waste has been there since last week			1
a spokesman said : ' the cost of clearing the fly - tip from @entity114 is £ 15,000 , a cost that is borne by @entity17 's council taxpayers			1
the council is determined to stamp out this criminal activity and will prosecute any fly - tippers that dump their rubbish on borough roads			2
' we are aware of the fly - tipping in @entity114 and are in the process of removing it			2
' we will also be seeking to prosecute those responsible			0

the group allegedly went door - to - door collecting waste from homes and businesses before dumping two tonnes of it
@entity18 had secured court order to remove illegal camp , which led to mountains of rubbish being left
locals who use the playing fields have *expressed* their *disbelief* at the scale of the fly tipping
taxpayers will be left with a bill of at least £ 15,000 to clear up the piles and piles of doors , furniture and rubble
