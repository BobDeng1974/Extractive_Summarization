by @entity0 published : 10:18 est , 18 april 2013 updated : 11:09 est , 18 april 2013 astronomers have found the most prolific star factory in the @entity3			1
named @entity5 , it is 12.8 billion light - years from @entity6 - and is producing the equivalent of nearly 3,000 @entity8 per year			1
this makes it more than 2,000 times more prolific than our own @entity11			1

the background image is @entity19 / @entity18 image of the portion of sky in which @entity5 was found , zoomed in			1
the upper - left inset is combined radio / millimeter / submillimeter image of the distant galaxy			1
top right is @entity27 spectrum showing radio emission from @entity30 molecules , which gave away its location the team made the discovery in a galaxy so distant that they see it as it was when the universe was only six percent of its current age			2
stars are born within dust clouds scattered through galaxies			0
turbulence pushes gas and dust together , and the resulting knot begins to collapse under its own gravitational attraction			0
as it collapses , the material at the centre heats up and becomes a protostar - the hot core that will eventually become a star			2
the protostar gathers more dust and gas , though not all of it ends up part of the star			0
the ' leftovers ' become planets , asteroids , comets ... or just remain as dust			0
the galaxy is massive , with a huge reservoir of gas from which to form new stars			2
' this is the most detailed look into the physical properties of such a distant galaxy ever made , ' said @entity71 , of @entity72			2
' getting detailed information on galaxies like this is vitally important to understanding how galaxies , as well as groups and clusters of galaxies , formed in the early universe , ' he added			0
to accurately determine the galaxy 's distance and characteristics required observations with 12 international telescope facilities , including both orbiting and ground - based telescopes			1
the telescopes ranged from visible - light telescopes , to instruments working at infrared , millimeter - wave , and radio wavelengths			1
the @entity92 's @entity27 ( @entity27 ) provided information about cold molecular gas from which new stars are being formed and the radio waves emitted by the remnants of deceased , short - lived , very massive stars			2
the @entity92 's @entity27 ( @entity27 ) provided information about cold molecular gas from which new stars are being formed the scientists found that the galaxy has a mass of stars nearly 40 billion times the mass of the @entity106 , and gas and dust totalling more than 100 billion times the mass of the @entity106 , all surrounded by enough mysterious dark matter to eventually build an entire cluster of galaxies			1
' this galaxy is proof that very intense bursts of star formation existed only 880 million years after the @entity117 , ' @entity71 said			1
' we 've gotten a valuable look at a very important epoch in the development of the first galaxies , ' he said			0
the @entity3 currently is about 13.7 billion years old			1
' key information about the massive amount of gas in this galaxy came from the @entity27 observations of radio emission from @entity30 , ' said @entity129 , chief scientist of the @entity130 , who was not part of the research team			0
' the techniques used by this team , along with improved technical capabilities available now and coming in the future , will allow the study of more such galaxies , and provide a much better understanding of how the first galaxies formed during the @entity3 's youth , ' @entity129 added			0
the researchers now hope to use the @entity144 telescope in the @entity146 hills to find out more the researchers now hope to use the @entity144 telescope in the @entity146 hills to find out more			0
' we anticipate learning more about such galaxies using both the @entity27 and the @entity144 ( @entity144 ) , ' @entity71 said			0
' the @entity27 can give us information about the cold gas and radio emission in these galaxies , while @entity144 can tell us about the warmer gas and dust , ' he added			0
in addition to the @entity27 , the astronomers used the @entity158 , the @entity159 , the @entity160 , the @entity161 , the @entity162 , the @entity164 30 - meter telescope , the @entity165 and @entity166 , the @entity167 , the @entity168 , and the @entity169 .			0

the galaxy , *dubbed* @entity5 is 12.8 billion light - years from @entity6
found to be 2,000 times more prolific than our own @entity11
