from diseased horses to displaced cattle and family dramas , @entity0 has kept listeners captivated for more than six decades with its authentic storylines			2
but , while its ‘ everyday story of country folk ’ in @entity11 is pure fiction , it seems it paints a better picture of rural life than @entity14			2
@entity16 ’s flagship drama has been singled out as one of the ‘ gems ’ of the @entity14 ’s rural coverage in an independent review published by the @entity21			1
a report has found that @entity0 paints a better picture of rural life than @entity14			1
pictured is the @entity25 of @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity28			0
it 's bells can be heard in the long - running radio serial the long - running soap is credited with setting ‘ a rural pulse twice a day , six days a week on @entity16 ’ and playing ‘ an important role in reflecting rural events that might be “ too slow growing ” for mainstream news programmes ’			1
this is in contrast to wider @entity14 coverage of rural affairs , which the report labelled ‘ squeamish ’ and ‘ simplistic ’ , highlighting a lack of reporters with in - depth knowledge of rural issues as a key concern			1
the @entity14 as a whole , while commended for being ‘ generally impartial ’ , was criticised for often painting rural communities as one of two extremes – either a rose tinted - idyll or area of stark deprivation			2
@entity55 editor @entity54 said there is a ‘ squeamishness ’ about portraying the grittiness of rural life and that this approach did ‘ the countryside a real disservice ’			0
key problems identified by the report were the lack of coverage of rural issues in national news , the narrow range of voices and opinions heard in reports , a ‘ metropolitan bias ’ in what stories are covered and an over-simplification of complex rural issues			0
@entity14 was also accused of having an ‘ unintended bias ’ when reporting on controversial issues , particularly on the furore surrounding badger culls			2
@entity81 is also seen as a key component of the @entity14 's efforts to reflect rural issues			1
pictured left to right are @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 from the show one of the problems identified was the use of images of ‘ cute ’ and healthy badgers in reports , rather than ones infected with @entity97 , which critics say pushed the audience towards a sympathetic view of the animals			0
@entity102 , a committee member for the @entity103 , told the review : ‘ @entity105 – the first thing you see are cute badgers			0
the argument has already gone			0
immediately the impression is formed			0
’ the @entity0 was explicitly excluded from the report ’s remit because it is not a factual or current affairs programme			2
however , @entity114 , the review ’s author and former senior partner at consulting firm @entity117 , felt the show was so integral to the @entity14 ’s rural offering the she could not complete her work without addressing it			2
she said : ‘ it proved impossible to ask any audience or stakeholder about the @entity14 ’s rural affairs coverage without discussing the significance of @entity0 ’			1
she identified it , along with @entity126 ’s @entity81 and @entity16 ’s @entity127 , as a key component of the @entity14 ’s efforts to reflect rural issues and found that its audience ‘ hold it to be a fair and accurate reflection of farming and rural affairs ’			1
‘ it proved impossible to ask any audience or stakeholder about the @entity14 ’s rural affairs coverage without discussing the significance of @entity0 ’ - @entity114 stretching back more than 17,000 episodes , it was started by @entity141 in 1950 with the aim of entertaining farmers and educating them on how to feed a country still subject to post-war rationing			1
it now commands around 5 million listeners a week as it chronicles the bustling farming community			0
while it has occasionally courted controversy , dropping 400,000 listeners in 2012 , with listeners complaining the show was being ‘ sexed up ’ and was becoming unrealistic with storylines involving rape , abortion and arson attacks , it has always stayed true to its rural roots			0
alongside the family dramas and human relationships , recent episodes have seen an outbreak of strangles – a respiratory infection that effects horses – at the local stables , a pig farm being threatened with losing its organic status over infringements of feeding guidelines and a herd of cattle being displaced by floods			0
it is known for the meticulous research it put into storylines and has archivists to ensure it remains consistent in its approach , both to characters and the land they live on , over the decades			0
a spokesman for @entity14 said : ‘ we take our commitment to the reporting of rural affairs very seriously and welcome the report ’s endorsement of our programming and overall impartiality			1
' whilst the report finds overall we do a good job reflecting and reporting rural affairs there are areas where we can do better and we have committed to a range of steps to help improve the coverage further			1

the @entity0 credited with setting ' a rural pulse 's throughout the week
radio 4 drama has ' important role ' in reflecting rural affairs in @entity206
independent review criticises @entity14 's wider rural coverage as ' simplistic '
@entity14 defends reporting of country matters but vows to improve
