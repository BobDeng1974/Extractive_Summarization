my life in houses by @entity3 to me , the description ‘ a homemaker ’ is a great compliment , but i ’ve often wondered whether we do ‘ make ’ our homes , or whether they weave their own magic around our lives , slowly creating us in their own image			1
it ’s an exercise in give and take : a working partnership with bricks and mortar — far more profound than the colours of paint or cushions			0
novelist and biographer @entity21 certainly believes this			1
she begins her memoir by quoting @entity26 : ‘ looking back on my life , i tend to see it divided into sections which are determined by the houses in which i have lived , not by school , university , work , marriage , death , division or war			1
’ ‘ @entity38 came first , with @entity39 , but for tea , not dinner			0
next came @entity42 and @entity43 , but for an evening meal ' like @entity26 , @entity21 believes your home determines every aspect of your life			1
because of that , she tells her life story in terms of the roofs she has known — an interesting device , which enables her to withhold as many secrets as an ancient building in a ghost story			1
this is not an emotional memoir , since her ( well - known ) husband and children scarcely have walk - on parts			1
the emotional punch comes at the end — all the more powerful because of the reticence that has gone before			1
for this celebrated writer is facing her own death from cancer			0
the house she loves is now a refuge ; it evokes a happy , creative past , but can not shelter her from an inevitably sad future			0
@entity21 ’s trajectory typifies the social mobility that , in the post-war period , helped to rebuild @entity79 and make it great			2
good parents , an excellent grammar - school education , generous university grants , hard work and talent took her from a modest council house to a @entity89 terrace in @entity90 , bought for a song 50 years ago , but now worth a fortune			2
£ 1,772 - average spent per household per year on home improvements @entity21 was born in 1938 , ‘ in the front bedroom of a house in @entity96 , a house on the outer edge of @entity98 ’ , a council estate in @entity99 designed to provide homes for the ‘ lucky ’ deserving poor , who were still not quite worthy of indoor lavatories			1
( many years later , she revisits this house , only to find it trashed by the undeserving poor : a bleak , dispiriting lesson in social change )			0
@entity108 quickly realised her home was n’t as good as some of those she visited			1
she fantasised about views prettier than the one she had			0
the family ’s move to a better council house ( with an indoor loo ) met with her approval as did the new fireplace funded by her grandfather : ‘ i was as admiring as everyone else , failing to see how cheap and ugly it was			0
’ we are in the @entity124 now , and @entity21 describes herself as a ‘ swot ’ — a lower - middle - class girl who loves studying in the ‘ best ’ front room and is destined for a scholarship to @entity130 , @entity131			2
as a young woman @entity108 quickly realised her home was n’t as good as some of those she visited			1
however , the unsociable student does n’t really like living in college ( which sounds like inverted snobbery ) , so moves to lodgings in @entity137 — the pretty house she leaves in 1960 to marry her sixth - form sweetheart , @entity139			2
they rent a flat in @entity90 ’s @entity142 and begin a life of extraordinarily prolific writing , with @entity21 producing a novel every year and @entity139 landing the first ( and only ) authorised biography of @entity147 , and a stellar career in journalism			1
there are lovely tales of landlords , landladies and fellow lodgers in an account that sometimes reads like one of @entity21 ’s well - loved novels : full of sharp observation and gentle wit			2
in 1963 , @entity21 and @entity139 obtained a £ 3,600 , 20 - year mortgage on a smelly , dark , ramshackle house — complete with a sitting tenant — in @entity163			2
@entity21 believes our homes tell our life story gradually , it becomes the @entity168 , although @entity139 and @entity108 flit to @entity169 ( for tax reasons ) for a while , and buy in @entity172 , too — near their @entity99 families			1
their @entity90 home witnesses the births of three children , as well as the couple ’s increasing success			2
movies are made of their books and the house is visited by @entity147 ( minus @entity192 ) : ‘ @entity38 came first , with @entity39 , but for tea , not dinner			0
next came @entity42 and @entity43 , but for an evening meal			0
@entity42 was intent on philosophical discussion , and not much interested in the food			0
i made the same [ aubergine dish ] for @entity182 and @entity183 , but it turned out they were the sort of vegetarians who did n’t like vegetables other than potatoes			0
’ @entity198 may wish there were more anecdotes like that in this book			0
but @entity21 seems most happy when enjoying the isolation of her beloved @entity205 house ( where she and @entity207 spend a good deal of the year ) , or when her @entity90 door has closed and she can walk up to her beloved writing room			1
although home is a refuge for most people , for @entity21 , it became the more so when she was first diagnosed with cancer at the age of 36			1
a mastectomy followed , then another in 1978			0
the idea of the human body as a home is simply , but beautifully , evoked : ‘ it struck me that if , as many claim , the body is merely a house for the spirit and the mind , then its owner has to keep up constant surveillance			0
’ now that her cancer has metastasised and she knows she is ‘ lucky to be still alive ’ , home provides calm and consolation , making her feel ‘ safe ’ in her ‘ nest ’			0
believing ( as i firmly do ) in the spirit of a place , i feel sure that this @entity90 home , with its cheerful yellow door , will forever contain the spirit of a remarkable woman , imprinted upon the walls she loves so much .			2

@entity21 believes our homes tell our life story
this is not an emotional memoir but the punch comes at the end
