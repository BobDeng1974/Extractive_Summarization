even by their own self - proclaimed standards , this sunday on @entity0 had the prospect of being even more @entity4 than normal			1
a top of the league clash and a @entity7 saw everybody from the channel involved on the day setting their alarms alarming early , and making their way to @entity12			1
and it was @entity14 who opened proceedings with a special @entity17 from @entity0 ' studio high in the stands			1
there he welcomed among the guests a new face on the team here , @entity24			1
and early in the discussion , @entity25 proved most prophetic in discussing the game that would take place below them later in the afternoon			1
with a cup final and a top league clash it was always likely to be a @entity33 that lived up to its billing @entity35 scored a fantastic goal for @entity37 in @entity0 's first game of the day from @entity39 he acknowledged the @entity40 was probably ' bottom of the league for top clubs '			1
but as he then went on to point out , both ten years and today , for @entity45 and @entity46 ' this competition can act as a catalyst '			2
well , as it turned out , we 'll now have the opportunity to find out how that pans out			2
next up it was goals on sunday , during which @entity51 very nearly scuppered the @entity4			1
during the show , @entity55 managed to wrestle himself away from pitch side with @entity58 , and went exploring			2
a very entertaining @entity59 then told us about a previous @entity60 visit to @entity12 under @entity61 , before which the usually circumspect boss had arranged a team ' stag do ' , complete with ' archery , a mock casino ... and a shed load of cheese toasties ' , during which time @entity55 had made his way to the @entity46 dressing room			1
here he went on a dizzying tour of the space , where we even got to see the ' tea - making facilities '			2
so , so far , so good			2
there was even a great chat with @entity46 kit man @entity77 who explained that @entity79 took his captain 's duties so seriously , he was like ' a second kit man '			1
and that @entity83 was a fastidious preparer , who would ' stuff his boots with newspaper '			2
' the @entity89 paper , @entity88 ' , added @entity77			2
which is where it all started to go wrong			2
the other guest on the show was @entity95 , who was also in the dressing room			2
reluctantly , he found himself being dragged from his seat by @entity55 ; ' i do n't want to ruin my shoes ' muttered the poor fella			0
to no avail as they went for an impromptu keepy - uppy session which yielded a best total of one			0
' you wo n't see this quality anywhere else ' , cried @entity55			0
you 'd struggle to argue with that			0
luckily , though , the always gregarious co-host redeemed himself later when he produced a knife and fork he 'd ' borrowed ' from the @entity113 to present as a gift to @entity58			0
so at least he 'd provided some decent service			0
the next action came from around 300 miles north of the @entity117 with @entity37 welcoming @entity118 to @entity39			0
another welcome guest was @entity120 on @entity0 ' co-commentary who , it has to be said , did n't have much nice to say about his neighbours from up the @entity124			1
what 's more , he carried on not saying it			1
as the boys in blue toiled away against the men in red , @entity77 had no sympathy			0
' with the experience they have ... i 'd be embarrassed ' , he sighed			0
and he went on , saying it was also ' painful to watch ' , and that ' i keep seeing the same mistakes being made			0
( they 're ) so easy to play against '			0
not much @entity4 going on around those parts for @entity77 , then			0
time to head back to @entity12 , where host @entity138 and his excellent trio of @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142 not only had the run of @entity12 , but also a seeming age to fill before kick off			1
there also appeared to be a mobile analysis buggy that would n't play fair , and a stadium @entity147 they could probably hear back up at @entity39			0
it all made for a painful build - up			0
@entity79 fires the ball home via a deflection off @entity155 to put @entity46 in front at @entity12 after the game at @entity0 headed back to @entity12 to see @entity60 's failed quest for the @entity40 @entity120 was critical of @entity118 after their ' embarrassing ' defeat to @entity37 at lunch time for their cup final coverage @entity0 put together a team of @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity140 @entity141 kept @entity142 focused on football as the @entity166 man put in his best peformance since joining @entity0 luckily , though , the boys decamped at kick - off to the studio where the day had begun			1
where as the game got under way , things started to get back to nudging @entity4			1
all of which was certainly aided at the final whistle by the frequent images we saw of a surprisingly uninhibited @entity46 gaffer , who even managed to take a fall - yet still retain his pride			1
' i 've never seen him so happy ' , said @entity140			1
even if on interview he was a little more the familiar @entity45			0
' celebrations ' , he agreed were in order , but ' in 20 minutes , over			0
things were back to normal for the pundits , too			0
what 's more , i think this was also the best we 've seen of @entity142 since his formal arrival at @entity0			1
with the insightful experience of @entity141 on one side , and the encouraging cajoling of @entity140 on the other , @entity142 was sharp , punchy and keen as mustard to talk football			1
with @entity140 steering him through from a ( thankfully ) fully functioning tv monitor , his dissection of @entity202 's goal was nigh on a masterclass			1
' if i 'm the striker there ' , he enthused			0
which indeed it was , in the end			0
not to mention , even a bit @entity4 .			0

with a cup final and a top of the league clash , @entity0 were on their game
@entity51 's performance was up and down , but football was *plentiful*
@entity142 , @entity141 and @entity140 make strong team
