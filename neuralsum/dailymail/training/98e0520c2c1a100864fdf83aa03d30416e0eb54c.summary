the other three officers , who were identified through a separate internal review by @entity13 rather than the @entity15 , will not face investigation at this time			1
the @entity6 has decided that two do not justify an investigation involving the commission at this stage and the status of the third remains under review			2
@entity6 commissioner @entity42 said : ' the amount of public concern across the country about this episode and the impact on confidence in the police means it is important that a fully independent investigation is conducted to establish how @entity13 dealt with child sexual exploitation			1
' i sincerely hope that victims and their families will see this investigation as a positive step towards answering the many questions they must have			0
i have met with @entity13 and am reassured by their commitment to fully cooperate with the investigation			2
' the spotlight first fell on @entity5 in 2010 when five men , described by a judge as ' sexual predators ' , were given lengthy jail terms after they were found guilty of grooming teenage girls for sex			1
the five men - @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity70 , @entity70 , and @entity72 - preyed on their victims over several months and threatened them with violence if they refused their advances			0
one of the men branded his victim a ‘ white bitch ’ when she resisted , while a second smirked : ‘ i ’ve used you and abused you			0
' the men , all @entity81 - born @entity80 , attacked the four girls in play areas , parks and in the back of their cars , @entity86 @entity85 heard			0

the girls were abused so frequently that after many months it ‘ became a way of life ’			0
the girls , who were being monitored by social services , were eventually rescued by police and removed from their homes amid growing concerns for their safety			2
in her report , professor @entity110 said senior police and council officials must have known what was happening but failed to act , with staff reluctant to report their concerns out of fear of being called racist			2
children as young as 11 were trafficked , beaten , and raped by large numbers of men between 1997 and 2013 , the council commissioned review into child protection revealed			2
the report found that 1,400 children were sexually exploited in @entity5 over a 16 - year period			1

she condemned the ' blatant ' collective failures by the council 's leadership , concluding : ' it is hard to describe the appalling nature of the abuse that child victims suffered			0
' fears had also been raised by schools over the 16 years but the alerts went uninvestigated			0
teachers reported seeing children as young as 11 , 12 and 13 being picked up outside schools by cars and taxis , given presents and mobile phones and taken to meet large numbers of unknown men in @entity5 or other local towns and cities			2
the majority of victims believed the perpetrators to be their boyfriend who gave them gifts , alcohol and drugs			0
some of the victims still maintain they were not groomed or abused			0
analysing the case studies , professor @entity110 said many of the children came from dysfunctional families , had parents with addictions , and had suffered domestic or sexual abuse as a child			0
today the @entity6 has identified seven parts of the report , which was published in august , that could lead to misconduct allegations against the officers under investigation			1
these include claims that one officer argued against the category of sexual abuse being used because he believed the child had consented to the incident			0
there are also allegations that evidence relating to a suspected rape was lost , and that two officers had failed to properly investigate an incident in which a young girl was found drunk in the back of a car			2
the controversy that followed the publication of the @entity15 report led to a series of high - profile resignations including @entity5 council leader @entity207 , council chief executive @entity208 and council director of children 's services @entity212			1
the most high profile resignation was that of @entity89 's police and crime commissioner @entity90 , who was the @entity5 councillor overseeing children 's services between 2005 and 2010			1
@entity89 's chief constable @entity216 has also been under pressure to explain his force 's attitude towards @entity220 over the last 15 years			0
