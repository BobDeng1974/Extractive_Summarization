a 100 proof vodka - infused turkey is being served at over 100 pubs and taverns across @entity4 to celebrate this year 's @entity5			1
the boozy bird , which was unveiled at @entity7 and @entity8 in @entity9 yesterday , is cooked using a whopping five different vodka flavors : cherry , peach , lemon , and apple			2
for big birds like the ones used at @entity18 's the turkey is infused with vodka every six hours over the course of three days			2
@entity5 spirit : the turkey will be infused with five different flavors of vodka : cherry , peach , lemon , and apple according to @entity18 's owner @entity30 , the amount of alcohol per serving depends almost entirely on how long the turkey is roasted , which is generally up to the chef 's discretion			1
@entity18 's turkey is cooked for five hours , after which the chef removes excess sauce and mixes it with more 100 proof vodka to create a gravy that can be served with a straw			1
according to mr @entity30 , customers have been highly encouraged to use @entity18 's free ride service after indulging in the bird			0
a @entity44 blogger who tried the turkey revealed that it is , ' not as alcoholic as i expected it to be , ' adding : ' it tastes more like you ate some turkey after taking a shot of vodka			2
though after two bites i think i 'm feeling buzzed			0
i 'm not sure if that 's a placebo effect			0
' the idea for a vodka - infused turkey first began in @entity58 when mr @entity30 's mother asked why the @entity61 turkey did n't have any vodka in it			1
from there , mr @entity30 and his mother developed a recipe with @entity68 proof vodka			1
after careful research and taste - testing , the restaurateur first unveiled the boozy meal at @entity18 's in 2009			0
hitting the sauce : the gravy will be made with 100 - proof vodka , giving an extra flavor and kick to the already bombed bird the turkey was a smash hit and quickly sold out			1
mr @entity30 shared his recipe with other @entity4 chefs and restaurant owners and it is now available at over 100 restaurants and pubs during the @entity5 season including @entity86 's , @entity86 's @entity87 , @entity88 84 , and @entity89			1
