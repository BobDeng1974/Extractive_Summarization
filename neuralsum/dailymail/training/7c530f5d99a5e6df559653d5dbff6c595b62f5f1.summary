by @entity0 published : 04:24 est , 19 september 2013 updated : 06:00 est , 19 september 2013 a hungry baboon shows it 's a cheeky monkey by stealing vegetables from a woman carrying her shopping			2
the chacma baboon bides its time and waits to pounce on the oblivious shopper who is the victim of a daylight robbery			1
it patiently waits for people to leave the farmers ' market where fresh vegetables are on sale			2
the moment a hungry and fearless chacma baboon pounces on an oblivious shopper in @entity18 , @entity19 , highlights just how bold these primates are becoming living side by side with people in the city after spotting its target , it ambushes the woman , tugging on her large sticks of rhubarb			1
the adult male monkey managed to get a firm grip on the plant to snatch it from her box of fresh vegetables			0
but the greedy baboon was n't finished and still had an appetite as it grabs a ripe avocado from the woman			2
@entity40 from @entity41 in @entity42 , @entity43 , travelled to @entity18 , @entity19 , to take photographs of the famous baboons in the area			1
the 43 - year - old said : ' i travelled to the city to cover the story of the baboons as their presence is a big issue in that part of @entity18			1
making his move : the baboon had been waiting patiently by the side of the road until he finally spotted an easy target score : the baboon tugged hard at the shopper 's rhubarb until he pulled it out from the helpless shopper 's box of fruit and vegetables ' in the past , @entity70 were trapped here in large numbers , for use in medial research facilities			1
' thanks to the work of local animal rights activists , this practice has been discontinued			0
' as a result , the baboon population has increased and without any natural predators , the animals have become comfortable around humans			0
' the baboons , who sleep in vacated homes and on roofs of buildings , raid the farmers market and houses for food			1
mr @entity40 added : ' they even stake out the local farmers markets , mugging shoppers as they return to their cars			0
' baboons know the market days and what time they start and finish , so they are around at the right moment ready for ambushes			2
fussy eater : after successfully robbing the shopper of her rhubarb , and what looks like a bag of mushrooms , the giant primate appears to have a sniff and turn its nose up at its haul so the shopper bravely returns to retrieve her stolen fruit , presenting another opportunity for the baboon			1
this time it grabs a ripe avocado - apparently a far more appealing reward for its efforts ' the monkey keeps a distance , observing until a good opportunity arises to strike at the right time - it is like a guerrilla strategy			0
' baboons are very strong and can be aggressive , and when they want something it 's a good idea to let them have it			0
' while some people find the coexistence of baboons and people entertaining , for others it is turning into a nightmare , the species has been protected since 1999 and there are now 500 baboons living in 16 groups , increasingly cut off from their native habitats by the sprawling city			1
some estates are now plagued with the primates , which scale blocks of flats pillaging anything they can get their hands on from homes with open windows			0
those who choose to fight back are limited to sticks , pepper sprays and paintball guns			0
they have the momentary effect of driving the baboons away , but hunger and sheer nerve always bring them back			0
baboons are now a common sighting in the sprawling city , seen trawling through waste bins , loitering at rubbish dumps , stealing from shops and markets and prowling around picnic sites .			2

the baboon sat and waited patiently for an easy target leaving a farmers ' market in @entity18 , @entity19
he then made his move , and boldly strode up to a shopper and robbed her in broad daylight of her rhubarb
*unimpressed* with his haul , he then went back a second time , this time stealing an avocado
the protected species is a growing *problem* for @entity18 citizens , some even raid their homes
there are now 500 baboons living in the city and their food *gathering* *tactics* are getting more *daring*
