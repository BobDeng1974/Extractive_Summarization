big beauty : @entity2 mastiffs can weigh 80kg just a year ago they could command prices of up to £ 1.2million each			1
but @entity2 @entity4 are now so unpopular in @entity5 they are being sent to slaughterhouses – and their meat put into cheap hotpots			1
the dogs ' dramatic decline in fortune is being partly blamed on the @entity5 government 's wide - reaching anti-corruption crackdown			1
previously , wealthy businessmen would give the prized mastiffs to officials in the hope of influencing their decisions			2
@entity19 , general manager of @entity5 's largest @entity21 puppy farm , told @entity22 : ' the anti-corruption drive means people not daring to hand them out as gifts - nor would anyone take one as a gift			1
' it is also thought recent bans on owning dogs of more than 50kg in several @entity5 cities - including @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 - has had a huge impact on the breed 's popularity			2
@entity40 – which were traditionally used in @entity42 to herd other animals and are known for their loyalty - can weigh up to 80kg			0
@entity5 's mastiff market collapse was revealed after animal - welfare workers rescued a group of the dogs that were being transported to a slaughterhouse			1
the abattoir they were heading to provides hotpot meat for restaurants			0
the dogs ' skin can also be used for leather belts			2
rescuers said they found the 20 mastiffs in cramped cages			0
a third of the dogs were already dead and none had been given food or water for three days			0
several were suffering from broken bones			0
shocking trade : twenty @entity2 mastiffs were recently found crammed into cages on their way to a slaughterhouse like the dogs in this picture - taken on a motorway in the @entity5 capital @entity33 in 2009 it is feared that across @entity5 hundreds of the dogs are meeting such a cruel fate			1
mastiffs are also being stolen from the streets by ruthless gangs , who sell them to the slaughterhouses , say animal charities			0
unscrupulous breeders are also offloading their ' imperfect ' specimens to the abattoirs			0
@entity19 , whose puppy farm is in @entity42 , said some of his fellow breeders had damaged the quality of the breed to make more money			2
' driven by profits there was a lot of cross-breeding which resulted in a deterioration of the @entity2 mastiff in terms of appearance as well as temperament , ' he explained			2
there was now a glut of poor - quality dogs that ca n't be sold , he added			2
loyal : @entity2 mastiffs , like the one here , were originally used by people in @entity42 to herd other animals in their heyday : a visitor plays with one of the dogs at a @entity2 mastiff show in @entity116 city four years ago meanwhile , @entity117 a specialist in @entity2 mastiff photography , said : ' the rapid pace of urbanisation across @entity5 has made more and more people now realise @entity2 mastiffs are not animals well - suited to city living			1
' the breed 's boom began in 2005 and led to the dogs being seen as status symbols			1
just 13 months ago one puppy sold for £ 1.2million , which is thought to be the highest price ever paid for a dog			1
a property develop bought the golden - haired one - year - old from breeder @entity135 in the eastern province of @entity137			0
mr @entity135 said of his dogs : ' they have lion 's blood and are top - of - the - range mastiff studs			0
' most expensive dog in the world : the gold - maned @entity145 ( left ) sold last year in east @entity5 for £ 1.2million			1
the red pup of the same breed ( right ) fetched nearly £ 600,000			0
the dogs are seen with a model			0

@entity2 mastiffs had been status symbols for @entity5 's wealthiest
they were given as gifts to *grateful* officials by businessmen
one puppy was sold for £ 1.2million to a property developer last year
but an anti-corruption drive means the breed is now shunned
instead the dogs are sold to abattoirs for their meat and skin
