former prime minister sir @entity0 will today ignore warnings from his former @entity3 secretary against talking up the threat posed by the @entity5 @entity9 's campaign attacks on the @entity5 risk undermining the future of the @entity12 , senior conservative peer @entity6 has claimed			1
the former @entity2 said talking up the threat posed by the @entity3 nationalists was ' short - term and dangerous '			1
the stark warning came as the former prime minister @entity0 launched a stinging attack on the threat posed by an @entity5			1
sir @entity0 will say a @entity19 deal with the separatists would mean higher taxes , more debt and fewer jobs - as well as another independence referendum			1
@entity9 yesterday warned that the prospect of a deal between @entity27 and @entity28 was ' a match made in hell for the @entity12 economy ' after the @entity5 unveiled its manifesto in @entity33 yesterday			1
the extraordinary manifesto launch by @entity5 leader @entity28 included massive spending increases , new taxes , more welfare and the end of @entity12 's nuclear deterrent			1
treasury analysis suggests the package would cost taxpayers £ 148billion over five years			0
sir @entity0 , who is the last @entity43 to win an election outright , warned that @entity27 would face a ' daily dose of blackmail ' from @entity47 , whose party may win 50 commons seats			1
the former @entity0 said : ' if @entity19 were to accept an offer of support from the @entity5 , it could put the country on course to a government held to ransom on a vote - by - vote basis			1
' @entity19 would be in hock to a party that – slowly but surely – will push them ever further to the left			2
and who would pay the price for this ? we all would			0
we would all pay for the @entity5 's ransom in our daily lives – through higher taxes , fewer jobs , and more and more debt			1
' sir @entity0 ( pictured at a @entity43 campaign rally today ) , who is the last @entity43 to win an election outright , said @entity27 would face a ' daily dose of blackmail ' from the @entity5 's @entity28 senior figures in @entity27 's ( right ) @entity19 have appeared to soften their stance on a potential deal with the @entity5 and @entity28 ( left ) in a hung parliament			1
it comes after @entity47 vowed to end austerity @entity27 today accused @entity9 of ' playing fast and loose ' with the future of the @entity81 by talking up the threat posed by the @entity5			1
the @entity19 leader said the @entity84 was ' threatening the integrity of the @entity12 ' for his own political gain			1
he insisted there would be no coalition with the @entity5 and denied @entity28 's party would hold the whip hand on policy			1
he told @entity93 's breakfast : ' a @entity19 government led by me , what happens in that @entity19 government will be decided by me , not by the @entity5			1
' @entity19 had ' fundamental differences ' with the @entity5 , such as the nationalist party 's desire for a second independence referendum within five years , he said , adding : ' i 'm not having that			1
' mr @entity27 said mr @entity9 had been ' talking up ' the @entity5 in the hope that it would take votes and seats from @entity19 north of the border and allow him to ' crawl back ' into 10 @entity107			1
' i think @entity9 is playing fast and loose with the @entity12 , ' said the @entity19 leader			1
' this is somebody who has given up hope of winning a majority			0
he is trying to boost the @entity5			2
' i think @entity9 is now threatening the integrity of the @entity12 with the games he is playing			2
and i think conservatives are now ashamed of what he is doing			0
' sir @entity0 added : ' the @entity5 's driving ambition is an independent @entity3 and – as the price for their support – they will demand policies that favour @entity3			1
that is no way to run a country , and nor is it remotely fair to @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131			0
' this is a recipe for mayhem			0
at the very moment our country needs a strong and stable government , we risk a weak and unstable one – pushed to the left by its allies , and open to a daily dose of political blackmail			2
' but the @entity43 tactic of talking up the threat posed by the @entity5 was slammed by sir @entity0 's former @entity3 secretary @entity6 last night			1
the @entity43 peer said : ' we 've had the dilemma for conservatives , which is they want to be the largest party at @entity147 and therefore some see the fact that the nationalists are going to take seats in @entity3 will be helpful			1
' but that is a short - term and dangerous view which threatens the integrity of our country			0
' he said mr @entity9 's call for ' @entity129 votes for @entity129 laws ' in the aftermath of last year 's @entity3 independence referendum vote had ' shattered the unionist alliance against the break - up of the @entity12 '			1
yesterday , senior @entity19 figures appeared to soften their stance on a potential deal with the @entity5 in a hung parliament			1
shadow chancellor @entity167 and health spokesman @entity168 said the party would be prepared to talk to @entity47 to try to win backing for a legislative programme			0
asked to rule out any arrangement with the @entity5 after may 7 , mr @entity167 replied : ' we 'll have to wait and see what the election result is going to be			2
' in a @entity93 interview , mr @entity27 denied the @entity5 would dictate policy but again refused to rule out negotiating for support in major commons votes			2
asked if the @entity5 would be calling the shots , mr @entity27 said : ' that ai n't gon na happen			2
that ai n't gon na happen			0
' miss @entity28 used her manifesto launch in @entity33 to seek to assuage the fears of voters in the rest of the @entity12 about her party being involved in the next government			1
' i hold out the hand of friendship , ' she declared			0
miss @entity28 said her number one priority would be an end to austerity , vowing to make @entity3 's voice heard ' more loudly than it has ever been before '			1
she said she wanted a ' modest ' increase in government spending to ' make life better for ordinary people across these islands '			0
she also backed @entity19 's proposed tax rises			2
spending spree wishlist ... paid for by @entity129 ! the @entity203 yesterday listed their demands for propping up a minority @entity19 government			2
@entity207 examines the consequences for the rest of the @entity12 : debt @entity5 leader @entity28 is pictured launching the @entity5 manifesto at the @entity212 yesterday @entity213 : the @entity5 's key demand is an end to austerity			1
cuts would be replaced with a minimum increase of 0.5 per cent above inflation for five years			0
@entity221 spending would rise by £ 24billion across the @entity12 to deliver a £ 2billion increase in @entity3			0
@entity223 : the additional borrowing , which will fall overwhelmingly on @entity129 taxpayers , will be £ 148billion over five years , according to @entity227 analysis			0
higher taxes @entity213 : the @entity5 wants a 50p top rate of tax , a mansion tax and a new tax on bank bonuses			2
this wish list is identical to @entity19 's and would form the basis of any post-election deal			0
ominously , the manifesto talks of releasing ' additional resources by backing a series of revenue raising measures '			0
@entity223 : even though @entity3 has very few £ 2million - plus homes , the @entity5 still wants a large chunk of mansion tax proceeds to go north			2
@entity244 warns the @entity5 would try to amend a @entity19 budget to introduce ' progressive tax measures ' that would further clobber the middle classes			1
the union @entity213 : the @entity5 would end the convention under which its mps do not vote on @entity129 - only matters in order to limit private sector involvement in the @entity221 , repeal @entity43 health reforms and help @entity19 force through tuition fee changes			1
@entity223 : the damage to the @entity81 caused by @entity3 nationalists foisting policies on the @entity129 which have no impact on their constituents ( the @entity3 @entity221 is @entity3 - run ) could be irreparable			0
more benefits @entity213 : reinstate subsidy paid to housing benefit recipients with a spare room			0
increase handouts at least in line with the higher @entity271 rate of inflation			0
@entity274 plans to cut @entity275 by £ 3billion			0
@entity223 : scrapping the spare room subsidy will cost £ 470million			0
axing @entity273 would reverse a reform intended to break the culture of welfare dependency that became entrenched under @entity19			0
@entity280 @entity213 : scrap @entity12 's nuclear deterrent , saving £ 100billion over the next 35 years			0
@entity223 : failing to renew @entity280 would leave @entity12 's defences – and standing in the world – hugely diminished at a time of great global insecurity			2
verdict : for all the bluster and denials , shared policies on tax and benefits provide the basis for a messy and hugely expensive deal between @entity19 and the @entity5 on a vote - by - vote basis			1
key question is just how much extra borrowing @entity27 would be prepared to offer			0
expect the markets to go into fright and the pound to slump			0
he may have been snubbed by his party for its manifesto launch but @entity244 has clearly been making an impression elsewhere during the campaign			0
the former @entity5 leader , 60 , still hopes to emerge as one of the most powerful figures at @entity147 in the next @entity306 and has been busily electioneering in @entity307 – the @entity309 seat he is favourite to prise from the @entity310			2
and he gave his profile a boost by taking time out for this bizarre photo opportunity , which involved jumping up and down on a mattress in @entity315 , @entity315			0
mr @entity244 was joined by teenager @entity316			0
the oddly dressed 16 - year - old had been planning a stunt leap on to the mattress from his bedroom window			0

@entity43 peer and former minister @entity6 warns against @entity5 attacks
he says the talking up the @entity5 threat undermines future of the @entity12
comes as @entity0 warns a @entity19 - @entity5 alliance will cause chaos
he said @entity19 propped up by @entity5 would mean high taxes and fewer jobs
