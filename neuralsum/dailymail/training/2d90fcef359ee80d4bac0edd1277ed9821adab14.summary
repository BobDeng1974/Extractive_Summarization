by @entity1 reporter published : 05:15 est , 28 march 2012 updated : 08:56 est , 28 march 2012 a mother - of - two who suffered 200 crippling headaches a day has been ‘ cured ’ thanks to a remote control that zaps her brain			1
@entity8 ’s chronic condition is known as ‘ suicide headaches ’ among doctors because of the maddening effect it has on patients			1
waves of pain can strike @entity8 , 58 , in either minute - long bursts of up to 200 a day or in agonising two - hour - long attacks			1
during the episodes she is sometimes unable to move or even talk			1
misery : @entity8 lived with chronic headaches for eight years until she had the implant @entity8 has lived with the chronic cluster headaches for eight years since they started on a holiday in @entity24 with her husband @entity25 , 59 , and daughters @entity27 , 21 , and @entity28 , 19			1
but now @entity8 , from @entity29 , @entity30 , has been handed a lifeline from her misery in the form a remote control that stops her headaches			1
specialist surgeons have inserted the matchbox sized implant into chest so it sends an electric impulse to her brain blocking any pain			1
the stimulator is permanently on but the strength of the implant ’s impulses can be changed through a mobile phone - sized remote control , which she carries with her wherever she goes			1
she now only has one or two headaches a day and has described the results as ‘ a true miracle			1
’ @entity8 , an executive coach specialising in chronic health conditions , had her life turned upside down by the illness and every - day activities became out of the question			1
she said : ' there was one time before when i was shopping in central @entity30 with my daughter and had to just lie down on the floor in @entity63 on @entity64 as the pain was too much			2
' i could n’t do anything until the pain had gone			2
' her specialist , consultant neurologist dr @entity67 said many female patients had said they ’d rather endure child birth every day than suffer these headaches			2
short - lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks ( @entity74 ) are a rare form that more commonly occur in men aged over 50			2
the disorder is marked by bursts of moderate to severe burning , piercing , or throbbing pain , usually on one side of the head and around the eye or temple			2
the pain usually peaks within seconds of onset and may follow a pattern of increasing and decreasing intensity			2
attacks typically occur in daytime hours and last from 5 seconds to 4 minutes per episode			2
individuals generally have five to six attacks per hour			2
other symptoms include watery eyes , reddish or bloodshot eyes and nasal congestion			2
the episodes are generally non-responsive to usual treatment for other headaches			2
studies have shown that injections of glycerol to block nerve signaling along the trigeminal nerve may provide temporary relief			0
there is no proven cure for these headaches			0
the disorder is not fatal but can cause considerable discomfort			0
for more visit www.ninds.nih.gov he said : ' they are commonly referred to as ‘ suicide ’ headaches , as for some patients the pain becomes too much and they make attempts to end their own lives			0
' @entity8 tried fifteen different treatments before the implant , unfortunately they did n’t work but the implant has significantly improved her quality of life			1
' it took three years to diagnose @entity8 with chronic cluster headaches meaning she suffered up to 16 hours of pain a day			0
there is just a one in a 15 million chance of suffering both of @entity8 ’s conditions together , and only 200 people in the @entity131 have had the £ 20,000 implant as only the worst cases qualify			1
@entity8 ’s surgery was only approved once she had tried every other treatment available on the @entity136 first			0
the ground - breaking procedure involves wires being fed under the skin from the implant to two electrodes in her brain			1
in the past the battery in her chest would have been replaced every couple of years , however now the implant is rechargeable , meaning @entity8 has to spend four to six hours a week quite literally ‘ re-charging her batteries ’			1
this is done through the skin with a charger that connects to the mains being placed above the implant			1
she said : ' i use it as time to relax , as i ca n’t really do anything during that time as i ’m plugged in , so it ’s the perfect opportunity to avoid cooking tea			0
' she said : ' i can feel the scar tissue and in some places the wires , but it ’s very discreet , i call it my little friend as i can feel it buzzing constantly			0
' it ’s very soothing to know it ’s there and doing its job			0
' the four - hour operation was carried out in september at the @entity171 in @entity30			0
@entity8 said before that surgery her headaches were a nightmare			0
she said : ' it ’s a very sharp pain , like someone has stabbed a boiling hot rod into your eye and through your head , and then slowly twisting it			0
' @entity8 used to inhale 100 % oxygen for 10 minutes as a treatment for cluster headaches when at its worst , she was unable to drive , was only able to work one day a week			1
simple every - day tasks such as using the cooker were dangerous in case an attack was brought on unexpectedly			0
the condition was also tough for her daughters to understand initially , but @entity8 found support from headache group @entity192 , and was then able to fully explain the severity of her condition			0
she said : ' they were teenagers when it first started , so it was hard for them as they thought ‘ oh mum just has another headache ’ , but now they understand and have been great			0
' she has tried numerous drugs in a bid to control the pain , and even though the implant has worked wonders , she still has to keep using injections , oxygen and drugs to keep the condition at bay			1
@entity8 said : ' i still have good days and bad days			0
' i ca n’t change what ’s happened , but i ’m using my experience to try to help others - as an executive coach i talk to employers about how to deal with chronic illness in the work place			0
' the wait for the implant has had a dramatic impact on her life , especially her career			1
she said : ' when i became ill i had my own business and was thinking of expanding			0
' then the headaches struck , and it all came to a grinding halt			0
' i did n’t tell people because i did n’t want them to question whether i was up to the job , i would work longer hours just to compensate for the fact that i felt i was n’t able to do my work due to feeling so unwell			1

only 200 people in the @entity131 with the worst cases have had the £ 20,000 implant
