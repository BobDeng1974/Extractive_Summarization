accusations : a bearded cleric appears to read charges against the man - using a microphone and @entity67 system to tell the gathered crowd of sadistic onlookers that the man has been accused of stealing painful : a final image shows the victim lying on his back in agony on a metal gurney while a man who appears to be a surgeon tends to the injury on his left hand the video comes just one day after @entity35 released gruesome footage of the murder of a man the terror group accused of working as a spy			1
the video was filmed in @entity113 and shows a man believed to be named @entity115 being led out to a forecourt by masked executioners , who then shoot him in the head multiple times at point blank range			0
in a chilling sign of @entity35 ' reach and influence , @entity115 is understood to have been accused of working as part of a secret spy network based in neighbouring @entity127 member state @entity128 before his brutal filmed execution over the border in @entity2			2
titled ' a lesson to be learned ' , the three minute 40 second video has all the hallmarks of an official @entity35 release - employing hd cameras , @entity138 - style sound and visual effects and slick editing and direction			0
it also carries the logo of one of the group 's official @entity113 - based propaganda arms , @entity113			0
the @entity1 cherry picks sections of the @entity150 and misinterprets the accounts of the @entity152 in order to wage jihad and sign up new recruits , experts say			0
it is estimated that 20,000 people have streamed into the territory in @entity159 and @entity2 , where @entity35 has proclaimed what it calls a ' caliphate ' , ruled by its often brutal version of @entity164 law			2
the group purport to recreate the conquests and rule of the @entity152 and his successors and maintains its worst brutalities - such as beheading captives - only prove its purity in following what it contends is the prophet 's example			0
but now @entity176 clerics and other experts are speaking out , saying that the group hand picks what it wants from @entity164 's holy book , the @entity150 , and from accounts of @entity115 's actions and sayings , known as the @entity184			2
an @entity35 member parades through the streets of @entity7 in @entity2 waving an @entity1 flag and brandishing a gun			1
experts have now said that @entity35 misinterprets the @entity150 in order to wage jihad it then misinterprets many of these , while ignoring everything in the texts that contradicts those hand - picked selections			2
writings by the group 's clerics and its @entity200 online magazine , @entity199 , are full of citations from @entity150 verses , the @entity184 and centuries of interpreters , mostly from hardliners			0
but @entity206 , an assistant professor of @entity208 at @entity209 in the @entity210 , says these are taken far out of context by @entity35			0
he explained that @entity164 scholars throughout history have used texts in a ' decontextualised way ' to suit their purposes and says that @entity35 represent the extreme			0
