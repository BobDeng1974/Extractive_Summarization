by @entity1 reporter published : 14:23 est , 25 june 2012 updated : 05:59 est , 26 june 2012 @entity2 has become the fifth eurozone country to apply to @entity4 for an emergency bailout			1
the tiny @entity7 country is applying for funds for both for its banking sector , which has been hit by exposure to @entity13 and for its budget deficit			1
the announcement means @entity2 would follow @entity13 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 into the arms of the emergency rescue funds set up for the 17 - member euro currency zone			1
finance minister @entity35 said the country would also seek enough money to help with its budget deficit			1
the full amount would be decided over the course of weeks			2
' the amount will be as much as it may be needed to cover the recapitalisation and fiscal requirements , ' he told @entity45			1
' these will be established after careful review during the next few weeks			0
' with its coffers emptying rapidly and hurtling towards an immovable deadline , the island suffered a further sovereign credit rating cut on monday by @entity52 , to the non-investment , or junk , bb + grade			1
@entity2 has already been shut out from raising new funds on capital markets , with yields on its existing bonds well into double digits			0
@entity2 president @entity61 , the @entity63 's only @entity62 leader , has been reluctant to accept the fiscal and regulatory conditions that might be attached to a @entity29 rescue @entity2 officials said the bailout request did not specify how much they need from their @entity63 partners			1
an island with just 1 million residents , @entity2 has a disproportionately large financial sector that is heavily exposed to @entity13 , a neighbour more than 10 times the size with which it shares a language , culture and close political links			1
a government statement said : ' the purpose of the required assistance is to contain the risks to the @entity2 economy , notably those arising from the negative spill over effects through its financial sector , due to its large exposure in the @entity13 economy			1
' with a bailout widely viewed as all but inevitable , @entity2 has for weeks been trying to juggle its options between a bailout from @entity29 's rescue funds - the temporary @entity95 and the permanent @entity96 - or a bilateral loan from either @entity98 or @entity99			1
@entity2 president @entity61 was scheduled to brief political leaders on tuesday afternoon , a statement from the presidency said			0
the @entity63 's only @entity62 leader , @entity61 has been reluctant to accept the fiscal and regulatory conditions that might be attached to a @entity29 rescue			0
as late as this weekend , trips by government officials to @entity99 suggested @entity2 was still holding out hope for a bilateral loan from a third country			0
on friday night @entity61 spoke of ' trying to avoid ' the @entity113 , @entity114 and tourism minister @entity112 was dispatched to @entity99 , where talks were focused on a loan or a @entity99 investment in the troubled @entity31			0
' we have had some contacts ... we have requested an answer in coming days , ' @entity112 said in comments to the state broadcaster hours before the government said it would be applying to the @entity63			0
@entity124 already provided @entity2 with 2.5 billion euros in a bilateral loan last year and has an interest in maintaining @entity2 as an offshore financial centre with low tax rates for @entity98 businessmen , who use it as a base to reinvest in @entity98			0
gloom : a commercial property lies vacant in the island 's capital @entity136			2
@entity2 has a disproportionately large financial sector that is heavily exposed to @entity13 however , seeking such large sums from @entity124 or @entity139 is controversial in @entity2 , where @entity63 membership is a matter of national pride			1
it could be embarrassing for @entity4 as well , as @entity2 assumes the bloc 's rotating presidency on july 1			0
@entity2 is fiercely protective of a corporate tax rate that is one of the lowest in the @entity63 , and eight months before a general election shows no appetite for the stringent spending cuts likely to be demanded in return for @entity63 funding			2
@entity61 has repeatedly said any economic measures would not further impact ' the workers '			0
the @entity155 has repeatedly urged @entity2 to take measures to cut its deficit below 3.0 percent and increase the competitiveness of the economy			2
the government says it is in the process of implementing such steps and targets a deficit of about 2.5 percent of gdp this year			2
@entity2 is fiercely protective of a corporate tax rate that is one of the lowest in the @entity63 ' the main source of concern is the bank recapitalisation , but given that the @entity155 is coming out quite strongly about excessive imbalances in the @entity2 economy one would expect them to look at that too , ' said @entity173 , head of economic research at @entity175			2
@entity31 needs a capital infusion urgently to satisfy regulators after writing off the value of @entity13 government bonds in a sovereign debt swap earlier this year			1
in its report , @entity52 said the recapitalisation bill for @entity2 banks could potentially reach 4 billion euros			0
that amount , equivalent to 23 percent of @entity164 , would also take into account rising non-performing loans from the domestic market .			0
