too early : @entity6 , 79 , from @entity8 , was unable to use is bus pass because he was two minutes early but he was stunned when the female driver told him he was just two minutes early to use his bus pass - which is only valid after 9.30am			1
dad - of - three mr @entity6 , who only had £ 1 in his pocket so could n't afford the £ 1.90 fare , was then forced to walk to his 10am doctor 's appointment			1

bus stop : the retired engineer planned to catch the @entity14 number 71 bus after medics told him not to drive for three months following a stroke ' i had a pound in my pocket because i was n't intending on spending any money and asked how much the fare was			1
' the driver said it was £ 1.90 and that threw me			2
' i did n't have time to go home and get money so decided to walk to the doctors			2
i got there just in time for the appointment at 10am so it took me almost half an hour			2
' mr @entity6 said he did n't accept the driver 's apology			1
' she was extremely apologetic but i would say she was a jobsworth			0
' he continued , ' i think she was too apprehensive about risking her job by doing something that was n't in her company rules			0
' i was in a job role where i managed 30 to 40 people and know you can bend the rules sometimes			0
' it 's been an extremely difficult time for me and i could 've done without it			2
' walk : dad - of - three @entity6 , who only had £ 1 in his pocket so could n't afford the £ 1.90 fare widowed @entity72 , whose wife @entity73 passed away aged 75 two years ago , said his three children were furious about his treatment			2
he said : ' my children have said what she could have done is let me go to the back of the bus and then swiped the card at the next stop because it would have been after half 9 by then			2
' his daughter @entity83 added : ' the next stop was only 100 yards down the road and the bus was n't full so surely he could have stayed on until then			1
' they say they do n't know everyone 's personal circumstances and they would n't have known he had suffered a stroke but you only need to look at my dad to know he is old			2
' he is an old man with health problems and he does n't need to be treated this way			0
' all my dad wanted was an apology but they are so unsympathetic because they are a big company and think they can get away with it			0

' our ticket machines are programmed to comply with the local authority scheme and we are obliged to adhere to this			0
' these situations are always going to be difficult for our drivers to deal with			0
' as stated by the gentleman , our driver was apologetic and explained the situation to him			0
' i think it 's also fair to state that our drivers do not know the personal circumstances of every person that travels			0
