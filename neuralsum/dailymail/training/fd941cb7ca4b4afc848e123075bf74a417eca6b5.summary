@entity0 's hit kids ' movie @entity3 may be the most @entity5 film to come out this year -- imitating @entity7 's sacrifice and featuring a main character that shares parallels with @entity10			1
that 's the argument @entity12 , an assistant professor of history at @entity14 , made on @entity15 on sunday			1
@entity12 said the film 's central relationship , between snow queen @entity18 and her sister @entity19 , mirrors the sacrifices @entity7 made for sinners in the @entity22			1
scroll down for trailer @entity3 , @entity12 says , could be the most @entity5 movie of 2013 ' the @entity5 message is that people are sinners and have these broken relationships and that @entity7 comes and takes on the punishment for that sin , dies a death that he did n't deserve , then is resurrected and brings reconciliation through people , ' @entity12 said on the program			1
' and the problem [ is that ] @entity18 has broken relationships			2
and she has guilt and she pushes people away			0
and her sister is sort of like a @entity7 figure who pursues her			0
' ' @entity19 comes and pursues and when she pursues [ @entity18 ] , she has to die and then she 's resurrected which kind of proves the strength of her love and it brings reconciliation and @entity18 is saved because her sister dies , and these are very strong @entity5 themes , ' he continued			1
@entity12 also told @entity15 he noticed ' some parallels ' between @entity3 and @entity48			2
he expressed similar sentiments in a blog post on @entity51 , the official humanities blog for @entity14			0
@entity12 compares @entity18 's magical creation of a frozen palace , as well as her declaration of freedom in the song ' @entity58 , ' with @entity10 's icy lair in @entity61 's text			1
' except , is @entity18 really free ? ' he writes			0
' she ’s trapped herself in an ice palace , and she ’s all alone			0
by indulging her gift , she ’s imprisoned herself			0
' he says @entity3 's @entity18 , pictured , shares parallels with @entity10 , since both yearn for freedom but are ultimately trapped after using their talents for selfish purposes @entity12 , pictured , is an associate professor at @entity14 ' @entity10 has six great wings , and every time he flaps them , they produce an icy blast that further freezes him in place , ' he says			1
' his wings were a gift , but since he is trying to use his gift to serve himself rather than @entity78 , his wings have become a curse			0
' @entity12 also writes that the children 's film has elements similar to @entity84 's @entity83			2
@entity18 's fall is ' in a manner consistent with the @entity89 literary tradition ’s picture of humanity ’s decent into sin , ' he writes			2
' we call license “ freedom , ” and it enslaves us			0
luckily for @entity18 , a redeemer is coming to rescue her instead of leaving her trapped in her frozen hell			1

@entity12 , an assistant professor at @entity14 , says the relationship between characters @entity18 and @entity19 imitate @entity7 's self - sacrifice for sinners
compares @entity18 's ' frozen hell ' to @entity10 's icy lair in @entity48
says @entity18 and @entity10 both use their *personal* gifts for selfish purposes , imprisoning themselves
