by @entity0 published : 04:03 est , 17 april 2012 updated : 04:03 est , 17 april 2012 @entity1 yesterday accused @entity2 in court of knowingly stealing a key piece of technology to build into the search giant 's @entity7 smartphone operating system			1
@entity9 , for @entity1 , drew an unflattering portrait of @entity2 's top executives regard for intellectual property in a battle over the mind - numbing minutiae of computer coding			1
' we will prove to you from beginning to end ... that @entity2 knew it was using someone else 's property , ' mr @entity9 told the @entity21 , @entity23 court			1
key witnesses : @entity1 ceo @entity25 ( left ) and @entity2 ceo @entity26 ( right ) are expected to testify in the early stages of the eight - week trial the showdown centres on allegations that @entity7 infringes on the patents and copyrights of @entity33 , a programming technology that @entity35 began developing 20 years ago			1
@entity1 , a business software maker based in @entity36 , acquired the rights to @entity33 when it bought @entity35 for $ 7.3billion ( £ 4.6billion ) in january 2010			2
@entity2 , the @entity38 , @entity23 - based internet search leader , has steadfastly denied @entity1 's allegations since the lawsuit was filed seven months after the @entity35 deal closed			1
the impasse has left it to a 12 - member jury to resolve the dispute in a trial scheduled to last as long as 10 weeks			0
@entity49 district judge @entity48 devoted most of yesterday 's session to picking the jury , leaving only enough time for @entity1 to lay out the framework for its case			2
@entity1 is seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages and an injunction to force @entity2 to pay licensing fees or find an alternative to @entity33 to keep its @entity7 system running			1
at one point in the lawsuit , @entity1 estimated it might be owed as much as $ 6.1billion ( £ 3.8billion )			2
but judge @entity48 has whittled the case down in a way that has substantially lowered the size of the potential payout if @entity2 loses			2
in a sign of how far apart the two sides are , @entity2 last month said it would be willing to pay $ 2.8million ( £ 1.8million ) plus a tiny percentage of its future revenue if the jury decides @entity7 infringed on two @entity33 patents			2
@entity2 has n't publicly estimated what it thinks its liability might be if the jury decides @entity7 violates , as @entity1 alleges , 37 @entity33 programming copyrights			1
the copyright disagreement - the most important point of the case - will be covered in the first phase of the trial followed by the patent dispute			0
if necessary , a third phase will be devoted to how much money @entity2 owes @entity1			1

the smartphone system forms a significant part of the $ 38billion - a - year business much of the evidence presented during the trial will delve into highly technical matters likely to only be comprehensible to programming geeks and patent - law specialists			0
however , there may be dramatic interludes that lift a veil on the inner workings of two of the world 's most influential technology companies			0
the intrigue will include testimony from the two companies ' multibillionaire ceos , @entity1 's @entity25 and @entity2 's @entity26			1
@entity1 indicated yesterday that it could call mr @entity25 to the stand as early as today			0
several other @entity107 luminaries , including former @entity2 ceo @entity108 and former @entity35 ceo @entity109 , are also on the list of potential witnesses			0
mr @entity9 focused much of his opening statement on excerpts from internal emails suggesting @entity2 knew it needed to pay licensing fees to use some of the java technology that went into @entity7 , a project that began in earnest in 2005 when @entity2 bought a startup run by @entity119			0
the first phone running on @entity7 did n't go on sale until october 2008 , about 15 months before @entity1 bought @entity35 and stepped up the attempts to make @entity2 pay up for the java technology			1
dispute : a screenshot of @entity2 's @entity7 software , which @entity1 claims infringes on its copyrights @entity1 cited an october 2005 email from mr @entity119 to mr @entity26 as an early sign that @entity2 realised it probably would have to pay @entity35 for using @entity33 in @entity7			1
mr @entity119 wrote : ' my proposal is that we take a license that specifically grants the right for us to @entity135 our product			0
' mr @entity9 pointed to a may 2006 email from mr @entity108 to mr @entity119 as an indication @entity2 knew it might need to find other solutions for @entity7 if an agreement with @entity35 was not reached			0
' how are we doing on the @entity35 deal ? ' mr @entity108 asked in his message			0
' its ( sic ) it time to develop a @entity144 solution to avoid dealing with them ? ' by august 2010 , @entity2 still had n't been able to find any satisfactory alternatives to @entity33 , according to an email from @entity2 engineer @entity148 to mr @entity119			0
' we have been over a bunch of these , and think they all suck , ' wrote mr @entity148 , who worked at @entity35 before joining @entity2			0
' we conclude that we need to negotiate a license for @entity33 under the terms we need			0
' the lack of a licensing agreement ultimately did n't deter @entity2 , mr @entity9 told the jury , because the company realised it needed a mobile software system to preserve its digital search - and - advertising empire as more sophisticated phones enabled people to surf the internet away from their desktop computers			1
@entity33 provided @entity2 with a springboard into mobile computing because 6million software programmers were already familiar with the technology and could easily create applications that would run on @entity7 , mr @entity9 said			1
although @entity2 does n't charge device makers to use @entity7 , the company makes money from some of the mobile advertising and mobile applications sold on the system			2
@entity2 has said its mobile advertising revenue now exceeds $ 2.5billion , but it has n't specified how much of that money comes from @entity7 - powered devices .			2

@entity1 alleges that @entity2 chiefs knowingly stole its intellectual property while developing mobile os
@entity2 denies the claims
