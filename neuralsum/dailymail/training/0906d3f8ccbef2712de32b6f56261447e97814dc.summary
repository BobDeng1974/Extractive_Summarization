click here to see more from our brilliant @entity2 service including this map if @entity6 's goal until @entity8 made the changes that produced two quite brilliant goals in the final 20 minutes , @entity7 were in danger of turning into @entity12 of the more recent past here on tuesday			1
a ‘ golden generation ’ of talent , a squad seemingly overflowing with big - money individuals , that comes together for the national team to play stuttering , stagnant football			0
they were dreadful , a goal down and playing nothing like as well as they should have been given the players they have at their disposal ; the third most expensive squad in the competition behind @entity27 and @entity28 based purely on transfer fees			0
the @entity12 players to which one refers might wish to point to the fact that , as awful as they were against @entity38 four years ago , they did at least stop them scoring in one of the most mind - numbing , goalless and utterly soulless encounters in @entity43 history			1
@entity44 survive @entity38 scare finally in front : @entity47 fires @entity7 into the lead in the 80th minute winner : @entity47 wheels away as @entity50 gives chase in celebration of his goal for @entity7 leap : @entity6 flicks his header towards goal to pull his team back into the game level : @entity6 ( centre ) headed home for @entity7 against @entity38 @entity7 ( 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 ) : @entity63 6 ; @entity64 6 , @entity65 6 , @entity66 7 , @entity67 5 ; @entity68 6 , @entity69 7 , @entity70 6 ( @entity6 65 7.5 ) ; @entity71 5 ( @entity47 46 7 ) , @entity50 7 ; @entity72 5 ( @entity73 58 7 )			1

booked : @entity94 goals : @entity95 24 ′ ( pen ) referee : @entity113 att : 56 , 800 * player ratings by @entity115 at the @entity116 it was thanks to @entity12 , not to mention one or two other teams , that @entity38 came into this tournament having not celebrated a @entity43 goal since scoring against @entity122 in @entity123 in 1986			1
but thanks to @entity7 , and in particular to @entity126 ’s @entity125 , that run came to a sudden and dramatic end when @entity90 converted his 25th minute penalty here at the @entity116 and celebrated like he had just won the entire tournament			2
in fairness to the @entity132 forward , whose perfectly timed run panicked @entity135 into committing the foul in the first place , he had just scored a goal that threatened to secure the biggest shock of the competition so far			2
a victory against one of the pre-tournament favourites			0
in the end it was not to be , @entity146 making the changes – with @entity6 and @entity47 among them – that produced the response the @entity7 manager desired			1
a 70th minutes equaliser from @entity6 and a marvellously executed goal , courtesy of @entity50 ’s perfect delivery for @entity47 10 minutes later			1
perhaps it was to be expected			0
perhaps we should remember that , @entity159 aside , these @entity158 players had never been to a @entity43 before			2
but they certainly made life difficult for themselves even if @entity8 claimed beforehand that , having studied videos of their last 10 games , he knew everything there was to know about @entity38			1
share the moment : the @entity7 players celebrate their first win of the @entity170 with their fans down : @entity125 ( top ) fouls @entity95 to give @entity38 a first half penalty incident : referee @entity113 gives a yellow card to @entity67 as @entity66 looks on back of the net : @entity7 's @entity63 ( left ) fails to save @entity95 's penalty the highest - ranked team in @entity179 certainly started positively against a @entity7 team burdened by a degree of expectation and a lack of experience on this stage			1
@entity158 have long been of the view that this group can emulate the side that reached the semi-finals in 1986			0
why they thought they could prove themselves fast learners and progress comfortably from a group that also includes @entity193 ’s @entity192			0
before long @entity7 did appear to be in command , dominating possession but finding life a little frustrating against opponents defending very deep			1
eventually @entity68 unleashed a blistering effort from distance that @entity86 could only parry			0
making history : @entity38 players celebrate their team 's first @entity43 goal in 28 years @entity72 failed to get a single touch of the ball inside @entity38 's penalty before being substituted - click here for more from our brilliant @entity2 service poor : @entity72 failed to touch the ball inside @entity38 's box during his 58 minutes on the pitch @entity213 : @entity95 celebrates with his team - mates after scoring his team 's first goal of the @entity170 it made the penalty they conceded all the more frustrating for @entity7 ; to have that much of the ball but find themselves a goal down after 23 minutes			1
there was no question of it not being a penalty , @entity67 allowing himself to get caught by the run of @entity95 in pursuit of a teasing @entity90 cross and committing the foul – a foolish foul – in desperation			2
it amounted to a dreadful piece of defending , with @entity66 certainly wasting no time in expressing his disappointment to his colleague			0
@entity95 ’s successful conversion not only ended that long wait for an @entity239 @entity43 goal but put the @entity158 under enormous pressure			1
@entity68 tested @entity86 again , while @entity67 endeavoured to make amends for his mistake with a free - kick that whistled over the @entity38 crossbar			2
struggle : @entity246 ( left ) struggled to make an impact for the @entity248 in the middle : @entity70 ( right ) flies through the air after being fouled by @entity92 @entity50 had endured a difficult first half , too , but he did burst clear at one stage and so nearly present @entity72 with the simplest of opportunities to equalise			2
as it was , @entity50 ’s delivery just eluded him			0
armed with a clipboard , @entity8 seemed ready to make changes at half - time			2
for all their possession – 66 per cent in that opening 45 minutes – they were alarmingly short of ideas , with @entity72 a lumbering , ineffective presence at the pinnacle of their attack			0
@entity266 was also among those who disappointed and a player already reflecting on a poor season for @entity126 – he was one of four @entity126 players to start this contest – was hooked during the interval , @entity47 stepping off the bench to replace him			2
ouch : @entity274 ( left ) scythes down @entity50 during a difficult first 45 minutes for the @entity248 @entity72 would not remain on the pitch much longer , losing his place to the relatively inexperienced @entity277			0
@entity146 when then make a further change , sending on @entity6			0
while @entity8 would have been alarmed to see @entity92 so nearly score a second for @entity38 , the introduction of @entity73 almost paid off when he accelerated into the box only to see @entity86 block his effort with his legs			1
in the end the breakthrough for @entity7 came from a @entity246 cross that @entity6 rose impressively to meet with a header that crashed home via the underside of the crossbar			1
it would be @entity69 who then made the crucial interception to spark the next attack , with @entity50 then bursting down the left flank before crossing into the path of the advancing @entity47			0
a moment of joy mixed with relief , and proof that , for all the disappointment of that first half , they have already gone one better than the @entity12 of four years ago			0
demanding : @entity7 coach @entity8 looks concerned on the touchline as his team struggle against @entity38 tussle : @entity70 ( left ) fights off @entity92 during the opening game in @entity310 my ball : @entity72 ( centre ) and @entity94 ( left ) battle for the ball during the first half			1

@entity47 comes off the bench to score winning goal for @entity7 against @entity38
@entity6 scored his first goal in 10 months to put @entity248 level
@entity95 scored @entity38 's first @entity43 goal for 28 years
@entity8 ' side struggled to see off first @entity310 opponents
