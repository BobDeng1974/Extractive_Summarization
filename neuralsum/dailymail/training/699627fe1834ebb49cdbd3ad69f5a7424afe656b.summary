@entity2 from @entity9 is one of the youngest children in @entity11 to suffer a stroke , which damaged 75 per cent of the right side of her brain			1
@entity2 , now two , still has little use of the left side of her body and wears a splint every day to support her left arm			1
unlike adults , for whom the greatest stroke risks are known to be smoking , poor diet and high cholesterol , the causes of childhood strokes are less clear - cut			0
her parents @entity27 , 45 , and @entity28 , 48 , believe @entity2 's was brought on by chickenpox			1
@entity28 , an it consultant said : ' @entity2 had a high temperature for eight days solid			1
' doctors thought it was an infection which caused it , but the likelihood is that she had chicken pox because our son @entity36 came down with it shortly afterwards			0
' instead of having a bleed on the brain which can sometimes happen in a stroke , her brain was starved of oxygen			2
@entity2 had the stroke on december 28 2011 and was in intensive care for five days			2
doctors told her parents to be prepared for the worst : ' we were told not to expect her to survive and the first 48 - hours were critical			0
' they got her in intensive care soon enough to try and preserve as much of her as possible			0
' me and @entity27 were told 95 per cent of the right side of her brain was damaged and her chance of survival was pretty slim			1
brave : despite @entity2 's ordeal , she and her parents @entity27 and @entity28 are determined that she should live as normal a life as possible ' it was a horrible time - we did n't expect her to survive			1
' when @entity2 came round she only recognised her mother @entity27 , causing more heartbreak for the family			1
@entity28 said : ' she did n't recognise me , so @entity27 spent the first week at the hospital comforting her			2
' it was extremely hard for me because @entity2 was a daddy 's girl beforehand , and she is again now she is recovered , but she just stared blankly at me			1
critical : @entity2 in the intensive care unit at @entity68 in december 2011 , two days after her stroke memory loss : when @entity2 came round she could only recognise her mother , much to her family 's heartache ' i kept going into see her at hospital and eventually she came round to remembering me again			1
' three months later @entity2 had another mri scan which showed the damage had reduced to 75 per cent as the bruising and swelling had gone down			2
one year on she has now defied doctors ' expectations not only to live , but to see , walk , run and cycle			0
her father said : ' she 's happy , cheeky and full of life			0
fighting for her life : @entity2 's parents were told 95 per cent of the right side of her brain was damaged and her chance of survival was slim ' the right hand side of the brain which affects understanding has been tested and her intelligence and she is beyond where she should be for her age			1
' injury to the left side of the brain , known as hemiplegia , will cause paralysis on the right side of the body and injury to the right side of the brain , like @entity2 's , affects the left			1
determined : she still has little use of the left side but she has persevered with her movement and speech @entity28 explained the extent of her injuries : ' she was completely blind in her left eye but she can now see across the room and walk , run , cycle			2
' although we are still trying to get her to use her left hand , arm and foot more , i think the main part of the recovery has been done			0
' her recovery has been way beyond anyone expected			0
' we are so grateful she is almost back to normal - she 's our little miracle			0
' @entity27 , a book keeper , said : ' @entity2 has come so far and we are thankful she is still with us			2
' she is a determined little girl who likes learning off her six - year old brother @entity36 by copying what he does			0
' there is n't much more we can do for her now but her recovery has been amazing			0
' although strokes are normally associated with older people , research shows that around 350 children and babies have a stroke each year in the @entity11			0
