by @entity1 medical correspondent a controversial scheme to get women to breastfeed in return for store vouchers amounts to ‘ bribery ’ , critics have warned			1
they say rewarding mothers who do n’t rely on formula milk could penalise those who ca n’t physically feed their babies			1
concern was also mounting the system could be abused after it emerged that mothers taking part will not have to demonstrate they are breastfeeding – instead their compliance will be ‘ taken on trust ’			1
sensible use of public resources : mothers taking part will not even have to demonstrate they are breastfeeding ¿ instead their compliance will be ¿ taken on trust ' it is feared that the feasibility study , aimed at finding ways to push up the @entity26 ’s low rates of breastfeeding , would not be rigorous enough to justify the use of taxpayer funding			1
@entity34 mp @entity33 said : ‘ this just does n’t seem like a sensible use of public resources			0
the reasons why women do n’t breastfeed are far more complex than this gives credit for – bribing women does n’t tackle that , it just encourages them to take the money			2
’ altogether 130 women in @entity45 and @entity46 taking part could earn up to £ 200 in vouchers for @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51			1
if the initial scheme is successful , it could be rolled out nationally			0
however , midwives and health visitors will sign off the form for rewards without actually observing the breast feeding			1
pilot : the scheme is being tested in @entity45 and @entity46 but could be rolled out nationally once the form - filling is complete , the mothers will receive the first vouchers in bundles of £ 40 over three weeks			1
a spokesman for @entity66 , which is running the four - month pilot , said : ‘ it is a trust relationship , but the midwife will know from conversation and working with the mum if she is breast feeding			2
’ currently one in four women does not attempt to breastfeed – one of the worst rates in the @entity79 @entity78 is funding the project , however , health minister dr @entity73 stressed he did not believe it was the best way forward			2
he said : ‘ breastfeeding has huge health benefits			0
but it should be a woman ’s choice to breastfeed and we know not all mothers are able to			0
professor @entity89 , of the @entity90 , said the initiative may penalise mothers who are unable to breastfeed			0
professor @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , said : ‘ this is a feasibility study – we do n’t know if it will be effective or not			0
it ’s worth finding out whether such a novel intervention might work			0
’ television presenter @entity99 , 42 , who has two sons and two stepsons , tweeted her disagreement with the idea			0
she tweeted last night : ‘ all day i ’ve tried not to tweet about this breast feeding vouchers idea , and say it ’s a f * * * * * * stupid bulls * * * idea , now i ’ve failed			2

critics say the scheme amounts to ' bribery ' and rewarding some mothers *discriminates* against those who ca n’t physically feed their babies
