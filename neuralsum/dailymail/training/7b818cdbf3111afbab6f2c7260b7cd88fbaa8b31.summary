by @entity0 robots are helping stroke victims to regain the use of their arms robots are helping stroke victims to regain the use of their arms			1
the machines work by supporting a patient ’s arm and letting them move it between targets on a computer screen , to build up their strength and improve their coordination			1
‘ rehabilitation robots ’ , which have been seen in a number of studies are being taken more and more seriously , with a major trial underway at @entity18 and @entity19			1
the stroke patient sits at a table facing a computer screen and places their arm on to the robotic device			1
a therapist then asks the patient to undertake some arm exercises , such as moving between targets on the computer screen			1
if the person is unable to move their arm , then the robot moves the patient 's limb for them			1
if the patient starts to move , the robot provides adjustable levels of assistance to help out , in turn helping the brain and arm to learn to work together again			1
@entity47 , professor of stroke care at the institute for ageing and health at @entity19 , leading the research , said : ' announcing the start of this clinical trial is a really exciting step forward for stroke rehabilitation research in the @entity56			2
‘ we have been looking at the research undertaken in the @entity59 and we are working closely with colleagues at the @entity61 ( @entity61 ) to see if robot assisted training is an effective treatment			2
‘ if shown to be effective , robot assisted training has the potential to change how we provide @entity67 rehabilitation for people with arm weakness due to stroke			2
’ @entity71 is one of 16 stroke services to take part in the five - year clinical trial and is one of the first in the country to use the new robot			0
the £ 250,000 rehabilitation equipment was invented by scientists at @entity61			2
a total of £ 3million has been given to the scheme by the @entity84 and a clinical trial in @entity59 has already shown that robot - assisted training may improve upper limb recovery			0
the stroke patient who has had a stroke sits at a table facing a computer screen and places their arm onto the robotic device ( pictured )			1
a therapist then asks the patient to undertake some arm exercises , such as moving between targets on the computer screen researchers from @entity19 will work in collaboration with teams from the @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 , as well as the @entity61 ( @entity61 ) and @entity67 stroke teams to test the equipment			1
dr @entity107 , principal research scientist and lecturer at @entity61 , said : ‘ the robotic technology we have developed at @entity61 is already helping many stroke patients and people with other neurological conditions in the @entity59 ‘ our focus is on helping clinicians to facilitate a functional recovery for their patients by using intensive and highly interactive robotic therapy			1
‘ by using robotics , not only do we get a greater understanding of the neuro recovery process , but we can also build a rich stream of data that assists in ongoing patient diagnosis and customisation of the therapy			0
’ from april , researchers began to recruit patients who had suffered a stroke for the first time to participate in the clinical trial			0
stroke sufferer @entity132 , 61 , from @entity133 , @entity19 , is one of the patients already taking part in the robot clinical trial			1
he had a stroke in march this year and spent around two months in hospital			0
now back at home , he continues to receive physiotherapy twice a week			0
mr @entity132 attends @entity71 three times a week for the 45 - minute sessions on the stroke robot as part of the trial			2
if the person is unable to move their arm , then the robot moves the patient 's limb for them ( pictured )			2
if the patient starts to move , the robot provides adjustable levels of assistance to help out , which helps the brain and arm to learn to work together again after only a few sessions into the 12 - week programme , he is already seeing improvements in his arm and shoulder			1
mr @entity132 , who used to work as a self - employed electrician , was unable to use his right arm or walk , but has gradually regained movement			0
‘ when you 've had a stroke , every bit of exercise and movement you can do is a big help , ’ he said			0
‘ using the robot alongside my other exercises is ideal for me and what 's great about the robot is that it also helps my hand - eye co-ordination			0
‘ i 've only had a few sessions so far , however i 've really felt the difference in my arm as i 've got a lot more movement and much more strength			0
‘ i 'm under no illusions that it 's going to be a lot of hard work but it 's all worthwhile because i know it 's going to make me better			0
‘ i 'm pleased to be taking part in the trial and helping people who suffer a stroke in the future			0

' rehabilitation robots ' are being trialled at @entity18 and @entity19
the machines , developed by @entity61 , work by supporting a patient ’s arm and letting them move it between targets on a computer screen
patients receive as much help as they need form the robot to build up their strength and improve their coordination
stroke victims report seeing improvements with just a few sessions
