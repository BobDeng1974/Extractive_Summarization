by @entity0 published : 23:32 est , 26 october 2013 updated : 23:40 est , 26 october 2013 a well - intentioned honest mistake could cost major @entity3 his position as a @entity7 reservist			1
maj @entity3 found himself in hot water last summer when he responded to an email from troops in @entity11 , @entity12 who were inquiring about a local police chief named @entity15 @entity16 was being given access to the base in @entity19 as part of the @entity23 military 's exit strategy from the country			1
maj @entity3 , pictured in the middle on the right , will face a @entity7 hearing as early as next month for accidentally emailing classified information via his personal email account maj @entity3 had prior knowledge of @entity16 , and immediately replied to warn his fellow marines about the dangerous police chief with ties to the @entity35			1
he also reported that @entity16 was a noted child abuser and there were allegations he sexually abused minors on @entity23 bases in the past			0
immediately after sending the email , maj @entity3 realized he had made a mistake and should n't have sent the message from his personal @entity46 email account			1
he reported himself to the @entity7 and is now facing judgement			0
he could face a @entity49 hearing as early as next month where he will need to argue his case for remaining a @entity7			2
but punishment for the email is causing an uproar among politicians and high - ranking military leaders since his email was a harbinger for a deadly attack carried out at the forward operating base in @entity19 by one of @entity16 's boy assistants			1
the assistant , who is believed to be one of @entity16 's sexual - abuse victims , opened fire in a base gym on august 10 , 2012 and killed three @entity23 soldiers : staff sergeant @entity69 , corporal @entity70 and lance corporal @entity71 warning : shortly after sending a warning email to soldiers in @entity11 about @entity74 , one of @entity76 's assistants shot and killed three soldiers on the base			1
above , the body of victim staff sgt @entity69 is brought back to the @entity23 maj @entity3 lives in @entity80 and in addition to being a @entity7 reservist , is a @entity80 fireman			1
@entity84 , maj @entity3 's lawyer who is working pro bono , said it was ' inconceivable that a combat @entity7 and @entity80 fireman , such as @entity3 , would have lied or stayed silent when marines in @entity12 sought his advice on an emergency force protection issue			1
' @entity80 senator @entity92 and representative @entity93 have both written letters backing their fellow @entity80			0
@entity95 called it ' unfair ' that @entity97 would be punished for his ' good - faith effort to warn his fellow @entity7			2
' the @entity7 and the ( @entity80 ) @entity99 need more good men such as @entity97 , not less , ' @entity95 wrote			0
other military leaders have come to @entity97 's defense , describing him as a model @entity7			1
@entity104 , a former assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs and who has written several non-fiction books about the military , said @entity108 ' has brass balls			0
we 'd like to believe that 's the definition of a marine , but i 've seen @entity3 in action '			0
he also described the time he saw @entity3 ' brace a punk police chief and drag away from a young teen who was being used as a sex slave '			2
@entity23 military in the area were able to convince the provincial governor to depose that police chief			1
doing the right thing : several politicians and high - ranking military officials have written to defend maj @entity3 's actions			1
above , another picture of the casks of the three @entity7 victims from the shooting at @entity19 being brought back to the @entity23 maj gen @entity132 , the commanding general of the @entity133 and brig gen @entity134 have also spoke up for @entity97			2
' @entity3 is a selfless , fearless and dedicated @entity7 officer			0
he accomplished much , for so many , with little regard for himself			0
i urge board members to take into consideration these aspects of his character and prior service in deliberations , ' maj gen @entity132 wrote			0
brig gen @entity134 called @entity97 a ' principled man of integrity who is not swayed by peer pressure or personal gain '			0
the @entity148 also published an editorial in favor of leniency for @entity97			0
' @entity3 's treatment sends the message that in the @entity7 there 's no room for honest mistakes			0
that 's a dangerous precedent to set in any line of work , but most assuredly in the military where even four - star generals will acknowledged that an understanding commander showed them some leniency along the way			2
' a spokesman for the @entity166 declined to comment on @entity97 's impending hearing .			2

major @entity3 faces a *disciplinary* hearing as early as next month for sending an email from his personal account containing classified information
maj @entity3 was trying to warn fellow soldiers about a shady police chief who was being given access to a @entity23 base in @entity12
one of the police chief 's assistants would go on to shoot and kill three soldiers at the base in august 2012
several politicians and high - ranking military officials have come to @entity97 's defense , saying he should be shown leniency for trying to do the right thing
