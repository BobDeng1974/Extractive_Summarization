forecasters confirmed yesterday that temperatures in some parts of the country could rise to the mid- 20s centigrade next week , thanks to the effects of @entity15 while the north - west extremes of @entity21 may be side - swiped by the remains of the storm that blasted the @entity24 earlier this week , the effect is that the rest of the country will benefit from @entity27 dragging in hot air from the continent			1
but before the barbecue weather emerges on monday , the wind and scattered showers are expected to last the weekend			1
northern and western parts will continue to be windy after gales battered the region yesterday – with some places in the highlands of @entity38 seeing gusts of 59mph			0

while the north - west extremes of @entity21 may be side - swiped by the remains of the storm that blasted the @entity24 earlier this week , the effect is that the rest of the country will benefit from @entity27 dragging in hot air from the continent a spokesman predicted it will then get warmer still next week , with the high pressure responsible for the @entity52 potentially holding out for an entire fortnight			1
she said : ‘ we could see temperatures hit @entity56 ( @entity57 ) to @entity58 ( @entity59 ) at @entity60 on sunday with highs in the 20s across the south and late teens in the north			0
‘ wednesday will be very warm in the south , we are looking at up to @entity67 ( @entity68 ) – but there might be some thundery outbreaks on thursday			2
’ but she added that the forecast remained optimistic : ‘ certainly until friday and saturday most places will stay dry and sunny with good temperatures , and after that it depends on what happens with the high pressure			0
the weather is due to change , just as children start returning to school ( file pic ) ‘ there is an indication it could build again the week after , meaning two weeks of settled weather			1
’ temperatures in the south are expected to hit the mid- 20s ( @entity87 ) by the end of the week and reaching @entity89 ( @entity90 ) elsewhere			1
with building humidity it could feel close to @entity93 ( 86f ) in some regions with even the far north getting close to @entity95 ( 79f )			0
veteran @entity97 forecaster @entity96 said ‘ there ’s another helping of summer on the way next week ’ , while @entity101 , a forecaster for @entity102 , predicted that @entity27 will ‘ shut the door ’ on any cold weather setting in at the beginning of september			1
he said : ‘ @entity27 will track over the @entity106 as a very deep depression this weekend , but will be well to the north of the @entity21 and move across @entity109			1
‘ the system will effectively shut the door on any cooler @entity113 flows for early september and initiate ridging and high pressure over the @entity21			1
‘ with a southerly flow developing later next week we may see some very warm temperatures , perhaps @entity119 ( @entity68 ) to @entity95 ( 79f ) in the south by next thursday and friday			2
’ and although this year ’s summer may have felt sweltering , the @entity40 said it is not likely to break any records			0
