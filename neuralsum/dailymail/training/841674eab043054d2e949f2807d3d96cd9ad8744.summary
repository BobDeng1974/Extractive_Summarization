a convicted sex offender has been arrested for allegedly molesting two sisters , aged 13 and 15 , after breaking into their home and threatening them			1
@entity3 , 33 , who was previously found guilty of child stalking , had removed his gps ankle monitor in september before entering the girls ' home in @entity8 , @entity9			2
he was later arrested in a public park and is now in custody on felony child molestation charges			0
@entity3 committed the crime after being arrested three times in two months last year on similar accusations			0
however , he was later released because @entity9 's legislation on parolees has been relaxed due to overcrowding in prisons			1
beating the system : convicted sex offender @entity3 broke off his gps device and allegedly molested two sisters in @entity8 , @entity9 before being rearrested he is one of thousands of child molesters and rapists on parole who are getting away with new crimes after disabling their gps trackers because they no longer fear lengthy jail time , recent figures have shown			1
in the past 18 months , there have been 3,400 arrest warrants in @entity9 , mostly for known sex offenders , after it was decided that parole violators should be put in county jail and not state prisons which are bursting to capacity			1
although the study is based solely on @entity9 prison statistics , across the @entity39 federal prisons are faced with the constant pressure of overcrowding , suggesting that similar measures could be introduced elsewhere			1
@entity39 's prison system is at breaking point - with overcrowding in the nation 's jails at its highest for eight years in 2012			2
there are currently more than two million @entity39 behind bars			0
the worst hit state is @entity9 which houses 140,000 inmates when its 33 adult prisons are only designed to hold a maximum of 80,000			2
overall , the @entity56 is around 39 per cent over ' rated capacity ' - their highest level since 2004 - with that figure expected to soar to 45 per cent above its limit by 2018			0
before the change to the system , parolees in @entity9 who re-offended were sent to state prison where they could be held up to a year - now many are freed within days or hours of arrest			1
the @entity68 declared @entity9 prison overcrowding unconstitutional in 2011 , immediately putting 30,000 convicted criminals up for transfer or release			1
repeat offender : @entity74 , 48 , was charged with sexual battery for assaulting a female student at @entity77 last year			0
he had been released twice earlier in 2012 on similar accusations @entity80 , from the @entity9 @entity79 , told the @entity81 this week that with little to stop them , ' parolees certainly are feeling more bold '			2
@entity9 law requires that sex offenders wear a gps device for life - however there have already been horrifying breaches of the system			1
according to the current wanted list posted online by the @entity92 , there are dozens of offenders who have violated the conditions of their parole by tampering with gps monitors			0
alarms go off when snapped , smashed or when a sex offender gets too close to a school or playground			0
in @entity103 , 42 sex offenders broke parole in the last 18 months			1
in one incident , sex offender @entity74 , 48 , was arrested on a college campus for assaulting a female student in the library			0
little threat : now that @entity9 is no longer placing parole violators in state prison , many no longer have prison time to fear and are cutting off gps ankle monitors ( stock picture ) he was arrested on november 14 last year but had been released twice in 2012 on similar allegations			1
the repeat offender remains in custody charged with sexual battery to which he has pleaded not guilty			0
proposals have been put forward by lawmakers that would require parolees who damage their gps bracelets to go back to jail for three years			0
however critics , point to the fact that there are simply no cells in the prison system to hold these offenders .			2
