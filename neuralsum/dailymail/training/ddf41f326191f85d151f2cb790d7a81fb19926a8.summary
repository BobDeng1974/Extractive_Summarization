by @entity0 published : 10:36 est , 27 may 2013 updated : 10:42 est , 27 may 2013 historians have recreated a 2,300 - year - old @entity4 log boat hand - carved from a tree trunk			1
more than 200 people helped fashion the one - tonne log boat over a three - week period from a section of fallen 80ft oak tree			1
the 15ft vessel is a scaled down copy of a 35ft @entity4 log boat discovered at the bottom of @entity14 almost 50 years ago			1
@entity15 has constructed a 2,300 - year - old @entity17 log boat over the course of three weeks in tribute to the one discovered in @entity14 in 1964 the original boat , discovered in 1964 , was discovered after routine dredging work but it is now only display at @entity24			1
visitors to @entity26 , the largest of eight islands in @entity14 , helped shape the flat - fronted boat using an adze , an ancient axe - like tool used for wood carving			1
two 4ft paddles were sculpted from the same piece of timber as the boat			1
for years it was kept submerged in fresh water to help preserve and protect it , but experts feared it could disintegrate			2
the original bronze age boat is preserved with sugar in @entity44 museum			2
thought to date back to @entity46 , it was accidentally uncovered in during dredging work in @entity14 historians spent many painstaking hours on the @entity26 island oak tree to convert it into an ancient logboat			1
they used an adze , an ancient axe - like tool used for wood carving , to make to boat more authentic the original boat is thought to have been built by the @entity57 , an ancient @entity17 tribe that inhabited @entity58 , to navigate @entity14 's 14 square miles of water the @entity60 in @entity61 spanned from @entity62 to 800bc			1
it is generally thought that the new bronze tools and weapons identified with this age were brought over from continental @entity67			0
the skulls recovered from burial sites in @entity61 from the @entity60 are different in shape from @entity72 skulls			0
this would suggest that new ideas and new blood were brought over from the continent			0
@entity77 and bronze can be used together , subject to the availability of both materials			0
true bronze is a combination of 10 % tin and 90 % copper			0
both materials were readily available in @entity61 at this @entity86 its entry into @entity61 , the @entity60 was in full swing in @entity67			0
the island of @entity90 was centre for the expansion of the bronze trade to @entity67			0

its replica will now go on display at @entity26			0
@entity105 , the island 's head ranger , said : ' the idea of building a log boat had been suggested a few times and then one day a huge oak tree was blown down			1
' it all came together and we thought it would be a fun , interesting and relevant project			0
' we cut the log to size and then enlisted the help of staff , volunteers and around 200 visitors to chip away at the log			2
' it took three solid weeks to make			0
when we launched the boat and it worked there was a huge sense of excitement , achievement and relief			2
' not only did the log boat float but it paddles very well			1
because of its weight it takes a little while to get going but once it does it works well			0

' historians said that building the replica using traditional tools was fascinating because it forced them to think like ancient man in order to overcome the same problems they would have faced over 2,000 years ago ' it felt like we were recreating something that had happened thousands of years ago			1
