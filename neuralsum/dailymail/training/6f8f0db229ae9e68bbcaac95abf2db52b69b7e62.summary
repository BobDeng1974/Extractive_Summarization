by @entity0 it can be easy to judge someone based on their taste in music			0
heavy metal - fans , for instance , are often thought to share a common sense of alienation , oppression and anger , with their music giving them an outlet for their rage			1
it ’s a stereotype that ’s reinforced by the genre ’s roots with metal gaining popularity throughout the 1960s and 1970s in economically ravaged , deindustrialised areas			2

ms @entity70 , who is @entity67 , claims @entity43 ’s love for heavy metal bands is directly related to the government 's efforts to put compulsory music training in schools			1
this , she claims , has created a generation able to meet metal ’s technical demands			0
‘ while new musical forms may spring from disadvantaged , disgruntled , or marginalised groups , ’ added mr @entity44 , ‘ it is the most advanced and wealthy societies that have the media and entertainment companies that can propagate new sounds and genres , as well as the affluent young consumers with plenty of leisure time who can buy it			0
