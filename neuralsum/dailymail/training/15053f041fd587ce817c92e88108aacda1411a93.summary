college tuition fees may have risen by more than 400 per cent since in the last 40 years , but the number of graduates has also increased dramatically			1
an interactive map uploaded by @entity4 shows the increase in @entity7 citizens obtaining a bachelors degree from 10.7 per cent in 1970 to 28.5 per cent in 2012			1
almost half a century ago , college graduates made up less than 10 per cent of the population in a huge number of areas across the country , the map shows			1
in 1970 only a small number of areas had more than 30 per cent of people studied for four years at college			1
these included the @entity20 , parts of @entity22 and @entity23 in only a few regions — the @entity20 , parts of @entity22 and @entity23 — did the number of people who had completed four years of college approach a third			0
by 1990 , there had been an enormous change with more areas showing an increase in the proportion of their citizens obtaining degrees			1
large parts of the northeastern and western coasts could boast that at least a third of their population were college graduates			0
in 2012 , the number increases again , with yet more areas showing a high percentage of residents achieving a bachelors degree			2
the dramatic increase across the country is surprising considering the substantial rise in college tuition			2
in 1970 for example , a @entity52 student would spent about $ 390 a year on tuition			0
today it costs around $ 6,000			0
the rise is also putting pressure on the job market and is causing thousands more to be left with mountains of student debt at the end of their courses			0
@entity64 reported that the percentage of @entity7 jobs that require bachelor ’s degrees to be somewhere between 20 and 35 percent			2
it means the market may not have enough employment opportunities for all the graduates			0
by 1990 , the picture had dramatically changed , with coastal areas showing a higher proportion of people obtaining a bachelors degree more than 40 years on from the first map , huge swathes of the country have a population where more than 30 per cent have studied for four years at college			1

images by @entity4 show the increase in @entity7 citizens studying from 10.7 per cent in 1970 to 28.5 per cent in 2012
forty years ago , only a small number of areas around the country had populations where over a third were graduates
by 1990 , there had been an enormous change with more areas showing an increase in citizens obtaining degrees
in 2012 , the number was higher again , but some believe the rise could lead to graduates *missing* out on jobs
