these stunning pictures show you exactly what it 's like to be ice - climbing while an avalanche crashes down a mountain			1
an adventure that few of us will ever experience first hand , photographer @entity7 , has captured the entire frightening , freezing ordeal			2
through the falling snow , the brave climber clings on to the side of the icy mountain as it showers over him			2
the spectacular pictures were taken by alpine climbing photographer , @entity7 , during a visit to the @entity26 near @entity27 , @entity24			1
the 31 - year - old , from @entity35 , set up his camera on a tripod and used a radio control to take the pictures while supporting his friend @entity40 's weight with a rope			1
@entity7 watched on as his daring pal took on the climb known as the ' hard ice on the rock , ' already knowing that there would be an avalanche			2
though the climber was almost 6 thousand feet high , he managed to hang on and make it safely through the snowfall experience climber @entity40 is half - way up the precarious frozen waterfall when an avalanche begins to fall @entity7 manages to support his friend 's weight with a rope while simultaneously snapping pictures with a radio control at one point @entity40 is complete engulfed by the falling snow and it is not known whether he has managed to hang on climbing photographer , @entity7 , took the photos via a radio control that he set up , while he supported his friend by holding the rope only when the snow begins to clear doe sit become apparent that @entity70 is still holding on to the frozen waterfall @entity7 said : ' it was snowing when we arrived so we knew that avalanches would be coming down			1
' ice climbing is always quite risky , but the shots are nice as they are quite atmospheric			0
' it was more like getting a very cold spray of ice and wind rather than anything life threatening			0
' of course that is totally dependent on the snow itself - in this case it fell as light powder so there is not much weight behind it			0
' i actually set the camera up on a tripod and had a radio control			0
' it 's something i do a fair bit when ice climbing actually as it means i can still climb but get nice ' third person ' shots as well			0
