@entity1 @entity0 has made his first public appearance in five weeks , ending a prolonged absence that fuelled speculation about his health and control over the country			1
the country 's official news agency said @entity0 ‘ gave field guidance ’ yesterday at the newly - built @entity11 , adding that he had also visited the newly built @entity12 of the @entity13 earlier in the day			0
the mystery over @entity0 ’s whereabouts for the past five weeks has deepened as a surprise new claim emerged suggesting he was receiving drastic weight loss treatment in @entity19			1
a source told the @entity21 that the 31 - year - old had spent the past few weeks in a @entity24 hospital having his stomach tied , or ‘ banded ’ , to help him fight his weight gain			0
last month it was claimed @entity0 has been putting his health at serious risk due to his dangerously high consumption of @entity32 cheese , which he got a taste for while a student in @entity35			1
he looked notably slimmer than he did during his last public appearance five weeks ago , amid rumours he has had a gastric band fitted last appearance : the @entity1 leader @entity0 was last photographed in public on september 3 at a concert ( above centre , with his wife @entity49 )			1
he has since missed several high - profile events @entity51 : @entity0 inspects a substance believed to be cheese at a @entity1 factory			1
a unhealthy appetite for imported @entity32 is believed to be a key factor in @entity0 's weight ballooning in recent months issues : while away from the public eye , @entity0 was reported to be suffering everything from gout , diabetes , a brain haemorrhage , a heart ailment , a leg injury , mental illness or a cheese addiction @entity0 had last been seen in the state media five weeks ago at a concert on september 3 , and he missed several high - profile events that he normally attends			1
an official documentary released late last month then made a single reference to @entity0 's ‘ discomfort ’ and showed video footage from august of him badly overweight and limping			2
now a reputable source , who has connections with intelligence agencies in the @entity78 , said @entity0 ’s no - show at the recent 69th anniversary celebrations of the ruling @entity79 was due to his recovery in a @entity19 hospital having earlier undergone a gastric band operation he has also been treated in recent weeks for sprains or fractures , to his ankles - a problem that developed after he injured a leg while joining troops in a military exercise in august			2
it has since been speculated that , as he continued to limp around , his weight added to the pressure on both legs , resulting in him seeking medical treatment for both that injury and his weight gain			0
a unhealthy appetite for @entity32 , also known as @entity35 cheese , is believed to be a key factor in @entity0 's weight ballooning in recent months			1
weight gain : @entity1 leader @entity0 got a taste for cheese while a student in @entity35			1
he is understood to love it so much that he imports vast quantities despite @entity110 sanctions @entity111 - un : @entity0 's five - week absence fuelled speculation about his health and even rumours of a coup			1
he made his return to the public eye yesterday , looking slimmer and assisted by a walking stick another photograph shows @entity0 during an inspection tour of a newly - built housing complex yesterday smiling : this photograph from @entity1 newspaper @entity124 shows @entity1 leader @entity0 during an inspection tour of a newly - built housing complex in @entity127 the mystery over @entity0 ’s whereabouts had deepened as a surprise new claim emerged suggesting he was receiving drastic weight loss treatment in @entity19 @entity0 has been treated in recent weeks for sprains or fractures , to his ankles - a problem that developed after he injured a leg while joining troops in a military exercise in august at the tour of the residential district , @entity0 praised the @entity1 's scientists as ‘ patriots who are devoting all their lives to building a rich and powerful nation , convinced that though there is no frontier in science , they have a socialist motherland and are under the care of the mother party			1
’ no fan of the limelight in his later years : @entity0 's late father , @entity153 ( above ) , would disappear at times many analysts believe that while @entity0 may have some health issues , he is probably not in serious trouble			2
but many other people wonder			0
experts believe @entity0 may have been deliberately gaining weight in order to look more like his late grandfather @entity162 , who is venerated in @entity163 as the nation 's founder and still holds the title @entity167 , despite having died 20 years ago			0
following the leader 's public re-emergence yesterday , the @entity168 in @entity169 , @entity170 , told the @entity172 that there was ‘ no doubt about it ’ that @entity0 was healthy			2
the ambassador ’s comment that @entity0 was healthy would still hold true even if the leader was in hospital , as stomach banding would be classified as cosmetic , rather than treatment for an illness			0
the @entity1 regime has made no mention of @entity0 being in @entity24 and the claim by the source - a former government official of a @entity189 country who retains close ties with @entity110 intelligence agencies - could not be independently verified			2
but @entity127 officials have admitted that @entity0 has been suffering ‘ discomfort ’ - while emphasising that he is still very much in control of the country			0
@entity0 's unhealthy obsession with @entity32 has led to him importing vast quantities of the cheese for his own consumption - despite millions of @entity163 struggling to find enough to eat			1
enemy : a @entity201 man watches a tv news program showing @entity0 using his cane yesterday not un-well : tv monitors in @entity201 show a news report about the health of the @entity1 leader			1
the captions mockingly refer to the ' @entity209 ' adored : earlier this year it was revealed that @entity0 tried to send a team of food experts to the @entity214 city of @entity215 for a crash course in dairy production so he would no longer have to import his cheese there 's also nothing particularly unusual about @entity1 leaders laying low for extended periods			2
@entity0 's late father , @entity153 , no fan of the limelight in his later years , would disappear at times ; @entity0 , who seems to genuinely like being at the centre of things , took off without a word for three weeks in 2012			2
malnutrition is widespread and famines often break out in the country , which is still reliant on foreign food aid as a result of economic mismanagement and the loss of @entity237 support in the 1990s			0
but despite the suffering of his 25 million citizens , @entity0 continues to gorge on @entity35 cheese in such vast quantities that his waistline is expanding at a dangerously rapid rate			0
earlier this year it was revealed that @entity0 tried to send a team of food experts to the @entity214 city of @entity215 for a crash course in dairy production			0
tired of his country 's bland attempts to produce a top quality local cheese the despot ordered the three specialists to spend several months at the @entity256			0
although the college ' politely but firmly ' rejected the request , @entity0 remains determined to improve standards at the country 's main cheese factory			0
he is understood to be furious that the @entity262 has continually failed to produce an @entity32 - style cheese of a high enough quality to satisfy his demands .			0

lengthy absence fuelled questions over the state of @entity0 's health
but @entity1 leader yesterday appeared in public for first time in weeks
reputable sources say he was undergoing weight loss treatment in @entity19
pictures appear to show that he has lost weight since he was last seen
@entity0 missed a number of public events because he was recovering in @entity24
claims come amid rumours @entity0 has been putting his health at serious risk due to a dangerously high consumption of @entity32 cheese
