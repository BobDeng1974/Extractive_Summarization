on sunday night , one of @entity2 ’s most famous faces completes more than 20 years of football punditry delivered with its own special brand of ‘ touch and technique ’			1
@entity8 fittingly hangs up his broadcast boots at the end of the biggest game in world football , in a country that simply oozes its love for the sport			1
a little while ago he decided it would be both the perfect match , and the perfect moment , to head into retirement with his latest @entity2 contract having fully run its course			1
his final appearance in the studio will come during the @entity2 's coverage of the @entity33 final between @entity34 and @entity35 at the @entity36 stalwarts : @entity8 and @entity38 ( right ) have become familiar faces on the @entity2 's iconic saturday night highlights show final line - up : @entity8 has announced the current @entity33 in @entity42 as his last for the @entity2			1
he is pictured here in a pre-tournament picture with ( from left ) @entity38 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 he was a class act as a footballer ; an elegant defender who helped provide the central spine of several great @entity54 teams			1
@entity8 retired shortly after his close friend @entity55 dramatically left @entity56 in 1991			1
a short break followed before ‘ @entity61 ’ had to decide which direction the rest of his life would take him , prompted no doubt by his lovely wife @entity63			0
some early work with a fledgling @entity65 and @entity66 opened up broadcasting as a possible future career path			0
he had already decided football management was n’t for him			0
i had known @entity8 for several years and was looking to put a new on - screen team together for the return of that regular saturday night institution @entity25			1
the much - loved programme was about to feature @entity76 football ’s new big thing , the @entity77			0
@entity8 was the perfect fit			1
he had a personal trophy cabinet full to bursting , was articulate and knowledgeable about his sport , and he was a handsome so - and - so			0
born winner : @entity8 , the @entity54 captain , holds the @entity82 aloft after beating @entity83 in the 1986 final at @entity85 sheer delight : @entity8 punches the air as @entity54 beat @entity88 1 - 0 at @entity89 to secure the @entity91 title in may 1986 never out of his depth : @entity8 after his first @entity94 triumph with @entity54 in 1978 early days : @entity8 alongside presenter @entity95 and fellow pundit sir @entity96 ( as well as some eye - catching ties ) during his first years on the show @entity8 joined the hugely - respected @entity95 and the wonderfully controversial @entity99			1
when the new series of @entity25 got under way , @entity8 was on board but learning a new craft			1
as editor of the programme i tried to assist him in his early shows			0
i said : ‘ @entity8 , i ’ve watched a thousand matches and you ’ve played a thousand matches , let ’s watch the same match being relayed into @entity113 on saturday afternoon and your target should be to spot something i do n’t and make that the subject of your analysis later on @entity25			1
’ not rocket science but hopefully a piece of sensible advice and one @entity8 ran with			2
he was flying solo within weeks			0
sitting in the studio gallery , i ’d watch him getting a little nervous as the famous titles were running but soon , guided by @entity95 , he was into his analysis and that familiar unmistakable delivery of ‘ pace and power ’ was off and running			2

he did n’t say things just for effect and was very much his own man			0
he was in it for the long term			0
saturday afternoons over the next few seasons became a favourite part of the week as @entity95 , @entity8 , @entity99 and @entity47 would enjoy banter , have a go in the sweep , over-indulge on wine gums and take their turn on the tea run , all the while watching that day ’s @entity77 action			2
helped by long - time colleague @entity187 , @entity8 established himself as a powerful advocate for good defending			2
teamed up with @entity159 again , he was an intelligent reader of the game and a perceptive judge of player and team — and all without a technical gizmo in sight			0
he even survived , with a smile , the memorable ‘ you ca n’t win anything with kids ’ remark that set @entity54 ’s arch - rivals , sir @entity202 and @entity203 , on course for the double ! whoops ! @entity8 's bold prediction that @entity203 would n't win anything with kids during the 1995 - 1996 season backfired spectacularly as @entity202 's team claimed a double of @entity77 title and @entity82 @entity212 : the @entity2 's team at the @entity214 in @entity129 - ( back row , left to right ) @entity99 , @entity216 and @entity217 ; ( bottom row , left to right ) @entity8 , @entity95 , @entity47 @entity8 : player and @entity220 , @entity221 , friday 11 july 10.35pm having started his playing career at @entity223 , @entity8 spent 14 years at @entity54 , a loyal servant to the club			1
in broadcasting he has done the same , spending over two decades with the @entity2 , sticking with them when occasionally contracts and people went elsewhere			2
when @entity95 moved to @entity229 , @entity8 built up a strong rapport with new presenter lineker that endures to this day — 22 years of loyal service with @entity233 , with just a brief ‘ loan spell ’ to @entity229 when he was spotted pushing a supermarket trolley around the aisles during the odd commercial break ! as well as his television work , @entity8 has been a consistent source of comfort and compassion for those people affected by the @entity244 disaster			1
special night : hansen with his wife @entity63 at the @entity246 in @entity247 last december cool customers : @entity8 and @entity164 don shades to promote the @entity2 's coverage of @entity252 's @entity33 qualifiers in 2001 @entity253 : @entity8 and @entity164 strip off to publicise the @entity2 's coverage of the @entity82 in 1997 he was in the @entity54 team that desperate afternoon in april 1989 and has been at the side of the distressed families from that moment since			1
his concern is as genuine as it is long - standing			0
@entity8 will slip into retirement from the media spotlight comfortably			2
he ’s left on his own terms with plenty of good memories behind him			0
he has a loving family around him , is never short of a golf match with @entity55 and will sit down on a saturday night and wait for that famous piece of music that heralds the start of a programme he has helped make his own .			2

@entity8 will hang up his @entity272 after this sunday 's @entity33 final
former @entity54 defender was a natural in front of the camera when he joined @entity2 22 years ago
has since become a stalwart on the iconic highlights show and famous for *unflinching* *opinions*
@entity8 won eight league titles , two @entity284 and three @entity285 with @entity54
