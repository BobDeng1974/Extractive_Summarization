security experts believe the black - robed killer ranting on the video has a distinct @entity6 accent , rather than another @entity1 person dubbing over the footage			1
the jihadist wears a black mask , concealing all but his eyes , making it difficult to be sure the voice belonged to him			1
but audio experts have claimed they are ‘ 99 per cent ’ certain the words were spoken by the man seen on camera			1
intelligence sources are understood to have identified the fanatic whose voice is heard on videos of the murders of mr @entity11 , @entity32 and @entity33 , and are trying to track him down in @entity35 with state - of - the - art military technology			1
jihadi @entity37 is thought to be one of 500 @entity1 muslims fighting with @entity41 to impose a caliphate in @entity35 and @entity43			2
because of the devastating impact of air strikes on is positions in northern @entity43 , jihadist leaders are increasingly suspicious of @entity49 fighters , amid fears they could be spies pinpointing enemy locations			2

hostages freed earlier this year said the killer was one of three @entity1 - born militants who held captives in @entity61 , @entity35 – who they nicknamed @entity37 , @entity63 and @entity64 after members of @entity66			1
jihadi @entity37 is said to be the most intelligent of the trio			0
he has taken responsibility for communicating with the outside world via negotiations with the prisoners ’ families and beheading videos			0
he also seems to have been in charge of security , reportedly ordering captives to be moved at least ten times to foil attempts to rescue them			1
@entity63 and @entity64 are thought to have been more junior , but together with @entity37 they carried out the most sadistic beatings			0
there were also @entity83 - speaking extremists among the guards , including at least one @entity85			2
but the @entity1 jihadists were the most feared because of their gruesome ‘ taste for the macabre ’ , according to a freed @entity83 hostage			0
the violence included beatings , use of @entity93 guns , and waterboarding – a form of torture where water is poured over a cloth blocking the nose and mouth			0
technology can eavesdrop on the jihadis ' conversations in places such as their @entity61 stronghold ( pictured ) they forced some of the @entity49 prisoners to take part in mock killings – @entity111 journalist mr @entity32 was forced to stand in a crucifix pose			0
the captives were also mostly kept underground in the dark , often shackled to one another			0
the first beheading video sent shockwaves across @entity1 as the killer spoke with a distinctive @entity120 twang and @entity6 appears to be his first language			1
linguistic experts believe the way he pronounced certain words , such as @entity43 place names , suggest he has a foreign language background – indicating his parents or grandparents may have come from the @entity130			1
he appears to have a skin tone consistent with @entity132 , @entity130 or @entity134 descent			1
academics claim @entity37 has a multicultural @entity120 accent , a kind of ‘ new cockney ’			2
the voice patterns will have been studied in painstaking detail by security chiefs desperate to glean his identity and match it with snippets of conversation picked up in @entity35			2
father of two @entity147 , a taxi driver from @entity148 ( pictured at a @entity35 aid camp ) was paraded at the end of a horrific new video showing the beheading of @entity1 hostage @entity11 – implying he will be next @entity154 fitted with sophisticated equipment , which can ‘ eavesdrop ’ on conversations taking place tens of thousands of feet below , are listening to see if they can pick up a voice match – potentially leading them to the location of the terrorist			1
however , his voice in the latest beheading video appears to be distorted , suggesting @entity41 are trying to disguise it			0
experts believe the killer is aged under 30			1
he is tall and slender , and appears to be left - handed			2
experts believe the killer is behind the final e-mail sent to the family of @entity32 ( pictured ) in the third beheading video his feet are not visible – different from footage of him murdering the two @entity111 when he wears modern desert boots			1
ex-captives have described @entity37 as intelligent , educated and a devout believer in radical @entity182 teachings			0
he is thought to be behind a final email sent to @entity32 ’s family , dated august 12 – seven days before the journalist was beheaded			0
in a hate - filled message , the jihadis vowed to kill mr @entity32 saying : ‘ you [ @entity111 ] and your citizens will pay the price of your bombings ! the first of which being the blood of the @entity111 citizen @entity32 ! he will be executed as a direct result of your transgressions towards us ! ’ experts said the language , use of capital letters , poor grammar and spelling mistakes supported the belief that the email was written by a working - class militant from @entity1			1
the fanatic has raged against @entity49 foreign policy – in particular @entity111 air strikes on is targets – in rants directed at @entity212 and @entity213 in his beheading videos			0
