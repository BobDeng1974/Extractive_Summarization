she is terribly relentless is n't she ? ! ' @entity1 , who has been chief of the @entity2 since 1999 , replied : ' terribly ! must keep her off your shaft ... graphite , sausage meat or flimsy sponge			1
' @entity1 , who lives with his wife @entity48 in a £ 1.8million home in @entity50 , @entity51 , has been at the forefront of promoting the growth of women 's football and said the league strives to be at ' the leading edge ' of the ' whole equality agenda '			1

' nonetheless i accept the contents are inappropriate and apologise for any offence caused , particularly to the former employee			0
it was an error of judgement that i will not make again			2

there are so many people working within the industry who are trying to make a difference , to help change the landscape and the future for women in sport			0
