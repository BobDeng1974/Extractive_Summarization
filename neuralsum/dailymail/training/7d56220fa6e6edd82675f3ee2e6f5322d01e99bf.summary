by @entity0 published : 14:24 est , 17 february 2014 @entity2 : 14:37 est , 17 february 2014 three former @entity4 employees have been charged by the @entity5 over allegations they rigged @entity8 interest rates			1
@entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 are accused of conspiring to defraud between june 1 2005 and august 31 2007			1
the arrests come more than 18 months after @entity4 was fined £ 290m for rigging @entity8 , which is used to set mortgage rates and trillions of dollars of financial contracts around the world			1
scandal : the bank was fined £ 290m in 2012 for rigging the @entity8 interest rate ( file photo ) the @entity5 launched a criminal probe into the scandal shortly after the fine was announced			1
@entity9 and @entity10 left @entity4 in september 2012 while @entity11 left in 2006 after four years at the bank			1
the three were among 104 names of current and former @entity4 employees who tried to keep their identities anonymous as part of a legal case brought by @entity30			1
the charges take the total number of individuals facing criminal proceedings for their role in the libor scandal to just six , despite a number of banks including @entity39 and @entity40 being hit with huge fines			0
no - one has yet been jailed			0
@entity43 , a former trader at @entity44 and @entity40 and brokers @entity45 and @entity47 were charged last year			0
the criminal proceedings against the @entity4 alumni comes as it is also being investigated by regulators over whether it manipulated foreign currency rates			1
the arrests will come as an unwelcome distraction , with the bank under pressure to justify a bumper pay hike for investment bankers and lay out its plans to turn around performance			2
review - @entity62 , managing director of the @entity63 , said the @entity8 rate itself needed a ' complete overhaul ' following the scandal which implicated a number of banks the decision by the scandal - hit lender to increase its total bonus pool by 10pc to £ 2.38bn has put it on a collision course with shareholders			2
@entity4 ( up 3.05p to 256.05p ) has kicked off a two - week charm offensive to attempt to pacify investors ahead of its annual general meeting in april			1
the @entity80 giant is desperate to avoid a backlash , particularly as shareholders have this year been given binding votes that allow them to block remuneration reports			0
a key issue at @entity4 ’ investors ’ roadshow is likely to be why it sanctioned big increases in bonuses despite disappointing performance			1
its ‘ casino bankers ’ enjoyed a 13pc pay rise , sharing bonuses of £ 1.57bn between them			2
the huge windfall , which equates to £ 60,100 on average , was unveiled last week and came as the investment bank ’s profits slumped 37pc to £ 2.5bn			2
the key ‘ compensation ratio ’ - pay as a proportion of revenue - rose from 39.6pc to 43.2pc , despite @entity103 ’ pledge to reduce it to the mid- 30s over the next few years			0

@entity103 added that @entity4 has been struggling to attract and retain some of its top talent , particularly when competing against @entity117 and @entity118 rivals			1
he indicated that he had received the approval of some the bank ’s biggest shareholders			0
but analysts predict many investors will be less understanding when given the chance to vote on the pay packages at the annual meeting			0
describing the bonus hike as a ‘ poke in the eye for investors ’ , @entity131 from @entity132 said : ‘ @entity4 has not done itself any favours with the increase in the bonus pool , particularly at the investment bank			1
it has a lot of work to do to convince investors that they needed to pay more to retain top staff and must provide evidence of the revenues these top staff are generating			0
’ he added : ‘ @entity4 also needs to convince investors about its plans to boost performance at the investment bank			2
it has its work cut out ’			0
