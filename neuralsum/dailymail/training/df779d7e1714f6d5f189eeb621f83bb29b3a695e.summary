by @entity0 published : 19:43 est , 16 december 2013 updated : 13:09 est , 17 december 2013 most people would rather tell a lie or do a bad deed if asked than face the social discomfort of saying no , according to a new study			1
researchers said we tend to underestimate the extent to which we can all ' influence someone else 's ethical behaviour '			0
people urged to tell lies or commit minor acts of vandalism were much more likely to do as asked than those who made the request anticipated , they found			1
the research echoes @entity19 's classic work , which found many more people than participants anticipated were willing to obey a scientist and administer a deadly electric shock			1
@entity19 is pictured here , second from the right , in the 70s the @entity27 authors of the study , from the @entity29 in @entity30 , said people may agree to do bad deeds to avoid the awkwardness of refusing			1
alternatively , people might choose to see such unethical acts as simply being helpful to others or a way to win popularity			2
' instigators failed to recognise the social pressure they levied on actors through simple unethical suggestions , that is , the discomfort actors would experience by making a decision that was inconsistent with the instigator 's suggestion , ' they wrote			0
lead author dr @entity47 and colleagues carried out a series of experiments for the study , published in @entity52			1
first they asked 52 students to estimate how many people they would have to approach to find three willing to lie by signing a form saying the participant had given them a verbal introduction to a new course			2
participants guessed they would need to ask 8.47 people on average before three agreed but it turned out they only needed to ask around half as many - 4.39			2
more than nine out of ten students overestimated how many people they 'd need to ask			0
the @entity27 authors of the study , from the @entity29 ( pictured ) in @entity30 , said people may agree to do bad deeds to avoid the awkwardness of refusing in a second study 25 participants estimated how many people they 'd need to ask before three agreed to vandalise a library book by writing the word ' pickle ' inside in pen			1
participants thought they would have to ask nearly 11 people on average but in fact approaching just 4.7 people on average was sufficient			1
two further studies used hundreds of people recruited via @entity90 's @entity89 online survey website , asked to imagine they were either the ' actor ' , the ' instigator ' , or a neutral party in a range of hypothetical scenarios			0
they included buying beer for underage children , illegally downloading a film and claiming expenses on personal dinners			0
people playing the actor said they 'd feel a lot more uncomfortable if a friend or colleague nudged them toward behaving unethically , compared with advising them to behave ethically			0
but those playing the instigator or a neutral party did not anticipate this difference			0
researchers said this shows we underestimate people 's willingness to comply with unethical requests because we fail to take their perspective			0
the research echoes @entity19 's classic work , which found many more people than participants anticipated were willing to obey a scientist and administer a deadly electric shock .			2
