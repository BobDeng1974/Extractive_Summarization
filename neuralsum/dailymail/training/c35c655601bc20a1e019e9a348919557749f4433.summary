‘ i ’d have a breakdown , ’ she replied			0
‘ there is nothing my mum could have said or done to have made us go back to @entity19			2
i do n’t understand why he would want to put mum into jail			0
this is just too much			0

after the hearing , ms @entity2 , 48 , said she felt ‘ pleased and relieved ’			1
but she added : ‘ this victory , if that is what it is , feels very hollow , because at the heart of this terribly sad matter are five children who are no longer together as a family as they should be			0
‘ it is so hard on all of them			0
they should be together , playing and smiling and doing all the things siblings do together			0
i will never give up fighting to reunite them			0
