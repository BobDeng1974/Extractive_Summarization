trooper @entity9 insisted he does not even know @entity10 , the wife of fugitive @entity12 's older brother , a source close to the investigation told @entity14 exclusively			1
police had earlier said the two — who live less than half a mile apart in @entity16 , @entity17 — may have known each other and that @entity12 , who is being sought after 15 days on the run , may have thought they were having an affair			1
trooper @entity9 ( left ) insisted he does not even know @entity10 , the wife of fugitive @entity12 's older brother , a source close to the investigation told @entity14 ' @entity9 said he had not even met her , ' said the source			1
' of course we do n't know what @entity12 believed			1

@entity9 , 31 , remains critically injured in serious but stable condition following the september 12 shooting which killed his colleague , father - of - two corporal @entity42 , 38			2
if @entity12 had believed the trooper was involved with his sister - in - law , it could help explain why he drove 25 miles to the @entity47 police barracks to carry out his deadly attack rather than pick a target closer to home			1
yesterday the @entity52 , along with state troopers , continued the manhunt for @entity12 in a wooded area at @entity55 in @entity17 but police believe he picked @entity47 because it is isolated and allowed him to hide in the woods to shoot , whereas other police stations are closer to areas of population			1
they insist that it is mere coincidence that one of the shot men lives just a stone 's throw from his brother			2
early in the investigation cops ' aggressively interviewed ' @entity10 as rumors of the affair circulated			0
' we have investigated the rumor of the affair thoroughly after we learned about it , @entity73 police spokesman trooper @entity72 told @entity14 earlier this week			1
' there is no truth to the affair			0

we have a clear mission with specific objectives — protect the community , find you and bring you to justice			0

@entity112 and @entity52 have a heavy presence in the area before that they have said he has approached the perimeter of their search area , staying just far enough away that officers could not get a clear shot at him			0
they say dogs flushed him out at one stage but he was far enough away to flee			0
@entity31 said he believes the search has now become a game for the military simulation fan			0
to him , it 's a game — a war game if you like , ' the top cop said			0
on saturday the @entity162 reported that cops had discovered a jacket they believe belongs to @entity12 in the woods , along with protein bar wrappers			1
the previous day , the same paper said sources had told it cops had discovered bombmaking equipment in @entity12 's parents ' home — a claim that @entity31 implicitly accepted — and that @entity12 had tried to call his parents on september 18 and the ' ping ' from his cellphone had helped cops locate him			1
@entity31 also revealed that @entity12 had bought equipment that would help him build a bunker in the woods			2
however he said the intensive search had failed to discover that bunker			0
heavily - armed officers with combat gear and night vision have spent days looking through the woods he also said that searches of a computer that @entity12 used had shown that he had been planning the attack for at least two years			2
he said the computer showed he had researched how to avoid police manhunts , law enforcement technology and survival skills			0

@entity208 material found in @entity12 's parents home advise the wearing of diapers to allow someone to stay in place for extended periods			1
@entity12 is known to be obsessed with @entity205 , a country he has visited at least once			0
he was a member of @entity213 — which translates to @entity214 — a military simulation team which reenacts battles from the @entity218 civil wars of the 1990s			0
despite police assurances that @entity12 is contained in an area bounded by @entity123 and @entity222 south of @entity135 , they continue to search other areas			2
around 11 p.m. on friday night a helicopter with a bright blinking light flew over woods a few hundred yards west of the search area			0
suddenly the light was extinguished and the chopper continued to fly in darkness as a convoy of heavily armed police sped to the site ' they soon came back , obviously having found nothing , ' a man who watched the scene unfold told @entity14			1
earlier the same day hundreds of police descended on the abandoned @entity238 at @entity55 , four miles north of the main search site and spent more than half a day in an intensive search of the 400 - room property and its grounds			0
@entity12 is known to be acquainted with the crumbling hulk of a building , which has become a hangout spot for bored local teens since its closure in 1991 .			0
