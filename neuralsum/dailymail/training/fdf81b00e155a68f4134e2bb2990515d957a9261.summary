saturday dawned bright and cold over @entity0 and in the local media talk of @entity3 's future was to the fore again			1
in the @entity6 there were suggestions that a millionaire from @entity9 may be interested in buying the club from @entity11			1
peculiarly , he did n't have a name			0
former @entity3 striker @entity14 revealed that he has been using his time working in @entity16 to sell the prospects of the club to the wealthy in the @entity19			2
@entity3 fans are upset with the way that owner @entity11 is running the club ' but try as i might to encourage one of the sheikhs to invest , i find it difficult , ' he lamented			1
in the @entity28 pub near @entity0 new street station , @entity3 fans seemed understandably unexcited			2
' we need a new owner , ' said @entity32 from @entity33			2
' more urgently than that , though , we need a new manager			2
much more of this football and people will just stop going			0
' saturday was another hard day for boss @entity39			2
he was booed as @entity3 lost to @entity40			1
the planned ' eight - minute ' protest on the @entity42 did n't happen but @entity39 knows how people feel			1
' we have n't scored for eight hours , have won 17 home games out of 67 and @entity39 wonders why we are moaning , ' said @entity46 , of the @entity48 website			0
' we are a big club and going nowhere			0
i look at clubs like @entity51 and ask myself : " why is that not us ? " ' @entity3 competed well with @entity40 for 20 minutes in the second half			1
that apart , though , @entity3 were poor			0
@entity39 ( left ) has seen his @entity3 side go goalless for over eight hours now @entity54 impressed , as did @entity55 for a spell and , sporadically , @entity57			0
those close to the club say the latter two players will leave in the summer while another well - placed source says @entity11 has never recovered from the acrimonious nature of @entity64 's departure in 2010 and suffers from never having appointed a man with football experience to the board			1
' after @entity64 , @entity11 appointed @entity68 and then @entity69 , ' said the source			1
' the @entity64 thing almost paralysed him and he made two bad appointments that have cost the club time and a lot of money			0
' @entity55 was one of @entity3 's best players against @entity40 but could leave the club in the summer for now @entity39 is seen to be the problem and things may get worse			1
next up in the @entity80 are @entity81 and @entity82			0
on the platform at @entity86 station on saturday evening , two @entity40 fans asked if i supported @entity3			1
' you must do , ' said one			0
' you just look so fed up			0

there were boos at @entity42 after 2 - 0 *defeat* to @entity40 on saturday
fans want to see a new owner at the club and a new manager
a planned ' eight minute protest ' against owner @entity11 did not happen on saturday
