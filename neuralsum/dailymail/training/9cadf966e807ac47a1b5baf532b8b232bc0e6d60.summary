by @entity0 published : 17:22 est , 3 may 2013 updated : 19:54 est , 3 may 2013 @entity2 ’s local election results were described as worse than those achieved under @entity4 in 1981 – two years before he led the party to a crushing general election defeat			1
@entity9 insisted he was ‘ pleased ’ with the polls , which saw @entity2 win an additional 291 seats , reversing some of the losses made when the councils were last contested , under @entity14 in 2009			1
however , experts noted that the figures did not represent the gains normally achieved by a party on the march to power			2
@entity4 led the @entity2 to a crushing defeat in 1983 , after he had disappointing local election results @entity2 gained control of just two councils : @entity26 and @entity27 , which it lost in 2009			1
it failed to take back @entity30 and @entity31 , which were also lost four years ago , or @entity32 , another key target			2
there were few signs of a revival in the south of @entity38			0
education secretary @entity39 said the results were worse than those achieved in 1981 , when @entity2 won @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 as it picked up almost 1,000 seats			1
its projected share of the vote was 41 per cent then , compared with 29 per cent this week			0
mr @entity39 said : ‘ when @entity4 was leader of the opposition they won @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity30			1
they are not winning them now			0
@entity9 said he was ' pleased ' with the polls , despite only gaining two councils ‘ what is really striking is that people are not voting for @entity2 in anything like the numbers they need to be on course for government			1
’ a @entity2 source said it was ‘ ludicrous ’ to compare yesterday ’s result with 1981 , when the @entity60 @entity59 was not a factor – but @entity2 ’s grassroots found little to cheer			1
@entity63 , editor of the @entity65 website , said : ‘ i can safely say that today ’s results are not the boost that @entity9 hoped for			1
’ @entity68 , of @entity70 magazine , agreed that the failure to reverse the losses of 2009 was deeply disappointing			0
‘ @entity2 needs to be performing much better if it ’s to stand a chance of governing alone after 2015 , ’ he said			1
@entity74 , professor of politics at @entity76 , added : ‘ the scale of progress , in truth , will disappoint the party			2
@entity2 ’s share of the vote was up by 8 per cent on 2009 , but still 5 per cent below the result in 2005 when they won the general election			1
’ nevertheless , mr @entity9 said the party had performed well in spite of @entity59 ’s surge			1
‘ there are still lots of people saying : “ can anyone turn this country around ? ” ’ he said			0
‘ i believe @entity2 can			2
’ the results come after a difficult month for mr @entity9 , whose poll lead over the @entity96 has halved amid public concern over his soft stance on key issues			2
his opposition to the popular cap on benefits has been particularly controversial			0
similarly , despite lobbying from senior figures including shadow chancellor @entity104 , the @entity2 leader is against a referendum on @entity107 – making the party ’s disaffected voters a target for @entity59			1
@entity2 insisted yesterday that it had done well in target seats such as @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 , crucial battlegrounds for the next election			1
a source said : ‘ this shows we are well on the way to victory in 2015			0
’ the @entity2 leader is against a referendum on @entity107 making the party 's disaffected voters a target for @entity59 and @entity128 @entity2 received an unexpected victory in @entity130 , the heart of prime minister @entity133 's constituency @entity2 was also cheered by an unexpected victory in @entity130 , at the heart of @entity133 ’s constituency , where a strong @entity59 showing pushed the conservatives into third			1
anti-coalition sentiment also hurt the @entity140 , who lost more than a quarter of their council seats			0
it suffered the worst losses of the three major parties and came seventh in the @entity147 by - election			0
across the 34 councils holding local elections , the @entity140 lost 124 seats and were left with 352 – a loss of 26 per cent			0
however , the party insisted it remains strong in the areas where it has mps			2
@entity158 ’s party had hoped to make gains in areas such as the south - west where @entity96 support is flagging			2
however , it lost out to @entity59 in @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166			0
it did , however , make gains in @entity32 , @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity171			0
mr @entity158 said : ‘ of course , it is not good to lose hard - working councillors , but the @entity140 are on a journey			0
‘ we are on a journey from a party of protest to a party of government , and actually the pattern that has emerged shows that , where we have mps , where we have @entity140 out on the doorstep setting out our side to the story , communicating our message , we are holding our own and in some areas making gains			0

@entity2 's election result were as *bad* as @entity4 in 1981
@entity194 then led the party to a crushing defeat two years later
@entity9 insisted he was ' pleased ' despite only gaining two councils
