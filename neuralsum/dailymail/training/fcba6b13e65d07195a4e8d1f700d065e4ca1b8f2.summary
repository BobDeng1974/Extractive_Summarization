the most corrosive love - hate relationship between two brothers since @entity2 had nine million tv viewers on the edge			1
the rivalry between the @entity7 boys reached new intensities last sunday , as @entity9 drugged his older brother @entity10 to steal a laptop full of government secrets — and was ordered to go on a suicide mission as punishment			1
if the dynamic between the siblings took a more central role than ever , then that was no accident			2
for as @entity19 , who co-produces the show , says : ‘ @entity10 is a very complex character			1
somehow , he ’s the key to @entity9			2
’ key player : @entity24 and @entity25 play battling brothers @entity9 and @entity10 , a relationship inspired by @entity24 's own childhood how true — and in more ways than one			1
for ‘ @entity10 ’ read ‘ @entity24 ’ , the 47 - year - old actor who plays him			1
here is the man who is key to understanding the whole @entity9 revival			2
for what many casual fans do not realise is that in addition to starring in the series , @entity24 is also its co-creator and chief scriptwriter			1
to have created , written and starred in the most succesful @entity41 drama series for years would be a remarkable enough , but that is by no means @entity44 ’s only claim to fame			1
indeed , last year saw him become one of the most successful actor - writers of his generation			2
in addition to @entity9 , he was heavily involved in the 50th anniversary celebrations for @entity52			2
having written for the show ever since its revival under scriptwriter @entity55 , @entity24 penned @entity56 — a drama about the doctor ’s early days at the @entity41 — as well as two new episodes of the latest series			1
he adapted and directed an @entity62 ghost story , which was a highlight of @entity65 ’s @entity64 schedule , as well as writing and presenting a documentary about the author			2
complex character : @entity24 is not only playing @entity7 , he also created the show with @entity19 , produces it and writes the script @entity19 , who co-produces the show , says : ' @entity10 is a very complex character			1
somehow , he 's the key to @entity9 ' an episode of @entity76 ’s final series similarly came from his pen			2
oh , and all the while he has been starring in a sell - out production of @entity81 ’s @entity80 at the @entity82 — the latest in a line of classical theatre roles			2
that he has also written three novels , based around the adventures of a detective called @entity89 , is almost surplus to requirements			2
small wonder , then , that one broadsheet newspaper this week used one of its editorial leader columns to declare @entity44 ‘ a national treasure ’			2
such popular acclaim might never have come his way had it not been for a passing comment made on a train journey from @entity100 to @entity101 in 2009 , when @entity24 was travelling with @entity19 , his long - term collaborator on @entity52			1
@entity24 remarked on the coincidence that in 1881 , when the first @entity106 story appeared , dr @entity104 was a war veteran who had been wounded in @entity107			1
nearly 130 years later , the @entity108 was fighting in the same distant outpost : perhaps , he mused , a modern - day @entity104 was there			2
‘ it was a lightbulb moment , ’ @entity24 says			1
what followed was the most critically lauded tv show in years , and one which saw the affectionate loathing between @entity9 and @entity10 develop to a new intensity			1
in one telling scene at the start of the latest series , @entity10 picked up a large white teapot and announced : ‘ i ’ll be mother			1
’ to which @entity7 retorted : ‘ and there is a whole childhood in a nutshell			1
’ such psychologically laden lines have prompted some to suspect that @entity24 has commandeered one of literature ’s best - loved heroes for some personal family therapy			1
for @entity24 ’s own childhood was marked by a complex relationship with his parents and a bitter rivalry with his own older brother , all set against a truly gothic backdrop that was to inspire his lifelong fascination with the macabre			1
when @entity24 was born in @entity144 , @entity145 , in 1966 , his brother @entity143 was three years old			1
they grew up in the village of @entity148 , north of @entity149 , where their father was a mining engineer			2
as the pits closed , his father joined his mother working at the psychiatric hospital opposite their home			2
@entity24 and @entity19 came up with the idea of @entity9 while on a train to @entity101 after having worked on @entity52 in @entity100 the hospital , once known as @entity161 for the @entity162 , became @entity24 ’s second home			1
he and @entity143 used the swimming pool there , had their haircuts done by staff , and watched films in the hospital ’s cramped cinema			0
one of @entity24 ’s earliest memories is of seeing @entity173 , surrounded by people whose illness had left deep marks on their faces			1
‘ i was almost as frightened of the people sitting around me as of the @entity179 [ the film ’s villain ] , ’ he recalls			0
‘ the faces and personalities were true northern gothic			0
’ he acknowledges that it also explains his adult obsession with monsters , demons and derelict buildings : ‘ it definitely left its mark			0
i ’ve always liked the macabre			0
‘ i was always drawn to the supernatural , anything odd			0
i liked “ stepping out of the sunshine ”			0
’ to the young @entity24 , his father was a forbidding figure			1
‘ i realise now that was mainly because he worked so hard			0
he was n’t unkind , but he was a presence			0
when our mum said , “ wait till your father gets home ” , it definitely worked			0
’ but it was his relationship with his brother that left the most lasting scars			2
the boys detested each other and fought frequently			0
though they would stick up for each other in playground scraps , at home , @entity143 would punch and bully his little brother			0
‘ we only stopped hating each other recently , ’ @entity24 says			1
‘ we never had anything in common			0
he was painfully shy and found his expression in lashing out at people			0
’ @entity24 , meanwhile , found another escape : the stage			1
during his first year of drama college , he met @entity224 , @entity225 and @entity226			0
the four began writing and performing a ghoulish sketch show called @entity228			2
it developed into a radio sitcom about the inhabitants of a morbidly gruesome village on the remote @entity233 , a backwater called @entity234			0
the motto on the village signposts promised ‘ you ’ll never leave ’ , and the population of serial killers , psychopaths , cannibals and lunatics made sure of that			0
after the show won the @entity246 at the @entity247 in 1997 , it transferred to @entity248			2
all the actors played multiple roles , often in drag			0
@entity24 ’s best characters included @entity253 , the butcher who kept cuts of human flesh for special customers ; @entity257 , the cleaner with a disgustingly lurid lovelife ; and @entity260 , the obedient housewife whose husband is obsessed with bodily functions			1
such dark humour would hardly make @entity44 the natural choice to pen the revival of a children ’s classic			0
but having been obsessed by @entity52 as a child , he had supplemented his wages as an actor in the early 90s by writing four doctor who novels			0
redbeard : the young @entity9 appearing in flashbacks , bullied by an adult @entity10 , was played by @entity24 's co-creator @entity19 's son when the show was revived for tv by producers @entity55 and @entity19 , @entity24 was the first writer they hired			1
his first episode featured @entity282 as @entity283 , starting a pattern that has seen @entity24 cast actors that he admired in his youth as stars for his projects			1
the credits for his @entity64 dramatisation of @entity62 ’s spine - chilling story @entity293 read like a geek ’s dream dinner party : there was @entity297 , who starred with @entity298 in @entity299 ; former doctor who assistant @entity300 ; @entity301 from @entity302 , and @entity303 , the former @entity304 actor who did a famous drag double act called @entity306 and @entity307 with comedian @entity308			0
murder and mystery have been a recurring theme : @entity312 , inspector @entity313 , @entity76 , @entity314 , @entity315 … @entity24 has been involved with them all , as writer or actor			1
his fascination with @entity320 and dickensian horror spills over into real life			0
at the @entity324 house he shares with his civil partner , actor @entity325 , he constructed a mad scientist ’s laboratory in the cellar , complete with blood - red walls , yards of glass tubes with coloured liquids bubbling over bunsen burners , and a stuffed cat			0
he met @entity325 , who is eight years his junior , online			0
he claims it is the younger man ’s pristine spelling and grammar that attracted him			0
they were married in 2008 at the @entity338 in the @entity339			0
@entity24 says he always knew that he was gay , though he had a girlfriend as a teenager , and that he accepted his real sexuality after a single afternoon of self - doubt			1
‘ i do n’t think i was ever “ in ” with my friends , ’ he says			0
coming out to his parents was , however , much harder			0
it was only after leaving home that he plucked up the confidence to tell his mother the truth			0
she begged him to say nothing to his father , and promised she would break the news herself			0
a year later , @entity24 realised they had dealt with the problem by denying it to themselves , and he had to go through the ordeal of coming out all over again			1
that taught him , he says , never to put off difficult emotional decisions			0
@entity24 ’s open homosexuality has led some to detect a gay frisson between his characterisation of @entity7 and @entity104			1
it ’s a running joke that @entity367 and his colleagues regard 221b @entity369 as a gay love nest , and in the latest series landlady mrs @entity371 was incredulous at @entity104 ’s protestations that he was getting engaged … ‘ to a woman ’			0
purists have balked at such liberties with @entity378 ’s creation , but they are part and parcel of @entity24 ’s creativity			1
homosexual undercurrents , vicious sibling rivalry , gothic shadows : these are the ingredients of his adolescence which today underpin his adult success			2
his next role — as a banker called @entity390 in the @entity393 drama @entity391 — has helped heal the rivalry with his brother			0
after decades of animosity , the two are back in contact and @entity24 says @entity143 , now a postman , was ‘ so excited ’ to hear @entity24 has a part in the show that he loves			1
it is a remarkable rapprochement			0
but then , as fans of @entity9 will know , even @entity10 has moments when his little brother makes him proud .			1
