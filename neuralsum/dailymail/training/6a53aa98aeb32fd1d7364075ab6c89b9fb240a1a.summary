a mother - of - three fell victim to a rare flesh - eating bug twice , leaving her fighting for her life after giving birth to two of her children three years apart			1
in december , shortly after giving birth to her daughter @entity9 , @entity8 fell into a coma			1
the bacterial infection @entity11 ( @entity12 ) was ravaging the 33 - year - old 's body , eating away at her body			1
' the bug ate away at the fat and muscle in my stomach and hip , ' she said			1
' it looked like a shark bite			0
ms @entity8 ’s first pregnancy passed without incident			0
but in september 2010 , while 34 weeks pregnant with her second baby , she developed a pea - sized lump on her thigh			1
' i did n’t know what it was , ' she said			0
' but two days on it was dark and was the size of a melon			0
' i was taken to hospital and was so delirious i asked doctors to chop my leg off			2
the bacterial infection necrotising fasciitis ate away at her stomach and legs , pictured , leaving crater - like depressions ms @entity8 , a full - time mum , was given painkillers and antibiotics but slipped into unconsciousness			1
she woke up 10 days later to find a huge area of infected flesh had been removed from her thigh			2
her baby , @entity29 had been delivered by emergency caesarean – though she was initially so delirious that thought he had died			2
it was another three days before ms @entity8 was allowed to see her baby - as doctors warned she was still infectious			1
and even then she was unable to hold her son			0
she said : ' i just said , " hello my baby boy " and stared at him			0
' @entity29 ' traumatic arrival meant it took some time for ms @entity8 to bond with her son			2
the ordeal left her needing a 12 - inch skin graft to repair the crater left in her leg			0
having recovered , the 33 - year - old thought everything had gone smoothly when she gave birth to her youngest child , @entity9 , in december			1
but just days after her birth , ms @entity8 's stomach began to blister and she was rushed to the @entity84			1

' following further surgery , ms @entity8 was discharged from hospital at the end of january and is now recovering at home in @entity84 , @entity95			2
she said the whole experience has left her fearing the extensive cosmetic surgery she needs to repair her badly damaged skin			0
doctors say they are baffled as to why she developed the disease twice			2
@entity101 said : ' @entity11 ( @entity12 ) is a bacterial infection that affects the soft tissue and fascia ( a sheet or band of fibrous connective tissue separating or binding together muscles and organs )			1
ms @entity8 first developed the infection after giving birth to her son @entity29 in 2010			1
at 34 weeks pregnant she noticed a pea - sized lump on her thigh , which spread to the size of a melon within two days			1
she fell into a coma , waking 10 days later thinking her baby had died ' it can occur following a cut or some other opportunity for the bacteria to enter the body , such as surgery			1
' the bacteria can also enter through weakened skin , like a blister			0
sometimes there is no obvious entry point ' @entity12 is a rare but serious condition			2
' one of the early signs is intense and severe pain which may seem out of proportion to any external signs of infection on the skin			0
' there may be a small cut or scratch on the skin , for example , but the pain will be very bad			0
' as it progresses , fever , diarrhoea and vomiting can develop , with the person eventually falling unconscious as the infection overcomes them			0
