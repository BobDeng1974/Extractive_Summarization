good neighbours do n't just make good friends - they may also reduce the risk of suffering a heart attack , according to a new study			1
current evidence suggests that the characteristics of an area in which a person lives can have a negative impact on their cardiovascular health - such as the density of fast food outlets ; levels of violence , noise , and pollution ; drug use ; and building disrepair			2
however , few studies have looked at the potential health - enhancing effects of positive local neighbourhood characteristics			0
a study into more than 5,000 @entity25 adults with no known heart problems found that those with a good support network in their community had a 22 per cent reduced risk of having a heart attack ( file picture ) the new research tracked the cardiovascular health of more than 5,000 @entity25 adults with no known heart problems over a period of four years , starting in 2006			1
their average age was 70 , and almost two - thirds were women and married			0
in 2006 they were asked to score on a validated seven point scale how much they felt part of their local neighbourhood ; if they felt they had neighbours who would help them if they got into difficulty ; whether they trusted most people in the area ; and if they felt they were friendly			0
potentially influential factors - such as age , race , gender , income , marital status , educational attainment , outlook and attitude , social integration , mental health , lifestyle , weight , and underlying health issues , such as diabetes and high blood pressure , were all taken into account			2
during the four year monitoring period , 148 of the 5,276 participants had a heart attack			0
the researchers said that a strong social support network of friends and family , including neighbours , has been linked to better health ( file picture ) analysis of the figures showed that each standard deviation increase in perceived neighbourhood social cohesion was associated with a 22 per cent reduced risk of a heart attack			1
the researchers said the association held true even after adjusting for relevant socio - demographic , behavioural , biological , and psycho - social factors , as well as individual - level social support			1
they say their findings echo those of other studies which have found a link between well integrated local neighbourhoods and lower stroke and heart disease risk			2
the researchers admitted that some potentially important risk factors - such as family history of heart disease or stroke and genetic influences - were not known			0
however , they said a strong social support network of friends and family has been linked to better health , so friendly neighbourhoods might be an extension of that			1
@entity106 , of the @entity107 at @entity108 , said : ' perceived neighbourhood social cohesion could be a type of social support that is available in the neighbourhood social environment outside the realm of family and friends			1
' the researchers also suggested that tight - knit local communities may help to reinforce and ' incentivise ' certain types of cohesive behaviours and so exclude anti-social behaviours .			0
