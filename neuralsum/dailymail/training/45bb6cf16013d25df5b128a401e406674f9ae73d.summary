making the world ’s thinnest material in a blender , simulating tsunamis and creating a cloak to render a person entirely invisible sound like ideas straight out of a sci - fi film			1
but scientists will today reveal their progress in turning these dreams into a reality			0
@entity14 ’s top researchers will address an audience of 2,000 at the @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18 , to present the fruits of their ‘ high - risk , high - gain ’ labours , which have received millions of euros in funding from the @entity23			1
the event will be live streamed at 13:15 gmt. one scientist will show how the world 's stongest material , graphene ( an atomic - scale model is pictured ) , can be made in a kitchen blender at the @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18 today last week , scientists announced that they had discovered a new property of graphene – the world ’s thinnest and strongest material - that could trigger an electric car revolution but in order to make use of the discovery , experts must first discover how to make industrial quantities of the ' wonder material ' , which could be used for everything from flexible touchscreens to condoms			1
today , professor @entity46 , of @entity47 , @entity48 , will reveal how graphene can be made in a kitchen blender			1
together with his team , he has found a way to produce incredibly thin sheets of graphene , a nanometre thick , by using powdered graphite , which is found in pencil lead			2
to do this , he mixes the powder at high speed with an ‘ exfoliating liquid ’ to produce thin ‘ monolayer flakes ’			1
professor @entity62 , of @entity63 in @entity64 , has been working for 15 years on making @entity66 ’s invisibility cloak a reality by using optics			1
a still is shown from the film dr @entity71 , an expert in earthquake engineering at @entity73 , has created a tsunami simulator after seeing the chaos caused by the tsunami that devastated @entity77 in 2004			1
her tsunami generator at the @entity80 hydraulic research station in @entity81 is 230 ft ( 70 metres ) long and 13 ft ( four metres wide ) and produces long wavelengths linked to tsunamis			1
it contains a plethora of instruments to enable scientists to examine the way tsunami waves hit coastal defence structures and buildings , mirroring what happens in real life			1
it could be used to inspire new building designs which could survive the natural disasters while the team has produced grams of the material so far , professor @entity46 said the method could be scaled up to produce tonnes of perfect graphene sheets			1
they are working on using the technique to create ‘ industrially important ’ materials too			0
invisibility cloaks will also be discussed at the event			2
professor @entity62 , of the @entity63 in @entity64 , has been working for 15 years on making @entity66 ’s invisibility cloak a reality using optics			1
he explained : ‘ i work on connections between optics and quantum optics with ideas from general relativity – on the geometry of light			0
‘ applications include experimental analogues of the event horizon , invisibility cloaking , and perfect imaging			2
’ today , he will explain how he is pushing the laws of optics , which govern how light is bent and pass through lenses , to its limits , in a bid to develop an optical cloaking device			2
invisibility cloaks could one day have obvious applications , such as hiding spies and military vehicles , but the professor told @entity136 that his research could also shed light on the mysteries of dark energy , which is a repulsive force that physicists know very little about			1
he said : ‘ ideas that may seem outrageous can be pursued			0
if they are right they should be taken seriously , however peculiar they may seem			0
the significant thing is what they teach us			0
’ dr @entity71 has created a tsunami simulator after seeing the chaos caused by the tsunami that devastated @entity77 in 2004			1
this image shows a woman walking through the remains of her home while professor @entity62 will explain how his work could unravel mysteries of the universe , dr @entity71 , an expert in earthquake engineering at @entity73 , will detail how she is working to save lives on @entity163			1
she set about creating a tsunami simulator after seeing the chaos caused by the tsunami that devastated @entity77 in 2004			1
many experts doubted it could be done because there is a shortage of data about rare tsunamis and the waves are so long they are incredibly difficult to model			0
but she persevered to develop a lab - based model that will be used to change how buildings can be designed to survive tsunamis			2

@entity189 scientist dr @entity188 is studying the ocean and its deep sea corals to predict how it may change in the future in the face of global warming			0
stock image of a coral reef shown she said the tool ‘ allows us to contribute to a revolution in how we design buildings			1
it combines engineering with seismology , structural dynamics and even the social sciences			0
’ her aim is to ‘ save lives , and in doing so build a safer world for our children ’			0
@entity189 scientist dr @entity188 of the @entity211 , is studying the ocean and its deep sea corals to predict how it may change in the future in the face of global warming and will also explain her research at the event this afternoon			1
her team has examined coral skeletons and sediments to analyse abrupt climate changes in the @entity220 over the past 30,000 years , collecting data to show how deep - sea ecosystems are affected by changes in the ocean such as the concentration of carbon dioxide and water circulation			1
‘ it is only through looking at the history of the earth 's climate that we can predict what might happen in the future , ’ she said			2
she hopes to discover the conditions required for cold - water deep - sea corals to survive in the central @entity220 in order to work out a way to protect species that are vulnerable to changes in ocean chemistry , using cutting - edge geochemical techniques			0
scientists have discovered a surprising new property of graphene – the world ’s thinnest and strongest material – that could accelerate the development of electric cars and other green technologies			2
researchers have found that the newly discovered type of carbon graphite , which is found in pencil lead , allows positively charged hydrogen atoms or protons to pass through it			0
their discovery could increase the efficiency of fuel cells for cars , because the cells generate electricity from hydrogen			0
the researchers , led by @entity267 winner sir @entity266 of @entity268 , who discovered graphene , said their finding raises the possibility that , in future , graphene membranes could be used to ‘ sieve ’ hydrogen gas from the atmosphere to generate electricity			2
this is because the one - atom thick material acts like a filter to allow protons to pass through it , while blocking the passage of other atoms			0
at just one atom thick , graphene is the thinnest material on @entity163 and is also 200 times stronger than steel			0
it was first isolated in 2004 by sir @entity266 and his fellow researchers , who received a @entity267 in 2010 for their work			0
the material is impermeable to all gases and liquids , giving it the potential for a range of uses such as corrosion - proof coatings , packaging and even super-thin condoms .			0

some of @entity14 ’s top researchers will address an audience of 2,000 at the @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18 to explain their ' high - risk ' research
professor @entity46 , of @entity47 , @entity48 , will show how graphene can be made in a kitchen blender with ' exfoliating liquid '
another expert will describe his 15 - year quest to create an invisibility cloak using @entity317 's theory of relativity and optical *trickery*
the event will also focus on a tsunami simulator that could be used to design more resilient buildings and coral climate research
