by @entity0 published : 08:36 est , 6 february 2013 updated : 04:50 est , 7 february 2013 @entity2 's half - time extravaganza at the @entity3 may have impressed fans but her raunchy leather - clad performance failed to pull in more viewers than @entity9 's record breaking 2012 appearance			1
in fact , fewer people watched sunday 's thrilling @entity3 than the previous two championship games , according to figures released on tuesday			1
although @entity2 , who prepared for five months for the hotly anticipated gig , reunited @entity17 and sung live , viewing figures showed the 31 - year - old was watched by 104 million viewers , compared to @entity9 's audience of 112.5 million			1
scroll down to watch both performances @entity22 ... but not in viewing figures : @entity2 failed to beat @entity9 's 2012 ratings for her half time show what did you think of @entity2 's @entity3 performance ? @entity29 , a company that tracks the ratings , reported the actual game drew 108.4 million viewers , which is a drop from last season 's tally of 111.3 million viewers			1
@entity9 's performance in 2012 , which sparked controversy after @entity40 swore at cameras , was criticised on @entity42 but its lavish nature - the slot featured @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 - meant the show was certainly noticed			1
nearly half of all households that own a television were tuned into sunday 's game , the company added			1
massive gig : @entity9 , seen performing with @entity46 and @entity40 , spoke out about the @entity56 rapper swearing during the @entity3 halftime show last year branding it ' negative ' the showdown , where the @entity60 defeated the @entity61 , scored a 46.3 rating and 69 share in its overnight ratings			1
for the @entity29 measurement , one ratings point represents 1,147,000 households , or 1 percent of the nation 's estimated 114.7 million tv homes			1
the share means that 71 percent of tvs that were on at the time were tuned to the @entity3			2
oblivious : @entity9 said she did n't know about the swearing until she had left and was on the way to the airport how rude ! the 36 -- year - old rapper was seen swearing into the camera during the live broadcast of the show at @entity82 ' request the ratings figure from last night did not include a 30 - minute period when there was a partial power outage in the @entity85			1
but viewership actually increased after the power outage , as the game measured a 52.9 rating during its final moments , @entity82 noted			0
not surprisingly , @entity60 ranked first among cities watching the championship game			0
the game drew a 59.6 rating and share of 83 there			0
in second place was @entity97 , where the game was played			0
the contest drew a 57.1 rating and a 77 share			0
@entity102 : this year 's @entity3 's half - time show comes in at second in the most watched league @entity106 did not rank in the top 10 cities for viewership			1
the network also drew criticism by the @entity111 for not moving quickly enough to edit out a profanity said by @entity60 quarterback @entity113 shortly after the game			0
@entity113 was caught by microphones describing his team 's victory as ' f --- --- awesome			2
' the game also illustrated the explosive growth of second screen activity			0
the company @entity122 , which tracks activity on @entity42 , @entity124 and other social networks , estimated there were 47.7 million social media posts during the game			2
that compares to 17 million during the @entity130 and just 3 million the year before that			2
last year 's @entity3 , when the @entity132 beat the @entity133 , drew a @entity29 rating of 47.8 and had a share of 71			1
