scientists have said medics can expect ' an upswing in what on the surface appear to be heroin overdoses ' , but that are actually caused by the new opitate			0
the drug - a relative of the powerful prescription painkiller , fentanyl - is being mixed into street drugs marketed as heroin			1
scientist @entity22 , from the @entity23 and @entity24 at the @entity25 , said : ' what 's frightening about this emerging street drug is that users themselves may not be aware that they are ingesting it			2
' a patient may report heroin use and have symptoms consistent with heroin overdose , but an emergency physician may find that the standard dose of antidote - naloxone - does n't work			0

' one of the many downsides of illegal drugs is you just ca n't trust your drug dealer			0
' the trend of adulterants being worked into street drugs to make them more potent is dangerous			0
' the significant potential for overdose of acetyl fentanyl necessitates more medical research and policy reform			2
