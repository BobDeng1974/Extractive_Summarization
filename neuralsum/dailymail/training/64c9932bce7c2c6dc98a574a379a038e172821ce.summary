@entity0 failed to properly inform a young woman of the risks of laser eye surgery then spied on her in a bid to prove she was lying about how damaged her eyesight was			1
@entity7 's eyes were so sensitive to light following the operation to correct her short - sightedness she was forced to wear sunglasses everywhere and light her home with candles			1
but the 28 - year - old from @entity14 , @entity15 , was followed by private investigators hired by the company in a bid to dismiss her complaints that the surgery had ruined her life			1
@entity7 ( pictured left with her mother ) needs to wear sunglasses constantly after being left sensitive to light following the botched operation by @entity0			1
dr @entity28 ( right ( was ' extremely busy ' at the time of the operation , the court heard , and barely had time to properly inform her of the risks the high street chain was ordered to pay more than £ 500,000 in damages for the mistake at @entity35			1
miss @entity7 had been ' enticed ' into a branch an @entity0 branch in @entity38 in 2008 after seeing an advert on television for eye surgery which claimed it cost £ 395			1
but when she contacted the company , they quoted her a price seven times as high			0
in the end she paid £ 2,790 for the procedure			1
despite her reservations , miss @entity7 was coaxed into getting the surgery by an optometrist who , the court heard , said he had had the procedure himself and his eyesight was ' brilliant '			2
confidential guidance the chain had given to its staff encouraged them to tell customers they were ' in excellent hands ' and to ' reduce price objections ' with encouragement			0
after paying a £ 200 deposit , she waited for five hours for her first appointment with a surgeon who was ' extremely busy '			0
dr @entity28 said though she had little memory of their meeting , she would have warned @entity69 that hers was a difficult case and that surgery might not necessarily correct her problems			0
but the judge insisted there was ' no way ' the woman could have given miss @entity7 all the relevant information in that small of a time			2
an hour before her surgery , she was told to sign a consent form which was inappropriate , according to the judge who said : ' that is not how things should be done '			0
' it was like a conveyor belt			0
i was under a lot of pressure			0
the lady did not leave my side , i was literally told to sign the form and i did what i was told , ' miss @entity7 told the court			2
after the operation the woman said that ' everything was hazy ' and she felt ' sick and shocked '			2
she went back to the branch and was told by an optometrist not to be concerned and to keep taking the drops			0
when miss @entity7 sought a second opinion , one expert said it was the worst case of photophobia he had encountered , and wrote : ' i 'm sorry i 'm not able to offer her any further treatment			2
' she was forced to use candle light in her home , because electric lights were too bright for her to bear , and can only sometimes manage to read large print			0
the company was ordered to pay £ 500,000 in damages to @entity69 who said her life had been ruined by the ordeal after having to rely on friends to take her to buy food and run errands for fear of falling , the former book dealer said she thought life was ' hardly worth living '			1
the court heard @entity0 used private detectives to covertly film her over three days in august to try and dispel her claims			2
they followed the woman driving her car , shopping at a supermarket and even through the windows of her own home			0
ruling both @entity0 and dr @entity128 liable to pay full compensation , the judge said miss @entity7 had at no point been given sufficient information about the risks of the surgery and possible complications in order to give ‘ informed consent ’			1
the company was told to pay a total of £ 569,287 , including £ 30,000 for @entity69 ’s ‘ pain and suffering ’ and over £ 400,000 for her lost earnings			0
speaking after the court ruling , @entity7 said : ' i would urge people considering laser eye surgery to really think it through carefully , that you have a decent surgeon and to make sure you are aware of all the risks beforehand			1
