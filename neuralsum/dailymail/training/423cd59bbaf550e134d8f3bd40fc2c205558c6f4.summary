@entity0 was applauded as she was hailed an apprenticeship ambassador at the @entity3 conference , but has not heard from the party since she was one of eight ‘ ordinary ’ voters whose story of struggle was said to have inspired @entity8 and his fight against the @entity10			1
indeed , when she was twice asked to stand and receive a round of applause at the @entity3 conference last september @entity0 was feted as the face of new apprentices			1
and the @entity3 leader was clearly so smitten with the 21 - year - old from @entity18 that within hours it was announced he wanted her to be an ‘ apprenticeship ambassador			0
’ but it seems that @entity0 has been rather forgotten by the @entity3 leader and his team			2
yesterday it emerged that @entity0 has become fully qualified as an auto - electrician and been given a job by the @entity27 transport firm after finishing her apprenticeship studies at @entity29			0
but it was also revealed that she has heard absolutely nothing from mr @entity8 and his team about becoming their much vaunted ‘ ambassador			2
’ interviewed by broadcaster @entity35 on his @entity37 breakfast programme yesterday she was asked about @entity39 ’s plans for increased apprenticeships for the young			0
she praised the @entity39 scheme but then she said : ‘ you know i ’ve still not heard back from @entity8 regarding being an apprenticeship ambassador so i ’m not sure yet who i will vote for			1

‘ i met somebody called @entity0 the other day , ’ he excitedly told the audience			0
‘ where is she ? she ’s here			0
@entity0 why do n’t you stand up for one second … ’ since the conference @entity66 has qualified as an auto - electrician after finishing her apprenticeship studies at @entity29 - but said she may not vote for @entity8 after he failed to contact her mr @entity8 then called for a second round of applause for miss @entity0 during his rambling speech and later she was told that he definitely wanted her to be a @entity73			1
’ the suggestion that the @entity3 leader wanted to ‘ promote ’ miss @entity0 was widely reported at the time of the @entity77			1
but shortly after her appearance she perhaps showed some prescience about political promises when she was asked who she might vote for in may and replied : ‘ you ca n’t really say until they are in power - when they go back on the words they say			0
i ’m keeping an open mind to see what ’s best for me personally			0
’ last night a @entity3 spokesman said : ‘ we have spoken to @entity29 about @entity0 since september and we will be contacting her directly			0
