by @entity0 a 55 - year - old convicted murderer serving a life sentence in @entity4 state prison is fighting in court for the right to have conjugal visits with his multiple wives			1
polygamist inmate @entity9 , who is @entity10 , said the prison 's policy against such visits is a violation of his constitutional right to freedom of religion			0
on tuesday , a @entity18 judge allowed @entity9 to proceed with his case , shooting down the @entity21 's call to for a blanket dismissal			0
imprisoned polygamist : @entity9 , an inmate at the state prison in @entity25 , @entity4 , claims a ban on conjugal visits with his multiple wives is a violation of his constitutional right to freedom of religion while judge p. @entity31 says @entity9 did n't prove his constitutional rights had been violated by the prison 's policy , he believes there is still a case to be made under the federal @entity37 , which prohibits measures that prevent prisoners from worshiping freely			1
@entity9 has been behind bars at the state prison in @entity42 since 1990 , after being convicted of murder in @entity44			1
after spending more than two decades in prison , @entity9 says his wives are threatening to divorce him within their religion on the basis that they ca n't have sex with him			1
it 's unclear how many wives @entity9 has since the number is n't specified in court documents			1
he also says the policy is discriminatory against heterosexual inmates since homosexual prisoners can have intercourse freely behind bars			2
@entity9 is also fighting other prison policies including the limited use of prayer oil , rules on who inmates can and ca n't call as well as the presence of female prison officers			2
trouble at home : after spending more than two decades in prison , @entity9 says his wives are threatening to divorce him within their religion because they ca n't have intercourse			1
above , a still from @entity73 television show @entity71 , which followed a fictional @entity75 polygamist family in @entity76 he told @entity77 that the ' presence of female correctional officers causes him emotional stress ' which is a cruel and unusual punishment			0
the @entity21 has countered @entity9 ' complaint , explaining that each of the policies is in place for security reasons			0
they point out that conjugal visits are n't allowed in most state prison systems , and that prayer oil is used by inmates to mask the smell of illegal drugs and is also flammable			2
currently , no two prisoners are allowed to have the same contacts on their call lists , which @entity9 believes is a violation of his right to free association			0
but @entity21 points out that inmates have alternative means of communicating with people in the outside world - like writing letters			0
if they want to win their case , judge @entity31 says the @entity21 must prove that there is a legitimate security reason for their policies and that they are the ' least restrictive means available to accomplish the objective			0
