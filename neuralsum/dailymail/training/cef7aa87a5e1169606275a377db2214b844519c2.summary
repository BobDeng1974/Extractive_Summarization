by @entity0 published : 05:08 est , 9 july 2012 updated : 10:01 est , 9 july 2012 a police force cutting 620 jobs and shutting some of its stations ' frittered away ' almost £ 500,000 on consultants paid to consider its ' culture ' and ' customer journey '			1
@entity9 's decision to splash out so much money despite chopping £ 126 million off its budget has been branded ' astonishing ' by one @entity13 mp			1
@entity15 's @entity14 , who represents @entity16 and sits on the commons ’ @entity18 , said : ' the force is facing the biggest cuts in its history and this year is the worst year of all			2
anger : @entity16 mp @entity14 , left , says the spending by @entity9 's chief constable @entity25 , right , is ' wrong ' ' this is entirely the wrong time to be frittering away cash on consultants			1
how is all this money available for consultants when we are losing police officers hand over fist ? ' i am astonished they need to bring in outside people to tell them about their own culture			1
' it would be helpful if the force could provide a succinct briefing of what it is paying consultants to do			2
' @entity43 took evidence on the issue of consultants at the force and the chief constable was not able to explain what they do			2
' details of the spending - a total of £ 485,000 - emerged in a report to the @entity54			1
the document , called ' external expertise to support key programmes , projects and initiatives ' sets out plans to spend the cash after the force conceded it could not do the work in - house			1
cuts : prime minister @entity66 with @entity67 chief constable @entity25 , right , following last year 's riots in @entity13			2
the force is cutting millions from its budget the projected costs include a £ 75,000 budget for a review of customer service and £ 80,000 for finding out more about the ' customer journey '			1
a sum of £ 70,000 was set aside to conduct a study on the culture of the force			1
the culture audit will include workshops with staff			2
the report said the consultants would ' discover details of the current culture at the force and analyse the valuable and distinctive features of the current culture for retention and development			0
' in march , the force announced more than 300 jobs would be axed , including 85 police officer posts			0
a first wave of cuts was made last year and led to the loss of 173 police officer posts and 217 civilian jobs as the organisation faces £ 126 million - worth of budget cuts			1
@entity100 , chairman of the @entity101 , which represents rank - and - file officers , said : ' i would question spending this amount of money on consultants when we are losing so many police officers			1
' i have no idea what the studies are , but i will certainly be interested to find out			0
' another @entity13 @entity15 mp @entity112 , said : ' it ’s a lot of money that could be used to keep police officers in their posts			1
' i am bemused that we have to bring people in			0
surely there are senior officers within the force that can write reports about the culture inside the force ? ' @entity9 today defended the use of external consultants and claimed they actually helped save money and improve the ' services ' the force can provide			1
deputy chief constable @entity131 said : ' the details of proposed consultancy was contained in a report to @entity54 that the force produced as part of its approach to openness and transparency			0
' we accept employing consultancy can be very controversial in a very difficult financial climate and ensure we make sure this information is available to the public			0
' the current requirement for savings is requiring the force to work very differently			0
in some areas we have the skills to make these changes ourselves and in other areas we need support			0
' using specialist consultancy can be effective , provided we use their support to improve our skills to carry out this work ourselves in the future			0
' we have carried out major reviews using consultants that have directly helped achieve savings and have improved the services we provide			0
' @entity162 is always about supporting the ideas of our own people			0
' the proposed consultancy is not about an exotic experiment in culture			0
it is about understanding the experience of the public and improving how we deal with people by improving how we are working			0
' very clear expectations are always set before money is spent on consultancy and these sums will be no different			2
