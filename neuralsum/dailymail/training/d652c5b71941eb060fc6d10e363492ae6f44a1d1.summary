by @entity1 reporter published : 22:20 est , 11 june 2013 updated : 22:20 est , 11 june 2013 too soon ? as outrage continues to build over the @entity7 's controversial @entity6 , in which the federal government collects the electronic communications of average citizens , the nation 's highest intelligence official is yucking it up about what many consider to be an unconstitutional violation of the @entity18 citizenry 's right to privacy			1
foot - in - mouth - prone director of national intelligence @entity20 spoke at a black - tie dinner honoring former @entity24 and @entity7 chief @entity23 on friday night and - just days after admitting that he 'd provided false testimony to @entity27 in regards to the @entity6 - started cracking jokes about reading people 's emails			1
@entity32 - waka ! director of national intelligence @entity20 already is cracking jokes about the federal government 's controversial @entity6 program ' some of you expressed surprise that i showed up , ' @entity20 quipped , according to the blog @entity39			1
' so many e-mails to read ! ” but @entity20 's comedy show was just getting started - shortly after the line about reading people 's emails , he tackled another controversial topic - du - jour			1
last week - much to the ire of the airlines , pilots unions and @entity27 - the @entity50 removed pocket knives from its list of prohibited items			1
so , naturally , @entity20 worked it into his routine			0
while greeting @entity57 chief @entity56 , @entity20 asked , ' @entity56 , can i borrow your pocket knife ? ' manhunt : as @entity7 prism program leaker @entity63 is on the run , @entity20 is joking about the controversial program the former @entity7 employee blew the whistle on @entity20 's big mouth has landed him in hot water on several occasions over the course of his career			1
in 2003 , while attempting to explain the absence of weapons of mass destruction in @entity78 , @entity20 , then the head of the @entity75 , said the weapons were there , but they 'd been shipped out of the country to places like @entity83 just prior to the @entity18 invasion - a conclusion his own agency said it ' could not provide further evidence to support			2
' in 2010 , while serving as under - secretary of defense for intelligence , @entity20 let it slip to @entity91 that he had no clue that 12 would - be terrorists had been arrested in @entity94 earlier that day , despite the news having been broadcast across international news outlets like @entity97 and the @entity98			2
in february , 2011 , @entity20 appeared before a @entity100 intelligence committee while serving in his current post as director of national intelligence			0
during the hearing , @entity20 gave the @entity104 - a violent , @entity105 jihadist group - what pundits would later call a ' pr makeover			2
' ' the term " @entity104 " … is an umbrella term for a variety of movements , in the case of @entity113 , a very heterogeneous group , largely secular , which has eschewed violence and has decried @entity116 as a perversion of @entity105 … there is no overarching agenda , particularly in the pursuit of violence , ' @entity20 explained to the committee			0
is it something i said ? @entity20 's comments have landed him in hot water several times over the course of his career			0
those comments were later described by former @entity18 ambassador to the @entity133 @entity132 as ' perhaps the stupidest statement made by any administration in @entity18 international history			0
' in march 2011 , as the @entity18 was assisting rebels in their efforts to oust @entity140 dictator @entity139 , @entity20 - as the director of national intelligence - told the @entity142 that ' over the longer term , [ @entity139 ] will prevail			0
' even the @entity100 tried to distance itself from @entity20 's comments , with then - national security adviser @entity144 telling reporters @entity20 's gaffe was nothing more than a ' static and one - dimensional assessment			2
' during that same hearing , @entity20 neglected to include @entity150 and @entity151 on a list of nuclear powers that might pose a threat to the @entity18 - the general consensus , of course , is that the @entity18 ' two biggest nuclear threats are those very countries .			0
