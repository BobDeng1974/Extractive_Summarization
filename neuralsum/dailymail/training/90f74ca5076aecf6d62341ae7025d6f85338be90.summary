@entity0 are back in the midst of another defensive injury crisis amid fears that @entity4 could be out for six weeks with a dislocated shoulder			1
@entity4 was carried off on a stretcher during @entity0 ’s @entity8 defeat to @entity9 at the @entity10 on sunday and needed oxygen at one point			1
further rests have confirmed the defender ’s injury is a full dislocation and the recovery time could be six weeks or even longer			2
the exact timescale will depend on whether @entity4 has torn or merely stretched the ligaments that usually hold the shoulder in place			1
it was something of a surprise , therefore , to see the 24 - year - old play down the injury on @entity35 the day after the derby			2
@entity38 un mal momento / thank you all for your messages			0
thank god it was nothing , ' @entity4 wrote			1
@entity0 believe @entity4 , who speaks only limited @entity46 as he has only been in the country for just over two months , made something of a mistake in his translation of the @entity52 part of his tweet			1
' @entity55 mal momento ' translates as ' only a bad moment ' , rather than ' nothing ' , and the club believe the defender 's injury is serious			0
@entity4 was discharged from hospital on sunday evening and the club confirmed that the defender had suffered a dislocation			1
@entity4 ’s father appeared to confuse matters last night when he told a tv station in @entity68 : ‘ the injury is not too severe			1
he will miss two or three games			0
’ however , senior sources at @entity73 confirmed yesterday that the injury was a dislocation and it seems improbable the £ 16million signing could recover that quickly			0
this means @entity0 manager @entity22 will have to plan for the coming weeks of the campaign without the man he bought from @entity82 in the summer			1
with fellow central defenders @entity84 and @entity86 struggling with injuries ahead of saturday ’s @entity89 match with @entity90 , and right back @entity91 also on the sidelines , @entity83 is expected to ask midfielder @entity93 to fill in			1
@entity94 revealed last month that @entity93 had been told by @entity83 to prepare for defensive duties on his return from his own long - term injury troubles			2
the @entity99 international midfielder went straight into the centre of defence when he came on at @entity9 on sunday and is ready to do so again against @entity90			1
the news comes as a further blow to @entity22 ( right ) , who is struggling with defensive options @entity93 said : ‘ that position is not something i have played an awful lot			2
i have had spells of it , playing two or three or four games in a season			0
‘ but if i need to play there then fine			0
i have not had a lot of football recently so i will play anywhere , i do n’t mind			0
‘ ideally we just need to get players fit and have more options to choose from			0
’ @entity0 began the season with a host of injuries at the back , prompting @entity83 to hand debuts to @entity124 and @entity125			1
those problems were starting to ease but with @entity23 serving a one - game ban after a red card on sunday , the @entity0 boss is back to square one			1
@entity93 featured for the first time this season for @entity0 against @entity9 on monday night @entity93 could only hope things will turn @entity0 ’s way			1
‘ we look at the points total and we are bitterly disappointed with the amount we have got , ’ he said			0
‘ it is nowhere near good enough for where we want to be			0
but if you look deeper there are signs we are still going to have a good season			0
‘ overall the feeling is we are still building to be successful and i think we will be			0
points wise it might suggest we are not close to @entity145 and @entity9 but you look at the @entity145 game , i think we deserved the win			2
‘ @entity148 we also felt we deserved more , but that is the way it is going			0
we are experienced enough to know that points are what you are judged on			0
‘ it is up to us now to have a big push and put ourselves right back up there again			2
’ @entity156 defensive crisis for @entity83 like our @entity0 facebook page .			2
