coal mines in the @entity1 may have closed many years ago , but coal is still making a living for a few hardy men			0
@entity5 is one such ' sea - coaler ' - someone who makes their living by collecting and selling coal washed up on the beaches of @entity12 in @entity13			1
the 51 - year - old has to plan his work around the moon , because every low tide the waves at @entity19 beach in @entity12 bring ashore tons of coal washed up from seams in the bed of the @entity24			1
black gold : @entity5 , pictured , is a ' sea - colaer ' who spends all day scraping coal off of a beach in @entity12 , @entity13 fuel : mr @entity5 and the 18 other sea - coalers harvest thousands of tonnes of coal a year , which is burned for energy twice a day at the low tide mr @entity5 rakes the washed - up black coal deposits into small piles and them shovels them into his specially - adapted @entity41 pickup			1
it is backbreaking physical labour			0
the sodden coal particles are heavy and must be scraped up using only a rake and shovel			0
it is not known where the seams lie exactly , but the seabed is constantly eroded by the currents and every tide lifts its load and drags it to shore			0
collection : this back - breaking labour allows @entity56 hall and his colleagues to collect around a tonne of coal each every day transport : mr @entity61 uses an adapted @entity41 to transport the coal , but bollards erected by the local council mean he can no longer get it on the beach stoic : the work is incredibly arduous and the men must move quickly to harvest the coal dispute : some say the sea - coalers provide a valuable service , others claim they damage they are bad for the beach a seasoned sea - coaler , @entity5 has been scouring the sands for 30 years on and off , and on an average day he can get up to a tonne , which sells for about Â£ 10			1
he is one of a small group of men in @entity12 who scrape a living from the back - breaking work , which sees them heading for the shore at any given hour			1
on average , 10,000 to 15,000 tonnes a year will be collected from the beaches around @entity12 , before being transported to power stations			0
@entity87 : the seawater makes the coal particles very heavy , and the only way to lift the dust onto the @entity41 is by hand the coal is washed up from seams on the ocean floor			0
the amount varies day to day dispute : @entity98 says sea - coaling must stop as the beach is for pedestrians only but with much of the @entity103 's coal - fired power stations facing imminent retirement under the @entity106 's @entity105 , making a living from sea - coaling may soon become a footnote in the history of the @entity103 coal industry			2
the industry is not without its detractors			0
many residents claim it is dangerous and causes damage to the beaches , but some claim the sea - coalers provide a vital public service by keeping the beaches clean			2
in 2001 there were an estimated 20 sea - coalers operating in @entity12			1
in the seventh century , the monks of the nearby village of @entity126 burned the coal for warmth ancient : the coal was first gathered by monks in the 7th century uncertainty : coal - fired plants are under threat , throwing doubt onto the future of sea - coaling 's future veteran : mr @entity5 has been sea - coaling on and off since he was 21 , more than 30 years fuel : the coal is transported to power stations hard : the coal is swept into a series of small piles and then hauled onto the pick - up @entity41 scraping together : an average load on the @entity41 is two tonnes			2

images show the back - breaking work done by ' sea - coalers '
the men harvest coal washed up on the beach in @entity12
but the trade is under threat from @entity106 *regulation*
