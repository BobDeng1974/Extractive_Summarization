by @entity0 @entity1 : 09:45 est , 23 december 2013 @entity2 : 19:41 est , 24 december 2013 a beautiful time - lapse of the @entity4 dancing over the incredibly clear night skies of @entity6 in @entity7 has been created by an astronomy student			1
@entity9 from the @entity10 at @entity11 created the video from photographs taken on three consecutive nights in april and four nights over the summer			1
his video , which instantly went viral , shows the night sky progression over @entity6 , a 4,207 metre ( 13,803 - foot ) mountain on @entity7 's @entity19 , along with its many telescopes			1
pictured here is the @entity24 observatory the summit of @entity6 on the @entity19 hosts the world 's largest astronomical observatory , with telescopes operated by eleven countries			1
the combined light - gathering power of the telescopes on @entity6 is fifteen times greater than that of the @entity34 telescope in @entity35 -- for many years the world 's largest			1
it is also sixty times greater than that of the @entity39			0
the @entity24 , @entity41 and @entity42 telescopes within the complex all have lasers , which are used to remove the blurring effects of @entity47 's atmosphere			1

the telescopes in the area are operated by astronomers from eleven countries			0
their combined light - gathering power is fifteen times greater than that of the @entity34 telescope in @entity35			0
it is also sixty times greater than that of the @entity39			0
@entity6 is unique as an astronomical observing site			0
the atmosphere above the mountain is extremely dry -- which is important in measuring infrared and submillimeter radiation from celestial sources			0
the proportion of clear nights in the area is among the highest in the world			2
‘ just as waves of heat coming off pavement blur out the detail in faraway objects , winds in the atmosphere blur out fine detail in the stars , galaxies and whatever is being observed , ’ explained mr @entity9			2
‘ the laser is used to track this atmospheric turbulence , and one of the mirrors in the telescope bends hundreds of times per second in order to cancel out the blurring			0
’ mr @entity9 set up his cameras on nights when the weather was clear , the moon was small and when he knew the telescopes would be running the lasers			1
astronomers are currently using the lasers to observe the black hole at the centre of the @entity4			1
the proportion of clear nights in this region is among some of the highest in the world			2
@entity103 and rebel xt mr @entity9 took 300 one minute exposures , with an average scene taking about five hours to film			2
the @entity24 , @entity41 and @entity42 telescopes within the complex all have lasers , which are used to remove the blurring effects of @entity47 's atmosphere using a @entity102			1
@entity103 and rebel xt mr @entity9 took 300 one minute exposures , with an average scene taking about five hours to film mr @entity9 set up his cameras on nights when the weather was clear , the moon was small and when he knew the telescopes would be running the lasers the conditions meant that mr @entity9 often suffered from altitude sickness during filming			1
‘ i 've had my vision fade out , have lost my balance , and have needed to stop to catch my breath while hiking around at night , ’ he said			0
to create motion in the scenes , the student used a home - built rotary table and later edited the images to create the video			0
mr @entity9 has made several other time - lapse videos in the past , including of @entity131 and @entity132 in @entity35 - but this one has proved particuarly popular			2
' time lapse of the night skies is awesome			0
telescopes are awesome , too			0
throw in some 1 - ft - wide lasers , and then it 's even better , ' he said			2
the telescopes in the area are operated by astronomers from eleven countries			0
pictured is the @entity41 - an 8.1 - metre telescope operated by a consortium of seven countries their combined light - gathering power of is fifteen times greater than that of the @entity34 telescope in @entity35 conditions meant that mr @entity9 often suffered from altitude sickness during filming			2

@entity9 created the video from photographs taken over seven nights
video shows the telescopes and lasers at work at @entity168 in @entity7
@entity170 is world 's largest observatory located on a 4,207m mountain
observatory is currently looking at the black hole at centre of the @entity4
