eleven - year - old @entity0 took her bow at the @entity2 at @entity3 on thursday , resplendent in a stars - and - stripes outfit			1
and the @entity8 junior , the youngest to play in a @entity9 — men ’s or women ’s — could hardly have got off to a better start , bagging birdies at the first and fifth holes			1
sadly , @entity0 could not continue the fairytale and eventually slid to an eight - over - par 78 that left her some way off the first - round lead			1
meanwhile , @entity28 endured a torrid time with his wedge and putter at the @entity32 , recording a three - over par 74 that left him 10 shots behind first - round pacesetter @entity35 of @entity37			2
‘ i was very sloppy with the scoring clubs today , ’ admitted @entity28 , who revealed he had received a ‘ great reaction ’ to his decision to play for @entity40 at the @entity41 in @entity42			0
‘ i drove the ball beautifully again , putting myself in great positions , but i was not able to capitalise			0
hopefully i ’ll do a better job tomorrow			0
’ rough patch : she was seven over-par after 16 holes , caught with a tricky shot on the 11th hole @entity52 shot : @entity0 plays from the sand on the 10th during a tricky opening round for the amateur			0

@entity0 finishes eight - over par after first round at @entity3
11 - year - old is youngest ever qualifier at women *'s* @entity9
