speeding scam : @entity1 , 27 , feared six points would ruin her chances of driving the school minibus so she came up with the scam a schoolmistress tried to change the appearance of her car to dodge six speeding points because she was worried they might end her participation in the school 's @entity12			1
geography teacher @entity1 , 27 , was not even facing a driving ban after being caught speeding twice in ten minutes in a 30mph zone			1
but she feared the points would ruin her chances of driving her pupils in a school minibus to an event in @entity20 organised by the @entity22 youth charity			2
so she dreamt up a scam in which she added @entity25 stickers to her @entity26 , fitted a rectangular tax disc holder and added a tow bar holder before claiming it was a different car that had been caught speeding			1
@entity1 , who was in charge of @entity33 pupils at @entity35 sports college in @entity36 , @entity37 , sent in photographs of her newly modified car which showed a @entity25 sticker in the rear windscreen and further stickers on the bumper			1
she urged officials to match it against the vehicle their camera snapped twice in ten minutes travelling at 41mph and the other at 43mph			1
she hoped her scheme would convince officials that they had instead caught a cloned car speeding			1
but the @entity53 was immediately suspicious and @entity1 , who is currently 28 weeks pregnant , was arrested			1
she was later hauled before @entity54 where she pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice			0
she was sentenced to six months in prison , suspended for 12 months after a judge said the scam was ' foolish and foolhardy			0
' she was also ordered to carry out 80 hours unpaid work and pay Â£ 500 costs			0
despite the conviction she is expected to keep her job			2
flood 's fall from grace began in june last year after headteachers at @entity35 where has worked for six years gave her responsibility to organise pupils for @entity69 and other outdoor education			2
at 10.22am on 1 june 2012 her l - registered @entity26 was snapped driving at 43mph on @entity71 , @entity72 , and minutes later at 10.32am the same vehicle was recorded travelling at 41mph in the opposite direction			2
two speeding tickets were sent to flood but the following month she called the @entity76 saying it was not her car as she would have been in school at the time and asked for photographic evidence			1
in august she sent back the two notices along with a letter and three images she herself took of her vehicle along with a copy of a ' signing in and out sheet ' from her workplace			0
in the letter , @entity1 said that it could not have been her vehicle due to her being at work at the time of the offences			1
caught : flood is clocked doing 43mph in a 30 zone in @entity36 , @entity37 in june 2012 again : ten minutes later she is clocked breaking the limit agin , this time driving in the opposite direction down the same road she wrote : ' there are features of the car which are not present on the photographic evidence i received			1
my car has had a smaller , silver tax disc holder for around a year			2
i have a @entity25 sticker in the rear windscreen			0
my car also has no tow bar cover			2
' but a search on computer systems for vehicles of the same registration returned several images from 2 , 6 , 7 and 29 june 2012 which showed the @entity116 was the same as the vehicle caught speeding - except without the stickers tow bar , rectangular tax disc holder			1
officers suspected the car 's appearance had been deliberately changed and arrested @entity1 in december last year			1
modifications : @entity1 put a different sort of tax disc ( centre ) and a @entity25 sticker on her car ( bottom ) in an effort to convince the @entity53 they had caught a cloned car speeding			1
she also made modifications to the front of the car ( top )			2
these pictures are from the @entity140 dossier of evidence in mitigation defence lawyer mr @entity142 , said : ' the only reason mrs @entity1 tried to avoid prosecution was because she knew she needed a clean driving licence to drive the school minibus that takes the pupils to @entity33 locations - an activity which is entirely voluntary			1
' mrs @entity1 changed the appearance of her car to avoid getting points on her licence , and she was wrong to do that			1
' she did not realise the seriousness of what she did until she was arrested			2
in those six months since her husband @entity157 has described her as having " daily tears "			0
' she has become depressed , so depressed that she has considered taking her own life and has been prescribed antidepressants			0
scam : @entity1 was arrested at school and later charged with perverting the course of justice			1
she pleaded guilty but avoided a jail term ' the head teacher of her school has given a character reference , in which he has stated that mrs @entity1 may keep her job if she does not go to prison			1
if she goes to prison she will be dismissed and not be able to continue her career			0
' mrs @entity1 's mother is currently ill with cancer			1
mrs @entity1 is her mother 's rock '			2
passing sentence judge @entity178 told @entity1 : ' let me make this clear : this is an exceptional case and you have only avoided custody because of the exceptional circumstances			2
impeccable character alone is not enough and this an individual case			0
' these types of offences strike at the heart of the whole system , which relies on the honesty of drivers			0
prison sentences invariably follow for this type of offence			0
' you are an exceptionally talented teacher			2
you have worked at @entity198 school for six years			0
you earn a good salary			0
' the reason why you tried to avoid the charges speaks for itself - you wanted to continue to be able to take pupils to and from @entity204 locations			0
this foolhardy offence was not for foolish reasons			0
you did this to avoid embarrassment at school			0
' you have shown great remorse since your arrest and you have learned a lesson			0
speeding fine : @entity214 's car , parked outside her home in @entity217 , which she tried to ' modify ' so she would be let off the hook for two speeding offences ' unlike others who try to get pregnant after their arrest to avoid custody , you were pregnant at the time of the arrest , and your baby is due in august			1
' taking this into account along with the fact that your mother is suffering with acute myeloid leukaemia , you will have your baby in an ordinary way			0
you will be able to undertake some light community work in the two months before your baby is born			0
after the case @entity233 @entity234 , from @entity37 said : ' @entity1 has gone to some quite extraordinary lengths to try and avoid speeding fines			1
' this case proves that the consequences of not facing up to motoring offences can be significantly magnified when you try and lie yourself out of trouble			0
' while it ties up resources , we will not hesitate to investigate and prosecute where we believe serious offences have been committed and i want to highlight this case to send out a stark warning to other motorists			0

@entity1 , 27 , was caught speeding twice down the same road in the space of 10 minutes
she tried to convince the @entity53 they had photographed a cloned car
but officials became suspicious and the pregnant teacher was arrested
flood is *spared* jail and is likely to keep her job
