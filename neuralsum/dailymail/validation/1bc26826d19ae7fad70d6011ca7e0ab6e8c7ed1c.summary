a host of @entity8 's rising track stars , who make up the majority of a largely inexperienced team , carry medal hopes into the event , which gets under way at @entity16 's @entity15 on friday			1
@entity8 's 60 metres challenge is spearheaded by 21 - year - old @entity18 on the men 's side and 19 - year - old @entity21 on the women 's , while the likes of @entity24 , 20 , goes into her first major championships as @entity27 number one over 400m			1

thirty - one of the 37 strong team are 25 or under and , in the absence of big names like @entity39 , @entity40 or @entity41 , @entity0 is keen to see them handle the weight of expectation			1
' we want to see people who cope with the circumstances , apply themselves well , perform well and out of that come medals , great performances , finalists and personal bests , ' he said			0
' we are really optimistic we can perform well			0
@entity52 , @entity53 , @entity0 and @entity18 at a @entity16 2015 press conference ' for those for whom this is a critical competition to get the experience to demonstrate their progression , it 's the biggest thing they 've ever done			1
' there 's a real buzz within the team			2
it 's great to have that combination of young people joining and feeling really good about it			2
' @entity70 hurdler and team captain @entity53 , who finished fourth at @entity71 and one the most experienced members of the squad at 24 , backed his young compatriots to thrive on the big stage			2
team captain @entity53 has backed his young compatriots to thrive on the big stage in @entity16 ' these guys here are putting pressure on everyone else around them , , ' the @entity78 said			1

' @entity8 won 23 medals , including 12 golds , at last summer 's @entity94 outdoors , their best ever return			2
@entity0 admitted it was important to keep the momentum going , with the @entity97 in @entity98 coming up this summer and the @entity99 the following year			2
but he refused to be drawn on whether his team could eclipse their best haul from a @entity102 , 10 medals and four golds from @entity105 in 2007			0
@entity53 and @entity0 attend @entity8 & @entity107 press conference ahead of the 2015 championships ' it would be pretty weird if we were n't here seriously competing with a view to doing well , ' he said			1
' we expect to perform well and i think it is important because we all thrive on doing well			0
we all enjoy it , feel more confident and generally seem to perform better from doing well , so i think it 's important to keep that going			0
' but i am not relating it to the past			0
