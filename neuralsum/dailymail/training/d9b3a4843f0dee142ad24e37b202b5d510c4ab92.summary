by @entity0 @entity1 is the millionaire lawyer known as mr loophole thanks to his astonishing ability to get celebrities off driving offences with the most extraordinary explanations or technicalities			1
but last week he suffered a rare defeat when representing @entity10 star @entity9 , who was accused of using a mobile phone while driving and failing to stop for police			1
@entity1 told @entity13 that depriving @entity9 of her licence would be unfair since she was too famous to take the bus			1
but district judge @entity16 was having none of it , saying : ‘ pay someone to drive you			1
’ @entity1 ( left ) is the lawyer known as mr loophole thanks to his ability to get celebrities off driving offences with the most extraordinary explanations or technicalities			1
the lawyer suffered a rare defeat when representing @entity10 star @entity9 ( right ) other judges , however , have been convinced by the merits of @entity1 ’s pleas on behalf of his clients , however outlandish			1
here , @entity0 presents some of his most high - profile clients and cases , but can you spot which was the real argument @entity1 used , and which are our inventions ? @entity38 the case : in 2009 , the comedian — who has been represented by @entity1 in three separate driving charges — was alleged to have used a mobile phone while driving his @entity43 through @entity44 , @entity45			1
so what had @entity1 argued ? ( a ) @entity38 ’s accountant had just rung , warning him that if he did n’t find a way of shifting his tour receipts out of the country he might actually have to pay some tax			1
he felt obliged to take the call			2
( b ) @entity38 was only pretending to make a telephone call to stop fans coming up to him at red lights and trying to talk to him			2
( c ) @entity38 was not making a telephone call			2
he was actually using his iphone to dictate an idea for a joke and dictating into a phone is not illegal			2
comedian @entity38 ( right ) and lawyer @entity1 leave @entity62 , @entity63 , in march 2009 @entity64 the case : another three - time client of @entity1 ’s , the heavyweight golfer escaped a possible 56 - day ban in june 2010 , having been fined £ 60 for driving his £ 115,000 @entity69 at 70mph in a 40mph zone of the @entity71 in @entity72 , then failing to pay the penalty on time			1
how did @entity1 persuade the court to let @entity76 keep driving ? ( a ) @entity76 has a medical condition that requires him to eat twice as often as other people and so has to travel by car because the buffet trolleys are apt to run out on trains			1
( b ) @entity76 is scared of flying and is thus obliged to drive from his home in @entity84 to @entity85 just to see his and ex-wife @entity87 ’s three children			2
( c ) @entity76 can not fly because he ’s always harassed in the departure lounge by sports fans asking him why he ’s never won a single golf major			2
golfer @entity64 ( right ) arrives with solicitor mr @entity1 ( left ) at the @entity92 accused of speeding @entity93 the case : in 2007 , @entity1 successfully defended snooker star @entity93 , who was accused of failing to provide police with a urine sample when suspected of drink driving			1
in a bizarre , twice - heard case , which of these arguments did @entity1 not employ : ( a ) the trial should be stopped because the magistrate was winking at a journalist , to which the magistrate replied : ‘ do you think i ’m gay or something ? ’ ( b ) police had not followed proper procedure because one of the arresting officers asked @entity93 for an autograph			1
( c ) @entity93 could not provide a sample because his well - known depressive disorder meant that he was too stressed to pee			2
@entity114 was given an eight - month ban in 1999 but @entity1 successfully appealed the verdict @entity114 the case : in 1999 , @entity114 was given an eight - month ban , having been caught driving his £ 150,000 @entity118 at 76mph in a 50mph zone in @entity120 , @entity121			1
@entity1 successfully appealed the verdict			1
the reason : ( a ) @entity114 was suffering severe emotional trauma , having recently been hit by a football boot kicked by sir @entity126 and thus had no idea of his speed			2
( b ) @entity114 was ‘ petrified ’ having been chased for ten miles from his @entity130 home by a paparazzo			2
( c ) he was hurrying home because his wife @entity133 had a @entity135 concert in @entity136 and he was on babysitting duties with his newborn son @entity138			2
sir @entity126 the case : in 1999 , @entity114 ’s then - manager also had cause to be grateful for @entity1 ’s services , having been caught avoiding a motorway traffic jam by driving down the hard shoulder			1
@entity1 successfully argued that @entity126 had a good reason for doing so , to wit : ( a ) he was desperately trying to catch up with the @entity147 team coach , which had accidentally left without him , en route to a vital @entity150 fixture			1
( b ) he had a stomach upset , feared he was about to be caught short and was frantically trying to get to the toilet at @entity147 ’s training ground			2
( c ) he ’d been chased by a car sporting @entity156 flags and driven by fans making obscene gestures , and , as an elderly man driving on his own , feared for his personal safety			0
@entity161 ( pictured earlier this week ) was represented by mr @entity1 in 2006 @entity161 the case : in october 2006 , an @entity162 that had been loaned to the @entity164 presenter was snapped doing 82mph in a 50mph zone in @entity167 , @entity45			1
@entity1 had the case dropped within a matter of minutes			1
what was his winning argument ? ( a ) @entity162 , to whom the ticket was issued , passed it on to @entity161 because he had been loaned the car			0
but all @entity162 knew was that @entity161 had borrowed the car — they had no proof he ’d been driving it			0
( b ) the driver could have been any one of the @entity164 team			0
and if it had been @entity181 he would have been too small to be spotted by a speed camera , anyway			0
( c ) it was a matter of deep personal principle			0
@entity161 had just overtaken a bus because he believes that : ‘ poor people just do n’t need to get anywhere quicker than i do			0
’ @entity188 the case : the @entity190 cricketer was alleged to have been driving at 87mph in a temporary 50mph zone on the @entity192			0
yet the case against him at @entity195 collapsed in less than a minute			0
did @entity1 say that : ( a ) as a test cricketer , @entity188 had such pin - sharp eyesight and fast reflexes that there was no danger in driving at speeds that might be hazardous for average men and women with normal reaction times			1
( b ) @entity188 regularly bowled at 87mph so he simply did not perceive that speed as being particularly fast , and was thus unaware that he was breaking the limit			0
( c ) the authorities were simply too slow and the prosecution notice was received by @entity188 16 days after the alleged offence , when the law says it has to be issued in 14 days			0
@entity190 cricketer @entity188 leaves @entity213 after he was acquitted of speeding @entity215 the case : in 2010 , @entity190 footballer @entity215 escaped an automatic six - month ban despite being caught driving at 105mph on the @entity71 in @entity85			0
@entity1 had the punishment cut to a £ 750 fine and a 50 - day ban , which was immediately suspended when @entity1 said that he would appeal the verdict			1
so did he argue that : ( a ) @entity215 had to be able to drive , since his wife @entity221 had been traumatised by a recent carjacking , could no longer drive herself and was , yes , too famous to use public transport			0
( b ) @entity215 was unaware of the speed he was doing because @entity221 had gone into hysterics after breaking a heel on her £ 1,000 louboutins and he was on a mercy dash to the cobblers			0
( c ) injury - prone @entity215 had just been passed fit by a top @entity231 doctor and he was rushing to tell his manager the good news before he crocked himself again			0
footballer @entity215 's wife @entity221 @entity236 the case : in october 2011 , the @entity238 singer was clocked doing 105mph in his luxury @entity240 on the @entity241			0
he was fined £ 650 and given six penalty points , but escaped a ban thanks to @entity1 ’s explanation that @entity236 needed his car because : ( a ) it was the only way of getting to the top - secret location where the @entity238 were rehearsing for a series of comeback concerts			1
( b ) @entity236 ’s unfair reputation for riotous , rock star behaviour meant that he was already banned from virtually all forms of public transport and air travel			0
( c ) @entity236 hated taking public transport because fans of other bands constantly made fun of the fact that he has a more than passing resemblance to a monkey			0
and one that got away			0
@entity262 the case : in august 2006 , former supermodel caprice was given a 12 - month ban for drink - driving , despite @entity1 ’s attempt to convince the court that she had not really been consuming alcohol			1
did he claim : ( a ) @entity262 had been intoxicated by painkillers used to ease the agonising complications caused by recent surgery			0
( b ) @entity262 had been dazed by anti-depressants taken to ease the emotional pain caused by cruel , untrue rumours that her looks were the result of extensive plastic surgery			0
( c ) @entity262 had been taking drugs for a urinary tract infection that had given her ‘ alcohol halitosis ’ , creating a false impression that she had been drinking			0
@entity282 : @entity38 ( c ) ; @entity64 ( b ) ; @entity93 ( b ) ; @entity114 ( b ) ; sir @entity126 ( b ) ; @entity161 ( a ) ; @entity188 ( c ) ; @entity215 ( a ) ; @entity236 ( a ) ; @entity262 ( c )			0
