@entity0 has not wasted a chance since he was sacked a year ago to press his claims for an @entity4 recall , but surely national selector @entity5 has slammed the door in his face			1
responding to the latest whispers , he said : ‘ there is no way @entity0 will ever get back into an @entity4 team			0
he ’s no longer part of @entity4 cricket			0
’ @entity0 top scored with a ruthless 66 from only 46 balls in his first appearance in @entity18 's @entity17 for @entity19 this week			2
@entity0 scored 66 off 46 balls for @entity19 in the @entity17 in @entity18 but it does not seem that he will be returning to the @entity4 side soon , despite the @entity22 approaching that , coinciding with his friend @entity23 replacing @entity24 as one - day captain , seemed to boost his prospects of an international return with the @entity22 on the horizon			1
the 34 - year - old even entertained the idea on his @entity33 page , saying his ' phone is on ' and upon the news that @entity23 was made captain , tweeted ' i hope i get to play for him			0
' but judging by the reaction of @entity5 , it appears both @entity24 and @entity0 will be free during the tournament in @entity18 and @entity41 , which starts in february .			2

@entity0 hit 66 off 46 balls this week for @entity19
@entity24 was replaced by @entity23 as @entity4 's one - day captain
but national selector @entity5 has said @entity0 will not be used
