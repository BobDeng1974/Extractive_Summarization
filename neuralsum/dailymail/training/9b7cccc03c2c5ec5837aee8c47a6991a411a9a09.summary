@entity0 hit a sensational unbeaten 162 off just 66 balls as @entity2 inflicted the joint - heaviest ever @entity4 loss on the @entity5 , defeating them by 257 runs			1
the 31 - year - old smashed 17 fours and eight sixes , and plundered 68 runs from the last 3.2 overs , as @entity2 made 408 - the second - highest score in a @entity4			1
the @entity5 response never came to fruition as they were bowled out for a paltry 151 , despite an impressive half - century from captain @entity16 , with @entity17 claiming his maiden one - day five - for			1
.1111212114114411116442.2.444114411226.4114624442641266266 @entity22 , the no 1 ranked @entity21 batsman in the world , provided a stunning show of skill , power , precision and ingenuity			1
he reached his century off 52 balls as he smashed a six back over @entity16 ’s head			2
only @entity42 ( 50 balls against @entity44 in 2011 ) has scored a quicker @entity4 hundred			1
the @entity46 captain then hit the fastest 150 in a @entity4 , off 64 balls , and celebrated reaching the landmark by finishing off the innings with back - to - back sixes			1
@entity2 ’s decision to bat first had seemed a poor one initially as they struggled to free the shackles of the opening bowling pair of @entity57 and @entity16			1
the latter dismissed the horribly out - of - form @entity59 for just 12 who , looking to release the building pressure , went after a short ball and could only pick out @entity63 at point			0
@entity22 carries a look of focus as he plays a shot on his way to 162 runs from 66 balls for @entity2 @entity22 is congratulated by his team - mate @entity71 - who himself scored 10 runs not out as @entity2 leave the field after their batting innings , @entity22 ( right ) is congratulated by @entity76 413 - 5 - @entity77 vs. @entity78 , 2007 408 - 5 - @entity2 vs. @entity28 , 2015 398 - 5 - @entity79 vs. @entity80 , 1996 377 - 6 - australia vs. @entity81 , 2007 373 - 6 - @entity77 vs. @entity82 , 1999 372 - 2 - @entity5 vs. @entity83 , 2015 370 - 4 - @entity77 vs. @entity85 @entity84 , 2011 it brought @entity87 to the crease and his century stand with @entity90 , who seemed intent on ensuring he batted throughout , helped rebuild their side 's innings			1
@entity76 , fresh from his record - breaking 215 against @entity83 , first had @entity93 caught behind for 62 , before @entity90 was trapped plumb in front for 65 two balls later			2
that was perhaps the worst thing that could have happened , as the destructive @entity22 strode out on to the @entity99 pitch in the 30th over			2
just six boundaries had been hit at that point , five fours and a six , but after 96 runs were thumped off the final five overs , the boundary count stood at 30 fours and 11 sixes			0
@entity16 took the brunt of the attack as he conceded 75 runs off his last three overs , having previously had respectable figures of 1 - 29 from seven			2
@entity113 celebrates his 50 ; he went on to score 61 , surprisingly only the fourth highest total @entity5 batsman @entity115 endured a torrid time at the crease , and was dismissed for a duck @entity113 made an impressive 61 as he shared a 134 - run fourth wicket partnership with @entity22 , while @entity120 made a quick - fire 20 and @entity121 an unbeaten 10 as @entity2 set a mammoth target of 409			1
in order to come anywhere close to the target , @entity76 , the @entity5 ’ enigmatic talisman , was going to need replicate his innings against @entity83			0
but with his last century against @entity2 in one - day cricket coming in november 2006 , the omens were not good			2
@entity129 , brought in for the injured @entity130 , immediately repaid the faith shown in him as he bowled @entity76 for just three in his first over before having @entity115 caught behind for a duck			0
@entity133 ( third right ) celebrates with his team - mates after taking the wicket of @entity137 @entity17 ( centre ) celebrates after @entity5 batsman @entity139 is stumped by @entity59 it should have gone from bad to worse as @entity141 was twice dropped , first by @entity142 off his own bowling and then by @entity17 at mid-on off @entity129			2
it was the kind of luck the @entity5 desperately needed but the slightly controversial dismissal of @entity148 showed that luck was certainly not on their side under the @entity99 floodlights			0
@entity154 looked to have overstepped his mark by about six inches the ball before @entity148 picked out the effervescent @entity22 at mid-on , a ball he was convinced should have been a free hit			0
and @entity141 ’s luck came to an end the very next ball as he holed out to a superb overhead catch from @entity120 at long - on off @entity17 for 31			0
@entity129 ( left ) jumps for joy after taking the wicket of @entity115 , leaving @entity5 16 - 2 @entity76 ( left ) looks dejected , while @entity148 ( right ) reacts more violently with his bat it induced another collapse that is becoming the mark of a side that continues to blow hot and cold , as @entity17 , the leg spinner with roots in @entity171 , removed @entity137 and @entity63 for ducks and @entity139 for just five , reducing the @entity5 to 63 - 7			1
@entity17 claimed his all - important fifth wicket as @entity174 was bowled for 22 by a flighted googly that evaded his defence			0
@entity16 refused to be so easily dismissed , despite suffering from what looked like a hip injury and severe cramp that hindered his running			0
the 23 - year - old made 56 before sending a @entity142 delivery high into the night sky to be caught by @entity90			0
@entity184 managed to pull @entity142 for a single off his last delivery before being caught in the slips by @entity90 off @entity154			0
that run ensured the @entity5 avoided the heaviest defeat in a @entity4 match , a record they now share with @entity192			1
@entity90 takes a catch to dismiss @entity5 batsman @entity16 during the @entity195 match in @entity28 @entity129 ( second right ) consoles @entity16 after the @entity46 team had wrapped up a convincing win			0

@entity2 won the toss and decided to bat first , going on to record an impressive total of 408 - 5 against @entity5
their total was the second - highest in @entity4 history , and @entity0 scored the fastest ever odi 150 in his world - class knock
@entity22 eventually reached 162 from 66 balls , before @entity5 batted
@entity5 reached a total of 151 , losing by 257 runs to @entity2
