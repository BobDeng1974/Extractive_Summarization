but , thanks to @entity6 inventor @entity5 , a keyboard , a bicycle wheel and a telephone can now be turned into flying unmanned vehicles - along with just about any other everyday item			1
his ' drone it yourself ' kit can make more or less anything take flight			2
once the clamps and propellers are attached and the wires are connected , the machine is created			1
it is not for sale yet , but the creator has has made the printer files available , so anyone can make them			2
the brains of the system run on an @entity43 flight controller , making the entire kit , from soup to nuts , completely open source and therefore free			0
there ’s also no soldering or heavy machinery involved in creating the components for the kit — so it requires no technical know - how to execute			0
the kit itself simply clamps on to any object with a simple vice mechanism			0
while @entity72 does n’t give any weight stipulations , it is safe to say if the drone can not achieve liftoff , a lighter object is needed			0
his kit comes with plastic parts , wires and motors and , once connected , the drone is created while @entity72 does n't give any weight stipulations , it is safe to say if your drone can not achieve liftoff , you are going to need to find a lighter object drones are deployed predominantly for military and special operation applications , but are also used in a small but growing number of civil applications , such as policing and firefighting			1
earlier this week the @entity94 successfully landed a drone the size of a fighter jet aboard an aircraft carrier for the first time , showing the military 's capability to have a computer program perform one of the most difficult tasks a pilot is asked to do			1
the motors used for the project , which has seen interest from around the world @entity110 shows off his propellers , which he has attached to all manner of everyday objects the kit needed to to create your very own household drones the landing of the @entity120 experimental aircraft means the @entity94 can move forward with its plans to develop another unmanned aircraft that will join the fleet alongside traditional airplanes to provide around - the - clock surveillance while also possessing a strike capability			0
it also would pave the way for the @entity129 to launch unmanned aircraft without the need to obtain permission from other countries to use their bases .			0

@entity5 has created computer programme available *online*
