it has long been a much - loved staple of the @entity2 breakfast			1
but bacon has been given a healthy makeover – and for many , the results are … well , a little fishy			1
@entity7 bacon , which has proved a hit in @entity9 , @entity10 and the home of traditional bacon , @entity13 , is set to be launched in @entity2 supermarkets and restaurants			1
@entity29 claims it ‘ eats and tastes better than traditional smoked bacon ’			2
however , a survey by @entity33 revealed some shoppers will be loath to give up their bacon sandwiches any time soon			2
none of the 12 who took part in a ‘ blind ’ test thought the rashers were real bacon			2
a 6oz ( 170g ) pack with six rashers will cost £ 3 , making it the same price as supermarkets ’ own brands , such as @entity49 ’s @entity48 7.7oz ( 220g ) pack of six @entity52 rashers , which costs £ 3.30			0
however , the salmon contains 192 calories per 100g compared with 275 in the pork bacon			1
none of the 12 people who took part in a survey said they would swap their bacon sandwich for the salmon alternative sous chef @entity62 , 34 , from @entity63 , @entity64 , said : ‘ you can taste the smoky flavour			1
it ’s similar to bacon and there ’s no fat , so it will catch on			2
’ however , @entity71 , a retired teacher from @entity72 , @entity64 , was scathing : ‘ it looks horrible and tastes like anchovies			0
i ’d never buy it			0
’ others liked it – but said it could never replace real bacon			0
@entity80 , 24 , from @entity81 , @entity83 - @entity82 , added : ‘ i ’d eat salmon bacon , but for breakfast it must be real bacon			1
’ the @entity33 ’s food critic @entity86 delivered a withering verdict : ‘ the raw product is n’t bad			0
' slightly above average smoked salmon , cut to look like a rasher – if bacon slices suddenly turned a light orange and smelled of fish			1
‘ but the moment i threw it into a pan , it tensed and dried up , and started to resemble overcooked farmed salmon			0
it ’s bland and dreary , and miles removed from bacon			0
why bother going to all this trouble to sell smoked salmon as something that it ’s not ? ’ @entity106 , of @entity107 , said : ‘ it crisps like bacon , is as versatile , and makes a great breakfast bun with brown sauce			1
we ’re convinced it is going to be a healthy lifestyle option – it ’s high in omega 3 fatty acids that are good for the heart			0

unconventional food is popular in @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity13
@entity7 bacon rasher contains 192 calories compared to 275 in pork
