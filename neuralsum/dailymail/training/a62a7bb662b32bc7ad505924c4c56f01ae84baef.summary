students as young as thirteen are interviewing prospective teachers for jobs in schools			1
while @entity7 schools have been praising the unusual hiring process , the @entity5 believes it is n't an appropriate place for the student voice to be heard and the responsibility of the employment of staff should be left to the principal			1
@entity15 , principal of @entity16 , has been running with the alternative hiring system for the past four years			1
he told @entity18 that he thinks the process is ' fantastic ' and up to 70 percent of the staff at the school have been employed using the unusual hiring method			1
@entity15 ( pictured centre ) , principal of @entity16 , has been running with the alternative system of letting students help with the hiring of staff for the past four years ' not only do they interview teaching staff but they also interview support staff and even assistant principals , ' mr @entity15 said			1
the students range in ages and mr @entity15 said in the past there have been year 7 students involved in the selection process			1
' the students take it very very seriously			0
there have been very few occasions where we have n’t agreed as a panel , ' he said			0
' to be honest if somebody was n't prepared to be interviewed by students then they would n't be a good fit for us anyway			0
they would n't have the right attitude if that was going to be too confrontational for them			0
' speaking to @entity53 @entity7 branch president @entity52 said she strongly does not believe students should decide who is employed at @entity7 schools			1
' we do n’t support students being involved in the formal selection process of hiring staff , ' ms @entity52 said			1
it has been revealed that students as young a thirteen are involved in an interview process for prospective staff of @entity7 schools @entity16 in @entity7 has been running with the unusual hiring method for the past four years ' student ’s have an important voice in our schools and they 've got a lot to contribute but there are clear procedures that schools have to follow around staff employment and we do n’t believe that students actually being on selection panels making decisions about the appointment of staff is appropriate			1
' ms @entity52 said that the students may have the best intentions but they do not possess the skills or expertise necessary to able to make such a judgement			0
' students through no fault of their own have n't developed the skills and knowledge needed			0
the selection process is pretty rigorous and it requires people with an understanding of how that works , ' she said			0
' teachers do have to have good rapport and relationships with students but that ’s something that ’s tested in the selection procedures and application interview and the referees			2
' principal @entity15 said the prospective employee is firstly taken into a room with three adults members of the panel			2
the person is interviewed and then sent into another room to face a selection of students			0
the panel of students is chaired by a senior student , who has had experience in interviewing			0
he said the interviewees are told before they arrive that they will be questioned by students at the school during their interview			2
the school has trained nearly 50 students to be interviewers			0
firstly the students explore exactly what qualities they would like in a teacher			2
then they divide up into small groups and work out some appropriate questions that will give them an estimation as to how suitable the applicant will be for the job			0
the students ' interview with the prospective employee usually last about 15 minutes			1
@entity137 ( left ) and @entity138 ( right ) spoke to @entity18 about their involvement in the interview process the students are allowed to ask the interviewee a range of questions and their time with the person ususally lasts about 15 minutes ' i never fail to be impressed by their honesty , ' mr @entity15 said			1
' some of the comments that i 've heard expressed today by members of the public ( about the hiring method ) just shatter me at the lack of faith that they have in students			2
' i think when you treat students respectfully and get them to be involved in their own education they actually move up to that standard not lower their standard			2
' @entity137 from the @entity164 sits on a selection panel that is part of the hiring process at @entity16			1
she believes the process helps to build a strong student - teacher relationship as makes it easier for students to develop a connection with the new member of staff			1
she said a normal interview technique would be to ask the interviewee a scenario question			0
an example of one would be to ask how that person would react to a student acting out in a class affecting the environment for other students ' asking questions like that we ’d receive a more open - ended and extended answer , which gives you a better insight into how that individual would teach , ' ms @entity137 said			2
' it ’s a great example of student voice and the fact that we ’re actually heard on issues that do actually matter to our education			0
' @entity5 @entity7 branch president @entity52 said she strongly does not believe students should decide who is employed at @entity7 schools the 17 - year - old who is in year 12 at the school said she ca n't understand why people would think students should not be involved in the hiring process			1
' we are just as capable as a teacher is to interview a fellow teacher			2
we have all the experience of being in a classroom and observing what it ’s like to teach and what ’s it like to be taught , so why would n't we be on the panel that decides who will be our teacher , ' she said			0
' we want to get the most out of our education and that means we want someone who is qualified , someone who is capable and someone who is approachable			0
' 13 - year - old @entity138 , who is also on the selection panel at @entity16 , believes that students gain more respect for their teachers after becoming involved in selecting them for employment			1
' the best thing is to get a balance between respect , kindness and knowledge			0
i think if you can balance that out you ’re going to get really good teachers , ' he said			0
both @entity137 and @entity138 agree that the top traits they look for in a prospective teacher are for them to be ; approachable , knowledgeable , kindness and respect			1
an @entity242 of @entity244 spokesperson told @entity18 that the practice of involving students in employment processes does not exist in public schools in the state .			2

students in @entity7 are getting involved in the hiring of their teachers
the @entity5 is opposed to the method
@entity16 has been using the practice for four years
the principal believes it is ' fantastic ' and gives students a voice
@entity138 and @entity137 are involved in the process
they say it allows for a *mutual* respect between the students and teacher
the students interview the prospective teacher for 15 minutes
