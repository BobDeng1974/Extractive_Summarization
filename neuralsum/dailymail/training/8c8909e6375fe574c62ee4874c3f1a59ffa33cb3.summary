dr @entity62 , @entity63 said : ' children start to assert their independence and individuality from a very young age			2
' with toddlers it is often tantrums and saying no , but as children grow older they 're more comfortable expressing their personality			0
' one of the ways in which they can do this is by choosing how to decorate their own personal space , their bedroom			0
' being able to choose among different furnishing styles , gives a child the feeling of independence and self - confidence that comes from making an important decision			1
' @entity83 - @entity22 , @entity84 's mother , said : ' it 's fantastic to see a retailer such as @entity1 involving children in product decisions			1
' over the last few years @entity22 has developed her own taste and interests , for example , she particularly likes owls , so is naturally drawn to products that include them			0
' i believe it 's important as a parent to listen to your child 's opinion and let them express their creativity when decorating their own private space			1
' @entity22 thinks in her own way , and i try to nurture this			0
i encourage her choices as this is how she expresses her personality and what makes her special			0

' a @entity1 spokesperson said : ' children very much like to be involved in the design process of their rooms , and are naturally very creative			0
this year we decided to work with a small group of children to find out exactly what they want for their bedrooms			1
with the help from our ' @entity7 ' , we will aim to make buying children 's homewares easier for parents and more fun for the kids themselves			1
' the ongoing partnership will see children being being consulted for their input on new ranges and products			0
