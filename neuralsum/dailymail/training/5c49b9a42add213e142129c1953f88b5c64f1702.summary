the mayor of a small town in @entity2 is facing calls to quit after he moved 4,000 miles away to @entity4			1
@entity5 landed a new job just a month after he was chosen as mayor of @entity8 last may - a post for which he receives a £ 400 - a - year allowance			1
since then he has been returning for one week a month and conducting his civil duties over the phone , attending just 15 out of 41 events and sending his deputy to the rest			1
spinning plates : @entity5 is still serving as the mayor of @entity8 , a town in @entity2 , despite taking a new job 4,000 miles away in @entity4			1
he insisted he returns for one week every month the @entity20 mayor moved to the oil - rich @entity23 state 's capital @entity25 with @entity26 , a welfare - to - work firm with which he was an operations manager in the @entity28 for five years			1
since then his deputy @entity29 has been standing in at cheque presentations and school visits , as well as chairing council meetings in the town of 17,000 people			1
mr @entity5 , 57 , said he was planning to move back to @entity35 later this month			1
he told the @entity36 he received ' daily e-mails ' from the council 's clerk with agendas , minutes and other council business			2
' at the time i was elected mayor , i did not know i was going to be working abroad , ' he said			0
' i was elected to represent the town and i can still do that from @entity4 over the phone and via email			0
' there are some months , especially in the summer , when nothing happens at the council			0
we also have a very good deputy mayor who attends events in my absence			1
' but news of the long - distance arrangement sparked a row with residents calling for him to step down from his mayoral role , which ends in may			0
@entity62 : the huge distance between mr @entity5 ' home and @entity4 , where he is with a welfare - to - work firm one voter , 40 - year - old nurse @entity66 , said : ' we want to be represented by people who live and work in the area			1
you want your town mayor to have a hands - on approach			2
' now the council is considering having to pay an extra allowance to his deputy , who would normally receive £ 100 for the year			2
mr @entity29 admitted the situation was ' unfortunate '			0
yet town council leader @entity81 , also a @entity20 , defended the mayor and said the criticism came from ' political meddling '			1
' of the 15 events he 's attended they 've been major events , ' she told @entity88			1
' whilst some of the 26 may have been significant a number of them will have been turning up to somebody 's 90th birthday and giving them flowers			2
attack : one of mr @entity5 ' colleagues said he had shown ' contempt for the people of @entity8 ' ' a significant event would be something like the @entity100 or the @entity101 , both of which he attended			1
' he was chosen to be the mayor in may and the job opportunity came in june			0
it came out of the blue , these things happen sometimes and his company thought he was the best person for this particular job because it was something he 's very good at			0
' it 's about to finish			0
my understanding was it would happen before @entity113 but i believe he still has some loose ends to tie up			2
' ms @entity81 insisted the £ 400 allowance was crucial for the high number of drinks and raffle tickets the mayor is expected to buy at town events			2
' it 's a non-story , ' she said			0
' we know who 's raised this and it 's political meddling because there 's an election in may '			0
an independent councillor told @entity88 the situation was only revealed at a meeting after mr @entity5 had been in @entity4 for several months			2
@entity132 said : ' it 's ridiculous			1
it 's showing contempt for the people of @entity8			1
' he 's a brilliant bloke when he 's chairing meetings but the people of @entity8 deserve a mayor that 's actually there for them			1
' i brought the question up at the town council before , saying " why does n't the mayor turn up to anything " , and they just ummed and aahed			0
' recently we had a load of soldiers come back from fighting in @entity150 and they marched through @entity151 , a town just next to ours , and the mayor did n't turn up to that			1
' we had the @entity113 lights being turned on and the deputy stood in his place for that			1
' mr @entity132 said the mayor should step down and give the £ 400 allowance to his deputy			0
' people want a councillor they can talk to face to face , ' he added			0
' if they have issues like a leaning lamp post or a mouldy flat they ca n't always do these things over the phone			0
' spot the difference : the mayor 's tranquil home town of @entity8 , which has 17,000 inhabitants ... ... and the mayor 's new home @entity25 , the capital of @entity4 which has a population of almost 6million a former serviceman , @entity20 mr @entity5 joined the council in 2007 and stood for the larger @entity179 in 2011 , but was beaten by two @entity181 candidates			1
town councils , including @entity8 , are similar in size and set - up to parish councils			1
unlike the larger @entity179 which pays members more than £ 3,000 a year , councillors generally do not receive an allowance			0
a @entity26 spokesman said mr @entity5 was based in its @entity25 office and often travelled to the firm 's other four @entity4 offices in @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 and @entity195			1
a @entity197 spokesman said : ' it was agreed , following discussion with the leader of the @entity197 and the deputy town mayor that should the need arise , the deputy town mayor and / or @entity205 would be able to attend @entity206 as requested			2
' @entity207 has been appropriately represented throughout the current @entity208 and no invitations have been refused			0
councillor @entity5 has returned to the @entity210 during this period and completed all his @entity197 duties as required			0
' councillor @entity5 will continue to serve as @entity214 mayor and attend @entity215 until the conclusion of his @entity208			2
' despite the small scale of the council , mr @entity5 is not its first member to make headlines for moving away			2
husband and wife town councillors @entity221 and @entity224 tried to continue their posts despite moving more than 100 miles away to @entity226 in 2013			0
mrs @entity224 later stepped down , but her husband still represents the ward of @entity229			0
