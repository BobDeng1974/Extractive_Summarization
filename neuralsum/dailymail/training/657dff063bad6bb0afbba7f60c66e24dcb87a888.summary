by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 does not believe @entity5 's @entity4 preparations could have gone any better , thanks not only to the acclimatisation process but the club - like bond that it has helped create			1
the @entity5 are now just a day away from their @entity12 opener against @entity13 in the suffocating humidity of the @entity16 jungle			1
@entity18 's side have spent time in the @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 to prepare for the tough conditions of @entity24 , while warm - up matches against @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 have shown them first - hand the kind of opponents they could face in @entity31			1
team spirit : @entity5 left - back @entity2 says the @entity4 squad have a ' club - like ' spirit in @entity31 smile ! the @entity5 team pose for a photo on the bus ahead of their opener against @entity13 on saturday furthermore , @entity2 says the preparations have helped the @entity5 cultivate the kind of togetherness normally only seen at clubs			1
' i do n't think it could have gone much better to be honest , ' @entity2 said			1
' it 's been really enjoyable , we 've got some really good work in and spent some good time together			0
' the preparation in terms of the heat and the opponents has been really good			0
' for the time i 've been involved with @entity5 , this is as good a group as there 's been			2
' there 's a real good spirit throughout the camp and part of that is probably down to the preparation we 've been doing			2
' we 've been working hard but have obviously been spending a few weeks together that has enabled us to get that kind of club feel to the international set - up			2
' while the preparations may have been impressive , @entity2 knows now they have to translate that positive work onto the field			2
warm up : @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity2 gear up in @entity21 there are few tougher opening opponents than four - time @entity4 winners @entity13 , but @entity5 enter the match with an air of confidence just two years after exiting the @entity78 to the them			1
' we 're looking at [ @entity13 ] and being prepared for what they may have , but we 're focusing more on what we can do , ' @entity2 told www.thefa.com ' i think they 'll be doing similar things			1
there will be a lot of players in our squad that they 'll be doing their homework on and trying to make sure they 've got ideas on how to stop them			0
' you know what to expect from a side like @entity13 , they are one of the top sides in the world , full of good footballers and they 've tended to play in a certain style for a number of years , so we are preparing for that			2
' we 're looking forward to the game			0
we were talking before about the weather and things like that , but i do n't think there 's anyone who is really going to get an advantage from the weather			0
it 's going to be more or less the same for both sides			0
' @entity5 may , though , have gained a small advantage from the fact they arrived in @entity24 a day earlier than the @entity13			1
no fear : @entity2 says @entity5 are focusing on their own strengths , and not what @entity13 can do @entity18 's side made the long trip over from their @entity22 base on thursday morning , whereas @entity13 will only arrive in the @entity16 on the eve of the game			1
' it was about a three - and - a - half hour flight down to @entity24 , ' @entity2 said after the 1,774 - mile journey			1
' after arriving here at the hotel , we had a bit of work on the bikes to get the journey out of our legs and then watched the [ @entity31 v @entity134 ] game			0
' there was a good reception , young kids i 'm sure were excited to see some of their idols , people like @entity143 and @entity69			0
' it 's great to get down here to @entity24 and it puts us closer to being in match mode			2
' @entity2 is all - but certain to start at left - back for @entity5 on saturday , playing alongside @entity151 team - mate @entity150			1
the other @entity151 in the 23 - man squad is far less likely to start but has certainly made an impression , with many comparing 20 - year - old @entity154 to the @entity69 that burst onto the scene at @entity157			2
team - mates : @entity159 and @entity150 are both expected to start in @entity24 ' we know plenty about @entity162 because he 's been around longer than @entity154 has , ' @entity2 added			1
' he 's unbelievable for us as a club , he 's our captain and has been amazing over the years , he just gets on with his job			0
' he 's the type of player we always trust if we 're on attack and it breaks down , and you see someone coming up against him , you would always back him in any situation like that			0
he 's a terrific defender			0
' @entity154 we 're starting to see him develop and it 's exciting to watch him grow			0
' he 's one of the exciting players we 've got in the squad , he comes on in games , or if he starts a game , he can produce something out of nothing and get people of their seats			0

@entity2 says @entity5 's preparations could n't have been much better
team spirit is ' club - like ' , according to the @entity151 left - back
