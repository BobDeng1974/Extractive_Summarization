by @entity0 @entity2 's efforts to make it harder for governments to spy on ordinary citizens may be in vain			1
by using encryption , @entity2 believes it can limit the amount of spying done by governments on innocent people and force agencies to narrow their efforts to criminals , terrorists and suspected offenders , internet security experts told the @entity18			1
despite this push for added security , an expert who spoke to @entity22 believes it will do no more than delay spying efforts at best			0
@entity2 ’s encryption efforts were initially approved last june , but recent reports detailing the previously prism program have caused it to prioritize the project , according to the @entity18			1
spy headquarters : the @entity30 has been spying on ordinary americans for years , according to recent disclosures by encrypting information , firms are usually able to make it unintelligible to most anyone who comes across it – unless the encryption is broken			2
depending on the level of encryption , it forces more of an effort to crack open the data , but with @entity45 reporting this week that the @entity47 and @entity48 governments have been working to crack most forms of internet encryption since at least 2000 , it would appear they have the upper hand			1
that disclosure , along with @entity54 leak reports from the @entity56 and the @entity18 suggesting companies are basically turning on spigots that allow information to flow to the government nearly freely , has firms like @entity2 scrambling to protect client privacy			2
the reasoning behind bolstering encryption schemes is that governments and others who want to pry open the data of ordinary citizens will be forced to limit the scope of their hacking , technology firms argue			2
feverishly working : @entity2 has ramped up efforts to encrypt data after recent disclosures of the @entity77 spying program ‘ it ’s an arms race , ’ @entity78 , vice president for security engineering at @entity2 , told the @entity18			1
‘ we see these government agencies as among the most skilled players in this game			0
’ the @entity47 and @entity48 are n’t alone in their employment of cyber armies			0
reports have shown that @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and even @entity92 have legions of hackers awaiting their next marching orders			0
the @entity30 ( @entity30 ) has spent the last decade - plus using super computers to break codes , obtaining encryption keys and even influencing encryption standards ‘ to make them more vulnerable to outside attack , ’ according to @entity45 , making them nearly useless in the process			0
despite @entity2 using some of the brightest minds in the world to encrypt the data coursing through its networks and servers , that still ca n’t completely stop spooks from kicking down the door			2
‘ if the @entity30 wants to get into your system , they are going to get in , ’ a computer security expert told the @entity18 , adding that ‘ this is all about making dragnet surveillance impossible			0
’ almost finished : the new encryption project is expected to be finished soon , months ahead of schedule the agency declined to comment to the @entity18 and was not immediately able to be reached by @entity22 for comment			0
for a company the size of @entity2 , cost limits its ability to use a level of encryption that would cause anything more than a hiccup for government spies , according to @entity129 , an it specialist with a background in information security who spoke to @entity22			1
explaining that @entity2 is likely working to encrypt data ' at rest ' in servers , which makes it harder to crack , the @entity138 , @entity139 - based search giant is also increasing the amount of resources it needs to do the encryption and decryption , @entity129 said			1
@entity2 already encrypts @entity144 and its bread and butter search for most users , but the data flowing between data centers is what is most vulnerable , according to the @entity18			1
@entity77 : @entity30 's spying program , dubbed @entity77 , has been the subject of several recent media reports detailing the scope of @entity47 government spying copies of emails , search histories and even browsing histories for users race between data centers through much-less secure connections than the ones @entity2 has between it and users , the @entity18 said , basically providing what amounts to a back door for hackers			1
the firm ’s engineers are plowing forward to not only close that back door , but also fence it in			0
by encrypting each server and the information blasting through the fiber - optic lines between them using ‘ very strong ’ technology , experts told the @entity18 , @entity2 will have ‘ end to end ’ protection			1
the project should be finished months ahead of schedule , according to the @entity18			0
but if encryption is cracked for one user , hackers can use that exploit to root around the data of many users , @entity129 said , unless @entity2 tied individual encryption keys to user passwords			1
this would make them much harder to crack , but still not impossible , he added			0
resistance is futile : no matter how hard @entity2 's engineers work to outfox the government , the @entity30 will ultimately crack whatever encryption it sets its sights on no matter which route @entity2 is going , the @entity30 will eventually crack it , @entity129 argues			1
@entity2 was not immediately available for comment			0
' all the @entity30 has to do to break even the toughest encryption is train a few thousand supercomputers - which you can rent by the hour on it and it would take a few days to a few weeks ... it 's expensive , but it would eventually get through , ' said @entity129			0
' for every security mechanism put in place , there will eventually be technology to defeat it and , with the near limitless resources of the ' black ' agencies of the @entity47 government , it is comparatively easy for them to do it , ' @entity129 furthered			0
the level of encryption needed to be used by @entity2 , 2048 bit , is prohibitively expensive at the scale @entity2 would need , according to @entity129 , who suggested that @entity2 is perhaps scrambling to look less evil in the wake of the fallout from the @entity54 disclosures			2
' they can probably delay the @entity30 for a while , but i 'm of the viewpoint that the @entity30 will just work harder to crack it , ' @entity129 said , adding that ' @entity2 is probably using it more for marketing than actual security			2

the effort began in *earnest* over one year *ago* , but has *picked* up steam in the wake of @entity77 revelations
@entity2 will bolster the encryption of information flowing between data centers to create an ' end to end ' solution
the internet giant already encrypts @entity144 and most searches
despite their best efforts , it would take no more than a few weeks to crack the encrypted data
