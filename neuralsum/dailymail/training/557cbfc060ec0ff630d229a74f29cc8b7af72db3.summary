by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 will find out on thursday afternoon which of them has won @entity8 's @entity7			1
the accolade for @entity8 's top player in the 2013 - 14 season will be handed out during the draw for the @entity14 group stage			1
@entity15 takes a look at the three nominees , and why they are up for the coveted award			0
sweeper keeper : @entity2 is the best goalkepeer in the world and is up for the coveted award games played : 16 goals conceded : 11 @entity24 : 6 saves : 38 saves ( from inside the box ) : 27 saves ( from outside the box ) : 10 save percentage : 77.08 @entity29 : 1 penalties saved : 0 @entity2 the undisputed best goalkeeper in the world has had quite a year			1
at club level @entity33 swept the board domestically , winning the league and cup double			0
of course , @entity39 's side failed to retain their @entity14 title - but the @entity41 were defeated by eventual winners @entity42			2
but it is at international level where @entity2 excelled			0
his performances in @entity46 during @entity49 's @entity48 triumph were quite brilliant , merely underlining his position as the planet 's best			0
his ' goalsweeping ' style was a feature of @entity46 2014 - in essence acting like a 12th man for his team			0
he may have left @entity57 with his heart in his mouth a few times but it was certainly effective			0
12th outfield player : @entity2 spends so much time out of his box that he often plays like a defender games played : 17 goals : 6 total shots : 36 shots on @entity68 : 20 shooting accuracy : 56 % shot conversion : 17 % assists : 5 chances created : 30 passes : 529 passes successful : 436 @entity75 : 82.4 % @entity3 yes , he is a serial diver - but there 's no denying the @entity77 is one of the most effective attacking players in @entity8			1
technically there 's not many better , but where he differs from others is that there is almost always an end product - 22 goals from wide is no mean feat. his performance against @entity88 in the quarter - final second leg was breathtaking			1
his performances in the @entity48 were n't bad either - particularly in that 5 - 1 demolition of @entity92 in the group stages			2
@entity94 finished third in @entity46 , and much of their run was down to @entity3			0
he just needs to cut out the diving ! hotshot : @entity3 scored 22 goals last season , including three for @entity94 at the @entity48 diver ? @entity3 has infuriated opposition managers with his tendency to go down easily in the box games played : 15 goals : 14 total shots : 82 shots on @entity68 : 47 shooting accuracy : 57 % shot conversion : 17 % assists : 5 chances created : 28 passes : 444 passes successful : 353 @entity75 : 79.5 % @entity4 there is n't an awful lot more you can say about this guy , who was by far and say the best player in the world last season			1
51 goals and 15 assists in a single season tells its own story			1
@entity127 's injury - hit campaign thrust @entity4 even more into the limelight and the @entity129 thrived on the attention			0
there was n't a more potent attacking force than @entity4 last season - his shirtless celebration following his late penalty in the @entity14 final win over local rivals @entity136 was one of the most memorable moments of last season			2
it was a shame , however , that he could n't carry that form into the @entity48 as @entity142 crashed out in the group stages			2
you ca n't have everything , though			0
unstoppable : @entity4 smashed in 56 goals last season , and helped @entity42 win the @entity14 fourth time lucky : @entity4 has finished third in the award 's standings for three years in a row @entity150 double against @entity151 secured @entity152			1
