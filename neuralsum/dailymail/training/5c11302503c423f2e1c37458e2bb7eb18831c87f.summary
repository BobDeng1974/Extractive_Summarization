@entity0 and 2015 promises to be an exciting year for rugby with the @entity2 taking place in @entity4 in september and october			2
but the year starts , in @entity5 , with the return leg of the @entity7 on friday at @entity8 and my @entity10 wish is that we get a better game than we had last week at @entity14			1
but before i get to the rugby , i really think this game is a missed opportunity			0
i am told they are expecting a crowd of 12,000 to 14,000 which is way above @entity21 ’s average home attendance			1
but why are we not trying to fill @entity22 ? @entity24 filled @entity26 ’s 82,000 seats last week for their match against @entity28 , @entity23 move the @entity30 game to the @entity31 and get 50,000 and @entity32 have had 90,000 in @entity33			0
they have all done this by getting two things right , first marketing the game properly and second , get the ticket prices right			0
@entity24 titled their game last week ‘ @entity40 ’ and by doing this they created a product that they priced right and sold the product using social media as a way to attract new fans			0
they put on entertainment which meant the whole experience was one that will entice some of the first - timers to come back to another game			0
a general view of @entity22 in @entity21 last september @entity26 was packed for the @entity54 match between @entity24 and @entity28 last week @entity55 has marketed this game in the usual way they always market the game and , as a result , they will get the usual crowd			1
this was a great opportunity to try something different as everyone is looking for something to do by the 2nd january			0
i would love to have seen an attempt made to fill @entity22 and try and attract the latent support for rugby that exists in @entity21			1
remember , 38,000 fans came to @entity8 to see @entity21 play @entity71 in the @entity72 a few years ago so the support is there , it just needs to be attracted in			1
make the tickets £ 10 for adults and kids free , bombard social media and other advertising mediums with a campaign to ‘ @entity8 , and get people talking about the game			2
as usual at this time of the year , i have been at many social gatherings yet nobody was talking about the game at @entity8 which is a shame			2
aim for 60,000 and if you only get 40,000 on first attempt , make sure the experience is such that we fill it the following year			0
there is an element of a feel - good factor within @entity55 with @entity92 doing so well and @entity5 having a promising @entity93 so this was the time to try something different			1
none of this is ground breaking , it is what many clubs have done with success for a number of years and i hope we have a crack at this next year			0
@entity21 players applaud their @entity92 opponents off the pitch after the first leg of the @entity7 if we do want a bigger crowd to attend these matches , the quality of rugby on offer needs to be better than we saw in the first leg and i think it will be on friday			1
the big @entity8 pitch and the quality of the new pitch should allow this to happen but the attitude of both teams needs to be better than last week			1
both teams seemed only concerned with stopping the opposition playing and this played right into @entity21 ’s hands			2
they have made themselves hard to play against with being strong in defence and very competitive in the tackle area			0
they lack creativity and have picked @entity131 at stand off when i felt they looked more dangerous when he was moved to full back last week			0
but they still have quality players in @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 and these guys will be desperate to put one over the team that have dominated the @entity5 game for a number of years now			0
@entity144 ' @entity143 crosses the line to score a try in the first leg last week @entity92 have the better players and , if they get their off - loading game going which allows their dangerous runners to find space , they will cause @entity21 all sorts of problems			1
the selection of @entity155 is interesting as he is a specialist open side which would suggest @entity92 intend to play a faster and wider game than last week			1
this may have been decided for them with @entity160 ’ s injury but @entity155 ’ battle with @entity163 at the breakdown will be key			0
@entity92 have too much quality for @entity21 in the starting team as well as the bench where they have the luxury of bringing on two @entity170 in @entity171 and @entity172 so i expect @entity92 to win			1
if they get their attitude and execution right they could even get the bonus point win as well as the @entity7 for another year .			2

the return leg of the @entity7 takes place at @entity8 on friday night
@entity92 beat @entity21 16 - 6 in the first leg last week
a crowd of 12,000 to 14,000 is expected in @entity21
