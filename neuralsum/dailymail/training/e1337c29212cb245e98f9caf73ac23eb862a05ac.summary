by @entity0 published : 17:47 est , 6 march 2013 updated : 21:12 est , 6 march 2013 remembered : more than 200 people attended @entity3 's funeral at @entity5 's @entity4 near the actor 's home in @entity8 yesterday had @entity10 been allowed to organise his own funeral , his remains would surely have been finely mulched and scattered on the soil of the @entity14 's suburban garden			1
the guests would have toasted his memory with a glass of home - made pea - pod burgundy , and @entity20 , perhaps , would have turned up in clothing more appropriate for @entity22 's than the cabbage patch			2
what a splendid final episode it would have made for a tv series that captivated most of the viewing nation , including the @entity28 , for three years during the 1970s - then went on to win millions more fans through repeats around the world			0
but the finale they gave yesterday to actor @entity3 recalled far more than his portrayal of @entity10 and the self - sufficient life in @entity36 that he and screen wife @entity37 championed			2
instead , a congregation of family and friends joined a cast list from the last half century of film , theatre , tv and comedy to pay tribute to the real @entity3 - father , grandfather , family clown to his young grandchildren , lover of @entity51 , and a man with no pretence at celebrity			2
thus , the small church near his @entity8 home became a reunion hall for names and faces long familiar to @entity61 audiences , among them @entity62 , who played @entity37 , and @entity63 , who played @entity20 , now with a combined age approaching 140			1
actors including @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 joined the congregation , as did his great friends sir @entity73 and @entity74			2
@entity75 , the @entity76 in @entity77 , brought applause with a reading of @entity82 's @entity81 's @entity80 ; and @entity83 , @entity3 ' co-star from @entity84 , read from the death of sir @entity86			1
paying tribute : the actor 's co-stars in @entity90 , @entity62 ( left ) and @entity63 ( right ) loving couple : the late actor 's wife @entity92 at the service near their @entity8 home yesterday also there were some of the so - called ordinary people whose lives @entity100 touched simply through his ability to treat everyone equally - and , crucially - to make them laugh			1
' he was n't starry , ' said father @entity104 , @entity105 of @entity5 's @entity106			1
' he knew everyone , from the pet - shop owner to the newsagent , to near neighbours ... ' the last time the pair met , he revealed , @entity3 was complaining that he had to give a speech to the @entity113			0
' i 'm not even bloody religious , ' he told father @entity104			1
' well , ' the minister told the congregation as he looked around the church yesterday			0
' he suggested @entity3 would currently be ' performing at the heavenly banquet ' and added : ' forgive me if i say about him : it was a good life			0
' famous faces : the service was attended by stars from the world of television , film and theatre , including @entity131 ( left ) and @entity69 ( right ) hit show : picture from @entity90 showing @entity3 with @entity62 , who played @entity37 a really good life : @entity3 ( second left ) in a 1975 episode of the @entity14 with @entity62 ( left ) , @entity63 ( centre right ) and @entity137 ( right ) more than 200 people attended the funeral , some who knew him more as a likeable local than as one of the country 's best loved sit - com stars			1
few outsiders will have known , for example , that he and his ex-actress wife @entity146 lived for 45 years in a suburb not unlike the @entity14 's portrayal of @entity36			0
popular : @entity3 in his most famous role as @entity10 in @entity90 , alongside @entity63 he was a familiar face at charity and social events there and was frequently the self - effacing guest of honour at the @entity156 annual festival , @entity5			1
he was also a great family man - evident not least from the wedding and family photographs incorporated into the order of service			2
one showed him carrying his bride , @entity146 , on the first day of a 1956 marriage that would last until his death last month ; another as a young man with his daughters @entity167 and @entity169			0
the cover photograph showed him as many may remember him - smiling in the sunshine on a bench in the garden			0
yesterday @entity169 told the service the family had been overwhelmed with messages of condolence in the wake of her father 's death			1
one suggested : ' it must seem strange to be sharing such a time of grief with the whole country			0
' ' it was n't , ' @entity169 told us			0
' it was with a feeling of awe and comfort that one man could have had such a powerful and positive affect on people - and that that man was my dad			0
' as they left the service , guests signed a memorial book to be presented to his family after a private cremation			1
@entity131 may have echoed @entity3 ' view when she shared a joke with a message that read : ' i simply ca n't understand what all the fuss is about			1
' recognition : @entity3 after receiving his cbe , pictured with his wife @entity146 and grandchildren @entity210 and @entity211 at @entity212 old friends : the actor with his @entity216 co-star and lifelong friend @entity69 during an interview for the @entity219 celebrated : mr @entity3 was most famous for his sitcoms but was also an outstanding classical actor and voice over artist underneath she wrote : ' get a bloody haircut - yours , @entity226			0
' @entity73 , who signed @entity3 to his @entity227 in 1987 and featured him in nine @entity51 film productions , wrote : ' with love to a darling man			1
' afterwards he said of the service : ' i think he would have thought it was wonderful			2
' and the fictional mr good ? at least he finally fulfilled his dream to escape the rat - race			0
much - loved : @entity3 , who died aged 79 , is pictured in this 1973 grab from @entity240 on @entity241			0
