row : executive chairman of @entity2 @entity1 says his company does n't need to pay much tax in @entity5 @entity2 was yesterday accused of leaving @entity5 taxpayers out of pocket after avoiding more than £ 200million of tax			1
the internet giant , which has a history of minimising its contribution to the nation ’s coffers , faces a fresh backlash over its financial affairs			2
company accounts show that last year @entity2 raked in £ 2.6billion in revenues from its @entity5 operations , which are officially based in @entity19			2
but the group admitted it paid only £ 6million to the exchequer during 2011			1
the sum is £ 218million short of what it should have coughed up , tax experts said			1
the shortfall deprives @entity27 of much - needed money to fund public services , leaving ordinary taxpayers to make up the difference			0
the company has long been accused of doing cosy deals with the taxman to minimise its bill			0
@entity2 ’s @entity5 arm claimed it made only £ 395million turnover in 2011			0
but figures released by its parent company in @entity41 , @entity2 , show that the @entity5 division had revenues of $ 4billion ( £ 2.6billion ) during the year			0
tax accountant @entity44 said the company achieved this by registering its @entity5 arm as a services business , which allows it artificially to deflate its real sales figures			1
it does this by channelling its @entity5 operations – and revenues earned here – as a ' service ' to @entity19 , where corporation tax is lower			1

home : @entity2 has its headquarters in @entity64 , pictured , but paid a small amount of tax again this year ' the anticipated tax rate on this would be 26.5 per cent , which would give rise to taxes due of £ 224million			1
and instead it paid £ 6million , which is £ 218million gone astray needing to be accounted for			0
’ he said the group is ' ignoring its own maxim of “ do no evil ” and is inconsistent with its own social goals '			0
it is not the first time the company ’s tax contribution has come under scrutiny			1
in 2010 it paid £ 5million in tax , despite making sales in the @entity5 of £ 2.1billion			1
@entity2 ’s executive chairman @entity1 has previously derided loopholes in the system , saying the company was obliged to pay the legal minimum			1
' we could pay more [ @entity5 ] tax but we would have to do so voluntarily , ' he said last year			1
figures released last night by @entity2 showed that , in 2011 , the company ’s @entity5 arm made a loss of £ 20.7million before tax			2

it said annual accounts , which would give full details , would be available on financial database @entity107 yesterday			0
none was , and @entity107 denied having received figures from @entity2			0

' @entity2 was founded in 1998 by @entity132 , 39 , and @entity133 , 38 , who had met at @entity134 in @entity41 three years earlier			0
