by @entity0 @entity2 's legendary coach @entity1 admitted he may face the axe after the humiliating @entity5 exit following the 2 - 0 defeat by @entity7 in the @entity8			1
it is the first time the reigning champions have been knocked out of the @entity5 after just two matches and a number of @entity14 players are also facing the chop for the shameful showing			1
@entity7 have qualified from @entity17 along with @entity18 after goals from @entity20 and @entity21 secured victory while @entity2 's loss , coupled with last week ’s 5 - 1 defeat by @entity18 has sent them crashing out			2
lost for ideas : @entity1 could not inspire his side to repeat their heroics from 2008 , 2010 and 2012 new feeling : @entity1 has been used to success but found himself on the end of two defeats in @entity34 @entity1 said he need to take time to think about his own future and ' what is good for @entity14 football '			1
' it ’s true that when such things happen during a @entity5 or a tournament like this then it has consequences but i do n’t want to start thinking about that right now			2
we have time to analyse that and it is not the right time now			0
' there will be time to think and reflect what we are going to do			0
i think this team is good but we have to take a decision about what is good for @entity14 football and that applies to myself as well			1
' head scratcher : @entity1 will take time out before making a decision on his managerial future alone : the @entity2 coach looked dejected on the touchline as @entity2 failed in their task at the @entity8 @entity1 said @entity2 had been too timid in the first half against @entity7 which saw @entity2 2 - 0 down at the break and with a mountain to climb			1
' in the first half we were really shy and sluggish and not brave enough so @entity7 were able to put the pressure on us			0
' in the second half we had more space and some chances but i am trying to find excuses - we played worse than @entity7 and @entity18 and so we have lost			1
' pressure : the successful @entity14 coach oversaw big defeats to @entity18 and @entity7 in @entity34 frustration : the @entity5 winner simply failed to get the best out of his world - class squad video reigning champions out as @entity7 stampede @entity7 ’s @entity83 coach @entity82 had sympathetic words for @entity2 , whose winning streak of two @entity87 either side of a @entity5 has come to a sorry end			1
he said : ' in football everything changes			0
@entity2 has played very well over the years and had wonderful performances but today that generation of players could n’t keep that success going , and that ’s normal because success is not forever			0
' @entity82 said @entity7 would now go all out to beat the @entity97 and finish top of their group which would avoid a likely meeting with hosts @entity34			0
all over : @entity103 rues @entity2 's defeat to @entity7 which ends their reign as @entity5 holders he added : ' against @entity18 we will have the same approach knowing we need to win to be first in our group			2
' if we do n’t win against @entity18 we will probably have to play @entity34 if they win against @entity112			0
' considering our performances the most important thing is to play as a team - and that ’s why we have been so dangerous and have had such good results			0
' end of an era : @entity1 and @entity119 are unlikely to be at the @entity120 @entity5 in 2018 contrast : four years ago @entity122 was lifting the trophy , now he faces the sack			2

@entity5 and @entity127 - winning coach to take time out
' we have to take a decision about what is good for @entity14 football
