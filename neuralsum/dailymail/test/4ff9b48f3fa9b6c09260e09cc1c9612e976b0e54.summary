the prime minister this morning faced the first serious criticism of the campaign so far , as @entity10 donors rounded on the party 's lacklustre message and failure to pull away in the polls			1
but a defiant mr @entity0 this afternoon pledged to continue focussing on bread - and - butter issues like jobs , business and childcare			1
if you want more showbiz in this election			2
' but here and now in the @entity31 i 'm focused on something real – a stronger economy			0
' mr @entity0 insisted the economy ' excites ' millions of people			1
he said he would campaign on ' more jobs , more homes , more business , more childcare , more security in retirement '			2
he said : ' i make no apologies for focusing hard on that which is central to everything			0
when you get a new job , a new home , get a new childcare place or start a new business … now that 's truly exiting			0
' and you only get these things with a strong and stable government - not one held to ransom			0
that 's not the excitement ' @entity31 needs			0
that 's not a risk @entity31 should take			0
' mr @entity0 's remarks comes amid claims senior @entity10 figures are already planning to make @entity66 the next leader			1
some mps are prepared to engineer a coup against mr @entity0 in the days after may 7 by submitting letters of no - confidence in him and planning a ' mass show of support ' for the @entity75 mayor if the @entity76 lose , the @entity67 reported			1
one major donor , who declined to be named , told the newspaper : ' @entity66 is the only one who can win			1
everyone knows what is going to happen in 10 days ' time			0
if @entity83 does n't make it we 'll get rid of him			0
' the @entity76 have nudged ahead in the polls with less than two weeks to go until polling day , but @entity76 are increasingly concerned it may be too little too late @entity75 mayor @entity66 - appearing on the @entity89 's @entity88 show this morning , has distanced himself from claims that he is being lined up to replace @entity0 as @entity10 leader multimillionaire @entity10 donor @entity92 , who has given almost £ 600,000 to the @entity10 party since 2005 , meanwhile has criticised mr @entity0 's ' curious lack of energy and belief in his campaign			1
' he said the @entity99 needs to raise his game and ' unleash visceral passion and belief in his vision of the future ' , ' get down and dirty ' , as well as showing ' he cares ' , if he is to win on may 7			2
' if we do n't have a @entity10 government after may 7 it will be because of @entity0			1
his decision not to keep those @entity110 people in the @entity10 tribe was a key error			2
' i see no powerful vision of the future provided by @entity0			2
there is no clear considered view of where we are headed			0
' mr @entity92 warned that @entity0 's mantra as a sound steward of the economy ' is not enough to win the votes needed to win the election ' and added : ' some people are really quite resigned to losing and they are planning the next step			1
' it 's a horrifying prospect if we were to lose			0
how can we lose when so much is at stake and when we have such a strong hand ? '			0
