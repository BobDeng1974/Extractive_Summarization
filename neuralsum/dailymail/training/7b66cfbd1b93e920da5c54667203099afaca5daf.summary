it weighs six tonnes , it 's spinning out of control and now @entity2 says it is going to plunge back to @entity3 sooner than expected			1
@entity2 space junk experts say the giant satellite is plummeting quicker than expected , with the @entity7 space agency now predicting the climate probe will smash to ground on september 23 , a day earlier than previously reported			1
and there is a one in 3,200 chance that pieces of the defunct satellite could hit someone when it does crash land			1
it would be the first time in history someone was injured by space debris			1
danger : the six - ton @entity22 will crash to @entity3 and could land in @entity23 best guess : the satellite could fall anywhere between the two latitudes , where billions of people live the @entity22 , or @entity22 , ran out of fuel in 2005 and could land on any of six continents			1
@entity2 says it could land at any point between 57 degrees north and 57 degrees south - which includes almost all the populated areas of our planet ( see map below )			1
the bus - size satellite was expected to fall to @entity3 sometime this year , with experts initially pencilling a week - long window between late september and early october , then narrowing it to the last week of this month			1
that window , @entity2 now says , has been trimmed to just three days			1
're - entry is expected sept. 23 , plus or minus a day			1
the re-entry of @entity22 is advancing because of a sharp increase in solar activity since the beginning of this week , ' @entity2 officials wrote in a status update yesterday			1
@entity2 spokeswoman @entity46 confirmed with @entity47 earlier today that the reason @entity22 is expected to fall early is because of the sharp increase in solar activity			1
solar effects from the sun can create an extra drag on satellites in space because they can heat the @entity3 's atmosphere , causing it to expand , agency officials have said			2
astronomer dr @entity59 , from the @entity23 @entity60 , says the @entity3 's atmosphere slows down falling satellites a great deal			0
he explained that what remains of @entity22 will hit the ground relatively slowly and ' certainly not at orbital velocity of 17,500mph '			2
much of any satellite crashing to @entity3 will be disintegrated by heat , caused by friction with the atmosphere			0
it 's the reason we get shooting stars - created by meteors burning up in the upper atmosphere			0
@entity22 is large enough , though , that up to half a ton will strike the ground			0
it will probably not be in one piece , however : space vehicles experience incredible stress on re-entry			2
the load can be as much as @entity81			0
an @entity83 car experiences around @entity84 with maximum braking from high speed			0
the reason why the location of the crash site is so hard to predict is because the density of the atmosphere varies so greatly higher up , producing different amounts of drag			2
a prediction that was wrong by even a few minutes would mean the satellite landing a huge distance away , owing to its speed			0
most of the satellite will burn up during re-entry , but a hefty half - tonne of metal will still plummet to the @entity3 's surface			0
it ’s being tracked by the @entity105 of @entity106 at @entity107 in @entity108 , but @entity2 admits it has no idea where it will come down , or when			1
it predicts that it will enter the atmosphere in late september , but it could be october			2
the space agency said that the crash site will be anywhere between 57 degrees north latitude and 57 degrees south latitude and the remains could scatter over a 500mile area			1
that means pieces of it could land in @entity122 – or somewhere in @entity123			2
however some experts believe it will fall into the one of the planet 's oceans			2
' look at how much of @entity3 is covered with water , ' @entity128 , the @entity129 office director of the @entity130 , an organisation dedicated to the peaceful use of outer space , told @entity47 this week			2
' there 's a really good chance it 's going to go straight into the ocean			0
' and a @entity2 spokesman pointed out that there has yet to be any reported injury from falling space debris			1
he said : ‘ the risk to public safety or property is extremely small , and safety is @entity2 's top priority			1
since the beginning of the @entity148 in the late - 1950s , there have been no confirmed reports of an injury resulting from re-entering space objects			2
‘ nor is there a record of significant property damage resulting from a satellite re-entry			0
’ this satellite is far smaller than the 135 - ton @entity159 space station @entity160 , which fell to @entity3 in 2001 or the 100 - ton @entity161 that fell in 1979			0
@entity160 fell into the @entity162 , while @entity161 hit the @entity163 and parts of sparsely populated western @entity165			0
because two - thirds of the @entity3 is ocean , space debris usually hits water			0
@entity2 is urging anyone who finds a piece of the @entity22 satellite not to touch it			1
the spokesman added : ‘ if you find something you think may be a piece of @entity22 , do not touch it			0
contact a local law enforcement official for assistance			0
’ it was launched back in 1991 by the @entity180 to measure ozone levels , wind speeds and temperatures in the stratosphere			0
junk yard in space : @entity22 is one of the thousands of objects in @entity3 orbit being tracked by @entity2 , as shown by this computer graphic but now it 's one of 370,000 pieces of junk floating in space at speeds of up to 22,000mph			1
the volume of debris was greatly increased by a 2007 @entity200 anti-satellite weapon test and a 2009 crash - in - orbit of two satellites			0
the widely criticised @entity200 test used a missile to smash an ageing weather satellite into 150,000 pieces of 1cm debris and 3,118 pieces can be tracked by radar on the ground .			0

new date for crash land set for september 23 , say @entity2 space junk experts
it ran out of fuel in 2005 and @entity2 has no idea where it will hit
