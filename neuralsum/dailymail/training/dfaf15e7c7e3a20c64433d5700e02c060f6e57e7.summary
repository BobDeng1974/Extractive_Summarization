it can be easy to dismiss talks on global warming if your part of the world is feeling colder than usual			1
but a new study claims that while the world is getting warmer , the heating effect on the @entity8 has not been uniform across the planet			2
the research provides the first detailed analysis of global land surface warming trends over the century			2
a new study claims that while the world is getting warmer , the heating effect on the @entity8 has not been uniform across the planet			2
this graphic shows how temperatures have changed from 1910 - 2000 over different latitudes ‘ global warming was not as understood as we thought , ’ said @entity20 , an assistant professor of meteorology at @entity22			1
professor @entity20 used a newly - developed analysis method on historical temperature records to examine land surface temperature trends from 1900 onward for the entire globe , minus @entity29			0
previous work by scientists on global warming could not provide information of non-uniform warming in location and time due to limitations of analysis methods			0

from 1910 to 1980 , while the rest of the world was warming , areas south of the equator - near the @entity44 = were cooling down according to the study the research comes as @entity50 secretary - general , ban ki - moon , urges the world 's policymakers to do more to address the threat of climate change a spike in @entity57 sea temperatures and the rapid movement of warm water eastwards have increased fears that this year 's @entity61 could be one of the strongest yet			1
@entity61 - a warming of sea - surface temperatures in the @entity57 - affects wind patterns and can trigger both floods and drought in different parts of the globe			2
although previous research has suggested extreme @entity61 events could occur later this year , experts claim this recent rise hints they are likely to be more significant than first thought			2
dr @entity75 , a climate expert at @entity77 's @entity76 , said the rises in @entity57 temperature were above those seen in previous @entity61 years			0
‘ i think this event has lots of characteristics with a strong @entity61 , ’ said @entity75			0
he based his conclusions on studying data released by the @entity87 @entity86			0
the research team found that noticeable warming first started around the regions circling the @entity92 and subtropical regions in both hemispheres			1
but the largest warming to date has been at the northern mid-latitudes			1
the research team also found that in some areas of the world , cooling had occurred			1
‘ the global warming is not uniform , ’ professor @entity100 said			0
‘ you have areas that have cooled and areas that have warmed			0
’ for example , from about 1910 to 1980 , while the rest of the world was warming up , some areas south of the @entity106 , such as those near the @entity44 , were cooling down , and then had no change at all until the mid- 1990s			1
other areas near and south of the @entity106 did n't see significant changes comparable to the rest of the world at all			1
the detailed picture of when and where the world has warmed or cooled will provide a greater context to global warming research overall , professor @entity20 said			1
the research comes as @entity50 secretary - general urges the world ’s policymakers to do more to address the threat of climate change			1
the largest warming to date has been at the northern mid latitudes , according to the @entity22 study speaking to hundreds of international delegates at the start of a climate gathering in @entity133 , ban ki - moon warned that time is running out to reduce harmful emissions and that political leaders need to offer bold commitments to drive meaningful change			1
‘ if we do not take urgent action , all our plans for increased global prosperity and security will be undone , ’ he warned			0
@entity129 was in the @entity145 capital to mark the start of a conference meant to lay the groundwork for a climate summit he has called for world leaders in september			0
the aim of the process is to get governments to agree to cut emissions after 2020 to keep warming below 1.2 degrees @entity157 compared to today 's levels			0
global temperatures already have risen 0.8 ° c since record - keeping began in the 19th century .			0

from 1910 to 1980 , study found areas south of the equator cooled down
other areas near the equator did n't see significant changes in warming
it found largest warming to date has been at the northern mid latitudes
the research comes as @entity50 secretary - general urges the world ’s policymakers to do more to address the threat of climate change
