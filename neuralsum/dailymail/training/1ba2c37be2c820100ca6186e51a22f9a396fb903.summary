for years , @entity1 wine has been dismissed as being no match for more sophisticated vintages from across the @entity4			1
but brilliant weather and clever grape choices mean that , this year , experts believe wines from @entity1 and @entity9 — where there are now 432 vineyards — may be as good as , if not even superior to , their @entity13 rivals			1
so we asked wine expert @entity15 to take a ‘ blind ’ taste test to see if this can really be true			1
we chose eight popular wines with similar blends , vintages and prices			1
could @entity15 tell the difference between the @entity1 crop and @entity26 versions — and which did she prefer ? for years , @entity1 wine has been dismissed as being no match for more sophisticated vintages from across the @entity4			1
so we asked wine expert @entity15 to take a ‘ blind ’ taste test to see if this can really be true			1
white @entity30 , 2013 , @entity31 £ 16.99 , @entity32 , winepantry.co.uk @entity33 says : wow			2
it ’s as silky and smooth as a baby ’s bottom , with a little talcum powder sweetness			2
i love the gentle perfume and the hint of sweetness			2
it ’s head and shoulders above its @entity46 rival			2
it ’s hard to believe our favourite tipple , @entity46 pinot grigio , is made from the same grape			2
this is light - years better and worth the extra bucks			2
it ’s so deliciously different — i ’m plumping for an exciting @entity1 wine producer			1
@entity33 ’s @entity56 : @entity1 @entity57 and @entity58 correct @entity59 , 2013 , @entity60 £ 8.99 , @entity61 , majestic.co.uk @entity33 says : very ‘ so what ? ’			1
it tastes a lot rougher — like biting into a conker			2
you ’d need some food to mop up the rather harsh flavour			2
it ’s a bog - standard @entity26 wine — i suspect from @entity71			2
very traditional with no crowd appeal			0
@entity33 ’s @entity56 : @entity26 correct @entity33 ’s favourite : @entity1 @entity74 , 2013 , @entity75 £ 9.99 , @entity76 , waitrose.co.uk @entity33 says : a reasonable white — i think a mix of chardonnay and other grapes			1
the slightly unpleasant fizziness reminds me of drinking liver salts for a hangover			0
the grapes taste very fresh , which i put down to young vines and not enough sun. that means it ’s @entity1			1
@entity33 ’s @entity56 : @entity1 correct @entity88 , 2013 , @entity89 £ 9.49 , @entity90 , marksandspencer.com @entity33 says : the rich , straw colour suggests a grape from mature vines ripened under a hot @entity95 sun. it ’s a very acceptable chardonnay with a satisfying peachy and slightly nutty flavour — and no fizziness			1
@entity33 ’s @entity56 : @entity26 correct @entity33 ’s favourite : @entity26 @entity99 @entity100 @entity101 , 2013 , @entity102 , @entity103 £ 16 , @entity32 , winepantry.co.uk @entity33 says : @entity104 used to be dismissed as a girlie drink — cheap , cheerful and a bit too sweet			0
but it ’s grown up massively , as this lovely bottle proves			0
the great thing about a good rosé like this is it has enough dryness and depth of flavour to complement every style of food			0
i doubt it ’s @entity1 because i do n’t believe any producer has cracked rosé yet			1
@entity33 ’s @entity56 : @entity26 wrong @entity121 , 2013 , @entity122 £ 14,99 , @entity76 , waitrose.co.uk @entity33 says : they ’re so alike , they could be twins			0
this has the same streamlined quality and depth			0
it ’s a tough call , but i ’m going for @entity1			1
@entity33 ’s @entity56 : @entity1 wrong @entity33 ’s favourite : even @entity130 , 2013 , @entity131 £ 9.49 , @entity76 , waitrose.co.uk @entity33 says : just one sniff and my teeth are on edge			1
it smells sickly sweet and tastes horribly sugary			0
it ’s like eating a three - year - old ’s mashed - up sweetie collection			2
i ’m getting everything from @entity141 to bubblegum			0
i reckon it ’s @entity1			1
they ’ve jumped on the rosé bandwagon and tried too hard			0
@entity33 ’s @entity56 : @entity1 correct @entity147 , 2013 , @entity148 £ 8.99 , @entity61 , majestic.co.uk @entity33 says : this is a gorgeous pinot noir			1
it ’s a coral colour and smells of strawberries and cream			0
it tastes deliciously clean , dry and not too sweet			0
it ’s everything i want from a producer who knows his stuff , so i believe it ’s an experienced @entity26 grower			0
@entity33 ’s @entity56 : @entity26 correct @entity33 ’s favourite : @entity26 @entity160 @entity161 and @entity162 @entity163 , 2011 , @entity75 £ 17.45 , @entity164 , bbr.com @entity33 says : @entity165			0
this can not possibly be @entity1 because we struggle to make good red			1
pinot noir ’s a tricksy little grape			0
like a flirty girl , she ’s incredibly fussy and demanding and will storm out unless the conditions are perfect			0
i reckon this is from @entity89 — home of the pinot noir			0
@entity33 ’s @entity56 : @entity26 wrong @entity176 , 2013 , @entity89 £ 12.99 , @entity61 , majestic.co.uk @entity33 says : a really mediocre burgundy — definitely @entity1			1
we may have come on by leaps and bounds with sparkling and white wine , but our temperature makes it really hard to ripen grapes enough to produce a smooth red			2
this is like drinking red wine and soda			2
@entity33 ’s @entity56 : @entity1 wrong my favourite : @entity1 @entity190 , 2013 , @entity31 £ 15.99 , @entity32 , winepantry.co.uk @entity33 says : it ’s a little acidic , which makes me think the grapes are under - ripe			1
a good burgundy should be smoother and more rounded			0
it ’s a good effort but i reckon it ’s from a new @entity1 producer			1
@entity33 ’s @entity56 : @entity1 correct @entity199 , 2012 , @entity89 £ 8.69 , @entity200 , tesco.co.uk @entity33 says : this is n’t a great burgundy			1
there ’s a rather unpleasant lingering aftertaste of compost			0
and it ’s rough around the edges			0
but i still reckon it ’s @entity26			0
@entity33 ’s @entity56 : @entity26 correct @entity33 ’s favourite : @entity26 @entity212 rosé and @entity104 sparkling @entity213 , 2009 , @entity31 , £ 31.99 , @entity76 , waitrose.co.uk @entity33 says : this is @entity1 — and all the better for it			1
it manages to do everything a good champagne should			0
it ’s soft , delicate , subtle and incredibly moreish			0
i ’m convinced it ’s from the @entity219 , where the best @entity1 fizz is from			1
believe it or not , the average temperature is marginally warmer than in @entity222 itself			0
making champagne this good is like climbing @entity225 — and they ’ve done it			0
hooray ! @entity33 ’s @entity56 : @entity1 correct @entity227 , @entity228 , champagne £ 31.99 , @entity200 , tesco.co.uk @entity33 says : it ’s hard to credit this bog - standard champagne is made from the same grape following the same method			1
unlike the delicious @entity1 fizz , it tastes as if it has been thrown together on a production line			1
the producers are resting on their laurels and it shows			0
@entity33 ’s @entity56 : @entity26 correct my favourite : @entity1 @entity242 , @entity228 , @entity75 £ 22 , @entity90 , marksandspencer.com @entity33 says : delicately fizzy — just how rosé champagne should be			1
@entity104 used to be a smoke screen for inferior quality because you can hide shortcomings with a boost of sugar			0
but pink fizz has pulled its socks up			0
i think it ’s @entity26 because — while we ’ve mastered champagne — we still have n’t cracked sparkling rosé			0
@entity33 ’s @entity56 : @entity26 wrong @entity259 , @entity228 , champagne £ 21.59 ( normally £ 26.99 ) , @entity76 , waitrose.co.uk @entity15 says she 's thrilled she got some wrong and that she preferred some @entity1 wines @entity33 says : this is lovely , but not quite as good			1
i like the rounded , gentle taste but it needs more body			2
unlike any other rosé , champagne rosé is made by adding red wine to white wine , blending and then making it fizzy			2
normally you would ferment with red skins to give the body			0
i think it ’s @entity1 because the other is undoubtedly @entity26			1
@entity33 ’s @entity56 : @entity1 wrong my favourite : @entity1 @entity33 ’s overall verdict : i ’m actually thrilled i got some wrong and that i preferred some @entity1			1
it proves how far our wines have come			2
we have been creeping up to challenge @entity26 for the past few years			0
and now , as this shows , we ’ve done it ! overall score : @entity1 wine : 4 @entity26 wine : 3			1

@entity1 wine has been seen as no match for wines from across the channel
brilliant weather means this year wines from @entity1 may be superior
we chose eight popular wines with similar blends
