an incredible 2,500 bookings were taken at @entity1 and @entity3 's new restaurant within four hours of its website going live - and friday and saturday tables are now full until november			1
the amazing demand for the pair 's @entity7 in @entity9 , @entity10 , suggests the new opening is going to be one of the hottest tables in town this winter			1
but it seems it wo n't be alone , as industry experts are expecting an ' unprecedented ' boom in new restaurants in the capital over the coming months			1
overwhelmed : @entity3 said he could n't believe the response his and @entity1 's new food venture had received airy : an artist 's impression of how the @entity7 will look when it opens in september new eatery : @entity3 has joined forces with @entity1 to launch @entity7 which will open next month urban feel : the design will incorporate the building 's existing industrial - style ceilings and exposed brick twenty new establishments in the next four weeks alone are set to open in @entity10 , including from former @entity3 protege @entity33 , who will be heading up the @entity34 at the @entity35 in @entity36 , and @entity37 , who is launching @entity38			1

according to @entity51 , the publisher of restaurant - industry newsletter @entity52 , the number of openings is without precedent in recent years			2
he told the @entity55 : ' there are usually quite a few launches in september , as restaurateurs traditionally hold off until people return from their holidays and @entity61 begins – but this year it ’s a step beyond			0
we ’re not just talking chain openings either – you are seeing a growth in both fine dining and casual restaurants , too			2
' chef @entity33 is opening up a new venture in @entity36 , one of a number of top names opening eateries in what industry experts are calling an ' unprecedented ' boom in new ventures two demographics in particular are driving the resurgence , according to @entity51			1
' first you have the increasingly important 25 to 34 - year - olds , who consider eating out a replacement hobby , and spend a large proportion of their disposable income on eating in informal places in @entity36 and east @entity10			1
then you have wealthy businessmen from @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 who are driving the high - end boom in places like @entity92 ’s			2
' the level of growth underlines the capital 's disconnection from the rest of @entity99 ’s service economy , according to @entity100 , restaurants editor at @entity102 magazine			1
he said : ' @entity10 is the real focus			1
the economy in the capital has remained buoyant throughout the recession and consumer confidence with it – that is only increasing , too			2
@entity10 is now the great testing ground for new eating concepts			1
' other experts say central @entity10 is highly attractive for overseas investors , especially from the @entity113 and @entity88 , who see it as a safe haven with lots of high - spending consumers			1
some restaurateurs , however , complain that the growth is unsustainable because of a lack of staff			2
@entity123 , head chef at @entity124 in @entity10 ’s @entity125 , said many workers do n't see the industry as able to provide a viable long - term career			1

' @entity3 , though , has no such worries			0
speaking of @entity7 's allure , he said : ' in @entity10 right now we ’re spoilt with the range and sheer number of phenomenal restaurants available , so it ’s amazing to see the response today when bookings opened			1

as a partner in @entity3 's latest food establishment in @entity175 , just south of the @entity176 , he is no doubt one of the biggest draws for budding diners hoping to grab a table at their place			0
artists impressions of the café show an attic feel with factory - style windows , exposed brick and furniture in neutral colours			0
designed by @entity189 - who also created the interior of @entity3 's @entity191 - the space has been influenced by the local area of @entity193 and has been described as an ' urban warehouse destination ' which will offer @entity196 - influenced food with ingredients sourced from nearby @entity198 and directly from the continent			0
