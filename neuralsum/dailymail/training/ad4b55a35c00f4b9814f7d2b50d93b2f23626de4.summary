every bride dreams of being swept off her feet on her wedding day , but one @entity5 newlywed took the phrase too literally after being sent flying off the back of a horse			1
@entity9 had spent hours having her makeup , hair , and nails perfected before going for a dream photoshoot on @entity14 , southern @entity5 , in the weeks before her ceremony			1
just as the shoot was due to end , a passing rider offered to lend mrs @entity9 her horse to take a picture on top of , and she happily accepted and went to jump into the saddle			1
but just as she settled on top of the animal it bolted , running across the beach and sending her crashing headfirst into the sand			1
however , as mrs @entity9 climbed on to the animal it bolted eventually mrs @entity9 was left face - down in the sand after being thrown off the horse , but despite being bruised went on to pose for more pictures for another half an hour @entity43 @entity42 was unaware of the accident until his wedding day a few weeks later when he was shown the video , alongside 200 guests , who were left in fits of laughter photographer @entity50 warned against posing with the animal , saying it would be unpredictable , and was soon proved right			1
he said he was worried for mrs @entity9 's safety after the accident , but when he rushed over he found her laughing the footage was caught on camera by wedding photographer @entity50 who rushed to bride 's aid - only to find her in fits of laughter			1
meanwhile the horse continued to buck and nearly knocked over its handler before the owner finally stepped in to bring the situation under control			2
@entity43 @entity42 knew nothing of the accident until a few weeks later at the wedding when his blushing bride revealed all			2
@entity50 said : ' my client decided that since you only live once , she wanted to take a photo on top of a horse			2
i 'm not much of a fan of large animals myself because of the unpredictability of them , but i agreed to take the photo if she wanted			0
dumped : mrs @entity9 lays face - down in the sand on @entity14 , @entity5 , with a shoe sitting to one side , after being thrown from a horse while posing for pre-wedding pictures shaken : wedding photographer mr @entity50 said he worried that mrs @entity9 was seriously injured after the accident last month , but when he ran over was relived to find her laughing despite taking a tumble into the sand mrs @entity9 was left with only a few minor bruises , and was even able to finish the shoot ' everyone thought it was very funny as soon as we knew she was ok			1
it was the subject of many laughs on the wedding day			0
' i think it scared her as it was happening but when we got to her she was already laughing			0
she was such a good sport that she posed for another half an hour even though she was a bit bruised			0
' the groom was shown the video on the wedding day and i watched the expression on his face			2
he was pretty shocked but he knew that she was ok and he did see the funny side			0
' the video was shown at the evening party to around 200 people , and others have since watched it on the internet			0
' the wedding photographer who captured the unforgettable moment was @entity50			0
bad idea : mrs @entity9 is pictured hitching up her dress before attempting to climb on to the horse which suddenly made a run for it moments from disaster : all still appears calm as mrs @entity9 takes the saddle on top of the unruly animal , but moments later it bolted @entity130 : mrs @entity9 appears to be laughing , or screaming , or a mixture of both as she disappears off camera on top of the horse there she goes : mrs @entity9 holds on in vain as the frightened horse disappears off camera before dumping her on to the beach @entity50 , who has been a professional wedding photographer for three years , added : ' the horse owner did n't stick around for very long after the bride fell off			1
i 've had a couple of funny things happen on shoots before but none who has had their life in danger			0
' this was a really easy - going wedding day			2
it went really smooth and the weather was great			0
' the happy couple have now put the horsing around behind them and are enjoying a honeymoon in @entity157			0
how it should have looked : mrs @entity9 did eventually get a picture with the horse , though decided not to ride it this time around stunning : despite the accident mrs @entity9 carried on with the shoot , including this shot , which she showed to her husband on their big day - along with the video of the horse			1

bride - to - be @entity9 was posing for pre-wedding pictures for her husband on beach in southern @entity5
was about to finish when passer - by offered their horse for a snap , which @entity9 accepted and tried to jump on to
@entity179 bolted , throwing her face - first into the sand ahead of big day - but *luckily* she only suffered minor bruises
