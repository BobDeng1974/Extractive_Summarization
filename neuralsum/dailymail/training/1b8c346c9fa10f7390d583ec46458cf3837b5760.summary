it ’s the middle of the night and i ’ve just been woken up at 3am by the feral sound of snow leopards mating			2
i ’m nowhere near the big cats ’ wild habitat found in the rugged mountain ranges of @entity7 but ensconced in the centre of a city at @entity11 ’s @entity10			0
the wildlife park is part of a global snow leopard breeding program aimed at boosting the numbers of the internationally endangered species – and judging from the roars echoing across the compound , it ’s proving successful			0
lighting up the night : roar and snore at @entity10 gives guests the chance to explore the park at night not for the squeamish : a zoo guide introduces a small spotted python snake to the group getting to stay at the zoo overnight is all part of @entity32 ’s aptly named @entity31 experience which promises unrivalled views of @entity11 and up - close animal encounters after the park ’s doors have closed to the public			1
carefully watching where we were going , we make our way through the huge compound , spotting giraffes and nocturnal creatures come out to see what all the noise was as we passed			0
@entity32 has some of the most impressive views of the @entity11 skyline available and when we made it to our tents we found they all overlooked the stunning harbour , lit up by stars and lights from the city			0
important message : while meeting the animals , the guides told us about the history of the zoo and its various conservation projects nighttime tour : zoo guides then took us for a late evening stroll around the grounds			1
as well as being able to see numerous nocturnal animals , we watched @entity67 mountain goats being fed lethal : @entity31 and @entity20 offers the opportunity to see big cats including tigers , lions and snow leopards at night each huge tent boasts a large double bed and a single – enough to accommodate four people – with electric blankets to complete the ‘ glamping ’ experience			1
after dumping our belongings , we found ourselves in the main tent where we were greeted with glasses of champagne , cheese and nibbles while our guides talked us through the history of the zoo			1
@entity32 is home to more than 4,000 animals , including some of the world ’s most endangered species such as @entity92 elephants and @entity94 tigers			2
glamping : guests stay in their own tents which accommodate up to four people each			2
@entity31 and @entity20 has a maximum capacity of 44 people per night first rays of light : after a good night 's sleep in some very cozy beds , it was time to watch the sun come up the guides are rightly proud of the not - for - profit zoo 's conservation efforts and they talk us through various projects including the @entity112 app which allows users to report incidents of illegal animal trade			1
the @entity31 & @entity20 experience attracts a wide variety of guests ; as well as our group , there were couples , whole families and grandparents with their grandchildren			1
after a brief introduction , it was soon time for our first animal encounter and the guides brought in a range of blue tongue lizards , bearded dragons and a small spotted python snake			2
beautiful view to wake up to : all the tents look over the harbour towards the city centre viewing point : we quickly grabbed some breakfast before taking in the view of @entity11 at sunrise best way to start the day : the city of @entity11 sparkled as the sun comes up over the harbour while still clutching our wine glasses or cheese in one hand , we were each allowed to stroke the fascinating ( and slightly terrifying ) creatures			0
one member of our group , @entity153 , expressed her love of snakes until the guide , who had the python carefully wrapped around her arm , started detailing how they can kill their prey by strangling them causing everyone nearby to take a few steps back			2
having never been that fond of reptiles , i was more than happy to move on to the next part of the stay , a night - time tour around the zoo			1
on the prowl : after breakfast , it 's back to the enclosures for the big cats , which no longer look sleepy ready for his close - up : we got to see the tigers before the park opens to the general public - meaning we had perfect , unobstructed views of the magnificent animals rare sighting : we also made a quick visit to see the zoo 's male snow leopard @entity187 who briefly shared his enclosure with his 11 - year - old mate @entity190 the night before carrying our torches with red filters so they would n’t hurt animals ’ eyes , we went to visit the big cat enclosures where we got to see one of the zoo ’s budding romances first - hand – seven - year - old male snow leopard @entity187 and his 11 - year - old mate @entity190			1
while the couple were n’t up to any shenanigans while we were there , just to see them both in the same enclosure is a rare sight as they are only put together at night at specific times so they can breed			2
@entity190 has already has two cubs with another male in 2005 but has yet to reproduce any offspring with @entity187			0
we then headed off for a delicious buffet dinner washed down with a bit more wine before heading to feed the @entity67 goats , a species so gentle they manage to scare themselves			0
we then went on another tour of the park - this time in the daylight			2
along the way we saw some stunning birds , including this pelican feeding time : zoo keepers throw food to some of the zoo 's elephant inhabitants keepers even had to start feeding them at night as they would be too scared to venture off their rock enclosure to the ground and birds would eat all their food			1
as it started approaching 11pm , it was time to head back to our tents where we had hot chocolates and desserts before tucking up in our pre-heated beds			0
the tents are airy and spacious and you drift off to sleep to the sounds of birds , squawks and roars			0
but as magical as the night had been , the real gem of @entity31 & @entity20 is the morning when you wake to see the sun rise over @entity11 and turn all the skyscrapers a bright gold			1
hungry : one of the zoo keepers introduced the group to three of the zoo 's giraffes as she fed them the first meal of their day soaking up the sun : @entity265 enjoy their breakfast and relax in the sunshine before the park opens there ’s then time for a quick shower ( with hot water ) before going for a daylight tour of the zoo before it opens to the masses			1
i quickly queried our guide over the sounds that had woken us up in the night and was told it was most likely the snow leopards we had met the night before enjoying their alone time			0
our first stop was the giraffe enclosure where we were each given a handful of carrots to feed them which generally resulted in the animals slobbering all over our hands with their huge blue tongues			0
with time running short before the zoo opened , we were then whisked off for the final part of the private tour - a series of close - up encounters with furry animals			1
first up were some energetic feathertail gliders – the world ’s smallest gliding possums which are around the size of a field mouse and move just as quickly , making them quite a handful as some guests quickly realised as they tried to clamper up arm sleeves and jump on to people ’s faces			0
celebrity of the zoo : we even got to meet @entity310 - the same koala who greeted the @entity313 and @entity314 on their visit friends in high places : @entity313 and prince @entity318 met @entity310 ( pictured left ) on their visit to the zoo in april 2014 strong aroma : once you get up close to a koala , the smell of eucalyptus becomes quite overpowering we then met the current celebrity of the zoo – a koala named @entity310 who greeted the @entity313 and @entity314 on their visit to @entity32			1
while we were n’t allowed to stroke him like @entity334 , we could get close enough to smell his pungent aroma and the eucalyptus leaves he munches on all day long			0
after meeting a few more furry friends , it was time for the zoo to open and our private tour came to end			0
but all @entity31 guests are then free to spend the rest of the day exploring the remainder of the zoo , meeting the other animals and seeing the best view @entity11 has to offer in the daylight .			1

up to 44 guests a night can camp - or rather ' glamp ' - at the zoo overnight
@entity31 & @entity20 offers guests the chance to explore the grounds by night
experienced guides reveal the history of the zoo which opened in 1916
guests get up - close encounters with some of the zoo 's *residents* - including snakes , lizards , tigers and one famous koala
