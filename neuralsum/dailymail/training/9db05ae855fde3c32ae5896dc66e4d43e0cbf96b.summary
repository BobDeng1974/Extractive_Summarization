by @entity0 vast glaciers in @entity2 seem to be locked in an irreversible thaw linked to global warming that may push up sea levels for centuries , according to scientists			1
in a few hundred years they say the irreversible melt that has already started could eventually add four to 12 feet ( 1.2 to 3.7 metres ) to current sea levels			1
a @entity12 study looking at 40 years of ground , airplane and satellite data of what researchers call ' the weak underbelly of @entity2 ' shows the melt is happening faster than scientists had predicted , crossing a critical threshold that has begun a domino - like process			1
six glaciers , eaten away from below by a warming of sea waters around the frozen continent , were flowing fast into the @entity32 , according to the report based on data from 1992 to 2011 evidence shows ' a large sector of the @entity25 ice sheet has gone into a state of irreversible retreat ' , says lead author @entity40 of the @entity41 , and @entity12 's @entity42 in @entity43 , @entity44			1
the coastal ends of the glaciers rest on bedrock below sea level , holding back a vast weight of ice and making them vulnerable to melt , he said			1
' it does seem to be happening quickly , ' says @entity54 glaciologist @entity53 , lead author of a separate study into the same phenomenon			0
' we really are witnessing the beginning stages			0
' it 's likely because of man - made global warming and the ozone hole which have changed the @entity25 winds and warmed the water that eats away at the feet of the ice , researchers said at a @entity12 news conference monday			1
' the system is in sort of a chain reaction that is unstoppable , ' continued @entity40			2
' every process in this reaction is feeding the next one			2
it 's passed the point of no return			1
' @entity40 and other scientists said the ' grounding line ' which could be considered a dam that stops glacier retreat has essentially been breached			0
another way to think of it is like wine flowing from a horizontal uncorked bottle , they said			0
the only thing that could stop the retreat in this low - altitude region is a mountain or hill			2
but ice - penetrating radars showed there are no mountain ranges entombed under the ice that could halt the flow			2
despite ice coverage increasing in some areas , @entity12 claims that in a few hundred years the irreversible melt that has already started from the @entity32 sector of the @entity2 ice sheet , pictured , has now ' passed the @entity74 ' and could eventually add four to 12 feet ( 1.2 to 3.7 metres ) to current sea levels scientists say curbing carbon emissions wo n't be able to stop the collapse of these glaciers , but may slow the process and at least prevent the them from melting at their current speed this part of @entity2 would be a major contributor to sea level rise in coming decades and centuries since the glaciers hold enough ice to raise sea levels by more than four feet ( 1.2 metres )			1
the fastest retreat from 1992 to 2011 was 21 to 23 miles ( 34 to 37 kilometres ) over the period in the @entity117 / @entity116 glacier			0
reducing carbon emissions from fossil fuels to slow climate change could slow the speed of the problem , @entity40 said , although it will probably not completely halt the melting			1
cuts in greenhouse gas emissions , part of efforts to rein in global warming , could at least slow the slide of the @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity117 and @entity116 glaciers			1
' we do think this is related to climate warming , ' @entity40 added			0
the scientists believed that a build - up of man - made greenhouse gases in the atmosphere was affecting wind patterns around @entity2 , driving warmer waters towards the continent			0
almost 200 nations have agreed to work out a @entity148 pact by the end of 2015 to combat global warming , which the @entity148 @entity151 ( @entity151 ) says will cause more floods , droughts , heat waves and higher seas			0
although the @entity156 ( shown shrinking over the last decade ) is only a fraction of the whole @entity158 , the region contains enough ice to raise global sea levels by four feet ( 1.2 meters ) @entity40 looked at six glaciers in the region with special concentration on the @entity131 , about the size of @entity164 and @entity165 combined			1
@entity131 is so connected to the other glaciers that it helps trigger loss elsewhere , said @entity53 , whose study was released in the journal @entity171			0
@entity53 's study used computer simulations and he concluded ' the early - stage collapse has begun			0
' @entity40 , who used data that showed a speed up of melt since the 1990s , said the word ' collapse ' may imply too fast a loss - it would be more the start of a slow - motion collapse and ' we ca n't stop it			1
' a separate study of the @entity131 by the @entity54 in the journal @entity171 also said it may have begun an unstoppable collapse that could last from 200 to 1,000 years			2
a disappearance of the @entity131 alone would raise world sea levels by 1.96 feet ( 60 centimetres ) but the ' glacier also acts as a linchpin on the rest of the ice sheet , which contains enough ice to cause another three to four metres ( 10 to 13 feet ) of sea level rise , ' it said			1
scientists say the early stages of collapse have already begun and there 's nothing we can do to stop it			2
on the left here can be seen the elevation of the region , while on the right the various glaciers that will be affected by the melting of the @entity32 region several outside experts in @entity2 added their concern			2
' it 's bad news			0
it 's a game changer , ' said @entity217 , lead scientist at the @entity218			0
' we thought we had a while to wait and see			0
we 've started down a process that we always said was the biggest worry and biggest risk from @entity2			0
' the @entity40 study sees eventually 4 feet ( 1.2 metres ) of sea level rise from the melt			1
but it could trigger neighboring ice sheet loss that could mean a total of 10 to 12 feet ( 3.0 to 3.7 metres ) of sea level rise , @entity53 's study showed			1
the findings may also mean that scenarios by the @entity151 for sea level rise are too low			0
the @entity151 said last year that sea levels are likely to rise by between 10 and 32 inches ( 26 and 82 centimetres ) by the late 21st century , after a rise of just seven inches ( 19 centimetres ) since 1900			1
' the major ice sheets of this planet will have a larger and larger role in sea level rise in the decades ahead , ' said @entity240 , professor of geosciences at @entity242 , who was not involved in the study			2
last week , another study also suggested a part of the far bigger ice sheet in @entity247 may also be more vulnerable than expected to thaw			1
the @entity151 says it is at least 95 percent probable that warming is caused by human activities , led by the burning of fossil fuels			0
meanwhile , on may 6 , the @entity253 administration issued a study saying that warming ' once considered an issue for a distant future has moved firmly into the present			0
' and the @entity151 said in march there were signs of irreversible changes to tropical coral reefs and to the @entity262 .			0

new studies say the melting of the @entity25 ice sheet is unstoppable
parts will completely melt in a few centuries and *drastically* raise sea levels
combined with other glaciers it could add four feet to @entity275 's oceans
it is occuring faster than predicted and has ' passed the @entity74 '
curbing carbon emissions wo n't stop it but could slow the process
the data was *compiled* from 40 years of ground , air and satellite data
