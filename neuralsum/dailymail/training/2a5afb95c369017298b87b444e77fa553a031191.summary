off target : failed bank boss sir @entity2 a damning report into how @entity4 was brought to its knees by a £ 50billion gamble triggered outrage yesterday after former boss sir @entity2 escaped any punishment			1
the long - awaited 450 - page report into the bank ’s cataclysmic collapse lays bare a catalogue of management incompetence , regulatory failings and disastrous takeover deals which led to the bank ’s implosion in 2008			2
‘ @entity2 ’ and his colleagues were allowed to run riot because of a ‘ light touch ’ regulatory regime championed by @entity22 ministers including current shadow chancellor @entity23 , found the report by the @entity25			1
the bank was brought to its knees by ‘ multiple poor decisions ’ and a huge gamble when @entity4 – as part of a consortium – bought @entity34 bank @entity33 for £ 50billion in 2007			1
despite his pivotal role in the downfall of @entity4 , sir @entity2 , 53 , continues to enjoy his gold - plated lifestyle and his knighthood , funded by a £ 342,500 a year pension			1
he has not been penalised or prosecuted in any way , despite steering the bank to the brink of collapse			2
it only survived because of a £ 45billion bailout by the taxpayer , who still own 83 per cent of the bank			2
there are fears they may never get all their money back			0
in the regulator ’s report : politicians , including @entity23 and the former prime minister @entity56 , are lambasted for urging the regulator to leave @entity4 and other banks alone			1
it says there was political pressures for a ‘ light - touch regulatory regime ' , despite the banking industry having such a vital role in society and the economy ; it is revealed that a year before @entity4 ’s collapse in october 2008 , just ‘ 4.5 people ’ at the @entity25 were in charge of regulating the bank , which the regulator now admits was ‘ severely deficient ’ ; it also says that ‘ sir @entity2 ’s ‘ robust and assertive ’ management style was flagged as a potential risk as early as 2003 ; there are just 13 mentions of sir @entity2 ’s name in the report , although the @entity25 insisted yesterday his lawyers had not significantly changed its findings after being given the right to examine them before publication ; it is revealed that at one point , there was just one person responsible for the regulation of @entity4 ’s and @entity91 ’ investment banking activities , a stance blamed on @entity22 ’s political appetite for minimal regulation ; it says that when @entity4 bought the @entity34 bank , @entity33 , its research into the deal in 2007 which proved to be disastrous amounted to just ‘ two lever arch folders and a cd ’ ; sir @entity2 ’s affair with a colleague , which the married father - of - two tried desperately to keep private , was ‘ irrelevant to the story of @entity4 ’s failure ’ , according to the @entity25			1
sir @entity2 is unemployed , but has such a super-size pension that he never needs to work again			1
@entity108 , the leading @entity110 peer , said : ‘ @entity4 was a monster – too big to control and to fail , driven by greed and ruled by a tyrant			1
‘ reckless train and car drivers go to prison , but sir @entity2 goes to the golf course			1
’ implications : the @entity25 report alludes to sir @entity2 's infamously aggressive management style , saying his ' perceived dominance ' created a risk to add to the fury of taxpayers , the disgraced @entity125 banker also took out a £ 2.8million tax - free lump sum from his pension before he started receiving it			1
when lord @entity131 , chairman of the @entity25 , was asked by the @entity132 yesterday if he thought that it was ‘ fair ’ that sir @entity2 has escaped , he replied : ‘ no ’			1
he said : ‘ ordinary people … have a right to be absolutely furious			0
’ the report says there were a number of reasons behind the failure of @entity4 , which was a relatively small , prudently managed bank before sir @entity2 joined			1
one of the biggest problems was its ‘ over-reliance on risky short - term wholesale funding ’ , which was unsustainable when the credit crunch killed it off			0
the former chancellor , @entity145 , wrote in his recent autobiography that @entity4 was just a few hours from collapse when the government stepped in			1
@entity4 also rushed into buying @entity33 despite knowing little about it			1
it discovered problems only after it had paid the bill			0
the report says : ‘ the decision to make a bid of this scale on the basis of limited due diligence entailed a degree of risk - taking that can reasonably be criticised as a gamble			0
’ it adds : ‘ many will find this conclusion [ that no director will face sanctions ] difficult to accept			0
surely someone can and should be held responsible			0
’ it also alludes to sir @entity2 ’s infamously aggressive management style , saying his ‘ perceived dominance ’ created a risk			1
business secretary @entity168 said he was taking legal advice to see if there is any way sir @entity2 and other ex-directors could be penalised , such as being disqualified from company directorships			1
@entity174 , of the @entity175 , which represents individual shareholders , said : ‘ the legal framework is totally inadequate			0
directors can be totally incompetent and yet still escape any penalty			0
‘ the shareholders have seen their savings destroyed			0
’ @entity4 shares were worth more than £ 6 in 2007 compared to 20.55p now			1
senior @entity22 politicians including shadow chancellor @entity23 were yesterday blamed for their role in the near - collapse of @entity4			2
the @entity25 report reveals how it had come under ‘ sustained ’ political pressure from the previous government to spare the @entity188 from regulation in the run - up to the banking crisis			2
the body took the extraordinary step of naming three @entity22 politicians – former prime ministers @entity56 and @entity196 as well as mr @entity23			0
in the frame : the body took the extraordinary step of naming former @entity22 politicians @entity196 ( right ) and @entity23 in its report , as well as @entity56 the @entity25 highlighted a series of speeches and comments by the trio warning that any attempt to tighten the rules would have prompted complaints of ‘ heavy - handedness ’			0
the watchdog concluded that deficiencies in management , governance and culture were responsible for dragging @entity4 to the brink of collapse in 2008			2
the @entity25 admitted that its own supervision was ‘ flawed ’ , but it said it had come under sustained pressure to protect the @entity188 ’s status as a financial powerhouse			0
revelations : the report also cited how the then @entity25 chairman wrote to mr @entity56 ( pictured ) the report is an indictment of @entity22 ’s role in the crisis			0
mr @entity196 and right - hand man mr @entity23 have been criticised for taking responsibility for bank regulation from the @entity230 and handing it to the @entity25 in 1997			0
the report points to a speech made in 2006 by mr @entity23 when he was treasury secretary in which he said ‘ nothing should be done to put at risk a light - touch , risk - based regulatory regime ’			1
the @entity25 said that , in this context , it was ‘ almost certain ’ the @entity25 would have been accused of pursuing a ‘ heavy - handed , gold - plating approach which would harm @entity242 ’s competitiveness ’ if it had argued for the tighter banking rules that were put in place after the crisis			0
the report adds that it responded to the pressure by reassuring @entity22 politicians that it only employed a handful of staff to supervise major banks			0
it goes on to cite how then @entity25 chairman sir @entity252 wrote to mr @entity56 assuring him that the @entity25 ‘ applied to the supervision of its largest banks only a fraction of the resource applied by @entity258 regulators to banks of equivalent size and importance ’			0
prime minister @entity262 said yesterday that the report was evidence that ‘ @entity22 were to blame for the appalling regulation of @entity4 ’			2
@entity267 deputy chairman @entity266 said : ‘ the report exposes how @entity22 share the blame for the regulatory failures that led to the biggest bank bailout in history			2
‘ you would n’t bring back @entity2 to sort out the banks , so why would you bring back @entity23 to sort out the economy ? ’			2

@entity4 was brought to its knees by ' multiple poor decisions '
@entity2 and his colleagues were allowed to run riot because of a ' light touch ' regulatory regime
