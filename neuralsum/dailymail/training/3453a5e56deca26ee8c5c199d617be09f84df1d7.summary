by @entity0 trained sharpshooters may soon be a thing of the past after a gun that aims itself was unveiled during last week ’s @entity5 in @entity6			1
@entity7 , an @entity9 , @entity8 - based gun manufacturer took the wraps off a semi-automatic gun with five times the accuracy of most experienced shooters			1
the nearly - $ 10,000 500 @entity14 tags targets within a 500 - yard range and automatically shoots them - even if they 're moving as fast as 10 miles per hour , according to @entity17			1
no need for any experience : just tag the target and let the @entity21 do all the work ‘ there are some amazing expert marksmen in the world , ’ @entity7 ceo @entity23 told @entity24			1
‘ but what this does is , it lets you pick up this gun and go shoot right to the same level of those expert marksmen			2
’ mr @entity23 also boasted the gun is ‘ beyond what the human capacity is for being able to factor ’ the exact spot to hit moving targets and fire off a shot			2
the @entity21 is not the first self - aiming gun built by the company , nor is it the longest range firearm – but it is the only semi-automatic self - aiming firearm known to exist			2
@entity7 also makes a self - aiming rifle with a range of up to 1,200 yards and a self - aiming handgun , @entity45 noted			2
those guns were first rolled out last year , according to @entity17			0
no need for sharpshooters : the self - aiming semi-automatic rifle does all the heavy lifting all of the firearms use the company ’s @entity56 system – which tracks @entity58 , drop , magnus effect , spindrift , coriolis effect , direction , cant , inclination , pressure , temperature , humidity , muzzle velocity , barrel length and twist , lock time , ballistic coefficient , and drag coefficient , according to @entity45			0
wind direction and speed are also tracked , but those must be input manually , the site noted			0
even more amazingly , the @entity80 allows users to connect to a smartphone running the @entity7 app and record up to an hour of video that can be stored in the gun ’s on - board storage , according to @entity24			0
people can pre-order the guns through the company ’s website , but must pass more than a background check – they must also be willing to be beta testers of sorts			1
the company wants a continuous stream of data about the devices to help make them even more accurate			0
the firm is also working on developing a model for the military and licenses technology to @entity103 , according to @entity17			0
about 40 people have so far qualified , according to @entity17			0
guns should start shipping in october .			1

the 500 @entity14 *retails* for almost $ 10,000
it is in *limited* beta testing for *buyers* who qualify
units should start shipping in october
