by @entity0 do you always take the lift rather than climb that flight of stairs ? or struggle to eat any fruit or veg ? if so , you could be dramatically increasing your risk of cancer - and using the quiz below , you will be able to gauge by how much			1
there is strong scientific evidence to suggest that lifestyle is a big factor when it comes to developing cancer			2
liver cancer rose substantially over the past decade - by 70 per cent among men and 60 per cent among women between 2003 and 2012 , according to new figures by the @entity36 ( @entity36 )			1
rates of malignant melanoma , the most dangerous form of skin cancer , have risen by 78 per cent among men and 48 per cent among women over the same period			2
the main causes of liver cancer are tobacco , infections with hepatitis b and @entity47 , and excess alcohol consumption			0
but being physically active , maintaining a healthy weight and eating a diet rich in plant foods , such as cereals , pulses , fruit and vegetables , have all been proven to cut the risk of developing cancer , scientists at @entity50 say			1
@entity60 , the organisation ’s @entity61 at the charity , said many people still do n’t realise that the way that they live – from what they have for breakfast to how active they are – could help save them from developing the devastating disease			0
she added that about 89,000 cases of cancer could be avoided if we ate a healthy diet that includes a variety of fruit and vegetables , wholegrains and pulses , were as physically active as we could be and maintained a healthy weight			1
this includes 20,100 bowel cancer cases , 21,000 breast cancer cases and 8,300 prostate cancer cases			1
now the charity has developed a short quiz that can show you whether your lifestyle is helping protect you from cancer - or increasing your risk			1
it asks about your job , your shopping habits , what you eat and other lifestyle choices , before estimating whether you need to make any changes to help reduce your risk of the disease - and advising what these should be			0
ms @entity60 added : ' even small changes to lifestyles can make a big difference			0
' it can be confusing knowing what to do to avoid developing cancer , but our research has shown that there are some clear choices people can make to help protect themselves against the disease			0
' take the two tests here ... @entity109 the @entity50 ’s top recommendations for cancer prevention are : be a healthy weight – be as lean as possible without becoming underweight physical activity – be active for at least 30 minutes a day plant foods – eat a variety of vegetables , fruits , wholegrains and pulses energy density – avoid sugary drinks and limit consumption of energy - dense foods ( particularly processed foods that are high in fat , low in fibre , or high in sugar ) meat – to reduce your cancer risk , eat no more than 500g ( cooked weight ) per week of red meat , like beef , pork and lamb , and avoid processed meats such as ham , bacon , salami , hot dogs and some sausages			1
as a rough guide 500g of cooked red meat is the same as 700 to 750g of raw red meat			0
alcohol – limit alcoholic drinks to two for men and one for women a day @entity150 – @entity150 is linked to 14 per cent of stomach cancer cases in the @entity152			2
our daily intake of salt should be less than 6g ( 2.4g sodium ) – we actually need much less than this			0
supplements – do n’t rely on supplements to protect against cancer breastfeeding – best for mothers to breastfeed exclusively for up to six months and then add other liquids and foods cancer survivors – those who have survived cancer should follow these recommendations for cancer prevention where possible .			0

figures out today show a steep rise in rates of lifestyle - linked cancers
89,000 cases of cancer could be avoided if we were healthier
this includes eating a diet that includes a variety of fruit and vegetables
plus being as physically active as possible and a healthy weight
