the @entity5 leader said anti-english sentiment in @entity7 was now the ' biggest ' form of racism in the @entity10			1
@entity11 said mr @entity2 had made the problem worse and said it was wrong that @entity5 is called racist			1
' @entity26 he @entity1 are openly racist			0
the anti-english hostility and the kind of language that is used about and towards @entity32 people is totally extraordinary			0
' if my supporters behaved in the way that some of those pro-independence supporters behaved in the referendum i 'd have been painted out to be the worst person that had been seen for 70 years in @entity10 politics			0
' asked if being anti-english was the same as being racist , mr @entity0 said : ' when i say that i do n't think we should have an open door to @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 i 'm accused of being racist and yet when it 's the @entity7 being rude about the @entity32 you do n't think it is			1
' the fact is @entity5 is a non-racist non-sectarian political party and we 've got more members of black and ethnic minority standing for us than the @entity52 or the @entity53			2
we 're an all embracing party			0
' mr @entity0 addressed supporters at the @entity55 , in @entity19 , as he stepped up his election push in the north of @entity32 @entity0 has said he is ' astonished ' by how little clothing women in @entity59 wear on a night out			2
the @entity5 leader said it showed that people in the @entity63 are ' particularly tough '			1
during a visit to @entity19 , he said : ' the last time i went out in @entity59 was about 18 months ago and i think it was february or march and i think it was completely astonished to see how little clothing people wear in this part of the world			0
' there were girls with platform shoes like that , dresses here , blokes in t - shirts and i can only conclude that although we are all from the same country you are particularly tough up here			0
' mr @entity0 accused the former @entity7 first minister of not doing enough to counter the problem			1
he said : ' i think the one i blame is @entity2			0
when i was attacked by a group of thugs in the street in @entity86 with the most extraordinary anti-english sentiments being shouted , when @entity2 was asked whether he condemned that ‎ behaviour he did n't			0
' i think it is ironic that all the talk about extremism within @entity10 politics is pointed towards @entity5 when there are others who are far more guilty			2
' asked if @entity95 was also to blame , mr @entity0 added : ' she has n't done anything to stop it , but i have n't heard her say anything to encourage it			1
‎ ' but @entity1 msp @entity98 hit back at the @entity5 leader 's ' politics of fear and intolerance '			1
he said : ' these disgraceful comments - which are n't just offensive to the @entity1 , but to the majority of people in @entity7 on current polls - show exactly why the people of @entity7 reject @entity5			1
' @entity0 's politics of fear and intolerance have been exposed in this campaign , and he has still not apologised for @entity112 mep comparing me to a convicted terrorist merely because i am a @entity115			2
' the @entity1 have been clear that we will be a positive voice for people across the @entity10 - and with progressive policies such as ending austerity to invest in public services and our @entity122 , we can bring real change north and south of the border			0
' all @entity5 have to offer is nasty rhetoric			2
' mr @entity0 said both @entity95 and mr @entity2 had failed to act to quell resentment between the @entity32 and @entity7 mr @entity0 also dismissed a claim from @entity129 's shadow business secretary @entity128 that @entity5 is infected with the ' virus of racism '			1
he said mr @entity128 , who he labelled ' the high priest of the liberal metropolitan elite ' , had made the comment because @entity129 is ' running scared ' of @entity5			1
@entity19 , which has been held by @entity129 since it was formed in 1974 , is @entity5 's main target seat in the @entity63 at the general election in 2010 , @entity5 took just seven per cent of the vote and @entity129 's @entity138 retained the seat with a 5,509 majority			1
he replaced @entity141 as the mp in a by - election in 2004 after the @entity129 grandee stood down to become a @entity146 commissioner			2
mr @entity0 's hopes for electoral victory in @entity19 come after the town elected a man dressed as a monkey as its mayor in 2002			0
@entity153 stood as ' @entity154 ' , @entity156 's mascot , as a publicity stunt with the slogan , ' free bananas for schoolchildren '			0
he was re-elected in 2005 and 2009 before voters in the town backed a referendum to scrap the paid post in 2012			0
