by @entity0 when our robot overlords come to power , they may not look exactly how you imagined			2
if @entity7 has its way , they could look more like unstoppable hopping kangaroos rather than terminator - style machines			0
for the past two years , the @entity12 group has been secretly working emulating the jumping behaviour of the kangaroo in robot form			0
@entity24 , the robot is controlled by gestures and can efficiently recover energy from one jump to help it make the next			1
it does this by using an elastic spring , which partially ‘ charges ’ the legs on landing , according to a report by @entity33 in @entity34			0
for the past two years , the @entity12 group @entity7 has been secretly working emulating the jumping behaviour of the kangaroo in robot form before the initial jump , the elastic tendon is pneumatically pre-tensioned and the @entity24 shifts its centre of gravity forwards			1
when a certain angle is reached , the pneumatic cylinders are activated and the energy from the tendon is released			0
this causes the kangaroo to take off and as it does , it pulls its legs forward creating torque at the hip			0
during landing , the tendon is tensed again to convert the kinetic energy of the previous jump to potential energy for the next jump			1
this is similar to the technique used by kangaroos who use their tendons like elastic springs to bound from one area to another			1
as well as the elastic spring , the company ’s @entity68 also installed a small storage tank to provide high pressure air for the pneumatic muscles to power the movement of the robot			2
‘ with the @entity24 we have precisely reproduced the most characteristic features of natural kangaroos : recuperating and storing energy , and then releasing it once more in the next bound , ’ @entity7 ’s dr @entity75 said			1
the entire robotic animal weighs just 15 lb ( 7kg ) and stands 3ft 3inches ( 1m ) , but it can jump 1ft 3inches ( 40cm ) vertically and 2ft 7 inch ( 0.8 metres ) horizontally			0
before the initial jump , the elastic tendon is pneumatically pre-tensioned and the @entity24 shifts its centre of gravity forwards			1
the @entity85 ( right ) partially ‘ charges ’ the legs on landing			0
its movement is based on that of a real kangaroo ( left ) which uses its tendons like elastic springs to bound from one area to another a combination of drives , control technology and the mobile energy supply help power the @entity24 when a certain angle is reached , the pneumatic cylinders are activated and the energy from the tendon is released			1
this causes the kangaroo to take off and as it does , it pulls its legs forward creating torque at the hip			0
during landing , the tendon is tensed again to convert the kinetic energy of the previous jump to potential energy for the next jump			2
@entity7 said that it has no plans to release robotic kangaroos , but hopes its latest creation will help demonstrate how energy from movement can be recovered more effectively			2
before the initial jump , the elastic tendon is pneumatically pre-tensioned and the @entity24 shifts its centre of gravity forwards during landing , the tendon is tensed again to convert the kinetic energy of the previous jump to potential energy for the next jump			1

@entity24 , the robot is controlled by hand gestures
it can efficiently recover energy from one jump to help it make the next
this is similar to kangaroos who use their tendons like elastic springs
the robot could help improve industrial automation systems that manufacture products such as cars and computers
