an amateur photographer on holiday in @entity2 captured this breathtaking picture of the moment an enormous ice bridge ruptured and plunged into a lake below			1
@entity6 was visiting the @entity7 in @entity2 's @entity9 region and had his camera trained on the ice bridge at the opportune moment			1
another holidaymaker had a camcorder to capture a video of the dramatic collapse			2
collapse : @entity6 captured this breathtaking image of an ice bridge collapsing at the southern tip of the @entity7 in @entity9 , @entity2 , last month splash : the collapse sent a huge wave surging through the waters of @entity25 , which the bridge spanned the dramatic collapse sends thousands of tons of ice plummeting into the waters , sending a massive wave surging through the lake below			1
at nearly 20 miles long , the @entity7 is one of the largest in @entity9 , a region at @entity33 's chilly southern tip. extending down from the @entity36 , high in the @entity37 , the glacier 's tip periodically cuts off @entity25 's major southern arm , which is known as @entity39 , according to @entity41 's @entity40			1
this tip slices right across a narrow section of the lake , meeting the opposite shoreline to form a natural dam which prevents lake water circulating from one side to the other			2
@entity41 scientist @entity51 told @entity52 : ' this glacier is somewhat unique in that its path takes it across an arm of a large lake			2
' most glaciers do n't have such trajectories , so bridging and tunnelling , at least at this scale , is rather rare			0
' this is how the icy span looked moments before the collapse : the tip of the glacier periodically grows to dam the waters of @entity25 , until huge pressures blow it in a cataclysmic display of natural power dr @entity51 curates the @entity74 , which featured mr @entity6 's photo , taken on january 19 , at the height of the southern hemisphere 's summer			1
the photographer told the site : ' i was one of perhaps 20 privileged people in @entity83 this midsummer day to witness the spectacle			0
' but the rupture , although dramatic , was just relatively minor compared to how big they can become			0
because of the natural ice dam , meltwater raises @entity39 by as much as 30m above the level of the water in @entity25			0
natural dam : the @entity7 extends from the @entity93 high in the @entity37 into the waters of @entity25 where every few years it grows to cut one portion of the lake from the rest every four or five years , the immense pressure created by these unequal water levels smashes through the ice tongue in a cataclysmic display of the power of nature			1
the last time this happened was in march last year			0
the latest burst , as pictured by mr @entity6 , was a result of the collapse of the ice bridge lest over from that burst , which had hollowed out an enormous hole beneath it			0
the repeated ruptures have made the glacier and lake a major tourist attraction in the region , @entity41 said .			0

dramatic collapse seen by tourists at @entity2 's @entity7
the @entity9 glacier 's southern tip extends into @entity25
every few years it splits the lake , until pressure leads to a dramatic burst
