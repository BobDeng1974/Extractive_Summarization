pressure : thrown off guard by a heckler in @entity4 who accused him of slashing benefits , mr @entity1 said last week the ' reality is this country is not cutting welfare ' @entity10 's austerity programme ’ was under pressure last night as a fierce war of words broke out over major welfare curbs and tax cuts for the well - off that take effect over the next week			1
the @entity19 and @entity20 feuding came after @entity21 @entity1 blurted out that he had given up trying to cut the benefits bill			1
he said he is simply ‘ managing ’ the ever - rising increase in handouts – and was forced to deny his new ‘ universal ’ benefit is in turmoil			1
his comments were in stark contrast to remarks by his own minister for the @entity32 , @entity33 , who told @entity35 she is determined to stop widespread abuse of the £ 13 billion - a - year disability benefit claimed by three million			1
and @entity38 came under fire over a highly - provocative leaflet attacking the cut in the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p from april 6			1
the @entity19 leaflet , designed to look like a lottery flyer , states : ‘ £ 100,000 win for everyone earning £ 1 million			1
’ in fact , people who earn £ 1 million , will be £ 42,500 better off per year			0
a @entity20 official said : ‘ @entity19 ’s claim is a lie and the crude politics of envy			1
cutting the top rate means more people work hard and pay more in tax overall , so the government has more money , not less , to spend on services			2
’ the clashes mark long - awaited changes in taxes and benefits that start tomorrow			1
they include the so - called ‘ bedroom tax ’ , a cut in benefits to people in under - occupied homes ; the so - called ‘ granny tax ’ , abolishing special tax breaks for over 65s ; new checks to stop 500,000 people claiming up to £ 120 a week in @entity76 and a one per cent cap on benefit rises			1
thrown off his guard by a heckler in @entity4 who accused him of slashing benefits , mr @entity1 said last week the ‘ reality is this country is not cutting welfare			2
all those on cash benefits will still see cash increases in every year of this @entity88 ’			2
criticism : @entity38 came under fire over a highly - provocative leaflet attacking the cut in the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p from april 6 mr @entity1 ’s @entity1 ’s indiscreet comments exposed his private fury that his ‘ war on welfare ’ has been vetoed by deputy prime minister @entity98			1
but it makes a mockery of repeated claims by mr @entity10 and mr @entity1 himself that they want to cut welfare			2
privately , mr @entity1 is still seething that three big welfare cuts put forward by him – freezing welfare benefits , scrapping housing benefit for under 25s and axeing additional handouts for people on benefits with two children who have a third – were all ruled out by the @entity115			2
they would have saved £ 10 billion a year			0
a @entity20 source said : ‘ mr @entity1 would dearly like to go much go further in reducing welfare , but he ca n’t because of the @entity115			0
' all he has done is admit the truth : because of the @entity115 , the welfare bill will carry on rising under the @entity121			0
' he is frustrated by it as all the evidence is the public supports him			0
’ the source denied mr @entity1 was trying to play down the looming welfare benefits crackdown because claimants are about to realise their handouts have been cut – or stopped			1
there was no reference in mr @entity98 ’s @entity132 message to benefit cuts			0
minister for the @entity135 told @entity35 of her determination to force through controversial reforms to the @entity76			0
from april 8 , the benefit is to be renamed @entity139 , and claimants will be subjected to regular face - to - face checks			0
the word ‘ disability ’ has been dropped from the name of the handout as ministers say it is falsely claimed by large numbers of people who are temporarily incapacitated and still claim it when well			0
to back up the case for reform , ministers highlighted new official figures showing that , since 2008 , nearly 900,000 people dropped their incapacity benefit claims rather than undergo a tough medical test			0
the figure amounted to more than a third of the total number of people claiming sickness - related benefits			0
ms @entity33 is determined to weed out another 500,000 people suspected of making – and winning – claims for @entity76 , many of which are paid for life on the basis of form filling .			0
