mr @entity10 says the woman was unhappy when offered a job sharing role that required her to work around 10 weeks of the year full time and was ' unworkable			1
' he alleges that at one point during his discussions with mr @entity6 about the situation , his boss told him : ' that b * * * * has had every guy in here wrapped around her fingers			1

' he said it was his suggestion that she consider the job of operations manager working in @entity81			0
mr @entity6 said she was already working part time and the new job had been conceived as a full time post			1
however , he said she told him it was possible her husband could also be made redundant and , if that happened , she might consider doing the job on a full time basis			0
he said he advised her to speak to the head of @entity81 , @entity94 as well as mr @entity10 about the ' likely redundancy situation , ' so she had all the facts			2

' ' my concern was that no consideration had been given to how the job sharers would cover each other 's leave			0

i did not bully or undermine him or isolate him in decision making			0
' he added : ' i would need to chase him for information or to deliver on an action i has assigned			0
' i would find myself having to ask questions about situations i would have expected mr @entity10 to have already asked			0
