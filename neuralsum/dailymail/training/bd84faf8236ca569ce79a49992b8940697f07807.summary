by @entity0 published : 11:06 est , 31 may 2012 updated : 12:08 est , 31 may 2012 anger : @entity3 chief fire officer @entity2 said the charges should never have been brought the families of three firemen killed in a warehouse blaze have called a chief fire officer ' hypocritical ' , ' arrogant ' and ' small minded ' after he welcomed the acquittal of three long - serving firefighters who had been charged with manslaughter over the tragedy			1
@entity2 , the head of @entity13 , claimed @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 had been ' treated like common criminals ' in the wake of the fatal fire at @entity20 in 2007			1
jurors at @entity22 yesterday cleared watch manager @entity14 , 45 , and 51 - year - old station manager @entity16 of gross negligence manslaughter after hearing six weeks of evidence about the deaths of @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29			1
watch manager @entity15 , 50 , was acquitted of the same charge on the directions of the judge part - way through the trial			2
police never found the criminals who started the fire and £ 4.7million has been spent over five years trying to pin blame for the losses on the managers who let the firemen enter the building even though all employees had already been accounted for			1
speaking after the verdicts , mr @entity2 said it was ' crystal clear ' that the case should not have been brought to court and called for an investigation into why the three men were prosecuted			1
but at a press conference in @entity3 today , relatives of mr @entity26 , mr @entity29 and mr @entity27 said they had been let down by @entity13 following the fire at a vegetable packing plant on november 2			1
the family of mr @entity28 were present but decided not to speak			2
@entity29 ’s widow @entity55 said she had been devastated by the not guilty verdicts , adding : ' why does @entity3 chief fire officer @entity2 think this case should not have gone to court ? does he not think that where the evidence is there , action should be taken ? ' is he really that arrogant and small minded to think that firefighters are above the law ? ' we are all accountable for our actions , even the police			1
no one is above the law			2
victims : ( clockwise from top left ) @entity72 , @entity26 , @entity29 and @entity28 were killed tackling the blaze in @entity20 , @entity3 , in 2007			1
their families are angry at the fire service 's reaction to the manslaughter acquittal ' we have a legal process in this country and if the police suspect a crime has been committed they are duty bound to investigate and pass their findings to the @entity85			1
' the legal process will determine whether charges should be brought , not the profession of an individual			0
the jury could not find guilt in this case			0
but if this case makes incident commanders take one extra minute to assess the situation presented on arriving at an incident then that can only be for the good			0
' a firefighter ’s life is not worth less than that of a member of the public and it most certainly is not worth a pallet of packing material			0
' mrs @entity103 , who described the fire service as a ' sleepy hollow ' , added : ' i do acknowledge that the defendants and their families have had a difficult year with this hanging over their heads but it is nothing compared to the heartache that @entity112 ( the couple ’s daughter ) and i have suffered for four and a half years			1
cleared : watch manager @entity14 and station manager @entity16 were found not guilty of manslaughter following the deaths of four firefighters killed when a roof collapsed during warehouse blaze cleared : station manager @entity16 speaks to the media flanked by @entity123 and @entity14 yesterday			1
the three men were cleared of causing the deaths of four colleagues ' i lost my husband , who i loved very much , and @entity112 lost the dad she adored			0
our heartache and loss is permanent			0
' @entity133 , the firefighter father of @entity26 , was present at the blaze that killed his son			2
in a statement read on his behalf by a police liaison officer , he said : ' as his father , and at the time a serving firefighter being present at the incident , having witnessed the horrendous scene on that night has left me with images that will stay with me forever - images so strong i have not been able to attend the court hearing			0
' the loss of @entity14 has left such a big hole in our hearts that it is impossible to mend			0
' @entity13 gave us unlimited support up until the charges were brought against three of their officers			0
after that it seemed we were on the wrong side and support dwindled down to nothing			0
' to hear the chief fire officer speak to the press saying their thoughts were with the families was very hypocritical as the only family support shown has been to the defendants ’ families			1
tragedy : firefighters @entity26 , @entity72 , @entity28 and @entity29 were killed as they tackled the blaze in @entity20 , @entity3 , in 2007 ' @entity14 loved being part of the fire service and wanted to become a full - time firefighter			1
it seems so unjust that the full - time officers he would have looked up to have let him down so badly			0
' @entity175 , the mother of @entity72 , said : ' that night will haunt me forever			0
' i never thought i would feel so let down by the fire service			2
they talk about brothers in arms and one big family			0
this is not true in our case			0
' @entity185 and friends of @entity187 , which we have been part of for 25 years , have crossed over the street rather than speak to us			0
' it ’s as if we ’ve done something wrong			0
all we did is lose @entity27 in the most impossible way			0
not to be able to say goodbye ... @entity27 did n’t deserve that			0
' addressing the media at the end of the trial , chief fire officer mr @entity2 said : ' it is crystal clear that these cases should never have been brought to court			1
' the police investigation into this fire took a wrong turn early on			2
collapse : an aerial view shows the roof of the warehouse after it collapsed killing the four firefighters the @entity212 said it was absurd that the arsonists who started the blaze had never faced trial , while those who struggled to put it out were ' relentlessly pursued ' by police and the @entity85 ' the police treated decent fire officers like common criminals and the arsonist who started this fire has got away with it			1
' it has taken almost five years and £ 5million of public money to construct a case against these three men and when it was presented in court it simply fell apart			0
' during two days in the custody of @entity233 , mr @entity15 , mr @entity14 , and mr @entity16 had their belts and shoelaces taken away and were also held at a police station overnight between interviews			2
mr @entity2 said @entity13 and the chief fire officers ’ @entity236 intended to write to the home secretary and the justice secretary to seek a formal investigation why the firefighters were charged			1
after yesterday 's verdicts , critics said firemen may now hesitate before trying to save lives for fear they could be arrested			0
verdict : after hearing six weeks of evidence jurors decided mr @entity16 and mr @entity14 had not acted illegally during their command of the incident on the evening of november 2 2007 the police officer in charge of the inquiry , detective superintendent @entity252 , insisted the investigation was justified and said he hoped the fire service had learned lessons from the tragedy			1
the union said it was absurd that the arsonists who started the blaze had never faced trial , while those who struggled to put it out were ' relentlessly pursued ' by police and the @entity85			2
@entity212 assistant general secretary @entity267 said : ' this was the first time firefighters at an incident were accused of the manslaughter of their colleagues			1
' this prosecution cast a shadow across the whole fire service and caused anger and concern			2
' we are relieved at the not - guilty verdicts but firefighters are furious at the police and prosecutors			2
' the criminals who started the fire are still free , but those who tried to put the fire out were arrested , charged and brought to trial			1

four firefighters died tackling blaze in @entity3 in 2007
families call fire chief ' hypocritical , arrogant and small minded '
he welcomes acquittal of three firefighters charged with manslaughter
@entity2 said accused were shown ' undue *aggression* ' in custody
