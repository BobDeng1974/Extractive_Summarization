by @entity0 published : 16:25 est , 26 april 2013 updated : 17:49 est , 26 april 2013 a @entity2 congressman who once seriously warned that a @entity2 military buildup on the island of @entity5 could make it ' tip over and capsize ' launched into a speech on the @entity9 floor on thursday mocking about funny - voiced clowns and children without helium for their latex and mylar inflatables			1
' imagine , mr. speaker , a world without balloons , ' @entity17 @entity16 rep. @entity15 urged			1
' how can we make sure that the injustice of there being no helium for comedians to get that high - pitched voice that we all hold near and dear to our hearts			0
' but seriously , ladies and gentlemen , unlike a noble element , this @entity9 has failed to act on @entity2 â€™ real concerns			0
' @entity15 's spokesman , @entity49 , told the @entity50 that @entity15 was only half - joking			0
he was annoyed at @entity31 , @entity49 said , for devoting so much time debating a bill about helium instead of ' working on more important issues such as creating jobs , fixing the sequester and on budget issues			1
' send in the clowns : the @entity17 congressman fretted about cutting off @entity60 from his supply of voice - raising gas ' this tea party @entity63 , ' @entity15 mocked during his speech , ' will make the tough choice to keep children 's birthday parties on schedule , and give industries that rely on helium the lift that they deserve			1
' when @entity15 speaks , a rim - shot is often not far behind			0
in 2010 the congressman said during a @entity76 hearing that an increased presence of military personnel on @entity5 could literally destroy the island by making its weight unbalanced			2
' my fear is that the whole island will become so overly populated that it will tip over and capsize , ' @entity15 said			2
' we do n't anticipate that , ' replied @entity86 admiral @entity85 - to his credit , without laughing			0
island overboard ! @entity15 warned in 2010 that @entity5 could ' tip over ' if too many military families moved there natural gas wells are the most abundant source of natural helium , something which - like the physical makeup of islands - may have escaped @entity15 's notice the helium legislation , which the @entity9 passed 394 - 1 on friday , will allow the federal government to continue selling off its domestic supplies of helium on the open market			1
that , say @entity31 , will help prop up prices for domestic manufacturers by keeping supplies low			0
the current sell - off policy , originally a temporary measure designed to help the government 's helium program pay off its debts , is set to expire later this year			0
helium is plentiful in the earth 's crust , and is harvested as a byproduct of natural gas drilling			1
most existing deposits are sitting in depleted gas wells , waiting for industry to extract them .			2

@entity15 was angry at @entity31 for debating a bill to open the @entity2 helium reserves to the world market
the @entity17 @entity124 warned in 2010 that @entity5 could ' tip over and capsize ' if too many military families moved there
helium is tough to capture but plentiful in natural gas wells
