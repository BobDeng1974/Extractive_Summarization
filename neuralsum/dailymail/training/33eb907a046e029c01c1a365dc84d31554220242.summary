by @entity0 published : 04:29 est , 22 june 2012 updated : 08:36 est , 22 june 2012 when it comes to shopping around for their favourite snacks , youngsters of today are spoiled for choice			1
thanks to the rise of the internet and social media , they are bombarded daily with advertising from new and upcoming brands keen for their cash			0
but a new report has revealed that despite the many different and new temptations on offer , young @entity15 like nothing better than a traditional biscuit			1
popular : a new report has revealed that despite the many different and new temptations on offer , young @entity15 like nothing better than a traditional biscuit , such as a custard cream , pictured what 's your favourite type of biscuit ? classic favourites like custard creams and bourbons are top of the list with young @entity15 who enjoy a traditional indulgent treat just as much as older generations			1
rather than choosing new and innovative biscuits a new report out today has revealed that 16 - 24 - year olds are more likely to opt for the brands popular when granny ’s biscuit tin was being passed around			1
those in their teens and twenties have the biggest appetite for traditional @entity15 biscuits - with six in ten of them disagreeing that traditional biscuits are boring , compared to 55 per cent of their older counterparts aged 55 plus			1
the new research was carried out by market research analysts @entity47			0
its senior food and drink analyst @entity48 said : ' the youth of @entity15 is growing up immersed in digital media , text - speak and cutting - edge gadgetry but this does n’t mean they do n’t appreciate a good old - fashioned @entity55			1
' they may lack tv support or big - name brands , but the humble @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity55 are cherished by teens and students			2
interesting : youngsters in their teens and twenties have the biggest appetite for traditional @entity15 biscuits such as @entity59 and @entity55 - with six in ten of them disagreeing that traditional biscuits are boring ' maybe the lack of try - hard advertising appeals to them - or maybe these biscuits are just better value than the increasingly chocolate - laden new launches			1
either way , the youth of austerity @entity15 has respect for our biscuit heritage			1
' it 's not for lack of choice that consumers are turning to classic biscuits - as innovation in the @entity15 biscuit market has never been higher			1
launches more than doubled in the @entity15 between 2007 and 2011 , rising to over 300 in the past 12 months			1
furthermore , it is mainly younger consumers seeking solace in a biscuit as the majority ( 70 per cent ) of 16 - 24 year - olds would opt for biscuits as an indulgent treat , compared to 62 per cent of the over 55s			1
mature consumers , however , are far more likely to keep the time - honoured tradition of dunking alive - only 46 per cent of younger consumers ( 16 - 24 ) enjoy a biscuit with a hot drink as opposed to 63 per cent of the over 45s			1
the survey of 1,500 people showed that an increasing number of @entity104 ca n’t keep their hands from the cookie jar - with 86 per cent of @entity104 in 2011 eating sweet biscuits compared to 83 per cent in 2010			2
today , 15 per cent of @entity104 confess to eating sweet biscuits once a day or more and nearly half ( 47 per cent ) admit they like to treat themselves with foods that are not good for them			2
worried : almost half of all women say they feel guilty about eating biscuits and when it comes to eating occasions , it seems biscuits are seen as a good way to help productivity , with nearly two in five ( 38 per cent ) @entity104 munching on them at work or college or university , rising to 58 per cent users in full - time education			2
but despite @entity15 ’s biscuit love - there is one thing casting a shadow across the popularity of the biscuit - the guilt factor			1
overall , nearly two fifths ( 36 per cent ) of biscuit eaters say they feel guilty about eating biscuits , a figure that rises to almost half ( 46 per cent ) of all women			0
a strong demand for healthier biscuit options is also reflected in the fact that 40 per cent of consumers admit they would eat more if they were lower in sugar			0
mr @entity48 added : ' women have rather a conflicted relationship with biscuits			0
they are more likely than men to indulge in them as a treat , but are then far more likely to feel guilty about it			0
' unfortunately , the healthy biscuits that are on the market are tarnished with a bland reputation , making that chocolate biscuit all the more tempting			0
' indeed , healthy issues can represent the battleground for the biscuit industry , as two in five consumers believe that there are n’t enough of these available - but at the same time almost half ( 48 per cent ) of consumers think low - fat and healthy biscuits taste ' bland '			0
in 2011 , no additives or preservatives was the most used health claim for new products , accounting for a quarter of new product launches in the @entity15 ’s sweet biscuit sector			2
and it is @entity174 consumers who eat the most sweet biscuits , with 20 per cent of consumers in that region eating them once a day or more			0
they are closely followed by those in the @entity179 with 19 per cent , 16 per cent in @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity182 , 15 per cent in the @entity183 , 14 per cent in the @entity184 and @entity185 , 13 per cent in the @entity184 and @entity186			0
while 12 per cent of @entity187 and those in the @entity189 have biscuits every day			0
in terms of value , total retail value sales climbed by a sweet 26 per cent since 2006 to reach £ 1.4 billion in 2011			0
and it appears the sector has unwrapped success for the future too , as @entity47 expects it to grow a further 21 per cent to reach £ 1.7 billion by 2016			0
but it is the appeal of everyday biscuits , or plain biscuits , such as digestives , that have boosted the fortunes of the market , with sales value up 14 per cent in just one year ( 2010 - 11 ) , with children ’s biscuits also doing well with sales value up 8 per cent over the same period to reach a market value of £ 143 million in 2011			2
conversely biscuit bundle packs have suffered , with value sales down 14 per cent over the past year to a value of £ 6 million in 2011 .			0
