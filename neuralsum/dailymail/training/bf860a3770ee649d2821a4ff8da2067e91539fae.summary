@entity0 only completed his £ 2million switch to @entity2 on friday , but already the former @entity4 goalkeeper has lined up in full kit for his new side			1
but it was n't for a competitive game , or even a pre-season friendly , it was for the club 's official team photo where the @entity14 side proudly showed off three of the four trophies they won last term			1
there was no room for the @entity19 , but @entity0 sat proudly in the first row just in front of the @entity22 and the @entity14 league title , with the @entity24 also featuring in the picture			2

there 's not long to go until the new season begins ! @entity0 sent a message to @entity4 fans after sealing his @entity71 switch			0
in a letter headlined ' once a @entity104 a @entity103 ' the former @entity4 ' keeper addressed the fans and signed off with ' @entity105 , @entity0			2
' he says that he knew his time at the club was over before the last campaign and updated the fans from a letter last year on what he called ' an honour and a priviledge			0
' the move to @entity71 reunites @entity0 with his former captain at @entity115 , @entity47 , and he says he wanted to enjoy his time with the @entity14 champions as much as his time at @entity4			1
finally , he tells fans that he now counts himself as a @entity119 and he looks forward to returning to @entity120 as a fan			0
