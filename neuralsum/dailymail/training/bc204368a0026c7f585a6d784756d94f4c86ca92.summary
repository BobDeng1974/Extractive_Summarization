for most clubs , it would be sufficient to fill a working week with @entity3 quarter - final qualification , the resignation and jailing of their legendary president plus the outside world poring over every grim detail			1
but @entity9 are not , and have never been , any old club			1
partly thanks to the career of @entity12			1
nevertheless , in the full knowledge that his @entity14 - winning former @entity15 and @entity9 team - mate , @entity16 , was likely to be convicted and given jail time the following day and that for some in @entity20 it might already feel like the world was caving in , @entity12 chose wednesday to rake the club ’s current football philosophy and expensively - hired new coach with his perpetually sharp claws			1
not his way ? @entity27 reacts during @entity9 's victory over @entity29 in the @entity3 defensive : @entity9 legend @entity12 was uncomplimentary on @entity27 's tactics to explain			1
it ’s the 36th minute of the @entity34 champions ’ 1 - 1 draw with @entity29 in @entity36			2
@entity37 has driven forward and , having scored six times from the left - back position for club and country this season , feels entitled to shoot			2
the @entity43 drags an effort meekly wide			2
on the touchline @entity27 grimaces , not in frustration that the ball has n’t gone in but at @entity37 ’s choice of action			2
the @entity50 briefly beats both hands on his shaven skull			0
with 26 minutes left , @entity53 sees a free channel down the middle of the pitch , just like the one he used to burst through and score 10 minutes previously			0
he strides towards goal and , when @entity58 attempts to close him down , instead of passing to either @entity59 or @entity60 , who are free , he shoots over from the edge of the @entity63 time @entity27 is angry			0
from the touchline he calls @entity53 ’s attention in order to reprimand him			0
miss : @entity53 took a shot from far out which @entity27 was very annoyed about @entity12 ca n’t believe it — and tells the world on @entity72 : ‘ this will end with us resembling @entity75 and nobody will want to watch us			1
we risk boring the fans			1
these players are being told to pass the ball right up to the goal - line			0
‘ if this is now the @entity9 philosophy , it may bring us our joyful moments but we ’ll probably end up playing like @entity75 and , when we actually get to the goal - line , we ’ll recycle the ball and pass it backwards rather than scoring			1
‘ i have another view			0
if i can shoot from distance , above all against a massed defence , then i have to do that			0
it ’s an effective formula			0
notwithstanding @entity93 , @entity94 or @entity95 , @entity12 is by some distance the club ’s greatest footballer — world champion for @entity9 and @entity15 as player and coach			1
wild : @entity37 was another who irked @entity27 after he shot when the @entity103 wished he had n't currently @entity9 ’s honorary president , his role is non-executive			1
even if some of his declarations are now taken with a pinch of salt , such denigratory words about the football fundamentals of the @entity27 era will undermine the coach , give fuel to any player unhappy under the @entity50 ’s steely rule and the use of a word like ‘ boring ’ will obviously not thrill the sponsors who help fund the coach ’s £ 7.5m ( nine million euros ) salary			2
it would n’t be accurate to call the words a ‘ cheap shot ’			1
no question they are what @entity12 believes			1
with the departure of @entity16 and promotion of his deputy on @entity9 ’s company advisory board , @entity135 ( @entity136 chairman ) , there is the opportunity for further corporate instability			1
the thudding shock of the outgoing man ’s jail term will reverberate amongst players , media and fans for a considerable time			2
@entity16 is indelibly linked to @entity9 ’s sense of wellbeing and identity			1
behind bars : former @entity9 president @entity16 was jailed for tax evasion in the week for @entity12 to call into question the entire @entity27 experiment is therefore something which both the @entity50 ( extremely sensitive to such matters ) and his employers could have done without			1
@entity27 has already explained , clearly , also to @entity72 : ‘ to have big , big possession but not create chances and just defend — that ’s not football			0
i like when my team has the ball but possession for itself is nothing			0
i like it more when the ball goes at high speed to the players in the right positions than the players move position a lot			0
’ @entity9 have romped the @entity170 and should contest the @entity171 against @entity172			2
retaining the @entity3 now becomes the top priority			1
sore though @entity9 ’s former coach @entity175 will be that his firm friend @entity16 has fallen so far , the 67 - year - old will still afford a grim chuckle at @entity27 ’s expense			2
@entity175 had to cope with all of this himself			0
this is how he deconstructs his handling of the traumas of @entity9			2
champions : @entity9 managed 50 games unbeaten on saturday as they beat @entity185 2 - 1 ‘ you ’ve got to be able to transmit a sense of serenity to your players , ’ he said			1
‘ @entity191 ( @entity95 ) and @entity16 ( @entity192 ) had a tendency to panic and ask too many questions			0
i learned early on how to cope with stress			0
‘ despite having to compete for places , my players were all pulling in the same direction			0
the atmosphere in the dressing room was exceptional			0
i handed over a complete , ultra-competitive team to my successor			0
but is the harmony in jeopardy ? the next few weeks will be the litmus test .			0

@entity12 claimed @entity9 risked ' boring fans '
the timing of @entity12 's ' cheap shot ' could not have been worse
retaining @entity3 is now @entity9 's no 1 priority following *domestic* *domination*
