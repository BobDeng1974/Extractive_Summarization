from drones so tiny they fit in your hand to crafts that plot their terrain using 3d mapping - the latest and greatest flying machines have gone on display in @entity9			1
manufacturers are using this year 's cebit technology event to showcase their remote - controlled and autonomous quad and hexacopters to potential partners and customers			1
these include the @entity17 micro quadcopter that measures just 1.7 - inches ( 4.5cm ) and the @entity19 drone that flies at 12 metres per second			1
manufacturers are using this year 's cebit technology event in @entity9 to showcase their latest remote - controlled and autonomous drones			1
these include the @entity17 micro quadcopter , from @entity25 - based @entity24			1
it measures just 1.7 - inches ( 4.5cm ) , has a six - axis gyroscope built in and flies for up to seven minutes the @entity28 is known as a micro , or nano , copter and is designed by @entity25 manufacturer @entity24			2
it has a built - in six - axis gyroscope to keep it stable and can fly for up to seven minutes			0
the tiny craft has a remote range of 98ft ( 30 metres )			0
meanwhile , @entity37 's @entity19 drone flew around the event in @entity39 with a hd camera attached			1
it takes off and lands using a one - click control and comes with @entity44 and gps built in			0
an led indicator panel on the remote - control additionally reveals real - time flight status and battery level			0
meanwhile @entity50 's @entity19 drone flew around the event in @entity39 with a hd camera attached ( pictured )			1
it takes off and lands using a one - click control and comes with @entity44 and gps built in			0
an led indicator panel on the remote - control additionally reveals real - time flight status and battery level and it is n't just manufacturers displaying their machines , robotic researchers from the @entity63 are also using the show to reveal their latest innovations			2
during one demonstrations , students from the university 's robotics and @entity69 released a drone that flies autonomously ( pictured ) the firm said : ' @entity73 is built for an optimal aerial experience and carefree flight manoeuvers			1
' powered by an advanced built - in @entity76 , the x-star is extremely reliable and easy to fly			0
' and it is n't just manufacturers displaying their machines , robotic researchers from the @entity63 are also using the show to reveal their latest innovations			2
during one demonstration , students from the university 's @entity82 released a drone that flies autonomously			1
the autonomous drone is fitted with cameras and sensors that map its surroundings in @entity91 , which in turn help the it to learn the terrain			2
the group is led by professor @entity96 and its lab was founded in february 2012 as part of the @entity99 at the university it is is fitted with cameras and sensors that map its surroundings in @entity91 , which in turn help the drone learn the terrain			2
the group is led by professor @entity96 and its lab was founded in february 2012 as part of the @entity99 at the university			0
' our mission is to develop autonomous machines that can navigate all by themselves using only onboard cameras , without relying on external infrastructure , such as gps or motion capture systems , ' explained the group			0
' our interests encompass both ground and micro flying robots , as well as multi-robot heterogeneous systems consisting of the combination of these two			0
' we do not want our machines to be passive , but active , in that they should react to and navigate within their environment so as to gain the best knowledge from it			0
' the technology show runs until friday			2
in this image visitors to the @entity130 show in @entity39 are looking at hexacopter drone equipped with advanced video transmission capabilities at @entity133 stand			1
the technology and it show runs until friday			0

drones are on display at this year 's @entity130 technology show in @entity9
the @entity17 micro quadcopter is small enough to fit in the palm of a hand
while the @entity19 quadcopter from @entity37 travels at 12 metres per second
other drones on display include @entity150 's hexacopter and a drone that flies autonomously and learns its terrain developed at the @entity63
