she selected it from the twelve glittering gold and white creations that the @entity40 had sent for the occasion			2
unusually , the @entity1 acquired the show model , rather than specially commissioning another gown from the designers			1

she was photographed wearing it on july 4 1986 to attend a banquet for a state visit of @entity57 , the president of the @entity58 at the time			2
on this occasion she chose to wear a glittering diamond tiara to accessorize the gown , but wore no petticoat which produced a slimmer look and revealed her ankles			1

this was followed by the headline - grabbing black taffeta gown she wore for her first public engagement with prince @entity105 after the announcement of their engagement at @entity109 in 1981 ( now affectionately known as the ' @entity111 ' dress ) , sold for £ 192,000			2
of course the most memorable and important @entity23 dress of them all was the royal bridal gown for her marriage to prince @entity105 in 1981			1
premiere : she was also photographed in the gown when she attended the premiere of the @entity85 film ' @entity86 ' on june 29 , 1987 the @entity90 went on to make special ensembles and evening gowns for @entity1 's important overseas state tours with the @entity105 , as well as producing a wardrobe of maternity wear during her pregnancies			1

another intriguing royal memento going under the hammer is a tiny pair of bellows used for powdering the wig of ( the famously oft - times mad ) @entity144 made from mahogany with an ivory tip , it is painted in gold with his @entity149 – a kingly crown with ‘ @entity151 ’ - and estimated to fetch between £ 1000 - 1500			0
it is just 16cm ( 6 1/4in long ) and would have been used by his valet to administer the fashionable tinted powder to the wig before it was placed on the royal head			0
another intriguing royal memento going under the hammer is a tiny pair of bellows used for powdering the wig of ( the famously oft - times mad ) @entity144 powdered hair wigs were all the rage for most of the 18th century – the practice falling from favour when the powder became heavily taxed in the 1790s			0
wig powder was made from finely ground starch often scented with orange blossom or lavender and came in pastel violet , blue and pink shades , but the most popular colour was off - white			0
' it seems strange to us in an age when youth is seen as the most desirable aesthetic ideal – that people seemed intent on making themselves appear much older , ' said a spokesperson for @entity7 auctions			0
@entity144 ’s penchant for elaborate towering wigs in his youth resulted in him being lampooned by the artist @entity185 who poked fun at the wigs worn at his @entity188 in 1761 – with the engraving ‘ @entity190 ’			0
