by @entity0 published : 06:33 est , 16 january 2014 updated : 06:41 est , 16 january 2014 poor @entity3 - he 's around them all day long at the fast food chain where he works part - time , but @entity7 , 20 , has a big problem : a phobia of onions			1
his chronic food fear - officially known as alliumphobia - means that although he 's surrounded by food at the @entity14 's restaurant where he works , he is drastically underweight for his six foot height			1
so while many start the @entity17 needing to shift a few pounds , @entity3 , from @entity18 in @entity19 , wants to pile them on			2
@entity3 scans food ingredients in a desperate bid to avoid onions , his food phobia he 's surrounded by fast food but a phobia of onions leaves @entity7 seriously underweight for his height but when he 's not working , he 's busy frantically scanning food ingredients for dreaded mentions of onions , the food stuff that freaks him out			1
at 6ft and weighing in at just eight and half stone , @entity3 was short of energy and knew he was seriously underweight for his height			2
on average , he was eating a quarter of the 3,000 calories he should have been getting for a man his age and height , having an energy drink for breakfast , no lunch and a tiny plate of pasta for dinner			1
clothes hang off skinny @entity3 , who works around onions at @entity44 but has a phobia of them a manager at @entity44 , the media student at @entity49 said : ' i was n’t a picky eater as a kid			1
i was one of those who ’d have to have a clean plate before they could leave the table and would eat the same meals as my parents			2
i shot up at 14 and as i got older i knew i was n’t the correct weight for someone of my height but i ’ve never had much of an appetite			2
it does n’t help that i ’ve got an onion phobia			2
' i have no idea why but everything about them i do n’t like			0
onions are a complete no - go for me and they are in so many meals			1
i ’m constantly checking the lists of ingredients of things to see if there are onions as they are in so many meals			1
' despite enjoying dishes such as steak , fish and a sunday roast , @entity3 has struggled over the years to put on weight and his image was starting to have a negative impact on his mood			0
@entity3 wants to pile on the pounds but his onion phobia gets in the way wanting help , he applied for tv show @entity87 vs @entity89 and tonight his efforts to pile on the pounds with the help of tv medic dr @entity93 will be aired on @entity94			0
being partnered with someone struggling to lose weight @entity3 , who splits his time between @entity49 and his parents ’ home in @entity18 , had to match meal - for - meal the diet of @entity102 , weighing in at more than 19 stone , before the pair embarked on personalised diet plans			1
' i was having to eat fried chicken , pizzas , all different kinds of takeaways every three hours a day			0
i was taking in 6,000 calories and found it really difficult , ' said @entity3			0
' by the end of each day i felt physically drained with the sheer amount of food			0
we were then given a diet plan and given six weeks to try and change our weight			0
' i decided to do it for myself and started making changes eating what i thought would be better			1
it was a conscious effort each day to make my portion sizes bigger and make sure i had three meals a day as well as snacking			0
' in six weeks @entity3 put on half a stone , and by sticking to his new diet plan , he ’s now nearing a one stone weight gain			0
@entity3 , who still works at the fast food chain in his home town said : ' during the show i was told it is harder for people to lose weight than put it on and you have to double your daily calorie intake to put on just a couple of pounds			1
' i ’ve been sticking with it and would like to get up to 10 stone , and if i reach that target i ’ll keep going			0

onions are a ' no go ' area , for 20 - year - old media student @entity7
he 's constantly checking ingredients for dreaded mention of onions
as a result , he 's eating just a quarter of his *recommended* calorie intake
