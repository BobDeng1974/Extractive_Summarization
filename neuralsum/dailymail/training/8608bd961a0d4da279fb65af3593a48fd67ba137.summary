they first appeared on stage together in 1935 and were once photographed chummily arm in arm			0
but behind the scenes , a poisonous rivalry appears to have soured @entity12 ’s view of @entity13			1
party snub : sir @entity12 's ( with wife @entity15 in 1964 ) opinions of fellow actor @entity13 have been revealed in his personal diaries , part of an archive acquired by the @entity20 for privately , sir @entity12 thought his fellow thespian cruel , unpleasant , destructive and pretentious			1

’ arm in arm : sir @entity12 ( right ) branded sir @entity13 ( left ) ' unpleasant ' in his diary despite sharing accolades as the greatest actors of their generation even on the day after @entity13 ’s death in july 1989 , @entity12 apparently could n’t bring himself to join the public tributes unreservedly			1
in his diary , he branded @entity13 ‘ unpleasant , possibly even vindictive ’			2
later entries included snide observations about @entity13 ’s performances , notably his ‘ trick ’ for making @entity41 memorable by reading it like ‘ flashes of lightning ’			2
‘ he would chose an obscure line and give it extraordinary emphasis , ’ sir @entity12 wrote			1
‘ his “ i defy you , stars ” in @entity53 was memorable			0
and so was his “ poor naked wretches etc ” in @entity49			0
‘ but his famous howl in @entity55 i thought just tiresome			0
’ in a waspishly barbed compliment , @entity12 pays homage to his fellow actor ’s acknowledged mastery of production : ‘ he knew every trick of the trade and used every one , including when he made his first entrance , the lights coming up a few points and going down again when he left			2
’ an indication that the venom and cattiness was not simply one way came when @entity12 recalled a clash in 1983 , when @entity13 either failed or feigned not to recognise his wife at a party			1
@entity12 thought @entity13 was joking at first when he asked her name			1
‘ oh yes , ’ @entity13 had said			2

he duly records : ‘ i could see @entity91 [ @entity92 ] in the room , and , bitchily , i could n’t resist asking , “ is @entity91 here ? ” “ over there , ” he said			0
“ do point her out , ” i said , and then moved away			0
’ @entity12 ’s 900 letters and more than 100 volumes of diaries were compiled during a lifetime in acting			2
they were bought recently from his family as part of an archive released more than 12 years after the death of the actor , who won an @entity106 for his role in @entity108 and went on to play spymaster @entity109 in @entity110 and @entity111 in @entity112			2
@entity12 once appeared in a photograph – not in the archive – that showed him arm in arm with @entity13 , alongside fellow actor sir @entity116			1

the archive also reveals @entity12 to have been deeply superstitious			0
ambitious : sir @entity13 ( pictured in @entity123 in 1944 ) was said to have a cruel and destructive streak he describes having a misplaced premonition while serving as an officer in the @entity127 during the war that he would ‘ die tomorrow ’			1
