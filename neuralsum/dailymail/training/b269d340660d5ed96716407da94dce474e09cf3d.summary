by @entity1 reporter published : 21:22 est , 5 august 2013 updated : 08:10 est , 6 august 2013 civil war photographer @entity2 largely taught himself the finer points of the two pursuits that have linked his name to history : taking pictures and self - promotion			1
the son of @entity11 immigrant farmers had a talent for cajoling presidents , generals and business leaders to sit before his camera			0
other than his birth around 1823 in @entity18 , @entity19 , little is recorded about @entity2 's early life , a challenge for biographer @entity22			2
yet readers of ' @entity2 : portraits of a @entity25 ' probably benefit from this dearth of personal information			2
@entity22 moves quickly to what matters most - @entity2 's role in how we see @entity31 in the mid- to late 19th century			1
war photographer @entity2 , the son of @entity11 immigrant farmers had a talent for cajoling presidents , generals and business leaders to sit before his camera time warp : a portrait of captain @entity38 , 1st @entity40 @entity39 , and his servant @entity41 in camp at @entity43 , @entity44 , in the winter of 1861 - 1862 timing was on @entity2 's side when , as a teenager , he left the countryside for the big city around 1840			1
the early photographic process called daguerreotype , invented in @entity53 , arrived in @entity54 just ahead of him			0
he may have taken lessons in the technique while supporting himself as a clerk at a fabric store			0
in 1844 , @entity2 opened a photographic studio that produced portraits , and after five years of success , he started a studio in @entity63			2
@entity22 makes a compelling case that @entity2 eventually rose above a sea of artistic entrepreneurs offering photographic portraits because he learned , and often advanced , the latest techniques			2
as important , he had a pleasing manner that put subjects at ease during the time - consuming process of getting a picture taken			2
heroic : @entity2 studio portrait of colonel @entity75 , a @entity76 officer who won the @entity77 for his bravery during the @entity79 in 1862 vengeful : portrait of sergeant @entity82 , an enlisted man in @entity84 's @entity83 - who witnessed @entity84 's death and immediately killed the assailant future president : @entity88 , who would be the 20th president of the @entity31 , and was assassinated after only six months in office in 1881 , as a @entity91 general , ca			1
1855 - 1865 @entity2 also understood how publicity worked back then			1
the @entity93 in his @entity95 studio featured a gallery of celebrities - a subtle pitch for others to pay a few dollars for portraits of their own			0
few would not want to sit for the studio that photographed war heroes like gen. @entity104 , naturalist and painter @entity104 and the elderly former first lady @entity106			0
general @entity108 " @entity109 ( 1836 - 1881 ) , a @entity91 officer noted for his ill - conceived cavalry raids into @entity111 held territory during the @entity113 top o ' the mornin ' to ya : a portrait of brigadier general @entity117 ( 1823 - 1867 ) , commander of @entity119 's @entity118 ( @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 ) during the @entity113 in 1849 , president @entity124 allowed @entity2 to take his photograph in the @entity126 , as did his successor , @entity127 , a sign of @entity2 's growing reputation			1
a decade later , when the nation seemed destined to fracture over slavery , @entity2 was , as @entity22 puts it , at the ' height of his fame as a photographer of celebrities '			1
war photographer @entity2 , pictured left in early june , 1864 , in @entity44 , with major general @entity137 ( left ) at 9th @entity139 headquarters at @entity140 , @entity44 on the front line : @entity142 , left , sits in his tent with one of his generals during the @entity113 military base : a federal encampment at @entity148 on the @entity149 , in may 1862 , photographed by @entity150 his 1860 photograph of a beardless @entity152 pulled up the collars on @entity142 's shirt and coat , probably to hide his long neck - helped to make the presidential aspirant known around the country			1
the @entity113 created a strong demand for photographs of soldiers in studio settings and in encampments			0
the custom of the time was for the studio 's owner to take the credit , not those working in the studio or in the field			0
while @entity2 shared credit with his photographers some of the time and traveled to battlefields such as @entity177 , his name is associated with many photographs he did n't take			0
a @entity2 portrait of of general @entity180 ( center ) and his aides - de - camp , major general @entity185 @entity184 ( left ) and col. @entity186 ( right ) , taken in @entity187 , @entity44 , on april 16 , 1865 @entity2 's experience at @entity189 - he lost his equipment in the chaotic retreat that marked the @entity193 's first major battle - may have cooled his eagerness to ask those working for him to photograph close to actual fighting			1
as the war continued , photographic images of dead soldiers , slain horses and other post-battle carnage brought to the public a face of war most had never seen			0
a 1862 photograph of @entity31 president @entity142 by @entity2 tragic : @entity88 , who would be the 20th president of the @entity31 , and was assassinated after only six months in office in 1881 , with his daughter , ca			0

engraving by @entity223 , from an 1893 photograph by @entity2 studio portrait of major general @entity226 ( 182 - 1891 ) in @entity63 , 1865 , by @entity2			1
@entity226 is considered one of the ablest @entity228 of the @entity113 the snapper : war photographer @entity2 became a successful and sought after photographer for the country 's presidents and colonels @entity22 argues that @entity2 's role in promoting wartime images through his studios and the print media was crucial to their impact even if he was n't the man behind the camera			1
with @entity22 's keen analysis of @entity2 's life and times and the images that defined them , ' @entity2 : portraits of a @entity25 ' brings into sharp focus a fascinating footnote to @entity31 history			0
the book is available in the @entity31 here and in the @entity254 , here			0
