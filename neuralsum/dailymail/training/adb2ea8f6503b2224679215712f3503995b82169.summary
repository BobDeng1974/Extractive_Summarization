a schoolboy with sickle cell disease died after a junior doctor ignored instructions from his consultant to carry out a blood test , an inquest has heard			1
@entity7 , seven , from @entity8 , collapsed and died during a blood transfusion after staff ' missed opportunities ' to save his life			1
the boy suffered a cardiac arrest during the transfusion at @entity16 , @entity17			1
it was carried out on february 11 , four days after the youngster was admitted to hospital			2
@entity7 , seven , from @entity8 , collapsed and died during a blood transfusion after staff ' missed opportunities ' to save his life but the coroner said that blood tests should have been carried out much earlier			1
if they were , it would have shown a transfusion was required far sooner - perhaps even on the day he arrived			2
instead , there was ' insufficient understanding ' of the boy 's condition and a ' lack of urgency ' before any action was taken			0
the schoolboy suffered from sickle cell disease , a hereditary disorder that can cause red blood cells to mutate and restrict blood flow , @entity17 @entity42 was told			1
the condition was spotted by a gp who referred him to the hospital			0
after he was admitted , dr @entity48 , a consultant paediatrician , set up a five - point treatment plan in which she asked for his haemoglobin , or hb , levels to be monitored			1
that meant taking blood tests to ensure it was still at a healthy level			0
if the figure fell below five , it would show a definite need for a transfusion , dr @entity48 told the court			2
but her direct instructions were ignored by @entity68 staff , the court heard			1
the inquest heard how a junior doctor failed to take the tests when covering the weekend shift			0
it was only when another doctor took over four days later that a blood test was taken and a transfusion was finally requested			1
the doctor found the blood had clotted			0
after the request , there was still a four - hour wait for the correct blood type to arrive			2
the hb level was at just 2.7 grams when the transfusion was eventually performed			0
the young boy , pictured with his sister @entity86 , suffered from sickle cell disease , a hereditary disorder that can cause red blood cells to mutate and restrict blood flow dr @entity48 said she was ' horrified ' when she learned her treatment plan had not been followed through by a junior doctor without consultation			1
senior coroner @entity94 gave the cause of death as cardiac failure caused by severe anaemia due to sickle cell disease			0
mrs @entity94 said : ' in my conclusion i do find a gross failure in not doing the blood test on the tenth ( of february ) when there was a clear clinical need and a clear direction to do so			2
' there were other failures - to provide a transfusion on either the eighth , ninth or tenth ... a failure by all staff to not recognise they had insufficient understanding of this condition and an appreciation of this very serious condition			1
' mrs @entity94 ordered for a report to be sent to @entity117 in the @entity118 and @entity119 to ensure all trusts were better placed to treat patients with sickle cell disease			0
@entity7 's father @entity123 wrote a letter of complaint to @entity68 and spoke of his loss in a written statement read out in court			1
' the whole experience was very traumatic for us , ' he said			0
the young boy died after suffering a cardiac arrest at collapsing during the blood transfusion at @entity16 , @entity17 ' he was our youngest child and only son			1
we had been trying for another child since 1997 and had to wait until 2005			0
we moved to the @entity136 in 2006 to give our children a better life			0
' it 's impossible for us to have another child now due to my wife 's age			0
we are still struggling to come to terms with it and have constant recollections of his pain			2
' @entity7 was admitted to hospital complaining of a fever , leg pains and dizziness			2
his healthy hb ' base ' level was 8.5 grams per deciliter of whole blood , but it dropped to 5.7 grams shortly after his admission			0
it was at just 2.7 grams when the transfusion was eventually performed			0
dr @entity158 , a consultant haematologist at @entity159 , which had been approached for advice on @entity7 's treatment , said transfusions should be performed when a patient 's hb count is more than two grams below their base level .			1

@entity7 was transferred to @entity16 , @entity17
a five - point plan set up by a consultant was ' dismissed ' by one of her staff
court heard blood transfusion should have been carried out on february 10
when finally arranged , boy collapsed during *procedure* and had heart attack
his father @entity123 said : ' we have constant recollection of his pain '
