pre-election pledges to boost @entity2 funding are not enough to keep the health service free at the point of use , leading medical experts have warned			1
in the run up to the general election next year , the @entity9 , @entity7 and @entity8 have all vowed to increase spending on the @entity2			1
@entity13 promised the biggest boost to health spending of the main three parties - vowing to hike the @entity2 budget by £ 2.5billion a year			1
but an influential coalition of doctors , nurses and medical charities has warned that the promises are nowhere near enough to fill the £ 30 billion black hole which has left the health service at ‘ breaking point ’			1
the @entity2 needs an extra £ 30billion a year to keep it free at the point of use for everybody , medical charities have warned in an open letter to the leaders of all three parties published by the @entity33 , the leading organisations said ‘ the longest , and most damaging budget squeeze ’ in @entity2 history had left the service in crisis			1
health spending has been protected from the austerity cuts imposed across most of the rest of @entity42 but had not risen enough to prevent the hospitals and surgeries ‘ buckling under the twin crises of rising demand and flatlining budgets ’ , they wrote			0
the letter was signed by the heads of the @entity49 , the @entity50 , the @entity51 and four other royal colleges , the @entity53 , the @entity54 , the @entity55 , the @entity56 , the @entity57 , the @entity58 and the @entity59			0
they said : ‘ savings have been made , and despite the best efforts of nurses , doctors and other staff , patients have not been insulated from these cuts			2
too many staff feel undervalued and demoralised when all they want is to be able to care for patients			0
‘ a shortage of @entity71 means that patients are struggling to get an appointment to see their doctor			0
pressures on maternity services mean that many women are not getting the high quality care they deserve			0
’ accident and emergency unit targets were being missed - in some cases for an entire year - patients faced ‘ unacceptable ’ waits for cancer diagnoses , and patients requiring emergency mental health support were being moved to hospitals hundreds of miles away from home			0
social care shortfalls meant dementia sufferers ‘ have been cut adrift , reliant on unpaid and unsupported carers to live from day to day ’ and problems were being stored up for the future by a failure to invest properly in children and young people 's physical and mental health , they suggested			0
@entity97 announced that a future @entity99 government would increase spending on the @entity2 every year @entity7 chief secretary to the treasury @entity101 ( left ) and @entity8 leader @entity13 ( right ) have used the party conference season to promise an increase in @entity2 spending ‘ the @entity2 and our social care services are at breaking point and things can not go on like this			1
an @entity2 deficit of £ 30 billion is predicted by 2020 - a funding black hole that must be filled			1
‘ while we welcome the fact that the @entity2 has risen to the top of the political agenda , and some new spending commitments have been made , we need a comprehensive , fully costed , long - term spending plan if an @entity2 true to its founding principles of universal healthcare , provided according to need not ability to pay , is secured for future generations			2
‘ it must also take into account the need for vital social care			0
this will also require a guarantee that the @entity2 will be protected from another top - down reorganisation which is not in the best interests of patients , and distracts from the severe , long - term funding pressures facing the health service			2
the @entity2 , social services , health and care professionals and above all , the @entity130 people , deserve no less .			2

@entity9 , @entity7 and @entity8 have pledged to increase spending on the @entity2
doctors , nurses and medical charities warn the promises are not enough
@entity2 is at ' breaking point ' and needs an extra £ 30billion to keep service free
