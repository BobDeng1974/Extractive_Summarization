by @entity0 and @entity1 in @entity2 pro-russian rebels claim to have shot down a @entity5 spy drone just a few miles from the site of the @entity8 disaster			1
the footage released on @entity10 by the self - proclaimed @entity11 - which has not been independently verified - shows a military craft lying in a field near the rebel - dominated city of @entity16 in eastern @entity5			1
fighters posted an image posing next to the device and making the peace sign on the @entity22 equivalent of @entity23 , declaring themselves ' heroes '			1
and the rebels claimed it happened at 1.30pm local time yesterday , just as international experts gathered at the @entity8 crash site to search for evidence			2
in a statement yesterday on @entity58 , @entity22 's equivalent of @entity23 , the separatists wrote : ' according to a report from military correspondents to the ministry of information , at approximately 13.30 near @entity64 fighters of @entity66 unit from number 20 check point on the @entity16 - @entity69 highway detected and shot down a @entity5 flying object , supposedly a drone			1
' @entity73 reconnaissance group found the spot where it fell ; right now the object is still at the crash site			0
' investigation : international experts were at long last allowed to access the @entity8 crash site , even as another aircraft was shot down @entity81 experts collect evidence as they examine the area of the @entity85 plane crash in the village of @entity49 ( @entity87 ) , some 80km east of @entity16 wreckage : the experts are pictured yesterday at the crash site , where they have begun their recovery work a team of @entity81 experts examines a waterway as they scour the @entity8 crash site			1
their efforts were brought to a halt due to shelling nearby sniffer dogs working on the vast crash site in eastern @entity5 helped uncover the remains of more victims of the @entity8 attack today the claim appeared to be backed up by @entity5 's military , according to the respected @entity103 news agency			1
it reported @entity5 's military as saying separatists had hit an army drone with a missile similar to the type of system it alleges was used to strike @entity46			1
the claim prompted scorn on social media , though - as unlike the passenger jet , the drone appeared remarkably intact			1
and because the unmanned craft are rocket - launched , it could have come to earth following its mission using a parachute , as is normal for the same type of drone			0
still open : people were pictured today walking through the crash site area , which has been opened to experts parked behind the aircraft , which carried the blue and yellow trident emblem of the @entity5 military on its tail ( far right ) , was parked a truck spray - painted with the @entity22 flag			1
it came as the @entity8 probe continued communication : the image of the craft in a field near @entity16 was posted on @entity58 , the ' @entity22 @entity23 ' comparison : one user of the social networking site posted this photograph of a @entity35 - era @entity142 drone close : the rebels said the site was near @entity145 , about 15 miles from the @entity8 crash site entered service : late 1970s use : @entity35 , @entity148 crew : unmanned length : 26ft @entity152 : 7ft weight : 1.2 tonnes top speed : 590mph range : 124 miles service ceiling ( high altitude ) : 16,400ft @entity159 flight @entity8 was shot down on july 17 , killing all 298 people on board			1
it has still not been established how it was destroyed , though many politicians laid the blame at @entity165 rebels which hold the area			0
but the circumstances are mired in confusion and even if rebels were to blame , it is not known if they knew what they were shooting			0
pro-russians on the social networking site identified the downed drone , which bore the blue and yellow trident emblem of the @entity5 military , as a @entity35 - era spy craft			1
they said it was a @entity180 drone , a claim repeated by the @entity22 news outlet @entity183 , which reported on the video earlier today			0
there are huge differences between the craft pictured and the passenger airliner			0
it would have been flying much lower than the 33,000ft at which @entity8 was flying , and unlike the passenger jet , it appeared unusually - remarkably - intact in the field , leading some to doubt the rebels ' claims that they shot it down			1
a rocket - launched short - range craft , @entity197 were used by the @entity35 @entity198 in the 1970s and 1980s , and @entity183 claimed units were kept in use by @entity5 after the @entity35 collapsed			2
footage of the craft posted by rebels showed its ageing machinery lying in the field near @entity16 a statement by the rebels said : ' according to a report from military correspondents to the ministry of information , at approximately 13.30 near @entity212 fighters shot down a @entity5 flying object ' the footage was posted yesterday as the largest team of experts yet gathered at the site of the @entity8 disaster			1
using sniffer dogs , the 101 experts - many of them from @entity220 and the @entity81 , where many victims hailed from - found new evidence including human remains			0
roads had for days been too dangerous to use because of heavy fighting , which frustrated the efforts to move an investigation forward			0
and today the investigators were forced to seek cover again because of shelling , according to @entity103			0
a woman pushes her bicycle near the crash site of the @entity235 in the village of @entity49 ( @entity87 ) , some 80km east of @entity16 a man rides his motorbike past a piece of the wreckage , lying beside the road in @entity49 a man talks on his mobile phone just a short distance from a section of the downed jet , lying by the roadside people gathered for a religious ceremony near the spot where @entity8 was shot down as shelling today forced international experts to abandon part of the crash scene @entity81 prime minister @entity254 said yesterday : ' the security situation at the site is unstable and unpredictable			2
' in clashes near the site of the drone crash , @entity5 said separatists killed at least 10 of its paratroopers in an ambush in the early hours of yesterday			0
a @entity5 military official said a further 13 troops were wounded and 11 unaccounted for			2
today , meanwhile , @entity22 accused the @entity265 of double standards , claiming it had lifted a ban on supplying @entity5 with military equipment ' on the quiet ' while imposing sanctions on @entity2 's military			0

the @entity318 has claimed the @entity265 is under the thumb of the @entity320 and called on @entity265 leaders not to be ' goaded ' by @entity322 over events in eastern @entity5			0
the @entity265 passed its heaviest penalties on @entity2 this week , imposing sanctions on @entity22 's defence , energy and financial sectors .			0
