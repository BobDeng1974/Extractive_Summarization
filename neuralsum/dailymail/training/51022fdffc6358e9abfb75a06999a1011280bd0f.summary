by @entity1 reporter published : 22:37 est , 4 june 2013 updated : 22:40 est , 4 june 2013 @entity3 's @entity2 has been slammed for being ' the technical equivalent of a polo shirt ' or a pair of @entity8 sneakers			1
tech writer @entity9 , a reformed @entity3 - lover , claims that after six years in existence , the popular smartphone is now anything but cool , but has instead become ' common			1
' ' and i mean that in the sense of " not distinguished ; not of superior excellence ; ordinary , " per definition 4 in my @entity15 : @entity18 , ' he writes , adding ' i 'll stop short of citing definition 7 : " not refined ; low ; coarse			2
" ' polo shirt : tech writer @entity9 , a reformed @entity3 - lover , claims the popular smartphone has become ' common ' in its six years in existence in an article in @entity23 , @entity9 , who recently switched to a @entity26 smartphone , said the @entity2 , independent of @entity3 , has become a brand unto itself			1
' ( switching from @entity3 has ) made it easier for me to recognize that the @entity2 is , in fact , a totally bourgeois device : the @entity2 has become , in its six short years , the technological equivalent of @entity20 , ' he writes			1
' ( the brand ) has long since crossed over from " cool " ( meaning something embraced by a minority that thinks of itself as having elite taste ) to " acceptable , " meaning it 's a sort of cultural default , like a @entity41 shirt or @entity8 sneakers			0
' he claims that the @entity2 is ' the brand for people who do n't want to think all that hard about what brand they are buying , and just want whatever everybody else will accept without question			2
' @entity9 's observations come after a @entity52 trade agency said it is banning imports of @entity3 's @entity2 after finding the device violates a patent held by rival @entity56			1
banned : the @entity2 , seen here on the right , along with the older model , the @entity58 on the left , can not be imported to the @entity52 anymore , a trade panel ruled tuesday because the phone is assembled in @entity65 , the import would end @entity3 's ability to sell new @entity2 4 devices in the @entity52 the @entity68 in @entity69 issued a final ruling on tuesday in @entity56 's suit against @entity3			1
the panel issued a limited import ban and a cease - and - desist order for @entity76 models of the @entity2 , @entity58 , @entity77 and @entity78			2
the versions targeted are more than a year old but still solid sellers , @entity79 reported			0
president @entity82 has 60 days to invalidate the order			0
@entity3 can also appeal the ruling			2
@entity56 and @entity3 are engaged in a global legal battle over their smartphones , with @entity3 arguing that @entity56 and its @entity88 phones copy vital features of the @entity2			1
@entity56 is fighting back with its own complaints			2
the @entity2 was launched in 2010 and is the oldest iphone still being made			0
it 's the second bad court ruling for @entity3 in as many weeks			0
not for sale : the ruling also states the @entity77 and @entity78 can not be imported as well because they violate a patent held by @entity56 a preliminary class settlement which agrees to pay $ 53 million in refunds to @entity2 and @entity98 customers for voiding their warranties was filed on tuesday by @entity3 in the @entity102 of @entity103 in @entity104			1
the settlement would refund up to $ 200 to each customer who was denied repairs or replacement under warranty of their @entity2 or @entity98 because a small red strip located on the outside of the device indicated that they had been in contact with water			0
@entity117 , an attorney representing two of the four representatives of the class action , told @entity121 that @entity3 refused to honor standard warranties and @entity123 if a white indicator strip near the headphone or charging jacks had turned pink or red			0
but 3m,the company that makes the strip ( called ' @entity130 ' ) said humidity alone could have caused the color of strips to turn pink or even red			0
this meant that a customer who took an @entity2 or @entity78 for repair would have their warranty voided if the liquid indicator strip was red - even if it had never been in contact with water .			0

@entity3 smartphone has become so *mainstream* it is no longer cool but bourgeois
@entity23 writer describes it as ' not distinguished ' and ' ordinary '
*criticism* comes as @entity2 models 4 and @entity58 are banned from being imported because the devices violate patents of rival @entity56
