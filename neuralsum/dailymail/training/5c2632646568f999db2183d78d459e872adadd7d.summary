‘ to put a man to the ground as three of you did and then to kick him as he lies on the ground is an exceedingly dangerous thing to do and people die because of it			2
‘ by sheer good fortune the injuries suffered by the victim of your attack were relatively slight and nothing like the injuries that they could have been			2
