she said : ‘ people shoot rabbits up there and it could be hugely bad luck that he has been shot twice by someone doing that			2
‘ but it ’s very suspect , especially as they got him right in the eye			2
if it was deliberate then it ’s a vile act			0

bad luck or a vile act ? owner @entity43 says people shoot rabbits in the area where @entity25 goes prowling so she is unsure whether it is extremely bad luck or a deliberate , ' vile act ' ‘ we will prosecute if we have evidence			1
in cases where we have the airgun pellet or bullet , we pass it to the police and they can match it to the gun and we have had successful prosecutions			1
’ the vet decided to leave the pellet found in @entity25 's chest as it was because it was not causing him any problems			0
