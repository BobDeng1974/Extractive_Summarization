a schoolboy who had his hair cut like football idol @entity2 has been ordered to wear a hat in lessons or stay home until it grows back , his family claim			1
ten - year - old @entity8 was told his short back and sides hairstyle , modelled on the @entity14 striker 's look , was too extreme by staff @entity16 's @entity15 in @entity17 , @entity18 , and he was removed from school on his birthday			1
his family say they were told he could either return to classes when his hair had grown , restyle it or wear a hat at all times			2
mr @entity8 said : ' @entity2 is his idol and he has had that haircut for six months			1
' he is being punished for a haircut but he has consistently achieved good results and is well behaved in class			0
' we were given three options - take him out of school until it grows , get it cut or sit in class wearing a hat and he wo n't be allowed to play football at school			0
he would also have to sit outside the headteacher 's office at break times wearing the hat			0
' we decided to keep him out of school because i am not having him sitting with the equivalent of a dunce 's hat on			1
' @entity8 's mother @entity37 , 39 , left , said she was not willing to send her son , centre , pictured alongside father @entity38 , right , to school if he had to wear the equivalent of ' a dunce 's cap ' or play football at break times but headteacher @entity75 said : ' we set clear standards on hair and dress at this school which parents are made fully aware of and accept when pupils enrol			1
' we always suggest that an unsuitable haircut can be trimmed into an acceptable style without going down the skinhead route or that the child can wear a hat of their choice in school			2
' if the parents wish to keep the child away from school until the haircut grows out we will ensure their education does not suffer			0
' it 's our responsibility to prepare children for high school , college , university and employment where they will be expected to follow the rules of the establishment or dress code of their employer			0
' we want our children to succeed and will continue to do all we can towards that aim			0

@entity8 , 10 , was told he had to **change** his new @entity2 haircut
the youngster wanted the same style as the @entity14 striker idol
staff at @entity117 's @entity15 in @entity18 said the cut was ' too extreme '
his parents were warned to either **change** the style or wear a hat in school
@entity8 's mother @entity37 said she was not making her son wear a ' dunce 's cap '
