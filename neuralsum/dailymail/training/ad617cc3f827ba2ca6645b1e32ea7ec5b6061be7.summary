can it be simpler than that ? ‘ i ’ve just said , he can pick any @entity48 who are available and i will take the rest			0

you will have to speak to him			0
’ the under 21 tournament begins on june 17 and is increasing in importance at the @entity67 following the country ’s disastrous showing at the @entity70 in @entity71			1
a number of @entity1 under 21 players have already expressed concern about the possibility of senior stars joining the squad and threatening the team spirit @entity2 has engineered			2
@entity2 could call upon a formidable central defence of @entity12 ( left ) and @entity11 hosts @entity7 , along with @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 have also qualified for the two - week tournament			1

‘ he will be under no pressure from me whatsoever			0
we can deal with four or five absentees			0
‘ we have two senior games in june and it also would mean that any senior players playing in the tournament in the @entity7 will be playing three tournaments in a row in the summer without a break			2
@entity117 striker @entity90 has starred for the @entity119 side this year ‘ the clubs ’ co-operation when it comes to selecting players is always important			2
as far as i understand , the @entity125 rules gives us the right to choose whatever players we want			0
‘ whether the clubs will be happy with us choosing them , that ’s another matter			0
but luckily it ’s not my choice			0
‘ i will have a choice after @entity2 ’s selection of the players i want to take to play against @entity137 and in @entity23			2
i can assure that we will have 11 players on the field on both occasions			0
