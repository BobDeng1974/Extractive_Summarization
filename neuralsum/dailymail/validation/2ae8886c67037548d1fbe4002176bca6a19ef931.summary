there was a time in 2012 when just about every selfie going was doctored by a grinning picture of @entity3 , super-imposed in his full @entity5 kit and lifting the @entity6			1
their captain popped up all over the internet , a subject of ridicule after missing the @entity6 final against @entity13 in the @entity14 through suspension			2
this time he wore the @entity5 strip for real , lifting the @entity17 high up in the @entity18 stands and dancing like a dad in front of their celebrating fans behind the goal in the @entity24			1
@entity3 lifts the @entity17 after captaining @entity5 to victory over @entity26 @entity28 goalkeeper @entity27 watches as @entity3 's shot finds the back of the net during the first half @entity33 , @entity3 and @entity34 celebrate the opening goal of the game in @entity37 @entity3 was man of the match here by a distance , driving this team towards their first trophy since @entity42 returned with a performance that sent shivers down the spine			1
he scored @entity5 ’s opener on the stroke of half - time , a finish that settled any anxiety and pretty much any doubt about the destination of this year ’s @entity17			1
after that , he was peerless			0
the @entity17 is a level or two down from the @entity6 , or the three @entity56 titles he has won at @entity5 during a 17 - year career at @entity58 — but one look at the @entity5 captain told you it really mattered			1
this was further confirmation , as if it were needed , of his class			0
his last - ditch tackle on @entity28 ’s talisman @entity65 , sprinting across to cover for his team - mate @entity34 in the final minutes here , evoked memories of the days when he was rated best in the world in his position			1
former @entity70 forward @entity33 had a hand in the second goal of the game on sunday afternoon @entity5 manager @entity42 and @entity28 boss @entity74 watch on from the sidelines @entity76 celebrates with @entity33 during their @entity17 final win in @entity37 it hurt like hell for @entity3 to miss out on the @entity6 final , that one night in @entity82 when @entity5 finally realised their ambition to win the biggest club cup in @entity86 football			1
at the age of 34 he plays one season at a time now , waiting for the call from @entity5 technical director @entity90 or director @entity91 to tell him that he will be staying on for another campaign			2
that conversation is coming , ‘ a formality ’ according to @entity42 recently as @entity3 matured into a new role at the heart of the @entity5 defence			1
@entity100 as it sounds , opposition managers and their players have yet to suss out that @entity3 has passed on the main responsibility of marking to his usual central defensive partner @entity34			2
that savvy move added another five years to @entity107 ’s career with @entity108 when it was put to him by @entity109 at the turn of the millennium			0
here , after lifting the first trophy since @entity42 returned to @entity58 , @entity3 played like he could go on for another thousand years			2
@entity3 slides in to block a shot from @entity28 's top scorer @entity65 during the second half @entity42 has been instrumental in @entity3 's return to form , inspiring new motivation in his captain fellow defender @entity34 has taken over many of the marking duties that @entity3 used to perform himself @entity65 went cold here , frozen out by the discipline of @entity34 — comfortably his best performance of the season — and the organisational ability of @entity5 ’s captain alongside him			1
@entity34 was terrorised by @entity65 in the 5 - 3 defeat at @entity129 on january 1 , roughed up by the @entity28 striker and losing his guaranteed place in @entity5 ’s team as a result			1
@entity3 is talking this team through games , just as @entity136 did when he returned to @entity58 after winning the @entity137 with @entity138 in 1998			0
@entity3 has matured these past couple of years and it is at times like this when you begin to wonder what else he could have achieved if he had kept his nose clean			0
the rehabilitation will never quite be complete , never quite final because he has never spoken about the day in 2011 when he racially insulted @entity146			0
he really ought to speak about it because even if the words he used at @entity149 that day are unacceptable , society will accept an apology , or a least an explanation			0
football can be a forgiving place			0
the @entity5 squad celebrate their cup success following the final whistle in the capital @entity159 , @entity3 and full back @entity160 celebrate their first trophy since @entity42 's return @entity5 's captain and manager embrace after the @entity168 coach 's first trophy since 2012 @entity5 supporters see him differently , in awe as he added to his collection of trophies by hauling his team towards their first major honour of the new @entity42 era			1
this was a reminder of days gone by , taking those familiar with his career back to his goal for @entity181 in this stadium when he rose into the night sky to head home a @entity186 cross against @entity187 in 2007			0
those days are a distant memory and even @entity181 manager @entity191 , admiring this performance from the stands , accepts that @entity3 will never play for the national side again			0
everybody has moved on , and rightly so			0
he has played at the highest level and yet he reached new heights here , leading his team up the @entity18 staircase and leading the celebrations when he collected the trophy			0
dressed head to toe in @entity5 ’s blue strip , @entity3 would n’t have it any other way .			2

@entity5 beat @entity28 2 - 0 in the @entity17 final
@entity3 scored the opening goal , @entity33 had a hand in the second
@entity3 has seen a return to form since @entity42 rejoined the club
the @entity216 ' captain has *redefined* his game to involve more *delegation*
