by @entity0 when a firework exploded in @entity3 ’s face , he was blinded in one eye and doctors feared he would not survive			1
the 54 - year - old from @entity7 near @entity8 thought his life would never be the same , but years of pioneering plastic surgery has seen him get his looks back			1
in 2008 , mr @entity3 was learning how to put on a fireworks display at a wedding , but the man teaching him , @entity14 , was uninsured and unqualified			1
before : @entity3 , 54 , from @entity7 near @entity8 , was left with a series of horrific burn marks on his face after a professional display firework exploded in his face when the professional display mortar went off - without the planned time delay - he was rushed to @entity22 , and surgeons doubted whether he would survive the night			1
he was not wearing goggles , ear defenders or gloves when he lit the fuse and he immediately hit the floor			0
but he managed to pull through , and six years after the ordeal has made significant progress			2
in the early stages of his treatment , mr @entity3 's injuries were so severe that mirrors in hospital and home were initially covered up to prevent him seeing the extent of his disfigurement			1
despite still being blind in one eye , reconstructive surgery has transformed his life			0
in the split second of the accident , his skin had been effectively tattooed by hundreds of black burning sparks			1
eight sessions of more traditional laser therapy did not remove them			0
but @entity49 , a clinical fellow at @entity51 , and consultant @entity52 , used punch biopsies - which puncture small holes in the skin - to remove the minute marks			1
they removed up to 80 marks in a session			2
normally , punch biopsies are used for one or two marks - for example , to remove tumours			1
but the idea of using them on such a large scale is now being talked about by plastic surgeons all over the world			1
miss @entity49 , who worked on mr @entity3 , has released a research paper about it , and is flying to the @entity71 to present the idea there			1
it could be used in the future to help other victims of blast injuries , including soldiers			0
after : a series of specialist procedures performed by surgeons at @entity81 called punch biopsys have seen most of the marks removed a punch biopsy is done with a circular blade ranging in size from 1mm to 8mm			1
the blade is attached to a pencil - shaped instrument and is rotated down , piercing the outer layer of the skin			0
samples can be taken from almost anywhere , including lungs , kidney , liver and stomach			0
usually , it is used for taking small samples of skin to send to a pathologist for testing and is rarely used to remove skin			0
normally only one or two marks are removed in a session , but mr @entity3 had around 80 taken off			1
plastic surgeons all over the world are now talking about using the procedure on a large scale			1
mr @entity3 said : ‘ when the accident first happened , i did n’t think my life would ever be the same			2
i did n’t think i would work , or go on holiday or anything - the first two years were very grim			2
‘ but now it is truly a transformation			0
the surgeons have changed my life and my face looks incredible by comparison			2
‘ punch biopsies have never been used like this before			1
‘ i have had about 24 procedures in all , everything from putting a titanium plate into my eye to make it the right shape , to burning my eyelashes off because they were growing the wrong way			0
it ’s all been rebuilt			0
‘ the most amazing one was the titanium			0
that kind of procedure used to take hours in theatre while they put the metal together , but they used a scan to make a resin model of my head , and built the eye plate on there			0
‘ then all they had to do was make a slit in my skin and slide it in , which frees up surgery time and saves thousands			0
' the last of the surgery finished last year , and saw mr @entity3 having his eyelids rebuilt from skin grafts at @entity150 , as well as the end of his nose and corner of his lip being put back onto his face			1
mr @entity3 and his wife , @entity156 , run a wholesale tea and coffee business			2
he is left with a constant headache due to nerve damage , which he manages with painkillers , and his treatment is ongoing			0
he said : ‘ i was honoured to get this treatment			0
it ’s going to go global , and i am so glad someone else wo n’t have to suffer as much , thanks to what they managed to achieve with me			0
‘ @entity8 is so lucky to have a world - class plastics facility here			2
’ @entity14 was given a nine - month suspended prison sentence after the incident			0
he was ordered to pay mr @entity3 £ 50,000 in compensation and was banned from organising a fireworks display for two years			1
pioneering : mr @entity3 had around 24 procedures performed on him by specialists at the @entity150			2

a professional display mortar exploded in @entity3 's face in 2008
doctors at @entity22 , @entity8 , feared he would not survive the night
face was effectively tattooed with hundreds of black burn marks
six years on his face has been reconstructed using punch biopsies
procedure has never been used on such a large scale before
