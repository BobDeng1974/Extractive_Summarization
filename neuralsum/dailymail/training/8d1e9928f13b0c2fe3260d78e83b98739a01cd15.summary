by @entity0 published : 08:30 est , 21 october 2013 updated : 09:34 est , 21 october 2013 divorce battle : former city trader @entity2 outside @entity4 's appeal court where he claimed he was ' bust ' despite being a major shareholder of £ 5m - a - year business a former @entity9 trader locked in a bitter divorce battle today told a judge that he was not ' rich ' despite being a major shareholder of a £ 5million - a - year business and owning a £ 2million apartment			1
@entity2 , 43 - whose spending power was described by a family judge just three months ago as ' beyond the wildest dreams ' of his estranged wife - insisted in @entity4 's @entity19 that he was ' bust '			1
mr @entity2 , who is believed to be @entity21 , said he was labouring under enormous debts , adding : ' yes i own a $ 3.3m ( £ 2million ) apartment - it does n’t mean i 'm rich			1
' mr @entity2 and his ex-wife @entity26 , 44 , met and married in @entity4 while he worked in the @entity9 for @entity27 and @entity28			1
they raised their two children - @entity30 , now a model , and @entity33 - in the capital before splitting in 2007 and departing for different parts of the @entity36 in 2009			0
however mrs @entity26 , a fashion writer who owns a ranch in @entity38 , and her ex-husband , whose home is a $ 3.3million ( £ 2million ) condo in one of @entity44 ’s most iconic areas , turned to the @entity46 courts to decide how the family wealth should be divided			1
mr @entity2 told @entity48 that despite his ex-wife being awarded $ 1.1m worth of assets in 2011 - in addition to him being ordered to pay her $ 180,000 - a - year in maintenance , plus $ 50,000 - a - year to pay for their children ’s education - the financial battle between the couple is far from over			1
a final court show - down to assess and divide their wealth is pending and , in july , judge @entity59 ordered that mr @entity2 pay £ 235,000 towards his ex-wife ’s legal costs bills in the run - up to that hearing			1
the banker asked @entity48 to overturn that order , telling him : ' my recent income has dropped considerably - i do n’t have any money			1
' judge @entity59 , sitting at the @entity74 and @entity73 in july , awarded the payment towards the wife ’s costs , after ruling on a dispute between the former spouses over the amount of personal wealth each of them controls			2
protracted dispute : mr @entity2 's ex-wife @entity26 , right , with their model daughter @entity30 in his ruling , the judge said of mr @entity2 : ' the husband has been able to acquire a $ 3.3m apartment in @entity91			1
this kind of spending ability is not within the wife ’s reach , not within her wildest dreams			1
' of mrs @entity26 , he added : ' she is a well - educated woman , with a first and masters degree and journalistic experience , ' going on to say that her earning capacity was far outweighed by that of her husband			2
mr @entity2 , representing himself , told the @entity19 : ' @entity103 ordered me to pay large sums in legal fees to my wife ... ( he was ) wrong to make such an order '			1
of his multi-million dollar business he added : ' speculation that a turnover of $ 8m would automatically translate to a large income for myself , because i own 50 % of the company , is just wrong			0
' he is making a mistake ... i am currently acting in person because my recent income has dropped considerably			1
i can no longer afford a solicitor ... what is in the past is almost irrelevant			0
' mrs @entity26 was awarded $ 1.1m worth of assets in 2011 in addition to $ 180,000 - a - year in maintenance plus $ 50,000 - a - year for their children 's education putting a question to mr @entity2 on the current state of his business , @entity48 asked : ' did your barrister say it ’s all gone bust ? ' ' yes he did , ' the banker replied , adding : ' the house has no equity - the house belongs to the banks			1
i own an apartment worth $ 3.3m - it does n’t mean i ’m rich			2
' insisting that the £ 235,000 costs payment was effectively an ' increase in maintenance ' for his ex-wife , he concluded : ' the point is , i do n’t have this money			1
' ' it is far above my income			0
i do n’t have any capacity for borrowing			0
i already have a huge amount of debt			0
i do n’t have any money			0
' @entity48 , however , said , ' the judge did n’t believe that and thought you were much better off			0
the @entity157 can not disturb the findings as to who is believed and who is not '			0
before @entity103 ' the parties financial positions were very much in dispute , ' but mr @entity2 now insisted ' that he is much worse off than the judge believed			2
' turning to his financial situation , @entity48 said : ' you are the majority shareholder and you set the company up			0
' when the judge says you have an apartment in @entity91 worth $ 3.3m , and a company with a recent turnover of $ 8m , he is saying that the company could afford to pay you more			2
he is saying you could afford to pay yourself more			0
' refusing permission to appeal , he added : ' the judge in my view was entitled to take the view that mr @entity2 ... was prosperous and would have sufficient finances to provide not only for his own , but also for his wife ’s , legal expenses			2
' there may be arguments to be made as to the comparative means of the parties , but it seems to me that the most disruptive thing would be the postponement of the ( pending ) @entity188 hearing			0
' the forthcoming hearing provides the best opportunity for the truth as to the husband and wife ’s comparative assets to be revealed			0
' if it should turn out that this man does not have £ 250,000 to pay the sum ordered , then the wife will have to give credit for that and it would count heavily against her			2
woe betide the wife if the basis upon which she obtained this substantial order turns out to be false , ' he concluded			0
mrs @entity26 did not attend the @entity19 hearing and was not represented .			0

@entity2 *contesting* how much he must pay to ex-wife @entity26
