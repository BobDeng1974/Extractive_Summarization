he eats up to 15 per cent of his bodyweight while training for competitions , including colossal portions of hotdogs , fried asparagus and frozen yoghurt			1
but despite his incredible achievements , mr @entity5 weighs a tiny 126lbs and is studying to become a dietician , something he admits is ' fairly contradictory '			1
the nutrition major is now the youngest competitor on the @entity42 circuit after competing professionally for four years			0
mr @entity5 , who is currently training for the world 's biggest food challenge - @entity45 eating competition in @entity47 , @entity48 - today described his hobby as ' hard work '			1
getting stuck in : mr @entity5 is pictured ( right ) at a previous @entity45 eating competition in @entity48 getting full : despite his incredible achievements , mr @entity5 weighs a tiny 126lbs and is studying to become a dietician , something he admits is ' fairly contradictory '			1
above , mr @entity5 swallows hot dogs during the contest ' it 's all about a strict diet and training regime to keep the weight off , ' he said			1
' when i 'm competing , or even just training , i can eat nearly 10 - 15 per cent of my bodyweight in food and liquids , so i 've had to tailor my normal diet to cope with that			1
competitive eaters usually undergo rigorous training in the weeks - or months - leading up to competitions			2
this involves eating colossal amounts of food over a short period of time , as well as drinking large quantities of water to increase their stomach capacity			0
although widely popular in @entity1 , @entity78 and @entity79 , the ' sport ' has been criticised for its potential health risks			0
some medics claim it can cause weight gain - leading to high cholesterol and blood pressure - while others argue it can cause stomach paralysis , indigestion and choking			0
in october 2012 , a 32 - year - old man choked to death while competitively consuming live cockroaches in @entity93			0
competitive eating has also been condemned for the message it sends to children as obesity levels soar in the @entity1 and @entity99			0
' when i 'm seriously training , i go to the gym about five times a week and have to skip meals with friends and family to stick to my schedule and keep my weight down			0
' mr @entity5 said he often uses the @entity109 challenge to increase his stomach capacity in the weeks leading up to competitions			1
the challenge involves consuming the @entity114 swimmers ' daily calories - a whopping 12,590 - in one sitting			0
despite the seemingly impossible task , he regularly finishes of all the food - including two trays of pasta , a family - size pizza and five - egg omelette - in just over 40 minutes			2
mr @entity5 said his nutrition studies had helped him to balance out the side - effects of taking in so much sugar , salt and fat in such a short time , which include massive sugar crashes			2
' the crashes can be really severe - like drinking too much coffee at night , ' he said			0
' fortunately , sugar is usually easier to deal with digestion wise rather than fatty or high protein meals			0
' i started to study nutrition to help understand how the body deals with that amount of food			0
' it 's fairly contradictory to be studying towards becoming a dietician , but has helped me a lot with staying healthy throughout all this eating			2
' rivals : the nutrition major ( left ) with two other competitors at a deep fried asparagus eating competition since winning the first competition he entered in 2010 - a lobster roll eating challenge with a top prize of $ 600 - mr @entity5 has earned $ 46,00 , ranking him as the second best in the world			1
in the last four years , he has competed all over the @entity1 , as well as travelling to @entity154 and @entity155 , as he builds up a heated rivalry with the world number one , @entity158			0
mr @entity5 said he had first realised he had a talent for consuming huge portions of food at the age of 18 , when he had managed to complete a 5lb burrito challenge in just 15 minutes			1
dedicated to the ' sport ' : mr @entity5 ( pictured ) today described his passion for competitive eating as ' hard work ' ' i used to watch @entity169 , and think " i could whip that guy " so it sparked my interest and led me to enter my 1st eating contest - lobster roll eating , ' he said			1
' amazingly , i won against a seasoned competitor , so i got addicted to everything - the competition , the adrenaline , the crowd ' i loved everything about it and , to an 18 year old kid , starting college , getting $ 600 for only 10 minutes of eating was unbelievable			2
