by @entity0 a horse sparked a seven - hour rescue operation after it fell down a 10ft hole and into an underground chamber where it was stuck for 24 hours			1
the 14 - year - old animal , called @entity7 , was in its field in @entity9 , @entity10 , when it trod on some loose boards covering the hole , and is thought to have toppled backwards into it			1
she then spent the night underground after firefighters assessed her , returning the following day with specialist equipment to dig her out in a rescue mission lasting around seven - and - a - half hours			1
crews , who arrived at the scene at around 2.30pm yesterday , wanted to dig deep enough to enable the horse to walk free from the underground cave			1
@entity45 , her mother @entity42 and daughter @entity42 own @entity7 , and said they were amazed she was not seriously injured in the fall			2
drilling : the specialist fire crew from nearby @entity30 , assisted by another crew , drilled through the 2ft thick concrete walls of the chamber using circular saws and jackhammers trapped : @entity7 was trapped inside this underground concrete bunker for 24 hours fears : @entity30 watch commander @entity54 said the rescue mission was originally deemed to have been too dangerous , and that crews considered if it was more humane to put the animal to sleep ' i ca n't believe @entity7 has only suffered superficial cuts and grazes , ' said ms @entity45			1
' how she got down there i 've no idea			0
the hole was covered up with flags and has just given way - we had no idea that was there			0
' it looks like @entity7 has gone down backwards and tried to scramble out with her front legs			2
the firefighters have been fantastic - they have been digging all afternoon			0
' she could not have been dragged out without being anaesthetised which is why we need to dig her out			0
' @entity30 watch commander @entity54 said the rescue mission was originally deemed to have been too dangerous , and that crews considered if it was more humane to put the animal to sleep			2
escape route : crews , who arrived at the scene at around 2.30pm yesterday , wanted to dig deep enough to enable the horse to walk free from the underground cave free at last : @entity7 is led out of her concrete prison and back into the fresh air however , the field 's owner then arrived just in time , and used a @entity88 to help dig a hole down the side of the chamber , removing around 80 tonnes of earth allowing the fire crews access			1
' we had just started telling the horse owner the bad news and then one of the team came up with this idea and we went for it , ' mr @entity54 told local paper the @entity101			0
' the incident was reported to us at lunchtime and we had four large fire service technical rescue vehicles and 12 staff involved			0
' after hours of hard work the horse finally came out at 9pm to rapturous applause from the 150 - strong crowd who had gathered to watch			0
it had a slight limp on one of its back legs but was otherwise unharmed by its ordeal			0
' freedom : @entity7 was eventually freed after the field 's owner arrived and helped to dig 80 tonnes of earth away from the chamber , allowing fire crews access safe and sound : @entity7 escaped her overnight ordeal with just a few cuts and bruises			1
