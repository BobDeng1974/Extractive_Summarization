presumably because he wanted to control both @entity26 and the situation			0
' somehow he was very ' @entity5 ' , writing down everything in a very correct and precise way – even if what he recorded was deeply personal and often emotional fraught			1

' the archive also tells us a lot about the dynamics between men and women at the time : he is older , her boss , wealthy ; she is his secretary , younger , pretty , full of cliches			2
