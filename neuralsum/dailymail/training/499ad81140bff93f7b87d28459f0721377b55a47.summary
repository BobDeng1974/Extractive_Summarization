twelve months on @entity2 shows no signs of slowing down despite the hamstring problems which disrupted the end of his campaign			2
' last year we did the same and now this year too			0
' it is nice to score goals but for me the most important thing is the team wins but i am happy i scored and helped the team win			2
' our team is a great team , it is really important to achieve great things and i am really happy to be here			0
' @entity2 scored in the first minute - after just 35 seconds - and the last , in between which were sandwiched efforts from @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 in addition to a @entity58 own goal			1
@entity60 , @entity61 and , against the club he left in the summer , @entity59 made it 2 - 1 , 3 - 2 and 4 - 3 respectively but @entity5 always just kept one step ahead			1
' it was nice to score my first goal ( for the club ) because on this ground it is always difficult , although the most important thing is we got three points , ' said midfielder @entity54			0
solid return : @entity2 's opening three @entity72 matches have brought four goals ' this season we play better , we have more goals in us , we are more confident in attack - we scored six goals which is not easy			1
' it was very good for people who bought tickets for the game as they saw nine goals , which is good for football and the @entity72			1
' if every game was like this i 'd be happy but the coach will show us where we made mistakes			0
' the coach in question , @entity30 , has many examples to show them on monday morning after expressing his dissatisfaction with how they defended			0
but he also gave them some credit for the way they attacked clinically			0
' we have scored nine goals in two @entity72 games against teams in the top five last season , ' he said			1
opened account : midfielder @entity54 celebrates his first goal in a @entity5 shirt ' the quality of our football was fantastic : every time we had the ball we were aggressive			1
' i prefer to win 6 - 0 playing fantastic football , defensively and offensively , but i want the team to play the way we did , i want them to be positive but not make defensive mistakes			1
' @entity16 manager @entity115 will have a whole dvd of errors to show his shell - shocked squad with their defensive confidence in tatters after conceding 10 goals in three matches			1
the @entity124 admits fear has crept into their game and he will have to work hard to stop it			2
' we started the game very uncharacteristically for us , ' he said			0
' we did n't have that defensive intensity and focus you have to have , especially with a team like @entity5 , and then we were chasing the game			2
not totally impressed : @entity30 took issue with his @entity5 side 's defending at @entity136 unfocussed : @entity115 said @entity16 lacked intensity at the start and had to chase the game ' we were very good going forward , i do n't think there will be many teams who will score three goals against @entity5 this season , but we were too soft with our defending			1
' every time the ball was around our 18 - yard box we had a real fear of it ending up in our net			2
' we now have conceded in three games and that is not like us at all			0
we kept 15 clean sheets last campaign			0
' we need to work and focus			0
it is not the technicality of conceding goals , it is the feeling			0
' that is something we need to change			0
our attacking play was phenomenal and we need to bring that confidence into our defensive play			0
