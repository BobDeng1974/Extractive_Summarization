by @entity1 reporter published : 09:00 est , 9 october 2012 updated : 07:21 est , 10 october 2012 scientists have discovered a huge black hole lurking near the centre of our own galaxy thanks to a rare phenomenon which broadcast its presence with a torrent of high - energy x-rays			1
@entity13 's @entity12 satellite detected the rising surge of x-rays , produced by a rare x-ray nova , last month and say it is evidence of a black hole that is part of a binary system near the @entity20 's core			1
' @entity22 novae are so rare that they 're essentially once - a - mission events and this is the first one @entity12 has seen , ' said @entity24 , the mission 's principal investigator			2
' this is really something we 've been waiting for			0
this image is from september 18 , 2012 when the source peaked in hard x-rays an x-ray nova is a short - lived x-ray source that appears suddenly , reaches its emission peak in a few days and then fades out over a period of months			0
the outburst arises when a torrent of stored gas suddenly rushes toward one an incredibly dense and compact object , either a neutron star or a black hole			1
the rapidly brightening source triggered @entity12 's @entity53 twice on the morning of september 16 , and once again the next day			2
named @entity58 after the coordinates of its sky position , the nova is located a few degrees from the centre of our galaxy toward the constellation @entity64			0
while astronomers do not know its precise distance , they think the object resides about 20,000 to 30,000 light - years away in the galaxy 's inner region			2
a black hole is a region of space - time where gravity prevents anything , including light , from escaping			1
the theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass will deform spacetime to form a black hole			1
around a black hole there is a mathematically defined surface called an event horizon that marks the point of no return			1
it is called ' black ' because it absorbs all the light that hits the horizon , reflecting nothing , just like a perfect black body in thermodynamics			0
quantum mechanics predicts that black holes emit radiation like a black body with a finite temperature			0
this temperature is inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole , making it difficult to observe this radiation for black holes of stellar mass or greater			1
black holes of stellar mass are expected to form when very massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle			0
after a black hole has formed it can continue to grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings			1
by absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes , supermassive black holes of millions of solar masses may form			0
there is general consensus that supermassive black holes exist in the centres of most galaxies			0
ground - based observatories detected infrared and radio emissions , but thick clouds of obscuring dust have prevented astronomers from catching @entity58 - 26 in visible light			0
the nova peaked in hard x-rays - energies above 10,000 electron volts , or several thousand times that of visible light - on september 18 , when it reached an intensity equivalent to that of the famous @entity136 that nebula is a supernova remnant that serves as a calibration target for high - energy observatories and is considered one of the brightest sources beyond the solar system at these energies			0
even as it dimmed at higher energies , the nova brightened in the lower - energy , or softer , emissions detected by @entity12 's @entity149 , a behavior typical of x-ray novae			2
by wednesday , @entity58 was 30 times brighter in soft x-rays than when it was discovered and it continued to brighten			0
' the pattern we 're seeing is observed in x-ray novae where the central object is a black hole			1
once the x-rays fade away , we hope to measure its mass and confirm its black hole status , ' said @entity163 , an astrophysicist at @entity164 in @entity165 , who currently is working with other @entity12 team members at @entity168			1
the black hole must be a member of a low - mass x-ray binary ( @entity172 ) system , which includes a normal , sun - like star			1
a stream of gas flows from the normal star and enters into a storage disk around the black hole			1
in most @entity180 , the gas in the disk spirals inward , heats up as it heads toward the black hole , and produces a steady stream of x-rays			2
but under certain conditions , stable flow within the disk depends on the rate of matter flowing into it from the companion star			0
at certain rates , the disk fails to maintain a steady internal flow and instead flips between two dramatically different conditions - a cooler , less ionized state where gas simply collects in the outer portion of the disk like water behind a dam , and a hotter , more ionized state that sends a tidal wave of gas surging toward the centre			0
' each outburst clears out the inner disk , and with little or no matter falling toward the black hole , the system ceases to be a bright source of x-rays , ' said @entity209 , a @entity210 astrophysicist			1
' decades later , after enough gas has accumulated in the outer disk , it switches again to its hot state and sends a deluge of gas toward the black hole , resulting in a new x-ray outburst			2
' this phenomenon , called the thermal - viscous limit cycle , helps astronomers explain transient outbursts across a wide range of systems , from protoplanetary disks around young stars , to dwarf novae - where the central object is a white dwarf star - and even bright emission from supermassive black holes in the hearts of distant galaxies .			0

black hole was discovered by @entity13 's @entity12 satellite last month
scientists believe it is part of a binary system near *galactic* core
