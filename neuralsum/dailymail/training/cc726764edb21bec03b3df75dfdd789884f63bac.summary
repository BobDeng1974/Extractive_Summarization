by @entity0 one of the joys of this golfing season has been the thursday masterclass from @entity3 and the one delivered at @entity4 in the opening round of the @entity6 was surely the best yet			1
this one , delivered over one of @entity10 ’s finest links courses , was so good it surely laid to rest any idea he still possesses shortcomings when it comes to this venerable form of the game			2
and so alongside the 63s delivered at the @entity18 course in @entity19 and @entity20 in @entity21 in february , and @entity22 in @entity23 in may , comes a new course record 64 and a consummate demonstration of all he has learned since he vented his frustration over links golf after being blown away at @entity29 ’s in 2011			1
reward : @entity3 poses with the @entity31 for may in @entity4 now watch this drive : @entity3 hits off the tee during day one of the @entity6 what a view : @entity3 , @entity35 and @entity36 approach the 17th green during the first round ‘ it ’s obviously not my natural style of golf but i am determined to make it my favourite for two weeks every year , ’ was the wry verdict of the 25 year old			1
the highlight was undoubtedly the wind - assisted drive at the par four 13th , struck so hard and true it trickled on to the green fully 436 yards away			0
@entity48 was putting at the time			0
‘ i only hit a three wood as well , ’ said @entity3 to @entity49 jokingly , after the sheepish apology			1
yet it was the shots played into the wind that were really the most impressive			0
we all know how far @entity3 can hit it when he opens his shoulders			1
but here as well were the cut - down shots that you need to win @entity6 and open titles			1
a gorgeous four iron at the par three seventh , for example , that only flew 160 yards – fully 70 yards less than @entity3 normally carries the ball through the air with that club			1
at the fifth he hit an eight iron that only travelled 120 yards , as against the more normal 170 yards			0
it might not be his favoured form of golf but @entity3 is so good he still has a prized collection of low scores on links courses			1
a scarcely - credible 61 at @entity75 , for example , and a 63 at @entity77			0
‘ given how hard the front nine was playing , i ’d definitely rate it right up there , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ i ca n’t remember shooting this low before on a links when the wind was this strong			2
’ still , nobody will be thinking of handing him the trophy just yet			0
the other thing that binds those masterclasses together is they have invariably been followed by friday horror shows , most notably with a 78 at @entity22			2
that one was so bad it drew a raised eyebrow from tournament host @entity92			0
when the pair met for lunch a week later , it was still on the great man ’s mind			0
‘ how do you go from a 63 to a 78 ? ’ the @entity92 good - naturedly enquired			2
personal best : the @entity102 ranks the round as one of the best he 's played on a links course @entity106 to learn new course - @entity3 in fact , it was part of a curious run on fridays that saw @entity3 shoot 40 or more for nine holes for four straight events on the @entity114 and five out of six tournaments			1
‘ i think it ’s more mental than anything , just focusing too much on where i am on the leaderboard rather than going out and trying to play another solid round of golf , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ so that ’s what i will be trying to do here in the second round			2
’ @entity125 , who leads by a shot from @entity129 early bird @entity127 – he was first man out at 6 - 30am – was n’t the only big name to show up on the leaderboard			0
not going so well ? @entity48 puts his head in his hands during the first round in @entity4 @entity135 - ing good : @entity137 @entity136 drives off the fourth tee on his way to an opening round of 67 defending champion @entity141 might have three - putted the 18th but a 68 still represented a solid start to his big fortnight , while his playing partner @entity136 edged him with a 67			1
@entity141 was typically good value , with an eagle three at the sixth and then an outrageous birdie at the 13th , after his drive finished on a paved path			1
a free drop was on offer but doing that would be boring , would n’t it ? so @entity141 played a sand wedge approach off the path to 8ft and rolled in the birdie putt			1
the @entity158 ’s woes this year have been mainly to do with poor putting , and he was encouraged with his work in that department			0
‘ i was pleased with the way i putted , ’ he said			0
‘ even though i three putted the last , it was much better			0
it was a good round			1
’ rough spot : @entity165 finds himself in trouble on the 13th as his ball ends up in the long grass reigning champion : @entity141 tees off at the third hole as he looks to retain his title this event is the start of a busy run for the stars , with most playing eight out of the next ten events before a week off and then the @entity177			1
‘ what i ’m looking for from these events is to build up some momentum , ’ said @entity136			2
‘ it ’s been what i would call a choppy season to this point , with some good weeks but some poor ones			2
i need to shoot some low scores , so i can build up a head of steam			0
’ a four under par bogey - free round certainly represented a start in the right direction for the runaway winner of this event in 2011			0
the players out in the morning had the best of the conditions , as the greens dried out and the wind changed direction			0
@entity201 shot a fine 69 but @entity48 and @entity202 both laboured , as they carded scores of 73 and 72 respectively			0
@entity158 @entity204 shot 71 while sir @entity205 , making a rare tournament appearance a week shy of his 57th birthday , shot a creditable 73			0
@entity208 is ready for @entity6			2

@entity3 shoots opening round of 64 at @entity6
@entity102 's round set new course record at @entity4
@entity141 and @entity136 also in strong positions after good scores
@entity102 has vowed not to follow up with a poor round on friday
