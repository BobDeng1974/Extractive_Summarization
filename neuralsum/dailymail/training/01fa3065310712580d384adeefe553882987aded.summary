the massive @entity6 found the pesky bee too much to bear as it buzzes around his head just out of reach			1
this incredible comedic moment was captured by an amateur photographer who was visiting the bear den at @entity14			2
buzz off : the @entity16 the @entity6 bear snarls irritably at the bee which is zipping around his nose , just out of striking distance @entity20 from @entity21 , @entity22 , saw this incredible sight on one of her regular visits to her local zoo			1
mrs @entity29 's husband bought the 67 - year - old a camera in 1999 and she has been taking stunning photos ever since			0
she said : ' i found the zoo 's handsome @entity6 bear named @entity16 sitting there surrounded by a number of those pesky little summer bees that annoy everyone at picnics			1
you 're getting right up my nose : the bear sneezes after the the insect persistently hovers in front of its face ' he was n't taking his eyes off those little critters for one second , i thought for sure one of them was going to either fly in his mouth or up his nose			2
' i felt bad for him but at the same time he was making such cute , comical gestures that he made me smile			0
' i could n't wait to get home to see what i had captured when i was done , which to me is half the fun of photography , that pesky bee made my day			0
' not happy : @entity16 , a resident of @entity21 zoo , looked down in the dumps after being disturbed by the flying critter			0

@entity16 the @entity6 bear was *enjoying* a *peaceful* *afternoon* at @entity14 , @entity22
but a busy bee took a shine to the huge beast and began to fly around his face
the *exasperated* grizzly was so irritated he tried *blowing* and sneezing at the critter
