reputed to be the world ’s richest chef with a personal fortune of £ 150 million , mr @entity1 launched his ‘ @entity14 ’ food range amid great fanfare two years ago			1
the collection of sauces , biscuits and jams were said to be a ground - breaking collaboration between the tv cook and a hand - picked group of independent , small - scale food producers in @entity24 and @entity25			2
but despite being stocked in over 150 retailers , poor sales have left @entity28 owing parent group @entity1 £ 14 million – some £ 6 million of which is unlikely to be repaid			1
@entity28 made losses of £ 3.8 million in 2012 , double its deficit of £ 1.9 million the year before			1
mr @entity1 is to discontinue the range by the end of the year			1
suppliers and wholesalers confirmed they were sent an email informing them the line was ending , leading some producers to attack @entity28 ’s ‘ commercial ineptitude ’ and ‘ poor branding ’			1
one producer claims he is still owed money by @entity28 and said his final dealings with the business had left a ‘ sour taste ’ in his mouth			1
‘ we had a lot of difficulties with them , ’ said @entity48 , of shortbread bakers reids of @entity50			0
‘ i ’m not going to be harsh on @entity1 because the failure is down to his team			2
i ’m still sitting on about £ 1,000 of packaging they wanted that i ’ll never get reimbursed for			2
’ mr @entity48 accused the chef ’s business associates of being ‘ unprofessional ’ and described many of the decisions made by those in charge of the @entity14 brand as ‘ commercial madness ’			1
‘ to be honest , i ’m not surprised the range has been cut , ’ he added			2
‘ it turned out to be a really poor business			0
many of their buyers ignored top - quality importers who wanted to take our products on abroad			0
‘ it ’s such a shame because the brand had such potential			0
i ’ve been so furious about it			0
‘ we made some money from it , but we ’ve also lost money from it			0
it ’s not good when high - profile brands are doing that to small businesses			0
’ another supplier , who preferred to remain anonymous said : ‘ i ’m not surprised at all the range did not do well			0
they had no idea about the commercial world			0
by the end i was pulling my hair out			0
’ discontinued : a range of products from @entity98 - which made significant losses and will be discontinued by the end of the year the group is also to withdraw @entity28 homeware from stores , although the products will still be marketed through direct selling parties in individuals ’ homes , and online			1
a spokesman for mr @entity1 last night confirmed that the foods range would be discontinued from 2014 , but added : ‘ the food was always a very small part of what the @entity14 range offers			1
‘ it was decided the focus should be on the bigger , more successful , homewares range sold through direct selling and online			0
‘ we are not aware of owing any suppliers money but if they would like to approach us directly as opposed to through the media , the @entity14 team will investigate			2
