@entity2 manager @entity1 said at a press conference at @entity10 ’s @entity9 today that chief executive @entity11 is still in touch with the @entity14 club about @entity4 after submitting a second bid thought to be in excess of £ 30million , which would be a new club record			1
he said : ' my understanding is that @entity11 's had a response and he 's spoken with them [ @entity7 ] and again we 've made a second offer			1
but @entity11 's dealing with that , rather than me personally here			2
' determined : @entity1 is eager to strengthen his midfield before the season begins top target : @entity1 is refusing to give up on @entity4 at @entity7 @entity2 could be forced to break their record transfer fee if they are to lure @entity4 to @entity28			1
here 's the list of 10 previous records at the club			0
@entity32 - £ 30.75m from @entity33 , september 2008 @entity34 - £ 29.3m from @entity35 , july 2002 @entity36 - £ 28.1m from @entity37 , july 2001 @entity38 - £ 19m from @entity39 , june 2001 @entity40 - £ 12.6m from @entity41 , august 1998 @entity42 - £ 10.75m from @entity39 , july 1998 @entity43 - £ 7m from @entity44 , january 1995 @entity45 - £ 3.75m from @entity46 , july 1993 @entity47 - £ 2.3m from @entity48 , august 1989 @entity49 - £ 1.8m from @entity7 , june 1998 asked if there comes a point when @entity2 will move on to other targets , @entity1 admitted there was but said that point had n’t come yet			1
' i think a point does come [ when you give up on a transfer target ] but i think when you are interested in good players you want to give it every opportunity to materialise			0
' and i 'll do that			0
i 'll hope that things can continue to try to move forward			0
' at this moment in time i can only tell you that @entity11 is working hard to make the deals happen and we 're hoping some of them will fall into place shortly			2
' he also added that he could understand the anxiety of @entity2 fans still waiting for the first big transfer of the @entity1 era			1
so far , @entity2 have not made any new signings this summer other than @entity77 under 20 defender @entity76			2
' i can understand that [ anxiety ] , but there is n't any real update i can give you			0
but i can understand why that might be the feeling			0
' but i think everybody had thought this might be the summer - with there being quite a few changes - my new position , other managers at other clubs , and it might be that the transfers are later in the month , and i think that was always the thought i had when i came into the job			0
putting the practice in : @entity97 and his teammates warm up at @entity9 warming up : @entity99 chats with @entity100 during a training session train in the rain : manager @entity1 takes training all together : the @entity2 squad train in @entity106 international prowess : @entity108 might be interested in making the switch back to the @entity110 reunion ? @entity108 would join up with former @entity113 team - mate @entity112 ( right ) ' and you 've got to remember i only started the job on july 1 as well , so in truth i 've only been in this job for three weeks at this moment in time			1
' the @entity2 squad has been joined in @entity121 – the third leg of their tour – by @entity124 forward @entity100 and by @entity125 duo @entity97 and @entity126 , who have been injured			2
neither play will figure in @entity2 ’s game here on tuesday night but @entity1 said : ' they will figure later in the tour			1
' flying in : @entity97 ( left ) , pictured with @entity131 and the @entity110 trophy , joined up with the squad looking sharp : @entity100 ( back ) joined @entity99 ( right ) , @entity134 ( centre ) and @entity136 as the @entity2 players visited a @entity139 store in @entity10 suits you sir : @entity142 browses the shop , stopping to check out a gaudy red number sold ! @entity145 is handed a bag of goodies from an excited sales assistant how much ? @entity34 sifts through some clothes in store			0
