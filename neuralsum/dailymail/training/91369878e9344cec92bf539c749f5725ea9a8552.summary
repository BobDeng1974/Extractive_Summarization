this creepy footage shows a decaying mall overwhelmed by mold and rampant plantlife - just six months after it closed its doors			1
it shows the @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8 , which closed for good in july 2014 after being declared ' blighted ' by local authorities			1
an unidentified explorer made his way inside the complex , and finds his way through old stores , into the bowels of the building and through decaying sales displays from its heyday			2
while the last stores in the complex stayed open into last year , according to @entity51 @entity7 , by that time many had already been closed for years			0
many areas visited in the footage seemed to show their age - a movie theater , which had mold growing from the carpets , was displaying posters for movies from the summer of 2008			0
other seemingly out - of - place features were a room full of developed film photographs , and stacks of 90s - style cathode ray televisions in a back room			0
clues ? it is unclear how long all the parts of the mall were closed for - but these cinema posters show movies from 2008 old - school : among the finds inside the store was a stash of 90 - style cathode ray television sets not quite empty ? the explorer even found a mattress and pillow inside the mall - suggesting it has n't been completely vacated the footage , uploaded to @entity82 in december , passes through shops and corridors , which have received remarkably little vandalism , which usually strikes abandoned places soon after they are closed down			1
the explorer , who is not identified , warns anybody watching that they could be arrested and charged for trespass in the eerie complex			0
he also wrote that the power and alarm systems in the mall are still functional - although at least one alarmed door he pushed in the course of the video did not appear to respond			0
the unknown posters appears to be part of the urban exploration community - explorers who often dodge authorities to investigate abandoned places , and show off their footage and photographs online			1
relics : the explorer also found a stash of film photographs in a back room , suggesting some areas had been long - abandoned not much on : the mall 's cinema was hauntingly empty - and starting to get overwhelmed by mold			2

unknown explorer picked his way through @entity6 in @entity8
