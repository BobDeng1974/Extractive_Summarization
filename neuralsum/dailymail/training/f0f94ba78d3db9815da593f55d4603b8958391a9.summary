a supporter of @entity1 has admitted he tried to hide a video of the president speaking out in favour of a controversial @entity6 professor while he was a student			1
conservative rabble - rouser @entity7 had promised to release the ' explosive ' video , which shows mr @entity1 embracing outspoken academic @entity9 , just weeks before his sudden death last thursday			1
a website unearthed the video earlier today , but it initially seemed much less dramatic than one might have expected given mr @entity7 's boasts			2
scroll down for the video then - law student @entity1 speaks to a crowd at a rally supporting a controversial professor at @entity6 in 1991 embrace : mr @entity1 hugs @entity9 after urging a crowd to ' open your hearts and minds ' to the professor however , @entity23 , a @entity6 professor and ally of the president , clearly thought otherwise			1
in footage filmed last year and revealed on @entity27 tonight by the editors of mr @entity7 's website , mr @entity23 is seen showing the video of mr @entity1 and mr @entity9 to an audience of students			1
after it was completed , mr @entity23 said : ' of course , we hid this during the 2008 election ... i do n't care if they find it now			1
' hot topic : the rally was in support of mr @entity9 , who was upset that a female black professor was not tenured by the university lecture : @entity23 showed the video to a group of students and admitted he had tried to hide it no matter political persuasion , it is hard to dispute that @entity9 was a pioneer in the legal field , but controversy followed him from school to school			1
after working at the @entity57 , he used the protests of students at @entity6 to leverage himself to get a faculty position there			2
he then left to take over the dean position at the @entity63 , which made him one of the first black deans of a non-black school , if not the first			0
the diversity of the faculty at the @entity63 became a cause dear to his heart and that passion continued throughout his career			0
he left @entity72 in amid a row over faculty diversity , and then , as seen in the video featuring mr @entity1 , he spearheaded the cause when he returned the the hallowed - grounds of @entity6			1
he staged multiple sit - ins during his time there in an effort to get more female professors on staff			0
when it came to the question of @entity86 in 1991 , he even took a leave of absence from the school in protest and went on to do a hunger strike			0
mr @entity9 , pictured below , died in october of last year from carcinoid cancer			0
this afternoon , @entity93 posted a video of mr @entity1 speaking at a protest in support of mr @entity9 's fight for a more diverse faculty while he was a student at @entity6			1
the video , which runs just over a minute , was shot in 1991 when mr @entity1 was 30 years old			1
at the time , he was president of the @entity100 and a well - known figure on campus			0
at the rally in question , mr @entity1 said good things about @entity6 professor mr @entity9 , who was protesting the fact that a female black professor , @entity107 , was not given tenure			1
' i remember him sauntering up to the front and not giving us a lecture but engaging us in a conversation , ' mr @entity1 said of his memories of mr @entity9 during their law school orientation			2
professor @entity9 was a controversial but legendary figure on @entity6 's campus , as he was the first black dean at a non-black law school			1
' now how did this one man do all this , how has he accomplished all this ? he has n't done it simply by his good looks and easy charm , although he has both in ample measure , ' mr @entity1 said			1
he encouraged his fellow students to ' open up your hearts and minds to the words of professor @entity9 '			2
the pair then hugged in front of the audience , before mr @entity9 in turn addressed the crowd			0
given the size of the crowd , it was definitely a significant event on the campus , and professor @entity9 's decision to take a leave of absence - and later , go on a hunger strike - in support of ms @entity107 was certainly radical			2
though viewers were initially unsure whether or not the video was accurate , editors at mr @entity7 's website confirmed that the video is the one in question but said that it had been ' selectively edited ' by @entity93 's @entity153			0
at the @entity154 in early february , mr @entity7 said : ' i 've got videos			0
' this election we 're going to vet him , from his college days to show you why racial division and class warfare are central to what hope and change was sold in 2008 , ' he continued			2
the current editors of mr @entity7 's website confirmed that it is the video that their former leader was referencing , but added : ' the video has been selectively edited - either by the @entity171 television station or by @entity93 itself '			0
promise of controversy : @entity7 appeared at @entity154 last month and said that he had explosive videos of a young president @entity1 talking about race @entity176 has n't changed his look : president @entity1 , pictured today with @entity180 col. @entity179 , looks very similar to his law school - aged self the footage published by @entity93 did not feature the footage of mr @entity1 embracing mr @entity9 , or of mr @entity23 talking about the video			1
appearing on @entity27 to present the footage in full , one of the @entity7 editors described mr @entity9 as ' the @entity189 of academia ' , a reference to the controversial pastor of a church once attended by mr @entity1			2
the footage of mr @entity9 was not the first time that mr @entity7 tried to use videos - or the tease of videos to come - to cause problems for his @entity201 rivals			0
his videos of @entity203 and abortion clinics made him famous , and most recently he was directly involved with the resignation of former @entity207 congressman @entity206 as he obtained the politician 's sexually explicit @entity209 pictures			0
