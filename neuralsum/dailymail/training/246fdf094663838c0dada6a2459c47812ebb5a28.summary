by @entity0 published : 12:39 est , 6 january 2014 updated : 15:02 est , 6 january 2014 @entity2 , 30 , graduated in the top third of his law school class at the @entity5 , but the state @entity6 blocked him from taking the bar exam because he is a registered sex offender			1
barred : @entity2 , a @entity5 law school graduate , is battling to be allowed to take the bar exam after he was entered on the sex offenders registry for possessing child pornography in the first case of its kind in @entity15 , the court rejected @entity2 's bid and a move by the state office of @entity19 to create and endorse a blanket rule that would have kept all registered sex offenders from gaining access to the bar			1
' rather , we believe the better course would be to allow any applicant for bar admission who is on the sex offender registry the opportunity to make his or her case on an individualized basis , ' chief justice @entity24 wrote in the december 19 opinion on @entity2 's case and the proposed rule			1
@entity2 , who was convicted of a charge related to child pornography in 2007 , has until january 13 to ask the court to reconsider its decision			1
in an email , @entity2 referred @entity0 questions to his attorney , who said the reconsideration request will be filed			2
nationally , cases of felons seeking admission or re-admission to the bar are common			0
but situations of registered sex offenders attempting to do so appear to be rare			1
beyond a recent rejection in @entity56 and an ongoing case in @entity58 , legal experts and those who work to rehabilitate sex offenders could n't recall a similar situation arising in recent years			0
but @entity60 of @entity61 - a @entity63 - based organization that seeks to ease restrictions on offenders and promote rehabilitation - said she would n't be surprised to see more cases out there			0
' it is so difficult for registrants to even get jobs and support themselves and function day to day , let alone pursue a law career , ' she said			0
the @entity15 case brings up the question of how to treat someone who has admitted to criminal activity , wants to rehabilitate himself and serve others , but is still monitored by law enforcement , said @entity2 's attorney , @entity81 , of @entity82			1
' it 's a highly stigmatized thing , ' @entity81 said			0
@entity2 pleaded guilty to a charge of possession of matter portraying a sexual performance by a child in march 2007			2
he received a five - year prison sentence , which was suspended , and was required to register as a sex offender for 20 years - until 2027			1
ruling : the @entity6 has blocked @entity91 from taking the bar after disclosing the conviction and sex offender status on his applications , @entity98 at @entity99 and @entity100 at the @entity101 both rejected him in 2008			1
but the @entity102 accepted him in 2008 and he graduated in 2011			0
@entity2 later competed on the @entity103 and @entity104 , and he had a piece published in the @entity107 @entity106 through the @entity107 law school			2
questionable past : @entity2 was charged in 2007 and graduated law school in 2011 since graduating in 2011 , @entity2 has held a non-lawyer position for @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113			2
the @entity82 firm has filed letters in support of @entity2 taking the bar exam , @entity81 said			2
but @entity2 still has not been cleared by the @entity118 to take the exam that would allow him to practice law			2
@entity81 called @entity2 ' a classic sex addict			1
' ' the classic example is somebody who just downloads buckets of pornography , ' @entity81 said			0
' in that download , there just happened to be child pornography			0
' in this case , @entity2 has gone through @entity130 , despite a few admitted relapses with adult , but not child , pornography , @entity81 said			2
@entity81 also said his client used law school as a redemptive and rehabilitative effort while owning up to his criminal conduct			0
' he just has n't let it define him , ' @entity81 said			0
@entity140 , director and general counsel for the @entity118 , did not return phone and email messages seeking comment from @entity0 but in court filings , @entity140 cited the seriousness of the charge as well as @entity2 's acknowledgement of sexual addiction and ' destructive and harmful behaviors when it comes to sex and sexuality			1
' also , law school students are warned early in their legal education that behavioral issues could exclude them from being admitted to the bar , @entity140 wrote			0
@entity2 ' was aware that he might be allowed into this profession , ' @entity140 wrote			0
for the justices , the nature of the crime defines someone lacking in the ' requisite character and fitness ' to be admitted to the bar			0
' indeed , our certification could significantly mislead the public into believing that we vouch for ( @entity2 's ) good character , ' @entity24 wrote			1
' consequently , a client 's subsequent discovery of the registry listing could then justifiably lead him to question the value of this court 's certification of the good character of those who are permitted to take the bar examination			1

@entity91 , 30 , has been *banned* from taking the bar because he is a registered sex offender
he plans to appeal the decision
@entity2 's lawyer says he 's a ' sex addict ' who *accidentally* downloaded child porn
he is now a registered sex offender
the judge said that allowing @entity2 to take the bar ' could significantly mislead the public into believing that we vouch for *[* @entity2 's *]* good character '
