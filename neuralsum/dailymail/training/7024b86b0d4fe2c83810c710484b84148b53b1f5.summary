the @entity0 on friday struggled to pass a $ 1.1trillion spending bill that would avert a looming federal government shutdown , postponing a vote until monday when procedural hurdles begin to evaporate			1
negotiations between @entity6 and @entity7 to speed the process along collapsed during late - night talks in the nearly abandoned @entity10			2
barring any agreement to act in a more streamlined way , the @entity0 is on track to hold a procedural vote at 1am eastern time sunday aimed at clearing the way for passage on monday			0
some senators , angered over the bill 's easing of a ' @entity36 ' bank regulation law requirement , wanted a shot at removing the provision			2
but demands from some conservative republicans for a separate vote on an amendment to immediately defund president @entity44 's implementation of a recently announced immigration program further stymied the bill 's progress on friday			1
in order to keep federal agencies operating beyond midnight saturday , when existing funds expire , the @entity0 is expected to pass sometime saturday a stop - gap bill to temporarily fund the government through the middle of next week			1
the @entity54 already passed such a measure anticipating the @entity0 's inability to finish the broad spending bill this week			2
the 1,603 - page spending bill , negotiated by @entity7 and @entity6 appropriators and leaders , narrowly passed the @entity54 on thursday following a battle that exposed fraying unity in @entity44 's @entity6			1
a revolt over financial provisions by @entity66 @entity65 , long a staunch @entity44 ally , led to a day of tension on @entity68 on thursday			0
democrats , aware of the need for unity when republicans take full control of @entity74 next year after their midterm election gains , tried to tamp down speculation of a lasting split between @entity44 and @entity65			0
one leadership aide said @entity65 had fired a warning shot to @entity7 that @entity54 @entity6 would fight hard in the new year			1
@entity80 opened friday 's debate on the bill urging quick passage			0
' since 2011 we have lurched from crisis to crisis with the country constantly under the threat of shutdown or financial catastrophe , ' he said			0
@entity91 was also anxious to avoid another unpopular government shutdown as the @entity7 head toward taking control of the @entity0 after the november elections that also gave them a larger @entity54 majority			1
in the 219 - 206 @entity54 vote , 67 @entity7 rejected the spending bill , largely because it failed to take action to stop @entity44 's immigration order			1
but that was offset by 57 democrats who voted in favor			0
the spending bill would fund all government agencies through september 2015 , except for the @entity107 , which would get an extension only through feb. 27			0
that is the department mainly in charge of implementing the order announced by @entity44 last month .			0
