the vanishing foam being used to make sure defensive walls retreat a full ten yards at the @entity2 will come in handy over the next few days			1
no - one in this country of 200m football obsessives will ever want to see this @entity6 team ever again after they lost this @entity2 semi-final 7 - 1			1
they should be scrubbed out , wiped from the history of the game after they were picked off by @entity14 ’s rampant @entity13 team			1
@entity15 of @entity6 and @entity13 's best @entity2 goals easy : @entity18 's opening goal came when he was unmarked at a corner hammered : @entity20 speaks to his team after their 7 - 1 hammering distraught : @entity6 fans at the stadium in @entity26 stand in disbelief what a vanishing act this was , with @entity30 , @entity31 , captain @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 turning in one for the worst performances at the highest level in living memory			1
where was @entity32 when @entity39 floated over a corner for @entity18 to stab in the first ? @entity32 looked like he was in a spin drier			1
and where was @entity33 , where was @entity34 or @entity31 as @entity13 put on the full programme during this extraordinary performance ? the answer is absolutely nowhere			2
@entity33 , mild - mannered and elegant when he pulls on the shirt of @entity49 , looked like a man who had n’t played since a 4 - 0 win over @entity52 on june 3			1
in fact he gave the impression of a man who had never played the game at all when @entity57 , @entity39 and @entity58 added to the scoreline			1
emotional : @entity32 unable to hold back the tears following full time no hiding place : @entity34 reacting after full time @entity62 in @entity26 after devastating @entity13 win in many ways , what with the shrine to @entity68 10 baseball caps in his honour , a shirt held up by @entity32 with his name on - they really asked for this			2
they were lost in the moment , failing to pay attention to the job in hand and that was to reach the final against @entity82 or @entity83			0
‘ @entity84 ’ @entity20 had called it			0
well they got to the sixth and only hell will await them after this semi-final shambles			0
the target was to win the @entity2 and a embroider a sixth gold star on that beautiful yellow jersey			2
there are some dark days ahead indeed for @entity6 now			2
big @entity20 - @entity20 - will pay the price			0
he will be sacked by the @entity96 for this shameful semi-final exit			0
@entity20 , a @entity2 winner himself with the 2002 vintage , can not escape the blame for this disastrous performance			2
on the eve of the game he had lightened the mood by revealing that @entity32 , one of the team jokers , often mimics the coach during team meetings			0
embrace : @entity57 , who grabbed the second for @entity13 , consoling @entity109 brace : @entity39 scored the third and fourth on the night high five : @entity58 puts @entity13 5 - 0 up before half an hour abject : @entity6 's defending was non-existent all night first to every ball : @entity6 's team were off the pace all night it is fair to say that no - one wants to be in @entity20 ’s shoes now			1
he should be wondering what on god ’s earth he was doing when he presented @entity14 with a @entity96 ‘ goodie bag ’ before the national anthems were played			0
@entity14 looked at him with utter bemusement			0
it was toe - curling to watch them concede five times inside 29 mental minutes at the @entity129 and yet this could have all been avoided			2
had that back four , players who have @entity132 pedigree with @entity133 , @entity49 , @entity134 and @entity135 , remained at their stations and stayed in position the score would have been 0 - 0 at half - time			1
instead they hared around the stadium , losing their minds and this game even before @entity18 struck @entity13 ’s opening goal in the 11th minute			1
finisher : @entity145 , who scored @entity13 's final two , consoles his @entity134 team - mate @entity147 contrast : @entity20 with triumphant @entity13 coach @entity14 those boys have enough experience to know that the race is n’t won in the opening laps and yet they lost their discipline , shape and , with it , the game			1
it was embarrassing and pitiful			0
@entity32 ’s performance brought back @entity159 ’s ‘ @entity163 footballer ’ analogy , the comment that made the former @entity134 defender mad			0
@entity164 got it right because the stand - in captain was all over the shop			0
there is the mild temptation to argue that playing on the right side of @entity6 ’ s defence , instead of his preferred left , because of @entity175 ’s suspension was somehow to blame			0
this was a performance of shock and awe by @entity13 , a ruthless exhibition of flair and fantasy as they chase their first @entity2 win since 1990			1
they will take some stopping now , that much is clear			0
to be 5 - 0 up inside 29 minutes of a @entity2 semi-final in the host ’s backyard is really something quite radical			1
after this , @entity6 just lost a lot of respect .			0

@entity6 beaten 7 - 1 by @entity13 in @entity2 semi-final
5 - 0 down in the game after just 29 minutes
@entity18 , @entity57 , @entity39 ( 2 ) , @entity58 and @entity199 ( 2 ) on target for the @entity201
@entity147 grabs a late *consolaton* for @entity6 in the 90th minute
