' i sit here in a coffee shop in @entity50 , @entity8 , planning another foray into the @entity17 , ' mr @entity13 wrote on july 10 , ' where the sense that one 's life is in the hands of the mountains can be as blinding as the endless white glaciers , and a thirst for glory can darken our better judgment more than the blackness of night			1
' rescuers found the men 's bright yellow tent at 16,700 feet next to evidence of an avalanche on thursday			1
chilling : just one day before setting off on the climb , mr @entity13 , pictured left with mr @entity14 , wrote a blog suggesting the @entity8 climb may be his last an eight - man team from @entity8 's high - mountain rescue police unit was also involved in the search and the @entity5 embassy and the men 's families attempted to get a helicopter to join the rescue effort			1

' he spent a lot of time here , did a lot of hard routes ' said mr @entity18			0
mr @entity89 said @entity15 is ' one of the most dangerous ( peaks ) to climb and it 's not typical for people to climb it because the weather is difficult year - round , a combination of strong winds , avalanches and enormous crevasses			2
' even though it is in the tropics , nights are freezing in the @entity17 , a range popular with climbers but also among the world 's most dangerous due to the instability of snow and ice caused by wide temperatures fluctuations			1

the @entity17 climbing season runs from june to september and so far this year six mountaineers have lost their lives in the range and at least 40 have been evacuated due to medical problems , mostly altitude sickness and hypothermia , said mr @entity89			2
many of the roughly 8,000 foreigners who mr @entity89 said climb the @entity17 annually do so without hiring local guides , whose absence can make ascents more perilous as snow and ice conditions can quickly change .			0
