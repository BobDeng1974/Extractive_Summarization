it is 10.15 on a sunday morning at the shipwrights council playing fields in @entity3 , kick - off is a quarter of an hour away and there is no sign of the home team			1
@entity8 , a second division pub side , are locked out of the car park and are getting changed on the roadside			1
the odd player still wears the ink of a nightclub entry stamp			2
a woman of about 50 – militant in her approach – marches from @entity16 , a sheltered housing scheme nearby			2
‘ bloody hell , how you doing son ? ’			2
@entity18 ( pronounced @entity50 - o aaa - ca in these parts ) – the city ’s adopted son and former @entity3 favourite of 177 appearances – happily engages in conversation			1
the abandoned cars – peugeots not @entity59 – are not mentioned again			2
in the distance , four aluminous , checked corner - flags emerge from the bushes followed by a group of lads from @entity66 dragging two nets			1
@entity18 – still only 33 and forced to retire earlier this year because of a toe injury – pays his £ 3.50 subs and races through a warm - up routine , which , for some of his team - mates , does not extend beyond a blast at their goalkeeper , who normally plays in midfield			1
there are a few nudges and glances from the opposition , they ’re about to share a pitch with their @entity3 idol , a ball - playing midfielder who was signed by @entity86 from @entity32 for £ 3.5million as a 19 - year - old in 2000			1
he had captained @entity25 ’s @entity89 winning under - 20 side , which included @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94			1
@entity18 admits that his team - mates do n't make the same kind of runs he is used to the former youth international poses with his team - mates ahead of a crucial game ... against @entity66 today , though , the players are overweight , the pitch is overgrown and play is overcrowded			1
except when @entity18 has the ball			1
his first touch is second nature , his final pass never wayward			2
he is shown due respect			2
one lad , however , having been outwitted by @entity18 , tugs on his jersey as he breaks away			1
he immediately regrets it and apologises			2
there is a handshake and the perpetrator is all smiles			2
he ’s not going to wash that hand			2
those on the sideline seize upon his weakness			2
‘ aww , friends , football friends , ’ they mock , using the line from @entity122			2
the comedy apart , it ’s a cracking contest and @entity18 is its best player , save for one audacious 45 - yard lob which buries itself in the bushes and calls for a new ball			1
@entity131 win 1 - 0 , they are honest , hard - working and enjoy it from first minute to last			2
@entity18 was the star of the show as his side won the game 1 - 0 back down to business , @entity18 admits he enjoys heading to the pub after the matches @entity18 was bought for a total of over £ 5m by @entity3 and @entity22 , now he pays £ 3.50 in subs and so it is back to the boozer to celebrate , the former @entity145 footballer pulling up his barstool among the boys , including workers from car plant @entity149 , plumbers , security guards and students			1
there are two questions for @entity18 , whose @entity25 wife @entity156 is at home a few miles away in @entity159 with their boys @entity161 , two , and three - month - old @entity162			1
how and why ? ‘ i know one of the lads , @entity165			2
when i was still playing he always said to me , “ you ’ll have to play for us one day ” , ’ he laughs , suggesting the idea was never entertained			1
‘ then we came here for a drink about five weeks ago and he asked me again			1
i was n’t playing so thought “ okay , why not ? ”			0
he got me to sign the forms that day ! ‘ it was only when i started playing again with these lads that i realised how much i was missing it			0
‘ you have to adapt and i ca n’t expect them to run all over			0
the first few weeks i was looking for a pass and it was n’t there			0
i now know what they can and ca n’t do			0
but i ’ve scored a couple of goals , a free - kick on my debut , and it ’s great when you win			0
’ still in shape , @entity18 gets ready for the game against @entity66 the 33 - year - old says he does n't need the swanky footballer bars to have fun he continues : ‘ my missus wants me in the house with our boys but she is okay about this - she knows how much i love it			1
last night my little one did not sleep at all and i was up every two hours , but that ’s fine , this is n’t the @entity145 anymore			0
‘ but they are great lads and i ’m just one of them			0
i ’ve been out with them for a few drinks and it ’s great fun – no shiny bars like when you ’re a footballer , just good old pubs like this			0
’ @entity18 moved to @entity22 from @entity3 in 2006 and , after 181 appearances , that is where his career was brought to a premature end			1
‘ i picked up the injury in 2006 , ’ he reveals			0
‘ i played with @entity222 injections to take the pain away			0
as the years went on i was having too many injections and i went for an operation			0
they tried to correct the position of my toe but it did n’t work out , it was too painful to play			1
‘ my contract finished in 2013 and i tried rehab for nearly a year but it just did n’t work out			1
it ’s hard to accept at times			0
my body is still fine and , apart from the foot injury , i could still be playing			0
’ @entity18 and his family plan to return to @entity238 – 11 miles south of @entity239 - next year , where media work or coaching is the plan			1
but the @entity244 will always be his second home			1
he plans to head back to @entity25 with his family for media work or possibly coaching ‘ i have been here nearly 15 years away from my family , ’ he says			1
‘ it ’s been great and i would do it all again , no regrets			0
‘ everyone has always been friendly with me			0
i always get people talking to me , but i love that			0
i ’m just a normal lad who was lucky enough to get paid to play football			1
‘ now i pay to play , although you do get a free pint if you ’re man - of - the - match ! ’ it was @entity18 who was involved in the challenge which ended @entity261 ’s career in 2006			1
it was innocuous and the @entity264 legend was due to retire the following month in any case			0
still , though , the lads from @entity131 would not let him play in a recent match against a team from @entity269 for fear of reprisal			1
‘ i get a little bit of a bite from @entity264 fans , ’ he smiles , ‘ but they ’re generally okay with me			0
yes , @entity261 had his last 50 - 50 with me , but he never blamed me for that , it was n’t even a tackle really			0
but the lads here quite like mentioning it			0
’ @entity8 will be grateful to have his services for a while longer @entity18 poses with @entity20 reporter @entity281 in the @entity131 pub after the game those same lads are captivated by his tales			1
‘ i came here as a teenager from a small club in @entity25 and was playing in front of 48,000			1
it was incredible , ’ he recalls , enjoying a pint among his new comrades			1
‘ i could not speak much @entity292 but i got involved with the banter			0
after a few months i went to training with @entity296 ’s book			0
i showed @entity86 the pictures of that goal ( dribble against @entity299 , including @entity86 , at @entity300 86 ) and he was n’t happy ! but he was a great guy and i thank him for bringing me here			0
‘ i was looking to make that big step to @entity303			0
i took the chance , sometimes you do n’t get another one			0
my mum was upset but my dad understood how important it was			0
i spent some long nights on my own but i knew what i wanted to do			0
‘ what he has always wanted to do is play football			2
@entity313 here in the @entity131 , that much is obvious .			0

@entity18 was asked by a friend to play for pub side @entity8
