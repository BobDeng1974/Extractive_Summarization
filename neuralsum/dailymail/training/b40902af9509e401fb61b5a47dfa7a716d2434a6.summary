an aquarium has been urged to stop throwing after - hours parties by an animal welfare group who believe they could cause distress to the marine life with fish even ' attacking each other out of frustration '			1
@entity9 ( @entity9 ) have written to aquarium executives at the @entity11 in the city 's @entity12 , claiming that ' aquariums that market themselves as party venues create even more of a nightmare for the animals at these facilities '			1
however , the aquarium 's curator , @entity20 , insisted that animal welfare was paramount at all exhibitions and the staff prided themselves on providing the highest possible standard of care for the aquatic life			0
' our curatorial staff are onsite to monitor the animals at all times during any function or event ; this includes the use of decibel meters to monitor sound as well as restrictions on the use of additional lighting , decorations and equipment			0
' @entity11 has thrown a string of limited - edition 18 + events run by non-profit arts company @entity61 , called hijinks , in recent months where djs and artists entertain guests to help raise awareness around crucial marine conservation issues pop - up bars are also set up inside the aquarium and the @entity71 's website promises party goers can ' grab a drink at the pop up bars serving @entity77 beers or @entity79 cocktails , take selfies with @entity82 sharks , chat with conservationists or simply get a head start on the weekend '			1
the event also says attendees can ' reclaim the aquarium as their own over the course of a wild and eventful evening '			0
in the strongly - worded letter to @entity90 and @entity11 executives , @entity9 said : ' events such as this , which take place outside normal opening hours , while animals would normally be resting , are likely to have a detrimental impact on aquarium residents , particularly if the visitors behave in a manner that causes the animals stress			1
' aquarium curator , @entity20 , insisted that animal welfare was paramount at all exhibitions mr @entity20 said staff prided themselves on providing the highest possible standard of care for the aquatic life @entity9 reasoned : ' as you can imagine , loud parties and captive animals are a bad mix. ' employees at aquariums have themselves said that the animals become extremely agitated during these events , even attacking one another out of frustration			1
' experts have stated that anthropogenic noise at high levels can affect animal behaviour , mask important natural sounds on which they depend , alter their physiological function and physically injure them			0
' in their plea @entity9 said marine animals in small tanks already experience ' enough stress '			1
' events with loud sounds held at aquariums are debilitating to these animals , who have no other choice in dealing with their frustration and discomfort but to swim around in endless circles			2
' aquariums should be responsible for the safety of the animals in their care			0
allowing these late - night events to continue does not demonstrate adequate consideration for animal welfare , ' they added			2
during the events so far the aquarium 's dugongs , which have acute hearing and sensitivity to sound , have not been present as their part of the centre was being renovated			2
on @entity71 's @entity155 page this week they announced : ' if you missed @entity158 & @entity159 , as their home was undergoing massive renovations			0
good news : the dugongs are back for @entity163 on october 30th			0
lettuce for everyone ! ' but @entity9 says that parties could have a ' detrimental impact on the aquarium residents ' @entity9 believes that loud sounds left the marine life with ' no other choice in dealing with their frustration and discomfort but to swim around in endless circles '			2

@entity9 have urged @entity11 to stop their after - hours parties
the events offer djs , *vodka* cocktails , selfies with @entity82 sharks and ' a head start on the weekend '
events are run by a non-profit arts company and the aquarium says they carried out checks to ensure no marine animals would be harmed
' animals become extremely agitated during these events , even attacking one another out of frustration , ' @entity9 have claimed
