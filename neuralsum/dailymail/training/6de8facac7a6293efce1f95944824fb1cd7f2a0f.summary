@entity6 ' mother @entity5 called for an ambulance when the infant suffered a fit at home and stopped breathing			1
but instead of reaching the infant within the recommended eight minutes it took paramedics - who were the third ambulance to be called - 26 minutes to arrive at the scene			1
the health trust responsible for the crew has now identified a ' catalogue of errors ' in a damning report into the tragedy			2
three - month - old @entity6 , pictured with her mother @entity5 , died after an ambulance took three times the target time to reach her because it stopped to refuel then got lost twice @entity28 's ( @entity29 ) own investigation into the blunders has found : by the time @entity6 was seen by a doctor she had not been breathing for almost an hour and was pronounced dead			1
in addition , @entity6 's family claim the paramedics insensitively joked about creaking knees when they first bent down to scoop up the baby			1
and during the journey back to the hospital the crew casually talked about their weekend , the family claim			2
by the time @entity6 was seen by a doctor she had not been breathing for almost an hour and was pronounced dead @entity29 , which is already under fire for other similar tragedies , has said it is now recruiting more frontline staff to improve its service			1
but @entity6 's family have called for more to be done ahead of an inquest , which will rule on the blunders ' contribution to the infant 's death			1
@entity6 's devastated mother @entity52 and father , lorry driver @entity54 , both 24 , have slammed the ambulance trust as a ' shambles '			1
in a statement released through their solicitor , the couple said : ' we see this report as an important first step towards establishing the facts and ensuring a dramatic improvement in the ambulance service			0
' it was a catalogue of errors			0
the report portrays an organization in a complete shambles			0
' @entity6 was one of five patients to die following ambulance delays during march alone			2
' for years it was known there was an alarming problem , but warnings went unheeded			0
' there is however no evidence that staff on the ground were responsible for the problems , and we can only wonder what their morale must be like			0
' the damning report was compiled following @entity6 's death on march 11 , after her family made an official complaint			1
the health trust responsible for the crew has now identified a ' catalogue of errors ' in a damning report into the tragedy @entity6 stopped breathing at around 11am at her home in @entity97 , @entity98 , after suffering a fit and her mother dialled 999			1
it was the third time the mother had called an ambulance amid concerns for her daughter			2
on the first occasion the crew arrived in just two minutes and @entity5 and paramedics managed to revive her			0
the second incident was more serious and after the ambulance promptly arrived @entity6 was taken to hospital			2
on the third , fatal occasion , the report alleges the series of ' failures ' took place during the critical 26 minutes it took an ambulance to reach the patient			2
the report details how the first ambulance sent to the call was already treating a patient in a @entity125 hospital , 30 miles away			1
the ambulance went round a roundabout on the outskirts of @entity129 twice before taking the longer route to @entity131			0
the new report also revealed that an air ambulance was dispatched with a clinician on board , but the other ambulance was n't notified and had by this time collected the patient			1
it also explains when the baby finally reached @entity131 she was carried inside by a medic , rather than been wheeled on a stretcher , which would have allowed treatment to take place			1
speaking when the @entity29 confirmed it was investigating @entity6 's death @entity5 , also mother to son @entity146 , four , said : ' the people who are meant to help failed @entity6			1
if they had got to her in time she would be alive today			0
' the family 's lawyer @entity148 , a medical negligence specialist with @entity151 , says the family will consider their legal position after the inquest , in september			0
a spokesman for the @entity29 said : ' we can confirm that a thorough internal investigation has taken place and the findings have been shared as appropriate ahead of the coroner 's inquest which is being held in @entity98 in september			0
' as a @entity28 , we are in the process of recruiting more frontline staff and getting more ambulances on the road in order to improve our performance for patients living in those areas of most need			0
' this approach is borne out of our turnaround plan published in april and , in effect , by increasing staffing and resources , we can help reduce journey times of crews and ensure that we are responding to patients more quickly			0
' @entity6 's death is one of five the @entity29 , which covers @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity98 and @entity187 , is currently facing questions over			2
it has been criticised for almost two years over its poor response times , particularly in rural areas , before it was reviewed			0

baby died after ambulance took three times the target time to reach her
three - month - old @entity6 suffered a fit and stopped breathing
@entity202 has found a ' catalogue of errors '
ambulance that was **initially** called was 30 miles away and treating a patient
another crew was free and five miles but never sent to **emergency**
ambulance that was dispatched became lost twice and stopped to refuel
by time infant was seen by doctor she had not been breathing for an hour
a crew attending a patient 30 miles away was **initially** *assigned* , when there was an ambulance free just five miles away - but was never dispatched ;
when a third ambulance was finally sent to the **emergency** it had to stop to refuel ;
the crew of the third ambulance , *including* a driver on her first shift , then could n't find the house that other ambulances had not struggled to reach ;
an air ambulance carrying a doctor was dispatched to the scene , but no - one *informed* the ground paramedics , who drove off with @entity6 ;
the ambulance then got lost again on its way back to @entity131 , even though @entity6 's mother was shouting directions ;
when it finally reached the hospital the paramedics did not know how to work the lift and a paramedic carried the infant inside the hospital .
