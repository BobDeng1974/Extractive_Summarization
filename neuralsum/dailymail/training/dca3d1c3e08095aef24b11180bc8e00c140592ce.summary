a married woman whose husband donated sperm without her knowledge is calling for clinics to be forced to ask for a wife 's consent			1
the unnamed mother - of - one from @entity8 said she feared that children fathered with the sperm – who would be half - brothers or sisters of her son – may one day ' disrupt ' the family by getting in touch			1
she has written to the @entity17 calling for guidelines on sperm donation to include the spouse 's views – and says the sperm should be treated as a joint ' marital asset '			1
the unnamed woman has made contact with @entity26 ( pictured ) who conceived two children using her late husband 's frozen sperm after a legal battle in marriage , sperm should be considered some kind of ' marital asset ' , wife argues a controversial ruling in 2005 meant all children born through sperm donation – up to ten families are allowed per donor – have the right to trace their biological father when they reach adulthood			1
in her heartfelt letter to the fertility watchdog , she told how her husband had donated sperm against her wishes after suffering @entity50 following the birth of their child			1
but if the children he fathers – to help infertile couples or single women – contacted her in the future , she would ' not feel able to push them away '			2
the businesswoman said : ' i am personally in this situation with my husband having donated sperm against my wishes when he was suffering from ptsd			2
' despite my contacting the clinic ( i never received an acknowledgment ) , this sperm may already have been used to father children who in 18 years ' time may come knocking on our door , disrupting family life and unsettling our own children			1
' sperm donation helps infertile couples to have families and is also used for research purposes she added : ' there is then a huge emotional debt i would owe the child			2
i would not feel that i could push them away			0
it is something i would need to explain to our son			0
' it is not something i had ever imagined having to encounter			0
it would almost feel like introducing the offspring of an adulterous relationship			0
' the wife believes that the procedure for sperm donation ' should also include the wife or partner being asked about their views and signalling consent			1
' she said : ' i think it is a decision both parties should make			0
it [ the sperm ] must be some sort of marital asset			1
' the woman has made contact with @entity26 , the widow who won a legal battle to conceive her two children using her late husband 's frozen sperm after his sudden death from meningitis			1
mrs @entity26 said : ' there needs to be a public discussion about the matter			0
when fighting my own case i quoted the marriage vows which say “ @entity118 is yours ”			2
sperm donors are recruited through licensed clinics and are not paid but can claim reasonable expenses for travel and lost earnings			2
a man who has donated sperm may withdraw his consent before it has been used			2
there is no obligation for clinics to establish whether the wife objects , although some counsellors suggest men discuss the subject with their partner			0
since the 2005 ruling against donor anonymity , they must provide a name and address			0
dr @entity139 , a former @entity140 board member and specialist in men 's health at @entity143 in @entity144 said he was ' grateful the point had been raised '			0
he said : ' at the moment , the person from whose body the sperm comes has total say over its use , but if this use impacts on the wife 's family life , the situation is not cut and dried			1
' an @entity140 spokesman said : ' donors must , by law , be offered counselling to discuss their donation before it takes place			0
this helps to ensure consent is fully formed free and properly thought through			0

wife concerned about the *psychological* affect *potential* children fathered by her husband will have on the family
his donation may produce as many as 20 children
she claims , in marriage , the husband 's sperm should be considered ' marital asset '
in a letter to the @entity17 , she calls for wives ' consent to be *mandatory*
