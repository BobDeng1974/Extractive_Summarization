support for mr @entity0 ’s party is running at 32 per cent in @entity5 – four points ahead of the conservatives on 28 per cent , and five points ahead of the @entity15 , who hold the seat			0
it is the first time a constituency poll has put @entity4 in the lead			0
@entity4 founder dr @entity21 attacked current party leader @entity0 branding him a ' dim , racist alcoholic ' the boost for the party came as its founder , dr @entity21 , gave an astonishing interview in which he described mr @entity0 as ‘ alcoholic , dim and racist ’ and repeated claims he first made in this newspaper a decade ago – which mr @entity0 strongly denies – that the @entity4 leader had referred to black people as ‘ n * * * * * s ’			1
the @entity33 poll was carried out a year after @entity4 rocked @entity34 by coming within four percentage points of winning @entity5			0
despite his criticism , dr @entity21 believes @entity0 ( pictured ) will win a seat at the next general election the poll puts @entity4 top even though mr @entity0 was not suggested as the likely candidate , indicating that the party ’s appeal is not necessarily dependent on his ‘ personality cult ’			1
earlier this month a @entity47 poll in @entity48 , where the @entity4 leader has hinted he might stand at next year ’s general election , put mr @entity0 three points behind the incumbent conservative mp			2
but the new poll – funded by @entity53 , a @entity4 donor – indicates his best chance of winning a @entity57 seat might lie in three - way marginals such as @entity5			0
dr @entity21 made the scathing remarks about mr @entity0 during an interview published today			2
the @entity62 professor also repeated a claim he made in 2004 that mr @entity0 had once said : ‘ we will never win the n * * * * r vote			0
’ in his interview with the @entity68 think - tank , dr @entity21 also claims that mr @entity0 admires @entity70 president @entity69 because ‘ @entity69 is clearly a nasty piece of work and @entity0 probably identifies with that ’			2
a @entity4 spokesman said : ‘ dr @entity21 is free to hold whatever view he likes of our party and our leader , but his repeated claim that @entity0 used the “ @entity80 ” is untrue and has been vigorously denied before			1
