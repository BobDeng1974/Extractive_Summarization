by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 has branded threats @entity4 could be thrown out of the @entity5 if relegated from the @entity6 this season as ' unrealistic '			1
the @entity9 boss criticised the financial fair play rules that could land the @entity12 club with a £ 40million fine			1
@entity15 chief executive @entity14 has warned @entity4 must pay their impending fine for expected losses of £ 60million from last term , when they won promotion from the @entity5 , or be punished in another way , which could include being refused entry to the @entity6			1
' there would have to be quite a few kicked out if that were to happen , would n't there ? ' said @entity2 , ahead of @entity4 's league trip to @entity39 on sunday			1
' i think it 's unrealistic , and i do n't see it happening			2
' to make it fair play we should be able to spend as much as @entity46 before we play them on sunday should n't we ? ' what is fair play ? i do n't know			1
' one team can spend £ 200million on a team , another team might spend £ 8million on a team , and that 's not fair play is it			1
' fair play would be everybody having a maximum of £ 30million a year to spend on their team , produce some kids out of the youth team and work harder with the players they 've got			1
' to call it fair play , the whole league is n't fair play : you 've got seven teams at the top on another planet			1
' i do n't know what the rules are to be honest , but the owners have brought a few players in			0
' we 've lost ( @entity73 ) @entity72 but we 've spent maybe £ 20million above the @entity72 money , so the owners have been fantastic , the effort to help us compete			0
' but it 's never going to be a fair playing field , you have n't got to be a genius to know the top seven will almost certainly be the same as last year			0
' it can get a bit boring , but it will be the same , i 'm pretty sure of that			0
' @entity72 moved to @entity85 from rivals @entity4 in a deal on the day before the transfer deadline @entity15 chief executive @entity14 has warned @entity4 that they will have to pay the fine @entity89 is adamant the @entity15 has the power to impose sanctions on @entity4 , despite their summer promotion			1
' theoretically that is the position , but i would hope there would be resolution long before that option even had to be considered , " @entity14 said at @entity95 's @entity94 conference on tuesday			2
' we are satisfied we still have the ability under our regulations to charge them for a breach of our rules whilst they were in membership			0
' the one thing for certain is that most clubs [ in the @entity6 ] will become a @entity15 club again			2
" @entity2 believes @entity4 can avoid the situation entirely if they secure their @entity6 status this term			2
' i 've blocked it out of my own mind , ' he said			0
' that 's up to the owners , i 'm sure they know what they 're doing and i 'll leave it to them			0
' if we can ( avoid relegation ) yes , but it 's a difficult one : if teams invest then get relegated , what do you do ? ' you lose all your players			0
' if you buy a few players to try to stay up then go down , you ca n't suddenly have a fire sale , it 's tough to unload players on @entity6 wages into the championship			0
' it 's a chicken and egg situation : do you just come up and go down again , and not spend any money ? ' or do you spend the money , go down again and struggle to release the players , and get punished by the @entity23 rule ? ' i do n't know , it 's a strange one			0
