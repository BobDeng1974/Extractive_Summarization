mrs @entity10 , who was a backing singer for @entity40 in the @entity41 , has not spoken publicly since news of the couple ’s separation was revealed two weeks ago			1

‘ he is only interested in going out with his friends and partying			0
he is obsessed with the limelight and would go to the opening of an envelope			0
he finds her boring and thinks she is a nag when she asks him to spend time with his family , ’ a friend told the newspaper			2
the report revealed that the singer , whose band industry twice topped the charts in @entity24 , was under the impression that her husband was keen to make their marriage work and had agreed to attend couple counseling sessions			1
instead , she learned that he wanted a divorce in a text message he ’d sent to her in error , only minutes after reassuring her that their relationship could be saved			1
former @entity9 and @entity8 captain @entity0 has split from his wife @entity75 , pictured with their children a source loyal to mrs @entity10 told the @entity15 , ‘ she does everything for her children not to see her cry , but she just ca n't believe how he has treated her			1
he has watched her go through this alone			0
‘ the man has completely isolated her			0
her whole life was his life , his friends were her friends , and she has just been left on her own with the kids			0
she has become reclusive in their home - only going to the gym and to take the kids out			0
’ @entity0 reportedly became cold towards his wife some weeks ago after she ’d flown home to @entity24 to visit her family			1
after arriving back in @entity93 , she was given the number of a lawyer to consult by an intermediary acting for @entity0			1
when she confronted her husband , he denied he wanted a divorce or had sought legal advice , her friends told the paper			1
last year , @entity0 bowed out of top - flight cricket , saying he wanted to ‘ see my children grow ’ , prompted by a terrible accident in which his daughter suffered burns from boiling water minutes after this reassurance , mrs @entity10 received a text from her husband – apparently intended for his lawyer – demanding to know ‘ why @entity75 had been informed , because he [ @entity0 ] wanted to tell her himself			1
’ the haste with which @entity0 has insisted on a divorce has led his distraught wife to wonder whether he has met someone else			1
‘ she has been thinking about this , because the divorce came so quickly			2
she does n't know for sure if there is another woman , but if there is , she will have a lot to say to her , ’ the friend said			0
the couple met when the @entity24 pop singer was on holiday in @entity9 exactly four years ago			1

within a year they were parents - daughter @entity129 was born in 2012 followed a year later by son @entity132			0
but the strain of being alone in a strange city with two small children , while her husband toured with the @entity9 team or made public appearances , began to take its toll on the young mother			2

he has had a million jobs			0
she is a stay - at - home mother			0
from monday to friday she does n't even leave the house			0
she does n't go anywhere , she does n't have a fancy lifestyle , she does n't go to social events , ’ the friend told the @entity15			2
last year , @entity0 bowed out of top - flight cricket , saying he wanted to ‘ see my children grow ’ , prompted by a terrible accident in which his daughter suffered burns from boiling water			1
however , friends of his wife claimed ‘ family life bored him ’ and his retirement led to even more conflict between them with @entity0 seeking out the company of friends and spending time drinking			1
and when mrs @entity10 attempted to relaunch her own music career by entering @entity9 idols last year , her husband did not even bother to watch her on television			2
‘ he has not made himself available to @entity75			2
he slotted them in when he could , but he was busy with his own things from the moment he woke up to the moment he went to bed			0
he could never come down from the hype			0
if he was n't on tv doing the commentating , he had to be with the boys where they were all bigging him up , drinking and making him feel good			0
in 2011 , mrs @entity10 was a backing singer for @entity24 pop due @entity40 , who represented @entity24 in the @entity185 , pictured ‘ he told @entity75 he wanted a family life , but he just could n't do it			1
he spent so long being the king that family life bored him			0

’ ‘ he did n't even watch her on the show [ @entity194 ] , it was nothing to him			0
he did n't care , he was too busy doing his own thing			0
" @entity0 ’s agent , @entity197 , last night issued a joint statement from the couple emphasising that ‘ our marriage has broken down purely due to irreconcilable differences			1
' we understand that there will be speculation as regards the breakdown of our marriage ... [ and ] would once again request that our privacy is respected during this difficult time			2
