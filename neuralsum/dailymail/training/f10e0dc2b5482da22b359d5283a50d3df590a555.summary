if @entity0 continue to perform like this , promotion to the @entity3 seems inevitable			1
@entity5 ’s side cemented their place at the top of the @entity8 by taking control from the off and playing some quicksilver stuff			0
two sumptuous goals from @entity13 and @entity14 early on were the decisive moments , but their football could have produced more			1
it got a little frayed in the second half , with @entity5 demanding more from his team as a few passes went astray , but goalkeeper @entity21 was not troubled			1
@entity13 starred for @entity0 and scored the opener before providing the assist for @entity14 's goal the on - loan @entity14 ( centre ) slots home the second goal for @entity0 to give them a 2 - 0 lead over @entity29 @entity30 ( left ) was a constant threat for the @entity32 and came close to getting on the scoresheet @entity0 starting @entity34 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity35 ; @entity36 6.5 , @entity37 6.5 , @entity38 6.5 , @entity39 6.5 ; @entity40 7 ( @entity41 76 ’ 5.5 ) , @entity42 7 ( @entity43 71 ’ 5 ) , @entity13 7.5 ; @entity30 7 , @entity44 6.5 , @entity14 7 ( @entity45 69 ’ 5.5 ) subs not used : @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 boss : @entity5 7 goals : @entity13 9 , @entity14 17 @entity29 starting @entity34 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity53 6 ; @entity54 5 ( @entity55 46 ’ 5.5 ) , @entity56 6 , @entity57 6 , @entity58 6 ; @entity59 6 , @entity60 6 , @entity61 6 , @entity62 5.5 ( @entity63 68 ’ 5.5 ) ; @entity64 6 ; @entity65 6 ( @entity66 71 ’ 5 ) subs not used : @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity71 - @entity70 , @entity72 manager : @entity74 6 referee : @entity76 7 @entity77 : @entity13 the impression has been that @entity0 were stuttering slightly , needing a late penalty to beat @entity80 last saturday having drawn their previous two championship games from behind and losing to @entity82 in the @entity83			1
but this victory over @entity29 , in front of their owners flown over from @entity88 , made it eight wins from their last 11 league matches			2
‘ the first - half was fantastic , but it is very difficult to keep that tempo , ’ said @entity5			0
‘ there was a maturity about the performance			0
a good night ’s work , we move on			2
‘ i hope we can keep it up			0
as i ’ve always said , with ten games to go that ’s when the season starts			0
’ his opposite number @entity107 , was unequivocal			0
‘ they are the best team in the league			0
they deserve to be in the @entity3 , ’ he said			0
‘ i am sure if they continue to play like this , to move the ball well , to press the opponent , they have the quality			2
’ @entity0 were at @entity29 early and took the lead in the ninth minute			1
will @entity40 threaded a pass to @entity44 , who turned provider by teeing up @entity119 for the simplest of finishes from two yards			1
@entity44 has scored seven goals during this loan move from @entity124 but his cross showed he can assist too			1
five minutes later @entity30 sent a crisp shot just wide of the post , drawing mistaken cheers from some in the stands			2
will @entity40 ( right ) dominated the midfield throughout and keeps a close eye on @entity29 's @entity133 in the 17th minute it did become 2 - 0			1
@entity13 slipped a delightful pass to @entity14 , who galloped onto the ball and struck an accurate first - time finish into the far corner			1
it was the winger ’s first goal on his first league start since joining on loan from @entity143			2
@entity40 sent another shot narrowly wide at the end of a flowing move before @entity13 hit the crossbar from range on the stroke of half - time			1
@entity0 ’s ability in the transfer market under chief executive @entity153 was evident , the front trio of @entity44 , @entity30 and @entity14 all secured on loan during a busy winter window			1
@entity42 performed well in his second start in four days following seven months out with a serious knee injury , before @entity5 withdrew him in the 71st minute			0
@entity29 boss @entity107 made three changes to try to affect matters , with @entity133 again sent on			0
he could not repeat his scoring trick from the 3 - 0 win over @entity163 though			0
@entity165 - @entity164 had a free - kick in a threatening position but whipped it over the bar			0
that was as close as the visitors came			0
having gotten over a small wobble in that second period , @entity0 saw the game out comfortably as their supporters were able to sing about ‘ being top of the table ’			1
the challenge is to make good on this promise and stay there			2
@entity37 ( left ) is challenged by @entity64 during his side 's 2 - 0 victory over @entity29 @entity107 ( left ) and @entity5 look on as their sides clashed at the @entity184			2

@entity13 gave @entity0 the lead after nine minutes following good build up play from @entity40 and @entity44 led to the opening goal
@entity13 turned to provider as he slipped @entity14 in to slot home
@entity0 eased to victory and were *rarely* troubled by the @entity194
