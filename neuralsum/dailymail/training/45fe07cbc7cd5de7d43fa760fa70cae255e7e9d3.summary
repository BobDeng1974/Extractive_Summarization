@entity0 insisted he was relishing the challenge after his domination of the @entity3 came under serious threat in @entity5			1
two ahead after the opening round and three in front at halfway following a second successive 67 , @entity0 was four shots clear of a star - studded field late in the third round at @entity11 on saturday			1
however , the former @entity13 champion then bogeyed the 17th in a round of 71 to finish 11 under par , one ahead of @entity19 's @entity18 and two ahead of @entity21 team - mate @entity20 and @entity22 champion @entity22			1
@entity0 is one - shot clear after round three @entity3 at @entity11 the @entity24 's three - shot lead narrowed on day three but he 's ' excited about the challenge ' @entity20 's 66 was the lowest round of a cold , damp day , while @entity18 birdied two of the last three holes for a 68 in his first appearance in a @entity3 event			1
@entity0 wears gloves on a cold , wet day in @entity5 as he holds onto his lead @entity22 had been @entity0 's closest challenger when he birdied the second and third and then almost holed his approach to the 603 - yard eighth hole for an albatross , but missed the eagle putt from five feet and had to settle for a birdie			1
the left - hander then made a costly mistake on the 10th when his simple approach to the green plugged in a bunker , from where he could only blast out to 40 feet and three - putt for a double bogey			0
but after dropping another shot on the 12th , @entity22 birdied four of the last five holes , marred only by a three - putt bogey on the 17th			1
' i played reasonably solid today , ' said @entity0 , who has yet to win a @entity3 title			2
' i thought conditions were a little bit more difficult , colder , obviously a little bit of overnight rain made the golf course play a little bit longer			0
' i did n't quite score as well as i did the last couple days but really gave myself some confidence from a ball - striking point of view that i can get the job done tomorrow			0
@entity0 thought he played ' reasonably solidly ' in difficult conditions despite his lead diminishing while not matching his previous day 's efforts , @entity0 takes confidence into the fourth round @entity19 's @entity18 , the world no 127 , is in second and making his presence known ' and let 's be honest			1
yes , i had a three - shot lead overnight and it 's only one now , but i 'll take this position any week that you offer it to me , a one - shot lead going into the last round on a golf course that i enjoy			1
' i am excited about the challenge tomorrow and really looking forward to it			0
' it would be huge to win but i can accept whatever happens			0
i feel like i am turning the corner from a lot of points of view , mentally , physically and in my personal life a lot of good things are going on			0
' i am excited about another opportunity to win a golf tournament			0
if it happens i will be very happy , if not things are moving in the right direction			0
' @entity94 's @entity20 shot a third day 66 , the lowest round of a cold and damp day in @entity96 @entity0 admitted had never heard of nearest challenger @entity18 before this week , but the world number 127 revealed he is quite well known in his native @entity19			1
' i 'm kind of relatively short tempered , so i always focus not to get too angry at myself , ' @entity18 said			2
' i believe i 'm doing pretty good at that at the moment , so i just want to keep that going			0
' asked if he usually got angry quickly , @entity18 added : ' i 'm pretty famous for that in @entity19			2
' @entity13 champion @entity20 could be @entity0 's biggest threat given his record at the venue , the @entity94 shot a closing 63 on his way to victory three years ago and also holds the course record of 62			1
in an up and down day , @entity22 birdied four of the last five holes to be tied for third on nine - under ' finally i could make some putts today , that was nice , ' the 29 - year - old said			1
' the first two days i played really well but the putter was a little cold			0
' today i make a couple mid-distance putts , only one bogey so i think i put myself in a good position			0
' obviously you need a little help from @entity0 in order to win , but i 'm playing really well and that 's all i can do			2
' world number 10 @entity119 and @entity122 @entity121 are three off the lead on eight under par , with last year 's runner - up @entity125 and @entity128 's @entity127 another shot back			2
@entity125 had been in second place at halfway but could only manage a third round of 72 .			0

@entity0 one - shot in front for final round of @entity11
@entity18 is second with @entity20 and @entity22 two back
@entity20 's 66 was the best round on a cold and wet day in @entity5
@entity0 had taken a three - shot into day three with his second 67
