staff in at least 17 hospitals have been secretly banned from wearing veils , an investigation has found			2
front - line nhs staff , including doctors and nurses , have been told they can not wear a niqab – a full veil which covers the face – while in contact with patients			1
some hospitals have gone as far as to say veils can not be worn in any situation where communication is essential – including staff training			2
ministers last night called for guidelines to ensure all patients can have ‘ face - to - face ’ contact with those who care for them			1
staff in at least 17 @entity26 hospitals have been secretly banned from wearing veils , an investigation has revealed ( file pic ) in light of the findings by the @entity32 , the government ordered a review of all health service policies on workers ’ uniforms			1
regulators will be asked to draw up clear rules so that communication with patients is always given priority over the right of a nurse or doctor to wear a veil			1
the move comes at a time of increased public debate over @entity51 head - dress , following the decision by a college in @entity54 to scrap a ban on veils amid protests from students			2
@entity59 has indicated he would support public sector bodies wishing to ban staff from covering their faces			0
and earlier this week @entity64 said there were certain circumstances where it was ‘ perfectly reasonable for us to say the full veil is clearly not appropriate ’			1
@entity69 have called for a national debate			0
there are 160 @entity26 trusts in @entity73 , all of which have no national guidance on uniform policies			1
@entity78 and @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity87 @entity86 ’s @entity85 of @entity89 ’s @entity88 , @entity93 general @entity91 - east @entity90 the vast majority leave such decisions to the discretion of local managers			0
in some cases , uniform policies specifically state that the veil can be worn by front - line staff for religious reasons			1
but 17 @entity26 hospitals had clear policies stating that front - line staff should not be allowed to cover their faces while in direct contact with patients			1
some went even further , to say that face veils should not be worn in situations where communication is essential , such as training			0
many of the hospitals which have introduced explicit restrictions are in parts of the country that have high @entity51 populations , such as @entity120 , and @entity121 and @entity122 in @entity123			0
dr @entity124 , the health minister , has ordered a review of all current healthcare guidance on the issue			2
he said : ‘ i am proud of the rich ethnic diversity of our healthcare workforce and support appropriate religious and cultural freedoms , but a vital part of good patient care is effective verbal and non-verbal communication			0
‘ being unable to see a healthcare professional ’s face can be a barrier to good and empathetic communication with patients and their families			2
' that is why i am writing to all healthcare regulators to ask them to look into this matter and to review their professional regulations , to ensure that there is always appropriate face to face contact between healthcare professionals and their patients			1
’ the policy , drawn up by @entity153 , which runs @entity154 and @entity155 , states : ‘ to ensure effective communication , clothing which covers the face ( veil / niqab ) is not permitted for any staff in contact with patients , carers or visitors or for staff in other roles where clear face to face communication is essential , for example , training			1
’ staff who wish to wear a veil when they are not working – such as in breaks , or during their lunch , or walking around the buildings – are told they may do so			1
however they should be prepared to remove their veil if asked to check their identity against their @entity178 badge , according to the guidance drawn up last year			0
@entity181 , @entity182 and @entity26 trust , which runs three hospitals in the @entity184 says face coverings should not be worn when delivering patient care in order to aid communication and minimise infection risks			2
dr @entity190 , the @entity190 mp for @entity191 in @entity192 and a former gp , said : ‘ i think the same rules should apply to everyone : if i chose to wear a balaclava to work that would not be acceptable			0
‘ there are many areas – the courts , schools and hospitals – where the veil is simply not appropriate because you need clear communication			0
debate : @entity207 said it was ' totally wrong ' for @entity51 schools to force pupils to wear veils and burkas yesterday , the mayor of @entity120 said it was ‘ totally wrong ’ for @entity51 schools to force pupils as young as 11 to wear veils and burkas			0
@entity207 said they should not be compulsory , adding : ‘ i do n’t think it can be classed as any kind of uniform			0
that is against my principles and it ’s against the principles of liberty that @entity120 should stand for			0
’ a row broke out after it was claimed that some independent secondary schools order girls to wear burkas outside school and headscarves in class			0
two @entity120 schools , the £ 3,000 - a - year @entity234 in @entity235 and the £ 1,900 - a - year @entity236 in @entity237 , were both said to enforce strict @entity51 uniform policies			2
but teachers at @entity240 last night said the rules had been misinterpreted and that pupils were not forced to wear full - face veils .			1
