by @entity0 one team is headed for the @entity3 finals , the other for the beach			1
but the gulf between the @entity7 and @entity8 is wider than the @entity9 they have crossed for their friendly in the @entity12 in @entity13 on tuesday morning			1
@entity8 are ranked fourth in the world , with @entity7 provisionally ranked 70 places lower — a gap in class that @entity19 ’s makeshift crew will struggle to bridge			1
it was n’t always like this but the rivalry of the 2002 @entity3 qualifiers , which saw two draws , and the friendly win for @entity7 in 2005 , seems a distant haze now			1
opposition : @entity7 manager @entity19 hopes @entity8 provide a challenge @entity29 , @entity8 have @entity30 as their poster boy while @entity7 have @entity32 , a @entity30 fan to the extent he voted for him as @entity34			1
everyone thinks highly of @entity30 , who will figure after overcoming injury , and even @entity37 holds his former @entity39 colleague in high esteem as ‘ a player and person ’ , according to @entity19			1
in a city of stars , few are burning brighter than @entity30 , who is the chief reason 50,000 fans are converging on @entity48 ( 7.45pm local time )			1
they expect to see the gaily bedecked @entity51 galleons scuttle the hand - crafted @entity53 currachs in a froth of goals			2
and even @entity19 , by instinct an optimist , is aware of the challenge confronting his under - strength side			1
‘ i would imagine this probably would be our toughest game of these four , ’ he said			2
‘ obviously , @entity8 in their last game before the @entity3 — i do n’t know what way they will approach it and whether they would risk @entity30 in the game — but for us , it ’s still a big test			1
‘ i would just like to finish on a high if we can and to get a really good performance , something akin to the @entity70 performance , and to try to finish the off - season on a decent note			2
’ anticipation : @entity30 is expected to return to the @entity8 line - up for the game @entity19 is eager that @entity30 plays , which may be courting trouble			1
‘ he is one of the top two players in the world			0
he ’s just a brilliant , brilliant player , ’ he added			0
‘ we had a few problems the other night ( against @entity82 ) at the beginning of the second half of the game for about 15 or 20 minutes when ( @entity87 ) @entity86 came out wide and caused us a few problems , so you could imagine @entity30 being in that sort of form			1
‘ it should be great for us to want to go and play against him			0
i think the players want him to be playing in the game so they can go and test themselves			1
i think a game like this benefits the younger players to be around the senior lads and encourages them not to be fearful when it comes to the big matches			2
’ technical ability : @entity102 could be recalled from the bench and his passing style could trouble @entity8 @entity19 , who will attend @entity8 ’s opening @entity108 game against @entity109 next monday , could do with a positive result as one win in six games has seen the @entity53 ranking plummet			1
‘ we just keep dropping down , do n’t we ? ’ he said , before adding a light touch			0
‘ i told you , we ’re going to choose some new countries at home to play in the middle of our season , and their off - season , and we ’ll try and force a 1 - 0 win			2
‘ it ’ll raise us up those rankings , to give us a chance in the 2028 @entity3 , you know			1
’ @entity19 was guarded about his selection yesterday but his back five will consist entirely of @entity129 players , which would be a worry			2
@entity102 is expected to return after being on the bench against @entity82 and his svelte passing game , may unhinge the @entity51 defence			1
unconcerned : @entity19 made light of @entity7 's dramatic drop in the @entity34 rankings to 70th place @entity19 did n’t regard it as coincidence that @entity102 did n’t start the two games where @entity7 lacked a creative sparkle , against @entity142 and @entity82			1
‘ i do n’t think that is the case , i do n’t look at it like that			0
when i get back home and really analyse things , then there might be a pattern			0
but i have not looked that deeply into it			0
’ @entity32 is eager to play and put his penalty aberration against @entity82 behind him			0
that ’s the way it goes			0
i ’m not one to dwell on things , ’ said @entity32			0
‘ you want to score			0
when you do n’t you feel you let people down but you ’ ve got to get on with it			0
after the game it was forgotten			0
if he goes the other way , is it a good penalty ? listen , he saved it , that ’s the way it goes			0
’ would he take one tomorrow if on the field ? ‘ of course , ’ he said			0
uncharacteristic : @entity32 is not overly upset by his penalty miss for @entity170 against @entity82 @entity19 has a concern over the fitness of @entity173 who has a back problem and took it easy in training yesterday where a lightweight squad was joined by @entity178 , the 23 - year - old reserve goalkeeper for @entity179 , who is eligible for the @entity7 through his @entity53 grandfather			1
‘ it was the first time i saw him live and i ’d need to see a bit more of him , obviously , ’ said @entity19			2
‘ @entity186 ( @entity187 ) has put a couple of dvds in front of my nose which i have n’t had a chance to look at properly			0
‘ it would be very hard to make an assessment today on a 15 - minute each - way game			2
but i ’ll definitely keep an eye on him , ’ he added			0
the courting of @entity199 highlights the shortage of top class keepers and puts the position of @entity203 in focus , especially after a slightly uncertain contribution against @entity82			0
@entity203 has thrived on the big occasions , such as against @entity207 10 days ago when he was busy early on			0
he may be busier for a lot longer against @entity8			2
under threat : @entity203 's place in the @entity7 goal is by no means assured after some shaky displays			1

@entity7 manager looking forward to tough @entity8 test
@entity30 expected to return for final @entity3 warm - up game
@entity19 *shrugs* off @entity7 's drop in @entity34 rankings to 70th place
@entity7 could name young , *inexperienced* side to face @entity8
