bulletproof vests have offered protection for people 's bodies for years , but they 're of little use if an assailant aims at the wearer 's head			1
while bulletproof helmets are typically heavy , conspicuous and expensive			0
now , one designer claims to have found a solution			0
he has created a lightweight , ' stylish ' baseball cap that can repel a range of ammunition			1
called bulletsafe its hard panel makes the cap bulletproof against all handguns up to a @entity23 ( @entity22 )			1
however , the protective panel is only located in the front of the cap , meaning the sides and the back are not protected however , the protective panel is only located in the front of the cap , meaning the sides and the back of the head are not protected			1
the hard panel makes the cap bulletproof against all handguns up to a @entity23 ( @entity22 )			2
it is inserted behind the front third of the baseball cap , fits close to the wearer 's forehead and is made of high - strength material usually used in ballistic plates to stop rifle fire			1
the cap 's inventor , @entity41 from @entity43 , @entity16 described it as ' a much friendlier form of protection than a helmet '			1
the 44 - year - old said : ' in this case , the panel will be thinner than rifle plates and will be used to stop handgun rounds , which typically have about a quarter of the ballistic energy of a rifle round			1
' when it is shot with a handgun it will stop the bullet with very little deformation			2
this will spread the energy of the bullet over the area of your forehead			0
' a powerful handgun like a @entity23 has about twice the energy as a hockey shot , so being shot in the head wearing this hat will hurt as much as being hit in your hockey helmet by two hockey snapshots at once			1
' it will hurt , but the difference between that and being shot in the head is immense			0
' the cap 's inventor described it as ' a much friendlier form of protection than a helmet '			1
a test of a prototype product is shown			0
the idea to create the bulletproof cap came about when @entity41 's company , @entity84 , was asked if it was going to introduce a line of ballistic helmets while the cap protects wearers at the front , the sides and back do n't contain bulletproof panels so provide no protection			1
however , the inventor said the cap is ' a much friendlier form of protection than a helmet '			1
the exact distance at which the cap can repel a bullet has not been revealed the idea to create the bulletproof cap came about when mr @entity41 's company , @entity84 , was asked if it was going to introduce a line of ballistic helmets			1
' the plate material is not new , it is being used in rifle plates today , but that side of the project required some calculation , ' continued mr @entity41			0

' the amount of energy in a handgun round is high , but not as high as some people seem to believe , ' the company wrote on its @entity122 page			2
' a @entity23 has about 450 joules of energy			0
a hockey snapshot has about 240			0
' so the amount of impact you would feel is on the order of twice the impact of being hit in the helmet with a hockey puck			1
' is that enough to give you a concussion ? ' it is certainly in that range , but a concussion would be a welcome outcome when compared to the damage a bullet would do to the same area without protection			2
' ' we built a firing prototype from some existing materials and tested it to make sure the concept worked and that a panel of our size would n't fold or buckle			2
' then we started working on making such a panel fit in the baseball cap			1
we have been working on it for about 11 months			0
' he continued that the firm will spend the next months building moulds and pressing the panels			0
they will then be tested to the current bulletproof standards before being put into production			0
the exact distance at which the cap can repel a bullet has not been revealed , and will depend on further development and testing			1
he said : ' our vests sell mainly to security guards and i could n't imagine walking into a bank and seeing a security guard wearing a ballistic helmet			1
' it just seemed ridiculous			0
i could see the need for some bulletproof protection for the head , but not a helmet			2
' in the @entity177 , some officers and guards wear baseball caps on duty			0
it is actually fairly common when they patrol outside as it keeps the sun out of their eyes			0
' most police departments try to dissuade officers from wearing sunglasses because they want them to be able to make eye contact with the public			0
' officers and guards usually wear neat looking , dark coloured hats			0
i decided to see what we could fit for ballistic protection inside one of those			2
' the cap is meant for police officers , security guards , and anyone who wants protection without intimidation			2
' from left to right is a polymer mock - up of the panel , a paper pattern , and a shooting sample made from a helmet section			2
mr @entity41 's @entity122 campaign for the headgear has already raised more than £ 4,800 ( $ 7,500 ) of its initial £ 2,250 ( $ 3,500 ) target when bullets strike the cap ( shown ) they do not penetrate as far as the wearer 's head , keeping them protected from shots that hit them straight on			1
the cap will be made publicly available near the end of 2015			0
a black version costs £ 83 ( $ 129 ) , but those backing the @entity122 project can buy one for £ 64 ( $ 99 ) mr @entity41 's @entity122 campaign for the headgear has already raised more than £ 4,800 ( $ 7,500 ) of its inital £ 2,250 ( $ 3,500 ) target			1
a black version of the cap costs £ 83 ( $ 129 ) , but those backing the @entity122 project are offered the hats at a discounted price of £ 64 ( $ 99 )			1
alternatively , @entity122 backers can pay £ 96 ( $ 149 ) for a custom hat in various colours and styles			1
the cap , which comes small , medium / large and extra large , is expected to be available in november this year			0
mr @entity41 said : ' when the caps are ready in late 2015 they will have been tested to stop most of the handguns people will see on the streets of the @entity177			0
' it will provide that level of protection over the front third of the baseball cap			1
the cap will save your life if you are shot in that area			0
' it will be bulletproof for all handguns up to a .45 @entity23			0
it is tested at a very short distance , but will work against further ones as well			0
; however , he added that the cap wo n't stop a bullet from most rifles			2
' the cap will be tested in an independent ballistics lab to a standard set forth by the @entity177 national institute of justice , who sets the standards for bulletproof vests and helmets , so everyone will be guaranteed that it works as promised			0

@entity16 - based company has designed a bulletproof baseball cap
called @entity84 , the hat has a built - in panel designed to stop bullets
impact is like being hit with ' two hockey pucks while wearing a helmet '
inventor claims the cap is ' friendlier ' than a *regular* ballistic helmet
however , there are no panels fitted to the back or sides for protection
the exact distance at which the cap can repel a bullet has not been revealed , and will depend on further development and testing
black version of bulletproof cap is available on @entity122 for £ 64 ( $ 99 )
