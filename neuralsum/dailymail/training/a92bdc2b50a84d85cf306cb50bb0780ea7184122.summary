by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 _ for the first time since the introduction of permanent shirt numbers , @entity2 find themselves without a number 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 and 15			2
this odd sequence has been brought about following a summer of departures , as @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 have all called time on their glittering careers at @entity16			1
it only underlines the size of the reconstruction job that @entity20 faces in the coming weeks as he attempts to rebuild his defence and add some stardust to the final third			0
fantastic talent : @entity24 , watched by @entity11 no 3 - @entity24 following the exit of @entity9 , the £ 31million @entity24 is likely be offered the no 3 shirt and @entity2 hope that it will be his to wear for the next fifteen years			1
he has already impressed @entity2 ’s coaching staff by returning to pre-season training one week early and he has also been given the seal of approval by @entity2 great @entity57 , who describes @entity24 as ‘ fantastic player with great pace ’			2
even before the departure of @entity9 to @entity61 on monday , @entity24 had been told that he would be the club ’s first - choice left back this season and it is a testament of @entity2 ’s confidence in this 19 - year - old that he may start the season as @entity2 ’s only player in this position			1
@entity71 has also left for @entity72 , leaving @entity24 unchallenged , but @entity2 are considering a move for another left - back , although @entity75 , if he is signed , would offer cover in that position			2
no 5 - @entity78 / @entity75 / @entity79 @entity80 has identified @entity84 @entity83 winner @entity81 as his prime defensive target but there is also a realistic recognition that it may be difficult to cut a deal with @entity89 this summer			1
the @entity90 also remains keen to sign @entity91 defender @entity75 who , at 28 , offers @entity44 experience			0
the player is understood to have agreed a wage package in principle with @entity2 and he is hopeful of completing a move to the club this summer			2
@entity78 amazing : @entity84 @entity83 winning defender @entity81 , with his girlfriend @entity99 @entity100 will continue to spend - @entity101 only last week , @entity75 was pictured holidaying with @entity2 forward @entity102 and the pair ’s great friendship , forged at @entity91 , is believed be one factor that has persuaded the @entity106 to push for the move			1
@entity109 , however , is proving a troublesome stumbling block and even though the player ’s contract is set to expire in 12 months time , the @entity91 boss is reluctant to allow another defender to leave following the exit of @entity115 to @entity116			0
if a replacement can be found - or if @entity2 offer a player as a makeweight - a deal should be done			0
@entity79 is also expected to arrive at @entity16 and a deal worth £ 8.5m could be struck in the coming weeks			0
no 7 - @entity123 / @entity122 / @entity121 the iconic shirt worn with such distinction by @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 has now been vacant for 12 months after @entity36 felt his performances were suffering due to the pressure of the responsibility and reverted to his favoured no 25			1
as things stand , @entity2 have prioritised reinforcing the defensive and midfield positions , although a move for @entity137 ’s @entity123 or @entity139 ’s @entity138 is not out of the question			1
up for grabs : @entity123 looks set to leave @entity137 after @entity143 's arrival at the @entity144 many within the club are also keen for the honour to be handed to @entity121 , although his close relationship with @entity11 could see him take the @entity149 shirt			1
it may be a case of waiting until next summer when a star name can be brought in			0
time to step up : united forward @entity153 no 9 - @entity153 the no 9 shirt has brought underwhelming stints from @entity156 and @entity35 in recent times after happier days with @entity158 and @entity159			2
this shirt number has been absent since the departure of @entity35 in 2012 and with a striker unlikely to arrive this summer , @entity2 may feel that the time is right to promote @entity164 forward @entity153 from 19 to 9 as the @entity80 era dawns at @entity16			1
no 11 - @entity121 the shirt worn by @entity11 for over twenty trophy - laden years now needs filling			1
@entity11 himself does not want the shirt number retired , although it is believed to have been suggested as a tribute by some			0
@entity2 , however , are taking the view that they should produce one great player after another and that it should be seen as an honour to follow in @entity11 ' footsteps			2
@entity121 leaned heavily on the current assistant manager for advice last season and the two worked closely on the training ground			0
he is the one player at the club with the potential to step into the @entity187 ’s shoes			0
wing wizard : @entity121 has the outrageous talent to follow in @entity11 's footstepds no 15 - @entity191 blind was a star performer for @entity80 at the @entity83 with @entity194 and as the @entity90 prefers to operate with a smaller squad of around 22 or 23 players , the @entity199 man ’s versatility appeals greatly			1
@entity191 , who would cost around £ 14m , would offer cover for @entity24 at left back and also act as a useful stop - gap in central midfield as @entity203 recovers from injury			0
he has also earned a reputation as a big - match player , successfully carrying out a fierce man - marking job on @entity209 in @entity194 ’s 2 - 0 win over @entity211 in @entity212			0
@entity90 of class : @entity191 's rich potential was clear to see at the @entity83 in @entity212			0

@entity80 has *inherited* a squad which has lost key players
@entity2 have lost @entity11 , @entity9 , @entity12 and @entity10 this summer
@entity78 and @entity123 are on @entity2 's shopping list
@entity153 and @entity121 could step up from within squad
