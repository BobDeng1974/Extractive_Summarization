@entity0 , @entity1 , @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 : you , as well as dozens of other selfie - snapping celebs , have been put on notice by the recently formed @entity8 , which is now charging one dollar for each pompous portrait posted on social media websites			1
but self - centered celebs are n't the only targets of the @entity15 's new self - portrait patrol - anyone with a penchant for excessively posting selfies on the web could be hit with a one - dollar ' fine ' from the group			1
but it gets even better - it 's for a good cause			1
new sheriff in @entity22 : you may want to think twice before sharing that selfie on social media - you could be fined on notice : the group has targeted some of the most self - obsessed celebs as its ' most wanted ' selfie offenders the organization was formed by a group of students from @entity33 , and all of the profits from the ' fines ' handed out for posting selfies online are donated to @entity38 , a charitable organization that tries to fight world poverty by giving student loans to college - aged kids in third - world countries			1
the ' fines , ' of course , are n't actual fines - they serve as an innovative way to ask for donations to a good cause by using one of the biggest phenomenons to hit the self - obsessed world of social media : the selfie			1
' when we first came up with the idea we were trying to think of how to engage our generation in giving , ' co-creator @entity57 tells the website petapixel.com			0
' it ’s tricky because we ’re such a selfish generation , so the question we asked was not how do we make our generation charitable , but how do we turn selfishness into charity			0
that ’s where @entity65 was born			0
' a good cause : the ' fines ' the group collects go towards giving college loans to kids in third - world countries the organization encourages people to ' accuse ' their social media friends and family of selfie violations in one of three ways : funny , snotty or mean			1
anyone who goes the funny route will post ' omg you are so beautiful ! and nice ! that ’s why i knew you would pay up at selfiepolice.org # selfiepolice ' underneath the offender 's selfie			1
those who choose snotty will post ' thanks for that selfie i almost forgot what you looked like ! looks like you owe a dollar to the # selfiepolice selfiepolice.org			2
' anyone who wants to get mean with their accusations are asked to post ' eh , nice selfie			2
use a better filter next time so i ca n’t actually tell what you look like			0
pay up at selfiepolice.org # selfiepolice ' under the self - centered photo			2
the url address will direct offenders to the @entity8 website , where they are greeted with an explanatory message			0
wanted : @entity2 is one of the world 's most notorious selfie offenders - and she 's got the cash to pay a lot of ' fines ' ' on behalf of humanity , you are hereby fined $ 1 per selfie on charges of self - obsession			1
all the money goes to fund education for kids who ca n’t afford college , let alone a $ 600 self - indulgence device , ' the message on the website says			2
' donate and join us			0
there ’s a lot of work to be done			0
together we can turn vanity into charity			0
' so far , the organization has raised a little more than $ 1,400			0
