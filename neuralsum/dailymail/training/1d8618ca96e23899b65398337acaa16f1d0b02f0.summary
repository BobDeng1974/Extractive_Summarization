by @entity0 given the storm unleashed by her ' racist ' tapes of @entity6 boss @entity5 , you could n't blame @entity7 for wanting to keep a low profile			1
but someone should probably tell her that wearing a huge black visor to dinner and then playing with her pet turtle for the cameras is n't the best way			2
the 31 - year - old model , who taped the @entity17 owner berating her for hanging around with black players , took her inimitable fashion sense to new heights at a dinner last night in @entity22			1
since the @entity52 scandal broke she has taken it out rollerblading , to a car wash and into a nail salon			0
she even left it on while giving a homeless man $ 40			0
but although the model and self - styled philanthropist lives in a $ 1.8million condo near @entity62 , her fashion sense is available to all - as the garish shields cost just $ 12.50 on @entity64			0
fashion sense : @entity7 was dressed all in black she arrived with her entourage at @entity39 restaurant koi dressed all in black and with a @entity69 tote bag			1
@entity7 refers to herself only as @entity32 and says she was not @entity5 's lover but his ' archivist '			1
she made headlines worldwide after a tape allegedly of the @entity17 owner was leaked to the media			0
in the tape he is apparently heard attacking her for publicly befriending black @entity6 players like @entity79			2
' it bothers me a lot that you want to broadcast that you ’re associating with black people			0
do you have to ? ' @entity5 allegedly says			2
' i ’m just saying , in your lousy f * * * * * * * @entity86 , you do n’t have to have yourself with , walking with black people			0
' do n't put him ( @entity79 ) on an @entity89 for the world to have to see so they have to call me			0
and do n't bring him to my games			0
' @entity95 , 80 , is battling prostate cancer and has already outlived the life expectancy given to him by doctors , @entity93 and the @entity94 reported today			2
he is fighting the forced sale of his team after being banned from the @entity6 for life			1
yesterday a panel of 10 fellow @entity6 team owners or representatives unanimously agreed to proceed ' as expeditiously as possible , ' the @entity6 said			1
the decision was reached during a conference call of the association 's advisory - finance committee			0
on tuesday @entity5 was banned from the @entity6 for life and fined $ 2.5million - the league maximum			1
roll with it : whatever people have said about the 31 - year - old 's fashion sense , it has certainly drawn attention philanthropist : @entity7 , complete with her visor , gives $ 40 to a homeless man outside a nail bar yesterday			1
