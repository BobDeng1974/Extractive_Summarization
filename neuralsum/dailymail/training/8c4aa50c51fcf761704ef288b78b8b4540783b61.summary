by @entity1 reporter published : 18:13 est , 3 june 2013 updated : 18:20 est , 3 june 2013 after a @entity4 committee revealed last month that @entity5 skirted billions in taxes by stashing cash in offshore tax havens , the company quickly became the poster child of big businesses that take advantage of dramatically lower corporate tax rates around the world			1
but it turns out @entity5 is n't alone - according to a new report , 18 of the largest companies in the @entity17 avoid paying @entity17 taxes in the exact same way , dodging an estimated $ 92 billion , collectively			0
according to the report , conducted by the tax - advocacy organization @entity21 , 18 of the @entity17 ' @entity23 companies - like @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 - disclose information in their annual financial reports that indicates that they keep billions of dollars in profits offshore where corporate tax rates can be in single - digit percentages			1
in the @entity37 , for example , the corporate tax rate is zero			0
if the companies were to keep their money in the @entity17 , they would be subject to corporate tax rates ranging from 30 - percent to 39 - percent			1
@entity5 ceo @entity42 explains to @entity43 how the company stashes billions of dollars in profits to avoid paying @entity17 corporate income tax the @entity21 says places like @entity48 and the @entity49 are likely the locations of choice for many of the tax - skirting corporations to stash their money			1
under current @entity17 tax code , large corporations can indefinitely defer paying @entity17 income taxes on their offshore profits			0
it 's not until the money is repatriated that the @entity17 can apply any taxes to any corporate profits - and that 's assuming that these corporations ever bring the money back to the @entity17 even when the money is brought back into the country , corporations rarely pay the full corporate tax rate on profits they 've kept offshore to the @entity17 - companies are allowed a “ foreign tax credit ” against their @entity17 tax when and if the profits are subject to @entity17 tax			2
this means that a company that pays a 25 - percent tax rate on income it 's kept offshore - to a foreign government - would only have to pay a 10 - percent tax rate if it brings the money back into the @entity17			2
@entity81 ! but the @entity21 also found that 22 companies that do n't disclose where they keep their money hold an estimated $ 720 billion in un-repatriated income			0
topping that list is @entity86 , which holds roughly $ 110 billion in places like the @entity37 , @entity48 , @entity88 and @entity89			1
@entity90 got the number two spot , with $ 73 billion spread between @entity88 , @entity48 , the @entity49 and several other low - tax nations			1
because stashing money in places that have low corporate income tax rates is n't illegal , and because the @entity98 of these companies report to stockholders , business experts have said that for a company to not squirrel money away in places with low tax rates would be the equivalent of corporate malpractice			2
but lawmakers are attempting to fix the loopholes that allows these companies to duck paying taxes			0
several of the corporations on the @entity21 's list have suggested granting a holiday on taxes for companies that want to repatriate their income that 's currently being kept overseas .			0

some of the @entity17 ' largest corporations keep much of their profits in places like @entity88 , the @entity37 and the @entity49 , where corporate tax rates can be as low as zero
@entity86 holds roughly $ 110 billion in places like the @entity37 , @entity48 , @entity88 and @entity89
@entity17 corporate tax rates range from 30 - percent to 39 - percent
