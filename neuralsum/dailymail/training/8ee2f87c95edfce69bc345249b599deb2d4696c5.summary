given @entity1 's familial relations and work history , it has been noted that it seems disingenuous to take critical stance on a culture that she herself helped create			2
in @entity25 , a picture book illustrated by @entity49 , a small girl named @entity25 who apparently spends all her time on social media - she ' knows how to tap			1
to share ' - has her @entity52 taken away from her by her mother			2
and in @entity54 , @entity1 covers how technology relates to etiquette , privacy , family and career , with tips and anecdotes interspersed			1

if i had n't had a son , i 'd probably still be there working 90 hours a week on projects , and be happy there			0
' and writing her books she reveals how she relished the chance to turn off the technology			2
' gradually , over the course of a month , i loved being unreachable , ' she told the paper			0
' i saw that the world did n't end if i waited to respond to an e-mail in six hours , rather than six minutes			0
' as someone who has committed her fair share of social media faux pas , @entity1 feels she 's uniquely qualified to write about navigating technology			1
new book : @entity10 's guide to navigating our increasingly connected world ' personally , along with being part of the team that built @entity11 from early on , i also grew up on social media , ' she told @entity103			1
' if people can learn from my mistakes , or feel more of a sense of connection with what i ’m saying because i ’ve shown some vulnerability , then i think we ’re at a better starting point			0
' among other suggestions , @entity1 writes , in a sentiment many will agree with , ' just because you can document your every waking moment does n’t mean you should			0
' she told the @entity69 that she never intended to be a social media doyenne , but found that the same questions kept arising everywhere she went			1
' i did a lot of public speaking last year , and no matter where i went , people always asked the same questions : how can i better understand what my children are doing online ? how can i ask my significant other not to immediately reach for their tablet in bed ? how can i make sure i do n't lose my job to someone who is younger and more tech - savvy ? ' she gathered their business cards and launched a newsletter , @entity54 , to address those topics			2
many of those thoughts have been collected in the book , of which she says her family , including her brother @entity1 , approves			1

attached : like many girl her age , @entity25 loves technology - especially her tablet time to play : when @entity25 's tablet is taken away , she 's challenged to find other ways to have fun recharged : but dot soon finds other activities - like painting and playing with her dog - that entertain her just as much @entity1 says the idea for the children 's book came after talking with other parents who were worried about the affect new technology is having on the quality of their children 's lives			1
a lot , ' explains ms @entity10 on her blog			0
' she 's obsessed with her devices ( sound familiar ? ) , but with a little push , she 's reminded that life 's a little bit richer when you look up from a screen			0
' this is a topic close to home for ms @entity10 , who has a toddler of her own , son @entity182 , with husband @entity183			0
' as i watch my two - year - old begin to discover technology , i feel certain that this is an important message to share with a younger audience , ' she said .			0
