hospitals should let more elderly patients die , a top cardiologist has claimed hospitals should let more elderly patients die , a top cardiologist has claimed			1
dr @entity5 believes that doctors resuscitate too many older people because society does not see enough death , leaving many people unwilling to accept mortality			1
he pointed out that frail pensioners routinely receive hospital medical interventions such as flu jabs which are designed to prolong life , but not necessarily improve it			0
the cardiologist said that when it comes to resuscitating the elderly , particularly those with dementia , patients ’ quality of life should be given more consideration and more people should be allowed to die			1
‘ if a person is in hospital , particularly an elderly person with multiple co-morbidities , if they have a cardiac arrest it ’s a sign they are in decline , ’ he told @entity25			1
‘ it ’s their act of dying and they should not be resuscitated , they should be allowed to die			0
’ dr @entity5 , who works at the @entity41 in @entity42 , explained that the chance of an elderly person leaving hospital after being resuscitated is around 5 per cent			1
but he said the issue was a difficult one because people today are less likely to think and talk about death thanks to advancements in modern medicine , which mean that people are living longer			0
‘ society these days is much less familiar with death , ’ he said , adding : ‘ our great - grandparents and to some extent our grandparents grew up with people dying before the days of antibiotics			0
‘ that ’s denied these days			0
@entity62 is now becoming something in hospitals and care homes , somewhere removed from the family and the home			0
’ he went on to say : ‘ we need to make it a more natural expectation			0
life is 100 per cent mortality and we need to get used to that			0
’ family doctors are taking up valuable consultation time asking patients to sign petitions demanding extra cash for their surgeries , it emerged last night			1
dr @entity5 believes that doctors resuscitate too many older people because society does not see enough death , leaving many people unwilling to accept mortality ( file picture ) the average consultation is just seven minutes long			1
but despite claiming they often do not have enough time to listen to patients ’ problems , some gps have been using consultations to drum up support for extra funding			2
the move follows an email from the @entity96 , which urged practices to get as many patients ’ names as possible to bolster their campaign			2
@entity101 , a @entity102 member of the @entity104 health select committee , said : ‘ it ’s staggering that @entity87 claim to not have enough time to complete consultations with patients , but they can find time to get patients to sign petitions			2
‘ i doubt many patients feel comfortable saying no. this is a clear abuse of their position , especially as i suspect that with greater funding would come calls for even greater gp salaries			2
