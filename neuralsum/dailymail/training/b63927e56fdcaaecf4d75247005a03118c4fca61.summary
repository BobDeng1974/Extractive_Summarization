by @entity0 last updated at 7:42 am on 9th december 2011 in northern @entity5 , in a busy residential neighborhood minutes from the centre of @entity4 's capital city , is a secret that the @entity4 government has tried for years to protect			1
for years , the @entity8 used a government building - codenamed @entity9 - as a makeshift prison for its most valuable detainees			2
there , it held @entity17 operatives @entity15 , the mastermind of 9/11 , and others in a basement prison before they were ultimately transferred to @entity21 in 2006 , according to former @entity23 intelligence officials			1
the former prison was located and details learned of the facility where harsh interrogation tactics were used			2
a programme on the @entity8 prison will air on december 8			2
the @entity4 prison was part of a network of so - called black sites that the @entity8 operated and controlled overseas in @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46			1
all the prisons were closed by may 2006 , and the @entity8 's detention and interrogation program ended in 2009			0
unlike the @entity8 's facility in @entity45 's countryside or the one hidden in a @entity46 military installation , the @entity8 's prison in @entity4 was not in a remote location			1
it was hidden in plain sight , a couple blocks off a major boulevard on a street lined with trees and homes , along busy train tracks			0
the building is used as the @entity26 for @entity27 , which is also known as @entity28			0
classified information from @entity64 and the @entity65 is stored there			0
former intelligence officials both described the location of the prison and identified pictures of the building			1
in an interview at the building in november , senior @entity28 official @entity71 said the basement is one of the most secure rooms in all of @entity4			1
but he said @entity23 never ran a prison there			2
@entity79 mastermind @entity15 , pictured shortly after his capture during a raid in @entity82 in 2009 , was held at the site in @entity5 ' no , no. @entity84 , impossible , ' he said in an @entity86 interview for its ' @entity88 ' news broadcast , as a security official monitored the interview			1
the @entity8 prison opened for business in the fall of 2003 , after the @entity8 decided to empty the black site in @entity46 , according to former @entity23 officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to discuss the detention program with reporters			1
shuttling detainees into the facility without being seen was relatively easy			0
after flying into @entity5 , the detainees were brought to the site in vans			2
@entity8 operatives then drove down a side road and entered the compound through a rear gate that led to the actual prison			2
the detainees could then be unloaded and whisked into the ground floor of the prison and into the basement			1
the basement consisted of six prefabricated cells , each with a clock and arrow pointing to @entity120 , the officials said			2
the cells were on springs , keeping them slightly off balance and causing disorientation among some detainees			0
the @entity8 declined to comment on the prison			2
during the first month of their detention , the detainees endured sleep deprivation and were doused with water , slapped or forced to stand in painful positions , several former officials said			2
waterboarding was not performed in @entity4 , they said			1
overlooked : a view of the @entity8 ' prison ' in @entity5 showing how near it is to a busy railway line a satellite image showing the residential area and transport links surrounding the secret black site after the initial interrogations , the detainees were treated with care , the officials said			1
the prisoners received regular dental and medical check - ups			0
the @entity8 shipped in @entity150 food to the site from @entity152 , @entity153 , the agency 's @entity154 center for operations			2
halal meat is prepared under religious rules similar to kosher food			0
former @entity23 officials said that because the building was a government installation , it provided excellent cover			0
the prison did n't need heavy security because area residents knew it was owned by the government			2
people would n't be inclined to snoop in post-communist @entity4 , with its extensive security apparatus known for spying on the country 's own citizens			1
human rights activists have urged the eastern @entity154 countries to investigate the roles their governments played in hosting the prisons in which interrogation techniques such as waterboarding were used			0
officials from these countries continue to deny these prisons ever existed			0
' we know of the criticism , but we have no knowledge of this subject , ' @entity4 president @entity182 said in a september interview with @entity0 a floor plan setting out the rooms where alleged torture took place right in the heart of @entity4 's capital city the @entity8 has tried to close the book on the detention program , which @entity196 ended shortly after taking office			1
' that controversy has largely subsided , ' the @entity8 's top lawyer , @entity198 , said at a conference earlier this month			0
but details of the prison network continue to trickle out through investigations by international bodies , journalists and human rights groups			1
' there have been years of official denials , ' said @entity209 , a @entity210 lawmaker who led an investigation into the @entity8 secret prisons for the @entity213			0
' we are at last beginning to learn what really happened in @entity5			0
' during the @entity213 's investigation , @entity4 's foreign affairs minister assured investigators in a written report that , ' no public official or other person acting in an official capacity has been involved in the unacknowledged deprivation of any individual , or transport of any individual while so deprived of their liberty			1
' that report also described several other government investigations into reports of a secret @entity8 prison in @entity4 and said : ' no such activities took place on @entity4 territory			1
' ' we know of the criticism , but we have no knowledge of this subject ' journalists and human rights investigators have previously used flight records to tie @entity4 to the secret prison program			1
flight records for a @entity245 known to be used by the @entity8 showed a flight from @entity46 to @entity5 in september 2003			1
among the prisoners on board , according to former @entity8 officials , were @entity250 and @entity251 , who has been implicated in the bombing of the @entity253			0
later , other detainees - @entity255 , @entity256 and @entity257 - were also moved to @entity4			1
a deceptive @entity258 , who was taken to the prison in june 2005 , provided information that would later help the @entity8 identify @entity262 's trusted courier , a man who unwittingly led the @entity8 to @entity262 himself			0
court documents recently discovered in a lawsuit have also added to the body of evidence pointing to a @entity8 prison in @entity4			1
the files show @entity8 contractor @entity269 , a @entity271 - based charter company , operated flights to and from @entity4 along with other locations including @entity21 and @entity274			1
for the @entity8 officers working at the secret prison , the assignment was n't glamorous			0
the officers served 90 - day tours , slept on the compound and ate their meals there , too			0
officers were prevented from the leaving the base after their presence in the neighborhood stoked suspicion			0
one former officer complained that the @entity8 spent most of its time baby - sitting detainees like @entity255 and @entity250 whose intelligence value diminished as the years passed			0
the @entity4 and @entity45 sites were eventually closed in the first half of 2006 before cia director @entity291 left the job			1
some of the detainees were taken to @entity294 , where the @entity8 could legally hold them before they were sent to @entity21			0
others were sent back to their native countries .			0

location has never been made public
9/11 mastermind @entity15 one of those held in basement
part of the ' black site ' network which includes sites in @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46
@entity4 forced to deny the prison even exists
