as soon as we hit the bridge , i mean we came over the top and it was a sheet of ice , ' driver @entity19 told @entity26			2
' we saw cars every which way and tried to slow down and realized it was just total ice			2
i chose to go into the divider to slow down , and , you know , there was nothing i could do			0
bridges freeze faster than roads for two reasons			0
one is that they are exposed on all sides to the weather , which allows heat to escape faster			0
also , most bridges are made of steel and concrete which conducts heat more than asphalt making temperatures variable			0
those injured in the crash were bussed off the highway and taken to the hospital , while some lucky enough to drive off in their own cars recalled the scary situation			1
one driver says it was a ' miracle ' that her family did n't get hit			0
inventory : about 25 crashed cars were taken off the road and cataloged by police at a local lot caution : the accident happened on a bridge in @entity7			1
bridges freeze faster than roads because most are constructed with heat - conducing asphalt and they are being hit on all sides by the elements @entity86 : the @entity87 has advised drivers to stay at home for the time being due to the dangerous driving conditions ' i was trying to stop my car , but i was able to get around the tractor - trailer and stop my car and then try to just pull over because cars were kind of crashing up behind us			1
they have advised drivers to stay at home for the time being , due to the dangerous conditions on the roads			2
