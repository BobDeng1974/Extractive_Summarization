a @entity1 mother who buried her infant son alive has been convicted of capital murder - despite her lawyer 's arguments that she is mentally ill. @entity6 , 32 , was sentenced to life in prison thursday for the april 2010 murder of two - month - old @entity10			1
a jury in @entity12 , @entity1 , returned a guilty verdict after deliberating for two hours			1
prosecutor @entity14 told jurors that @entity6 never formed a bond with little @entity10 - a baby ' she never wanted and never loved			1
' @entity6 , 32 , showed no emotion as she was convicted of capital murder on thursday			1
she is pictured here during the opening of the trial earlier this month @entity6 , 32 , ( right ) was sentenced to life in prison for the april 2010 murder of two - month - old @entity10 ( left ) @entity6 , an @entity24 immigrant , showed no expression in court as she was found guilty - and again a short time later when district judge @entity27 sentenced her to life in prison			2
her lawyers had argued for the jury to convict her of the lesser charge of felony murder - saying she suffered from depression and bi-polar disorder			1
even the baby 's father asked for leniency			2
' if she is really sick and everything , which i think she is , she should not spend her life in prison and forever , ' @entity38 told @entity44			2
prosecutors argue @entity6 's actions were calculated - not the result of desperation due to mental illness			1
' she woke up on april 21 , 2010 and decided to kill @entity10 , ' assistant @entity50 district attorney @entity14 said in her opening statement either this month			0
' he was a child she never wanted and never loved			0
he was in her way			0
' the baby was her second child			0
he died after being buried face down in the mud outside @entity59 @entity12 's @entity58			1
attorney @entity60 believes his client 's mental state should be a mitigating factor in sentencing even if she is convicted at first , she claimed two men in a beige @entity67 kidnapped the boy while she walked him in a stroller			2
but according to the @entity72 , a neighbor told prosecutors they say her run and crash the stroller , with no baby in it , into a curb on purpose			0
she then allegedly called 911 to report the child missing			0
after speaking to her neighbors , authorities finally confronted @entity6 who took them to the baby 's grave			1
@entity60 promised to convince jurors his client was unstable with evidence from psychological evaluations , records of two suicide attempts in her teens , and on psychotic episode on the flight home from her native @entity24 that forced the plane to perform an emergency landing in @entity99			0
her mental health could be a mitigating factor in sentencing			0
if convicted of capital murder she will automatically be sentenced to life in prison			0
but if convicted of a lesser offense like murder , punishments could range from five years to life in prison .			2
