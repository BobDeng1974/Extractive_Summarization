@entity7 , 41 sailed at speeds of over 30mph and more than 18,000ft high for seven - and - a - half hours over the largest mountain ranges in the @entity10			1

mr @entity7 's wife , @entity37 , who is also a paraglider and photographer , joined her husband on his record - breaking flight , as she followed closely behind capturing his feat on camera			1
the paraglider , who now holds the @entity26 @entity25 , said he was thrilled			1
he said : ' my wife @entity45 is a paraglider pilot and she taught me the basics			2
' i love paragliding , the adrenaline , the danger , the remoteness , the freedom , the impossibility of it all			2
every single time i 'm in the air i ca n't believe what i 'm doing			2
' and it is by far and away the most intense and gratifying sport i have ever done			0
' i fly before i do anything else , and as much as possible			0
i 'm totally addicted , i 'm a junky			0
' this year , i flew in @entity61 and @entity62 for all of january , april through june in the @entity63			1
and we moved to @entity65 last year because in my opinion it 's the best big mountain paragliding site on @entity68			1
adrenaline junkie : @entity7 said he is addicted to the ' danger , remoteness , freedom ' of the sport and travels all over the world to take in the best views high - flyer : @entity7 sailed at speeds of over 30mph and more than 18,000ft high during the glide and said he was thrilled when he finally broke the record alien landscape : the paraglider said the area is ' untapped ' and the possibilities of over @entity84 are ' literally endless ' ' i never specifically set out to break the record			1
i 'm just always trying to fly as far as i can , taking routes that are challenging and interesting			0
' @entity88 is untapped - we have so few pilots in @entity84 compared with @entity91 that the possibilities are literally endless			0
' this was a huge flight , but it 's just cracking the surface of what 's possible			1
so every time i 'm in the air , if the weather presents a good day , i try to fly as far as i can			0
' the couple have paraglided around the world and have taken stunning photographs over the @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106			0
mr @entity7 said he needed to carry food and water during his record - breaking glide			1
he said : ' it 's very likely on these big flights that you could land an awfully long way from a road , so you 've got to be able to get yourself out			0
' the day before i broke the record , i 'd just achieved my personal best of 192 miles			1
and just a few days before that was another personal best of 159 miles			0
so it was a good week			0
' despite his love for the sport , mr @entity7 acknowledges how dangerous it can be			1
on a roll : in the week before the glide , @entity7 broke his personal best twice before finally smashing the @entity127 record dedication : @entity7 and his wife @entity24 , who is also a paraglider and photographer , have travelled across the world to pursue their love for the sport he said : ' you 're flying in extremely turbulent conditions in this part of the world , especially in the middle of the day when the thermals are cranking			1
at times i was in climbs that were in excess of 8 meters per second			0
@entity65 is known as one of the most demanding places to fly that there is			0
' this particular flight saw the strongest conditions i 'd ever flown in - windy and incredibly strong thermals			2
' so i had to focus really hard , for a long time , but it seemed i was just in the right head space			0
maybe i was " in the zone " as they say			0
at one point though i nearly landed at 319km into the flight - the exact distance i 'd gone the day before			2
' when i knew i 'd broken the record i was ecstatic , just a short while before i had nearly landed - my track recorder showed i was just 35 meters off the ground			2
' and suddenly i was back up at cloud base and i knew i had the record in hand and it was just an insane exclamation point to the best flight i 'd ever done			1
' there are a lot of pilots in the world right now who could have gone farther than i did , it just takes the right mind - set and a lot of hours in the saddle as we say			2
' but the most important thing is getting the right day , and then identifying when you 're up there that you 've got the day and can push hard			0
' i ca n't wait to see what people will do , and i hope i can continue to be a part of it			0
