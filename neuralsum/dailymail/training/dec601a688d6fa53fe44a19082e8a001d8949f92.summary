@entity0 was described as a ' specimen ' by one of his 400 metres rivals on tuesday and showed just why on a nippy @entity4 night 24 hours later , breaking the @entity6 record with ease			1
the 21 - year - old from @entity9 is one of the athletics world 's most impressive performers right now thanks to his fine displays in the one - lap sprint			1
@entity0 continued that incredible form this week at @entity15 , where he cruised through the heats and semi-finals before breaking @entity19 record set in 1998			1
it is no wonder @entity47 's @entity46 called him a ' specimen ' on the eve of the final in @entity4 , where 400m world - record holder @entity52 was watching on from the stands			1
so , having broken the @entity6 record , is he now eyeing the @entity56 's long - standing record of 43.18 secs ? ' not really , ' @entity0 said after the race			1
' i am going to be 22 in september			0
' @entity52 set the record when he was 32 so i have got 10 years to work with			1
i 've got a lot of things to work on			0
i 've got to build up my power			0
' you know , i just want to try and get better and just try to come here and represent my country			0
' making his country proud : @entity0 holds a @entity9 flag while doing a lap of honour at @entity15 @entity71 : day 7 review @entity0 has dipped under 44 seconds twice this year , including his @entity74 record run of 43.74 secs			1
that run in @entity76 earlier this month was the fastest 400m sprint of the year and he increasingly looks on the cusp of something special			2
' my main thing is to come out here and represent my country , ' @entity0 said			2
' i do n't really look at all of those other things			0
as long as i do that and win the title , i am happy with that			2
' fortunately for the athletics fans of @entity89 , this victory is not the last time @entity0 will grace the track in @entity4 as he still has the 4x400m relay to come			2
gone but not forgotten : @entity93 , whose record @entity0 broke , tweeted congratulating him competitors and spectators alike will be hoping for slightly better weather when that comes around , although @entity0 does not seem to give a hoot			1
' everybody has to deal with the weather so you just have to do it and try your best , ' he said			0
' it is not anybody 's fault that the weather is the way it is			0
it is just how it is			0
' we just have to run through it , not to think about it			0
it is really just an excuse for guys who do n't really believe in themselves and how they are going to perform			0
' that is certainly not something you could level at this precociously - talent @entity9 .			1

the 21 - year - old @entity9 athlete has now won every title available to him
