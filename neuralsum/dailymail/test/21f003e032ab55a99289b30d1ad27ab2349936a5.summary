' @entity11 's diary recounts how her family went into hiding from the @entity79 in the @entity98 during the @entity99			1
it became a bestseller when it was published at the end of the war			0
the book documents how @entity11 , her sister @entity12 and her family went into hiding in a canal house			2
they were eventually betrayed and sent to @entity3 , where she and her sister died			2
after the war the @entity98 government set the official date of @entity11 's death as march 31 , based on survivors accounts stating that the girls died sometime in march			1

ceremonies have been held across @entity10 and @entity178 throughout the spring marking the advance of @entity181 troops as @entity10 neared defeat			2
they are even more poignant this year because of the dwindling number of survivors and witnesses to the @entity1 , the murder of six million @entity46 by the regime of @entity188			0
