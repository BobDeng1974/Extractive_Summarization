' no replacement for real life connections ' : 93 per cent of survey respondents said they 'd rather lock eyes with someone across a room than receive a friend request from a love interest on @entity104 ' while more and more first time interactions are being formed via apps and social media , the study findings are resounding proof there is no replacement for real life connections in taking a possible love match to the next level , ' said @entity137 , head of marketing at @entity31			1
' live experiences of all shapes and sizes bring people together to celebrate their common interests and passions , ' she says			2
' being in a place with like - minded people and similar interests encourages people to be open and live in the moment			2
' it was certainly true for @entity1 couple @entity35 and @entity152 , who met at a world music event at an @entity41 bar and , after 18 months together , decided to get hitched at the city 's famous @entity40 music festival last year			2
' we hoola hooped in the gardens : ' @entity35 and @entity159 met through their shared love of music and were married 18 months later at @entity40 ' we both love @entity40			0
the food and ambience is everything we would want at our wedding			0
@entity167 suggested it as a joking idea at first , but i contacted them and within a few months we got married there ! ' says @entity35			0
she says 170 family and friends celebrated their union with them at the festival and the best part was not having to organise entertainment			0
' we did the ceremony as soon as the gates opened , before the music started			0
we then went to see several bands with a big following of guests , ate great food from the @entity40 vendors and hula hooped in the gardens			0
' with the @entity1 festival season in full swing , now could be the perfect time to get out there and find your perfect match .			0
