@entity0 will keep on playing at @entity1 even if it risks shortening his career , according to the 14 - time grand slam winner 's coach @entity3			1
@entity0 's uncle said the clay - court supremo , on a revenge mission against his one - time conqueror @entity8 on thursday , will not countenance avoiding @entity1 in a bid to lessen the damage to his long - term knee problems			1
@entity3 said on wednesday that the two - time @entity1 winner has shaken off a host of knee - joint concerns to approach this year 's tournament in rude health			1
that 's more like it : @entity0 got off to a winning start against @entity20 of @entity21 on tuesday the nine - time @entity23 king suffered a first - round exit last year and second - round slump in 2012			1
he has encountered pain when playing on grass in the past , but the world no 1 's coach said playing and winning @entity1 was a lifelong ' dream ' that @entity0 will not forego at any point in his career			1
' last year he lost in the first round , and it 's the same - we want to play here , ' said @entity3 at a @entity38 event			1
' for us it 's very important to play here , it 's a dream for us			2
' when @entity0 was young my dream was that he could win at least once here			0
every year when we come here it 's a dream , and we 'll try to keep coming			0
' if we play bad this year we 'll come back next year , so still we have a little chance to make a good tournament when we come here			0
' when he 's good , his knees and his body , then grass court is a good court for us , and he is good now			0
' we 'll always come back , the knees are not an issue in that , sometimes he has played with problems in the past , and we could do that again			0
' all smiles : @entity57 , @entity3 , @entity58 and @entity59 at @entity1 on wednesday @entity0 will face @entity60 , knowing exactly what to expect			1
the @entity62 knocked him out at the same stage in 2012 , causing a stunning upset , and @entity3 admits @entity8 poses a tough assignment for his nephew once again - but confirmed his 28 - year - old charge from @entity68 is ready for the challenge			1
' you want to play here , and it 's a special tournament , ' said @entity3			2
' people said @entity0 does n't play well here , but maybe that 's because people have a short memory			2
' we made the final in 2006 , 2007 , 2008 , 2010 , and 2011			0
' five finals and then we have problems , with the knees			0
' @entity3 joined @entity58 and @entity57 to hand out free coffee to fans queuing for @entity1 tickets			2
the coach of 14 - time grand slam winner @entity0 said humility remains central to his nephew 's success			1
' it 's unbelievable when i see some players when they think they are so high in the sky , ' said @entity3			2
' to be modest you need to be somewhere between special and stupid			0
relief : two - time champion @entity0 celebrates his first win at @entity98 in two years on tuesday ' @entity0 is not special or stupid			1
only the people who are stupid enough think they are high in the sky			0
' @entity0 is a normal man , he knows that if he were here now , he 's just like you , like me , like everybody , no problem			2
' it 's not about being modest , it 's about thinking how other people are			0
and @entity0 is good at only one thing , and this thing is playing			0
' @entity0 is closing in on @entity111 's record haul of 17 men 's grand slam titles , but @entity3 said : ' we do n't think about four more , or the record			1
' we have many fantastic victories - anything more would be amazing			0
