@entity0 is ' illegally ' tracking people ’s internet searches across the web , even if they do not have an account with the social network			1
the technology company is using so - called internet ‘ cookies ’ – little pieces of tracking data - to collect information about people ’s activity online , each time they visit a website which features a @entity0 button			1
academics in @entity17 claim that @entity19 's social network is breaching @entity21 privacy laws by placing the tracking cookies on computers without the user 's consent to log their browsing data			1
privacy : academics in @entity17 claim that @entity0 , founded by @entity19 ( pictured last week ) and with 1.3bn users , is placing tracking cookies on computers without the user 's consent @entity0 buttons are on more than 13 million ordinary websites , including those run by the government and the @entity36 , and allow users to do things such as ‘ like ’ a website , or ‘ share ’ the link on their own @entity0 page			1
a new report from the @entity43 and a @entity45 university claims that @entity0 is tracking internet users in @entity47 for two years even if they have expressly opted out			1
@entity0 has more than 1.3 billion users but there are millions more visits from people who are not signed up			1
the researchers say @entity0 is putting tracking cookies on internet users ' laptops , pcs and phones when the visit facebook.com - so they can target them with online advertising			1
this includes anyone clicking on a fan page or other pages still available without a login , or even when they visit some of the 13million pages with a @entity0 module on it and do not click on it			2
the company first plants a tracking cookie on a user ’s computer whenever they visit a website hosted on @entity0 , such as a page for a friend ’s birthday party , a fan page for a celebrity , or for a brand or shop			2
after that , any web page they visit which features a @entity0 button will relay information back to the social network			1
and the problem only becomes worse if they try to protect their privacy online , by ‘ opting out ’ of allowing web companies to track them			0
under @entity21 privacy law websites must gain consent before using a cookie , with few exceptions , and websites must ask users to accept cookies when they visit for the first time			1
privacy campaigners have today accused @entity0 of taking ‘ staggering ’ liberties by behaving in this way , and suggested that people can only really protecting themselves if they stop using the internet			2
many online companies use cookies , sent over the internet and ‘ planted ’ on people ’s computers , to gather as much information as they can about their users			0
these little pieces of data send information back to the companies ’ servers , allowing them to ‘ remember ’ the user			0
often this can help them do simple things like ‘ remembering ’ the user , so that they do n’t have to log in afresh every time they visit a particular website			0
but cookies are also used to gather information about what websites people have visited , at which times of day , so that companies can target them with carefully tailored adverts			0
this practice , known as ‘ behavioural advertising ‘ , means that users who research a particular car online , for example , would then see an advert for the same car when they visit an unrelated website			2
users can theoretically stop companies from tracking their information in this way by clicking an ‘ ad choices ’ button , featured on many websites			0
once they click that button , people are invited to pick and choose which internet companies are allowed to track them , or just ban them altogether			0
however , researchers said today that @entity0 takes the request to ‘ opt out ’ of online tracking as a cue to plant an extra cookie on people ’s computers instead			2
claims : people who visit @entity0 without signing in or one of 13million external pages with a ' like ' module are allegedly automatically tracked - even if they expressly opt - out the special cookie , called ‘ datr ’ , gives that person ’s computer or smartphone a unique tracking number , and allows @entity0 to follow its activity for the next two years			1
report author @entity170 told the @entity171 : ' @entity47 legislation is really quite clear on this point			0
to be legally valid , an individual 's consent towards online behavioural advertising must be opt - in			1
' @entity0 can not rely on users ' inaction - not opting out - to infer consent			1
as far as non-users are concerned , @entity0 really has no legal basis whatsoever to justify its current tracking practices			2
' the report 's authors said that those who make the effort to opt out of getting @entity0 cookies are given one as a result			1
co-author @entity190 said : ' if people who are not being tracked by @entity0 use the ' opt out ' mechanism proposed for the @entity21 , @entity0 places a long - term , uniquely identifying cookie , which can be used to track them for the next two years			1
' ‘ if you take measures to protect your privacy from @entity0 , you are actually going to be followed more on the internet , ’ said @entity195 , another of the authors of the report			1
privacy campaigners said today that @entity0 seemed to have forgotten that people are private citizens , rather than money - making machines			1
‘ it is both staggering and disappointing that @entity0 feels the need to track @entity210 users , people who do n’t want to interact with the social platform , ’ said @entity205 , chief executive of the lobby group @entity206			1
‘ just because internet companies can do something does n’t mean that they should do it			0
this takes it a big step further than what [ @entity219 ] @entity220 was saying , which is that if you do n’t want to be spied on , you should opt out of @entity0			2
actually , you need to opt out of the internet			0
’ mr @entity220 said last week that people should close their @entity0 accounts if they want to ensure that @entity225 security services are not spying on their information			2
@entity0 today said that the report was inaccurate and the researchers had persistently ignored their request to meet			2
a @entity0 spokesman said : ' this report contains factual inaccuracies			1
the authors have never contacted us , nor sought to clarify any assumptions upon which their report is based			0
neither did they invite our comment on the report before making it public			0
' however , we remain willing to engage with them and hope they will be prepared to update their work in due course			0
' ' earlier this year we updated our terms and policies to make them more clear and concise , to reflect new product features and to highlight how we 're expanding people 's control over advertising			0
we 're confident the updates comply with applicable laws including @entity21 law			2
' @entity0 was last month accused of acting in violation of @entity21 privacy laws by the same academics who claimed they had just expanded its old policy , not changed it , which @entity0 denied			1
the group claimed the social media site ' placed too much burden ' on users , rather than protecting themselves			0
the site uses cookies – small files which it places on your web browser or device – to collect information which can then be transmitted back to @entity0			0
the move has been condemned by privacy campaigners ‘ if a @entity0 user opts out , @entity0 promises to stop collecting or using browsing information for the purpose of showing ads. running a number of tests , we confirmed that @entity0 still tracks its users when they visit a webpage containing @entity0 social plugins , even after the user “ opts out ” , ’ the researchers concluded			1
‘ @entity0 tracks its users across websites even if they do not make use of social plug - ins , and even if they are not logged in			1
’ in january an @entity289 court said it will consider a class action against @entity0 by 25,000 people who are claiming their privacy has been breached			2
the @entity294 case is being spearheaded by law student @entity295 , who wants @entity19 's social media site to compensate him and his supporters with a symbolic £ 400 each			0
a hearing in @entity299 on april 9 will consider whether the lawsuit is admissible			0
mr @entity295 began his legal challenge last june , claiming that @entity0 supplied personal information to the @entity304 spy programme			0
over the next few months 25,000 people added their names to the lawsuit			0
the programme is the @entity225 secret service 's worldwide monitoring and data mining system and was exposed by whistleblower @entity311 last year			0
mr @entity295 is claiming damages of £ 397 ( € 500 ) per supporter , meaning that if the case was expanded and the activists won , @entity0 would have to pay out a total of £ 23.8million .			0
