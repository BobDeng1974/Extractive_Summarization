by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 03:58 est , 13 september 2012 updated : 20:36 est , 13 september 2012 @entity2 last night met @entity3 to urge him to take bigger risks to get the economy growing			1
the former defence secretary , a standard bearer of the @entity9 right , enjoyed a drink with mr @entity3 , who is coming under increasing pressure to change course to steer @entity12 out of the double dip recession			1
today dr @entity2 issued a demand for the @entity15 to deliver a ‘ totemic shock ’ to the economy , raising the prospect of massive tax and welfare cuts			1
@entity2 said the @entity15 needed to deliver a ' totemic shock ' to the economy , including axing capital gains tax for three years the former @entity9 leadership challenger also challenged @entity23 to wield the axe on paternity leave and benefits paid to pensioners , something the prime minister has repeatedly ruled out			1
‘ if we do n’t take some risks we ’ll not get growth and if we do n’t get growth we ’ll not get re-election , dr @entity2 told @entity35			0
‘ we should simply throw down the gauntlet and say that we are cutting our taxes , we are making @entity12 more competitive , we are going to reform our labour laws , make hiring and firing easier and do what we know works because it ’s worked before			0
’ speculation is growing that mr @entity3 will use his autumn statement on december 5 to unveil a business - focussed package aimed at stimulating growth			1
however , there are doubts about whether the @entity15 will be able to meet its target that by 2015 - 16 debt will be falling as a proportion of gross domestic product			1
@entity2 ( right ) and @entity3 are old friends , having worked together for many years including on the 2005 @entity9 election campaign sources have played down the idea , insisting the coalition ’s plan is ‘ working ’ giving them room to do ‘ other things ’ which will help get the economy moving			2
but dr @entity2 is clear that the @entity15 needs to be bolder			1
his key idea is scrapping capital gains tax , currently 28 per cent , for three years , and then bringing it back at a lower rate of 10 per cent			0
‘ deficit reduction alone wo n’t be enough			0
we have to have a growing economy			2
we need to shock the system			2
’ taking aim at the benefits and welfare system , dr @entity2 added : ‘ we need to have a look at everything that we have in terms of paternity leave and all the other things that are there			2
prime minister @entity23 has ruled out making cuts to many pensioner benefits ‘ with the sort of economic problems that we face in the @entity12 it is irrational and unreasonable to expect that those in work should keep all their social benefits and workplace benefits should be protected , at the cost of making the next generation unemployed			1
' that is not a sustainable generational compact			0
' he also urged ministers to bring forward the decision no new airport capacity in the @entity95			0
allies of mr @entity3 insisted the chancellor was relaxed about dr @entity2 ’s comments			0
before the election mr @entity23 was clear that benefits for wealthy pensioners would be protected			1
‘ let me say very clearly to pensioners if you have a @entity103 , your bus pass , your @entity105 , your free tv licence all these things are safe			0
' you can read my lips , that is a promise from my heart			0
’ he has repeated the pledge several times since becoming prime minister .			0

former defence secretary demands the @entity15 deliver a ' totemic shock ' to the economy
nothing should be off *limits* - even the benefits for pensioners which the @entity115 says are protected
