by @entity0 published : 10:10 est , 23 april 2012 updated : 10:20 est , 23 april 2012 big spender : @entity3 president @entity2 , pictured today , who is presiding over huge budget rises while @entity5 and other countries cut back their own @entity5 taxpayers face paying millions of pounds more for ‘ pointless ’ @entity9 quangos after @entity10 planned a massive budget increase of 33 per cent over two years			1
overall , the cost of 52 agencies and committees – such as the @entity15 – is set to rise to £ 2.17billion if the @entity17 plan is approved			1
and because @entity5 pays 13 per cent of the budget , taxpayers in this country would therefore be hit with a bill of £ 298million this year			1
the news came as @entity5 treasury chief secretary @entity23 announced that government departments at home will have to find even more cuts			0
@entity27 , a research analyst for the @entity29 think - tank , said : ' while some of these @entity9 quangos perform valuable work , many others serve no practical purpose whatsoever apart from soaking up taxpayers ’ money			1
' ironically , many of these bodies would never have survived the type of austerity programmes that the @entity9 is now drawing up for member states as @entity42 fights through its worst crisis in a generation			0
' the think - tank has identified at least ten agencies that serve no unique purpose and ought to be abolished			0
it claims that many others are duplicating work and suggests that the remaining 42 agencies have their budgets cut by 30 per cent			0
this would save @entity9 member states just over £ 566million every year , with @entity5 keeping an extra £ 82million to spend on more worthwhile causes			1
the number of quangos has rapidly grown from just three in 1990 to 52 today			1
the number doubled in just seven years alone from 2004 to last year			0
boom : the graph shows the rise of @entity9 quangos from there being just three in 1990 to 52 today soaring cost : the rising cost , measures in million euros , of quangos since 2005 the total cost to @entity42 taxpayers now stands is set to rise 3.4 per cent from last year and a massive 33.2 per cent compared with 2010 , if the @entity17 ’s budget is approved			1
over 90 per cent of the cost comes from the 27 @entity9 member states – with @entity75 ’s contribution of £ 400million the highest , followed by @entity76 ( £ 315million ) and @entity5			1
the rest of the budget is made up from @entity80 member states such as @entity81			0
@entity82 pointed out that there are currently two @entity9 agencies specifically dedicated to human rights in addition to similar bodies in member states , the @entity89 , the @entity90 , a specific @entity9 commissioner for ' fundamental rights ' and a range of @entity94			2
the think - tank also claims in its report that there is no evidence that the £ 105million - a - year @entity99 , an “ advisory ” body that has existed since the 1950s , has actually altered the outcome of an @entity9 proposal in recent years , and yet it remains in place			2
as an evaluation for the @entity17 concluded , the system of @entity9 agencies also “ creates an indirect but powerful incentive for spending ” taxpayers ’ cash			2
for example , the @entity111 ( @entity111 ) paid a consultancy firm £ 200,000 in order to assess its own media coverage			0
the @entity116 also spent £ 250,000 on a ‘ living map ’ of @entity42 , created from 5,000 plants affixed to the outside wall of its headquarters in @entity122 in order to promote biodiversity			0
the facade stayed up for around five months in 2010			0
on its website , the @entity116 said it wanted to ' illustrate the significance of vertical gardens '			0
bureaucratic behemoth : the @entity17 building in @entity10 , which cost taxpayers £ 1.1billion each board meeting of the @entity133 ( @entity133 ) – whose mandate already overlaps with that of another @entity9 agency , and whose board only consists of 15 people – costs € 92,630 on average , working out at € 6,175 per member			1
in another study , the @entity141 pointed to the @entity15 , which is given a £ 10million - a - year grant , as one of the most pointless a report explained that : ‘ this agency effectively licenses and manages intellectual property rights to new types of plants and crops across the @entity9			2
‘ protecting ip is important , but there ’s no good reason why this role could not be performed by national ip agencies ( like the the @entity5 ’s @entity156 ) , which could even compete with each other to bring down costs – currently between € 1,200 and € 2,400 per examination fee per plant			2

cost of running @entity9 quangos now costs taxpayers £ 2.17billion a year
number of agencies has risen from just three in 1990 to 52 today
axeing just ten most ' pointless ' quangos would save @entity5 £ 100m
