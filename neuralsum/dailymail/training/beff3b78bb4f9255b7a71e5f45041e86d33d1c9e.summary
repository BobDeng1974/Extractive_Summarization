by @entity0 published : 05:37 est , 28 april 2013 updated : 05:06 est , 29 april 2013 an academic who claims to have fathered 49 children as a sperm donor has been arrested on suspicion of sexually assaulting women he promised to help become pregnant			1
professor @entity6 was accused by two women in their twenties , one of whom is believed to be pregnant with his child			1
detectives have since identified a third alleged victim			0
@entity14 the neuroscientist , an expert on maternal and foetal medicine , is believed to have advertised as a sperm donor online			1
@entity6 , 50 , who leads a research group for @entity20 , @entity21 , is also thought to have three children with a partner in @entity24			1
interviewed in january under a pseudonym , he told a newspaper that he had fathered 49 children by private sperm donations			1
to reduce the risk of biologically - related offspring meeting and reproducing , donors can only provide sperm to ten families under @entity35 law			1
but it is not known whether all the children @entity6 claims to have fathered were conceived in this country			1
@entity6 , using a pseudonym , reportedly said : ‘ i think this is just based on moral horror , not that there is much risk offspring will accidentally meet and set up homes with half - siblings			2
the risks of this are very low			0
in @entity49 there is no restraint on the number of children a donor can father and in the @entity55 it ’s 25 per donor			1
‘ the recipients i ’ve helped are aware of the number of women i ’ve helped			2
’ sperm donors in @entity35 can provide for a maximum of ten families , according to regulator the @entity64			2
donors need permission from the @entity64 to exceed the limit , but there is no cap on the number of children who can be born to a family using the sperm			1
many women go to clinics where each donation can cost thousands of pounds and it may take more than one attempt to get pregnant			1
there are no reliable figures on how many turn to private donors instead			2
not all clinics let those seeking donors select sperm on the basis of looks , personality and academic ability			2
this is another reason why recipients may choose a private @entity92 2005 , sperm donors lost the right to remain anonymous			1
some fear this deters them or encourages them to only agree to private donations , rather than through official channels			2
@entity6 met women in @entity21 and @entity99 through unlicensed donor websites , going by the name of @entity102 and advertising his services as an artificial insemination donor			1
in his online profile he writes : ‘ i am mid- 40s ... @entity106 ( @entity107 ) and married with 3 children of my own , based in @entity21 , @entity35			0
‘ @entity109 i have black hair and green eyes , but am heterozygote for child blonde hair and blue eyes – approx half the children look that way			0
i do think children are fun , and enrich life , and so would be happy to donate to a lesbian couple , hetero couple or someone single			0
‘ i am 165cm/70kg , with black hair and green / brown eyes			0
’ @entity6 , who grew up in @entity124 and came to @entity21 in 2001 , said he offered his services both as a donor and as a doctor as he wanted to give the gift of parenthood			0
he added : ‘ i am most proud of the donation i made to a woman who had spent £ 5,000 through an official clinic			0
‘ it failed so she came to me and i helped her get pregnant for free			1
’ @entity6 , who has been bailed by police , told the paper that being a donor was ‘ like a hobby or a charitable act ’ and he ‘ got satisfaction by helping ’			2
he added : ‘ the first couple i helped were lesbians who were desperate for a baby and i helped them get pregnant on their first cycle			0
‘ they were delighted and i shared their joy			0
‘ they come to these sites because they ca n’t afford the substantial cost of getting a donor through a clinic			0
‘ i never ask for money , only travel expenses			0
