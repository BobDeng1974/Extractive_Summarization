the @entity1 - controlled @entity0 on thursday approved a bipartisan bill to construct the @entity4 oil pipeline , defying a presidential veto threat and setting up the first of many battles with the @entity8 over energy and the environment			1
the 62 - 36 vote advanced a top priority of the newly empowered @entity13 , and marked the first time the @entity0 passed a bill authorizing the pipeline , despite numerous attempts to force president @entity19 's hand on the issue			1
nine @entity21 joined with 53 republicans to back the measure , which would take the decision on whether to build the pipeline out of the @entity26			1
still the vote was short of the threshold needed to override a veto , and the legislation still must be reconciled with the version the @entity8 passed			1
' i 'd like to congratulate leader @entity68 for passing this bill in an open , inclusive and bipartisan way , ' house speaker @entity66 said after the vote			2
' after dropping his scheme to tax middle - class college savings , we hope president @entity19 will now drop his threat to veto this common - sense bill that would strengthen our energy security and create thousands and thousands of new , good - paying @entity80 jobs			1
' @entity19 's @entity81 has put at 42,000 the number of jobs the @entity4 project would create in the @entity80 , and declared that the environmental impact would be negligible			1
@entity66 's jab about college savings referred to a @entity8 plan to @entity90 college savings plans in order to pay for a universal guarantee of free community college tuition			2
the @entity19 administration abandoned the idea this week			0
@entity4 , if it 's built according to plan , would carry more than 1 million barrles of oil each day to refineries in the southen @entity80 , mostly from @entity50			2
this bill ' is an important accomplishment for the country , ' said majority leader @entity36 of @entity104			0
steam injection pipes , left , separate a heavy oil called bitumen from the earth and pipe it ( center ) into tanks ; if the pipeline is built the oil will head south into the @entity80 for refining the @entity19 administration has focused its condemnation of the project on the contention that @entity50 , whose tar sands oilfields would mark the pipeline 's starting point , would be the only beneficiary			1
but oil from several northern @entity80 states would also flow through @entity4			0
@entity19 spoke in @entity127 , @entity128 in march 2012 , acknowledging that @entity80 is producing ' so much oil and gas in places like @entity132 and @entity133 that we do n’t have enough pipeline capacity to transport all of it			2
' sen. @entity137 of @entity132 , who shepherded the @entity4 legislation through the @entity0 , complained that @entity19 had ' delayed this important infrastructure project for more than six years			1
' ' the will of the @entity80 people and @entity142 is clear			0
i encourage the president to sign this legislation and work with us , ' he said			0
his fellow @entity132 senator , democrat @entity148 , was one of the nine who crossed from left to right to pass the bill			0
' supporting projects , like the @entity4 pipeline that are in the best interest of our energy , economic , and national security , ' she said in a statement			0
' it ’s imperative that we pass the @entity4 pipeline , and move on so we finally talk about what the larger energy strategy for our country			0
' this map shows the proposed route of @entity167 's @entity4 pipeline @entity168 , @entity169 , that @entity4 's got to go : protesters have gathered to shout slogans wherever @entity19 has spoken in recent months @entity13 : sen. @entity174 of @entity175 ( center ) was accompanied by sen. @entity137 of @entity132 ( left ) and majority leader @entity36 of @entity104 ( right ) after the vote			1
@entity137 sponsored the @entity4 bill most republicans – and some @entity21 – see @entity4 as a jobs and infrastructure bill of the type @entity19 often urges them to back			1
' the president has called on @entity142 to pass bipartisan infrastructure projects , and soon he will have the opportunity to sign one into law , ' said @entity189 @entity188 sen. @entity188			1
@entity21 view the @entity50 - to - @entity189 pipeline project as a potential environmental despoiler and a needless sop to fossil fuel producers @entity21 framed the bill as gift to a foreign oil company that would have little benefit for the @entity80 people , because much of the oil would be exported			1
they tried and failed to get amendments on the bill to construct the pipeline with @entity80 steel , ban exports of the oil and the products refined from it , and protect water resources			0
the @entity0 agreed to add an energy efficiency measure , and went on the record saying climate change was not a hoax and the oil sands should be subject to a tax that helps pay for oil spill cleanups			0
oil sands are currently exempt			0
complaining on the margins : @entity21 ( l to @entity218 ) @entity219 of @entity220 , @entity221 of @entity222 and @entity223 of @entity224 obected to the failure of their amendments which would have put conditions on the pipeline 's construction ' this bill is a disgrace , ' said sen. @entity232 , the top @entity233 on the @entity0 environment committee			1
' we tried on our side to make this a better bill and they turned us away			0
' first proposed in 2008 , the $ 8 billion pipeline project has been beset by delays in @entity242 over its route and at the @entity8 , where the president has resisted prior efforts by @entity142 to force him to make a decision			1
in 2012 , @entity19 rejected the project after @entity142 attached a measure to a payroll tax cut extension that gave him a deadline to make a decision			1
the pipeline 's developer , @entity167 , then reapplied			0
@entity19 has said he will not be forced to make a decision on the pipeline , which requires presidential approval because it crosses an international border , until the review process concludes			2
federal agencies ' comments on whether the project is in the national interest are due monday			0
' the president is out of excuses , ' @entity264 sen. @entity263 said thursday			0
environmental groups have called on @entity19 to reject the project outright , saying it would make it easier to tap a dirty source of energy that would exacerbate global warming			2
@entity272 , a moneyed green group , called @entity137 's bill ' doomed			0
' the @entity81 's analysis , assuming higher oil prices , found that shipping oil by rail or tankers would be worse for the planet .			2

vote was 62 - 36 with nine @entity21 joining 53 republicans
@entity8 *reiterated* thursday that president @entity19 will veto the bill , setting up a *showdown* as the @entity13 *searches* for 67 votes to overturn him
@entity1 see the measure as a jobs and infrastructure bill of the type @entity19 often urges them to back
@entity21 view the @entity50 - to - @entity189 pipeline project as a potential environmental despoiler and a needless sop to fossil fuel producers
@entity19 's @entity81 , however , found that it poses no *meaningful* threat to the environment
