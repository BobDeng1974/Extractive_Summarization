by @entity0 published : 12:27 est , 12 january 2014 updated : 20:19 est , 13 january 2014 @entity3 manager @entity2 has been told to improve his touchline behaviour after his foul - mouthed insult aimed at @entity7 boss @entity6			1
@entity2 escaped disciplinary action , but an @entity10 spokesman said : ‘ we have been in contact with @entity2 and reminded him of his responsibilities			1
’ @entity2 , 52 , was caught on camera calling @entity6 a ‘ f * * * * * * old c * * * ’ during @entity7 ’s 2 - 0 win at @entity19 on sunday			1
@entity40 will be back in the @entity42 this weekend , though not taking charge of a game - he is fourth official for @entity46 ’s trip to @entity47			2
former @entity49 official @entity48 , now a refereeing coach , last night described @entity40 ’s decision as ‘ an error of judgment ’ and added : ‘ we can all see that the player is not in front of the goalkeeper and the goal should have stood but , from where @entity40 was stood , he thought he was ( impeding )			2
’ angry : @entity2 ( left ) showed his frustration to the officials as they walked off the pitch at half - time point to make : @entity2 ( left ) believes the decision to disallow @entity26 's goal was wrong although the @entity10 are still awaiting @entity40 ’s official report of the game , which will include the observations of fourth official @entity70 , they took the unusual step yesterday of issuing a statement that @entity2 would not face any punishment over his behaviour			1
@entity2 , who has been fined previously for incidents at @entity19 , has been sent a letter by the @entity10 and warned about his conduct			1
the outburst at @entity79 was clearly caught live on camera in the televised clash			0
controversy : @entity27 ( centre ) was judged to be offside despite not touching the ball after @entity26 's shot @entity2 , who was mortified that the incident had been picked up , said he had spoken to the @entity7 boss afterwards , and also offered apologies in his press conference			1
@entity2 said : ‘ it was a heat of the moment thing , words we always have as managers , to a degree			2
i ’ve apologised and i ’m fortunate that he ’s accepted that			0
‘ i have apologised for that particular word			0
we always tease each other and have words			0
what he said to me is going to remain private , but it did n’t merit my response			0
’ @entity2 , who returns to former club @entity104 with @entity3 this weekend , was also careful with his criticism of @entity40 ’s decision to disallow @entity26 ’s goal and will be hopeful those comments have not landed him in further hot water			1
tough luck ? @entity112 players celebrate @entity26 's goal before it was disallowed by the referee overruled : @entity114 ( centre ) disputes the linesman 's decision to disallow @entity3 's first half goal big call : @entity26 ( right ) claims that he does n't understand why his goal was chalked off @entity6 clearly could not understand all the fuss about the disallowed goal			1
‘ it was a valid decision , ’ said the @entity7 boss directly after the game			2
‘ the player was clearly offside			0
’ @entity7 ’s former @entity3 midfielder @entity127 said @entity128 had been impeded by the presence of @entity27 , who shifted out of the way of @entity26 ’s shot			1
@entity127 said : ‘ @entity132 says that although he was n’t blocking his view of the ball he was standing where he was going to dive , so he could n’t really make a dive			0
all over : @entity137 scored @entity7 's second goal during their 2 - 0 win against @entity3 ‘ if someone is in your way you are not going to dive on them			1
maybe he was n’t interfering but it is such a hard one to get right			0
i can see the point for both sides			0
’ @entity7 were also unhappy with referee @entity40 for failing to send off @entity3 defender @entity150 for a late and wild tackle on @entity151 , who left @entity19 ’ with his left knee in a brace			1
@entity6 added : ‘ his injury is very serious			2
it was a very unfair kick			0
it was a red card			0
i do n’t understand why he was not sent off			0

@entity2 apologises after foul - mouthed blast following disallowed goal
@entity7 went on to beat @entity3 2 - 0 at @entity19
@entity10 confirm they have ' reminded @entity2 of responsibilities '
@entity6 claims referee @entity40 was right to chalk off *effort*
