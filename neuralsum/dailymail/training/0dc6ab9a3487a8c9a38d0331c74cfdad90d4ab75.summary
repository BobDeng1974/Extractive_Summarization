by @entity0 so far the world of technology has been treated to smartwatches , augmented reality glasses and electronic t - shirts			0
but one area of wearable technology that no one 's yet put a finger on is the humble fingernail itself			0
thankfully that 's all set to change , however , as @entity14 toy company @entity13 has released led stickers for nails that light up when you take a phone call			1
the @entity26 - only technology is currently available just in @entity27 , but other countries fret not - the company has plans for a worldwide release if they prove popular the ' @entity21 ' uses a technology called @entity22 ( @entity22 ) , in which small amounts of power are transferred very short distances , to communicate with a smartphone			1
@entity38 - base @entity37 claims its wearable technology ( right ) does n't compromise on fashion			0
it has designed outfits that can change colour , light up or shimmer using an @entity44 app. led lights are integrated using nylon ribbon removing the need for wires			2
the batteries are disguised as buttons or clasps meaning that the designs can be created with traditional fabrics			0
this means that when the ' smart nails ' come near an @entity22 device , such as a phone , they will light up			1
it also flashes whenever the wearer uses an electronic money card such as a train pass			0
the product is on sale in @entity27 , with a set of 16 nail stickers - one of which contains the led - costing 1,200 yen ( £ 7 ; $ 12 )			1
the micro-thin led sticker apparently builds on the popularity of manicure art - where intricate patterns and small gem - like stones are stuck on the nail			0
@entity78 users are sure to be disappointed , however , as the @entity79 are currently only available for a variety of @entity26 devices			1
the product is marketed mainly at young people , said company spokeswoman @entity84			1
' i am now wearing it on the middle finger of my right hand , ' she said in a press release			0
' it blinks whenever i pass through train gates , which lifts my heart a bit			2
' while the product is only on sale in @entity27 for now , fingernail tech - enthusiasts in other countries such as the @entity97 and @entity98 need not worry			2
the company will consider marketing the cosmetic product overseas after seeing how consumers in @entity27 react			2
the product ( pictured ) is on sale in @entity27 , with a set of 16 nail stickers - one of which contains the led - costing 1,200 yen ( £ 7 ; $ 12 )			1
