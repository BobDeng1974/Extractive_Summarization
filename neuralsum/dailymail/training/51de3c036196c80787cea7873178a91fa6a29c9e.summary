@entity40 , from the search and rescue charity , said : ' we can only think the seal lost its bearings in stormy weather and then began swimming in the wrong direction			1
' the seal was very thin when we found it , and i ca nâ€™t think that it would have survived for much longer			2
' it was really quite difficult to catch , the seals are slippery things			0
we then took it to the station , where we weighed it and ensured it was healthy			0
