by @entity0 published : 13:05 est , 16 september 2013 updated : 13:30 est , 16 september 2013 @entity2 police have arrested three @entity3 competing in a @entity4 to @entity6 rally after they drove through the country in a car disguised as a tank			1
the trio of friends , who were raising money for @entity13 , were put in police cells because of the mock @entity15			1
the 26 - year - olds spent £ 500 on a r - registered @entity17 , disguised it with camouflage paint , used plywood for the turrett and an old drainpipe for the gun before hitting the road to compete in the 2013 @entity25 from @entity26 in @entity4 to @entity6			1
having a laugh : the trio of friends , who were raising money for @entity13 , were put in police cells for driving the mock @entity15 however , their dreams of winning first prize were dashed when their phoney military motor was stopped by @entity2 motorway police who impounded it and locked them up for almost two hours while taking the ' tank ' off for a road safety inspection of their own - which it failed			1
@entity42 , of @entity43 , @entity44 , who works as a graphic designer , said : ' @entity2 mots are much stricter than ours			2
' they said the brakes were dodgy and it had too much rust but it had got through its @entity52 in the @entity3 and was properly insured			0
' we think they just did n't like a @entity3 car driving through their country looking like a tank - they were gunning for us			0
' police told them it would cost 4,000 euros to get the car roadworthy			0
fundraising : the 26 - year - olds spent £ 500 on the r - registered @entity17 , disguised it with camouflage paint mr @entity42 said : ' it had been a smooth ride until we got to @entity2			1
we 'd had no problems at the ferry port or through passport control in @entity4			2
' the tank had n't offended anyone			0
we do n't think it was insensitive at all - in fact we won a £ 50 prize for " best - dressed banger " which we 'll be giving to @entity13			1
' mr @entity42 , who was with his pals @entity78 and @entity80 , who are all former pupils of @entity82 , said : ' we knew as soon as we saw the police car pull out of a sliproad and start following us we were in trouble , it was that inevitable feeling of doom			0
' they were very rude , whistling at us to get out the car then said they might crush it			0
it was pretty clear they did n't like it			0
' a spokesman for @entity97 police in @entity98 said the vehicle was spotted by officers on the @entity102 road because it was ' a bizarre conversion '			0
the fundraisers ' dreams of winning first prize were dashed when their phoney military motor was stopped by @entity2 motorway police he said : ' when checking the car , officials found serious flaws in the brake system and rusted wishbone			1
the rally was therefore terminated prematurely for the young men			0
' with their hopes of claiming first prize dashed and no chance of forking out enough euros to get the car back on the road , the men were released and walked away from the police station to make their own way home			2
mr @entity42 said : ' we were just left with no car , no hotel , no taxi number to make our own arrangements			0
' luckily we managed to get flights home the next day but it meant we lost money on the hotel in @entity6 and flights back from there that we 'd already paid for			2
' we 're about £ 3,000 out of pocket and feeling pretty bitter about it - although in time we 'll probably laugh about it			1
' as for next year , mr @entity42 said : ' the rally organisers have given us a free pass to enter next year			1
' if we do , we wo n't be going through @entity2 again - there 's nothing much to see anyway			2
