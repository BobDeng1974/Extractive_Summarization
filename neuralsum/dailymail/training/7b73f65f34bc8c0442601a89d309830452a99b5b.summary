by @entity0 published : 18:02 est , 20 september 2012 updated : 02:28 est , 21 september 2012 sloppy nhs care after operations is costing the lives of thousands of patients , research shows			2
nearly four in 100 people having common forms of surgery die as a result – twice as many as once thought			1
the study also found the death rate is higher in @entity12 than in many @entity14 countries , including @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17			1
@entity1 troubles : researchers said patients were dying from blood poisoning , kidney failure , heart attacks and strokes that medics had not picked up in time ( file picture ) the researchers said patients were dying from blood poisoning , kidney failure , heart attacks and strokes that medics had not picked up in time			1
a shortage of intensive care beds was also cited as a factor ; there are fewer in @entity1 hospitals than in many other countries			0
@entity38 , one of the @entity42 - @entity41 study ’s authors , who is based at the @entity43 in @entity44 , said : ‘ nurses are coming into the room in the morning and finding somebody dead in their bed			0
‘ many of the patients get sepsis , or blood poisoning , overnight and often it is not detected			1
the bad news is that mortality is higher than we thought but hopefully there is room for improvement			0
’ @entity58 from @entity59 , who led the research , said : ‘ it ’s certainly very worrying and i believe some of these deaths are preventable			0
‘ we need to get the overall mortality down to one in 100 deaths per patients			1
’ the researchers , whose study is in the @entity69 , looked at data on more than 46,500 patients in 28 @entity14 countries			1
all had undergone surgery that required them to stay in hospital at least one night			0
concerns : the researchers looked at data on more than 46,500 patients in 28 @entity14 countries ( file ) these included a vast range of procedures from hip replacements to hernia removal to operations to take out bowel cancer tumours			1
the researchers did not include those who had undergone heart or brain surgery or women needing emergency operations during pregnancy			1
they found that 3.6 per cent of @entity12 patients had died within 60 days of having the operation			1
this figure is higher than in @entity15 , @entity96 , @entity16 , @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 – but the researchers said they needed to investigate further before they can conclude that @entity1 care is worse			1
the research , which was partly funded by the @entity102 , found that just 6 per cent of patients were admitted to intensive care			0
this was lower than many other countries and a lack of available beds may partly explain the high death rates , according to the academics			2
in 2010 , @entity112 researchers found there are 3.5 beds per 100,000 of the @entity12 population compared with 24.6 in @entity41 , 20 in the @entity116 and 9.6 in @entity117			2
professor @entity118 said that in order to bring down the death rates , the most at - risk patients needed to be monitored properly			2
these include the elderly , those with diabetes , heart problems or kidney disease for example who are more likely to suffer complications			2
he added : ‘ simply calling for more intensive care unit beds will not solve the problem			0
' it ’s certainly very worrying and i believe some of these deaths are preventable			0
we need to get the overall mortality down to one in 100 deaths per patients ' @entity58 , research leader from @entity59 ‘ new , cost - effective ways of identifying and monitoring patients at risk must be developed			2
’ the researchers said that it was n’t the surgery that was poor , but rather the after care			0
medical staff were not doing enough to monitor patients so any sudden deterioration in their health was often going undetected			0
they should carry out regular checks of their blood pressure , heart rate , breathing and temperature up to five times a day			1
but many hospitals do not have enough adequately trained doctors or nurses to carry out the checks and who also know what to do when patients suddenly deteriorate			0
professor @entity163 , the @entity1 medical director , said : ‘ the @entity1 is already among the best in @entity14 for some surgery specialties but these reports are vital as they show surgeons where they need to improve			0

death rate higher in @entity12 than countries such as @entity15 and @entity16
nearly four in 100 people having common forms of surgery die as a result
patients are dying from blood poisoning , kidney failure and heart attacks
