by @entity0 published : 14:20 est , 2 january 2014 updated : 03:21 est , 3 january 2014 a naturally occurring hormone can be used to stop the ‘ high ’ produced by cannabis , research has shown			1
the discovery could lead to new approaches to treating cannabis intoxication and dependence			1
it may also assist in the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes while blocking its psychoactive effects			1
a naturally occurring hormone called pregnenolone can be used to stop the ' high ' produced by cannabis and the discovery could lead to new approaches to treating cannabis intoxication and dependence , according to new research @entity19 is a hormone that is found in our bodies and can be made in the lab. the chemical is used for fatigue and increasing energy , alzheimer ’s disease and enhancing memory , trauma and injuries , as well as stress and improving immunity			1
it is also is used for skin disorders including psoriasis			0
in the body , pregnenolone is used to make all steroid hormones			0
because of this , it was studied studied for stress , fatigue , and arthritis in the 1940s before lab - made hormones became available			0
source : @entity47 researchers found that the steroid hormone pregnenolone reduces the brain 's sensitivity to @entity52 , which is the chief high - inducing compound in cannabis			1
scientists led by dr @entity56 , from the @entity57 in @entity58 , studied mice and rats to see how recreational drugs such as cocaine , alcohol and cannabis affected the production of steroids in the brain involved in nerve function			1
they found that @entity52 triggered a dramatic spike in pregnenolone through activation of the cannabinoid receptor ( cb - 1 ) - a molecule that facilitates cannabis stimulation			1
this in turn had a ‘ negative feedback ’ effect leading to a blunting of @entity52 activity , reducing the ‘ high ’ from the drug			1
‘ this new understanding of the role of pregnenolone has the potential to generate new therapies for the treatment of cannabis dependence , ’ the scientists said			1
the findings , published in the journal @entity91 , follow the decision to legalise the recreational use of cannabis in the @entity96 state of @entity97			0
yesterday saw the legalisation of recreational sales of marijuana in @entity97 , where customers queued to buy an ounce ( 28.3g ) of legal cannabis			0
researchers found that the steroid hormone pregnenolone reduces the brain 's sensitivity to @entity52 , which is the chief high - inducing compound in cannabis possession , cultivation and private consumption of marijuana has been legal in the state since november 2012 but the sale of the drug from shops marks a turning point			1
@entity97 has set up a plant - tracking system in a bid to prevent the drug from entering the black market , and regulators have set up packaging , labelling and testing requirements			2
in december , @entity126 became the first country to to make it legal to grow , sell and consume marijuana			0
the law allowing registered @entity126 over 18 to buy up to 40g ( 1,4oz ) of the drug a month is expected to come into force in april and the government hopes it will weaken tackle drug cartels			0
a recent study found teenagers who use cannabis regularly risk damaging their memory as structures in their brains appeared to shrink and collapse inward , possibly reflecting a decrease in neurons however , while some people believe the legalisation of the drug will cut criminal activity surrounding it , others believe it will expose more people to drugs , which have been linked to health issues			2
a recent study found teenagers who use cannabis regularly risk damaging their memory , which can lead to poor academic performance			2
they believe the brain abnormalities last for ‘ at least a few years ’ after users have stopped taking the drug			2
the researchers also said there was fresh evidence the habit may cause mental health problems in youngsters predisposed to schizophrenia			0
marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug among adolescents in the @entity168 , with more than four in ten admitting having taken it			0
almost 100 teenagers took part in the @entity96 research examining the effects of cannabis deep in the brain			2
it found teenagers who smoked it daily for about three years had abnormal changes in the brain structures related to remembering and processing information and they performed poorly on memory tasks			0
the brain abnormalities and memory problems were found on mri scans when study participants were in their early twenties – two years after they had stopped smoking the drug			2
memory - related structures in their brains appeared to shrink and collapse inward and the researchers from @entity191 , @entity192 , said such damage was linked to poor academic performance and everyday functioning .			0

@entity57 researchers found the hormone pregnenolone cuts the brain 's sensitivity to @entity52 - the high - inducing compound in cannabis
@entity204 could lead to new approaches to treating cannabis dependence
people taking the drug medicinally could skip its psychoactive effects
