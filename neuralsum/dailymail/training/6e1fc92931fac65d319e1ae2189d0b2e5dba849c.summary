a fascinating 18th century ‘ prenup ’ between @entity2 and his first wife @entity3 is set to be auctioned in @entity0			1
it suggests that the legendary couple , who married in 1796 , were just as concerned about protecting their personal wealth as any rich man and wife living today			2
the contract will be auctioned in the @entity12 capital on september 21th , and is expected to go for up to £ 80,000			1
i aint sayin ' she a golddigger : a ‘ prenup ’ between @entity2 and his first wife @entity3 is set to fetch £ 80,000 at auction not only did both @entity3 and @entity2 lie about their age in the documents , but they failed to disclose assets in case they had to divide them following a separation			1
the contract states that the pair will ‘ in no way be responsible for the debts and mortgages of the other ’ and that there will be ‘ no common property ’			0
@entity3 was six years older than her lover – something that was likely to provoke a scandal at the time , because she would have been expected to produce an heir			2
@entity3 was also a widow well known for her passionate affairs with a number of men when she became @entity2 ’s mistress in 1795			1
older women : @entity2 was 26 when he married @entity3 - a 33 - year - old widow he was 26 at the time , and already a brilliantly successful military commander who would go on to become emperor of @entity12			1

a law of 1795 allowed @entity3 to reclaim her dead husband ’s assets , and she was determined to hang on with them , along with her two children			0
@entity2 's mother and sisters were particularly resentful of his marriage to @entity3 , because she made them feel unsophisticated			2
it was for these reasons that an old fashioned version of the prenuptial agreement was signed by both on march 8 , 1796 , the day before their wedding			1
although nothing like as complicated as it would be today ‘ it is a contract which is full of anecdotes , ’ said @entity64 , of auctioneers @entity66			0
‘ it may look simple - you have all the normal artefacts you 'd find in a marriage contract , but when you study it closely it gives us lots of information about how things might be divided			0
’ as it turned out , the marriage lasted less than a decade and was annulled by the @entity82 when @entity3 failed to give @entity2 children			2
the relationship was often used by the @entity85 to mock @entity2 , along with his relatively small height			0
‘ @entity90 ’ was meant to have regularly said ‘ not tonight , @entity3 ’ because he could not keep up with @entity3 's sexual demands , but this is in fact a myth .			0
