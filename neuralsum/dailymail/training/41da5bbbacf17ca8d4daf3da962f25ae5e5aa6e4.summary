@entity0 , @entity1 mp , said motorists who want to drive could be forced to join ' car clubs ' in an article examining @entity6 's infrastructure problems owning a car could be ‘ outlawed ’ to force people on to public transport , a senior @entity1 mp has suggested			1
motorists who want to drive could instead be forced to join communal ‘ car clubs ’ where the cars are shared by drivers and used only when needed			2

in an article in the @entity25 , dr @entity0 wrote : ‘ we need to consider doing something serious			2
what we need is a considerable expansion of public transport over the next period and a shift from car to bus , train , bike or even feet			0

dr @entity0 added : ‘ what if the government simply regulated for cars to be sold and used just as they are at present ( hopefully with an increasing presence of electric and hybrid vehicles ) but outlawed individual ownership ? he warned the rise in car ownership would lead to ‘ something approaching a national traffic jam before 2040 ’ ‘ people would then lease cars individually or as part of a club and the running costs would be included in the lease arrangements			1
no one would be prohibited from using a car , but the playing field of choice would instantly be levelled			0
’ but his suggestions were last night described as ‘ bonkers ’ by transport minister @entity64 , who said @entity1 had waged a ‘ 13 - year war ’ against motorists .			1
