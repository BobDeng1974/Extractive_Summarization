the secret of happiness may be to not expect too much from life			0
for if you start off with low expectations you could end up pleasantly surprised , according to a scientific study into human happiness			1
a stock image of a group of smiling friends is pictured the ‘ ebb and flow ’ of mental happiness - the way our mood shifts moment - to - moment - is profoundly impacted by our expectations of life , they suggest			1
the researchers even created a formula for predicting happiness			0
although the formula itself is complicated , put simply it looks at the event ( t ) , how important or significant that event is to that person ( w ) and when the event occurred , also known as the ' forgetting factor '			0
the ' forgetting factor ' in particular looks at what has happened in the past to determine the current expectations			0
@entity42 is the average reward from taking part in a certain event , and @entity46 is the reward compared to the expectation the person had beforehand			0
the researchers created a formula ( pictured ) for happiness			0
although the formula is complicated , put simply it looks at the event ( t ) , how important or significant the event is ( w ) and when the event occurred ( y )			0
@entity42 is the reward for taking part , and @entity46 is the reward compared to the expectation dr @entity63 of @entity64 said his team were surprised to find just how important expectation is			1
he said : ‘ it is often said that you will be happier if your expectations are lower			0
‘ we find that there is some truth to this - lower expectations make it more likely that an outcome will exceed those expectations and have a positive impact on happiness			1
’ but his team of researchers , who tested their theory on 18,000 people , also discovered a converse force affects our mood			2
while low expectations can make us happy if they are exceeded later , having high expectations to begin with make us happy earlier			1
scientists found that day - to - day wellbeing does not reflects whether things are going better than expected			1
they also discovered that expectations affect happiness before an outcome is certain			2
for instance , going to a friend 's favourite restaurant ( illustrated ) with positive expectations can instantly lift someone 's mood dr @entity63 said : ‘ expectations also affect happiness even before we learn the outcome of a decision			1
‘ if you have plans to meet a friend at your favourite restaurant , those positive expectations may increase your happiness as soon as you make the plan			1
’ @entity8 scientists found that day - to - day wellbeing does not reflect how well things are going , but whether things are going better than expected			1
lower expectations make it more likely that an outcome will exceed those expectations and have a positive impact on happiness			1
while low expectations can make us happy if they are exceeded later , having high expectations to begin with make us happy earlier , the found			1
expectations also affect happiness even before we learn the outcome of a decision			2
his team combined the contrasting aspects of expectation and its impact on happiness and wrote it into an equation , which they discovered accurately predicted people ’s happiness			1
the equation accurately predicts how happy people will say they are based on recent events			1
the formula , published in the @entity139 , was put together by studying 26 people who completed a decision - making task in which their choices led to monetary gains and losses			2
they were repeatedly asked how happy they were , and their brain activity was measured using mri scans			0
the scientists used the data to build a computer model , which was tested on 18,420 people using a smartphone app. the results confirmed that people who started off with lower expectations were happier when they had better results			1
the authors wrote : ‘ conscious emotional feelings , such as momentary happiness , are core to the ebb and flow of human mental experience			2
‘ our computational model suggests momentary happiness is a state that reflects not how well things are going but instead whether things are going better than expected			2
‘ this includes positive and negative expectations , even in the absence of outcomes			0
’ a recent study found that the articiulation of vowels influence how we feel and that the most positive letter is ' i ' while the most negative - and likely to make us feel sad or grumpy ( stock image ) is ' o ' researchers from @entity179 found the articulation of vowels influence how we feel			2
during tests , they tracked participants ' emotions by measuring changes in facial muscles linked with smiling and frowning , and found the most positive letter is ' i ’ and the most negative is ' o '			0
the team , led by the @entity189 - based psychologist professor @entity188 , was able to demonstrate the articulation of vowels systematically influences our feelings and vice versa			2
the scientists focused on the sound of the long ' i ' vowel and that of the long , closed ' o ' vowel			0
in the first experiment , the researchers asked participants to watch film clips designed to put them in a positive or a negative mood , and then asked them to make up ten artificial words and to speak them out loud			0
they found the artificial words that contained significantly more i 's than o 's when the test subjects were in a positive mood			0
in a second experiment that looked at the link between the sounds , mood and people 's facial muscles			0
they found that participants making the ' i ' sounds found things funnier than those making ' o ' noises			2
they believe that the tendency for ' i ' sounds to occur in positively charged words , such as ' like ' , and for ' o ' sounds to occur in negatively charged words , such as ' alone ' , in many languages appears to be linked to the corresponding use of facial muscles .			0
