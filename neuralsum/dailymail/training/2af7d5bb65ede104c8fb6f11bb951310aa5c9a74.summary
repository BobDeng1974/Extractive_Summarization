@entity0 has insisted he does not consider @entity2 ’s curse - laden tirade against him during the recent @entity4 match to have been racist			1
@entity2 , the @entity7 captain , is alleged to have told @entity9 ’s prince to ‘ f * * * off back to your own country , you kolpak f * * * * * ’ – a reference to the @entity14 ’s status as a non-overseas player – and has since been charged with using racist language by the @entity17			1
