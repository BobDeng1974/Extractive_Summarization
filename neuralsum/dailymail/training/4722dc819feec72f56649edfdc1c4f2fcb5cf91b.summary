a couple of years ago , i stepped off a plane at a small airport in a far corner of the planet , and caught a taxi into town			0
you do not really notice @entity9 as you enter it – because , despite marketing itself as the world ’s most southerly city , there is not a great deal of it			2
but what you do spot , about halfway through the cab ride , is the memorial to the @entity21 dead of the @entity22 , placed very prominently at the roadside			1
indeed , you can not miss it			0
this stark slab of iron – from which the outline of the @entity29 ( or @entity30 , as the @entity21 prefer to call it ) has been cut – could scarcely be described as pretty			2
but it makes a firm point : what happened in 1982 has not been forgotten here			0
under fire : the @entity36 team - with @entity38 centre of image , seated - while filming in @entity21 my mind has drifted back to that memorial over the last couple of days , as the furore over the actions of the @entity36 team , and its star @entity38 , has gathered momentum			1
for those of you who have missed this ‘ event ’ ( perhaps you have better things to do with your life , or perhaps you prefer some news with your news stories ) , @entity38 has been accused of angering the locals in southernmost @entity21 by driving around in a @entity57 whose number plate apparently references the @entity22			1
the plate in question reads ‘ @entity61 ’			2
a line of numbers and letters which has been taken by the @entity21 media to refer to the year of the conflict , 1982 – and the islands over which it was fought			1
cue unpleasant scenes in @entity9 , this outpost at the foot of @entity73 – with various reports of vehicles being pelted with stones , the @entity36 presenters being pursued to the @entity78 border by a mob , and police assistance required to get them out of the country			1
cause of controversy : @entity38 's 1991 @entity57 , with the number plate that has been seen as a war reference after the event : the same @entity57 is seen with damage to its windscreen after an encounter with a local mob all very unsavoury , then , with @entity36 cast , again , in an unpleasant light , and @entity9 – an important tourist destination – doing its image a considerable disservice			1
the city is the key point of access for the spectacular islands of @entity99 – the fractured lower tip of @entity73 – as well as voyages that venture to @entity103			0
but as with a juvenile spat in 2012 , where two @entity106 ships were refused harbour in a show of lingering bad feeling , @entity9 is once more in focus for reasons other than its glorious scenery			2
naturally , @entity36 has issued the requisite denials			2
the number plate was a coincidence , we have been told – a work of total chance			1
the 1991 @entity57 came with the plate when it was bought by the show back in august – acquired specifically for the 1350 - mile drive through @entity21 which has been filmed for the programme ’s 2014 @entity123 special			1
make of that what you will , although bear in mind that @entity38 has a record of trying to offend his hosts when filming @entity36 in overseas locations – in 2012 , he prompted complaints from the @entity134 high commission after driving in @entity134 with a lavatory strapped to the back of his fast @entity137 , in a glib pot - shot at the country ’s sanitation issues			1
doomed : the sinking of the @entity145 in 1982 was the most controversial moment in the @entity22 not forgotten : the @entity145 sailed from @entity9 in april 1982 - and its sinking is still keenly felt there perhaps the producers are telling the truth			1
perhaps serendipity has frowned upon @entity36 , handing it the equivalent of a @entity152 that it could not solve			0
but what should be very clear is that if this was a deliberate stunt , pulled by the makers of the show in a gesture of boys ’ - club humour , then it was both crass and insensitive			0
thirty - two years after its outbreak , the @entity22 is still a notoriously thorny issue between @entity106 and @entity21 – and it remains a highly troublesome topic in @entity9			1
the losses of the war are still keenly felt in the city because the conflict ’s most difficult moment – the sinking of the @entity21 warship @entity145 – had its roots here			1
the naval cruiser set sail from @entity9 on 26 april 1982			2
six days later , it was sunk by the @entity106 nuclear submarine @entity175 , with the deaths of 323 men on board			0
site of remembrance : @entity9 has a very visible memorial to the @entity21 dead of the @entity22 very much an emotive issue : the war is still a big topic in a city that played a direct role in the events of 1982 the incident has helped to keep the fires of the @entity30 debate aflame ever since			1
notoriously , the @entity145 was outside the 200 - mile exclusion zone around the archipelago that had been declared by @entity106 as a theatre of definite conflict – and was sailing west , away from the @entity30 , and back towards the @entity21 mainland			1
some naval officials in @entity21 – including @entity145 , the doomed vessel ’s captain – have described the sinking as a legitimate military act , revealing that the ship was mid-manoeuvre , and ready to attack			1
others , including some here in @entity106 , have called it a war crime			0
the rights and wrongs of the assault on the @entity145 are never likely to be resolved into one smooth narrative			0
but you do not need a degree in military history to understand that the subject is still emotive in a city that waved farewell to the dead men			0
nor do you need a masters in geography to appreciate that people are still upset in a place that sits just 400 miles from the @entity30 ( a hop and skip in a region of long distances and empty horizons )			0
and you do not need to be an apologist for @entity21 ’s aggression and invasion of the @entity30 in 1982 to realise that people mourn their loved ones who do not return home			2
missing the point : @entity38 's latest @entity235 defence fails to understand why people might be upset @entity21 lost 649 soldiers in the conflict			1
half of them passed through @entity9 en route to a watery grave			0
in other words , it is not a city where you make jokes about the war			0
it is certainly not a place where you make references that treat the drowning of so many sailors as if it were the result of a football match			0
or that most noxious of terms , ‘ banter ’			0
perhaps , as has been said , the number plate was an accident			1
but @entity38 ’s responses to the matter show he has n’t grasped why this has caused outrage			2
he has said via @entity235 : ‘ these war veterans we upset			0
mostly they were in the 20s			0
’ thus utterly missing the point			0
does he think that only soldiers who have seen service are affected by war ? that their families and children just shrug and carry on with their lives , oblivious ? no doubt the @entity36 team will repeat the coincidence claim until the story has faded into the background			2
no doubt the @entity123 special will be an enormous success , its viewing figures boosted by the controversy			0
no doubt it will go on to sell a huge number of dvds , and add to the reputed £ 150 million the show makes for the @entity287 every year			1
at the @entity288 : undeniably pretty , @entity9 can lay claim to being the most southerly city on the planet in happier moments : normally , @entity9 is a tourism destination where cruises for @entity103 start and finish if so , perhaps i could suggest a few more unforeseen coincidences of which the show could be an entirely blameless and wholly unfortunate victim in future episodes			1
what about a dash around northern @entity302 in cars that – good lord , who could ever have made the connection ? – accidentally refer to the 19,240 @entity106 men who were slaughtered on the first day of the @entity308 in july 1916 ? how about a quick jaunt to the beach at @entity311 with a number plate that – oh dear , if only we ’d spotted it in time – casually mentions the 11,000 @entity317 soldiers killed in the evacuation of 1940 ? what wit			2
oh my aching sides .			0
