by @entity1 reporter published : 00:41 est , 19 may 2012 updated : 07:59 est , 19 may 2012 an @entity3 woman who sent the @entity5 boy she adopted back to @entity6 on a one - way flight has been ordered to pay tens of thousands of dollars in child support			1
@entity9 will have to pay a lump sum of $ 150,000 to the child she named @entity12 but later abandoned , as well as $ 1,000 per month until he is an adult			2
on thursday a judge in @entity16 , @entity14 ruled that she must begin making the child support payments in june and continue to pay until the boy , who is now 10 years old , turns 18			1
@entity20 judge @entity19 said the $ 150,000 @entity9 must pay includes damages for breach of contract , legal fees and support for the boy			2
@entity14 nurse @entity9 took a trip to @entity5 in 2009 and met @entity28 , who she renamed @entity12 , in an orphanage			1
their meeting is pictured here @entity9 sent @entity32 back to @entity5 in april 2010 with a letter saying the child was disturbed and violent and she did not want him anymore			1
the case created an international uproar and prompted @entity5 to temporarily halt its adoption program with the @entity3 the @entity38 , which helped @entity9 adopt the child , then filed a lawsuit seeking child support			1
@entity9 has since moved to @entity41 , @entity42 and has failed to show up at any of the hearings , said @entity44 , an attorney for the adoption agency			0
she has hired a series of three @entity14 lawyers to represent her but the most recent one , he said , has been granted permission to leave the case			0
she did , however , hire a court reporter to attend the hearing			0
@entity28 , who is now nearly ten , lives in a suburb of @entity6 with his foster parents and other children who are having difficulties finding adoptive parents @entity9 filed a lawsuit last month in @entity42 against representatives of a @entity5 orphanage saying the @entity5 @entity61 annulled the adoption			1
' in doing so , it denied defendants the ability to recover a sum of money in the form of child support from plaintiff , ' the suit says			0
@entity9 wants the @entity42 court to recognise the @entity5 decision			2
adoption advocates hailed the @entity14 court order as a measure of justice for the boy , and said the judge 's decision would show there are consequences to abandoning adopted children			0
@entity9 apparently never told social workers that she was having problems with the boy			0
worth forgetting : a swing set in @entity9 's shared back yard in @entity14 is part of the life @entity28 hopes to forget			1
he no longer speaks any @entity90 and calls his foster mother mama happier times : @entity28 now calls @entity93 , right , @entity94			0
@entity95 , left , has a special interest in @entity28 's case and makes periodic visits to the @entity99 in @entity100 where @entity28 is living the agency sued @entity9 to deter others from doing anything similar and to show the @entity5 that ' you can not do this in @entity3 and get away with it , ' mr @entity44 said			1
' it has certainly caused concern on the part of @entity5 officials that unless there are consequences when a parent abandons a child placed in their home , there 's a need for safeguards to make sure this never occurs , ' he added			0
the judge said in his order that when @entity9 adopted the boy she signed a contract acknowledging that it was possible the child could have physical , emotional or behaviour problems that were unreported and even unknown to the adoption agency			1
@entity19 said $ 58,000 of the $ 150,000 will pay for the past two years ' worth of support and medical fees for the boy in @entity5			2
court documents say the boy was hospitalised for three weeks after he returned to @entity6 , but they do not say what he was treated for			0
he was later moved to an orphanage and then sent to another institution .			0

@entity9 adopted @entity28 in 2009 and sent him back to @entity5 in 2010
must support him for the next eight years until he turns 18
