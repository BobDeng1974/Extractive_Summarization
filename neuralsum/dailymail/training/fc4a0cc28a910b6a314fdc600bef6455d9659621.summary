@entity0 have sent their @entity2 groundsman @entity1 to sort out the pitches they will have to play on during the @entity4 after serious concerns that their players would be risking injury on sub-standard surfaces			1
@entity0 are due to fly out to @entity9 on december 14 for the seven - team tournament that could see them win their fourth trophy of the year but there are real concerns that their season will be derailed by serious injury to top players because of the state of the pitch at @entity20 where they play their semi-final on december 16 against the winner of @entity24 from @entity25 and @entity26			2
real ‘ signed ’ @entity1 from @entity32 in 2009 after he had excelled in the @entity33 and @entity0 saw him as the cure for on - going problems with their own @entity31 pitch			1
@entity0 are concerned their players could pick up injuries playing on poor quality pitches he has produced the perfect playing surface in @entity0 for @entity38 , @entity39 and now @entity40 but he also inspects the pitches @entity0 have to play on beyond @entity43 borders			1
@entity1 visited the @entity44 which is home to far @entity20 at the end of october and returned and was not impressed with what he saw			0
the venue will host the first three matches of the tournament and then @entity0 ’s semi-final			0
@entity1 is over-seeing urgent repair work on the playing surface which @entity0 ’s potential rivals in the @entity55 final , @entity56 , will not have to play on because they play their semi-final in @entity58 where the final will also be held			0
@entity1 was responsible for the immaculate pitch at @entity61 before moving to @entity43 to join @entity0 on @entity1 ’ advice @entity0 have asked @entity63 to allow them to arrive just two days before they play their first game in @entity9 enabling them to fit another training session in at their own @entity67 training ground and not in @entity20			1
it is not unusual for @entity1 to inspect conditions before @entity0 have to play – he also flies to the @entity70 ahead of pre-season tours to check facilities and pitch standards			2
the three - times winner of the @entity75 of the year award at @entity32 joined the @entity77 in 1996 as an 18 - year - old after starting his career at @entity80			0
he took over as head groundsman of @entity32 ’s former home @entity61 four years later before @entity0 swooped in 2009			2
the @entity43 giants struggled for years with the condition of the @entity85 pitch before @entity1 joined them			0
