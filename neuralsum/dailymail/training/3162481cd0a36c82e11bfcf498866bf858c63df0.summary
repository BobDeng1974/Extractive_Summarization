a girl with a food phobia has lived off a diet of chips and cheese for five years - because she claims anything else makes her feel sick			1
@entity6 , 17 , eats mostly oven chips and is so repulsed by the thought of eating meat and vegetables she apparently heaves at the sight of them			1
the teenager , from @entity14 , in @entity15 , @entity16 , claims she has n't been able to finish a proper meal in years - and can only extend her diet to the occasional bowl of pasta or boiled potatoes			2
the college student is thought to suffer from a condition known as @entity39			1
this causes sufferers to be anxious or nauseous when they 're presented with new or feared food , leaving them at greater risk of extreme weight loss and malnutrition			2
@entity6 's eating habits , thought to be one the main reasons she regularly faints in public , have caused her weight to plummet to just 6st 10lbs			1
at just 5ft tall , this means her @entity50 of 18.4			2
is below the healthy range			2
the teenager said : ' i used to live off mostly chicken , but now the smell makes me sick			0
' it feels like the older i get , the fewer foods i can actually stomach , but i ca n't go wrong with chips and cheese			1
' but they have to be @entity62 oven chips			1
' it affects my everyday life , not so much the eating around people or out , but the symptoms that come with the health issues it has caused			1
' i ca n't go one day without feeling completely exhausted or ill at at - least one point			2
it 's like a never ending cycle of hell			0
' although @entity6 was a fussy eater throughout her childhood , it was n't until she turned 16 that she realised her eating habits had spiralled out of control			1
but it was only when she smashed her head on a concrete floor after fainting on her first day of work experience that she decided to go to the doctors for help			1
tests revealed she was deficient in iron and vitamin b12			0
doctors then suggested @entity6 's food phobia could be @entity39 and have referred her to a specialist for formal diagnosis			1
fussy : @entity6 will usually skip breakfast , have a plate of chips and cheese for lunch at college and pick at whatever her mother @entity99 , 41 ( pictured ) makes her for dinner she said : ' i 've fainted a total of five times now , and each time was different			1
' one time i was shaking and when i came round i was still shaking - it was terrifying			0
' i find myself getting very easily upset by it			0
i 'll look in the mirror and think " i 'm nothing but skin and bones " and " is this how people see me ? " ' @entity6 will usually skip breakfast , have a plate of chips and cheese for lunch at college and pick at whatever her mother @entity99 , 41 , puts in front of her at dinner			1
the @entity119 has described @entity39 ( @entity39 ) as : ‘ a little - studied phenomenon of eating a highly limited range of foods , associated with an unwillingness to try new foods			1
' when this happens social avoidance , anxiety and conflict can result			0
’ pilot studies in @entity130 have found many thousands of people who seem to fit the criteria for the disorder			0
but @entity39 should not be confused with normal childhood fussiness			1
according to the @entity135 , about 12 per cent of three - year - olds suffer from persistent selective eating — extremely faddy about their food — but fewer than one per cent carry it into adulthood			2
she said : ' there is nothing worse than having a beautiful meal put down to you and going to take the first bite and thinking i ca n't put this in my mouth			0
' no matter how much i want to eat it , i ca n't			0
' i 've always had major issues with meats			0
the fat on it is just sickening			0
' on school days i would n't eat breakfast or lunch - instead , i 'd live off a @entity158 and a small part of my dinner at night , no breakfast or anything			0
her mother added : ' @entity6 's eating habits really scare me			1
she seems to go through stages where she improves slightly but they never last very long			0
' to be honest , her food phobia started at primary school , with her mainly avoiding red meat			2
' but it has spiralled and can result in her eating virtually nothing in a day			1
' i have let @entity173 make a shopping list and buy the foods she wants , but even this can fail			0
' she will often come shopping with me and i let her get what she wants - but this mainly consists of junk food			0
' i support @entity173 , as does the rest of the family , i attend doctor 's appointments and dietitian appointments with her and will support her to overcome this disorder			0
' @entity6 , who hopes to start university in september , is terrified her phobia of food will only get worse when she moves away from home			1
but having been recently referred to a specialist by her gp , she is finally hoping to be diagnosed with @entity39 so she can get the therapy she needs			1
support : mrs @entity6 said her daughter 's eating habits terrify her			1
' she seems to go through stages where she improves slightly , but they never last very long ' ' i 'm quite fearful about going to university , i 've got used to eating around people i know but being around people i do n't will be scary			2
' i feel i will have to explain my situation in case i faint or do n't eat in front of people			0
' the foods i know i ca n't eat make me nervous as i know i need to eat them for the nutrients and that makes me upset			0
' i can still get nervous when eating out but i 've learned to brush it off			2
the only thing that scares me most is what could come from my eating or lack of eating			2
' what if i fainted and no one was around to help me and i never woke up ? i 've worked hard myself to get to the stage that i 'm at but i feel it slipping away as more foods are added to my " ca n't to eat list "			0
' hopefully a proper diagnosis will help me get the therapy i need			0
