i totally applaud @entity2 ’s decision to try @entity3 on the right wing in @entity5 , even if it backfires and possibly costs @entity6 the @entity7			1
it is the bold move of a coach who is deadly serious about winning the @entity10 — and that really excites me			1
the @entity14 - @entity13 combination at centre was a big success last season and with both now fit and available it makes sense to reunite them			1
but you want all your best players involved and @entity3 is fresh , confident and playing well			1
what are the pluses ? @entity3 is a world - class strike runner but because he has to be closely marked at all times he can also be the perfect decoy			2
it is possible he will hardly touch the ball in @entity5 but indirectly contribute to two or three @entity6 tries			0
@entity3 may look nothing like @entity39 but tactically he provides the same threat because he is nigh on unstoppable one - on - one if he takes the ball at pace in the right area			1
centre of attention : @entity13 is set to start in the centre for @entity6 my dream scenario for @entity48 would be any attacking @entity6 scrum anywhere from five to 25 metres out with a biggish blindside on the right			1
put @entity3 out there deep on his own and line up all the other backs going left			1
all @entity55 would then need is a solid scrum or a slight wheel to help take the @entity23 ’ back row out of the equation and it ’s game on			1
a perfectly timed pass to @entity3 at full tilt will leave only one defender to beat			2
@entity39 once scored a beauty under the posts against @entity65 using the same move			0
world - class strike runner : @entity3 can provide the perfect decoy on the attack : sir @entity70 believes @entity3 can have a similar impact on the wing as @entity39 @entity23 might put an extra man in defence on the blindside			1
in which case call their bluff and go left			0
the predictable thing would have been to start @entity3 at @entity80 again but that is why i like this selection — the @entity23 back line will be starting from scratch in how to deal with him from the wing , while facing another threat in @entity14			1
what are the negatives ? @entity3 does n’t turn that quickly and although he may be competent under the high ball , you do n’t get much practice in midfield			2
@entity23 ’s tactical kickers , as well as testing him with a few bombs , will roll little grubbers behind him and get @entity3 going backwards			1
under pressure , he could make mistakes			0
i enjoyed @entity103 ’s frankness when questioned about @entity3 ’s aerial skills , saying @entity3 will thump anyone who beats him to the ball			2
it reminded me of when i first selected @entity39 at full back against @entity108 in 2001			0
wrecking ball : the decision to pair @entity14 with @entity13 at centre is a positive one at 5ft 8in many doubted his ability under the high ball			1
i was sitting with @entity39 when he was asked how he was going to deal with that situation			0
‘ i ’ll jump , ’ was his response			0
selection is about picking players for what they can do — not based on perceived weaknesses			0
@entity3 needs to stay alert			2
on the @entity122 tour of @entity123 in 1980 i was moved from the centre to the right wing in the third test			2
we led 10 - 6 with 10 minutes to go when @entity128 kicked long into our 25 and i side - footed into touch			0
fatally , i turned my back as i jogged back into my unaccustomed position and the @entity123 struck			0
@entity133 threw a quick line - out to @entity135 and although i got back to make a tackle he offloaded to @entity137 and they were in for a converted try			2
we lost 12 - 10			0
do n’t switch off for a second			0
especially if you are a centre who has just moved to the wing !			0

the decision to switch @entity3 to the right wing is the bold move of a coach who is deadly serious about winning the @entity10
both @entity14 and @entity13 are now fit and available it makes sense to reunite them at centre
the @entity23 back line will be starting from scratch in how to deal with @entity3 from the wing , while facing another threat in @entity14
