@entity0 's police and crime commissioner @entity1 has resigned after weeks of pressure @entity4 's crime tsar finally caved in to three weeks of public outrage and quit yesterday over the sexual abuse of 1,400 children in the town			1
@entity1 , who had defied demands from political leaders of all parties to resign as @entity0 ’s police and crime commissioner and refused to see why he should take any blame , claimed he was leaving ‘ for the sake of the victims ’			2
an acting commissioner will be appointed until a by - election is held , but former home secretary @entity19 , who was among the mps to welcome mr @entity1 ’s departure , rejected calls to stand as the region ’s next @entity23			1
it later emerged mr @entity1 will not get a severance pay - off , but will keep his local authority pension , which he can claim from the age of 55			1
mr @entity1 has faced demands to quit since a report by professor @entity31 revealed that the authorities had repeatedly ignored warnings about the abuse of children by predominantly @entity37 men in @entity4 over 16 years			1
for five years until 2010 , mr @entity1 was at the heart of official failure to tackle the problem as the @entity42 councillor in charge of children ’s services			1
he later successfully stood for election as the party ’s @entity23 candidate			0
he refused to quit after the report ’s publication last month , despite calls by the prime minister , the home secretary , the deputy prime minister and @entity42 chiefs			0
he resigned from the party , pre-empting @entity42 attempts to sack him , but remained determined to hold on to his £ 85,000 - a - year @entity23 job even after a humiliating appearance before a committee of @entity20 and emotional scenes at a public meeting in @entity4 , where women who had been abused as children denounced him			1
but yesterday he issued a statement saying the row was ‘ detracting from the important issue , which should be everybody ’s focus – the 1,400 victims in the report – and in providing support to victims and bringing to justice the criminals responsible for the atrocious crimes committed against them ’			2
‘ with this in mind , ’ he added , ‘ i feel it is now right to step down			0
for the sake of those victims , for the sake of the public of @entity0 and to ensure the important issues outlined in the report about tackling child sexual exploitation can be discussed and considered in full and without distraction			2
the woman , whose 17 - year - old daughter claims she was groomed on social media and abused by men in the region , said : ‘ i hope he ’s the first in a long line			0
‘ we need to get the rest of them out and then we ’ll know that children in @entity4 are safe			0
’ @entity107 , @entity42 mp for @entity4 , said she was delighted mr @entity1 had quit , but frustrated he did not do so as soon as the report came out because ‘ he has taken the attention away from the victims and he has become the story			1
it is like a double insult to the victims and because of that i still feel very angry towards him ’			0
@entity117 , the @entity42 mp for @entity118 , said mr @entity1 had ‘ finally done the decent thing ’ but for many it was ‘ too little , too late ’			1
he added mr @entity1 had ‘ failed the people of @entity4 and to try to remain in his post as police and crime commissioner was an insult to the victims and their families ’			1
mr @entity19 said it was a great pity that mr @entity1 did not step down immediately			1
@entity129 , the home secretary , said she was pleased he had quit , adding : ‘ it is right that where people failed in their duty they should take responsibility			0
the police and local council failed the victims of these awful crimes and failed the people of @entity4			0
’ mr @entity1 has been harangued in public meetings since the report revealed ' blatant ' failures by authorities @entity4 child abuse victim @entity144 , whose sister @entity145 was murdered by a member of an @entity37 paedophile ring , confronted @entity0 police chief @entity1 earlier this month ' my role as @entity150 has clearly become prominent in terms of public opinion and media coverage following the publication of professor @entity31 's report			1
' this is detracting from the important issue , which should be everybody 's focus - the 1,400 victims outlined in the report - and in providing support to victims and bringing to justice the criminals responsible for the atrocious crimes committed against them			2
' with this in mind , i feel that it is now right , to step down from the position of @entity23 for @entity0 , for the sake of those victims , for the sake of the public of @entity0 and to ensure that the important issues outlined in the report about tackling child sexual exploitation can be discussed and considered in full and without distraction			2
' as i 've previously stated , i entered into public service to make a positive difference in @entity0			0
' protecting vulnerable people and particularly victims of child sexual exploitation has been my number one priority as commissioner and much progress has been made over the last two years			0
' my intention had always been to continue my work with @entity150 and partners in making all the necessary changes and improvements required to safeguard and support the victims of these horrific crimes , and indeed to protect further potential victims through preventative actions			0
' on resigning , i therefore truly wish the force , all the very best in continuing the journey of positive transformational change of those essential services which protect and support our most vulnerable people			0

@entity1 was in charge of children 's services before police role
he was told to stand down after *damning* report into child abuse
but he clung onto his £ 85,000 role for weeks , *insisting* he had support
mr @entity1 finally resigned today , claiming it was ' for the sake of victims '
but it emerged he will keep his pension , which he can claim aged just 55
he has been harangued in public meetings since the *inquiry* reported
calls for mp @entity19 to take over role , but he *insists* : ' i *'m* an mp '
