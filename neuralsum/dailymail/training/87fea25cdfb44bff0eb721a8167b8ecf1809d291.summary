by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:45 est , 8 august 2013 updated : 18:46 est , 8 august 2013 @entity2 go home : a protester in @entity5 yesterday @entity6 warned last night that @entity8 was ‘ missing out big time ’ on the benefits of fracking by not drilling at enough sites in the search for shale gas			1
in his most outspoken comments about the technology , the prime minister said it would be a ‘ big mistake ’ if the government did not encourage fracking across @entity8			1
mr @entity6 said the government would dispel ‘ myths ’ from green groups that drilling for gas would lead to earthquakes , and he dismissed fears that it could lead to water taps catching fire			1
but campaigners last night accused him of lying about the dangers , as he suggested the @entity8 should copy the @entity31 , where thousands of wells have been bored			0
addressing a question and answer session in @entity36 , the prime minister said : ‘ i will just give you one figure to show how much we are missing out			0
' in the whole of the @entity42 last year there were 100 shale gas wells dug			1
‘ at the same time in the @entity31 there were 10,000			0
‘ now , the @entity42 has about three quarters as much shale gas as the @entity31 so we are missing out big time at the moment and i want to make sure @entity8 does n’t miss out			1
@entity6 warned last night that @entity8 was ' missing out big time ' on the benefits of fracking by not drilling at enough sites in the search for shale gas fracking demonstrators at @entity57 , @entity58			1
mr @entity6 said the government would dispel ' myths ' from green groups that drilling for gas would lead to earthquakes , and he dismissed fears that it could lead to water taps catching fire ‘ their gas prices are about half the level of ours			1
so we would be making a big mistake if we did n’t think hard about how to encourage fracking and cheaper gas prices			1
’ forty wells are expected to be drilled before the 2015 general election , half in the @entity78			0
but there could be widespread drilling across the @entity81			1
@entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 are thought to contain gas reserves			2
mr @entity6 said : ‘ nothing is going to happen in this country unless it ’s environmentally safe			0
‘ there are some myths that we have to dispel			1
there is no question of having earthquakes and fire coming out of taps			2
’ police escort a lorry towards a proposed fracking site at @entity57 but he mistakenly promised communities where wells are drilled that they will get £ 1million compensation – ten times the amount actually proposed			2
@entity105 confirmed he had been mistaken and that @entity59 policy has not changed			1
he also told staff at @entity108 in @entity109 : ‘ if people can see a direct benefit from fracking and shale gas , they will be more willing to really look at the arguments about what this will mean for their community if it goes ahead			1
‘ in that way we can see wells dug and we can see the benefits of shale gas here in the @entity8			2
’ but he was forced to dodge anti-fracking campaigners by sneaking into @entity126 through a children ’s playground			0
protest organiser @entity128 , 56 , said : ‘ @entity6 does not care about the dangers because it is all going to be in the “ desolate ” @entity78			0
we are the ones who will have to live with the consequences			0
' this is not a safe process – we know that already because the last time they drilled we had earthquakes			2
’ @entity139 , 52 , who changed his name by deed poll and runs the @entity143 group , said : ‘ he is not telling the truth about fracking			2
‘ we are worried about our water supplies and our houses toppling down and these issues need to be addressed			0
’ @entity150 , chief executive of the @entity151 , said : ‘ any language that implies that a decision has been taken and that people will be forced to accept fracking is bound to raise hackles and increase concerns			0
‘ companies drilling the wells are well aware of the need to get people on side and do proper consultations			0
if they do n’t do that in the @entity166 or the @entity167 , you ’re going to have an uprising			0

@entity2 said it would be ' big mistake if @entity59 did not encourage fracking
wants to dispel ' myths ' that drilling for gas leads to earthquakes
