getting out of bed to draw the curtains may soon be a thing of the past after scientists developed revolutionary technology that changes the transparency of windows			1
the @entity9 - enabled window shade , designed by @entity12 start - up @entity10 , can be stuck to any glass including windows , showers and mirrors and can be controlled wirelessly using a smartphone			1
the energy - saving film also provides uv protection , can save money on heating bills by controlling the amount of heat that enters your home , and doubles up as a video projector screen			1
an electricity conducting clip is fixed to the film which is then plugged into your home 's electrics			1
when an electric current is applied , the blind goes see - through and when it is cut off it goes opaque @entity10 film uses smart glass technology , also called smart windows or switchable windows			1
it has rod - like particles suspended in liquid placed between two plastic layers			0
when there is no electric current applied to the film , the suspended particles are arranged randomly and absorb light			1
this makes the glass panel look dark , or opaque			2
when a voltage is applied , the suspended particles join up and let light pass through			0
spds can be manually or automatically ' tuned ' to let users control the amount of light , glare and heat that comes through			0
it can help control heating bills and reduce carbon emissions			0
@entity10 film is the first ever ' @entity9 - enabled digital shade ' that instantly switches from opaque to clear in one second			1
it is sold in one - by - one metre strips with an installation kit , including conducting clips that fit to the top of the film , and an electric cable			2
when an electric current is passed through the particles in the blind it makes it see - through			0
when the current is turned off , the film becomes opaque			1
the film uses smart glass technology			2
it has rod - like particles suspended in liquid placed between two plastic layers			0
the level of opacity on the @entity10 film can be customised and the film is made of plastic that can be cut to size			1
the film contains particles that line up when an electric current is put through it			2
this makes the film look dark			2
when the electricity is cut off the particles disperse randomly and they let in the light power – 110 - 220vac frequency – @entity102 current – 0.05 amperes per m2 power – less than 5 watts per m2 ( power is consumed only in the ( on ) transparent state ) thickness – 0.4mm viewing angle – more than 140 degrees light transmittance – on ( 70 % ) off ( 5 % ) haze coefficient – on ( 7 % ) off ( 87 % ) @entity110 – absorbs +85 % infrared – reflects +70 % when there is no electric current applied to the film , the suspended particles are arranged randomly and absorb light			2
this makes the glass panel look dark , or opaque			2
when a voltage is applied , the suspended particles join up and let light pass through			0
the film can be manually or automatically ' tuned ' to let users control the amount of light , glare and heat that comes through			2
it can help control heating bills and reduce carbon emissions			0
the film is less than half a millimetre thick			0
it only uses electricity when in the ' on ' state and uses less than 5 watts per metre squared			0
it absorbs more than 85 per cent of uv rays and reflects over 70 per cent of infrared rays			0
the basic package costs £ 160 ( $ 250 )			0
for £ 180 ( $ 280 ) the package additionally comes with a @entity9 - enabled transformer that connects to your home network			0
when connected to the transformer , the film can be controlled using a free smartphone app. once the film is cut to size and stuck onto a glass covering ( left ) electronic clips are applied that can be plugged into a @entity9 - enabled transformer and can be connected to your home network			1
once connected , the blind can be made see - through or opaque using the smartphone app ( right ) the ' on ' button makes the film see - through and the ' off ' button turns the film opaque			1
the level of opacity can also be customised depending on the level of privacy you want and the film can also be cut to shape to fit skylights or other smaller glass coverings			0
the firm has now launched a @entity167 campaign to raise more money to produce and ship the film			0
@entity10 has until 3 july to raise the target of £ 128,000 ( $ 200,000 )			1
the @entity10 film can be cut to fit any glass covering including showers and bathroom windows			1
a one - by - one metre film with installation kit and @entity9 enabled transformer costs £ 179 ( $ 280 ) video : everything you want to know about @entity10 film			1

@entity10 film can be stuck to windows or shower doors and can be made opaque or clear at the touch of a button
it can be controlled wirelessly using an @entity190 or @entity191 smartphone app
