by @entity0 inspectors found raw and cooked meat mixed together , filthy surfaces and poorly trained staff when they visited @entity7 ’s flagship restaurant in @entity8 , it has emerged			1
the four - star @entity9 , which is on the 25th floor of @entity12 , was given a zero food hygiene rating from environmental health officers earlier this year			1
it has now been revealed that inspectors found examples of cross-contamination at the premises including raw and cooked food being stored together and the same equipment being used for both			1
@entity7 's flagship steakhouse , on the 25th floor of @entity12 in @entity8 ( pictured ) , has been given a zero rating by food safety inspectors a restaurant spokesman has confirmed the rating , but said staff are working with the council to address the issues according to a document obtained by @entity32 , the management were ordered to carry out a thorough clean of the surfaces and equipment at the restaurant and train staff on food hygiene and hazard assessment			1
the steakhouse , which boasts stunning views of @entity8 , opened in december 2011 and meals cost around £ 50 per head			1
the abysmal zero rating found the restaurant ’s food hygiene and safety to be ‘ bad ’ , while structural compliance was deemed ‘ poor ’			1
officers also stated they had no confidence in the management			2
the rating relates to either poor standards of hygiene structure , confidence in management or a combination of these factors and now means urgent improvement is necessary			1
after news of the inspection emerged last week , a @entity61 spokeswoman said : ' @entity7 was informed their @entity64 ( @entity64 ) rating would drop and it has been published on the @entity64 website			1
' a certificate and window sticker confirming their zero rating was sent to the restaurant on march 25 , 2014			0
' despite the bad review , a spokesman from @entity7 said they have acted on what needed addressing and continue to work closely with the council			2
the spokesman said : ' we can confirm that we received a visit from the @entity81 of @entity61 earlier this year			0
@entity7 trained with @entity82 and @entity83 at @entity84 and @entity82 once described him as ' my little bunny ' ' the feedback was provided in an informal manner by the eho with some recommendations			0
' these were acted on by the management team and subsequent revisits have been very positive			0
' we continue to work closely with @entity61 and have appointed a third party food safety consultant to ensure we remain up to date with the rigorous industry regulations and the ongoing changes in legislation and practice			0
' the zero rating will remain valid , until the date of the next inspection , which could be between six and 18 months ’ time			0
the restaurant can call inspectors back in the meantime if staff believe standards have improved , but so far the @entity64 has not revisited			2
the @entity108 joins a list of 140 eateries in @entity8 with a zero rating			0
the @entity61 spokesman added : ' in @entity8 most food business operate to a good standard , but if they fall below satisfactory standards , our officers carry out revisits and take proportionate enforcement action to ensure that standards are improve			2
' where premises pose an imminent risk to health - e.g. where there is an active rodent infestation , severe drainage problems or filthy conditions - officers will act to close a business down immediately until it has rectified the problems			1
' this usually only takes a few days to allow the business to bring in proper systems and carry out necessary treatment and repairs			0
' on average , we will take emergency action on about 40 food businesses - from between 3,000 and 4,000 inspections - each year			0
' therefore a very small proportion of serious problems are found in food businesses and the public can be assured these are dealt with quickly			2
' the news comes after it was revealed @entity150 's upmarket butcher @entity151 , in the @entity152 , was forced to close after failing a health inspection			0
on that occasion food inspectors found mouse droppings , out of date wagyu beef and mouldy cow carcasses			2
@entity151 , next to @entity158 , was shut down for 24 hours when officers gave it the worst possible hygiene rating - branding it ' hazardous '			1
@entity161 was found growing on carcasses in the basement chillers and expensive meats including beef , oxtail , onglet , and @entity168 - style pork called @entity169			0
dirty slicers were also found , as well as old chicken which had been de-boned and vacuum packed to be relabelled with a later use - by date			0
