they are the heart of the home , the hub of dinner parties and usually the ‘ debrief of the day ’ meeting room			1
so what makes a great kitchen ? it ’s a balance between a warm and inviting design combined with practical efficiency			2
after judging the kitchens on @entity16 last week and taking into account what buyers look for in a kitchen , property buyers expert @entity14 gives his tips for ensuring great kitchen design			1
activity based design : the key to ensuring the practicality of your kitchen is to zone areas of the kitchen based on activities e.g. food preparation , cooking , clean - up etc. with storage for those activities within those zones			1
these areas need to be easily accessible to each other and flow well ( e.g. food preparation near the cooking area etc. )			0
there ’s no use in a pretty kitchen when your preparation area is on the opposite end of the kitchen from your stovetop			0
bench space : this is one of the most common bugbears when buyers are looking at kitchens			1
enough bench / counter space is crucial not only for food preparation but also for serving when entertaining			2
take into account what ’s most important for you in terms of storage , as i recommended a walk - in pantry vs a @entity77 ’s pantry , consider whether having extra space for preparation and a large area to hide your appliances is paramount to you or whether a larger area for food storage is more vital			1
judge @entity85 said @entity61 and @entity62 's kitchen ' did n't have their usual the flare , confidence or pizzazz ' sufficient lighting : as the @entity92 discussed when viewing @entity94 and @entity95 ’s kitchen , it ’s not an area of the home that you can get away with the ‘ bare bones ’ when it comes to lighting			1
for the purpose of safety in food preparation and cooking , good lighting is paramount			0
specifically in the preparation , cooking and cleaning areas , it ’s essential to have good quality lighting			0
@entity94 and @entity95 ’s kitchen lacked lighting above the benchtop according to @entity14 splash backs : in the cooking and cleaning zones of the kitchen , splashbacks are important and while design is also important , it should n’t be at the expense of practicality			1
try and find a good medium between something that looks great but is also low maintenance and easy to clean ! the judges were shocked that @entity94 and @entity95 's had overlooked lighting over the bench top given @entity95 's food styling background ventilation : akin to the bathroom , the kitchen requires great ventilation so ensure you have a good quality range hood and windows that can be opened			1
@entity14 says there was ' great ventilation ' in @entity138 and @entity140 ’s kitchen @entity138 and @entity140 had a range of issues this week with their kitchen , mainly due to it not being their original design , the couple were shocked with the largely positive feedback from the judges flow on : the overall design of your home really needs to come into play when designing a kitchen			1
the flow between the living areas , specifically dining areas and the kitchen are important			0
as we mentioned when judging @entity159 and @entity160 ’s and @entity138 and @entity140 ’s kitchens , a kitchen with a flow on to an outdoor entertaining area is very much in demand at the moment and a huge plus for buyers			2
@entity159 and @entity160 ’s kitchen had a ' great flow ' on from the living and dining areas @entity160 and @entity159 were able to edge ahead of their rival teams to pull off their second room reveal win and add $ 10,000 to their kitty @entity181 's example of a kitchen at 12 kyarra street in @entity183 that would attract buyers ' attention @entity14 gives his tips for ensuring great kitchen design in the end , @entity61 and @entity62 ’s kitchen for the @entity189 showed the best balance between design and a practical layout			1
while a kitchen is a very personal area of the home , make sure to take into account re-sale when renovating so that it does n’t affect the value of your property when you re-sell it			0
however , if @entity16 : @entity204 judges were the buyers this week , they would have walked away from each of the team 's apartments without placing an offer			2
judging trio @entity209 , @entity85 and @entity210 were all left largely unimpressed by the kitchens delivered by the @entity212 on last sunday night 's episode			0
the lacklustre performance , in the eye of the judges , meant that @entity160 and @entity159 were able to edge ahead of their rival teams to pull off their second room reveal win of the series and add $ 10,000 to their kitty			0
the judges were shocked that @entity94 and @entity95 's had overlooked lighting over the bench top given @entity95 's food styling background			0
@entity138 and @entity140 had a range of issues this week with their kitchen , mainly due to it not being their original design , the couple were shocked with the largely positive feedback from the judges			0
meanwhile , @entity85 said @entity61 and @entity62 's kitchen ' did n't have their usual the flare , confidence or pizzazz '			0
