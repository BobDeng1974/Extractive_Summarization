by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 it 's saturday , august 16 , 2014			1
as should be the case in the middle of summer , the weather is glorious and @entity6 is humming with anticipation ahead of the new season			1
the fixture list has presented @entity10 with a potentially tricky opening day assignment against @entity12 , who have strengthened their squad with experience and talent and are determined to get off to a sound start on the back of winning the @entity19			1
@entity46 , @entity48 ’s @entity47 international , is a prime target but negotiations will take time , as his club want £ 30million , given they owe 25 per cent of whatever transfer fee they receive to @entity56			1
@entity57 ’s @entity30 is an alternative to @entity46			1
a bid has been made for a 22 - year - old who has found starts hard to come by at the @entity61 ; another player with links to @entity66 , @entity32 , a highly - regarded 21 - year - old who spent last season at @entity68 , is coveted			1
future team - mates ? @entity46 ( right ) trains with @entity70 at the @entity47 training camp in @entity72 being watched : @entity57 midfielder @entity30 ( right ) trains with @entity73 in @entity74 ahead of the @entity75 as national team coach @entity76 looks on on the radar : @entity78 midfielder @entity32 ( right ) is a @entity10 target @entity10 , however , are not just looking to bolster their midfield			1
@entity83 left - back @entity81 , rated at £ 15million , is being closely monitored , along with @entity84 , the former @entity85 international who has returned to @entity87			2
a central defender is also on the list , which is not a surprise given that @entity10 shipped 50 goals last season – the rickety back line is the reason @entity27 ’ side were unable to become champions , a point proven by them conceding three goals on six occasions			2
@entity101 , the imposing @entity48 central defender who enjoyed an outstanding first year in the @entity25 , is admired by @entity10 , while @entity102 – a player with whom @entity27 worked when he was at @entity103 – is also being considered			1
eye on the ball : £ 15m - rated @entity83 left - back @entity81 ( right ) trains with @entity106 near @entity107 on monday @entity108 followed : @entity87 's @entity84 ( centre ) is being monitored by @entity10 there will , of course , be others but the identities will be known only by @entity27 and his inner circle			2
clearly , this is going to be a busy couple of months for @entity27 , who has extended his own stay at @entity6 after being given assurances he can compete at the top end of the transfer market , and his recruitment team , as the squad is not how he wants it to be			2
@entity27 ’ ambition during the close season is to add players with hunger and drive			0
@entity10 ’s ethos is to find players who are on the rise , with the appetite to prove themselves at the highest level , rather than going out to sign ‘ ready - made ’ stars			0
‘ the owners have shown me an unswerving commitment to what i want to do and that gives you confidence , ’ @entity27 explained before @entity10 played @entity135 in march			0
once you put your ideas in place and once the players start to crack it then we will have success			0
warm welcome : @entity48 defender @entity101 is preparing for the @entity75 with @entity149 history : @entity151 defender @entity102 ( front ) worked with @entity27 during his loan period at @entity103 ‘ money ca n’t buy that			2
@entity156 spend a billion quid and it does not guarantee anything			0
we will be in the market for good and top players but there is more to it than that			0
it is about coaching and man management ; dealing with people , having a great staff , finding a cause for the players to fight for			0
‘ all of that comes into it and that is something we have done in the period i have been here			0
we are starting to find momentum now and we hope it continues			0
the money is great and we will be in the market to compete but what is important is having a vision of how you want the club to progress			0
’ with that in mind , then , this is @entity190 ’s guess at @entity10 ’s line - up for the opening weekend ( 4 - 1 - 3 - 2 ) : @entity193 @entity70 , @entity194 , @entity101 , @entity195 @entity196 @entity197 , @entity46 , @entity198 @entity199 , @entity200 how does yours compare ? let us know in the comments section below			1
man with the golden shoe : @entity200 was the @entity25 's top goalscorer with 31 goals last season			1

play " fantasy manager " and pick your @entity209 for the opening day of the 2014 - 15 @entity25 season
@entity48 's @entity47 international @entity46 is a prime target
@entity68 midfielder @entity32 is also wanted at @entity6
