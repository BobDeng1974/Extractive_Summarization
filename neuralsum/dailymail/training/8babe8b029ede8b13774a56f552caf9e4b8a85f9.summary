she has claimed he had been distracted and withdrawn in the weeks before the aircraft 's disappearance the plane is thought to have flown hundreds of miles out over the southern @entity29 where it eventually ran out of fuel and plunged into the sea			0
no suicide note has been found and no motive established , but police are continuing to concentrate their inquiries on the pilot ’s background and whether his state of mind before the flight may be a factor			2
the @entity42 can reveal that the pilot ’s wife , @entity43 , has told investigators that he stopped speaking to her in the weeks before the fateful flight on march 8 , and spent time alone in his room where he had built a flight simulator			1
‘ he just retreated into a shell , ’ she said			1
meanwhile , @entity52 , 28 , the pilot ’s daughter , said that in her last conversations with her father , she barely recognised the man who used to dote on her			1
‘ he was n’t the father i knew			2
he seemed disturbed and lost in a world of his own , ’ she said			2
last week , @entity43 and @entity26 , along with other family members , were interviewed in detail by police in @entity63			2
the lengthy interviews , described in detail to @entity42 by a source close to the pilot ’s family , revealed that : family portrait : captain @entity52 with wife @entity43 and two of their children			1
he was reportedly on the brink of divorcing her after nearly 30 years of marriage plush : the family home in an upmarket @entity63 suburb despite the pilot ’s behaviour , his family are convinced that he was not responsible for the plane ’s disappearance @entity43 , who was just 16 when she first met @entity52 , broke down repeatedly during two lengthy interviews with police , the family source said			1
one of the interviews lasted more than four hours			2
she was initially reluctant to discuss the breakdown of her marriage , and refused to accept her husband might be involved in the flight ’s disappearance , protesting : ‘ it ’s unfair to blame my husband			1
’ however , over the course of the interviews , she told police how her husband became increasingly distracted in the months leading up to the flight			1
‘ i found him distant and difficult to understand , ’ she said			1
she told investigators that although they continued to live in the same house , @entity52 spent his time alone			1
@entity43 said her husband was so withdrawn he hardly spoke to his sons and was not close to them			0
‘ he just retreated into a shell , ’ she said			1
when he was n’t working , @entity52 spent ‘ more time with friends than with family members ’			1
she confirmed they had spoken of separating but had not taken any formal steps towards getting a divorce			2
the 53 - year - old pilot had been under suspicion after investigators discovered a flight simulator at his @entity63 home the pilot 's wife has told investigators that he stopped speaking to her in the weeks before the fateful flight on march 8 , and spent time alone in his room where he had built a flight simulator she said he appeared agitated and to be suffering from ‘ frayed nerves ’			1
of his three children , @entity52 appears to have been closest to @entity26 , who flew back from @entity126 , @entity127 , to be with her family after @entity10 went missing			1

he was distant and cranky			0
’ the hunt for the missing @entity4 aircraft was set to resume today			2
nine ships and ten planes will cover a 97,000sq mile area where search teams have so far failed to recover any confirmed debris from flight mh370			2
@entity144 aircraft have spotted objects that were white and red – the same colours as the aircraft – but these items have yet to be conclusively linked to the passenger jet , which disappeared three weeks ago with 239 passengers and crew on board			0
investigators hope that locating debris will help narrow the search for the ‘ black box ’ recorders			1
however , a shortage of live satellite data and adverse weather conditions are hampering the operation			0
the investigation is being led by the @entity19 authorities			0
meanwhile , the @entity165 is co-ordinating the search 1,150 miles off the coast of @entity168 in an area of the @entity29 that is one of the world ’s most remote and least researched areas			0
@entity26 said her father spoke to her about his marital problems and told her he did n’t think they could reconcile			0
in their conversations , he asked her how she would feel if her parents divorced			0
@entity26 said she tried to persuade her father to seek the help of @entity180 elders to try to mend the relationship but he refused			1
the daughter told investigators she did not know if there was another woman in her father ’s life			0
although @entity26 does not appear to have spoken to her father on the day the flight disappeared , she told investigators she knew from friends in @entity63 he was upset and felt ‘ utter frustration ’ over the jail sentence given to @entity193			1
@entity52 was a fervent supporter of @entity193 , a pro-democracy icon in @entity19 who was jailed for five years for sodomy hours before @entity10 took off for the final time			1
@entity193 ’s supporters believe it was a politically motivated prosecution			1
despite her father ’s personal problems , @entity26 told investigators she did not believe he could be in any way responsible for the flight ’s disappearance			2
‘ i do n’t believe he would ever intentionally endanger the lives of his crew and passengers , ’ she insisted			1
investigators also spoke to the pilot ’s two sons – @entity210 , 26 , a languages student , and @entity212			0
@entity210 told them he had ‘ barely spoken ’ to his father in the weeks before the flight disappeared , even though they shared the same house			1
@entity212 posted a message on @entity219 thanking someone for a poem written in support of his father which he said had helped to counter the ‘ wounds and sadness ’ from ‘ baseless accusations made against my father ’			2
police interviews with family members have confirmed that the pilot – who lived with his family in an upmarket suburb of the @entity19 capital , close to the international airport – did not have any obvious financial problems			2
the @entity42 revealed last weekend that police had not , at that time , interviewed the pilot ’s wife in detail , partly because of cultural sensitivities in asking direct questions to people in grief or distress			0
the plane is thought to have flown hundreds of miles out over the southern @entity29 where it eventually ran out of fuel and plunged into the sea the softly - softly approach frustrated @entity252 officials working alongside @entity19 federal police			0
@entity255 intelligence agents are also helping in the investigation , @entity42 has been told			0
news of the interviews came as the search for remains of the plane continued			0
a @entity144 and an @entity264 ship retrieved objects from the sea 1,150 miles off @entity168 , @entity127 , but none was confirmed to be from the missing flight			0
@entity144 aircraft also flew over the search area , and reported spotting three orange , white and red objects floating in the sea			0
however , officials cautioned that they may be junk rather than wreckage from the aircraft			0
@entity255 's only contribution to the vast fleet of vessels scouring the @entity29 in search of the jet is not expected to arrive until ‘ mid to late this week ’			2
survey ship @entity280 is sailing 6,000 miles to join the operation after its captain received orders in the @entity285 to head for the west coast of @entity127			0
last night former defence intelligence chief @entity288 sir @entity287 said @entity255 ’s contribution of one ship and no aircraft ‘ is an indictment of how we ’ve disarmed ourselves ’			2
he added : ‘ we decommissioned the @entity295 ’s fleet of @entity296 [ patrol aircraft ] and failed to replace it			0
with this we lost our maritime surveillance capability and a lot of expertise that would also have proved ideal			0
’ personnel from the @entity303 , the @entity304 and the @entity305 ( @entity305 ) are providing behind - the - scenes support to the search operation			0
the @entity308 is also assisting the @entity19 with imagery analysis			0
meanwhile , @entity144 has sent the largest number of ships assembled outside its national waters in modern history			0
defence experts in the region claim that @entity144 ’s vast flotilla of search vessels has a dual purpose – to send a warning signal to @entity321 and the @entity322 , its maritime rivals in the @entity324 , with whom it is embroiled in a number of territorial disputes .			0
