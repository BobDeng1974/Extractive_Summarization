@entity1 giant @entity0 announced today it is to shut one in six of its least profitable stores after its annual profits fell £ 75million last year			1
the home improvement chain is to close as many as 60 of its 360 stores over the next two years as part of a restructuring of its @entity13 and @entity14 business			1
shares in @entity16 , which trades as @entity0 and @entity17 in the @entity13 , jumped up 16p each - a five per cent rise - when the @entity18 opened this morning			1
changes : @entity0 is to close as many as 60 of its 360 stores over the next two years as part of a restructuring of its @entity13 and @entity14 business parent company @entity16 , which also owns @entity17 , plans to axe about 15 per cent of surplus space as a result of the review of its 360 - strong @entity0 estate			1
the move was announced as it posted a 7.5 per cent drop in annual profits to £ 675million after sales fell by 1.4 per cent to £ 11billion in the year to january 31			1
this is down from 744million in the 2013 - 14 year			0
the planned store closures form part of a plan by new chief executive @entity33 to shake - up the 360 - store @entity0 business			1
@entity16 , which trades as @entity0 and @entity17 in @entity13 and @entity36 and @entity37 in @entity38 , made a pre-tax profit of 675 million pounds in the year to january 31.the results are the first to be presented by @entity33 , who succeeded @entity40 in december			1
@entity33 said the closure plan was one of a number of ' sharp ' decisions being taken by the @entity46 company			2
she added : ' home improvement is a great market with huge potential and @entity16 has a strong position within it with further scope to grow in a sustainable way			0
however , it is clear to me that we need to organise ourselves very differently to unlock our potential			0
' other plans include cutting back on some of the 393,000 products sold across the company , particularly as only 7,000 - amounting to 7 per cent of sales - are currently sold in at least two of @entity16 's operating companies			2
the company will also look to optimise vacant store space and is in discussions with several retailers about sub-letting opportunities			0
@entity16 said the impact on jobs from the @entity0 store closure plan will be broadly neutral as it is opening about 60 outlets under the @entity17 brand , while it will also look to redeploy positions to other parts of the business			1
ms @entity33 denied that the @entity13 diy market was in decline and said the store closure plan reflected a desire to reinvigorate the company 's @entity13 offer			0
she added that it had long been clear that @entity0 had too many stores in its estate			1
@entity0 @entity13 & @entity14 's total sales were up 1.9 per cent to £ 3.7 billion in the financial year , with sales of outdoor seasonal and building products up 4 per cent			1
profits were 16 per cent higher at £ 276million			2
in contrast , profits in @entity38 were 12 per cent lower at £ 349 million due to the impact of weak consumer confidence and a declining housing and construction market			2
@entity16 said it will close a small number of stores in the country			2
it came as @entity16 , which had a binding agreement to buy @entity38 rival mr @entity97 , was forced to pull out of the £ 200m deal			0
the acquisition had been referred to competition authorities because @entity16 already owns @entity36 and @entity37 in @entity38			0
while it had the backing of a key shareholder , support was withdrawn by franchisee group the @entity110 des @entity107 du @entity106 ( @entity108 ) , which holds a 42pc stake in mr @entity97			0
forty - four of mr @entity97 's 500 stores , many of them franchises , would had to have been sold to placate regulators			0
it has since emerged that today was the deadline for the deal and all parties had to agree if there was an extension .			0

@entity0 will shut one in six of its least profitable stores in next two years
its annual profits were down £ 75m to £ 675m to the end of january
@entity1 giant will also reduce number of products and sub-let parts of stores
