@entity0 responded to his @entity2 critics with one of the passes of the season and a sensational free - kick in his side 's 3 - 0 win over @entity9 but still could n't please everyone at the @entity11			1
the @entity12 was accused of being selfish after @entity2 's first defeat in 22 games last weekend away to @entity15 but there was nothing selfish about his glorious 40 - yard crossfield pass on 12 minutes that dropped on @entity21 's toe enabling him to cross first time for @entity23 to score @entity2 's opener			1
and then on 20 minutes @entity0 took a free - kick from 30 - yards out and hammered it home off the inside of @entity9 keeper @entity27 's left - hand upright with @entity21 looking on			1

subs not used : @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 booked : @entity65 , @entity83 , @entity73 , @entity77 ref : @entity84 att : 69,600 but in the second half @entity0 raced down the right and when he failed to play in @entity21 who was charging through the centre the @entity40 reacted furiously shouting ' puta ' ( f * * * ) and some supporters inside the stadium jeered @entity0 for having shot wide and ignoring @entity21			1
after the game , @entity2 manager @entity92 said he will take action if he sees any sign of selfishness among his players			1
' @entity0 has played a very , very good game			0
he 's played with intensity and he 's scored , ' @entity92 said			0
' it could be that at that moment the fans have asked for a pass to @entity21 which has n't happened and like all strikers who are in front of goal he tried to score			0
' he added : ' altruism is a very important component of the team this season			0
' if there is any play which seems selfish we 'll clearly fix it			0
we have fans who demand a lot			0
@entity0 is a fundamental player like @entity21 and for that the fans demand much more than of others			2
' @entity21 who should pick up his second consecutive @entity118 on monday amost scored the third just before the break but delayed his shot and then failed to find a team - mate with a clever back heel into the area			2
supporters inside the @entity11 sang ' @entity126 ' throughout and were upset midway through the second half when he was booked for protesting the bizarre sending off of his best friend at the club @entity51			2
the fellow @entity40 international needed treatment after a 50 - 50 clash with @entity9 's former @entity133 midfielder @entity132			0
after what looked like a harmless collision that left both players needing lengthy treatment referee @entity137 stunned everyone pulling out a straight red card for @entity51 while not even showing a yellow to @entity132			0
@entity9 players observe a minute 's silence for the victims of the @entity145 terrorist attacks in @entity146 @entity147 1 @entity47 ( right ) parades the @entity149 trophy ahead of the game @entity21 was restored to the starting line - up after starting the last game on the bench with a troublesome knee @entity0 and @entity21 combined before sliding a pass for @entity23 to open the scoring at the @entity157 with a sidefoot finish the extra man did nothing to aid @entity9 as they tried to get back into the game			1
it was after the sending off that @entity0 's miss – and failure to pass to @entity21 – came and it was also when substitute defender @entity42 appeared at the back post to head in @entity48 's cross from the left			1
the win for @entity2 ended what had laughingly been called a crisis			0
they had lost their @entity174 record - breaking run of straight wins the previous weekend at @entity176 and then lost the first leg of their @entity179 last - 16 game against @entity180			1
it was suggested the @entity183 winners badge now emblazoned on their shirts after they beat @entity187 in @entity188 in december had cursed them but the badge had not weighed too heavy here as they made light work of @entity9			0
they can now sit back and watch @entity195 entertain @entity180 on sundayat the @entity196 knowing that whatever the result they will gain ground on at least one of their title rivals			2
then on thursday they will have the opportunity to come back from the 2 - 0 first leg reverse in the @entity179 against @entity205 's side			2
before that @entity21 will expect to be crowned the world 's best player once again			0
