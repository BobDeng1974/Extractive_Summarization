by @entity0 published : 21:28 est , 14 february 2013 updated : 03:59 est , 15 february 2013 boys as young as 11 and 12 are sending sexually explicit messages to girls via social media , @entity2 's childhood guru warned today			1
@entity7 , mp for @entity8 , said ' sexting ' , which included young boys sending images of their genitalia to girls , was increasingly commonplace in schools			1
the problem cuts across the social divide , she said during a debate in the @entity18 about the need to end violence against women , telling mps she had heard of a serious case of sexual abuse at a leading independent school			1
@entity7 , mp for @entity8 , said boys as young as 11 and 12 are sending sexually explicit messages to girls on the internet and using mobile phones mrs @entity7 said that in the case of 13 - year - old @entity33 , the abuse had tragic consequences after the youngster apparently jumped to her death in despair at being filmed performing a sex act on a boy			1
the mp , who has campaigned for better protections online , said while @entity42 was now ' leading the world ' when it came to making sure internet services providers introduced filters to stop youngsters accessing pornography , the @entity40 warned of children turning to social media to share user - generated content			1
@entity51 was one site , mps heard , where images could be shared and then instantly deleted			2
mrs @entity7 said : ' i do n’t mean to scaremonger but it seems to me that we are conducting a long - term experiment with our children , particularly our girls and young women , in exposing them in such a free way to the sorts of violent , degrading , and often very sexualised content in the online world			1
' this is a huge , growing and endemic problem			1
we have no idea how big the problem is			2
mps were told ' sexting ' can have a devastating effect on young girls @entity72 @entity71 told the @entity18 80 per cent of boys aged 15 - 17 were regularly accessing hardcore pornography ' the @entity40 published some research last year that was quantitative which suggested it was ‘ almost the norm ’ in schools now for children to receive and exchange this sort of information			0
' boys as young as 11 and 12 are sending highly inappropriate photographs of their genitalia around the networks via social media			2
' the mp added : ' fundamentally , this is a behavioural point and what we have to look at is education			1
' there is no technology right now that can protect our children against this sort of thing			0
' @entity72 @entity71 , mp for @entity98 , hit out at fellow mps who read newspapers which ' objectify women ' , telling the @entity18 it was ' offensive '			2
tragedy : this week 's story about 13 - year - old @entity33 ( pictured ) shows how deeply young teens can be affected by sexting dr @entity71 said : ' there ’s nothing new about sexual violence but what has changed is the normalisation and acceptance of sexual violence within our society			0
' she used the newspapers read by fellow mps as an example of how society had been increasingly sexualised			0
she told the @entity18 80 per cent of boys aged 15 - 17 were regularly accessing hardcore pornography			0
' to my mind that constitutes a normalisation , if it ’s being accessed by 80 per cent of young men , ' she said			0
there was also ' the extent to which we see sexting , and the extent to which this is going unchallenged '			0
turning to the reading matter in the @entity18 , she said : ' to give another example , you may say this is a milder version of it , but when i go into the tea room in the @entity136 and i see colleagues having newspapers that i would take as ( having ) images that objectify women , i find that offensive			0
' i find it a normalisation that across the country young girls are sitting in households where they see this as a normal portrayal of women and a sexualisation of women			0

mrs @entity7 added that the abuse can have tragic consequences
