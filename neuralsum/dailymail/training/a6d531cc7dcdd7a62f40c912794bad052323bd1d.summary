and on friday night that wish was granted , after the woman who found mr @entity1 took him to the hospice for a tearful reunion			1
miss @entity24 says she found mr @entity1 running around close to the hospice , according to the examiner			2
but when the pair met in the hospice , it was clear from the wagging tail and mr @entity3 's tears that mr @entity1 had returned			1
an overwhelmed mr @entity3 , who says he has been praying to @entity34 , the patron saint of lost causes , for the safe return of the dog , said : ' i feel like crying , ' as mr @entity1 scampered over him and licked his owner 's face			1
