the apres - ski cocktails start early here in the fashionable @entity3 resort of @entity4			1
in fact , with no skiing whatsoever - and , believe me , i have tried - it 's never too soon to order a gluwein			1
it 's the same up the road in @entity11			1
there , the authorities have just reopened the adventure playground for children			2
but with the @entity24 holiday crowds arriving today , the council is frantically dreaming up new ways to entertain thousands of skiers in a ski resort which is still lacking one vital component : snow			1
over in @entity30 , the famous mountain town at the foot of @entity32 , a handful of ski lifts will finally rumble into life from this morning			1
it will mean there is a limited amount of skiing on some higher slopes for the first time this winter , but everyone acknowledges that it is not enough to cater for the thousands of skiers on their way			2
wherever i have been in the @entity48 this week , the locals tell me that it has been one of the most atrocious starts to a ski season anyone can recall			1
many resorts - including some very famous ones - have had to delay opening by a week or two			1
green and pleasant land : the slopes in @entity11 are a haven of grass - and useless for skiing at the moment others remain closed to all skiers			1
and even in the higher ski areas ( above 2,200 metres ) which are blessed with a rudimentary layer of the white stuff and , in some cases , a glacier , staff are still worried			1
they know they can expect overcrowded slopes and long lift queues as snow - starved punters are bussed in from all those forlorn brown towns further down the valleys			1
nor is there much chance of fleeing the crowds , leaving the beaten track and skiing off - piste			1
in these conditions , that could prove suicidal			2
if ' the big dump ' does not come soon , the high resorts acknowledge they may have to limit numbers on their slopes — or lock out the poor relations			1
this should have been a bumper season for @entity92 skiers , too , with the pound considerably stronger than last year and a new winter @entity95 rail connection to @entity96 four times a week			1
instead , they are glued to the snow reports on the @entity101 's website as they face the prospect of snow rations			2
ask anyone in these nervous communities what they want , and they all have the same message : leave the presents behind , @entity112 , and just bring a @entity114 - sized sack of snow , please			1
even if there is a blizzard tonight , the damage has already been done to bookings for next december			2
memories are short and people will base their plans for 2015 on what happened in 2014 , not all those bumper years which preceded it			2
where do we go from here ? there are occasional patches of snow in @entity11 - but nothing very useful ' bookings are up by 10 per cent on last year but we have had the worst start in 40 years , ' sighs @entity134 at the tourist office in @entity136			1
over in the @entity139 resort of @entity140 , much favoured by @entity142 royalty , just 13 out of 47 lifts are open			0
spokeswoman @entity143 describes this as the worst start to a season since 1999			1
' but then , when the snow finally came , it did n't stop and we were snowed in for two weeks ! ' she adds			0
so how bad is it really ? old hands can recall pretty miserable @entity152 back in the @entity153 and @entity154			0
but the main difference between then and now is that , today , most resorts also have expensive snowmaking cannons to take up the slack			1
yet these are no use unless the temperature is below freezing , and the @entity163 have experienced a prolonged period of unseasonal warm weather			0
other parts of @entity142 are fine			0
the snow is looking good in the @entity168 , for example			0
but it is the @entity163 which are feeling particularly neglected by the snow gods			0
although there have been fresh falls during my stay this week , they have not been followed by a decent cold spell			0
below 2,000 metres , most of this week 's snow was followed by rain , which soon turned it to slush			0
staying hopeful : students @entity182 ( left ) and @entity183 have been in @entity136 for the week my @entity48 odyssey begins in the town of @entity186 , a family - friendly @entity3 town not far from the @entity190 border			1
it is a relatively low - lying ski resort and would never expect a rich carpet of snow at this time of year			1
but when i pass through , i find rolling green fields with the occasional splurge of white where a snow cannon has done its best			0
it looks a bit like the @entity199			0
a spokeswoman for the resort says that ' fingers are crossed ' for snow and that , in the meantime , families can look forward to an exciting series of father christmas - themed events			1
rain is falling by the time i get to @entity11 , another relatively low ski town			1
the tourist office could not be more welcoming			0
@entity212 tells me that the town is doing everything it can , including laying on extra buses to get people up to the higher neighbouring resort of @entity218			0
' we just do n't want to think of @entity24 without snow , ' she says			0
but , for now , all of @entity11 's pistes are closed			1
up by the @entity224 cable car station , however , i notice a small patch of snow , about the size of a tennis court			0
seized by a spirit of solidarity - and so that i can claim to be @entity11 's first skier of the season - i walk to the top , stick on some skis and ' bend ze knees '			1
i must be hitting at least five miles an hour as i grind to a halt in the mud a few seconds later			0
@entity11 is at the heart of one of the world 's largest ski areas , a chunk of @entity242 known as @entity243			1
today , the only skiing in its entire 250 - mile piste network is to be found half an hour away in @entity218			2
visibility is poor , the snow is slushy at the bottom - but it is better than nothing			2
not much to do here , really : @entity18 cuts a forlorn figure as he ponders his next move in @entity4 and the local lift company says it will have up to 40 per cent of @entity218 open this weekend			1
onwards to @entity4 , the ultra-chi - chi resort built by the @entity257 in the @entity258			1
the management had originally intended to start running lifts from december 6			2
then they pushed the date back to december 13 - but still no snow			2
the first cable cars will finally start running today , but only for hill - walkers			1
for now , @entity4 remains off - limits to skiers			1
from a distance , though , it does look as if there is a thin layer of white on the slopes			2
surely , it 's worth a try ? i put on skis and trudge up the hill next to the @entity279 cable car station			0
grass is poking through the porridge veneer			0
in some places , the slush has given way to large puddles			2
i point my skis straight down the hill , squelch forward for a few yards and then stop in my tracks			0
as night falls , we reach the famous @entity291 resort of @entity292 , founded in the @entity293 by a @entity295 officer			0
set high in the vast @entity298 ski area , it is so popular with the @entity92 that we account for 40 per cent of its 1.6 million overnight stays each season			1
@entity302 is falling gently and the outlook appears promising			1
the following day , i sit down with the @entity292 management			0
resort director @entity305 points out that snow depths have always gone in cycles			0
' ten years ago we would get ten metres of snow during a season			2
in the last year or two , it has been five metres over the whole season			2
' @entity313 , managing director of the @entity315 ski lift company , stresses that this was one of the first resorts in the world to install a snow gun in 1985			1
' people said we were crazy , ' he says			0
but now @entity292 has 700 guns covering half of its entire piste network			0
deserted : the ski lifts in @entity11 would ordinarily be abuzz with skiers at this time of the season although they cost £ 25 million , they are certainly paying dividends this winter : this morning , the resort expects to have 70 per cent of its runs open			1
an hour away , i come to @entity136 , a high - rise resort built in the @entity336			2
because of its altitude it has fine , if limited , skiing on the higher pistes			0
@entity92 voices are everywhere today			0
it turns out that more than a thousand @entity92 students are in town			0
' it 's been quite repetitive skiing the same runs all the time , ' says @entity347 , 22 , from @entity348			0
' it 's nothing like previous years , but it 's still good fun			0
' spirits - @entity92 ones , at least - remain high			2
' it 's not ideal , but at least we have skied every day , ' says @entity354 , 53 , a @entity92 engineer based in @entity355			0
' there 's no point coming all the way here and being miserable , ' adds his wife , @entity360 , with a big smile			0
but for the thousands of brits heading to the @entity48 this weekend , there is one possibility even worse than a brown @entity24			0
and that is sitting in the rain out there and reading about a white one back in @entity368 .			0

ski resorts in the @entity3 alps are suffering a terrible start to the season
@entity302 is literally thin on the ground - and , in some places , has not fallen
our reporter visits @entity11 and @entity4 - and finds both out of action
