the @entity1 government on thursday asked an appeals court to lift a temporary hold on president @entity5 's executive action to shield millions of illegal immigrants from deportation , arguing it ca n't wait for the judge who blocked the action to make a ruling on a similar request			1
@entity13 attorneys filed an emergency motion with the 5th @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17 , to lift a preliminary injunction issued last month by @entity1 district judge @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21			1
the injunction had been issued on the request of a coalition of 26 states that filed a lawsuit to overturn @entity5 's immigration plan			1
@entity28 : president @entity5 has responded to a @entity21 judge 's injunction halting his immigration executive actions by demanding an appeals court overrule him here comes the judge : federal jurist @entity19 called the @entity5 administration on the carpet and put the brakes on the president 's immigration plan the states , led by @entity21 , argue that @entity5 's action was unconstitutional and would force them to invest more in law enforcement , health care and education			1
decision time : federal judge @entity46 will likely make the call on whether to overturn @entity19 , her former law school classmate the injunction was intended to stall @entity5 's actions – which would spare from deportation as many as 5 million people who are in the @entity1 illegally – while the lawsuit progresses through the courts			1
many republicans in @entity56 and states led by @entity55 oppose the action , saying @entity5 overstepped his authority as president			2
@entity5 said he had to act because @entity56 has failed to pass comprehensive immigration reform			0
the @entity13 had asked @entity19 to lift the injunction while the case was appealed to the @entity64			2
but @entity19 put that request on hold pending a hearing on march 19 to review allegations the government misled him about the implementation of part of the immigration plan			2
in their 21 - page motion , @entity13 attorneys called the injunction ' unprecedented and wrong ' and argued lifting it was crucial as the order ' irreparably interferes with ( the @entity79 's ) ability to protect the @entity79 and secure our borders			0
' @entity13 attorneys said that if the injunction is not lifted , it should at least apply either only to @entity21 or to the 26 states that sued			2
' president @entity5 's unconstitutional use of executive power to accomplish what he could n't do in @entity56 sets a dangerous precedent that threatens the fabric of our @entity91 , ' @entity21 attorney general @entity84 said in a statement responding to the @entity13 's emergency motion			2
' the state of @entity21 and a bipartisan coalition of 25 other states will continue to oppose the president 's unilateral and lawless actions , ' @entity84 added			0
a coalition of 14 states , including @entity102 and @entity103 , and the @entity104 filed a motion on thursday with the @entity64 in support of lifting the injunction			0
they argued the immigration actions will benefit states through increased tax revenues and improved public safety			0
but @entity21 has on its side a longer list : @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity17 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138			0
legal experts say the @entity64 is known to be fairly conservative , and is likely to deny the @entity13 's request			0
ultimately , it could end up before the @entity1 @entity142			0
plaintiff : @entity21 gov. @entity144 is spearheading the lawsuit along with 25 other governors @entity147 : conservatives have bristled at the idea of the @entity150 tossing border security overboard in favor of letting 5 million or more illegal immigrants stay at next week 's hearing , @entity19 was set to have @entity13 attorneys explain why the federal government granted three - year deportation reprieves as well as work permits to 100,000 individuals before @entity19 's feb. 16 injunction			1
attorneys had previously said federal officials would n't accept such requests until feb. 18			0
the @entity13 has said the reprieves and work permits were granted under the 2012 @entity166 program , known as @entity166 , which was not halted by @entity19 's injunction			1
@entity166 protects young immigrants from deportation if they were brought to the @entity1 illegally as children			0
in a separate court document filed with @entity19 's court on thursday , the @entity13 said the acknowledgement that some individuals were granted reprieves under 2012 @entity166 guidelines does ' not bear on the resolution ' of the pending request before the judge to lift the injunction			1
@entity19 's injunction put on the hold an expansion of @entity166 as well as a program that would extend deportation protections to parents of @entity1 citizens and permanent residents who have been in the country for some years .			1

26 states sued in federal court and *won* a temporary injunction preventing the @entity150 from *mainstreaming* more than 5 million illegal immigrants
judge @entity19 put on the brakes , saying the *policy* could cause harms that it would be *impossible* to undo
now the @entity5 administration is going over @entity19 's head to the 5th @entity15 , demanding it overturn @entity19
@entity5 wants to give @entity203 numbers , green cards and work permits to some who are in the country illegally , and guarantee them they wo n't be deported for at least two years
