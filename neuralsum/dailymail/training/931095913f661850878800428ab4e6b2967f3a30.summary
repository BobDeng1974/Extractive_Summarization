by @entity0 , science correspondent published : 14:31 est , 10 november 2013 @entity2 : 05:57 est , 11 november 2013 under pressure : higher oestrogen levels helped women multitask under pressure , according to phd student @entity7 taking @entity9 could help prevent older women from suffering embarrassing ‘ senior moments ’			1
levels of the hormone oestrogen plummet around the menopause , but a study suggests that replacing it helps keep the mind sharp when under pressure			2
women with high levels of oestrogen did as well on a memory test when stressed out as when relaxed , but others were forgetful when pressurised			1
the @entity25 study tested 42 post-menopausal women , half of whom had been taking @entity9 for about five years , on their working memory			1
this is the type of memory we use to hold one thing in mind while doing something else – for instance , remembering a phone number while asking someone for a pen and paper			0
to put the body under stress , the women held their hands in a bucket of icy water for three minutes			1
they then did a test of working memory in which they had to remember lists of words while reading sentences and checking them for grammatical errors			0
the test was also done in more relaxed circumstances , in which the bucket was filled with pleasantly warm water			0
women with low levels of oestrogen did much worse on the memory test when their hands were cold			1
however , those with high levels of the hormone did n’t falter , the @entity62 ’s annual conference heard			1
saliva samples showed that levels of the stress hormone cortisol shot up in the women with low oestrogen – but only rose slightly in those with large amounts of the sex hormone			1
researcher @entity7 said her findings suggest oestrogen helps protect the brain from the effects of stress			2
the fall in oestrogen that occurs with age means that older women lose this ‘ built - in protection ’			2
the study was carried out on 42 post-menopausal women , half of which were taking @entity9 miss @entity86 , a phd student : ‘ if you are taking oestrogen after menopause , you may have some kind of protection from the effects of stress on memory			1
‘ it may be as simple as higher oestrogen reduces the amount of cortisol released and so there is less of the stress hormone around to affect memory processing			2
’ she stressed that health concerns surrounding @entity9 mean any women considering starting it should discuss the issue carefully with their doctor			2
the drug is very effective at easing the symptoms of menopause and can cut the odds of brittle bones and bowel cancer , according to the @entity116			0
it warns that @entity9 slightly increases the risk of stroke , breast cancer and ovarian cancer and cancer of the lining of the womb but says that if taken for under five years , most experts agree that the benefits outweigh the risks			0
miss @entity7 added that controlling stress may have benefits beyond improved memory			0
‘ stress , whether at home or at work , can have negative effects on the body and brain , hurting and killing brain cells and producing problems with mood , memory and sleep , ' she said			0
‘ women who are going through the menopause or post-menopause are still working and raising families and these are stressful daily life events			0
‘ discovering factors that might protect people from stress could have huge impacts on how people perform in their daily lives from work , to relationships at home			0
