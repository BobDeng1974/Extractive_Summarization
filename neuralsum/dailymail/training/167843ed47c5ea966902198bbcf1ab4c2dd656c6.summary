by @entity0 published : 21:42 est , 19 june 2013 updated : 07:02 est , 20 june 2013 when three families moved to a remote yet picturesque village in the @entity6 countryside several years ago , they thought they had found the quiet , simple life they craved			1
the families , one of them @entity9 , had fallen in love with @entity11 , a tiny farming community , close to @entity13 in central @entity6 , and decided to set up home in yurts - accommodation usually favoured by the nomadic people of the @entity18 steppes			1
but their peace has since been shattered after the families became embroiled in a bitter legal row with the mayor of the village who took exception to their unusual choice of home			1
@entity48 , a @entity6 who has a yurt on land he owns with his partner , has described the mayor 's crusade as ' social cleansing and administrative harassment ' according to @entity56			1
the @entity9 family at the centre of the row , antiques dealer and artist @entity61 , 44 , his partner @entity27 and their children @entity28 , 14 , and @entity60 , 10 , moved to the area after they stumbled across it while heading home from a tour of the country eight years ago			2
they set up home in a field , with its owners consent and the two children attended the local school			1
the family were happy in their quaint surroundings until 2007 when the local council chose to map out plots of land where new buildings could be erected			2
unusual choice of home : three families who set up home in yurts in the small community of @entity35 , @entity6 , have become embroiled in a legal battle with the local mayor who takes exception to their choice of accommodation comfortable : the yurt has a wooden floor and wooden doors and windows and is made of a wooden frame covered in material the family could only stay on the land if the council decided that either the yurt constituted a tent - it is made of a wooden floor , wooden doors and windows and surrounded by a wooden lattice frame covered in material - or that the land was declared ' a new building zone '			1
but the mayor said that according to law the yurt constitutes a dwelling more akin to a bungalow than a tent			0
he claims it would have cost the town £ 34,000 to keep the yurts as the local authority would have been obliged to hook them up to the water and electricity supply			2
he refused to allow the families to be included on the electoral role the following year , and the inhabitants claim that he denied one of their children access to the local school			2
on a mission : mayor @entity44 - @entity128 , pictured in front of the town hall , says that he is only adhering to planning regulations although the situation was temporarily calmed when the region 's deputy government prefect promised that the yurtists would be accomadated , trouble flared again in 2010 when the mayor posted a decree banning ' wild camping '			0
a disgruntled mr @entity43 took legal action the following year when he was hit in the face with a pie during a television documentary on the row			0
the yurtists appeared to finally have won the long - running dispute late last year when a court ruled that their yurts are tents and they could stay on the land			0
but the prosecutor appealed the verdict and has now called for fines and orders for the families to leave the land within three months			0
according to @entity56 , mayor @entity43 said : ' they ’re in a region where outsiders are already looked at askance , so you have to make a big effort to be accepted			0
' but they think it ’s up to us to adapt			0
