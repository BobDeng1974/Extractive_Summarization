by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 03:34 est , 30 may 2012 updated : 08:52 est , 30 may 2012 facing extradition : @entity3 is now a step closer to being forced out of @entity5 after the @entity7 decision to uphold previous rulings @entity9 founder @entity3 today lost his @entity7 fight against extradition to @entity12 to face sex crime allegations			1
lawyers for @entity3 asked @entity5 's highest court to block his removal , arguing that the @entity18 arrest warrant issued against him was ' invalid and unenforceable '			1
the @entity7 judges , who heard the case in february , today announced that they have rejected his challenge			2
the court dismissed his appeal by a majority of five to two			2
@entity3 , who was not present for the hearing because his lawyers said he was stuck in traffic , was given 14 days to consider today 's ruling before a final decision on his next step in his legal battle			1
his team indicated they would reopen the case at the @entity7			1
today lord @entity35 , president of the court , said the point of law which had to be considered had not been simple to resolve			0
the @entity12 authorities want @entity3 , 40 , to answer accusations of raping one woman and sexually molesting and coercing another in @entity42 in august 2010 while on a visit to give a lecture			1
@entity3 , whose @entity9 website has published a mass of leaked diplomatic cables that embarrassed several governments and international businesses , says the sex was consensual and the allegations against him are politically motivated			1
in november 2011 , the @entity52 upheld a ruling by district judge @entity54 - who sat at @entity55 , south @entity56 , in february 2011 - that the @entity58 computer expert should be extradited to face investigation			2
the only celebrity to show up was journalist @entity65 , standing behind her the @entity52 declared that it would not be unfair or unlawful to extradite @entity3			1
the case has become a cause celebre and has hearings have previously been attended by celebrities such as @entity70 , film director @entity71 and former labour minister @entity72			1
@entity3 burst into the public consciousness in april 2010 when @entity9 released collateral murder - video footage of a @entity76 air crew shooting @entity78 civilians in 2007			2
the whistleblower website , which claimed a database of 1.2 million documents within a year of its 2006 launch , regularly hit the headlines in 2010 with a series of leaks			2
the @entity76 @entity88 cables , @entity90 war logs and iraq war logs , which were drip - fed to the media in 2010 , helped raise the profile of @entity3			2
last year revealed that the site is at risk of closure and is suspending its publishing operations to concentrate on fighting a financial blockade and raising new funds			0
the stricken website is running on cash reserves after an ' arbitrary and unlawful financial blockade ' was imposed by @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 last december , said @entity3			2
but as the fortunes of @entity9 have waned - including criticism by newspapers such as the @entity112 who were given initial access to the diplomatic cables - fewer high - profile people are willing to back @entity3			0
the only well - known face to show up today was left - wing journalist @entity65			0
during the appeal hearing in february , @entity3 's @entity118 argued before @entity35 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 that the @entity12 public prosecutor who signed the arrest warrant could not issue a valid document because she lacked impartiality and independence			1
ms @entity131 said his latest appeal raised the single issue of law as to whether the @entity12 public prosecutor constituted a ‘ judicial authority ’ capable of issuing a valid warrant under the provisions of the @entity138			1
it was common ground that if she did not , there was no legal basis for extradition			0
ms @entity118 suggested it was obvious that a public prosecutor whose function it was to investigate and prosecute an individual ‘ can not exercise judicial authority in relation to that individual ’			0
as a matter of fundamental legal principle dating back hundreds of years , a judicial authority had to be impartial and independent both of the executive and the parties in a case			0
@entity158 , for the @entity157 , argued that the @entity52 was plainly correct to accept that the term ‘ judicial authority ’ had a wide and autonomous meaning , and it was not restricted in the way described by ms @entity118			0
since the start of the @entity18 arrest warrant ( @entity167 ) scheme , it had been the practice of a number of prominent member states to issue @entity171 through public prosecutors			1
backing : supporters of @entity3 hold a vigil for him in @entity175 , @entity58 , today while the @entity7 in @entity56 announced its verdict protest : @entity177 , six , participates in a vigil for @entity3 in @entity175 , @entity58 today ms @entity179 argued : ‘ there is no conceivable breach of fundamental rights involved in such a process			1
’ in the majority ruling today , in which @entity121 and @entity123 dissented , the court held that an @entity167 issued by a public prosecutor is a valid warrant issued by a judicial authority within the meaning of the @entity191			0
afterwards , ms @entity118 said an application would be made to reopen the case at the @entity7 on the basis that the court 's majority decision was made on legal points not argued during the appeal			1
the representative for the two women , lawyer @entity200 , told @entity12 newspaper @entity202 that the outcome was expected , but ‘ strongly criticised ’ the @entity204 for the amount of time the extradition order has taken			0
absent : @entity70 and film director @entity71 , who both began showing up to one of @entity3 's court hearings in december 2012 and each offered £ 20,000 to assure his bail , were not present at court today wanted : details of @entity213 's arrest warrant are provided on its website			1
he is wanted by police in @entity12 ‘ i find it hard to understand why it has taken so long , they ’ve had it on their desks since autumn 2010			2
it has of course gone through all the correct departments , but it has still taken a long time			0
’ ‘ i strongly criticise it , it has had a completely unnecessary impact on my clients			0
’ he said that he has not been able to speak to his clients yet but that he expects them to be relieved			0
‘ even though a trial is a very strenuous procedure it has always been their wish that he should be forced to take responsibility for his actions			0
anything else would be disgraceful			0

@entity5 's highest court rules @entity12 prosecutors did have right to issue arrest warrant despite his lawyers ' complaint that it was ' invalid '
@entity3 , who has already had bids to stay in @entity5 dismissed by district court and @entity52 , now plans to reopen case with @entity7
@entity3 , who claims accusations against are politically motivated following a series of embarrassing leaks , missed the hearing after getting stuck in traffic
no sign of celebrity backers @entity70 , @entity71 or @entity72
he faces allegations that he raped one woman and sexually molesting another while visiting @entity42 in august 2010 to give a lecture
