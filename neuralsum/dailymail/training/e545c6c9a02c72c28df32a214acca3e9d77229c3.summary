mr @entity0 , who was appointed by the @entity33 to scrutinise all counter-terrorism legislation , said of the prime minister ’s original plan : ‘ i sense that this was an announcement waiting for a policy			1
’ he told a committee of mps and peers he believed it had soon become clear that such a move would ‘ neither legally nor practically ’ work and the plan was now for a system of ‘ managed return ’			1
