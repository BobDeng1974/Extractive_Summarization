@entity0 have decided to listen to offers for @entity2 and @entity3 this summer as the @entity5 champions look to repair the damage of a disastrous title defence			1
city manager @entity8 is under intense scrutiny following sunday ’s 4 - 2 defeat by neighbours @entity11			1
but as the @entity0 board refuse to give up on their manager just yet the decision has been made to jettison high - profile players who the club believe have failed them			2
@entity0 have decided to listen to offers for @entity17 midfielder @entity2 this summer the @entity5 champions are also open to allowing @entity3 leave the @entity19 @entity2 will be made available before his value in the market dwindles			1
@entity3 , meanwhile , has barely played since his lame showing in the @entity23 at @entity24			0
defender @entity25 and striker @entity26 are also short of admirers within the club , while midfielder @entity29 is out of contract this summer			0
@entity2 may be difficult to sell as he earns in excess of £ 1million a month			0
@entity8 is vulnerable but may be saved by a relatively undemanding fixture list up to the end of the season and by the fact that @entity0 ’s @entity37 choice to replace him , @entity39 , is contracted to @entity40 for another year			0
however , @entity0 fear captain @entity41 will miss a few weeks of the run - in with a thigh injury .			2

@entity0 were *beaten* 4 - 2 by their *rivals* *united* at @entity46
the defending @entity5 champions will listen to offers for stars
@entity2 and @entity3 are allowed to leave the @entity19 this summer
