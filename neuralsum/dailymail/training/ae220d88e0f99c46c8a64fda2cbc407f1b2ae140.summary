think of a jetpack and you may imagine flying over a futuristic city , inspired by scenes in sci - fi films			2
but the technology could also be used to enable soldiers to run faster in warzones in a matter of years			1
@entity10 engineers have created a working prototype that attaches to people 's backs and helps them to run a mile in a much shorter space of time – despite carrying the large metal pack			1
the project is the military 's latest effort to create exoskeletons for @entity10 soldiers to give them super-human strength , speed and other advantages on the battlefield			1
@entity41 , an engineering student at the university explained : ‘ we reduced the amount of force so we ’re not able to fly with our jet pack but we have instantaneous thrust and can trigger it to allow for faster movements			2
’ he and his mentor are working with the @entity50 ( @entity50 ) to develop the idea for military purposes			2
the goal behind @entity34 ’s @entity33 ( four minute mile ) project is to enhance the speed and agility of the wearer of a jetpack so they can run a four minute mile with ease			1
in 200 metre trials , runners decreased their times and used less energy , the experts said			0
the equipment they have developed is pictured ‘ our goal is to get any soldier – or subject wearing the jetpack – to be able to run a four minute mile , who was not capable of doing so before , ’ he said			1
when mr @entity41 and his mentor professor @entity73 were first asked by @entity50 to design a way to allow soldier to run faster without using any more effort , they experimented with a system allowing a person to be pulled along , but quickly settled on a jetpack for propulsion			1
currently , a volunteer wearing the pack can shave seconds off their best time – despite carrying the 11lbs ( 5kg ) metal pack			0
in one test , a runner was able to reduce their personal best for a mile from five minutes 20 seconds , to five minutes and two seconds			0
in 200 metre trials , runners decreased their times and used less energy , the experts said			0
mr @entity41 said : ‘ in the warfare arena this [ the ability to run faster ] could be the difference between life and death			1
’ ‘ devices can help soldiers succeed in their missions and potentially save human lives			1
’ mr @entity41 said : ‘ in the warfare arena this [ the ability to run faster ] could be the difference between life and death			1
’ here , a soldier from the @entity107 runs across open ground to avoid sniper fire in @entity110 the @entity10 @entity111 has called on scientists to develop a suit reminiscent of the one seen in the films like @entity115 ( pictured ) the @entity116 ( @entity117 ) would effectively give its wearer superpowers , such as the ability to see in the dark , super-human strength and a way of deflecting bullets , but its is a work in progress			2
the @entity10 @entity111 ( @entity111 ) has called on scientists to develop a suit reminiscent of the one seen in the films that uses nanotechnology			0
such a suit would probably build upon work done by an @entity131 professor who is developing ' liquid armour ' , which captured the imagination of @entity10 armed forces scientists who are looking for a way of protecting their troops from intensive combat situations in @entity138 and @entity110			0
at a conference in may 2013 , @entity140 admiral @entity139 challenged scientists to build a suit that would function as a ' practical exoskeleton ' and protect soldiers from shrapnel and bullets using @entity148 and nanotechnology			0
he said that the suit should be light enough for soldiers to wear in battle but also suitable for surveillance missions and the idea has captured people 's imaginations - as seen in the animated video below			2
once fully developed , the armour could transform from a more liquid form to a solid in a fraction of a second under the influence of a magnetic field or electric current as well as being able to monitor a soldier 's heart rate , hydration levels and core temperature , @entity157 reported			1
it is thought a suit would respond to the data , supplied by an on - board computer hooked up to sensors , to keep a soldier in the best conditions for battle			0
@entity111 has asked academics , entrepreneurs and private laboratories to submit white papers detailing how its @entity117 suit could be built and how they could help make their designs a reality , while other reports suggest that @entity186 could be utilised to provide soldiers with information on the battle field			0
@entity190 to give people super-human strength and night vision already exist , but the challenge is building the technology into a lightweight suit .			0

engineers from @entity34 have created a working prototype jetpack that attaches to a soldier 's back and helps them run faster
the @entity33 project 's aim is to enhance the speed and agility of the wearer of a jetpack so they can run a four minute mile with ease
*inventors* say their packs could help soldiers escape *dangerous* situations on the battlefield and potentially save their lives , giving them more energy
project comes at the *request* of the @entity50 ( @entity50 ) , which has also called for exoskeletons for the battlefield
