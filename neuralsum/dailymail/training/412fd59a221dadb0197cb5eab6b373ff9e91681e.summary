hosts @entity0 pulled off one of the shocks of the tournament to reach the quarter finals of the @entity5			1
the @entity9 , as the @entity8 - @entity7 side are known , stunned @entity10 thanks to a penalty from @entity12 and a late second from @entity14 to put their neighbours out of the competition			1
@entity12 scored from the spot to convert a penalty he won himself , having pulled off a lovely step over before bursting into the box where he was tripped by @entity23			1
@entity0 midfielder @entity12 scores from the penalty spot against @entity10 @entity12 celebrates after giving the hosts the lead in the 55th minute in @entity27 @entity12 is mobbed by his team - mates and substitutes after giving his country a vital advantage @entity10 : @entity32 ; @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 ; @entity37 , @entity38 ( @entity39 69 ) , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 subs not used : @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 booked : @entity54 @entity0 : @entity32 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 ( @entity14 68 mins ) , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 ( @entity64 76 ) , @entity12 subs not used : @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 goals : @entity12 , @entity14 the former @entity76 striker stepped up to take it himself , and dispatched it brilliantly to send the @entity27 crowd into delirium			1
the winger could have made it two fourteen minutes from time , but after being brilliantly slid through on he fired his shot to close to @entity83 , who saved with his legs			0
however it was n’t to prove costly , as @entity14 rounded off a counter-attack in the 86th minute to secure the victory			1
it continues the remarkable statistic that no host nation has failed to get out of the group stages of this tournament since 1994 , but few have had so many factors against them in the build - up			0
disqualified for fielding an ineligible player seven months ago , @entity0 only found out they were playing again when they took over from @entity99 as hosts in november			2
they then changed manager in january , current boss @entity103 only stepping across from the women ’s national team two weeks before the tournament began			0
but , against all the odds , their team , which includes part - timers from the domestic league , showed incredible spirit to hold on against a @entity10 side that post players from all around @entity115 ’s top teams			2
the hosts had their goalkeeper to thank for the clean sheet that saw them into the last eight			0
@entity121 ( not to be confused with @entity10 ’s stopper @entity83 ) was up to the test in the first half , saving well from both a powerful @entity126 header and then from a stinging @entity128 drive in the first half			0
@entity0 's @entity14 celebrates after sealing his country 's place in the last eight with a late goal @entity0 's players sprint off the bench to celebrating reach the quarter - finals of the competition local fans go wild at the final whistle as the hosts continue to progress at the @entity5 his best stops came in the minutes immediately after half time , when he acrobatically pushed a brilliant @entity42 free kick over the bar , before denying @entity41 from a similar free kick with another excellent save			1
@entity0 came into the game knowing that despite two creditable draws in their first two games , they would have to beat @entity10 to go through , whatever the result in the group ’s other game between @entity154 and the disappointing @entity155			1
perhaps unsurprisingly @entity10 , ranked 56 places above their hosts in the @entity158 , were the better side for much of the game , dominating possession and the early chances			2
with @entity163 ’s @entity162 and @entity164 ’s @entity41 either side of the dangerous @entity166 a threat going forward			0
but the hosts did create a few opportunities of their own , with @entity170 ’s @entity62 , scorer of his country ’s only previous goal this tournament , a threat in behind			0
twice he almost found striker @entity63 with a clever ball across the box , only for the @entity10 defence to clear at the last moment			0
@entity0 's @entity179 ( right ) tussles for the ball with @entity10 's @entity182 goalkeeper @entity121 dives to stop the ball reaching @entity10 striker @entity184 ( centre ) and soon after @entity0 had taken the lead @entity62 forced a save from @entity83 on the counter-attack , but the hosts seemed content to sit back and await the @entity10 onslaught once they had their all - important lead			1
there were nervous moments – @entity41 had a cross deflected just over the bar , and moments later the @entity164 man fired over the bar from 8 yards out with the goal unguarded			0
but , remarkably , it was the hosts who looked the more likely to score when they picked off their opponents on the break , as @entity10 struggled to shine in the most electric of atmospheres			2
and with four minutes remaining one such counter produced the goal that sealed it , @entity62 ’s shot parried into the path of @entity14 , who scuffed it home			1
in the end @entity154 ’s win , thanks in part to a goal from former @entity215 forward @entity216 , meant that they will move away from their fortress in @entity27 – where they remain unbeaten – to play their quarter - final in @entity221 , a tiny town in the north - east of the country			2
but , on sunday night in the tiny west @entity226 state , that was never going to put a damper on the wild celebrations .			0

@entity12 scored from the penalty spot to give the hosts a 1 - 0 lead
@entity14 sealed victory with just a few minutes remaining in @entity27
@entity0 have reached last eight but @entity10 are out
