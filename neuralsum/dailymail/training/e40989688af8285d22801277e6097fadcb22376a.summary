. ’ the raucous wedding crowd yelled : ‘ not sunday : tomorrow ! saturday ! ’ @entity9 blushed before raising his glass and continuing : ‘ to @entity10 … you changed my life in a way i never knew was possible			1
’ the following day it fell to his uncle @entity48 to toast the couple following the evening ceremony in @entity26 ’s tiny wood - frame church			2
