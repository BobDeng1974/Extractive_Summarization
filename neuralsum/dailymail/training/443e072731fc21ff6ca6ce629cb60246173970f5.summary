by @entity0 @entity1 : 14:42 est , 12 december 2013 @entity2 : 10:54 est , 13 december 2013 @entity3 has unveiled its entry for this year ’s @entity5 and it ’s a 6ft 2in so - called ‘ superhero ’ robot called @entity7			1
valkyrie can walk by itself , pick up objects and even use tools - and one day the advanced machine could be used to save lives in war or disaster zones			0
the humanoid has been designed with female characteristics and its various built - in cameras , recording and sonar equipment are powered by a 2kwh battery			1
@entity7 , pictured , was built at @entity3 's @entity22 in @entity23			1
it has been designed with female characteristics and runs on a 2kwh battery			1
it is one of 17 entries taking part in the @entity5 trials that awards $ 2million to the best design the @entity33 is run by the @entity34			1
all entrants are put through a series of scenarios the robots might encounter in extreme situations , such as driving a vehicle , cleaning debris and cutting through a wall			0
teams are encouraged to develop a robot that ' could work with humans at disaster sites , capable of operating in a range of disarray and hazards and will allow relief agencies to reduce the danger to disaster victims and first responders alike			0
' winners are awarded a $ 2million grant to help develop the technology further and is an initiative run by the @entity34 in the @entity58 it is called an automaton because it can carry out tasks autonomously			1
it was designed and built in nine months by a team of engineers at @entity3 's @entity66 ( @entity66 ) in @entity67 , @entity23			1
@entity68 , project leader of the @entity69 told @entity70 : ‘ we really wanted to design the appearance of this robot to be one that when you saw it you ’d say ‘ wow , that ’s awesome ’			2
‘ if you brush against it while you ’re working , you do n’t want to feel this cold , hard metal			0
you want it to feel natural , like you ’re working next to another human being			0
’ @entity3 is hoping the life - sized robot will be used in future humanitarian and space missions and it will be put to the test during the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) trials later this month			1
the challenge puts all entrants through a series of scenarios they might encounter in extreme situations , such as driving a vehicle , cleaning debris and cutting through a wall			0
another entry from @entity3 , this time from the @entity95 , is @entity96 , pictured			2
it is a bidepal robot that weighs 17 stone			2
it has four limbs and hands that are said to be for both ' mobility and manipulation ' and can support ladders , railings and stair treads teams are encouraged to develop a robot that ‘ could work with humans at disaster sites , capable of operating in a range of disarray and hazards and will allow relief agencies to reduce the danger to disaster victims and first responders alike			0
‘ winners are awarded a $ 2million grant to help develop the technology further and the challenge is an initiative run by the @entity34 in the @entity58 other robots being entered into the competition include @entity124 built by @entity125 - a group of engineers from @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129			1
@entity130 has developed the @entity131 ( @entity132 ) which is the heaviest of the entrants , weighing 28 stone , left			1
the bipedal robot @entity137 , built by the @entity140 - owned @entity139 robotics firm , right , is small compared to the competition , weighing just 15 stone and standing at 4ft 10in it is named after @entity144 , the patron saint of firefighters and weighs 23 stone			1
another is @entity137 , a bipedal robot built by the @entity139 robotics firm recently bought by @entity140			1
it is small compared to the competition , weighing just 15 stone and standing at 4ft 10in			0
@entity130 has developed @entity131 ( @entity132 ) , which is one of the heaviest of the entrants , weighing 28 stone			1
it rolls on rubberised tracks to drive like a tank and uses 360 - degree sensors to build a model of its environment to provide better situational awareness for a remote operator			0
@entity163 , by @entity164 from @entity165 , pictured , has a hexapod design that can travel over uneven terrain and be used to support ladders , similar to @entity3 's @entity96 @entity124 , pictured left , was built by @entity125 - a group of engineers from @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129			2
it is named after @entity144 , the patron saint of firefighters and weighs 23 stone			0
the @entity175 from @entity176 , right , weighs just 8 stone and is 5ft 1in tall			2
it was built and assembled in @entity179 @entity180 ( @entity180 ) designed by @entity181 is one of the lightest robots , weighing just 10 stone			2
according to the designers , @entity180 has three essential themes : ‘ hardware resilience , robust autonomy and intuitive operation ’			0
it stands at 5ft 10in			0
while the @entity190 from @entity191 weighs just 8 stone and is 5ft 1in tall			2
another entry from @entity3 , this time from the @entity95 , is @entity96 - a bidepal robot that weighs 17 stone			1
it has four limbs and hands that are said to be for both ‘ mobility and manipulation ’ and can support ladders , railings and stair treads			0
a total of 17 teams from around the world will bring their respective droids to trials at @entity209 ’s @entity208 the weekend of 20 and 21 december			0
the finals will then take place by @entity212 .			0

valkyrie , built by @entity3 , is 6ft 2in tall and weighs almost 20 stone
