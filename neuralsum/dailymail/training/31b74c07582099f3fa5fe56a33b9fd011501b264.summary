by @entity0 for @entity1 some people will do anything for charity , even if it means stripping naked in freezing temperatures atop @entity7 's highest peak			1
that 's exactly what cheeky @entity9 did when he reached the summit of @entity12 after enduring treacherous conditions during a nine - day charity climb			1
the 18 - year - old student scaled the 19,341 - ft high mountain wearing full walking gear , including four layers of thermals , and then bared all for pictures after a friend bet him just 18 pence to streak at the peak in -12c weather			1
he posed for 10 minutes in just his walking boots , bringing some life to the dormant volcanic mountain			2
4 the teen from @entity42 , @entity43 , said : ' everyone at the summit loved it and everyone was taking pictures of me and i had a bit of an audience			2
' my parents were shocked at first but people seem to have donated more because of it , which is great			0
' i would do it again at other landmarks			0
i want to go to @entity32 next so maybe i will strip there too			0
' on top of the world : @entity9 and a seven other climbers trekked an average of almost six miles a day he got the idea from a fellow @entity31 volunteer , who snaps a picture of himself naked at every landmark he visits			1
@entity9 said : ' once i was with the climb group i mentioned it in conversation and it just snowballed after that			2
' everyone kept talking about it and one climber bet me 500 @entity77 shillings , which is about 18p , that i would n't do it			0
' when we got to the top i had to do it so just thought why not , it was a once in a lifetime opportunity			0
' the temperature was between -10c and -12c when @entity9 decided to streak on the mountain 's peak take it off : people have donated hundreds of pounds since @entity9 posted the snaps on @entity37 he added : ' it was between -10c and -12c but it did n't feel that cold , probably because of the adrenaline and we had just walked for six hours so i was already warm			1
' @entity9 scaled the mountain with seven other climbers after he spent four weeks volunteering at a hospital in @entity98 , @entity77			1
they trekked an average of almost six miles a day with a team of 31 porters			0
he said : ' the summit climb was the hardest part but walking for nine days in a row was challenging			0
' some days we would do a short three hour trek and an hour trek to acclimatise and other treks would be eight hours			0
' breath - taking views : climbers can see for miles when they reach the summit of @entity12 he did it all to raise money for @entity31 and awareness of the ' fantastic ' work that they do			1
' i do voluntary work every week at @entity31 in @entity35 so have seen the amazing work they do caring for terminally ill children first hand and everybody has a massive smile on their face most of the time			2
' now that the climb is over , @entity9 is taking a gap year and hopes to study medicine at a university abroad before training to become a doctor			1
he recently finished his a-levels at @entity137 in @entity138 , where he got an a in chemistry , an a in human biology and a b in maths with statistics .			0
