by @entity1 reporter people born blind have more accurate memories than those with sight , scientists say			1
those with no visual experience at all had the best verbal and memory skills in tests			0
researchers compared those born blind , others with late onset blindness and sighted people			1
participants listened to a series of words and was then asked to recall what they had heard			0
skills test : researchers have found that blind people have better memories than those with sight the results showed that congenitally blind people remembered more words			1
they were also less likely to create false memories of what they had heard			1
research has shown we often recall words related to those we actually hear			2
for example , hearing the words chimney , cigar and fire could trigger a false memory of the word smoke			2
dr @entity39 , who led the study for the @entity41 , said : ' we found that congenitally blind participants reported significantly more correct words than both late - onset blind and sighted people			1
' most of the congenitally blind participants avoided unrelated words , therefore congenitally blind participants can store more items and with a higher fidelity			0
' results : ' visual experience has a significant negative impact on accuracy of semantic memory ' fellow researcher dr @entity54 said : ' our results show that visual experience has a significant negative impact on both the number of items remembered and the accuracy of semantic memory and also demonstrate the importance of adaptive neural plasticity in the congenitally blind brain for enhanced memory retrieval mechanisms			0
' there is an old @entity68 proverb that believes the blind were the most trustworthy sources for quotations and that certainly seems true in this case			0
' it will be interesting to see whether congenitally blind individuals would also be better witnesses in forensic studies			0
' the @entity41 team worked in collaboration with a research assistant from @entity79			0
sighted and late blind participants remembered fewer words that were said , and more that were not			1
distortions and illusions within human memory are well documented in scientific and forensic work and appear to be a basic feature of memory functioning			0
several studies previously suggested that blind people - especially those with no visual experience - possess superior verbal and memory skills			2
congenital blindness improves semantic and episodic memory is published in the journal @entity97 .			1

@entity97 compared those born blind and others with late onset blindness
*university* *academics* also compared them with memories of sighted people
sighted people more likely to create a false memories of what they hear
