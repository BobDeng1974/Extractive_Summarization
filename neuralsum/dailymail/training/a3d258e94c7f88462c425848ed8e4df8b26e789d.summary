' he is not clinically depressed or a shut - in or a recluse , ' he declared			1

furthermore , @entity1 was reportedly close with actress @entity43 , who died from complications of routine throat surgery in september , yet did not attend her funeral			1
one friend , who did not wish to be named , told the celebrity news site : ' there is no way he would n't have gone to her funeral if he was ok			0
' @entity1 has also apparently abandoned his exercise studio , where he was regularly a fixture , and has failed to contact friends and family to inform them he is well			1
' if @entity1 is really ok and is aware people are extremely concerned about him , he 'd pick up the phone and tell them to relax			1
but he has n't , and we 're worried sick , ' the friend said			0

' [ but ] he is not clinically depressed or a shut - in or a recluse			1
[ @entity20 ] passed away a year and a half ago , it ’s not the issue			0
and he has n’t lost weight recently either			0
' @entity1 's housekeeper also denied claims that the star is suffering from ' debilitating depression ' , saying he is ' perfectly fine '			1
speaking to @entity73 , the housekeeper , named @entity124 , who is allegedly tasked with turning friends or associates away when they come to visit him , said : ' he 's home and he 's fine			1

in a post on his official @entity104 page he said : ' i am so touched by the outpouring of love and concern that i have received today			0

the eccentric entertainer has n't been seen in public for almost a year @entity157 , who lives directly opposite , tells @entity73 exclusively that @entity1 ' housekeeper is adamant the sparkling fitness fanatic is merely ' resting '			1
mr @entity157 confirmed that @entity1 had issues with his knee but believes he 's doing well and is most likely to be working on something new , he understands from many conversations with the gym guru 's staff			2
mr @entity157 explained : ' i think he 's working on a new project , he 's constantly recreating himself because the man has so much energy			0
he 's a wonderful neighbor to have			0
' since his 80s heyday @entity1 has constantly sought to regain his faded fame , and can be easily recognized in @entity75 by his bushy hair ' he told me about a knee problem months ago but i 've not seen him since so i do n't know of any updates with it , ' mr @entity157 explained			2
one concerned neighbor pulled over their vehicle to ask @entity73 if the dazzling star had died , such is his absence in the community			2

friends of fitness guru @entity1 claim 66 - year - old is ' not ok '
their last contact with star was march 10 and he has not phoned them
he also failed to attend funeral of @entity43 , whom he was ' close to '
' if @entity1 is really ok , he would pick up the phone and tell us to relax '
comes days after @entity1 's spokesman denied star is *hidden* away
@entity7 said : ' he 's not clinically depressed , a shut - in or recluse '
@entity1 's housekeeper told @entity73 he is ' perfectly fine ' at home
contradicts claims @entity1 is upset over knee injury and dog 's death
