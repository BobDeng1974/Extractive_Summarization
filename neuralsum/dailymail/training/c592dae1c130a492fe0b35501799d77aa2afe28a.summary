by @entity0 published : 17:47 est , 10 june 2013 updated : 05:37 est , 11 june 2013 strawberries and cream ... bread and butter ... tea and biscuits ... some things just go together			2
but cheese and compression bandages ? yoghurt and head torches ? not so much			0
of course , this has n’t deterred staff at the @entity15 - on - @entity16 branch of @entity17 from displaying them proudly , side - by - side			1
it ’s fair to say the shop ’s displays do n’t make much sense — but then there ’s not much about the @entity26 discount supermarket that does			0
new territory : @entity0 does her grocery shop at her local @entity29			1
this week , she went to her nearest branch of @entity17 to see what all the fuss is about from the bizarre items they stock ( ‘ would you like a bicycle saddle with your baguette , madam ? ’ ) to the chaotic layout and infuriating lack of assistants , @entity17 seems , at first glance , to offer a gruelling shopping experience			1
it is certainly a far cry from the glossy @entity29 store i usually frequent			1
yet now seems the time to sweep supermarket snobbery aside and give @entity17 a chance			1
for last week it emerged as the overall winner in a taste test of own - brand foods conducted by trade magazine @entity56			1
@entity17 came out top in 16 categories — more than @entity29 and @entity59 combined — with gold medals for everything from its bacon to its brioche			1
with praise such as this , not to mention bargain prices , it ’s no wonder the middle classes are hot - footing it there in droves and that @entity17 , which originally targeted more socially deprived areas , is now opening up in @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 on the @entity77			1
with no branches near my home in @entity81 , i head off to a store in @entity15 , the sort of town where ladies lunch and gents play golf			0
there , standing out like a sore thumb beneath the shadow of 12th - century @entity91 ’s church , lies @entity17			1
it looks like the sort of council - run place where you ’d go to get a verruca removed			2
the inside is n’t much better , with strip lighting that fails to lift the gloom and piles of stock in the middle of aisles making it hard to navigate my wobbly trolley			0
at 9.30am , the twinset and pearl shoppers are nowhere to be seen			0
instead , the store is full of pensioners all making a beeline for the famous ‘ special buy ’ section , where you can get all sorts of strange stuff ( such as the aforementioned compression bandages and head torches )			0
but i have to admit the food is impressive			0
a 200g punnet of cherries — a fruit that usually costs more than gold — is £ 1.79 , and they look impossibly juicy			2
as well as the cherries , there ’s @entity130 rhubarb for 69p , a pack of four avocados at £ 1.49 and on - the - vine tomatoes for 69p			1
middle class destination : shoppers who favour @entity29 are heading to @entity17 to buy alcohol illogical : @entity17 is known for scattered and confused displays , that mix clothes , toiletries and fresh food together bagged salad is also good value			1
a generous bag of baby leaf salad is just 79p , as is the rocket			0
there are plenty more middle - class staples available too : brie , @entity151 ham , chorizo , houmous and fresh pesto are all present and correct in the chiller cabinet			2
in most cases , there ’s only one type of each — but there ’s actually something quite liberating about not having to dither over 16 different varieties			0
the choice of teas , coffees and breakfast cereals is similarly limited but includes diplomat teabags — one of the lines @entity17 has just won an award for			1
at £ 1.39 for 60 , they ’re nearly half the price of the @entity173 i usually drink			2
@entity17 has also been much praised for its bread and baked goods , and i have to say the range is not only impressive but crazily cheap			1
four delicious - looking all - butter croissants are only 55p , while the gold medal - winning @entity181 @entity180 brioche looks irresistibly fluffy			1
all shoppers have their items that they are just not prepared to skimp on — and for me it ’s chicken and loo rolls			0
at £ 3.99 for four breast fillets , the chicken is the cheapest i ’ve seen for a long time — but it just does n’t look very nice			2
it ’s not free - range , and i suspect that by the time it comes out of the oven the pumped - up breast will have shrunk to a bite - size dog treat			0
as for the loo roll , well let ’s just say i ’ve seen sandpaper that looked softer			0
i try to remind myself that beggars ca n’t be choosers , and that while i ’m not exactly on the breadline , i could do with trimming back my food bill			0
although i live alone , i spend around £ 85 on my weekly shop at @entity29 — and that rarely includes red meat or alcohol			1
@entity17 has been found to be 40 per cent cheaper than @entity29 — and an annual saving of £ 1,700 is n’t to be sniffed at			1
that ’s two weeks in @entity207			1
an hour into my @entity17 shop , i am beginning to spy the odd well - heeled @entity210 wife : their immaculately blow - dried hair , @entity214 jeans and @entity216 ’s loafers are a dead giveaway			1
appeal : the middle classes are said to be rushing to @entity17 for wine and gin			1
bottles of £ 3.69 red wine do n't stay on the shelves for long			1
the wine has been voted one of the best in the world taste the difference : @entity17 has won an award for its diplomat teabags			1
but @entity0 still prefers @entity173 however , rather than buying their entire weekly shop at @entity17 , they are nipping in for one item			2
heading to an aisle stacked high with wines , beers and spirits , i feel i ’ve uncorked the secret to @entity17 ’s success			2
alcohol is something that @entity17 does well			2
when their £ 3.69 @entity207 red wine @entity248 was voted one of the best in the world last year , you could n’t get it for love nor money			1
today they have a supply in but it ’s going fast			0
i grab a bottle and get chatting to 66 - year - old @entity257 , who has come straight from her tennis lesson and is still dressed in her whites			2
‘ i only come in for the gin , ’ she tells me			0
‘ it ’s the best i ’ve ever tasted , and so much cheaper than brands like @entity264 ’s			0
’ she ’s right about the gin			0
in blind taste - tests , @entity17 ’s @entity265 ( £ 9.65 ) was rated better than brands like @entity268 and @entity269 , which are twice the price			1
for the most part , @entity17 sells their own ranges , interspersed with a handful of famous brands such as @entity276 and @entity277			2
they ’re also notorious for doing ‘ lookalike ’ ranges — products cunningly designed to look like well - known brands but at a fraction at the price			2
at last i feel ready to head for the chaotic central ‘ special buy ’ aisles to see if there ’s anything i ’m missing out on but as i ’m not currently in the market for a two - man tent , a catering - sized jar of pickled eggs or a 35 - piece set of spanners , i leave the bargain hunters to it and make my way to the tills			0
there are only three checkouts and the shortest queue has 14 people in it			0
when i finally reach the front , the assistant scans my food so fast his hands are a blur			0
he stacks it in a huge tower , and even though it ’s apparent i ’m struggling to keep up , he does n’t slow down and several items fall to the floor			0
back home , and with my blood pressure restored to its normal rate , i ’m keen to see if the taste of these gold medal winning foods makes up for the hassle of buying them			0
things do n’t start well with the diplomat teabags , which produce a weak and tasteless cuppa , although the @entity325 are indistinguishable from @entity327 ’s ones , which are double the price			0
the brioche is as delicious as it looks , but i ’m disappointed in both the chocolate and the lemon and mascarpone cheesecake that were singled out for praise			0
to my palate , they taste processed , not homemade			0
just as i am reaching the conclusion that shiny @entity29 is still my true love , i remember the wine and cherries			1
i almost want the cherries to be dry and bitter , but they ’re sweet and juicy — and the perfect accompaniment to my large glass of @entity248 , which must be smoothest wine i ’ve ever tasted			0
how on earth can it have cost just £ 3.69 ? suddenly i ’m regretting not having snapped up a whole box of the stuff — and a load of that award - winning gin to boot			1
@entity17 , i have a feeling i ’ll be joining the @entity210 housewives and weaving my way — perhaps a little unsteadily — down your aisles once more .			2

@entity17 *'s* own brand products are highly - regarded , such as award - winning tea and wine
