by @entity0 a mother - of - two has a sleep condition which means she has fallen asleep next to loud speakers , on the back of a moped and even on the bus holding her newborn baby			1
@entity8 , 38 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , says she suffers with narcolepsy and faces a daily battle to stay awake for her children			1
she claims she must nap for four hours a day , on top of getting nine hours sleep at night , in order to function			1
@entity8 , 38 , has the sleep condition narcolepsy which means she faces a daily battle to stay awake for her children - @entity19 , seven ( right ) , and @entity21 , 12 ( left ) ms @entity8 said : ‘ if i did n’t take my naps when the girls are at school i would fall asleep cooking them dinner , or tidying up			1
’ ms @entity8 is no longer able to drive or work , as her body is too worn out and constantly needs to rest			1
her day starts at 7am when she wakes up and helps her daughters @entity19 , seven , and @entity21 , 12 , get ready for school			2
@entity8 then walks her younger daughter to the nearby school for 9am and by 9.30am she is back in bed , taking the first of her scheduled naps			1
she wakes herself up again at 11am and will go about her day , doing the housework , preparing food and supporting the charity narcolepsy @entity39 charity			2
by 1pm ms @entity8 is ready to head back to bed for her next two - hour nap , and she sleeps until 3pm when she picks up @entity19 from school			1
ms @entity8 , who had to give up work because of her illness , has to nap for two hours in the morning and two hours in the afternoon to ensure she is awake for her children before and after school for years doctors told ms @entity8 that her symptoms were caused by stress before she was eventually diagnosed with narcolepsy after @entity21 's birth ms @entity8 says she suffers with narcolepsy , a neurological condition which means although she sleeps a lot , she does n’t get the restful sleep she needs during the night and as a result suffers constant nightmares , hallucinations and sleep paralysis			1
she said : ‘ i have a very different sleep pattern to other people and can wake up to 15 times a night , so i do n’t get the restorative sleep i need			1
‘ i get terrible nightmares and hallucinations which are triggered by things i have seen in the news or online - i slip straight back into dream sleep while drifting off which means i am unable to stop myself going back into the nightmare			1
7am - @entity70 up , have breakfast , get the children ready for school 9am - @entity19 to school 9.30am - go back to bed for the first nap 11.30am - @entity70 up from nap , continue with day including doing housework 1pm - go back to bed for afternoon nap 3pm - @entity70 up from nap 3.30pm - @entity82 from school 3.30pm - 10pm - prepare dinner for the children , enjoy the evening together 10pm - go to bed ‘ i also have hallucinations where i hear intruders coming into my home			1
‘ it ’s exhausting and incredibly emotionally draining			0
’ she added : ‘ i want to be the best parent i can be for my children so i have found that taking strategic naps during the day is the only way i can keep my sleeping under control			2
’ ms @entity8 first started to notice her symptoms of hallucinations , nightmares and extreme tiredness when she was 13 years old , but her symptoms were mild and did n’t become a serious problem until she was 26			1
she found herself falling asleep in public and in places which could have been dangerous - like on the back a moped while on a summer holiday in @entity109			0
she said : ‘ i was that tired on the holiday that i closed my eyes sitting on the back of the bike and actually nodded off straight to sleep			0
’ ms @entity8 got to the stage where she was unable to control her sleeping during the day had to take naps in laybys while driving to work			1
she said : ‘ in the past i found that despite loud music , bumpy roads and being in public my tiredness could not be stopped and before i managed my condition i could sleep anywhere			2
’ before she learned to control her condition , ms @entity8 fell asleep on a moped and also on the bus while holding @entity21 as a new - born baby ms @entity8 suffers nightmares and hallucinations at night meaning she does not sleep well			1
this causes her to be exhausted during the day and leaves her at risk of falling asleep in inappropriate places the breaking point came for ms @entity8 when she became a mother			1
she said : ‘ a few weeks after i had given birth to my eldest daughter i was sat on the bus and i found myself repeatedly nodding off , while trying to hold my new - born baby			0
‘ this was when i realised i could no longer hide from my tiredness and my doctors needed to take my complaints seriously			0
’ narcolepsy , which occurs in one in every 2,000 people , is a sleep disorder that causes a person to suddenly fall asleep at inappropriate times			2
it is a long - term neurological condition that disrupts normal sleeping patterns			2
symptoms include , sleep attacks , daytime sleepiness , nightmares , hallucinations and cataplexy - temporary muscle weakness in response to emotion			1
it is often caused by an autoimmune response - this is when antibodies are released by the body but instead of destroying disease , they attack healthy cells			0
in the case of narcolepsy , antibodies attack the areas of the brain that produce a sleep - regulating chemical			1
there is currently no cure but the condition can sometimes be managed , for example , by taking regular naps , eating healthily and exercising			0
in some cases , medications such as antidepressants or stimulants can also help			0
for 12 years she was constantly told by doctors that it was just stress was making her tired but when she was finally diagnosed she was relieved			0
she also suffers from cataplexy which means she loses control of her neck and leg muscles at moments of extreme emotion , such as if she is in pain or laughing hard			0
she manages to control this with medication , but unfortunately has n’t managed to find an effective medication for her narcolepsy - which is why she must stick religiously to her napping routine			2
before she was diagnosed , ms @entity8 would resort to extreme measures to try and keep herself awake , including taking layers off to stay cold , sitting on the most uncomfortable seat available and even physically hurting herself			2
she said : ‘ i would make excuses to go to the toilet and then slap my face , and splash myself with water to try and wake up			0
‘ i would pinch my skin really hard to try and try to use the pain to keep me awake			0
’ when she finally gained the courage to explain the severity of her narcolepsy to her friends , family and children ’s school she was pleased with the support she received			2
however , she says there were a few people who assumed her condition made her a less attentive mother - something she fiercely rejects			0
she has now worked out a routine which works for her family			0
she will save what she calls ‘ screen time ’ for time when she needs to rest , letting her children watch television , play on the laptop , or watch a dvd while she sleeps			0
ms @entity8 worries that some people think her condition makes her a less attentive mother but says she is still dedicated to her children and that she does not allow her illness to get her down she said : ‘ i do have guilt about finding time to rest when my children are in my care			1
i never wanted my children to have to occupy themselves			0
‘ but i also have to look after me - i have to rest and not step outside my limitations so i can be a good mother			0
’ she joked : ‘ the children have become wise to it now			0
they tell me i look tired and ask if i want a nap just so they can have a go on the computer ! ’ she added : ‘ although i am more tired than other people , i have n’t let it get me down and i am still dedicated to my children and determined to enjoy life			0
