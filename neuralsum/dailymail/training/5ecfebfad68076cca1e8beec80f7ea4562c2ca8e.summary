by @entity0 few would argue sir @entity1 is one of the most trusted names in the @entity3			0
but the 87 - year - old has surprised his home town with a confession - that he ' cheated ' in his school biology exam			1
aged 17 , the future broadcasting legend used his already impressive knowledge of the animal kingdom to work out which animal would be used in a dissection test			1
popular : sir @entity1 has revealed he once ' cheated ' in the equivalent of his a-levels his class at @entity16 , @entity17 , had been told they would be experimenting either on a rabbit , dogfish , crayfish , frog or earthworm			1
but because it was during the @entity25 and people ate rabbits and dogfish , he knew he could count them out			0
specimen : sir @entity1 fished crayfish from a stream then he had a stroke of luck when a caretaker brought in a metal tin with the words ' zoology practical ' unwisely written on the side			1
sir @entity1 told the @entity39 : ' when i got the chance i picked it up and shook it			0
it rattled so i knew it was crayfish			1
' i knew where i could get crayfish - the stream at [ nearby ] @entity47 , so i headed there			2
i told all the other boys			0
' they then fished crayfish out of the stream and practiced dissection on them to finesse their skills			1
the move clearly paid off			0
not only did sir @entity1 and his friends win distinctions in the exam - which was the equivalent of a modern a-level exam - but their teacher also said they were the most brilliant class he had ever had			1
sir @entity1 made the confession as he revisited the park , a former @entity66 deer hunting ground which is now run by a charitable trust			0
he was there to help the local @entity69 launch an appeal to raise Â £ 150,000 to turn an old barn into a visitor centre			0
there was good reason for choosing the tv naturalist for the event - as sir @entity1 's father was once the president of the @entity69 of @entity17			2
he told the @entity3 : ' @entity78 is a very important part of my childhood ... we came here as a family up onto those rocks , onto the tower , paddling in the stream			2
' it was a vision of what the @entity89 countryside could be like and it 's stayed with me forever			0
