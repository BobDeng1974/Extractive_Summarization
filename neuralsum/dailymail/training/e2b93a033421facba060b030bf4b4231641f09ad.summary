mrs @entity20 said : ' @entity45 would have been chuffed to bits if she 'd have been there to see the funeral			0
the service was wonderful and that 's really given me closure			2
it was hard when she died and i could n't bury her , but now she 's back with me in her urn my living room			1
' i would love to fulfil my promise and take her out on my @entity44 but when i got her back i could n't bring myself to take them out to scatter			2

plus they are really heavy - in fact almost as heavy as when she was alive			0
' talking of her reaction to her mother 's bizarre request , mrs @entity20 , who lives with husband @entity74 , 59 , said : ' i totally supported her with what she wanted to do			2
i was in the police at the time and i went to lots of post-mortems , so i was n't freaked out about it			0
' she was really into teaching and used to love watching operations on tv			0
she had even watched a video about a mastectomy so she knew what had happened to her			0
' mrs @entity2 married her husband in 1946			1
he served in the @entity88 and the couple went on to run a newsagent 's shop which they had for 20 years			2

mrs @entity20 said : ' @entity45 had her left breast removed because of cancer in 1973 when she was 50 and within two days she had a mastectomy			1
it 's not like now when you have treatment like chemotherapy , they just took away the breast			2
mrs @entity2 's wish was for her ashes to be scattered off the back of her daughter 's @entity44 motorbike @entity20 waited two years for her mother 's body to be released , after the selfless grandmother donated her organs for medical science ' she was surprised that there was no cure for cancer , so after her mastectomy she applied to donate her body to medical research so that she could help other sufferers in the future			1
' mrs @entity2 agreed to have let scientists test her arms and fingers for arthritis but in july 2010 she taken ill with a bad back and tests showed the cancer had returned to her lungs			1
mrs @entity20 said : ' she died in my arms on november 6			0
it was horrible but in glad it was me that was there with her			0
she did n't suffer which is what matters			0
i ca n't ask for any more than that and the university took her body away			0
' they would n't tell us what sort of research was carried out but eventually we got a letter from the university saying that they were releasing my mum 's body			2
' they said that they had arranged a cremation service and i rang them up to confirm that we would be attending			0
pictured : @entity153 , left aged five and right , 21 , fought breast and lung cancer , and was determined that doctors use her to help them research cancer mrs @entity20 , pictured left aged 35 , was thanked for her ' selfless and public spirited donation ' by the professor of anatomy at @entity11 ' they said that i could have as many people there as i liked but with it being two years after her death only three of us went , but it was still a lovely service			1
@entity2 donated her body to medical science at @entity11 after she fought cancer twice ' we did n't want to wear black so we wore mum 's favourite colour purple			1
we arrived at the crematorium at 10:30am expecting to be handed her ashes but the university had paid for a proper funeral with a hearse - complete with a purple wreath			0
' even the chaplain had a purple tie on			0
i know it was a coincidence but my mum gets her own way every time			0
' ' looking back it was difficult but it was what she wanted			0
i have since asked my husband what he would do if i wanted to donate my body like mum did			2
he said he 'd be happy with whatever i wanted so i 'm considering it			0
after all they did such a good job with mum 's funeral i know i 'd be in good hands			0
' at the time of mrs @entity2 's death , professor of anatomy at the university , @entity201 said : ' we send our condolences to @entity2 's family and are tremendously grateful to mrs @entity2 for her selfless and public spirited donation			1
