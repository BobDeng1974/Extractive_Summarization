@entity0 beat @entity1 3 - 0 at @entity2 in the @entity3			1
@entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 got themselves among the goals , but @entity9 topped the lot in @entity12 's player ratings			1
@entity0 @entity13 - 6.5 had little to do but such is his current form there was no doubt he would deal with the sporadic occasion that @entity1 managed to get the ball in the @entity0 box			1
@entity21 - 6.5 given @entity0 ’s seemingly endless injury list , @entity22 is turning into an important squad man for @entity25 and , against such modest opposition , looked a decent right - back			1
@entity4 - 8 a goalscorer , thanks to some dodgy goalkeeping , but also turned in a commanding display at the back that suggests his recent nightmare at the @entity34 is behind him			2
@entity4 scores the opening goal of the match for @entity0 against @entity1 @entity38 - 6.5 back from injury , his solid showing alongside @entity4 was another plus point for @entity25 although far stiffer test await			1
@entity43 - 6.5 presumably left - back is not his favoured position but against opposition like this , it scarcely mattered			0
maybe the @entity25 “ philosophy ” is finally being picked up by his players though because @entity43 fitted in there seemlessly			0
@entity51 - 6 was looking lively in the opening quarter of an hour until a hamstring injury forced him off			0
@entity43 ( right ) celebrates with @entity5 during @entity0 's comfortable 3 - 0 win @entity56 - 7 has grown in stature over the past few weeks and no longer looks the joke signing he did a few months ago			1
his physicality and size at set pieces adds an important dimension to @entity0 ’s play			0
@entity66 - 7 really steady performance , barely wasted a pass and provided a valuable barrier in front of an inexperienced and makeshift back four			0
@entity9 - 9 for a man whose future at the club has been under much debate , he certainly looked like a match winner			2
in the right system , and right conditions , is still world - class			0
@entity9 was a match winner for @entity0 and played world class for @entity82 's @entity0 @entity5 - 7 his goal was a textbook finish and vintage @entity5 while his corner sent panic through the @entity1 defence and led to the opener			1
@entity6 - 7 the finish was excellent , as was a diving header that was offside but still showed his scoring instincts are alive and well			2
the goal will have done his flagging confidence the world of good			0
@entity6 and @entity5 celebrate together during the 3 - 0 win over @entity1 at @entity2 subs @entity99 ( on for @entity100 15 - 7 ) @entity101 ( on for @entity6 70 - 6 ) @entity102 ( on for @entity22 73 ) @entity1 @entity103 - 5 had two opportunities to deal with the opening goal and fluffed both ; after that , it was downhill for him and his team			1
@entity111 - 6 did well to put off @entity6 as he looked certain to score in the first half but spent the rest of the game fighting a desperate rearguard action			1
@entity116 - 6.5 threw his body in the way of plenty of shots - to important effect on more than one occasion and made an incredible block to thwart @entity101 - but struggled to cope with the movement and strength of @entity5			2
@entity116 clashes with @entity126 at @entity2 during a busy afternoon for the @entity1 defender @entity128 - 5 no lack of effort but couple of fundamental unforced errors , especially laying the ball off for @entity6 to tee up @entity5 for the killer second goal			1
@entity135 - 7 forced de @entity13 into his first “ save ” of the game with a decent run and toe - poke at the @entity0 keeper after 53 minutes - that stat said more about @entity1 ’s toothless attacking play than anything else			1
@entity143 - 6.5 at least he looked as if he cared - which ca n’t be said of all his team mates - but had the thankless task of sitting in front of a back four that was under pressure for most of the 90 minutes			0
@entity135 fends off @entity5 during the 3 - 0 match that ended in @entity0 's favour @entity152 - 5.5 with @entity0 ’s full - backs pushing high up the field , @entity1 ’s wide midfielders were always doomed to spend the contest on the back foot and so it proved with @entity152			1
@entity159 - 5.5 @entity0 ’s midfield ran riot and controlled the game with almost embarrassing ease			2
surely @entity164 expects more from the likes of @entity166			0
@entity167 - 4 brought off 10 minutes before the break as @entity164 looked to gain a foothold in the game			0
@entity167 had not looked like providing one			0
@entity167 was brought off 10 minutes before the break as he failed to get a foothold in the game @entity175 - 5 hardly his fault that he made zero impact on proceedings given the fact he and @entity1 barely saw the ball all afternoon			2
@entity182 - 6 couple of headed half chances came his way late on in proceedings and at least he looked interested and , in the case of the second one , forced a save out of @entity188			0
@entity182 had a couple of headed chances late in the game but could not get on the score sheet subs @entity194 ( on for @entity167 35 - 6 ) @entity195 ( on for @entity175 74 ) @entity196 ( on for @entity197 )			0

@entity0 won 3 - 0 against @entity1 at @entity2
@entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 got a goal *apiece*
@entity9 topped the lot as he put in a solid performance for @entity0
