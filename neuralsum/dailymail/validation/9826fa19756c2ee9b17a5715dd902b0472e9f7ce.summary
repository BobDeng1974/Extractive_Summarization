@entity1 's comedown from being seconds away from winning last season 's @entity3 final only to concede in the 90th minute and finish up losing 4 - 1 will reach a new low on tuesday night if they go out of this year 's tournament at the hands of @entity7			1
coach @entity8 is counting on the spirit that got them to last year 's showpiece in @entity12 to pull them through and for the @entity16 @entity15 parternship that produced 14 goals and eight assists in january and february before hitting something of a wall in march to fire them into the last eight			1
if those two fail he will have to call on @entity23 who insisted in an interview in @entity25 on the eve of the game that he did feel part of @entity30 's @entity3 success in 2012			1
@entity8 has called on the home support to lift his side as they attempt to come from behind @entity1 have not been at their best of late , but need to bounce back against @entity7 he said : ' i had made some important contributions			1
i scored in the semi-final against @entity38 and i come on for the last eight minutes of normal time against @entity40 in the final and i think i played my part in the comeback			0
i am very proud to have won the @entity3			0
' he would dearly love to repeat his success for @entity30 with a repeat run to the final for his hometown club but @entity1 have given themselves a difficult job after a poor first leg performance that ended with @entity51 winning 1 - 0			1
the failure to find an away goal three weeks ago makes them outsiders tonight despite the battle cry from @entity8 that there should not even be so much as a minute of quiet in the @entity58 before and during the game			0
@entity61 ' 90th minute header denied @entity1 their first ever @entity3 title last summer @entity63 , rather than @entity8 , was left to lift the famous trophy in @entity12 @entity8 has never won a knockout tie after losing the first leg , but must turn that around on tuesday despite the motivational magic of @entity1 's charismatic manager , the @entity67 has never over-turned a first leg deficit since he has been at the club			1
under his stewardship @entity1 have won 16 of 19 knockout matches but the three times they have suffered first leg defeats they have been eliminated			0
the coach 's biggest concern will be that in the pusuit of goals they will concede			0
they have gone five @entity3 games without letting in a goal but there are cracks appearing in their defence			0
@entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 will provide a serious test for out of sorts holding midfielder @entity91 , veteran right - back @entity92 – filing in at left - back in the absence of any better alternative – and central defensive partnership of @entity97 and @entity98 forced on @entity8 through @entity100 's suspension			2
around 1,300 supporters have travelled from @entity102 to @entity103 for the game			0
' we know they have a strong mentality , ' says @entity7 coach @entity108 of @entity1			2
' but we have to keep a cool head in what will be a very hot atmosphere			0
' video @entity1 game tough despite lead - @entity108 @entity91 ( left ) has been out of form , and will be up against a formidable @entity7 front line the likes of @entity87 ( standing centre ) and @entity86 ( right ) will cause @entity1 problems the sparks are sure to fly after first leg when @entity108 clashed with @entity8 's number two @entity120			1
' @entity1 will provoke , bite , scratch and kick us , ' @entity7 director @entity122 was quoted as saying in the @entity1 press while @entity126 called for 50,000 @entity127 on its front page on tuesday			2
when @entity1 reached the @entity3 final in 1974 and lost in a reply to @entity40 having been just seconds from winning in the first game before a late equalizer , it took them 40 years to get back to another final			1
they do n't want the same fate this time			0
tuesday night will be as biggest test as @entity8 and his players have faced since winning @entity138 last season .			2

@entity1 were just minutes from winning the @entity3
@entity8 's team conceded late in @entity12 , and have *struggled* since
they face @entity7 on tuesday with a 1 - 0 deficit from first leg
