@entity24 employment tribunal last year refused to hear her £ 3.5 million claim for sex discrimination and unfair dismissal last year , saying it was outside its jurisdiction			1
but now @entity30 judge @entity29 has ruled that miss @entity2 should be allowed to take legal action in @entity32 , where she currently lives			2
her $ 35 million claim accuses @entity14 of sexual harassment , discrimination , wrongful termination of her employment , retaliation , breach of contract , intentional infliction of emotional distress , negligent retention and supervision of the lawyer who allegedly harassed her , defamation , and conspiracy			1
@entity14 once again tried to have miss @entity2 ’s case kicked out for lack of jurisdiction - but judge @entity51 ruled in her favour on seven out of eight counts			1

she says he was then left ' infuriated ' when he spotting her with a new , @entity98 boyfriend			2
she claims : ' when i rebuffed his further advances and took up with a much younger and @entity98 man , it infuriated him and made him crazy with jealousy and that that is why i was dismissed			2

i do too many drugs			0
i f * * k around			0

i spend too much time at parties			0
there ’s a shorter way of saying all that : " i live in @entity17 "			1
' miss @entity2 was sacked by @entity14 in january 2009 and told it was because of the novel , racy poetry and revealing pictures of herself that she was posting on her website			1

but she alleges : ' one of my potential clients said he often sees @entity143 people at whorehouses and throwing up in bars			0
' he could n’t understand how my little book could possibly bring the firm into disrepute			0
' in her subsequent newspaper column for the @entity151 called ‘ @entity152 ’ she wrote : ' men have been dragging women by the hair since caveman days			0
it ’s in their nature to be violent			0
' the human male has evolved to slap his slutty woman ... if you ’re hanging out with real men and you ’re a little slutty , you ’re going to get hit			0
' miss @entity2 described rape as ' simply part of human nature ' , adding : ' at any rate , it works out perfectly for me			0
when it goes to raping and pillaging , i say : bring it on , baby ! ! ! ' in one article entitled ‘ come on , cavemen ! ’ , miss @entity2 said she ' gets off on being bound and whipped inside the bedroom '			0
