@entity2 space expert @entity0 claimed to have discovered life on @entity4 after analysing photographs taken by a @entity7 probe that landed on the planet 's surface 30 years ago			1
@entity11 photo analysts have been quick to debunk his claims , based on photos taken by the @entity2 probe @entity4 - 13 in 1982			1
the ' disc ' that is seen ' moving ' on the surface is in fact a lens cap , and the ' scorpion ' seen by @entity20 is in fact ' noise ' in a seocnd - hand picture which is not present in the original image			1
images of the surface of @entity4 taken by the @entity28 descent module in 1982 : @entity2 scientist @entity29 claimed to have seen a ' disc ' moving , but image analysts point out that it 's more likely to be a lens cap @entity34 and 14 were identical @entity2 space probes built to take advantage of the 1981 @entity4 launch opportunity			1
they launched 5 days apart @entity0 said the images showed a scorpion - shaped body , a disc and a ' black flap , ' which apparently moved as the probe 's camera records the scene			2
in comments reported by a @entity2 news agency , he said , ' they all ' emerge , fluctuate and disappear , ' explained @entity0 , writing in the @entity2 journal @entity51			0
' what if we forget about the current theories about the non-existence of life on @entity4 , let 's boldly suggest that the objects ' morphological features would allow us to say that they are living , ' he added			2
@entity60 , a @entity11 photo analysts says that it 's more likely that the ' disc ' in particular came from the craft			1
' @entity34 had two cameras , one in front and one in back			0
the one image shows the front camera lens cap and the other shows the rear camera lens cap , not one lens cap that moved , ' he says , in comments on @entity75			1
new life ? @entity2 scientist @entity0 , claims this image , taken from a probe that landed on @entity4 in 1982 , shows a scorpion - shaped life form the probe is bottom of the picture and left , with debris in the middle ; @entity0 said that he had spotted several objects which seemed to ' move ' as if alive , including a disc - but space experts say that the ' new life ' is probably a lens cap @entity4 is the most similar planet in our solar system in terms of size and structure to @entity97			1
its diameter is 7521 miles – very close to @entity97 ’s 7926 - mile diameter			0
but the surface is very different - it ’s the hottest planet in the solar system , thanks to its atmosphere being 97 per cent carbon dioxide – a heat - trapping greenhouse gas			1
it is 67.2million miles from the @entity109 constant surface temperature is @entity110 - hot enough to melt lead , and hotter than @entity112 , the closest planet to the sun. the atmospheric pressure is 96 times higher than @entity117 in the solar system , it rotates ‘ backwards ’ , with the @entity118 rising in the west and setting in the east			1
experts believe this was caused by an impact with a huge object in the distant past			0
@entity126 , a @entity11 mission planner , echoes his comments , ' if those objects were already on the surface of @entity4 , what are the chances that @entity34 and 14 , which landed nearly 1,000 kilometers apart , would both land inches away from the only ones in sight and they would be in the same positions relative to the spacecraft ? ' it makes much more sense that it 's a piece of the lander designed to break off during the deployment of one of the scientific instrument			2
' the scorpion ' found ' by @entity20 is also just ' noise ' in a digital image , say experts - and it 's not in the original image			1
the @entity2 scientist is the author of several space publications including the book @entity112			0
there are no records of life on @entity4 , which has a surface temperature of 464 degrees @entity156			0
' similar in structure and size to @entity97 , @entity4 ' thick , toxic atmosphere traps heat in a runaway " greenhouse effect , ' says @entity11			0
scientists have not ruled out the possibility of life having once existed on @entity4 - but most research has focused on whether there were oceans , and possibly life , in the distant past , before the ' greenhouse effect ' created the scorching temperatures that exist on the surface today			0
' current theories suggest that @entity4 and the @entity97 may have started out alike			0
there might have been a lot of water on @entity4 and there might have been a lot of carbon dioxide on @entity97 , ' professor @entity171 of @entity172 said in a paper published in @entity180 in 2004			0
@entity4 , as mapped by @entity11 's @entity182 probe : the probe used radar to map the planet 's surface before plunging into @entity4 's hellishly hot atmosphere @entity0 pictured at @entity2 's @entity188 since the @entity2 probe visited the planet , @entity11 probes have created much more detailed pictures of the surface - in which no living beings appear			1
@entity11 's @entity182 spacecraft , named after the sixteenth - century @entity197 explorer whose expedition first circumnavigated the @entity97 , was launched may 4 , 1989 , and arrived at @entity4 on august 10 , 1990			2
during the first eight - month mapping cycle around @entity4 , @entity182 collected radar images of 84 percent of the planet 's surface , with resolution 10 times better than that of the earlier @entity206 missions			0
' during the extended mission , two further mapping cycles from may 15 , 1991 to september 14 , 1992 brought mapping coverage to 98 % of the planet , with a resolution of approximately 100m , ' says @entity11			2
this composite picture of @entity4 was created from @entity11 's radar investigations including @entity182 's 1990 - 1994 mission			2
the planet 's surface is hot enough to melt lead , heated by a runaway ' greenhouse effect ' comic book hero @entity218 battled against the @entity220 , ruler of @entity4 in @entity224 comic @entity222			0

scientist sees shapes in 1982 @entity7 probe pictures
image analysts say the pictures show a lens cap and ' noise ' in a digital photo
@entity11 experts say it 's more likely to be a lens cap that fell off , not a creature that the probes landed right next to
no previous records of life on the hottest planet in solar system
