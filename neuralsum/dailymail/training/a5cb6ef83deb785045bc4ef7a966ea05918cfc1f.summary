@entity0 carries the hopes of the @entity3 nation on his shoulders — and is delivering some sublime football			1
ahead of @entity8 ’s game against @entity9 , @entity6 publishes a fascinating extract from his autobiography in which @entity0 , 22 , and his father chart the rise of a boy the family call @entity16			1
i had played for @entity30 on that day			1
i was driving with my wife @entity31 at my side and our son @entity16 was sleeping soundly , strapped to the baby seat at the back of my red car			1
driving down the mountain on a rainy day is always dangerous — especially on a road with a single lane and two - way traffic			1
a car came in our direction			1
i swerved to the left			1
the other car crashed into us and went through my door			1
my left leg ended up above my right leg			1
my pubis and pelvis dislocated			1
i was in shock and yelled to my wife ‘ i ’m dying , i ’m dying ’			1
it all happened very fast and confusion settled in			1
the feeling that came next was even worse than pain and fear : where was my son ? me and my wife could n’t find @entity59			1
i thought he had been thrown out of the car			1
we were almost certain we had lost our son			2
in the middle of the despair and with the pain in my pelvis , i can only remember praying to @entity67 to take me instead of my son			2
the car stopped on a cliff			1
there was a stream below			2
we were hanging just above it			2
@entity31 had to get out through the back window			2
i was trapped by the seatbelt			2
the people who came to our rescue found @entity16 under the back seat			2
thank @entity67 ! when they took him out , he was covered in blood and taken to a hospital			2
all that blood was from a small cut in his head made by a shard of glass			1
lucky to be here : @entity0 's father feared his son was dead just four months into his life after a car crash @entity93 : @entity0 curls a freekick towards goal as he limbers up ahead of the knockout stages quiet reflection : @entity8 's talisman takes a moment out from the session , hidden behind a static 5 - man wall samba magic : @entity0 has scored four goals at this @entity17 to fire @entity8 into the last 16 @entity103 it was august 23 , 2010			1
my father and i had a meeting with president @entity108 at the @entity28 headquarters , inside the @entity110			1
@entity111 had made a huge transfer bid			1
in the middle of our conversation , the president turned off the lights and pointed at an empty chair			2
‘ this is the chair of the great national sports hero			2
since @entity122 ’s death , this chair is vacant			2
if @entity59 stays in @entity28 and refuses @entity111 ’s proposal , he will give his first step to sit in this chair			1
’ that made us think			1
that decision would be a turning point in my life			1
can you imagine how important i felt ? the @entity134 called and asked me to stay			1
he reminded me of his entire career with @entity28 , his five world titles with the national team and the club , and all the recognition he received			1
it was n’t easy but it was the right decision for us			2
we did the right thing for our family , friends and my career			1
call from the top : a call from @entity132 , considered the greatest ever player , stopped @entity0 joining @entity111 praise : @entity0 celebrates a goal for @entity8 - a year after leaving home club @entity28 for @entity151 master ball : @entity0 stands over one of eight @entity155 balls - a tactic which could help him to the @entity157 man of many talents : @entity0 leaps to head a ball towards goal in training his joy came before cash ( by @entity0 ’s father ) when @entity59 was 13 years old , my son and i went on a plane for the very first time			1
we spent 19 days in @entity170			2
@entity171 made a proposal similar to what @entity151 had made with @entity174 when he was a kid			1
they would take @entity59 to @entity171 and he would grow up in @entity170 , as a man and athlete			1
the payment was very good — and he was just a teenager ! after 19 days , he scored 27 goals at the training sessions			1
within the first three days , we had agreed on everything			2
@entity16 and his sister , @entity184 , were to receive scholarships			2
the only thing missing was his mother ’s signature			2
@entity31 had a ticket to go to @entity190 with me and @entity16 , but preferred to stay at home with our daughter			1
after less than a week , @entity16 did n’t seem well			2
he started to feel homesick			2
he missed our family , our friends , his school , his city and @entity28			1
the food was all right , but we really wanted to eat our good old rice and beans			2
no money can pay for that			2
i saw @entity59 become sadder each day that passed			2
even with everything @entity171 were doing for us , i felt the moment was n’t right			1
so , we decided to fly back to @entity28			1
i did n’t care we were abdicating from so much money			0
all i wanted was for him to continue to play with joy			0
and there was no joy on those days			0
no money could ever change that			0
all pays off : @entity0 is now the hero of millions as @entity8 seek to win the @entity17 on home soil full package : @entity8 's number 10 has four goals so far , making him this @entity17 's joint top goalscorer all smiles : @entity0 during his @entity28 days - in 2012 - before the young striker 's big move to @entity151 training to @entity227 improvising is essential in football			1
i learned this early in life			1
you might have some play in mind and train for that a lot			0
but it ’s in the heat of the game that you ’ll know if it works or not			0
the secret is that it ’s possible to ‘ train ’ how to improvise			0
how many times did i do that at home ? i used to get the ball , set up the furniture and go around dribbling anything that popped up in front of me			0
that ’s how i spent my childhood at my grandfather ’s house , where i lived with my parents			0
we shared a small room : me , my sister and my parents			0
from the door , there was a mattress to the left , where we all slept			0
in front of the mattress there was a trunk and a wardrobe			0
there was a small space between the mattress and the wardrobe and it was in this narrow corridor that i used to play with the ball			0
i used to love to kick the ball around there and also liked to throw myself at the mattress as a goalie			0
i mean — they were part of the game			0
@entity279 was one of the goalposts			1
@entity184 , my sister , was one of the posts for a long time			0
@entity283 and @entity284 were the opponents ( actually , more like training dummies , with all due respect )			1
they stood as obstacles and sometimes even wore sports jerseys so i could pretend it was a real match			0
later , at the little house my father was able to build , the ‘ pitch ’ was very simple			0
one of the goals was on the back door			0
i played , narrated and cheered			0
‘ and then @entity0 scored ! @entity297 ! ’ me ! i miss all that			1
there were even ‘ fouls ’			0
when i dribbled and hit the sofa , i complained to the imaginary referee			0
but i played like it was for real			0
the other day , i did a photo shoot for an ad campaign			0
when we finished , i asked for the ball we used			0
i went to the elevators doing freestyle ‘ kick ups ’			0
i continued for the whole trip down			0
at the lobby , a couple of kids asked for autographs			0
after a few pictures i continued to play with the ball all the way to my car			1
i ’ll tell you , i ca n’t live without the ball			0
looking up : arguably only @entity132 and @entity321 now stand ahead of @entity0 in the list of @entity3 greats mixing it up : @entity325 ca n't quite get to the ball quick enough ahead of the nimble - footed @entity0 poise : @entity0 readies himself to score @entity8 's opening goal against @entity330 in their 4 - 1 @entity17 victory mobbed at the shops i realised things had changed on a tuesday afternoon , right at the beginning of my career in 2010 , when i left after a training session			1
i decided to go to the mall to buy a music player			0
i parked my car and , when i stepped out , there were about 10 people asking for autographs and pictures			1
i started to give the autographs and a big line formed at the parking lot			0
suddenly , it was a real crowd			0
i thanked everyone , put my cap on and entered the mall fast			0
when i entered the store , a full commotion was formed			0
the mall security and the manager had to create a security operation			0
i do n’t even know how i got out of there			0
at first , i did n’t understand all that			0
it was a bit scary			0
some girls would cry so much when they saw me			0
and there were a lot of kids with the hairstyle i had			0
all this affection is rewarding , but it did scare me			0
