@entity0 , a multi-millionaire former mayor who is battling a prominent tea party challenger for the @entity4 congressional nomination in a @entity6 district , ran an insurance company accused of cheating disaster victims , @entity9 can reveal			1
from 2002 until late 2010 , @entity0 was chairman of the board of @entity11 , a unit of the global insurer @entity12			1
he was also the company 's president and ceo from 1999 to 2009 and a major shareholder until at least 2006			0
@entity16 boasts on its website that ' we re-price 500,000 medical bills per year and save clients an average of 61 % on each bill			0
' that cost - cutting focus caught up with the company in 2008 after @entity25 devastated the @entity27 @entity26 and a massive wildfire laid waste to hundreds of homes in @entity31 , @entity32			1
it ended up settling two @entity25 - related lawsuits and paying a sizable fine to the state of @entity32 in connection with allegations of underpaying claims from the fire 's victims			1
it helps them save money by carefully vetting and processing their claims			0
@entity61 , the company 's senior vice president , told @entity9 that ' the amount of work we do is determined by what our clients would like us to process on their behalf			0
' ' however , since we are not an insurance company we do not play the role of one			1
' @entity16 's apparent hand in determining the size of claim payouts , however , has landed it in the same legal hot water as the companies it serves , facing legal accusations along with them of unfairly slow - walking , low - balling or denying claims			1
@entity0 , the @entity6 congressional candidate , is not named personally in any of the legal actions described in this report , but he was both a @entity16 officer and a major shareholder			1
the @entity84 , @entity85 , which suffered extensive damage following @entity25 in 2008 , filed a lawsuit against @entity16 and three other insurers			1
both the storm and the resulting insurance claims came on @entity0 's watch			1
and @entity16 , along with another @entity12 unit , paid the state of @entity32 a $ 285,000 settlement following charges that they violated the state 's @entity98 regulations while handling damage claims following a massive november 14 , 2008 fire in the town of @entity31			1
that blaze , known in the @entity104 as the @entity106 fire , burned more than 11,000 acres of forest and destroyed 600 structures and 480 mobile homes			0
it also produced hundreds of ' total loss ' homeowners claims , including those covering 370 mobile home policies held by @entity12 's @entity115 @entity114			2
the @entity116 claimed that the two companies had underpaid the devastated homeowners by 10.8 million			1
@entity16 , led by @entity0 , was responsible for processing and evaluating those claims as part of @entity115 insurance 's outsourcing strategy			1
the two companies each paid half the penalty , or $ 142,500 , according to court documents			1
both denied wrongdoing , but agreed to a settlement in august 2012 to end @entity32 's years - long investigation into 125 separate alleged violations of the @entity131			2
much of coastal @entity85 , including @entity84 and cities as far inland as @entity133 , were slammed with flood and wind damage after @entity25 hit in september 2008 water everywhere : insurers paid out $ 16.2 billion in claims after @entity25 , with another estimated $ 1.2 billion coming after litigation the two suits related to @entity25 , the massive 2008 storm that swept through the @entity26 and crippled coastal @entity85 , were settled with undisclosed terms			1
one , filed by @entity142 , alleged that @entity16 low - balled its settlement offer after the hurricane laid waste to its main administration building and student center			2
@entity148 , the school 's president , told the campus @entity151 newspaper that it would cost more than $ 21 million to repair and rebuild the structure			0
but @entity154 and @entity16 , which evaluated and vetted the claim , offered about $ 5 million			2
' they drug [ sic ] their feet , ' @entity148 said in 2010 of the case that began during @entity0 's tenure			0
' they were n’t very responsive			0
they obviously have not paid us what they owe us under our coverage			0
i do n’t think the insurance company has acted in good faith			2
' terms of @entity16 's 2011 settlement with @entity142 – which came only after @entity0 left – were kept sealed			2
but on february 22 , 2011 @entity148 told the school 's trustees that he ' went to bed the other night with a big grin on my face , and when i woke up , it was still there			0
' the university president was happy enough about the size of the checks @entity16 and @entity154 wrote to credit the @entity181 with the result			0
' this is a testament to the goodness and faithfulness of @entity186 , ' he said , according to the campus paper			0
another @entity25 legal action involving @entity16 came from the @entity84 on the @entity189			1
the @entity85 harbor was insured for at least $ 55 million , with @entity191 owing the last $ 15 million after other insurers had paid their part			1
@entity16 was the company tasked with evaluating and processing the @entity84 claim for @entity196			1
' @entity196 owed us the last layer of our insurance , which was $ 15 million , ' @entity84 director @entity200 told the @entity133 - based @entity201 – which reported that the port recovered the entire $ 15 million in a 2012 settlement without going to trial			1
the pool of insurers ' had got to $ 40 million and had stopped paying us ; and that ’s why we sued them , ' he said			2
the @entity32 wildfire turned a thriving community of more than 600 homes into a ghost town , with the @entity32 government finding more than $ 10 million in underpaid insurance settlements after the fire : hundreds of homeowners were left with bricks steps and concrete slabs where their prefabricated homes had stood , and the state of @entity32 pursued @entity16 and another insurance company for allegedly cheating them out of $ 10.8 million the @entity224 has embraced @entity0 as one of its so - called ' young guns , ' suggesting a vigor and fearlessness usually associated with strong retail campaigners			1
but according to the @entity230 , a $ 2 million cash loan from @entity0 's personal wealth makes up nearly his entire election war chest			2
he is running a tight race with @entity236 favorite @entity235			2
both men are former mayors of @entity6 towns			0
@entity0 's cash - on - hand , though , reportedly dwarfs @entity235 's by a 10 - to - 1 margin			1
' i ’m not going to buy a congressional seat , ' @entity235 told the @entity230 on april 15			2
' i could put a lot more money in the race			0
i ’m not going to because you do n’t buy your seat			0
' @entity0 has insisted that he is raising money from ordinary @entity251 as the june 3 primary election draws near			0
@entity253 , his campaign spokesman , emailed @entity9 an aggressive statement , lashing out at @entity255 – who he claimed was responsible for this report			0
' another day , another embarrassment for @entity235 , ' @entity258 wrote , complaining that the tea partier 's campaign ' would go to such extreme and underhanded lengths to plant a hatchet job story , and then fail to get their facts straight			2
' ' under @entity0 ’s leadership , @entity16 handled upwards of one million insurance claims , ' @entity253 added			1
' from that , the best @entity235 ’s crew could do was find three cases – all of which were settled after @entity0 had already left the company and none of which found wrongdoing by @entity16			1
' ' two of the cases were settled out of court and dismissed , and the third was a case pressed by an ultra-liberal @entity32 @entity282 politician that was also ultimately settled			0
' @entity142 president @entity148 fought @entity11 and its client over unpaid millions to fix a campus building hit by @entity25 , winning an undisclosed settlement that he attributed to divine intervention former @entity288 , @entity6 , mayor @entity235 , last year 's @entity289 also - ran , is a tea party favorite who might benefit if revelations about @entity0 's past cause him electoral troubles @entity235 lost a shot at a @entity289 seat last year , falling in a special election to defeat then - @entity299 mayor @entity298			1
but in that race , he carried the 3rd @entity301 that he now wants to represent in @entity302			0
three democrats are vying to face the @entity4 victor , including lawyers @entity305 and @entity307 , and @entity309 devotee @entity308			0
the eventual winner in november will replace two - term rep. @entity311 , a former pro football player who is retiring			0
in a march poll sponsored by @entity313 , @entity235 held a commanding lead with 41 per cent support			0
@entity0 ' barely moved the needle ' with 2 per cent , the political website reported			0
but that was in a three - way race : @entity321 , @entity6 city councilman @entity320 withdrew from the race last month and later endorsed @entity0			2
since then , @entity0 has surged forward but it 's unclear by how much – or how little			0
the state 's @entity4 establishment has also coalesced around @entity0 , with @entity4 parties in both counties straddling the 3rd district endorsing him in late march			1
his campaign website describes him as ' a self - made businessman running for @entity302 to be a leader in promoting policies that spur job creation and empower people ; that ensure our recovery and renewal in the wake of [ @entity340 ] @entity339			0
' @entity0 is quoted on the site saying he believes in a small federal government that , among other things , ' gives a hand up to those in need			2

@entity0 ran @entity11 , a unit of @entity12 insurance , when the company allegedly *skimped* on a series of high - risk claims
@entity16 paid half of a $ 285,000 fine following government claims that it underpaid *policyholders* by $ 10.8 million after a massive @entity32 wildfire
a @entity359 *college* in @entity133 and the @entity84 , @entity85 sued @entity16 and other insurers for skirting *multimillion* - *dollar* claims after @entity25
the @entity4 establishment favorite is fighting a *pitched* battle with tea - party candidate @entity235 for a chance at a @entity27 @entity367 seat in november
