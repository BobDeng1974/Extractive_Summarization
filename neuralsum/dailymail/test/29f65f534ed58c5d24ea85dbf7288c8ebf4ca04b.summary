@entity0 wants to lead the line for @entity2 in the @entity3 – but before then he could be leading @entity4 to the top - flight after inspiring this vital victory over @entity7			1
@entity4 boss @entity8 said before the game that his team had to win all four of their remaining matches to finish in the top two of a claustrophobic championship			1
and thanks to @entity17 loanee @entity15 – creator of one for @entity19 and scorer of the other - the @entity21 remain on course for what would be a deserved return to the top division			1
@entity0 ( second right ) scored @entity4 's second goal as they beat @entity7 on tuesday night @entity4 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity28 ; @entity29 , @entity30 ( @entity31 62 ) , @entity32 , friend ; @entity34 , @entity35 ; @entity36 ( @entity37 80 ) , @entity38 , @entity15 ; @entity19 ( @entity39 74 )			1

@entity47 ( 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 ) : @entity48 ; @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 ( @entity53 45 ) ; @entity54 ( @entity55 77 ) , @entity56 , @entity57 ( @entity58 63 ) , @entity59 ; @entity60 ; afobe			2

referee : @entity68 ( @entity69 )			0
@entity4 were relegated in 2009 and even the play - offs have been beyond them in the years since			1
this maximum at least guaranteed post-season participation , but they will want to avoid that scenario			0
and with the likes of @entity0 in this kind of form they have every chance of going up automatically			1
friday ’s trip to @entity83 , however , will go a long way to determining their fate in that respect			0
@entity8 said : ‘ we want more than the play - offs and the players showed that here			1
they were amazing in the first half			0
but this game demanded a lot of us mentally			0
we have to be ready for @entity83 now , it is another huge game			0
’ @entity0 , with 17 , has now scored more league goals in one season than any other @entity4 player has achieved in the last 25 years			1
the 21 - year - old makes no secret of his desire to one day return to @entity2 and challenge for a starting jersey			1
@entity8 , though , could well be using his friendship with @entity108 to secure another loan stay should they join the @entity111 in the @entity3			2
‘ for me , he is the best young player in the league			0
he is scoring goals and is showing he is mature , not just on the pitch but also in the changing - room , ’ added the former @entity113 assistant			2
@entity4 were good value for this win – @entity7 boss @entity120 called them ‘ ruthless ’ - and they were ahead inside three minutes			1
@entity45 loaded a ball forward from deep and @entity0 gave chase			1
his presence was enough to unsettle dithering centre - back @entity51 and the forward stole in before squaring for the unmarked @entity19 who rolled home for his eighth of the season			2
@entity0 celebrates with @entity19 after he teed up the @entity130 for @entity4 's early opener the goal owed everything to @entity0 ’s endeavour and he soon had one of his own on 11 minutes			1
@entity137 fed over-lapping right - back @entity29 and he drove into the area before locating the feet of his @entity2 team - mate			1
@entity0 took one touch to fashion a yard for the shot before swivelling and smashing beyond @entity48 from eight yards			1
it was a classy finish and added to the dossier of evidence which suggests there is a first - team future at @entity149			2
@entity0 neatly finishes @entity4 's second to put the home side in cruise control early in the first half @entity0 is mobbed by his team - mates including former @entity155 international @entity30 ( left ) @entity4 continued to pour forward and @entity36 came within a stroke of paint of netting a late goal - of - the - season contender			1
weaving between two visiting shirts 25 yards from goal , the @entity159 unleashed a rising drive which cracked the underside of @entity165 ’s crossbar			0
as if @entity7 ’ task was n’t stiff enough , they should have been reduced to 10 men when @entity51 hauled down @entity0 as he skipped clear on goal			1
that the offence occurred some 40 yards out perhaps spared him red			0
@entity4 now have three matches to play as they chase automatic promotion to the @entity3 @entity4 april 17 : @entity83 ( a ) , april 25 : @entity173 ( a ) , may 2 : @entity174 ( @entity175 )			1
wolves april 18 : @entity177 ( @entity175 ) , april 25 : @entity178 ( a ) , may 2 : @entity179 ( @entity175 )			0
the front - running @entity29 was n’t letting up with his offensive intent and another forward burst presented a chance for @entity19 , the @entity130 prodding over from 12 yards moments after the restart for the second half			2
wolves had offered little at the other end of the park but a swift break brought them to within one on 53 minutes			0
@entity60 galloped through the middle and slipped a pass to @entity59 who smashed between @entity28 and his near post			0
and they should have been level when @entity54 steamed onto @entity53 ’s deep centre and rattled the crossbar with a first - time volley			0
@entity4 , though , held on			2
one down , three to go			0
@entity7 winger @entity59 salutes the travelling support after his goal gave @entity120 's side hope			2

@entity4 secure @entity206 play - off place with win over @entity7
@entity2 loanee @entity0 scores one and sets one up
@entity4 one point off automatic promotion with three matches to play
