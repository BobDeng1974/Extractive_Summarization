she 's famous for her love of horses and skiing but it seems @entity5 is n't quite so adept when it comes to bows and arrows			1
during a visit to a @entity11 rehabilitation centre , she tried her hand at wheelchair archery - but managed to miss every time			1
with barely any shots on target , the @entity5 was left chuckling ruefully as the top scoring servicemen and women being treated at the centre looked on			2
@entity22 is the birthplace of @entity28 @entity27 sport , with the rehabilitation centre launched by neurologist sir @entity30 in 1943			1
@entity31 , who arrived in @entity28 as a penniless @entity33 refugee fleeing @entity34 , was convinced that sport was key to recovery and his championing of wheelchair sports not only reaped dividends for patient care , it also led to the creation of the @entity27			1
the stadium , which was built on the site of @entity31 's original treatment centre , was opened by the @entity45 in 2003 and has since been visited by all senior members of the royal family			0
@entity5 herself was there to launch the stadium 's @entity50 , which recognises those who have made an ' extraordinary contribution ' to @entity28 wheelchair sport			1
@entity55 away ! @entity5 lets fly with an arrow but things do n't go quite as she had hoped ... missed it ! the royal claps her hand to her mouth in dismay before offering watchers a rueful smile a long standing supporter of charities dedicated to disability , along with @entity68 , which runs @entity24 , she is also patron of @entity69 , which funds therapy for youngsters with physical difficulties , the @entity73 and @entity74			1
speaking about the visit , @entity68 chairman @entity75 said : ' we are delighted to welcome the @entity5 to this special occasion at @entity24			1
' the @entity50 is an honour exclusively reserved for the top contributors to @entity28 wheelchair sport both past and present			2
' the current names on the board have not only made remarkable achievements on a personal level , they have inspired and facilitated disabled people all over the country to take up sport			2
cuddle : last week saw her cuddle up to three - month - old @entity91 during a visit to @entity93 cheers : @entity5 also travelled to @entity95 where she was met by children from a local primary school ' the latest additions to the @entity50 are all individuals that have dedicated much of their lives to wheelchair sport and their contribution has been invaluable and their names have become synomonous with @entity24 and the birthplace of the @entity27 movement			1
' @entity5 's visit to @entity22 has come at the end of a busy month of engagements , including one in @entity109 that saw her delight a wheelchair - bound boy when she gave him a hug			1
she also joined in the fun at a musical playgroup in @entity93 and spent much of the visit playing with a group of excited toddlers			2
more is to come , with the countess scheduled to attend receptions on behalf of the @entity120 and @entity121 tomorrow , followed by trips to @entity123 and @entity124			0
her husband , @entity125 , also has plenty in his diary , starting with trips to @entity129 and @entity130 tomorrow and friday			0
clearly still revelling in the extraordinary success of the first ever @entity133 , prince @entity131 paid tribute to the men and women who took part at the @entity138 last night			0
in a speech recorded for the show , he said ' to fight for your country takes courage but to move beyond life changing injuries takes an extraordinary level of grit and determination ' before speaking of his admiration for those who managed it			0
the 30 - year - old continued : ' i can only begin to imagine how challenging the journey to recovery is but the admiration i have for these men and women is limitless			0
' using the power of sport to enhance recovery , the @entity133 showed how those who have been wounded should be recognised for their achievements post injury , rather than by being defined for their limitations post-injury			0
' the @entity133 shone a spotlight on the unconquerable spirit of servicemen and women and their families			0
' their stories move , inspire and humble me			0
they are as amazing as they are unique and i 'm absolutely delighted that the team is recieving this @entity138			0
