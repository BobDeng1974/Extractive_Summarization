@entity0 was facing a ferocious @entity2 backlash last night following a botched attempt to cosy up to @entity6 ’s @entity5 newspaper			1
the @entity2 leader , who boasted of standing up to mr @entity6 during the phone hacking scandal , attempted to mend fences in the run - up to the next election by posing with a @entity13 souvenir edition of the tabloid			1
but the picture provoked anger among @entity2 activists , particularly in @entity18 , where the newspaper is boycotted due to its coverage of the 1989 @entity22 disaster			1
backlash : @entity0 faced fierce criticism in @entity18 for his @entity5 stunt mr @entity0 was forced to issue a humiliating apology yesterday , saying he was ‘ very , very sorry ’ for causing offence			1
the apology came on a torrid day for the @entity29 on which he was attacked from all sides of the party over his ‘ disastrous ’ immigration policy and ‘ divisive ’ slogans , and a close aide warned that @entity2 was struggling for credibility			1
his latest problems began when he was pictured holding a special edition of @entity5 that was sent to millions of homes free to mark the start of the @entity13 despite his apology , the storm showed no sign of dying down last night , with one @entity2 councillor in @entity18 quitting the party and local mps warning mr @entity0 he was wrong to have even considered the stunt			1
@entity18 councillor @entity48 @entity49 and @entity50 posed for similar pictures and also faced criticism , but the most hostile response was reserved for mr @entity0 , who was accused of betrayal			1
@entity18 councillor @entity48 quit the party , saying : ‘ @entity56 promoting @entity5 has rocked me to my core			1
’ the city ’s @entity2 mayor , @entity58 , said : ‘ for the leader of the @entity2 to make such an offensive gesture insults not only me but every person in the city			2
‘ this is just another example of how out of touch the politicians in their ivory towers are from the lives of ordinary people			0
’ @entity71 mp @entity70 said he welcomed the apology but that mr @entity0 should not have allowed himself to be pictured with the newspaper in the first place			1
even members of @entity2 ’s front bench team were critical			0
shadow health minister @entity77 welcomed his apology , but her notably unsympathetic statement read : ‘ when asked to pose for a picture to support the @entity82 football team at the @entity13 , mr @entity0 agreed			1
’ shadow justice secretary @entity84 admitted that @entity2 was struggling to persuade voters its policies are ¿ credible ' in a frank interview in a statement yesterday , a @entity2 spokesman insisted that mr @entity0 had not meant to cause offence			1
‘ @entity0 was promoting @entity82 ’s bid to win the @entity13 and is proud to do so , ’ a spokesman said			1
‘ but he understands the anger that is felt towards @entity5 over @entity22 by many people and he is sorry to those who feel offended			2
’ the apology capped a dismal day for the party leader			0
his new slogan ‘ @entity98 ’ was condemned as ‘ divisive ’ at a meeting of @entity2 ’s ruling national @entity100 ( @entity101 )			0
@entity101 member @entity102 said a poll she conducted of more than 200 party members found that 98 per cent ‘ hated ’ it because it appeared to criticise the unemployed			0
she said activists described the slogan as ‘ divisive , meaningless ’ and ‘ sounding like a @entity109 slogan ’			0
on immigration , senior @entity2 mp @entity110 said that the ‘ metropolitan elite ’ had no idea about its impact on the lives of ordinary people			0
he accused @entity0 and other members of the leadership of living ‘ different lives to the voters whose support they need ’			0
he said the @entity2 leadership was ‘ reluctant to recognise the downsides ’ of mass immigration			0
the mp for @entity127 , in @entity128 , insisted he was not a ‘ plotter ’ seeking to dislodge mr @entity0			2
but he said the leader ’s ‘ hands - off ’ approach to dealing with the threat posed by @entity133 in last month ’s elections was ‘ an unmitigated disaster ’			0
and he warned that without a tough new immigration policy , @entity2 would continue to haemorrhage votes to @entity133 at next year ’s general election			2
in a further blow , one of mr @entity0 ’s closest allies warned that voters ‘ just do n’t believe what we say ’			2
in a frank interview , shadow justice secretary @entity84 admitted that @entity2 was struggling to persuade voters its policies are ‘ credible ’			0
‘ the public just do n’t believe what we say , ’ mr @entity84 , a close friend of the @entity2 leader , told the @entity150 website			2
‘ the challenge for all politicians is to persuade the public that politics can make such a positive difference			0
‘ the issue is n’t so much , “ should we have more policies on housing ? ” , it ’s persuading the public that the policies we have are credible and can be delivered			0
