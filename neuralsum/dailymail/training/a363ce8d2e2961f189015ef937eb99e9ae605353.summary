remedy : a glass of low - fat or fat - free milk every day could dramatically lower osteoarthritis in women 's knees a glass of milk a day could help stop women 's knees from creaking , claim researchers			1
a new @entity12 study found women who frequently drink fat - free or low - fat milk may have less osteoarthritis in the knee			1
but eating cheese increased the problem in women			1
drinking milk made little difference in men , and eating yogurt did not affect progression in men or women			1
osteoarthritis ( @entity26 ) is a degenerative joint disease that causes pain and swelling of joints in the hand , hips , or knee			0
lead author dr @entity34 , from @entity35 in @entity36 , said ' milk consumption plays an important role in bone health			1
' our study is the largest study to investigate the impact of dairy intake in the progression of knee oa			0
' more than six million people in the @entity47 have osteoarthritis in one or both knees including a fifth of people in their 50s and half of people aged over 80 , according to the charity @entity55			2
@entity26 , the most common form of the join disease , is more common in women than in men and more than one million adults per year consult their gp due to the disease			2
when doctors assess the severity of osteoarthritis , they use imaging studies to quantify joint damage by measuring the space that exists between the bones of a joint			0
narrowing joint space indicates cartilage loss and worsening osteoarthritis			0
at the start of the study dietary data was collected and joint space width was measured using x-rays , says a report in the journal @entity81			0
ladies only : the study found men do not enjoy the same benefits as women do from a glass of milk a total of 888 men and 1,260 women with knee arthritis took part who had follow - up checks up to four years later			1
as the intake of milk increased per 8 - ounce glass , the amount of joint damage in women fell			1
although all the women experienced some narrowing of joint space , it was least evident in women drinking more milk			2
when women went from drinking no milk , to less than 3 glasses , from four to six glasses , and more than seven glasses per week , the joint space width in women decreased by 0.38mm , 0.29mm , 0.29mm and 0.26mm respectively			2
there was a slight worsening of the condition among women eating cheese every day			0
yoghurt : the study at @entity35 in @entity36 found yoghurt has no effect for either sex results persisted even after allowing for disease severity , body mass index ( @entity119 ) and dietary factors			1
milk consumption improved knee joint health in men only at high intakes			0
' our findings indicate that women who frequently drink milk may reduce the progression of @entity26 ' said dr @entity34			0
' further study of milk intake and delay in @entity26 progression are needed			0
' he said it was unclear why milk helped women , it may be due to boosting calcium levels as women often have low intakes or as part of a healthy diet it could help combat obesity			1
drs @entity147 and @entity149 , from @entity151 - affiliated @entity150 , in a commentary said it was the ' first evidence ' that increasing milk consumption may slow the progression of the condition .			0
