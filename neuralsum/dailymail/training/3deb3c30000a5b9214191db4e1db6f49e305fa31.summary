@entity1 drugs company @entity0 walked away from tabling a new £ 70billion deal for @entity4 rival @entity3 yesterday , just two hours before the takeover deadline			1
the viagra - maker , which has been stalking its prey for months , has been persistently rebuffed by @entity3 , whose boss @entity8 argues the business has ‘ attractive prospects ’ and is better off on its own			2
@entity0 is now blocked from making a renewed assault on @entity13 for six months , but @entity15 experts believe @entity0 is likely to return as soon as this cooling off period expires			0
withdrawn : @entity1 drugs giant @entity0 today officially withdrew from its attempt to take over @entity3 ( @entity20 office pictured ) after the @entity4 - based group repeatedly spurned its advances the proposed £ 55 - a - share takeover would have been the largest ever of a @entity4 firm by a foreign company			1
driving @entity0 ’s ambition was a complex ‘ tax inversion ’ plan that would have seen the @entity1 company switch its domicile to @entity4 , slashing the firm ’s tax bill			2
the deal was criticised by scientists , investors and mps amid fears it could lead to job losses in the crucial life sciences industry			0
@entity3 is now under pressure from shareholders - several of which wanted @entity13 to talk to @entity0 about a deal – to show it can prosper as an independent business			1
@entity0 said in a statement : ' on 18 may 2014 , @entity0 announced that it had made a final proposal to @entity3 to make an offer to combine the two companies			1
following the @entity3 board 's rejection of the proposal , @entity0 announces that it does not intend to make an offer for @entity3			1
' @entity53 , chairman and chief executive of @entity0 , said : ' we continue to believe that our final proposal was compelling and represented full value for @entity3 based on the information that was available to us			2
' as we said from the start , the pursuit of this transaction was a potential enhancement to our existing strategy			0
we will continue our focus on the execution of our plans , bringing forth new treatments to meet patients ' needs and remaining responsible stewards of our shareholders ' capital			0
' @entity3 last week rejected an improved final offer of £ 69 billion from @entity75 maker @entity0 as at least £ 5 billion too low			1
in charge : @entity77 , chairman of @entity3 , said the firm will continue to build momentum as an independent company that was regarded as putting an end to weeks of intensifying rhetoric over a possible deal ahead of a deadline today , amid increasing concern over the impact of likely cost - cutting on @entity4 jobs and the country 's science base			1
the rejection met with discontent from some institutional shareholders , though others supported it			0
the takeover attempt was formally launched by @entity0 at the end of last month , but hostility to the proposed deal included criticism in some quarters of plans for the newly - merged drugs giant to be redomiciled for tax purposes in the @entity4 while retaining headquarters in @entity107			1
and the @entity1 drugs giant faced a fierce grilling by mps in which its @entity112 - born chief executive , @entity53 , admitted jobs were likely to be slashed			2
many in @entity116 are still furious at @entity0 three years after the firm closed its world - leading research plant in @entity120 , @entity122 - the site where @entity75 was invented			0
although some jobs were later saved , the 1,500 - job cull spelled an end to the careers of many leading scientists			0
@entity77 , chairman of @entity3 , said : ' we note @entity0 's confirmation that it no longer intends to make an offer for @entity3			1
' we welcome the opportunity to continue building on the momentum we have already demonstrated as an independent company			0
' we are fully focused on the delivery of our strategy			0
we have attractive growth prospects and a rapidly progressing pipeline			0
' in the coming months , we anticipate positive newsflow across our core therapeutic areas , which underpins our confidence in the long - term prospects of the business			0
' he said the board was grateful to chief executive @entity8 , his management team and to all the company 's employees for their dedication and focus over a period of uncertainty			0
@entity0 had promised to safeguard @entity4 jobs in a takeover , but unions dismissed the promise as ' worthless ' november 2013 : @entity1 pharmaceutical giant @entity0 approaches @entity4 rival @entity3 for first time , and the two firms ' senior directors agree to have an initial meeting in january april 28 , 2014 : the @entity1 firm publicly admits for the first time that it has made an offer for its @entity4 rival			1
an initial bid of £ 58.7billion had been made in january but was rebuffed clash : @entity0 boss @entity53 after a grilling by mps may 2 : @entity0 sweetens the deal , upping the offer to £ 63billion			1
chief executive @entity53 writes to @entity171 promising to keep jobs in @entity4 - an offer scorned by unions			2
@entity3 - whose shares have already risen to record levels - rejects the bid after just four hours may 4 : labour leader @entity179 accuses the prime minister of ' cheerleading ' for the takeover and orders for it to be halted may 6 : business secretary @entity185 warns politicians are powerless to stop the takeover because @entity4 laws are not robust enough to intervene			1
questions are raised over @entity0 's tax status as it emerges the firm paid £ 118million in corporation tax between 2010 and 2012 – but received a whopping £ 184million in tax credits may 10 : the @entity195 and @entity196 unions announce a mass campaign to block to the bid in the same vein as the campaign against @entity202 's takeover by @entity203 may 13 : @entity0 's boss faces a grilling by mps in which he admits jobs would likely be slashed			1
at the same time @entity3 claims vital cancer drugs could be under threat from the takeover may 18 : @entity3 rejects a ' final ' £ 69.3billion takeover bid , sending its own share price plummeting may 26 , 5pm : deadline for @entity0 to make another final firm offer for @entity3 or declare its intent not to do so			1

anger : mps were furious when @entity0 closed its top research plant three years ago in @entity120 , @entity122 mr @entity77 said : ' @entity3 has a culture of innovation , with science at the heart of everything we do			2
' i believe this will create significant value for our shareholders , employees and patients who will benefit from our life - changing medicines			0
' @entity234 , assistant general secretary of the union @entity195 , said : ' @entity0 failed to convince hardly anyone that their bid was good for science and would secure skilled jobs and manufacturing in the @entity4			2
' there can be no room for complacency though			0
we expect that there will be renewed pressure on shareholders over the coming months with the likelihood that @entity0 could be back in its attempts to take over @entity3			2
' the government needs to use this time to intervene and put a public interest test in place for proposed takeovers of this size , just as other governments do , such as the @entity257 , which has strengthened its powers to act to protect strategic industries			0
' @entity3 's workforce expects shareholders to stand firm , respect their responsibilities and back the board 's long - term strategy			0
' the future of vital life sciences in the @entity4 and improvements in health are so much more important than the desire of one company to minimise its tax liabilities and wrangles over drug patents			0
' this is why we urge the government to act responsibly and put in place a framework for a public interest test should @entity0 come back for @entity3			2
' @entity0 said the new company would have its headquarters in @entity107 but would have their tax base in @entity4 @entity280 : 1849 in @entity281 , @entity107 , by cousins @entity283 and @entity284 @entity285 : @entity107 @entity286 : 78,000 revenues last year : £ 30.6billion notable @entity287 : the firm invented @entity75 , the ' blue pill ' which has been vital to millions of men around the world controversy : closed vast research plant in @entity120 , @entity122 , three years ago with the loss of more than 1,500 jobs to local outrage @entity280 : 1999 through merger of @entity297 ( @entity298 ) and @entity299 ( @entity4 ) @entity285 : @entity300 , @entity301 @entity286 : 51,500 revenues last year : £ 15.3billion notable @entity287 : the firm is developing experimental new cancer drugs which it claimed could be under threat from takeover controversy : closed down the @entity307 research site in @entity308 last year , which employed 2,900 people including world experts			1
