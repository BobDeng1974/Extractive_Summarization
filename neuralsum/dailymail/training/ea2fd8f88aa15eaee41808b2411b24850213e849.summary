by @entity0 @entity1 is employing hundreds of staff on controversial ‘ zero - hour ’ contracts , it was revealed yesterday			0
around 350 temporary employees are given no guaranteed income under the deal , and can not work elsewhere without permission			1
use of the contracts has become widespread despite calls for them to be banned			1
it has emerged that employees at other national institutions – including cafe workers at the @entity17 art galleries and 3,700 staff at the @entity19 – are also on the deals , meaning that workers at many of @entity24 ’s grandest stately homes are not guaranteed a single hour ’s paid employment			1
popular : people queue every year to enter @entity1 for its annual @entity27 , but it emerged today temporary staff are on controversial zero - hours contracts exhibition : this year @entity33 's @entity32 and @entity34 will be shown to the public to celebrate the 60th anniversary of @entity33 's @entity37 the contracts have proved popular with employers as they do not set a minimum number of hours that have to be worked , allowing firms to draft in extra staff at short notice during busy periods			2
annual event : the @entity33 's @entity48 home is opened every summer and is run by the @entity1 subsidiary the @entity49 but trade unions have warned that some employers have used them to deny basic rights to workers			1
those employed under the contracts say they do not know if or when they will be working from one week to the next , making family and childcare commitments impossible			0
@entity1 uses the contracts for temporary staff working in its shop and the @entity64 during the summer			2
a spokesman for the @entity49 , which employs the temporary workforce , denied that the deal equated to a zero - hour contract			0
she conceded that employees were not guaranteed work but said rotas were issued around a month in advance , meaning workers could plan around their hours			1
a copy of a staff contract from 2009 stated : ‘ your hours of work will be advised by the visitor manager and will be dependent upon the requirements for retail assistants at @entity1 as and when required			2
’ the @entity82 argues that because staff receive advance notice of their working hours and benefits , including free lunches and holiday pay , they are not on zero - hour deals			1
those working for longer than three months are eligible for sick pay , with pension entitlements starting after six months			0
rooms like this banquet hall in the @entity1 are monitored by some staff who are not guaranteed to be paid in their contracts argument : @entity82 , which has some buildings and grounds open each summer , said today these are not zero - hours deals although there are not hours set out on the contracts at the @entity19 , the majority of seasonal staff are employed on zero - hour contracts			1
a spokesman said they were offered the same job security , pay and benefits as any other employee who had worked the same amount of time for the trust and managers are urged to set rotas well in advance			0
‘ our properties have told us it is important to be able to reorganise rotas quickly to respond to the weather and zero - hour contracts allow us to do that , ’ he said			0
uncertainty : some 90 per cent of workers at 396 stores are now on zero - hour contracts with the company catering staff at the @entity17 galleries in @entity48 , @entity131 and @entity132 in @entity133 are on similar deals			1
a spokesman for @entity136 said it did not prevent the contracted employees from working elsewhere			0
earlier this week it was revealed that 20,000 staff at @entity141 , which is controlled by founder @entity142 , were also employed under the same practice			0
the government is reviewing their use			0
deputy prime minister @entity146 said they could ‘ cause intense anxiety and insecurity ’ .			2

around 350 temps do *n't* get guaranteed hours or holiday pay
work in shop , meet visitors and monitor rooms at summer opening
there are calls for the deals to be banned because they *favour* employer
@entity146 warns of ' unacceptable uncertainty ' for workers
