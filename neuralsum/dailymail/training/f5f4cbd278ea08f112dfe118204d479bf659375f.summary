disturbing footage of a mother koala and her joey plummeting to the ground as their tree is bulldozed by loggers has revealed the grim fate that could face thousands more as plantations continue to be cleared at record speed			1
the marsupials were spotted clinging onto a tree at an @entity14 @entity13 ( @entity15 ) in @entity16 in south west @entity17 by a distressed local mother and her daughter who filmed the incident			1
@entity22 's spokesperson @entity21 told @entity23 that they have since chosen to remain anonymous after being abused for confronting those involved			1
while the mother koala has been reported to have survived the fall , mr @entity21 said the woman who filmed the ordeal returned to the same area the next day to find three other injured koalas			1
' it is believed that it was a mother and her joey			2
i 've heard that the animal survived the fall but there are still concerns from the footage takers that it could be injured and they do n't know what happened to the baby , ' he said			1
' the person that took the footage went back to the site a day later and found three very sick and injured koalas - one had to be euthanized because it had maggots in it			1
' there would have been a wound in the animal that became infected and flies have moved in and laid eggs , then the maggots hatch and start eating into the wound			0
' they have chosen to remain anonymous after allegedly being verbally abused and threatened by the plantation workers @entity80 spokesperson @entity79 said : ' we do have some people in the area who are monitoring that koala , she has scurried up another tree and rather than stress her any more we are just monitoring her from a distance and hopefully she 'll be ok ' @entity23 has contacted @entity15 for comment			1
their website states that it is ' committed to the hardwood plantation industry 's ultimate goal of zero harm to koalas ' mr @entity21 explained that most plantation companies had ' spotters ' that walk ahead of the machinery , whose operators can only see ahead , and try to spot koalas before their tree is cut down			2
' in this instance , someone was n't doing their job properly , ' he said			0
' @entity105 offers koalas protection in @entity17 and we think it has been breached in this instance and we will be talking to lawyers in the next day or two about what our options are			1
' this sentiment was repeated by @entity80 spokesperson @entity79 , who told @entity113 that authorities were monitoring the koala mother that was filmed falling alongside her home			1
' we do have some people in the area who are monitoring that koala , she has scurried up another tree and rather than stress her any more we are just monitoring her from a distance and hopefully she 'll be ok , ' ms @entity79 said			2
' we would like to see these people prosecuted – this is cruelty			0
' tens of thousands of hectares of blue gum trees have been planted in the region as part of the plantation in the last 15 to 20 years , according to mr @entity21			2
the woman who filmed the incident returned to the site the next day where she found three other injured koalas , one of which had an infested wound and had to be euthanized ( pictured ) ' there would have been a wound in the animal that became infected and flies have moved in and laid eggs , then the maggots hatch and start eating into the wound ' due to a lack of alternative native forest , hundreds of koalas are believed to have moved in and now call it home			1
but as loggers start removing the trees , mr @entity21 has predicted a ' koala blood bath '			0
' according to top koala expert @entity154 , he estimates that on the most nutrient rich soils we could be looking at a koala on each hectare – that 's a lot of animals , ' he said			0
' not all of the plantations would be that high , but we imagine that 80 per cent of the plantations would have koala activity			0
' now the plantations are being cut , they 're being logged at a great rate			0
there are more blue gums being harvested than ever before , so the impact on the animal is going to be severe			0

@entity23 has contacted @entity15 for comment			0
their website states that it is ' committed to the hardwood plantation industry 's ultimate goal of zero harm to koalas ' in june , a post to their website said that ' significant improvements ' had been made to its koala management and protection program over the previous six @entity186 are listed as having independent koala spotters and the implementation of new technologies and work practices			1
in an ideal world , companies would perform a population assessment in their plantations before the logging begins and if animal numbers are high , the area is not cut down until the animals have moved on			0
' i do n't think population surveys are being done by this company - i think they 're meant to leave a few trees standing if they spot a koala and just log around it , ' mr @entity21 said			2
' what we need is corridors and linkage inside the plantation so companies need to dedicate a large proportion of their land to rehabilitate native forests within their @entity216 will provide safe movement within and beyond the plantation boundary for koalas			2
' there needs to be approved relocation programs that identify suitable habitats , and there needs to be designated exclusion zones			0
' all tree felling should cease within a two - tree distance of any koala observed and should not resume until it has moved on or been relocated			0
they need to train koala spotters and have rescue kits and people who are capable of handling and processing koalas who are also linked with vets and trained to treat injured koalas			1

a distressed local mother and daughter *captured* the moment on camera at an @entity14 @entity243 in @entity16 in south west @entity17
they have chosen to remain anonymous after being allegedly verbally abused and threatened by the workers

activists are looking to take legal action against the company
