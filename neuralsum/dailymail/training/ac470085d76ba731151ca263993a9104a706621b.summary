the slow pace of the inquiry , its cautious preliminary conclusion and the fact that wreckage and human remains are still lying in @entity5 frustrated and angered victims ' families			2
' well , i do n't know what to say about this , ' said @entity147 , a @entity148 mother who lost two sons , 11 - year - old @entity150 and 19 - year - old @entity151 , in the crash			1

@entity199 , chairman of the @entity22 that is leading the international investigation , acknowledged the preliminary report - mandated by international aviation guidelines - did not shed much new light on the downing of the @entity43			1
' perhaps you could say we are a little bit behind , but we are not behind with the truth			0
we try to make a report that 's for the next of kin - very important - but also for history , ' he said			2
' i understand a lot of people say , ` why do n't they work a little quicker ? ' but this will take its time , ' he added			0
pro-russian rebels officially deny having shot down the plane , but unofficially one senior rebel admitted they were behind a missile strike			2

@entity263 , a former @entity93 @entity264 commander and the chairman of the public council of the @entity93 @entity267 ( @entity267 ) , declared : ' i was totally shocked by the data published by the investigative commission			0
' did it take them so long to find out that the @entity43 was in good repair ? it was clear from the start there would be no claims against the airplane 's serviceability			0
' he said accusingly : ' the @entity148 is careless , it draws conclusions before examining the plane 's debris and body fragments			0
' meanwhile , rebel official in @entity195 , @entity286 , told @entity287 alleged that the downing the the plane was ' a provocation carried out by the @entity262 armed forces in order to discredit @entity93 and the people 's militia '			0

in a statement , the board 's chairman @entity199 said : ' the initial results of the investigation point toward an external cause of the @entity1 crash			1
' more research will be necessary to determine the cause with greater precision			0
the @entity22 believes that additional evidence will become available for investigation in the period ahead			2

the cockpit voice recorder ' revealed no signs of any technical faults or an emergency situation , ' the @entity22 said			0
' neither were any warning tones heard in the cockpit that might have pointed to technical problems			0

' @entity389 army personnel carry a coffin to a hearse during the arrival ceremony of @entity1 victims at the @entity394 in @entity395 , @entity191 , today ' it must have been moving at very high velocity to create the damage , ' he said			2
' it could only be a missile of the type that would reach the altitude that would have struck the aircraft			2
' he said the report gave no indication whether the missile had been fired from the ground or from another aircraft , but it likely came from the ground as there were no military aircraft known to have been flying at the time			2
the missile could not have been shoulder - fired because it would not have reached the necessary altitude , @entity117 added			0
