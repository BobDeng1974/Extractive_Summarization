this video - entitled ‘ @entity0 bought his daughter a @entity3 ’ - has done nothing to enhance the reputation of women drivers in @entity7			1
apparently leaked by an insurance industry source , it shows a spectacular crash as a new owner - perhaps on her first outing with a gleaming black 4x4 - reverses , cautiously , from her parking place			1
abruptly , she speeds up , ramming a bush and sinking into a ditch at the side of the road , flipping the expensive new suv onto its roof			2
gently does it : the owner of this gleaming new suv at first slowly and cautiously reverses from the space jump : it seems the driver 's foot has slipped on the accelerator somewhat , causing the vehicle to jerk back oh dear : the car , said to be a brand new @entity31 , sinks into an unfortunately located ditch disaster : the vehicle rolls over onto its roof			2
the driver was said to have been saved from harm by the airbags @entity41 user @entity39 uploaded the 16 - second footage stating : ' the video was filmed by cctv camera			0
i was given it by a friend who deals with car insurance			1
' the @entity3 was brand new			0
they did n’t even take the factory ’s protective covers from inside the car			0
' the car was driven by a young woman			1
she was n’t hurt thanks to the airbags			0
' the female driver was not identified , nor was the location in @entity7 where the accident happened			1
the @entity3 was believed to be a present from her wealthy father			0

a voice on the video - believed to have been re-recorded from a security camera - says ' no way ...			0
. ' - as the action unfolds			0
comments to the video - which has gone viral on the @entity7 web - include such observations as : ' no matter what you ’ve got under your bum , @entity3 or @entity71 , you ’ve got to keep your brain in gear too			1
' some were laced with sexism about female drivers , such as : ' women have no place in such vehicles			1
' ' this indulgent father bought her a luxury motor - but he should have made sure she had a driving licence before she drove it , ' said one commenter			0
' i think it was extremely lucky that she tested her driving skills in a quiet yard , did n’t injure herself and did n’t get other drivers or pedestrians hurt			2
imagine her in the middle of a busy motorway , ' said another			0
yet another complained : ' why oh why are inexperienced drivers like this getting heavy cars like that ? '			2
