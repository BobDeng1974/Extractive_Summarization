@entity0 will be restored to the national curriculum as schools are ordered to teach children about @entity5 ’s history			1
the national curriculum for history , to be published by education secretary @entity8 next week , will give all children aged seven to 14 a clear narrative of the major events between the @entity11 and the present day			1
the document , seen by the @entity13 , will state clearly that every pupil must ‘ know and understand the history of these islands as a coherent , chronological narrative , from the earliest times to the present day ’			1
@entity5 institutions : figures such as @entity21 and @entity0 will be reinstated onto the history syllabus , which will be published next week			1
@entity5 history will take a more prominent role on the curriculum mr @entity8 is insisting that pupils learn about leading historical figures such as @entity21 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity31 @entity30			1
pupils aged 11 to 14 will also be expected to study ‘ the @entity34 and the wartime leadership of @entity0 ’ , the only modern politician who is mentioned			0
he was banished from the curriculum in 1999			0
the current national curriculum , last updated by @entity38 in 2007 , leaves big gaps in pupils ’ knowledge and ditched the learning of significant dates and events in favour of focusing on historical themes			1
but the new curriculum makes @entity5 history the centrepiece of the curriculum , rather than , for example , the heavy emphasis on the @entity52			1
it also calls for pupils to study ‘ how people ’s lives have shaped this nation and how @entity5 has influenced and been influenced by the wider world ’			2
that will involve study of @entity62 subjects such as ancient @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity66 civilisation , rather than the primary focus being on @entity69 history as at present			2
earlier this year , mr @entity8 said he was worried that the curriculum and exams system ‘ mean that children thirsting to know more about our past leave school woefully undernourished ’			0
a senior @entity76 source said : ‘ @entity77 will learn a coherent chronological story of @entity5 history instead of @entity38 ’s dumbed - down curriculum that leaves pupils with big gaps in basic knowledge			1
they will learn about major global phenomena such as classical @entity86 , the @entity87 , and the @entity88 , and about @entity62 civilisations such as @entity63			0
’ the @entity8 ’s first attempt to rewrite the curriculum in february was condemned as too prescriptive by left - wing academics			0
he has compromised by leaving teachers some freedom to decide precisely what to teach			0
but he has stuck to his guns by ordering them to follow clear chronology			0
professor @entity99 , the senior history professor at @entity100 , who helped draw up the curriculum , said : ‘ it is very important that we understand our national history as part of being an active citizen			2
‘ you ca n’t debate our sense of national identity and our national interest unless you understand our national history			0
this curriculum puts @entity5 history first as well , which i think is right			2
‘ it kicks out the woolly empathy in favour of giving children more of a sense of where we are at that moment between the past and the future			0

new curriculum published next week will cover major events from the bronze age to the present day
new syllabus says pupils need a chronological narrative of @entity5 *'s* history
