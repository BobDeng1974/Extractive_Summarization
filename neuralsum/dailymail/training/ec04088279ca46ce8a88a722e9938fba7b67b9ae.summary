a prolific @entity1 anti-vaccine campaigner who will be speaking at child health seminars across @entity3 has defended them after pro-immunisation parents labelled them as ' disgusting '			1
@entity7 , who has written books such as saying no to @entity9 and @entity10 and flu vaccines : what 's coming through that needle ? , will be touring in @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , the @entity17 and @entity18 in february and march			1
but pro-vaccination campaigners have hit out at the @entity20 , and @entity22 seminars			2
' i planned to be in @entity3 for a holiday and was asked to speak with a few groups who are interested in discussing the pros and cons of vaccines , ' she told @entity36 via email			2
' it is curious why the public health , pro-vaccine community is so outraged over my visit and the opportunity to share information sourced from conventional medical journals			1
' if vaccines were so effective , so protective and so incredibly safe , no one would be interested in these gatherings			2
' the public health community should be willing to openly discuss they problems associated with vaccines , how to improve vaccine safety , and how to restore the health of those who have been vaccine - injured			1
' as soon as next month , @entity56 will also get the chance to sit down and have dinner with the high - profile anti-vaccination campaigner , with tickets ranging from $ 125 to $ 200			0
dr @entity7 described the public the public health and pro-vaccine communities ' outrage as ' curious ' her views on immunisation are further demonstrated by the t - shirts sold on her site on her website , dr @entity7 writes she believes ' vaccines can cause more harm to the health of the individual ' and is against ' a system that forces parents to inject their children , against their better judgment '			1
her views on immunisation are further demonstrated by the t - shirts sold on her site , which read : ' i did n't deny my children vaccines ... i spared them ' and ' fact : 1 in 50 = @entity85 , fact : 1 in 25,000 = unvaccinated , @entity83 '			1
but dr @entity7 's visit have people so outraged they have vowed to write to local politicians to stop her from spreading her message , with @entity90 the @entity91 - a group who are for vaccines - leading the charge			1
stop the @entity91 's @entity95 told @entity36 the group 's concern was dr @entity7 ' peddled misinformation '			1
' she ’s giving information that 's not supported by evidence and marketing it to people with alternative views and possibly leaving them in danger by not vaccinating their young children , ' he said			2
dr @entity95 - who has a phd in hiv research - said it was also concerning that people who were joining dr @entity7 , like @entity109 , were spruiking homeopathic vaccines , which are ' essentially water '			1
' the evidence shows they do n’t work … and leaves their kids susceptible , ' dr @entity95 said			2
' recently a seven - month - old child who was not vaccinated died from whooping cough			0
' one of @entity90 the @entity91 's supporters wrote on social media she was going to write to federal politicians asking for their intervention			0
' i 'm writing to the @entity125 @entity124 and @entity126 ( health minister and assistant health minister )			2
vaccines are recommended by every state body in @entity3			0
they are incentivised by our federal govt , ' one woman said on @entity135			0
people have taken to social media to express their outrage , with one pro-vaccine group starting a letter writing campaign the seminars are called raising @entity143 , and will be held in @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity3 and @entity146 while others have expressed their disgust on the social media pages of the venues holding the seminars			1
' i am beyond disgusted that you are hosting an anti vaccination seminar in march ... children die each year in this country as a result of this misinformation , is the small amount of money you are going to get ... worth it ? ' a @entity135 user wrote on @entity14 's @entity162			1
another wrote : ' can not believe you are hosting an anti vaccine seminar in march , disgusting			0
never staying here , ever			0
' this comes after the @entity168 ruled against @entity169 , finding homeopathic vaccines were not scientifically proven to be effective , and said the health website had mislead people into thinking they could be used as a substitute for medical vaccines , @entity166 reported			2
@entity175 of @entity176 and surveillance director @entity177 told @entity36 dr @entity7 was tapping into people 's ' fear factor '			1
' when we 've got no disease to see , it 's very easy to look at something like autism - unfortunately it 's something we still do n't understand - and start to suggest it has something to do with being vaccinated			0
you can understand why people would believe that , ' he said			0
' but there are hundreds of studies that disprove that			0
' professor @entity194 added there was no scientific evidence homeopathic vaccinations protected people against infectious diseases			0
he said it was like asking someone if they wanted to be vaccinated with ' sterile water '			0
' it ’s just laughable really , ' professor @entity194 said .			0
