@entity0 rammed some of the ridiculous criticism he has received in recent weeks from @entity4 supporters back down their throats with a first half double and the perfect goal celebration			1
the former @entity8 forward who scored 22 goals in 44 games in his first season at the club including strikes that won the @entity15 and @entity17 final has had to put up with whistles in his own stadium and a fan poll that had 40 per cent of supporters calling for him to be dropped in recent weeks			0
when he put @entity4 ahead on 18 minutes in the 2 - 0 win over @entity24 on sunday night he made sure he left off some steam , covering his ears as he ran to the corner to give the flag a celebratory kick			1
read back over @entity31 's live coverage here			0
host commentator thanks for following @entity31 's live coverage of @entity4 's 2 - 0 win over @entity24			1
big week of football coming up , starting with @entity36 vs @entity37 - stick with @entity38 for all the updates			0
a drab second half is brought to the end by the referee			0
if only @entity43 had netted that ridiculous flick , eh ? anyway , @entity0 's seven - game run without scoring is over and he looks ready for next week 's @entity47 , even if @entity48 was a bit out of sorts			1
@entity4 move to within a point of @entity52 , and they are nine goals behind the @entity55 club in terms of goal difference			1
yeah , he 's not scoring today			0
@entity59 puts in a cross , @entity0 slicks it on and @entity48 shins the ball wide			1
@entity48 elects to allow someone else to take a free - kick			1
this time it 's @entity59 , he whips it in and it finds @entity69 but he wastes a header wide of the post			0
oh , and @entity69 was just one of four @entity4 players offside - the linesman spots it			1
seconds later @entity76 flashes a shot well over the bar from the edge of the area , not that that statement will surprise @entity37 fans			0
it 's a yellow card for the @entity87			0
@entity48 still looking for that elusive goal , he cuts in from the left along the edge of the area , past two markers and fires in the shot but it 's straight at goalkeeper @entity96			1
another change , @entity43 gets a bit of a rest towards the end - with most people still gutted not to see his wondergoal effort go it - and is replaced by @entity69			1
give the maestro a rest before @entity47 next week ... @entity106 comes off after completing 77 minutes and is replaced by @entity107			0
he might be the best player in the world but @entity48 is taking a bit of a liberty here			1
first the lack of respect to @entity0 in the first half , and now he 's running around demanding the ball			1
he gets it from @entity116 and then just loses the ball on the edge of the box			0
obviously frustrated and not one for defensive responsibility , he stands with his hands on his hips			0
@entity123 off , @entity85 on			0
@entity43 plays in @entity0 and he fires at goal			1
@entity96 saves well but it escapes his grasp and @entity116 almost reaches it to tap in but the goalkeeper eventually gathers			0
there 's four forwards for @entity4 on the pitch now - looks like they 're going to go with @entity48 and @entity43 up front as a pair , @entity116 on the left and @entity0 on the right as an extremely attacking front through			1
wow ! how do you describe that ? @entity48 crosses from the right and @entity43 is completely unmarked			1
with the ball coming slightly behind him and around his midriff , he lifts his right heel and directs the ball on to the angle of post and crossbar			0
so close to a crazy goal			0
absolute class and so , so ridiculous			0
hopefully that will wake up this otherwise drab half			0
@entity151 ( yes , the @entity152 one ) and @entity153 replace @entity154 and @entity155 for @entity24			1
not much going on so far but @entity43 fires over a half - volley seven minutes after the break			1
@entity4 could do with a few more , they 're nine goals behind @entity52 on the goal difference tally			2
can @entity48 get himself a goal ? and will @entity0 get his hat - trick ? we 'll find out in the next 45 minutes at the @entity163			1
the @entity163 crowd might be a bit more pleased with @entity0 , but team - mate ronaldo certainly is n't			2
the @entity168 forward effectively set up the @entity169 for both goals , albeit unintentionally , and was not best pleased			0
first , his acrobatic volley was cleared and @entity0 smashed in the rebound , with @entity48 raising his arm in frustration even as @entity0 netted			1
second , @entity0 deflected in @entity48 's shot , which was heading wide , to make it 2 - 0 , and the @entity177 looked far from pleased , and it 's not something that 's gone unnoticed			1
two @entity0 goals - the second to the frustration of @entity48 - and they 're 2 - 0 up			1
@entity183 has been a spectator in goal			0
that 's real sure of the win			0
a quick free - kick by @entity106 plays @entity189 in down the right , he cuts back to @entity48 who fires a shot across goal			2
it - decisively - deflects in off @entity0 and @entity4 are 2 - 0 up			1
@entity48 celebrates the strike but we 're crediting that one to @entity0			1
he 's on a hat - trick now , unless the @entity177 winner has a word at half - time			0
@entity201 cuts in from the left and tries to fire in a shot but it 's blocked at close range			0
real break but @entity43 makes a wrong pas and the @entity163 begins to boo			2
no pleasing these guys is there ? they 've done next to nothing so far but @entity24 are trying to play a bit , but there 's just no intensity to their play @entity154 does well down the left but he ca n't get past his man and @entity4 recover and are free to build up again			1
moments later they look close to finding a gap in the @entity4 defence but @entity220 does well to clear away			2
@entity0 cuts back in from the right wing and it hits the chest of @entity224 to deflect on to the crossbar - not sure if the @entity169 was aiming for a shot or cross but he 's come close nonetheless			2
@entity0 also gets to the subsequent corner first but heads over			2
it 's @entity4 's 10th shot of the game ( @entity24 have had none ) and @entity48 almost makes it 2 - 0 to his side			1
he looks set for a tap - in in front of goal after @entity0 plays the ball across the six - yard line but @entity238 manages to get in with a last - ditch block to save @entity24			1
@entity0 might have had the chance to silence his critics but @entity242 is n't quite so lucky as he sits on the bench			2
the @entity4 captain got a less - than - warm reception from the crowd when his name was announced pre-match , as you can hear here : @entity0 runs towards the @entity163 crowd with his hands to his ears			1
where are the boos now ? after @entity48 's acrobatic volley was headed off the line , @entity0 slams in with a right - footed volley			1
it 's 1 - 0 and @entity0 has his goal			2
@entity96 's having to be everywhere right now , although he probably knew it would be a busy night			0
this time it 's @entity0 with the effort , he gets up to head @entity106 's corner goal - wards but the keeper makes a stunning diving save to keep it goalless			2
@entity43 has the ball in the net after he latches on to @entity96 's save from @entity270 's long shot , but the @entity271 is ruled offside by the linesman			2
@entity48 is brought down 25 yards out and wins a free - kick			2
six player wall ... can he test @entity96 ? no. ... it 's hit the six - man wall			0
here we go with another long - winded @entity4 attack			2
real not really breaking through their opponents in the last couple of minutes but they are well in control			0
@entity24 are effectively an eight - man defence and as soon as they break into the opposition half they give the ball away			2
lovely flick from @entity0 over to @entity43 who cuts back to @entity48 inside the box and he toe - pokes it towards the corner ... but it hits the base of @entity96 's post			1
a goal is n't far away			0
first chance for @entity0 to show what he can do			2
decent early chance as he turns and volleys towards goal which arrows just wide of the top corner			0
we 're underway at the @entity301			2
before kick - off , a moment 's reflection for former @entity4 player @entity304 who passed away today aged 78			0
it 's bad enough having to play away against @entity4 , but @entity24 have a dreadful record here and will likely just be hoping not to be on the end of a rout			1
the reverse fixture back in october ended 5 - 0 to @entity4 , with @entity48 scoring twice , and their past record at the @entity163 makes grim reading too , looking from now back to 2008 their form here reads : 3 - 0 , 5 - 1 , 4 - 2 , 2 - 0 , 8 - 0 ( yes , eight ) , 5 - 2			1
@entity0 has no goals in his last nine games , so tonight is a big for him to change the fans ' perceptions			0
remember , we 're only one week away from the big one : @entity47			0
it 's vital @entity4 stay in touch			0
all the action here in 10 minutes			0
the big news for @entity4 is that their famous front three of @entity43 , @entity48 and @entity0 all start - while @entity328 is rested			1
oh , and of course @entity242 is dropped for @entity331 - although that seemed to be hinted by @entity135 on saturday			0
here 's the rest of their line - up plus the @entity336 : @entity4 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity183 ; @entity189 , @entity220 , @entity84 , @entity59 ; @entity106 , @entity337 , @entity338 ; @entity0 , @entity43 , @entity48			1
@entity24 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity96 ; @entity339 , @entity340 , @entity341 , @entity238 ; @entity342 , @entity224 ; @entity155 , @entity343 , @entity201 ; @entity123 .			0

@entity48 , @entity0 and @entity43 all start
@entity0 was defended from criticism this week by @entity349
