leader @entity9 's party is likely to win the contest , which she hopes will cool political tensions without the need for her to bow to demonstrator 's demands for leadership change			1
however activists say they will not participate in another ballot , and insist that @entity9 must leave office before they stop the rallies which brought 140,000 people onto the streets today			1

the unrest has brought parts of @entity3 to a standstill as the yellow shirts push for revolution the yellow shirts are opposed to another election which will favour the current government protests began after @entity9 tried to pass an amnesty bill , seen by critics as a way to bring @entity34 back @entity34 is in exile to avoid jail for a corruption sentence which he claims was politically motivated experts have predicted more violence if the yellow shirts are successful as the red shirts are likely to protest pro-thaksin parties have won every election in more than a decade , while the opposition @entity136 - whose mps resigned en masse sunday - has not won an elected majority in about two decades			1
the protest started after @entity9 tried to pass an amnesty bill which critics of the government saw as paving the way for @entity34 's return			2
the conflict has pitted the middle classes , the royalist elite , and the military - known as ' yellow shirts ' - on one side , against working class ' red shirts ' and supporters of @entity34 on the other			0
' if this government is deposed , it will be an outcome of a so - called ' people 's coup ' by the electoral minority , ' said @entity4 expert @entity161			0
dozens of red shirts were killed in a crackdown while demonstrating against the last government parts of the city centre have been virtually closed down by protesters as they march down the highways while most of the demonstrations have been peaceful a few have turned violent the country has been in political turmoil since 2006 when there was a military coup the violence had only a brief respite last week when both sides paused to celebrate the birthday of the nation 's revered king , who turned 86 on thursday ' we will see more polarisation - and the makings of a prolonged civil conflict , ' added @entity186 , director of the @entity188 at @entity3 's @entity189			2
dozens of people were killed in a military crackdown on mass @entity195 @entity194 rallies in @entity3 three years ago against the previous government			0
if @entity9 is overthrown , ' we will see most likely the return of the @entity199 to @entity3 and when they unleash their wrath this time it will be much more cataclysmic than what we saw in the uprising in 2009 - 2010 , ' @entity197 added .			0
