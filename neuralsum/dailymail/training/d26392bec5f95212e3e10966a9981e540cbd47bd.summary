by @entity0 published : 06:58 est , 23 july 2013 updated : 05:13 est , 24 july 2013 a council has come under fire after placing fines on gravestones because mourners ' floral tributes breached regulations on pot plants			1
several visitors to @entity10 in @entity11 found letters from @entity13 stating they had to pay for a garden permit because they had placed more than one pot plant at a gravestone			1
@entity18 , 37 , was tending to her grandmother 's grave when she discovered the @entity22 sized notice , which said she must pay £ 87 because she had more than the one pot plant allowed under council regulations			1
shocked : @entity18 , 37 , found a notice on her grandmother 's grave , pictured at @entity10 in @entity11 , which told her she would have to buy a plant permit if she wanted more than one pot by the gravestone mrs day , from @entity10 , @entity11 , said : ' i ca n't stop crying			1
it 's a special place and i feel it has been violated			2
' i was so upset when i came across and found it on there			2
she lived in @entity10 all her life			1
i 'm very angry - it 's disgusting			2
' i do n't want it to look just like a bit of grass in a field			0
i should n't have to pay to keep it looking nice			2
not everybody can afford to pay			2
' the only thing we are allowed by the council , unless you pay £ 87 pounds , is a headstone and one pot plant			1
' we already pay a fortune for the plot - i paid more than £ 700			2
why should we have to pay again just for keeping it as a nice memorial ? ' the mother - of - two , whose grandmother @entity56 passed away in 2011 at the age of 79 following kidney problems , added : ' she would have been 81 today			2
appalled : @entity18 pictured holding up the council notice workers left on her grandmother 's grave ' i just think it is wrong			1
i do n't think there is any need			0
we 've put our own topsoil on there			0
what is wrong with the graves looking like that ? there 's a lot of us that are quite angry			0
' the council needs to be a little more thoughtful to us paying our respects			0
it 's just a job to them but it 's not to us			0
' people to come and remember people			0
we are trying to make it a nice place where people want to come and visit			0
' it takes time and it takes money that people wo n't have			0
' @entity88 , 33 , was forced to pay an £ 87 charge to place more than one pot plant at the grave of her seven - year - old daughter , who died from a brain tumour in 2010			1
mrs @entity88 , from @entity94 , @entity11 , said : ' i arrived to see my daughters grave and from the car could see something had been left on the stone			1
' i presumed it would be something nice but as i walked over i saw it was a notice telling me the grave did not comply with cemetery rules			1
charge : ms day will have to pay the council £ 87 for permission to have more than one plant at her grandmother 's grave at a time ' i was completely devastated			1
whoever put it there surely still has humanity			0
they could see my daughters face in the tributes			0
' several mourners with family members buried at the cemetery are setting up a petition to call on the council to scrap the charge , which is enforced when families want to plant flowers and shrubs on graves			1
the fines started appearing on the graves last month			0
@entity130 , assistant director of landscaping services at @entity13 , said plots at @entity134 cemetery cost £ 525 , with garden permits costing £ 52 or £ 87 depending on the plot size			1
he added : ' the fee is levied as when someone puts a garden it makes it more difficult for the area to be maintained , and it increases the council 's maintenance costs so it is a one off fee that we charge			2
' you ca n't simply mow up and down rows when there are gardens there			0
' the notice is relatively discreet			0
it is only an @entity155 notice saying the garden does not comply with standards and to call the officer to discuss it further			0
' justified : @entity13 said the charge is necessary because plant pots make maintenance more difficult and raise the costs			1

notices were left on headstones around @entity10 in @entity11 telling mourners they need a permit to have more than one plant at a grave
@entity18 , 37 , found a notice on her grandmother 's headstone
it said she must pay £ 87 for a permit if she wanted more than one plant
@entity13 said potted plants increase cost of maintenance at the cemetery so the charges are necessary
