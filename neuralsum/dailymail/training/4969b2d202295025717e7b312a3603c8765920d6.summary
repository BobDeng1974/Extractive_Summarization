by @entity0 @entity1 , 14 , died in hospital after he was misdiagnosed with a urinary tract infection a schoolboy died on @entity5 after twice being misdiagnosed by out - of - hours stand - in doctors , an inquest has heard			1
@entity1 , 14 , died in hospital after he collapsed at home the day after he spent @entity10 with his family			1
medics working at an out - of - hours gp service wrongly put his symptoms down to a urinary infection , an inquest in @entity13 was told			1
but the young boy was actually suffering from deadly peritonitis , an inflamation of the abdominal lining which was brought about by appendicitis , a coroner heard			1
his mother , @entity25 , had taken her son to @entity27 , an out - of - hours gp service based at @entity29 , @entity13 , on december 22 , last year , the court heard			1
the teenager had severe learning difficulties , was unable to speak and had the mental age of a two - year - old			2
he indicated that he had pain in his penis , and medics performed a urine test and concluded he had a urinary tract infection			1
he was then sent home with a course of antibiotics			2
on two occasions his mother then tried to take him to accident and emergency , but the boy refused to go			2
three days later - on christmas day - @entity1 was taken back into the @entity27 service because he was still unwell			1
ms @entity25 told dr @entity47 that her son had a temperature , was not eating and was still complaining of pain			0
he had also been sick			0
the doctor told the hearing in @entity52 , @entity13 , that @entity1 was alert and walked normally into the treatment room			1
he said that during an examination of @entity1 ’s abdomen it felt soft and appeared non-tender			1
the inquest heard that the schoolboy had also improved somewhat on the antibiotics he had been prescribed on the earlier visit			0
the appearance of the child ’s urine and a dipstick test led dr @entity47 to also believe he still had a urine infection			0
he prescribed stronger antibiotics and told ms @entity25 to take her son to see her gp on december 27 and bring him back if he did n’t improve			0
senior coroner for @entity13 and @entity70 , @entity71 , asked the @entity68 if the symptoms did not hint at something more serious			0
' urine tract infections can cause people to feel very unwell and can be more serious			0
they can be really nasty , ' he said			0
but the young boy was actually suffering from deadly peritonitis , an inflamation of the abdominal lining which was brought about by appendicitis , a coroner heard , and he later died at @entity84 the doctor explained that diagnosing appendicitis in a child with severe learning difficulties and who could not speak , would be difficult			1
the hearing was also told that @entity1 had an extremely high threshhold to pain			1
dr @entity47 said that he had no facilities to do blood tests but did not think @entity1 ’s condition warranted being admitted so one could take place			1
senior coroner mr @entity71 recorded a narrative verdict into @entity1 's death at @entity99			1
he said : ' the serious nature of the condition was not recognised which resulted in a lost opportunity to treat the condition ' the schoolboy was also not sent for a scan because the medic believed surgeons would have declined it because of @entity1 ’s presentation			1
on @entity1 went into his mother ’s room and was playing on a phone while she had a shower when he collapsed			1
he was rushed to the @entity114 in @entity115 , where he died			0
@entity1 , from @entity116 , @entity13 was described as a happy child who was always smiling and loved school			2
@entity119 is inflammation of the peritoneum , the thin layer of tissue that lines the inside of the abdomen , and it is caused by an infection , which can rapidly spread around the body			2
@entity119 is regarded a medical emergency and requires immediate treatment			0
it is often the result of infection or injury to another part of the body , such as a split stomach ulcer , a burst appendix , or digestive disorders , such as @entity141 's disease or diverticulitis			0
symptoms include sudden abdominal pain that becomes more severe , nausea , a lack of appetite , and trouble passing urine			2
a post mortem examination concluded that he died as a result of peritonitis and appendicitis			1
the pathologist told the coroner that @entity1 ’s ability to explain his symptoms would have been compromised by his learning difficulties			1
no evidence of a urine tract infection was found in the post mortem examination			0
dr @entity163 , a director at @entity27 , carried out an internal review into @entity1 ’s death			2
he said the red herring which threw the two doctors off was the urine test			0
' the post mortem offered no clear explanation of the horrible red herring that threw the doctor ’s off the true diagnosis and i fear it may remain something of a mystery			0
' he said that the batch of urine tests was checked and nothing was found wrong with them			0
senior coroner mr @entity71 recorded a narrative verdict into @entity1 ’s death			2
' the serious nature of the condition was not recognised which resulted in a lost opportunity to treat the condition , ' he said			0
' in 2014 somebody does not die of peritonitis and i looked at this matter in great detail			0
yet it seems due to the red herrings - his high pain thresh - hold and the urine tract infection - simply misled those caring for him			2
' i do question whether people with severe learning difficulties should be accessed in hospital rather than in a walk - in out - of - hours services			1
' speaking to ms @entity25 and @entity1 ’s father , @entity201 , mr @entity71 added : ' he was a very courageous young man and the memory of @entity1 will last a very long time			1
' speaking after the hearing @entity1 ’s cousin , @entity203 , said he felt like the misdiagnosis was being ' swept under the carpet			2
' ' i ’m not sure who is to blame , but somebody should be held accountable , ' he said			0
' i think he should have been admitted to hospital for further tests			0
' if he had been seen by somebody who knows about his condition in a hospital , then maybe he would still be here			0
