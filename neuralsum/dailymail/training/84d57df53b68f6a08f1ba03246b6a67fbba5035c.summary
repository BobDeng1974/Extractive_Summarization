by @entity0 this is the dramatic moment that a 15 - year - old girl feared she would die after being sucked waist - deep into the mud during a stroll with friends			1
@entity7 student @entity6 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , who has asked us not to use her surname , spent more than an hour trapped in @entity13 in @entity9 after veering from stable ground while out for a walk			1
she and her friends first laughed off the experience but soon panicked when they could n't pull her out of the cold ground - and the teenager began to fear for her life			1
without anything to hold on to , the teenager sunk into the ground she said : ' i was terrified , thought i ’d never get out			2
at first my friends were laughing , but after an hour i still could n’t get out so they decided to call the fire brigade			1
' i thought they might send three firemen , but about 20 people turned up , fire engine , paramedics			2
the police ... it ’s not what i expected			0
' @entity6 walked on the ground , which looked solid but she was quickly sucked below in to her waist with nothing to hold on to			1
the mud was so thick that her friends were unable to help her out			0
@entity6 , who wanted to send a warning out to other walkers , has heaped praise on the rescuers who saved her on sunday			2
she said : ' i would just say to people to check the ground before you walk on it , because it might look safer than it is			0
' i do n’t want to stop people going up there at all , it ’s a beautiful place , but just be a bit careful			0
warning : @entity6 has told other walkers to pay extra attention to where they are walking , saying that the ground might look more stable than it is			1
@entity6 was rescued by 20 firefighters an hour after she became stuck ' i was lucky my friends had their phones with them , but i have seen people on their own			1
if you do n’t have a phone to call for help you ’d be in trouble			0
' i ’d like to thank all the firemen and the paramedics and the policewoman who drove me home afterwards			0
' @entity8 fire crew manager @entity73 , who helped in the rescue , said : ' where this incident was , the water rises rapidly - we have seen it at 20ft			0
hidden dangers : @entity13 in @entity9 , where @entity6 was sucked into the mud			1
a firefighter involved in the rescue said that the incident could have been much worse as the water level can rise to 20ft ' we hope speaking to people in the area and prominently displaying warning posters , more people will be aware of the hidden dangers and that we can prevent any further incidents like we had on sunday			0
' we managed to get the girl out quickly , but she was up to her waist in mud and the water was very cold , so it could have been a far more serious outcome			0
' @entity6 ’s mum praised the firefighters , adding : ' nothing like this has ever happened , it was horrifying			2
