i 'm not a fan of 3 - 5 - 2 because the centre - backs are the free men and they become the safe option			2
' they play out from the back but the tempo is too slow			2
far too often they are keeping possession and passing it backwards			0
' they 've become quite predictable in the past few weeks			0
@entity2 looked far more dangerous on saturday when they changed the system			2
