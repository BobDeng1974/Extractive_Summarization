@entity1 defender @entity0 has admitted that @entity2 could make his life a nightmare as @entity5 chase down a 2 - 0 @entity7 deficit in the @entity8 tomorrow night			1
@entity5 arrived in @entity9 this afternoon with a mountain to climb after losing their last sixteen first leg clash at the @entity12 three weeks ago			1
but former @entity13 player @entity0 told a press conference at @entity1 ’s training ground this lunchtime that his international team mate @entity2 could change things round in tomorrow ’s second leg if he is given the chance			1
' he is a great player and if he is given space he can be a nightmare to play against			2
' we will try and give him as little space as possible as the last thing we want is for him to be comfortable			0
we need to make things uncomfortable for him			0
' i think we will see a very attacking @entity5 team			1
they always attack but the result from the first leg means that they will throw even more players forward			1
' we will try to dominate the possession			0
that ’s the only way to play against really good teams			2
' few people give @entity5 much chance of overturning the result from the first leg , even if @entity1 are getting it in the neck from their critics in @entity9 after a weekend defeat at @entity68 saw the slip to third place in @entity71			1
one questioner asked @entity0 how @entity1 had gone ' from the fairy house to the monster house ' in recent weeks while another accused the players of not training hard enough			1
he said : ' tomorrow is a different thing			0
it is the @entity7 and the team has to go out there on the pitch and play as we usually do			2
' i believe in what i do and what i see and , at the end of the day , i do n’t know who said we are n’t training hard enough because we are the ones who are really training and working hard			0
' this team and group , we have made this profession dignified			0
i can look straight into your eyes and say we do things well			0
nice shorts : @entity97 dons some small shorts and high socks in training something to smile about : @entity33 was in high spirits as the @entity1 stars were put through their paces ' we can not play as we did against @entity68 , but we can get back to winning and our best form and tomorrow is a good chance to do that			1
' right now , it is march and we have two months to end the season by doing something special			0
' now is the time to press the accelerator and achieve our objectives			0
' one step away : @entity1 look likely to reach the quarter - finals of the @entity7 in training : @entity26 ( right ) and @entity33 prepare for the @entity5 clash in @entity1 @entity1 coach @entity23 has come under great pressure in recent days with people questioning his right to manage the club			1
@entity23 said : ' all i can do is be strong and be powerful			2
' we have lots of things to play for			2
we are still in three competitions and i have to be strong and try to get us back to how we were playing when we went to @entity5			1
' i need to be a leader			0
if i ’m not then i do n’t deserve to be a manager			0
' mission impossible ? @entity21 ( left ) and fit - again @entity2 ( right ) have a tough task ahead not again : @entity132 was sent off for hauling down @entity26 in the penalty area sucker punch : @entity26 netted from the sport but @entity136 ( right ) added a second late in the game			2
