if your daily commute ever seems like a drag , console yourself with the thought that it is making you younger			1
according to @entity6 ’s @entity5 , time slows down as we speed up – meaning @entity9 travellers , for example , age less quickly			1
the downside is that the effects are tiny – a typical commute turns back time by just a few millionths of a millionth of a second			1
getting younger on the move : tube travellers age less quickly , but the effects are tiny – a typical commute turns back time by just a few millionths of a millionth of a second even a tube driver would not earn back a whole second by the end of their career			1
physicist @entity28 , of @entity29 , said : ‘ time is n’t constant			1
the faster you travel , the slower the second hand ticks for you			1
both of them are given very accurate clocks			2
one twin is sent on a train that travels at incredible speeds			0
' @entity30 is n't constant ' : professor @entity28 was speaking at the @entity40 's conference in @entity41 ' the other remains at home , moving about at a speed far slower than the first twin			1
when the twin who travelled by train returns home , both twins compare the time on their clocks			2
less time will have passed for the twin who took the train , relative to the twin who stayed at home			2
’ professor @entity28 told the @entity40 ’s conference in @entity41 , @entity57 , yesterday that such insights would help ordinary people appreciate the beauty of physics			0
and he pointed out that @entity9 travellers may not realise that they become lighter when taking the lift up from platform level			0
‘ you have weight because gravity is pulling you down , ’ said the professor			0
‘ so when you are in a lift and you are being accelerated upwards , you are lighter because you are working against gravity			0
’ another of professor @entity28 ’s 12 insights was that @entity9 escalators are made of stardust – because almost everything on @entity76 is made up of elements formed billions of years ago at the heart of a star			0
spewed out into space when the star died , they eventually pulled together to make planets , people - and escalator materials			0
professor @entity28 has launched the @entity87 project to try to popularise the subject .			0

@entity6 's @entity5 states time falls in speed as we get faster
but a commute turns back time by millionths of a millionth of a second
even a tube driver would not earn back a second by end of their career
