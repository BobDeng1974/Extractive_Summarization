healthy gay men should be given anti-viral drugs to ' slash the number of cases of @entity5 ' , a groundbreaking new study has suggested			1
the @entity7 study , conducted in @entity8 , provides the first evidence that preventative @entity5 treatment is highly effective in a real - world setting			1
it showed that pre-exposure to the @entity5 drug @entity15 can reduce the risk of infection in men - who - have - sex - with - men ( @entity20 ) by as much as 86 per cent			1
previous research had suggested that preventive treatment might cut hiv infection rates but it was unclear whether such an approach would work in practice			1
a new study , hailed a ' game - changer ' by experts , has found pre-exposure to @entity5 drugs in healthy gay men can reduce the risk of infection by as much as 86 per cent ( file image posed by models ) the new study recruited 545 participants at 13 sexual health clinics in @entity8			1
they were divided into two groups , one of which was to be given @entity15 immediately and the other a year later			1
comparing the two made it possible to assess the effectiveness of pre-exposure prophylaxis ( @entity43 ) in men at high risk of hiv infection			1
of the 276 men treated straight away , just three were infected with @entity5 over the subsequent year			2
during the same period , 19 of the men from the ' deferred group ' became @entity5 positive			2
chief investigator professor @entity50 , from the @entity52 's @entity51 at @entity53 , said : ' these results are extremely exciting and show @entity43 is highly effective at preventing hiv infection in the real world			1
' concerns that @entity43 would not work so well in the real world were unfounded			2
' these results show there is a need for @entity43 , and offer hope of reversing the epidemic among men who have sex with men in this country			1
' the findings we 've presented today are going to be invaluable in informing discussions about making @entity43 available through the @entity70			0
' dr @entity71 , medical director at the hiv / aids charity @entity73 , said : ' @entity43 is , quite simply , a game - changer			2
' we know that most gay men use condoms most of the time , and that this has prevented tens of thousands of hiv infections since the epidemic began in the @entity81			1
' however , we also know that condomless sex vastly increases the risk of @entity5 being transmitted			1
' this research shows just how effective @entity43 can be in preventing transmission of the virus in groups at greatest risk ; offering another line of defence alongside condoms and regular testing			2
' it is not a vaccine and it wo n't be for everyone , but once approved , we expect it to significantly increase the momentum in our fight against the virus			0
sexually active gay and bisexual men are at highest risk of hiv infection , pictured under the microscope			1
in 2013 , an estimated 2,800 new hiv infections occurred in men who have sex with men in the @entity81 ' we urge the @entity111 , @entity8 and local authorities to make @entity43 a key priority in the fight against @entity5			1
' the findings , presented at the @entity115 ( @entity115 ) in @entity116 , @entity117 , also showed that taking a drug to protect against @entity5 did not appear to alter rates of condom use			2
no significant impact was seen on levels of infection of other sexually transmitted infections ( @entity125 )			2
an aggressive new strain of @entity5 has been identified , scientists have warned			0
a new study found the strain , called @entity130 , is capable of transforming from an infection to full - blown aids within just three years			1
that is considerably faster than the average conversion time of around 10 years - and can be so quick that a person may not even realise they are infected			0
scientists were prompted to investigate after noting a growing number of reports of people in @entity141 suffering a rapid progression to @entity143 , within three years of infection			2
@entity5 tests often do not detect the virus within the first few weeks of infection , sometimes months			0
once a person develops the flu - like symptoms that characterise acute infection - usually coming two to four weeks after infection - the virus undergoes a latency period			0
during that time the virus replicates and lives inside the body , but does not cause any symptoms			0
that period can last between five and 10 years before @entity143 develops , in most cases			0
but researchers at the @entity160 in @entity161 noted the @entity130 strain causes patients to make the transition to @entity143 much faster			0
it can be so quick that a person may not even realise they are infected			0
@entity168 , chief executive of the @entity169 , said : ' the study shows two important things - one , that @entity43 is highly effective in preventing @entity5			0
' and two , that gay men wo n't just throw away the condoms as soon as they start taking @entity43 ( @entity125 were the same in men taking and not taking @entity43 )			0
' during the study period there were 19 hiv infections in the group not taking @entity43			2
' if we can stop people getting @entity5 by giving them @entity43 , we have an ethical duty to do so			0
' furthermore , over the course of their lifetime the treatment of those 19 men will cost the @entity70 nearly Â£ 7 million			2
' so the financial argument is clear , as is the ethical one			0
@entity43 needs to be available on the @entity70 as soon as possible for all those who need it			0
' @entity7 stands for @entity190 for reducing @entity5 in the @entity81 : immediate or @entity191			0
in october last year , an ethical decision was taken to offer men in the ' deferred group ' arm of the study @entity15 earlier than planned			1
this followed an interim analysis of the data that revealed the extent of the protection provided by prophylactic treatment			0
sexually active gay and bisexual men are the population group at highest risk of hiv infection			1
in 2013 , an estimated 2,800 new hiv infections occurred in @entity20 in the @entity81			0
dr @entity208 , head of infections and immunity at the @entity52 , which co-funded the study , said : ' @entity5 remains a serious public health concern - in 2013 alone , around 2,800 gay , bisexual and other men who have sex with men became infected			1
' so clearly , additional approaches are needed to tackle the @entity5 epidemic , particularly for populations at higher risk			0
' the @entity7 study addresses this very important issue and shows promising results that a relatively straightforward intervention based on existing therapy - @entity43 - could have a major impact in preventing hiv infection			1

pre-exposure to the drug @entity15 reduce risk of hiv infection in men who have sex with men by as much as 86 per cent , @entity229 study found
first study of its kind to show the treatment works in healthy people
previous research had indicated treatment such as this might cut hiv rates
but it was unclear whether such an approach would work in practice
