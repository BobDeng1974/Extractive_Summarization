disgraced former @entity1 gov. @entity0 made his final written plea to a federal appeals court wednesday , arguing that the favors he did for a wealthy businessman were routine courtesies and not part of a bribery scheme			2
the onetime rising @entity10 star made the argument in a 54 - page brief in the 4th @entity14 @entity13			0
a three - judge panel of the court will conduct a hearing on his appeal of his public corruption convictions on may 12			1
@entity0 was sentenced to two years in prison and his wife to one year and one day , but they remain free while they pursue separate appeals			1
' governor @entity0 never promised anything and never did anything besides extend to @entity35 the sorts of routine courtesies elected officials throughout the country extend to donors and benefactors every day , ' @entity0 's lawyers wrote in the latest filing			2
they were responding to the government 's brief urging the court to uphold the criminal convictions			0
former first lady @entity60 , left , was sentenced to a year and a day @entity36 ceo @entity35 testified under an immunity deal , admitting that he paid the governor with lavish perks in exchange for helping him secure university backing for his ' miracle cure ' @entity68 product prosecutors had written in a 93 - page submission to the court that @entity0 's actions fit the definition of ' official acts ' even better than those taken by former @entity77 rep. @entity76 , who is serving 13 years in prison for taking bribes in exchange for using his influence to broker business deals with government leaders in @entity84			1
@entity76 was famously caught with $ 100,000 in bribe money hidden in his freezer			0
' here , defendant directed his action toward subordinate state employees within the branch of government that he controlled as governor , ' they wrote , while in the @entity76 case ' a congressman took action through meetings , letters , and the like directed at other government agencies or foreign governments			0
' one of @entity0 's chief claims on appeal is that the favors he did for @entity35 did not amount to ' official acts ' covered by federal bribery law			1
in the new filing , he argues that a meeting @entity0 arranged for @entity35 with an administration official was ' innocuous ' and that there was nothing special about an event at the @entity111 to launch @entity36 's signature product , the anti-inflammatory @entity68			1
' governor @entity0 arrived late , made neutral comments , and left			0
he never asked anyone to do anything for @entity35 , ' the brief says			0
@entity36 , the maker of @entity68 , the anti-inflammatory supplement at the center of the @entity0 trial , halted sales of the product in august 2014 worse than the freezer bribes ? prosecutors argue @entity0 's behavior was a better fit with bribery laws than that of convicted former congressman @entity76 , who his $ 100,000 of his bribe cash in his freezer @entity0 argues that in addition to mischaracterizing such events as ' official acts , ' the government incorrectly suggested that @entity0 kept his staff in the dark about most of @entity35 ' gifts			1
among the gifts were almost $ 20,000 worth of designer clothing and accessories for @entity60 , vacations , golf outings and $ 15,000 for a daughter 's wedding			0
the former governor also renewed claims that the judge improperly denied separate trials for @entity0 and @entity60 and that he failed to adequately question jurors about pretrial news coverage			2
@entity35 , who was seeking state - financed research on @entity68 while lavishing the @entity152 with gifts and loans , testified under immunity for the prosecution .			2

@entity0 used his office to benefit a nutritional supplement company whose *president* lavished gifts on him and his wife
his lawyers argue that he never performed any ' official acts ' for @entity36 , a company that sought support for his ' @entity68 ' supplement
@entity0 was sentenced to two years in prison and his wife got one year and one day ; they *'re* both free *pending* appeals
three - judge federal court panel will hear the former governor 's appeal on may 12
