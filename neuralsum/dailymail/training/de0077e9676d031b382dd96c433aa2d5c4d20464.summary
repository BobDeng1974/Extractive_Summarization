not guilty : @entity0 pictured outside @entity1 after being cleared of rape on thursday @entity4 's former boyfriend today spoke out about the nine - month ordeal he suffered after being accused of raping a woman while she slept in his bed			1
@entity0 described his rape trial as being like a ' runaway train ' as he celebrated walking free from @entity1 when a jury acquitted him of all charges			1
a 27 - year - old friend of his had accused him of twice raping her at his flat in @entity14 , central @entity15 , in the early hours of @entity16 last year			1
the 35 - year - old film director - who was going out with @entity18 when she died in july last year - said the pair had consensual sex after a night out drinking together			1
the unnamed woman denied that she had consented , and accused @entity0 of saying , ' i 've always wanted to do this to you ' as he sexually assaulted her			1
hearing the verdicts , @entity0 closed his eyes and bowed his head			1
emerging from the dock , he thanked judge @entity29 and hugged his family and friends			2
leaving court he hit out at the authorities for not dropping the weak prosecution case , and said he hoped to fall in love again after losing @entity4 , thanking his current girlfriend , actress @entity36 , for supporting him during the trial			2
he said the ' nauseating ' trauma of the false allegations had compounded the grief he felt in the wake of the singer 's death : ' it has been a difficult 18 months , it 's been unreal in the true sense of the term			2
' speaking on the steps outside @entity1 , @entity0 said the police should have dropped the investigation after looking at @entity49 that contradicted her version of events			1
she told investigators she was so drunk she could not stand up , but footage showed her walking freely and unaided with mr @entity0 to get in a taxi to his flat			1
he said : ' i am really relieved , really relieved it 's all over			0
the last nine months or however long has been crazy			0
' it feels like anyone can make a complaint and end up having their day in court			0
being impartial , that 's fair enough and i think it is right			0
' i can understand why it 's like that but in reality a train starts running and in this case the person who made the complaint was n't investigated , the police did n't know anything about her			0
' lovers : the film director was dating @entity4 at the time of her death last year new girlfriend : @entity0 paid tribute to actress @entity36 , pictured hugging him above , for standing by him during the trial he added that he had always been confident that the police , @entity87 and judge did not believe he was guilty			1
calling for anonymity for those accused of sex crimes , he said : ' i definitely think in cases like this , no one believed it but my name was still associated with those headlines			1
' that 's going to be the case unless anonymity is given to the accused in cases like this			2
' @entity0 branded his accuser ' either mentally ill or evil ' and said he had not seen her since the night they had sex			1
his lawyer , @entity105 , said : ' it is an exceptional case and i do n't think in my career that i have defended a case where i have been so sure of my client 's innocence			0
' what is unbelievable is that if we had n't found them coming out of the club on that cctv , which the police had totally failed to identify , there was a real risk of a miscarriage of justice			0
' denial : @entity0 , pictured left , has always denied the rape allegation			1
after the verdict he said of new love @entity36 , right , that ' she has been a real strength throughout ' the director , who made the 2010 film @entity128 , featuring @entity130 star @entity129 and @entity132 singer @entity131 , was first arrested over the allegations in april			0
@entity0 , who had apparently planned to marry @entity4 before she tragically died , said he was ' completely and utterly flabbergasted ' by the claims and there was ' no question ' the attack happened			1
he even told the jury : ' i sort of came away from that evening thinking this could be really good , this could be the start of something			2
' i was n't looking for a girlfriend , but she is somebody i have known for a long time and that there could be something in this			0
' @entity1 had earlier heard how the pair had been out drinking in three @entity150 bars when they headed back to his flat in the early hours			2
free : @entity0 was said to be in mourning for @entity4 at the time of his encounter with the woman tributes : @entity0 standing outside @entity4 's home shortly after her death last july the woman claimed she was asleep in bed with mr @entity0 when she awoke to find him having sex with her			1
she said he stopped when she asked him what he was doing , but when she passed out again she woke up to him doing it a second time			0
the 27 - year - old also claimed that when she later got up to leave his home she could not find her underwear			2
when she asked @entity0 where they were he told her he wanted to keep them as a memento , she claimed			1
but @entity0 has always strongly maintained his innocence and told the court the woman was completely ' compos mentis ' when they had sex , and that it was in fact her who lured him into bed			1
he said they had both been ' merry drunk ' and had agreed she would stay at his as it was just round the corner which she was ' very happy to do so			2
' at around 4.30am @entity0 said he suggested they ' get their heads down ' and offered to sleep on the sofa while she slept in the bed but she told him to ' come and sleep in the bed ' and initiated sex			1
he told the court : ' she had a big smile on her face			0
she was being very inviting about me coming and getting into bed with her			0
' she was someone that i knew and trusted			0
if she did n't then i would just go to sleep			0
but pretty much straight away we started kissing and touching each other			0
' she was leading it just as much as i was following it			0
there was never any question she did not consent			0
' there is no truth in whatsoever in the allegations			0

woman claimed @entity0 attacked her after they had been drinking
but jury agreed with his defence that @entity16 sex was consensual
*filmmaker* argued he should have been given anonymity during trial
