thousands are planning to mark the occasion on wednesday by getting married			2
but one retired teacher in @entity10 is offering $ 1,112.13 to whoever can think of the most original way of commemorating the unique day			1
unique : this date will never happen again and the next ' sequential date ' will not occur for another 92 years @entity16 , who will be judging the competition , calls the date ' noughts and crosses day ' because of the pattern of consecutive numbers in a row			1
the 68 - year - old and his wife @entity23 , 51 , from @entity25 will be giving the cash prize to : ' the most consequential sequential celebration			1

you wait and wait for them , then they brighten up your day and poof - they 're gone			2
' some say the next @entity45 properly arrives on 1/1/1 , on the shoulders of the next century			0
' that day , however , seems to be booked ahead by @entity47 's			2
' if it 's three in a row as this , we wo n't see the like again until 1/2/3			0
sadly enough , that 's an 89 - year wait			0
' so if we 're judged technically wrong in our designation , we can still all enjoy our last hurrah - there wo n't be another @entity45 this century			0
' we are giving away the date in dollars but nobody gets a large chunk			2
we just like to see a lot of different people taking an interest in patterns in numbers			0
' the truth is we do n't get enough interest so anybody who enters will effectively be a winner			0
' we 're looking for more people to get involved			0
' we are hoping to get 36 entries altogether , and will be picking the winners at @entity47			0
winners also get a very handsome certificate			0
' the competition money comes out of what i do n't drink in coffee every year			0
' @entity78 purists say we are not being ' pure ' to maths , or call it " sandlot maths " , but i do n't care			0
' clearly , it 's not a day to quarrel - let 's celebrate ! ' they have offered a number of suggestions on their website , prompting entrants to write a poem , a story , host a ' glorious winter gathering ' or organise a festival of noughts and crosses			1

the next day of numerical significance is in nine years on november 22 , or 22/2/22			1

talking about odd day , @entity123 astrologer @entity122 said the numbers meant little in terms of astrology , but added : ‘ the calendar itself has thrown up a series of numbers that make us stop and consider			2
so we can interpret this date as having potential for positive change in our lives			2
’ in nine years : the next date of numerical significance is @entity137 - 22/2/22 or november 22 , 2012 rare : retired teacher @entity16 said dates such as wednesday are ' calender comets ' because they only come around so often			1
