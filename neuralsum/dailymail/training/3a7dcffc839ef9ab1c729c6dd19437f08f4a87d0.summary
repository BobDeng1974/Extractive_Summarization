squadron leader @entity7 plunged out of his blazing @entity9 bomber at 20,000ft and was horrified when he realised his parachute was n't strapped to his body			1
it was only when he hurtled for a split second through the bright beam of the @entity15 searchlight that he spotted it was on the end of a strap 10ft above him			2
@entity7 , pictured , was plunging 20,000ft from a burning @entity9 bomber during the @entity20 when he realised his parachute was not strapped to his body while still falling through the air in the dark , the 21 - year - old managed to rein the cord in until he was able to put the parachute on and pull the release cord in the nick of time			1
he landed heavily ten seconds later in a frozen field but escaped the 1944 near - death experience with just a dislocated shoulder			1
he was picked up by the @entity15 and taken to the infamous @entity33 camp just six weeks before the ' @entity35 ' attempt by nearly 100 @entity36			1
the incredible wartime story will be told for the first time 70 years on by @entity39 's son when he appears on @entity41 's @entity40 this weekend			1

' sgt @entity97 , flight engineer , undid the seat belt and attached a chest type parachute onto my harness			0
' a short while later the aircraft rolled onto its back and i fell onto the cockpit canopy , together with the flight engineer , which seemed to give way			0
' i found myself falling rapidly in the darkness at about 20,000ft			0
' it was cold and breathless , but i could still hear the noise of the bomber stream			0
judging by some revolving lights , i must have been in a tumble			0
' on reaching for the parachute ring , i discovered my pack had disappeared - no parachute ! i assumed it had been torn off			2
@entity7 , centre , with crew including ground crew			2
while he escaped with just a dislocated shoulder following his plunge from a burning @entity9 , five were killed as the bomber crashed down near @entity122 the final entry to squadron leader @entity7 's log book			1
a number of archives from the late pilot 's war time collection are due to appear on @entity40 while his son @entity130 is set to recount the incredible story ' somewhile later , against some light from searchlights , i saw the oblong shape of the parachute , unopened and still attached to the harness			1
' as soon as i saw this , i pulled it up / down / sideways and towards me then found the d ring and pulled , the parachute opened ! ' i landed heavily in a frozen ploughed field , on the outskirts of @entity69 , with a dislocated left shoulder			1
' @entity55 , 66 , said : ' my father later told me that he was probably falling through the air for about five minutes and pulled the parachute open 10 seconds before he hit the ground			2
' it was only because he went through the beam of the searchlight for a split second that he realised the parachute was still attached to him and he had the nowse to put it on despite free - falling to the ground			0
' he was very reluctant to talk about it , until the latter part of his life when i made him write down his experiences			0
' i think he probably just felt a degree of guilt about the loss of his crew when he survived			0
' up until now it has just been the family who knew about it			0
