@entity1 ’s largest airline is asking customers to fry with them as it becomes the latest carrier to use a mix of recycled cooking oil and jet fuel to power a long - distance flight			1
@entity8 is using the biofuel to drive the engines of an @entity12 aircraft on a nine - hour demonstration flight from @entity14 to @entity15 on tuesday			2
it will be the airline ’s inaugural transatlantic flight using a fuel mix containing the type of oil used to fry fish , chips or chicken			1
come fry with me : @entity8 is using recycled cooking oil to power a flight from @entity14 to @entity15 @entity8 said it will be able to reduce its net carbon dioxide emission by 50 to 80 per cent by switching to a more sustainable and environmentally - friendly fuel source			2
but biofuel is more than twice the price of conventionally produced jet fuel and it is too costly for any airline to operate with it exclusively			0
tuesday ’s flight coincides with the opening day of the @entity39 in @entity15			1
@entity40 , @entity8 ’s vice-president of sustainable development , said : ‘ the @entity39 is an important gathering to fight climate change , and we wanted to take this opportunity to highlight the climate benefits of more widespread adoption of environmentally sustainable biofuels in aviation			0
let 's fry away : @entity51 has been using cooking - oil - based fuel on flights in @entity54 since 2011 @entity8 's biofuel mixture is being provided by @entity56 , a joint venture between @entity56 and @entity58 , and is partly manufactured with cooking oil from restaurants			1
@entity8 is n’t breaking new ground with its @entity14 - to - @entity15 flight , however			0
it first flew with biofuel in 2011 and several airlines have been using the mixture for years			0
but @entity8 said it is hoping to establish a biofuel hub with its partners to develop the supply chain and lower the cost of sustainable biofuel while reducing its reliance on fossil fuels .			0
