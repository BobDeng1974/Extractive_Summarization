the infant had suffered a catalogue of injuries , including head wounds , lacerated liver , internal bleeding , fractured ribs , bite marks on her head and bleeding in her eyes , caused by shaking and striking			1
the court heard how @entity0 had been looking after her all day			2
when interviewed by police , he denied causing the fatal injuries but gave no explanation about how they were caused			0
he later claimed that @entity1 had fallen off the bed and hit her head while he was asleep			2
then on the day his trial was due to start in may , he produced a radically different account , accepting for the first time that he caused the injuries , the court heard			2
he said he had shaken his baby and thrown her on the bed and then from there she fell to the floor , the court heard			0
but the prosecutor said that @entity0 had still failed to account for all the injuries @entity1 suffered and there was no explanation for the bite marks on her forehead			1
however , an examination of one of the bite marks showed it matched the defendant 's teeth imprint , the court heard			0

he added : ' @entity1 was a helpless infant , entirely dependent upon the love and care of her parents			0
