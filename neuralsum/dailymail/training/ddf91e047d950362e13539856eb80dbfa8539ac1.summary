by @entity0 published : 06:46 est , 27 august 2013 updated : 09:31 est , 27 august 2013 when judge mrs justice @entity3 ruled that a disabled man could be sterilised last week , her controversial decision became a national talking point			1
but for @entity8 , 51 , the landmark ruling came as a welcome surprise			1
like the parents of the 37 - year - old man , @entity8 has fought long and hard to get a hysterectomy for her severely disabled daughter @entity13			1
and although it might sound cold - hearted , @entity8 , from @entity15 in @entity16 , insists that removing her daughter 's womb is the best thing for her - and will spare her pain			1
tragedy : @entity8 with her severely disabled daughter @entity13 , 21 , who has the mental age of a baby difficult : @entity8 says @entity13 goes through excruciating pain each month when her period begins in an interview with closer magazine , @entity8 explained that she has wanted a medical intervention for @entity13 , 21 , who has the mental age of a six - month - old , since she began her periods			1
@entity13 has severe cerebral palsy and can not walk , talk or feed herself			1
but despite her condition , @entity34 medical experts insist that a hysterectomy would n't be in @entity13 's best interests			0
' every month when @entity13 has her period , she screams and writhes in agony , ' explains her mother			1
@entity13 ca n't make choices in life , so why - as her mother who has cared for her for over 20 years - should that choice not be placed with me ? ' @entity13 's condition was caused by being starved at oxygen at birth and was diagnosed when she was just four months old			2
devastated , it took @entity8 months to recover although a local support group came to her aid			2
now in her 20s , @entity13 still has the mental age of a six - month - old baby but has come to enjoy the presence of horses and the sight of sensory lights			1
suffering : @entity13 , who has severe cerebral palsy , can not walk or talk and has the mental age of a six - month - old cause : @entity13 's condition was caused by being starved of oxygen at birth and was diagnosed at four months landmark : the ruling made by mrs justice @entity3 has inspired @entity8 , whose story appears in closer in 2005 , as puberty began , @entity8 got in touch with her gp to raise the possibility of sterilisation and was referred to a gynaecologist			1
but instead of a hysterectomy , the gynaecologist suggested the @entity76 or contraceptive injections instead - neither of which , @entity8 says , were suitable for @entity13			2
rejecting the gynaecologist 's advice , she battled on , taking her case to a succession of @entity34 boards , before the move was finally denied by a panel of doctors in 2008			0
' losing the case was heartbreaking , ' @entity8 told @entity66			0
' i could n't fathom why they could n't see how much @entity13 needed it			0
when they said it was against her human rights , i could have cried			0
' and then , her worst fears were realised			0
when @entity13 eventually began her periods at the age of 19 in 2011 , the effect was traumatic			0
according to her mother , she screamed and screamed and beyond giving @entity13 paracetamol , there was nothing @entity8 could do			2
now she hopes to take her daughter 's case to the @entity104 in the wake of the latest ruling - and hopes a similar verdict will result			2
' this ruling has given me hope that one day @entity13 will be able to have the operation , ' she says			0
' her condition is incurable , but if i could take away this pain once a month , i could finally feel like i was doing something to make her physically better			0
' read the full story in this week 's issue of @entity66 , out now			0
