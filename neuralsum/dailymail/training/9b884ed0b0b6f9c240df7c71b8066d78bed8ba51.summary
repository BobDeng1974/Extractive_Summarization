@entity0 is coming under fire from traditionalists with accusations its sets are reducing the scope for imagination and play			1
bloggers and parents have become increasingly alarmed that its kits , whether it is @entity11 or @entity12 , involve building a specific model , using specialist pieces according to strict instructions			1
they worry it takes away the pleasure and ambition involved in a child just sitting with a box of bricks and creating something from their own imagination			1
parents and bloggers complain that new @entity0 is not as good for children as the old fashioned plastic blocks the debate has been triggered by @entity32 blogger , @entity31 , who complained : ‘ the problem is sets that only make one thing like a dragon or something licensed from a movie			1
’ the it expert who was previously in the @entity40 said : ‘ i must have got my first @entity0 when i was about three or four			1
it was pretty basic stuff – mostly 4 × 2 blocks and a handful of 2 × 2 blocks			0
‘ i remember building a house out of it , and being shown by my mum to overlap the bricks to make a strong wall rather than building straight towers that would easily fall			0
’ he added : ‘ @entity0 for me was always about creativity , remaking and improving on existing designs			1
those things do n’t happen with sets that are designed to build a model of a single thing			0
‘ but that ’s not the only problem – @entity0 taught me the art of creative destruction – the need to break something in order to make something better			1
‘ single outcome sets encourage preservation rather than destruction , and sadly that makes them less useful , less educational and in my opinion less fun			1
’ his comments coincide with the launch of @entity75 show for @entity0 enthusiasts , which opens today in @entity77			1
it appears his fears have some powerful advocates			0
the @entity82 - winning chemist sir @entity81 argues that @entity32 - designed @entity83 , which involves putting nuts and bolts together , is of greater educational value because it mimics real - life engineering			2
blogger @entity31 complained that the branded @entity0 gave children fewer options than ordinary blocks he says : ‘ there is no comparison			1
children should start with @entity0 , which is basically a toy , and its basic units are bricks			1
we do not build cars and other machines out of bricks			0
’ the issue was highlighted by the @entity102 , where contributors to a @entity105 discussion disagreed over the impact of the changes made by @entity0 in recent years			1
@entity108 suggested it was evidence of dumbing down			0
he complained : ‘ even @entity0 now can not let you think , you must build what they say			1
‘ in my day i had a bucket full and built my own x wing , shuttle , castle or anything i wanted			0
‘ now you build what ’s on the box and do n’t you dare think for yourself and get creative you might grow up to be a thinker			0
’ @entity122 countered : ‘ my son loves to follow the instructions , great for spatial learning			2
once he ’s played with it enough he dismantles and creates his own stuff			0
’ @entity0 spokesman @entity128 denied the sets are less creative			2
he said : ‘ children still get bricks and they can combine them			2
the bricks will probably end up in big boxes in homes and that acts like a pool of creativity			0
’ a @entity0 spokesman denied the claims suggesting the branded boxes inevitably get combined with other @entity0 the brick count on the larger sets has risen in recent years			1
@entity143 of @entity145 ’s list is the model of the @entity146 , released in 2008 , with 5,922 parts			0
this took over from a limited - edition @entity11 / @entity150 mosaic , sold in 2005 , which had 5,462			2
the @entity152 of 2007 required the assembly of 5,174 pieces			0
modern themed @entity0 sets linked to big budget films can be very expensive			2
for example , the @entity157 comes in at £ 111.19 , while the @entity159 set called ‘ @entity160 ’ is £ 174.99			0
its @entity11 sets remain hugely popular with a version of the @entity152 costing £ 95			2
it is still possible to buy a box of bricks to allow youngsters to build their own toys and games			0
a 650 piece ‘ @entity170 ’ box comes in at £ 20.99 .			0

parents are worried that @entity0 with instructions ruins a child *'s* creativity
branded kits such as @entity11 or @entity12 also have specialist pieces
@entity0 fans claim that children should be allowed to use their imagination
one advocate claims branded @entity0 is less educational and less fun
