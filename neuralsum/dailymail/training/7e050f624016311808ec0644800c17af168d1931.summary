the @entity0 could cost as little as £ 270 when it launches later this year , according to a report in a @entity3 newspaper			1
the @entity4 reports that @entity6 's new gaming console will cost 40,000 yen - which translates to about £ 270			1
however , @entity8 gamers will have to factor in @entity9 , which adds a whopping 20 per cent to the price , taking the possible @entity8 figure to around £ 325			1
tantalizing : @entity6 posted a video teasing gamers to spark excitement about the forthcoming @entity0 console which will be in stores later in the year even at that price , the @entity0 will be a bargain			1
the @entity18 cost 60,000 yen when it launched in @entity3 2006			1
the new console is expected to be announced at a press conference in @entity21 on february 20			1
if the price is as low as the rumours suggest , it could steal a march on @entity27 's next - generation xbox console , which does n't yet have a launch date			1
@entity27 's console , which could be named the @entity30 720 , could be announced at the annual @entity32 gaming conference , held in @entity33 in june			2
by royal appointment : prince @entity35 was pictured using a @entity18 during a moment of relaxation at @entity38 in @entity39 in november and observers expect it to be on the shelves in time for @entity43 , which could mean a battle for supremacy between @entity27 and @entity6 as their next - generation consoles go head - to - head in the vital holiday season market			1
the next - generation xbox console could require gamers to be permanently connected to the internet - ruling out the use of second - hand games , according to a report in @entity56			1
the next @entity30 will ' be absolutely committed to online functionality ' , says the magazine , quoting sources with first - hand experience of @entity27 's latest console			2
gamers will be required to activate games in the same way as most other software from @entity27 and other publishers is already activated online			2
an activation system would check that you are the registered user of the game each time you start it up - you would n't even be able to lend it to a friend			0
however , the move to an always - on connection raises the possibility of games embracing other pricing models such as those seen on portable devices including smartphones and tablets			0
with an always - on connection , games could be very cheap , or even free , but make their profits through in - game purchases of better equipment			0
however , rumours suggested yesterday that gamers in the @entity8 could have to wait until next year until @entity6 's @entity0 finally lands on @entity8 soil			1
a developer told @entity56 that @entity6 is planning to concentrate its marketing efforts on its home market in @entity3 and the @entity90			0
the move would be to ensure that @entity6 can push sufficiently high numbers of the console out to stores for @entity43 and not lose sales because of insufficient units being shipped			2
all eyes are on the specs for @entity6 's new console			2
rumours yesterday surfaced that it would be heavily focused on the cloud , which would put the @entity3 ' firm 's purchase last year of a leading cloud - based gaming company into perspective			2
@entity6 paid $ 380 million for @entity107 in june last year			0
at the time @entity6 's chief executive , @entity108 , said : ' by combining @entity107 's resources including its technological strength and engineering talent with @entity109 's [ @entity109 ] extensive game platform knowledge and experience , @entity109 will provide users with unparalleled cloud entertainment experiences			0
' @entity109 will deliver a world - class cloud - streaming service that allows users to instantly enjoy a broad array of content ranging from immersive core games with rich graphics to casual content anytime , anywhere on a variety of internet - connected devices			0
' at the time it was reported that @entity107 had been hoping for a buyer to spend around $ 500 million			0
the new console is also expected to have a touchpad controller , as well as an eight - core x64 @entity141 processor ( codenamed ' @entity142 ) , @entity143 of @entity144 , @entity145 of video ram , four usb ports that use the new high - speed usb 3.0 standard , a blu - ray drive , a hard drive of @entity134 , an @entity135 , and both @entity137 and optical outputs			0
specs for the next - generation @entity30 are rumoured to be comparable , with insiders suggesting that it will also pack @entity150 of @entity144 , @entity137 connectors and usb 3.0			0
the launches are important for both @entity6 and @entity27 , as gamers have moved away from consoles since the @entity156 and the @entity18 debuted			1
more and more people have shifted to the tablet and the smartphone as a gaming platform			0
analysts expect that tablets and other mobile devices will match the power and graphics of today 's games consoles within a few years			0
many are already able to run the kinds of @entity170 games that were once the exclusive preserve of those dedicated machines and high - spec gaming @entity172 the slimline @entity18 cost 60,000 yen when it launched in @entity3 2006			1
the next generation @entity0 is expected to retail for around 40,000 yen ( about $ 430 )			0

reports say that price would be lower than @entity18 was at launch
@entity8 gamers might have to wait until next year for the console
