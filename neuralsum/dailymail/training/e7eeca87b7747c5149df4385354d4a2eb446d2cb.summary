burnt toast is one of life 's little annoyances			1
but while most of us have dealt with charcoal - crusts by simply throwing out the slices and starting again , one designer decided to find a solution			1
@entity9 , of @entity10 in @entity11 , has created a transparent toaster which lets you monitor your bread as it is browning			1
@entity11 designer @entity9 ingenious solution to avoid burnt toast features clear glass panels the updated kitchen appliance is currently in its conceptual stage this allows you to to keep an eye on the bread as it toasts , and remove it as soon as it reaches the desired levels of crispness			1
the updated kitchen appliance is currently in its conceptual stage and features all the same settings as a conventional machine			1
but this is n't the first time someone has thought of a see - through toaster			1
the world 's first transparent toaster , @entity35 's two - slice machine , took engineers 15 years to perfect @entity40 brand @entity38 's design also featured see - through panels on the side the world 's first transparent toaster , @entity35 's two - slice machine , took engineers 15 years to perfect			1
the Â£ 160 @entity45 also featured clear side panels with easy to use controls and was launched in the @entity48 four years ago			2
and earlier last year @entity40 brand @entity38 unveiled their take on the traditional kitchen appliance , which also had transparent panels on the side			1
it takes exactly 216 seconds to cook perfect toast scientists revealed the mathematical formula for a perfect slice of toast , showing that it is best cooked for exactly 216 seconds			0
a team of researchers carried out a study which found the optimum thickness is 14mm and the ideal amount of butter is 0.44 grams per square inch			0
the recommended cooking time gives the slice a ' golden - brown ' colour and the ' ultimate balance of external crunch and internal softness '			0
it has the look of ' builder 's tea ' and , crucially , the outside is 12 times crunchier than the middle			2
the result is achieved by setting the toaster dial to ' five out of six ' on a typical 900 - watt appliance to produce a temperature of 154 degrees @entity83			1
bread expert dr @entity84 , a consultant food researcher , spent one week toasting and tasting a staggering 2,000 slices for his research , in his bid to assist the nation 's toast eaters			2
we chomp our way through more than 94.2 million slices daily , though our enjoyment can be spoiled by burnt or soggy specimens			0
during his exhaustive study , commissioned by bread maker @entity97 's , dr @entity84 used a complex formula to help determine the toasting required to produce the perfect level of crispiness			2
he found that 216 seconds was the exact amount of time needed to toast the outside to the desired level before the golden 12:1 exterior / interior crispiness ratio was lost			0
he also discovered it was best to use a pale , seeded , loaf , taken fresh from the fridge at a temperature of 3 degrees @entity83			0
both sides of the bread should be cooked at the same time , using a toaster rather than a grill , to help ' curtail excessive moisture loss '			0
it should then be buttered as soon as it pops up , before the slice loses the heat required to melt the spread			0
the cooked and buttered slice should be cut once , diagonally , and served on a plate warmed to 45 degrees @entity83 , to minimise condensation beneath the toast			0
but it is important the plate is not too hot or it will continue the cooking process and ruin the perfectly formed slice .			0
