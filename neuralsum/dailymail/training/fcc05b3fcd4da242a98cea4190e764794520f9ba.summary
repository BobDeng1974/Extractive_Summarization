@entity1 talisman @entity0 has hailed @entity3 captain @entity2 as ' the best player i 've played against '			1
veteran lock @entity0 admitted boss @entity7 's side must be wary of @entity3 's lineout and driving maul in saturday 's autumn test at @entity12 's @entity11			1
the 37 - year - old @entity1 retired after the @entity13 , but was enticed back after a two - year break , since returning to action for both club and country			2
@entity3 lock @entity2 ( left ) is the ' best player ' who @entity1 star @entity0 has played against @entity0 ( left ) talks with @entity1 kicking coach @entity19 during training ahead of saturday 's game @entity22 second row @entity0 believes @entity23 enforcer @entity2 will once again prove central to @entity3 's tight work , under new forwards coach @entity25			1
' i think he ( @entity2 ) is a fantastic player , i think he 's probably the best player i 've played against in my career , ' said @entity0			1
' he is also a student of the lineout			0
' you can see he puts in a lot of hours in analysing , preparing and getting his whole unit ready for the weekend			0
' so it is always tough going up against him			0
' @entity3 are missing pack mainstays @entity33 and @entity35 to long - term injury , with the fast - improving @entity37 also absent and @entity38 battling to be fit for the weekend			2
@entity2 and @entity39 are @entity3 's shoo - in starting locks , with @entity41 and @entity42 sidelined			1
@entity2 led the @entity44 tour to @entity1 in 2009 but they were unsuccessful head coach @entity46 must also do without prop @entity47 , who was in line for his debut but damaged a biceps tendon in training			1
@entity0 drew on all his 117 - cap experience in predicting a gritty tussle up front with @entity3 , despite saturday 's hosts clear injury issues			1
the wily operator also launched the first charm offensive towards @entity59 referee @entity58 , who will officiate the weekend 's test clash			0
last season opponents often questioned the legality of @entity3 's highly - effective tactics at stopping rolling mauls			2
former forwards coach @entity65 whipped @entity3 's pack into accurate shape in diffusing opposition mauls , with officials mainly judging them the right side of the laws			1
@entity0 picked up that theme in making an early call for the @entity1 to take care to be water - tight with their own driving game			2
@entity78 lock @entity0 ( centre ) believes his side will face a tough test against @entity3 at the @entity11 ' i also think when @entity83 ( @entity86 forwards ' coach ) was here he gave a lot of insight into how i think about the lineout to @entity2 , so it makes it more difficult , ' said @entity0			1
' it is always a great battle against him and he has some great jumpers with him in that unit so we know it 's going to be very tough			0
' like i said , we know we have to be accurate in what we do because they will definitely put pressure on us			0
' the rolling maul is very important to us : looking at them as well , they were very successful in sacking the maul during the @entity104 , especially			0
' they stopped it very well , so we know we need to do our things right and hopefully the referee ( @entity58 ) will be very strict on how to stop the maul			0
' if we do our things right it is a lot easier for the ref to see if they are stopping the maul legally or not			0
' it 's important for us to get our set - up right , to get it started and from then it is easier			0
