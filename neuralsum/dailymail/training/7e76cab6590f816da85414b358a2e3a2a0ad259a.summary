by @entity0 published : 19:07 est , 1 may 2013 updated : 04:38 est , 2 may 2013 @entity1 was taken away in handcuffs after she refused to leave without her medical notes normally mild - mannered and calm , @entity1 found herself becoming unusually angry with the receptionist at her doctor ’s surgery			1
for the 67 - year - old grandmother and retired biomedical scientist had been asked by her gp to take a urine test to monitor a kidney condition she did not have			1
bewildered , she asked to have a copy of her medical notes , for which she paid £ 10			1
she was told to come back a week later to collect them			1
she did , yet when she arrived at the practice last december to find the notes were still not ready , @entity1 refused to leave without them and staged a sit - down protest in the waiting room			1
astonishingly , the surgery called the police and @entity1 was taken away in handcuffs			1
when @entity1 did get hold of her notes later that month , the apparent reason for the doctor ’s reluctance to release them quickly was clear — they were littered with errors			1
as well as being wrongly recorded as having chronic kidney disease , the healthy pensioner was said to be a heavy smoker who suffered from @entity34 ’s			1
the record also claimed incorrectly that she had undergone a hysterectomy and a double hip replacement			2
‘ i was utterly shocked , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ it read like a post-mortem , it really did			2
they must have been the entries for someone else			2
‘ it could have been really dangerous			2
who knows what implications these errors could have had if i ’d been taken to hospital in an emergency ? ’ @entity1 ’s doctor said the mistakes were caused by a ‘ filing error ’			1
but , alarmingly , there are concerns that errors on medical notes are not always accidental			1
indeed , there are fears that some @entity58 are fabricating medical records to reap financial rewards			2
if gps meet targets for monitoring conditions such as asthma and diabetes , they get extra funds — but for these to be made available , naturally some of their patients need to have the conditions in question			1
the organisation @entity71 found that one third of medical records contained @entity73 , a spokeswoman for the health service users ’ group @entity76 , highlights several cases			2
@entity78 found that one third of medical records contained errors one man went to see his doctor suffering from stress because he was being stalked by a woman , who was later convicted of the offence			2
some years later , he found that his notes said he was suffering from ‘ paranoid delusions ’ that he had a stalker			1
ms @entity73 says : ‘ this gentleman has been labelled a fruitcake for ever			1
he has been unable to get it removed from his records			2
he should be able to get an annotation on his notes at least , but he ca n’t			1
it is an extraordinary state of affairs			2
’ another woman , struggling with bloating and lethargy , was called a ‘ malingerer ’ in her notes			1
the wheat allergy found to have caused her ‘ fusspot ’ symptoms was diagnosed only when her records were lost			2
another man found that his records erroneously stated he suffered from heart disease			2
when he told his gp that this was incorrect , the doctor answered : ‘ can you prove it ? ’ in fact the patient happened to be chief executive of one of @entity115 ’s major hospitals , so he was more than able to correct his gp			2
but others are not so lucky			2
recent cases also abound on the internet			2
on a parenting blog , one mother writes : ‘ my doctor casually mentioned my son ’s epilepsy during a consultation last year			2
my son does not have epilepsy			2
’ another woman glanced at her doctor ’s screen and was ‘ gobsmacked ’ to see ‘ elephantiasis ’ — which is caused by tropical parasites — listed as a current condition			2
‘ my legs are a bit chunky but i doubt they would qualify for this ailment , ’ she says			2
‘ clearly there has been a mistake , but am unsure about challenging the doctors			2
’ fears about the consequences of challenging gps about their notes are not unfounded			1
in @entity1 ’s case , she has been struck off the patient list by her local health centre , having been labelled a ‘ problem patient ’			1
ms @entity73 insists that this is not an uncommon occurrence			0
‘ it ’s so difficult , ’ she says			0
‘ people say : “ i dare n’t ask for my notes because i ’ll be struck off			1
” we ca n’t tell them that this wo n’t happen because it does			0
’ patient concern wants to see an end to ‘ cradle - to - grave ’ notes that patients can not correct			1
‘ if something is wrong it is round your neck for ever , ’ says ms @entity73			0
‘ it is estimated that 40 per cent of doctors ’ notes are inaccurate			1
these errors could be life - threatening			0
yet doctors just do n’t like to admit they are wrong			0
’ she wants easier access to notes and a system whereby errors can be corrected — especially as the national computerisation of medical notes , which has been taking place over the past few years , has led to further mistakes creeping in as records are transferred from paper to computer			1
theoretically , patients have the right to see their medical records under the @entity185			0
the request can be refused only if it would cause serious harm to the patient ’s mental @entity189 , some doctors are still against patients having access to their notes , arguing that it restricts what they feel able to write			1
even if patients do manage to see their notes , they can face a struggle to have inaccuracies corrected			1
@entity199 campaigns against the @entity200 after she noticed on her records that she had been labelled an alcoholic take the horrifying case of @entity199			1
browsing through her @entity200 records in 2004 , the local councillor and former @entity200 manager from @entity206 , @entity207 , was confronted with an entry labelling her an alcoholic			1
‘ i went ballistic , ’ she says			0
‘ i have lived locally for a long time and know a lot of people who work in the @entity200			0
they could all have seen it			0
’ @entity199 had gone into hospital for a surgical procedure when she found that the error dating back to 1988 had been added to her computerised records			1
she was able to amend her records after a two - year battle , during which her mp raised her case in @entity224			0
@entity199 , 47 , now campaigns for @entity225 , a group that opposes the @entity200 — the vast computer network which was introduced in 2010 and holds information electronically			1
but this has left her vulnerable			0
‘ i ca n’t access @entity200 care , just because i do n’t want my data stored in this way , ’ she says			0
‘ i have been removed from @entity200 databases and do n’t even have an @entity200 number			0
‘ i ’m only able to access treatment when i ’m ill because medical colleagues treat me as a favour			0
nine years later , i still ca n’t access care			0
’ the case of @entity238 , a 40 - year - old pr consultant , is equally disturbing			0
she went to see the nurse for a routine matter and saw her notes over the nurse ’s shoulder			1
astonished , she realised that a doctor had made false and unpleasant references to her mental health after she complained that he had cut one of her appointments short			0
outraged , she asked to see a full copy of her records			0
@entity238 , who lives in @entity115 , had gone to see the doctor because she was suffering from extreme bruising , perhaps connected to a dietary deficiency			0
she says : ‘ the references made in my notes were to depression , bipolar disorder , hypomania , drug abuse and psychosis			1
the doctor made me look like a nutter			0
‘ this was all inferred from a meeting that was so rushed i could n’t even explain all my symptoms , and that ended with him pretty much pushing me out of the door			0
i reckon it lasted around five minutes			0
‘ i was so upset afterwards that i went straight to reception and complained that the doctor had been really rude			0
but it was only later that i found out what he had written in my records			0
’ after @entity238 alerted the surgery to these errors , she was told that the notes were the result of a ‘ bad day for the doctor ’			1
however , much to @entity238 ’s distress , any information on medical records can not be removed from the system , only added to			0
the @entity286 explains : ‘ medical records can not usually be changed because they are supposed to show what was written at the relevant time			0
however , a note can be added to your records explaining why you think they are incorrect and giving the correct version of events			0
’ @entity238 is understandably concerned that these erroneous claims are now irrevocably on her record			0
she is considering legal action			0
dr @entity297 , the founder of @entity71 , wants to see a new system where patients are in charge of their own notes and bring them to appointments			1
‘ a doctor should ask a patient for his or her notes , ’ he says			1
‘ medical notes are full of errors			1
' they continue to accumulate if patients never see their records			0
some are going to be dangerous			0
it is the patient and their family who have the biggest interest in their records			0
the patient and doctor should help each other , rather than trying to cover up errors			0
then we could avoid all this silliness			0
’ this would also stop @entity58 altering patients ’ notes to gain more funding from the @entity327 adds : ‘ if you look at @entity330 research , we know that data gets shaped differently when there are financial concerns			1
does that happen in the @entity335 ? draw your own conclusions			0
’ indeed , gps in the @entity335 earn around £ 1 billion a year from bonuses			1
about a quarter of their average income is linked to achieving government targets			1
whatever the reasons for these errors , they are deeply worrying and seem unlikely to improve in the foreseeable future , despite complaints from numerous patients			0
as ms @entity73 reflects : ‘ we have sat on @entity351 committees on this and nothing is done			0
after all , gps are very powerful people			1

if gps meet targets for monitoring conditions they get extra funds
