by @entity0 published : 19:58 est , 12 december 2013 updated : 20:09 est , 12 december 2013 his ability to dodge the enemy ’s bullet is the stuff of legend , but @entity7 was far more likely to die from liver disease or a drunken car crash , say doctors			1
they claim @entity7 ’s skilled exploits in the field of espionage – and the bedroom – were all the more remarkable in light of his drinking habits			1
while on @entity17 , @entity7 was putting away more than 90 drinks a week - four times the recommended limit			1
@entity20 as @entity7 takes a bath in diamonds are forever with the vodka and @entity24 close by			1
researchers claim @entity7 would have been a functioning alcoholic putting away 90 drinks a week astonishingly considering his prowess with the gun , it is claimed that his fondness for a vodka martini ‘ shaken not stirred ’ may have been the result of his hands shaking from alcohol - induced tremor			1
doctors who carried out a study of his unhealthy lifestyle conclude 007 , most recently played by @entity39 in @entity40 , was a ‘ functioning alcoholic ’			2
cheers : @entity43 's @entity7 gets stuck into yet another @entity24 the last thing you ’d want him to do is dismantle a bomb or give you a lift home , they argue			2
@entity50 , from @entity51 , and a colleague read all 14 @entity54 novels over a period of six months			2
they totted up @entity7 ’s alcohol consumption and found he was way over the recommended limit for safe drinking by men			2
the @entity61 recommends no more than three or four units a day - 28 units a week - while @entity7 was drinking on average between 65 and 92 units a week			1
the researchers said the stress of ‘ working with international terrorists and high stakes gamblers ’ may have driven him to drink excessively - before getting into his @entity68			1
the novels reveal he was more in danger of dying in a road accident or from liver disease than an enemy ’s bullet , say the researchers in the @entity79 issue			2
dr @entity50 , from @entity80 , said ‘ @entity7 is a functioning alcoholic , which really is n’t very consistent with his ability as a spy			1
‘ you would n’t want a high functioning alcoholic having to dismantle a bomb			2
‘ in @entity87 he drinks more than 39 units then jumps in a car ( his 1930 @entity90 litre ) and has a high speed chase , crashes and then spends 14 days in hospital			1
’ this would be eight pints of beer followed by eight glasses of wine , while his weekly consumption , 92 units , is approximately one and a half bottles of wine a day			1
dr @entity50 added : ‘ in one sitting it would be a two litre bottle of whisky , three glasses of wine and two pints of beer			0
‘ in real life a normal person would n’t be able to function like that , it would be impossible			0
‘ you would n’t be able to stand straight , let alone having the clarity of thought			0
while on @entity17 , @entity7 was putting away more than 90 drinks a week - four times the recommended limit ‘ despite his alcohol consumption , he is still described as being able to carry out highly complicated tasks and function at an extraordinarily high level			1
‘ this is likely to be pure fiction			0
’ in all 14 books , 123.5 days were described , though @entity7 was unable to consume alcohol for 36 days because of being imprisoned by hostile forces , or recovering from injuries sustained while on duty			0
out of the 87.5 days on which he was able to drink , he abstained on just 12.5 days.the most @entity7 ever drank on one day was almost 50 units in from @entity129 with @entity130			1
‘ we suspect that the famous catchphrase ‘ shaken , not stirred ’ could be because of alcohol induced tremor affecting his hands ’ , say the doctors			0
in real life , he would have been prey to alcoholic liver disease , cirrhosis , impotence , and other alcohol and smoking - related health problems			0
@entity7 's creator @entity54 , who died aged 56 , was a heavy drinker and smoker ‘ in reality he would be at high risk of sexual dysfunction too , which totally goes against the image of the character ’ says dr @entity50			0
the fate of his creator is probably the most sobering aspect of the story , he added			0
‘ @entity54 died at 56 and people say @entity7 is partly based on him			0
‘ he drunk a lot and he smoked a lot - it ’s possible @entity7 might have had a similar life span if he had been a real person			1
‘ his risk of death would have been 1.74 times the average , and his risk of cirrhosis seven to 16 times the average			0
‘ you ca n’t drink heavily and be high functioning			0
you will always pay for this kind of behaviour , unfortunately			0
‘ the message is that you should n’t drink this amount and expect to get away with it			0

fictional spy was *knocking* back between 65 and 92 units a week
in @entity87 he *quaffs* over 39 units then jumps in his @entity68
most he ever drunk in a day was 50 units in from @entity129 with love
