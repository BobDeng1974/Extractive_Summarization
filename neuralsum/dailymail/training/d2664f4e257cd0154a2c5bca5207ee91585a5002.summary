a woman who could face the death penalty for murdering her ex-boyfriend in a jealous rage has asked for the date of her sentencing to be delayed			1
@entity6 admitted killing her former lover @entity6 in 2008 , who was stabbed nearly 30 times , had his throat slit and was shot in the head , but said it was in self - defense			1
prosecutors said the murder was premeditated , and that @entity15 killed @entity16 because he wanted to end their affair			0
she was found guilty last year but jurors could not decide whether she deserved the death penalty , so a retrial to determine her punishment was set for next month			1
@entity6 was last year found guilty of brutally murdering her former lover @entity6 , but the jury could reach a decision on whether she should face the death penalty at a hearing on wednesday at @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity15 , 34 , asked for a delay to give her time to interview an expert witness she plans to call to testify and to review evidence			1
speaking softly while seated at a defense table alongside her two lawyers , it was the first time @entity15 had argued her own motions			2
@entity15 was previously granted permission to represent herself , so long as the two court - appointed attorneys stayed on as advisers			2
but yesterday @entity15 asked judge @entity48 to postpone the penalty phase of her murder trial , saying she would no longer represent herself if one of the defense lawyers quit the case			1
@entity54 , one of the two attorneys representing @entity15 , filed a motion last week which said that ' a completely fractured relationship between counsel ( and client ) now exists '			0
prosecutor @entity60 objected , saying that the case had dragged on long enough			0
he added that the original ruling allowing @entity15 to represent herself stated that there would be no delays			2
' she agreed to those terms , ' mr @entity60 told the judge			0
@entity15 , 34 , wants the sentencing to be delayed so she can interview an expert witness the convicted murderer also wants one of her defense lawyers to be removed , which could further delay the sentencing , which is set for september 8 in @entity30 , @entity31 @entity15 has tried to fire mr @entity54 several times , and he has sought to get off the case too			1
@entity15 told the judge that she would no longer serve as her own attorney and would let her other lawyer , @entity80 , argue the case if mr @entity54 was allowed to quit			1
' as far as i know , he has not done anything ' to assist in the defense lately , @entity15 told the judge			0
arguments were then closed to the media and public , and it was not immediately clear if the judge issued a ruling			0
the prosecutor and defense attorneys left court without comment			0
a hearing is set for august 22 on @entity15 's motion to postpone the retrial			0
under @entity31 law , @entity15 's murder conviction stands and prosecutors have the option of putting on a second penalty phase with a new jury in an effort to secure the death penalty			1
if a new jury fails to reach a unanimous decision , the judge will then sentence @entity15 to spend her life behind bars or to be eligible for release after 25 years .			2
