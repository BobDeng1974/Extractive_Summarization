the @entity0 has joined the @entity2 generation - sending her first ever tweet to declare a new exhibition at the @entity4 officially open			1
the royal tweet , with perfect punctuation , read : ' it is a pleasure to open the @entity8 exhibition today at the @ @entity9 and i hope people will enjoy visiting			1
@entity12 ' but now the account is being bombarded with questions from users desperate to grab the monarch 's attention			1
one asked about her x factor favourite while another urged the @entity0 , who he referred to as ' babe ' , to send out a selfie			1
the @entity0 's message was sent via the official @ @entity2 account , gaining its own hashtag # thequeentweets			1
as soon as the monarch pressed send , @entity2 users were quick to send their own messages back			1
many were sent by users welcoming the monarch to social media - with some encouraging her to embrace internet trends such as selfies and memes			0
however within just minutes of sending her first tweet , the @entity0 had already attracted her first troll			1
four minutes after she tweeted , one user replied telling her : ' welcome to twitter ! @entity65			1
' one @entity2 user offered some advice to the queen suggesting ' more kooky hashtags ' and ' cat meme ' for her next tweet the parody account @ @entity73 tweeted their tongue - in - cheek disapproval to the monarch 's first ever tweet after @entity0 sent the tweet , it appeared on the screen behind her for assembled guests to see he then continued saying : ' i like the fact that being a republican is now lower - effort than ever			1
' while others were pleased to see her on the social media forum and seized the opportunity to ask what they 've always wanted to know			0
one asked : ' @entity93 , who are you loving on @entity42 ? ! ' while another said : ' when will your selfie be , please your highness ? ' this afternoon the tweet was being displayed at the top of the @entity101 in central @entity28 as @entity102 are the lead sponsors of the new exhibition the @entity0 's visit to the @entity4 in @entity106 comes after the opening of a new £ 15.6million gallery during her reign the @entity0 has encountered many of the technological advances shown in the new exhibit the queen was accompanied by the @entity114 on her visit to the museum , where she was presented with a technology themed bouquet of flowers she was also given suggestions on what to tweet next with users asking her for ' kooky hashtags ' and cat memes			1
but one account that welcomed the tweet with caution was popular parody account @entity129			2
the humorous feed , which has almost two million followers posted : ' ca n't believe someone 's started a sodding parody account ' , with a picture of the tweet			2
the @entity0 watches herself at the @entity136 on a television set from the 1950s at the exhibition called ' @entity8 ' during her reign , the @entity0 has encountered a rapidly changing technological world			2
here she inspects an aerial tuning inductor from @entity142 in 1943 the tweet was sent at the £ 15.6 million gallery at the museum in @entity106 , @entity28 features more than 800 objects and explores how breakthroughs have transformed the way people communicate over the past 200 years			0
normally a plaque is unveiled to herald the launch of a new project by a royal but this time the @entity0 , aged 88 , sent the tweet , marking a technological milestone			2
for her visit to the museum she wore a vibrant blue coat and hat , with some on @entity2 pointing out her colour choice was similar to that of the site 's bird logo			2
during her reign the @entity0 has encountered a rapidly - changing world of technology from the advent of the colour television to the mobile phone and the internet			0
television cameras were allowed inside @entity171 in 1953 to film her @entity136 and more than half a million extra television sets were sold in the weeks running up to the historic event			0
five years later she made the first trunk call in the @entity175 and when email technology was in its infancy , the @entity0 became the first monarch to send one of the electronic messages , in 1976 during a visit to an @entity183 base			2
the concept of video - sharing website @entity186 was explained to her by granddaughters @entity187 and @entity189 before she launched her own channel on the site in 2007 to promote the @entity175 monarchy			0
her own website , www.royal.gov.uk , was launched in 1997 during a visit to @entity196 in @entity197 , north west @entity28			0
other technological milestones for the @entity0 include personally uploading a video on to @entity186 , during a visit to the @entity202 offices in @entity28 in 2008			0
however , she is n't the first royal to use @entity2 as her son , the @entity203 is the most prolific tweeter in the royal family and has an account under his own name			2
he signs off messages he has written with @entity212 , for @entity213			0
the micro-blogging site has also been used by her grandson @entity215 , who sent his first official tweet in may , but he admitted during the summer he no longer has a personal account , when chatting to a group of students who were promoting his @entity220 on social media			1
the @entity0 and members of her family are represented on @entity2 by the account @ @entity226 , while @ @entity227 covers the @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity114 and @entity230 and prince @entity215			1
the @entity0 is n't the only member of the royal family to have tweeted			2
her son the @entity203 has his own @entity2 account and her grandson @entity215 has also used the micro-blogging site the @entity0 launched her own website in 1997 during a visit to a @entity28 school while in 2008 she uploaded her first video to @entity186 the @entity0 's grandson @entity215 has also used @entity2 and sent his first official tweet in may the prince sent the tweet to promote his @entity220 , which was held in @entity28 for injured servicemen and women normally a plaque is unveiled by a member of the royal family to launch a new project , but this time the @entity0 decided to mark a technological milestone the @entity0 made technological history again yesterday but she learned she will also have to roll with the inevitable punches of the internet age			1
because just four minutes after sending her first ever tweet , the @entity0 became a victim of trolling			2
at 11:35am @entity0 ’s message went out from the @ @entity31 account to 724,000 followers on @entity2 as she opened a gallery at the @entity4 in @entity28			1
the tweet read : ‘ it is a pleasure to open the @entity8 exhibition today at the @entity9 and i hope people will enjoy visiting			2
@entity12 ’ initially the post was retweeted , or shared , nearly 7,000 times , with the @entity4 becoming the first to reply			0
‘ we ’re honoured @entity0 chose to open our @entity8 gallery by sending her first tweet , ’ their message read			1
but at 11:39am one user lowered the tone considerably , posting : ‘ welcome to @entity2 ! @entity65			1
’ sadly it was retweeted more than 100 times			0
the user later posted : ‘ i like the fact that being a republican is now lower - effort than ever ’ , suggesting that they think they will be able to reach the @entity0 directly with their anti-monarchy views			0
soon other @entity2 users had joined in sending abusive messages , some of which are too unpleasant to publish here			0
@entity287 , @entity288 mp for @entity289 , attacked the original ‘ abdicate ’ tweet			0

’ @entity295 , @entity288 mp for @entity296 , added : ‘ it ’s an insult			0
we have a monarchy that ’s living in the modern world and for anyone to respond in that way is scandalous			0

she is showing she is keeping up to date and embracing technology and change			0
’ last night it was unclear which device was used to send the @entity0 ’s tweet			1
