by @entity0 and @entity1 for @entity2 @entity3 think that milk , tea bags and e-books are good value for money while cinema food , petrol and train travel are a rip - off , according to a study			1
consumers feel they only get their money 's worth in four out of ten of their day - to - day purchases			0
the study into the average person 's spending and the value of the £ 1 coin was commissioned by @entity25 to mark the launch of the first £ 1 mobile phone tariff			1
poor value ? a quarter of @entity3 would not stop to pick up a pound coin in the street , a survey revealed twenty - four per cent of the 2,000 questioned said they would not stop to pick up a £ 1 coin in the street			1
financial expert @entity36 , who worked with @entity25 on the campaign , revealed a sharp decline in the purchasing power of the pound over the last 30 years			0
he said : ' it wo n't come as a surprise to anybody that you now get so much less for a pound than you could 30 years ago , but it 's really quite an eye opener to see the level of apathy that the @entity3 public have towards the humble pound coin			2
' we 've got to a stage where we simply do n't expect a pound to buy us anything of real value , so it 's refreshing to see an affordable pay as you go package now available to go some way to bucking this trend			0
' the study also found although nine in ten said they had shopped in a @entity66 pound shop in the past , nearly half said that they never expect to find anything of genuine value when doing so			0
a quarter of those polled believed that rising inflation has rendered the pound coin all but obsolete			2
an additional study conducted by @entity36 revealed that in the year of its launch a pound coin was enough to buy three dozen eggs , a pint and a quarter of beer and two and a half litres of petrol			1
the good and the bad : milk is still seen as good value but cinema food like popcorn is n't worth it , apparently today , however it would get you just three and a half eggs , a quarter of a pint of beer and three quarters of a litre of petrol			1
and that 's led many a @entity94 to no longer see any real value in the pound coin believing that inflation has rendered it virtually obsolete , with one in seven of us happy to see it go out of circulation completely			0
instead , common purchases like videogames , microwave meals and even the cost of a haircut are now seen as not representing value for money overall			0
a spokesman for @entity25 , said yesterday : ' it 's clear that current public perception is that there 's little out there for people to enjoy for a pound , which has led us to introduce our new offering			0
' the top ten items rated as good value : 1 milk ; 2 paracetamol ; 3 tea bags ; 4 fruit ; 5 bread ; 6 toilet rolls ; 7 coffee ; 8 clothing ; 9 e-books ; 10 laptops			2
the ten items rated as the worst value : 1 cinema food ; 2 petrol ; 3 train travel ; 4 cinema tickets ; 5 football tickets ; 6 paying to use the lavatory at stations ; 7 white wine in a pub ; 8 gym membership ; 9 car insurance ; 10 satellite tv .			1

a quarter of @entity3 would not stop to pick up a £ 1 coin in the street
consumers see milk as good value but petrol and cinema food as a rip - off
a pound could buy 36 eggs , a pint of beer and 2.5l petrol when it launched
