by @entity0 published : 11:10 est , 2 december 2013 @entity2 : 14:16 est , 2 december 2013 it seems @entity4 has become a little prudish with its latest @entity7 @entity6 operating system - especially when it comes to feminine hygiene and sex			1
a list of banned phrases has revealed the tech giant will offer predictive suggestions when a user types the words ‘ marijuana ’ and ‘ bong ’ , but refuses to offer help for words such as ‘ condom ’ , ' @entity23 ' ' braless ' ‘ intercourse ’ and even ‘ geek ’			1
the words were discovered in the source code of the new software by @entity28 and @entity4 has declined to comment on why and how it made the choices			1
@entity28 has discovered a list of banned @entity7 words , including ' intercourse ' , ' condom ' and even ' geek '			2
when an @entity7 user is typing they can enable predictive text suggestions to appear above the keyboard , pictured			1
@entity4 then guesses which word they 're trying to write but wo n't show any words on the banned list selection of banned words @entity4 does n't show in its predictive text tool : sex , intercourse , lovemaking , coitus , penis , vagina , irrumination , pizzle , butt , panty , braless , @entity53 , preggers , suck , screw , geek , @entity56 , thud			1
allowed controversial words : marijuana , bong , methamphetamine , nazi so - called banned words are n’t words that @entity4 will physically stop users from typing			2
instead they are words that do n't feature in its built - in predictive text dictionary			2
for example , when an @entity7 user is typing texts or emails , they can enable predictive text suggestions to appear above the keys			2
as the user types , @entity4 will try and guess which word they are trying to write and offer a list to choose from			1
to make typing faster , users can select the word from this list rather than manually typing the word			0
it also speeds things up when people use the swiping feature , which lets them swipe over the letters rather than selecting them individually			0
according to the list of words discovered by @entity92 ’s @entity91 , if a user starts to type the words ‘ sex ’ , ‘ intercourse ’ or ‘ lovemaking ’ , @entity4 will not show them as suggestions			1
typing the word ‘ condom ’ gives suggestions for ‘ condition ’ or ‘ confusion ’			0
many of the banned words relate to reproduction , genitalia and swearing , however there are a number of words that @entity4 wo n't offer suggestions for because it does n't recognise that the words exist			0
this includes @entity56 , the name of @entity4 's very own range of laptops , pictured @entity4 is n’t the only company guilty of partly censoring words in messages ; a report in july discovered @entity122 does similar			0
analysis from news website @entity124 found that @entity127 handsets running @entity128 will not suggest corrections for words considered to be sensitive or provocative			0
researchers used the built - in spell checker in the @entity134 developer platform to test more than 250,000 words and discovered that suggestions do not apply for words including ' abortion ' , ' bullet ' , ' suicide ' and ' pornography ' when they have been mistyped			0
the report found that from the 165,000 - word dictionary built into @entity7 @entity6 , 1,400 @entity144 words have been deemed inappropriate			2
words for genitalia are banned , as are certain medical terms relating to genitalia , including ‘ irrumination ’			0
the word ‘ butt ’ is banned , as is ‘ panty ’ , feminine hygiene brand ‘ @entity23 ’ and ‘ preggers ’ among others that relate to reproduction or sexually transmitted diseases			0
words that are n’t generally considered offensive and do n’t relate to human anatomy yet are still on the list include ‘ geek ’ and ‘ thud			1
’ @entity165 also points out the word ‘ supremacist ’ is banned , but ‘ @entity167 ’ is n’t			2
swear words are blocked from appearing automatically , but that list includes the word ‘ pizzle ’ – on old @entity144 word for penis			1
words including ‘ suck ’ and ‘ screw ’ also do n’t show up as suggestions , which was the case in @entity177 too			0
many of these banned words are recognised , once they ’ve been manually typed , and @entity4 knows if they ’ve been spelt correctly or not			0
however , other words @entity4 does n’t even recognise as words include @entity56 – the name for its own brand of laptops .			1

list of words were found in the source code for @entity7 ’s @entity6 software
it includes *synonyms* for sex , genitalia and *pregnancy* plus the word ‘ geek ’
if a user types these words , @entity4 does n't show them in its predictive text
controversial allowed words include ‘ marijuana ’ and ‘ bong ’ as well as ' @entity167 '
