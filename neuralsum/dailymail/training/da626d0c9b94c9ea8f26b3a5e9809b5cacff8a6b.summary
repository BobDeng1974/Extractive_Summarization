and what with all those sea urchins , lion fish and moray eels lurking in the rocks , its probably not a good idea to go poking around too diligently			0
but @entity13 , along with new bride @entity14 , begged their instructors to help them search the reef after his ring slipped off his finger during a honeymoon diving expedition			2
@entity21 honeymooner @entity13 lost his wedding ring while snorkelling in the @entity1 with wife @entity14			1
the ring was found in the coral after the couple returned home and has now been returned to their home in @entity29 after several hours , they gave up and the couple returned to the @entity21 thinking the silver band was lost forever			1
but just a few days later , the couple , both 29 , received an email from the diving company telling them the ring had been found			2
miraculously , a sightseer on the same expedition as theirs spotted the ring glinting on a piece of coral and handed it to staff at the @entity44 diving school – not knowing what joy his find would bring			0
mr @entity13 , a credit card claims handler from @entity29 , said : ‘ i ’m not used to wearing rings so i had been playing with it non-stop since our wedding day			1
@entity13 pictured on his wedding day showing off his new ring ( left ) and on the dive where he lost it ( right ) the spot on the @entity1 where @entity13 lost his wedding ring ‘ i got out of the sea and went to fiddle with it and realised it had gone			1
‘ the honeymoon to @entity63 was the trip of a lifetime			0
‘ coming back without the ring was heartbreaking but getting it back like this is the icing on the cake			0
’ the wedding band arrived safely in the post last week			0
@entity73 , co-owner of the @entity74 , said : ‘ it ’s truly amazing the ring survived , especially because fish often eat shiny or sparkly objects mistakenly for food			0
‘ we all got tingles when we found out it was a wedding ring and could belong to someone who had gone on one of our tours			2
‘ it ’s a beautiful omen to their marriage , which i think shows they are meant to be together forever			0
