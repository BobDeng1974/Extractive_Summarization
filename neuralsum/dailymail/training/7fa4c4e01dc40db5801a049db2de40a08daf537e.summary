by @entity1 reporter published : 11:06 est , 24 june 2013 updated : 11:08 est , 24 june 2013 @entity2 under 40 years old are worse off than their parents for the first time since the @entity5			0
twenty and 30 - somethings , also known as @entity7 and @entity8 , are the only age group in the country currently worse off than their parents three decades ago , according to a recent study by the @entity12 titled ' @entity13 ? @entity14 among @entity2 '			1
@entity2 in their 30s have been hit particularly hard — their average net worth has decreased 21 per cent from what previous 30 - somethings had in 1983 , @entity15 reported			1
stagnation : a recent study by the @entity12 found that younger generations are no longer better off than their parents			1
the average net worth of 30 - somthings today has decreased 21 per cent since those in 1983 the grim study , published by a @entity26 , think tank , noted that @entity2 ' wealth has ' grown significantly ' despite the poor state of the economy			1
in fact , the average household wealth doubled from 1983 to 2010 and incomes have increased — but this is not the case for younger generations			1
' for many , the @entity37 dream of working hard , saving more , and becoming wealthier than one'sparents holds true , ' the study 's authors write			2
' unless you 're under 40			0
' typically , as society gets wealthier , children get richer than their parents , the study notes			2
for instance , the average net worth of @entity44 aged 56 to 64 increased 120 per cent from their counterparts in 1983			1
@entity2 over 74 have an average net worth 149 per cent more than the oldest citizens three decades ago			1
line : younger generations , shown at the bottom with turquoise and red lines , are not accumulating wealth over time like previous generations this trend is no longer the case , partially because the @entity59 hit young homeowners in their 20s and 30s the hardest			1
but the study 's authors say younger generations were in trouble even before the recession hit			1
stagnant wages , diminishing job opportunities and shrinking home values play an important role in younger @entity37 's harsh new reality			1
lack of educational attainment higher than previous generations also factored in			2
college debt stifles potential savings as well			0
most jobs — even some with low hourly wages — require at least a four - year degree			2
some 20 million @entity2 attend college each year and nearly 60 per cent borrow to pay for school , according to the nonprofit @entity79			0
all those loans amount to roughly $ 870 billion in outstanding student debt , according to the @entity82			0
a quarter of 30 - somethings have outstanding loan debt , but only 7.4 per cent of borrowers older than 40 have outstanding debt			1
stressed : unlike their parents , 20 and 30 - somethings are n't able to save money , using much of their earnings to pay bills , student loans and rent because of these burdens , younger @entity2 ca n't imagine saving and building up a nest egg like their parents			1
@entity97 , a 33 - year - old from @entity98 , @entity99 , laughed when @entity15 asked her if she had any savings			2
' my glass is always half full			0
i 'm still day by day trying to something more			0
what else is there ? ' @entity97 said			0
@entity97 runs her own fitness studio and works nonstop , but continues to struggle			0
her earnings go directly to bills , college loans , rent and a car payment			0
changes : in the past , kids earned more than their parents as society became wealthier , but this is no longer the case with a baby on the way , @entity97 is worried about her future			0
she owes over $ 15,000 in college loans			0
' i mean , this is everything that i 've ever wanted			0
i 've always wanted to own my own business , ' she said			0
' i 've wanted to be a mom and have a family most importantly , of my own , so i 've gotten those things , but financially how do i do it ? ' the study 's authors suggest the government should pay more attention to the hardships of younger generations — or else			2
' if current trends for younger generations are not reversed , within a few decades they may become more dependent than older @entity2 today , especially in retirement , upon safety net programs less capable of providing basic support , ' the study concludes .			1

@entity12 study says younger generations do n't build as much wealth
average net worth of 30 - somethings has decreased 21 **%** since 1983 , but for 74 and older , average net worth has increased 149 **%**
trend caused by stagnant wages , fewer jobs , shrinking home values and high loan burdens
