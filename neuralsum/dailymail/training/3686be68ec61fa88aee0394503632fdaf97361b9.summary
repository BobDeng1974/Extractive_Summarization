by @entity0 follow @ @ charliefscott arguably the player of the tournament before kick - off , @entity2 's @entity1 ended with a poor display in @entity7 , as he was thwarted at every turn by @entity9			1
the @entity11 winger was @entity12 's standout performer in the group stage , scoring three times in three games to send @entity17 's side through as group winners - but he failed to have an impact on proceedings at the @entity21 , with @entity22 going through to the final on penalties			1
seconds later he controls a great lofted ball by @entity51 but the flag is up and play is brought back			0
12mins – @entity9 dispossesses @entity2 with a smart sliding tackle on the right , but the ball falls straight to the feet of @entity58 , who smashes a shot wide from 25 yards			2
block : the @entity30 creates a yard for himself but @entity41 recovers well to stop his cross swamped : @entity22 's defenders crowded @entity2 out whenever the ball went near him not happy : @entity17 had a couple of angry exchanges with his star player during the match a rare touch : @entity2 touched the ball just six times in the opening 45 minutes , two of which were throw - ins half - time : @entity12 0 - 0 argentina @entity2 touched the ball just six times in the first half - the @entity12 goalkeeper @entity78 had 20 touches - and also made just one successful pass			1
if that was n’t bad enough , two of his touches were to take throw - ins on the right - hand side and another was after receiving the ball back from a team - mate from one of those throws			1
needless to say , his impact in the opening 45 minutes was minimal , as the likes of @entity9 and @entity41 stuck close to him and nipped in front to steal the ball before it ever reached him			2
49mins – the speedy attacker wins a free - kick for @entity12 after controlling the ball with his back to goal and being pulled back by @entity101			1
the @entity102 picked up a yellow card for the foul on his former @entity11 team - mate			2
54mins – had as many touches in one dribble as he did in the whole of the first half , sprinting at the heart of the @entity102 defence before losing control of the ball			2
foul : @entity2 's former @entity11 team - mate @entity101 is booked for pulling the @entity30 back rival : @entity118 saw far more of the ball in the first half than his opponent @entity2 on the ball : @entity2 started to demand the ball from his team - mates in the second half 66mins - takes a pass from @entity126 in his stride on the right but his progress is slowed by @entity130			1
@entity2 cuts inside and holds the ball up so his team - mates can catch up with him , before sweeping a pass out to @entity58 on the left			0
74mins - the @entity11 winger is resorting to drifting from one side of the pitch to the other in search of the ball			0
unfortunately for him , a number of passes towards him have been wildly overhit			0
75mins - flicks a pass into the path of the overlapping @entity146 , who whips a cross into the box that @entity47 is unable to acrobatically direct towards goal			0
help me : @entity2 made some decent runs in the second half but his team - mates failed to find him 83mins - @entity153 his first cross of the evening straight down @entity156 's throat			2
@entity157 prods the ball off @entity2 's toes as the @entity30 attacker tries to cause some damage on the left with minutes left on the clock			0
90mins - the best chance of the game falls to @entity2 as the clock ticks into added time			0
@entity58 flicks the ball to his side on the edge of the @entity22 box and @entity2 steams past and takes it with him			0
his next touch takes him wide of @entity156 's goal but he is still able to get a shot away - only for @entity9 to throw himself in front of the strike and put the ball behind			1
through on goal : @entity2 bursts into the box and sends a shot goalwards with his left foot brilliant block : @entity9 thwarts @entity2 by diving in front of the @entity30 's shot big chance : @entity2 puts his hands to his head after his shot is blocked by @entity9 in the 90th minute end of normal time : @entity12 0 - 0 @entity22 - after an unusually quiet 89 minutes from @entity2 he had a glorious opportunity to win the game			1
what stood in his way was @entity9 , just as he had done all night			0
the @entity102 midfielder threw his body in front of @entity2 's shot , which ensured normal time ended goalless			1
96mins - takes the captain 's armband from the departying @entity47 and immediately produces a flash of brilliance , dinking the ball between @entity101 and @entity41 , somehow following it through the gap and then winning a corner off the legs of @entity9			1
@entity28 sandwich : @entity2 retrieves the ball after slipping it between @entity41 and @entity101 99mins - thumps a fizzing shot at goal that @entity156 gratefully gathers in his arms			0
if @entity2 's strike had nicked off one of the @entity22 defenders on its way to goal it could have caused seriously problems for the goalkeeper			0
close eye : @entity2 found it very difficult to evade the attention of @entity9 passes - 36 duels won - 5/17 aerial duels won - 0/3 successful crosses - 0 chances created - 0 shots on target - 1 distance covered - 13.5km 119mins - @entity2 controls a curling pass superbly on the left and tries to jink into the box , but again @entity9 is there to stop him in his tracks and hammer the ball away from danger			1
@entity239 : took @entity12 's second penalty and showed no nerves whatsoever as he waited for @entity156 to dive before firing his spot - kick into the bottom right corner			2
@entity2 's involvement in the tournament ended as @entity102 won the shootout 4 - 2 thanks to @entity156			1
the @entity250 shotstopper made two great saves from @entity252 and @entity58 to knock @entity17 's side out and seal a place in the final			0
no end product : @entity2 was involved in attacking areas but failed to create chances for his team - mates @entity102 scrape through to final			0

@entity261 touched the ball just six times in first half , twice to take throw - ins
he came into the game having scored three times in five games in @entity271
but he was never afforded space by @entity102 's determined back - line , with @entity9 in particular keeping a very close eye on him
he *improved* after the break but still was afforded little time on the ball
@entity9 blocked his shot in 90th minute that would have won the game
he scored his penalty in the shootout but it was not enough for @entity12
