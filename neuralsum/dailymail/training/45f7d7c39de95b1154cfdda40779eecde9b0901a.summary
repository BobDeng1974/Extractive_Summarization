we need to define what the @entity40 test is and make it binary			1
’ the claim that @entity57 journalists had deleted messages on @entity42 ’s mobile phone , giving her parents false hope that she was alive , provoked a national outcry and led to the closure of the paper			0

testing : the document reveals how @entity5 capitalised on what it calls ' the @entity40 test ' , a reference to murdered schoolgirl @entity42 ‘ it is precisely the manipulative tendency we were led to believe that they deplore			1
’ the document has been leaked to this newspaper by a hacked off whistleblower appalled by the group ’s manoeuvrings			1

the outcome could hinge on how many conservative mps defy mr @entity15 and back the @entity176 alliance			0
the leaked memo says it has only ‘ one aim – an independent statutory regulator with punitive powers ’			2
it says : ‘ within the government there is a cabal of discontents , right - wing outliers and mavericks unwilling to toe the party line , happy to ignore the whip and keen to evict the tenants of @entity191			2
