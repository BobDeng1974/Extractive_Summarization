foreign workers employed by arts and craft chain @entity2 have been told to speak @entity4 or face the sack			1
staff at the supplier 's distribution warehouse in @entity9 - upon - @entity10 , @entity11 , were hauled in for a meeting this week after difficulties arose with different nationalities conversing only in their native tongue			1
@entity6 were told the firm ’s policy was they should only use @entity4 during work hours and , if caught doing otherwise , they could be disciplined			2
staff at the @entity2 warehouse in @entity9 ( pictured ) were told they could face disciplinary action if they did n't speak @entity4 at work a @entity2 director said the move was to ' create a good working environment @entity29 , people director for @entity2 , said : ' having the ability to speak @entity4 is part of the recruitment criteria in our distribution centre , however within the social areas colleagues can speak all languages ' therefore , we do ask that during working hours in the warehouse colleagues speak @entity4			1
' this is to create a good working environment where all colleagues can communicate effectively			1
but one @entity44 worker , who asked not to be named for fear of repercussions , said that she thought the move was ' silly '			1
she said : ' our managers forbid us from speaking to others in any language but @entity4			2
@entity2 currently has 79 art and craft stores across the @entity53 , he first store opened in @entity55 in 1995 ' the first few months were not that bad and , if they spotted someone using any other language , the person would basically get told off			0
' but then all staff were called to the canteen to be told that we were only allowed to speak @entity4 while working and , if we do not , we will face punishment			1
i know it sounds silly but i think it is something that is important and needs raising			0
' however , the move could land bosses in hot water as @entity71 law firm warns the policy could be indirectly discriminatory and could lead to compensation claims			0
@entity74 , employment lawyer at the firm , said : ‘ there would certainly be a potential claim for indirect racial discrimination			0
‘ although this policy is going to apply to all staff obviously it will put staff who are not native @entity4 speakers at a disadvantage compared to those who are			2
‘ it would be natural for workers of the same nationality to speak to each other in the same language			0
‘ where there are health and safety reasons requiring people to give clear instructions i can absolutely see there would be potential justification but to impose a blanket ban i think would be difficult to justify			0
