a fourth new identity is to be created for one of @entity3 's killers when he is freed from prison once again - bringing the public bill for protecting the murderer to a reported £ 1million			1
@entity3 , 30 - who was released from his life sentence in 2001 - was locked up again three years ago after being caught with child porn images on his computer , but has now been granted parole in a decision that has left the murdered toddler 's parents ' filled with terror '			1
the killer was given a new identity when he was sent to a young offenders ' institution at the age of 10 for murdering the two - year - old with @entity24 , then a second was created for him when he was controversially released from his life sentence in 2001			2
@entity27 was given a third taxpayer - funded identity after he was sent back to jail in 2010 for possessing child abuse images , and officials are now understood to be working on a fourth new alias to protect his anonymity as it emerged the killer is to be freed once more			1
decision : @entity3 ( left ) , now 30 , one of the killers of @entity3 ( right ) , is to be released from prison taxpayers will again pick up the bill for the latest identity switch , each of which are reported to cost around £ 250,000			1
officials were last night working on giving @entity3 his fourth secret new identity			1
taxpayers will pick up the bill , likely to run into hundreds of thousands of pounds , for the move and for monitoring @entity50 around the clock			0
only a tight - knit cabal operating under conditions of extreme secrecy will know who he really is			0
one or two senior probation officers will regularly visit @entity58 to ensure he is adhering to the conditions of his @entity61 will include a ban on travelling to @entity63 , and he also faces restrictions on accessing the internet after his 2010 conviction for possessing child abuse images			2
@entity27 was given his first new identity when he was jailed in 1993 , and a second when he was released from a sentence of indefinite imprisonment in 2001 aged 18			1
in may 2011 , his name and background was changed once again after a ‘ serious breach ’ in the security of the identity he had been using.earlier this year officials said they would not give him another identity because he could not be trusted to keep it secret			2
but they have been forced to change their minds amid mounting fears for his safety if he is outed.earlier this year pictures purporting to be of @entity50 were circulated on the internet , despite an injunction granting him lifetime anonymity			0
only three other people are so notorious that they have been given new identities and made subject to lifelong anonymity orders			0
they are @entity50 ’ co-defendant @entity24 , @entity94 – the ex-girlfriend of @entity97 murderer @entity96 – and child killer @entity98			0
