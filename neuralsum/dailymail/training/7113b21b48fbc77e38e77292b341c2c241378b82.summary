by @entity0 published : 06:00 est , 19 january 2013 updated : 08:47 est , 19 january 2013 an former @entity1 who was struck down by a car and catastrophically injured after dropping his trousers in the @entity6 has won the right to millions in compensation			2
even though @entity11 ' behaviour had been ' reprehensible ' and ' very foolish ' a judge ruled that the driver who hit him was 80 % to blame for the tragedy that wrecked his life			1
mr @entity11 , then aged 24 years , had been out with friends and was in high spirits when he strolled out into the @entity6 and exposed himself to oncoming traffic			1
injured : former @entity1 @entity11 suffered brain damage when he was hit by a car after he walked into the road with his trousers and underpants pulled down his girlfriend , @entity23 tried to convince the ex-serviceman to cover up , however mr @entity11 continued to stand in @entity25 , central @entity26 with his trousers and underpants around his ankles as driver @entity30 approached			1
the 28 - year - old freight company worker 's @entity31 struck mr @entity11 , who hit his head on the kerb as he fell to the ground			1
mr @entity11 , who had served two tours in @entity37 with the @entity1 , suffered devastating brain damage in the collision , which occurred shortly after midnight on september 27 , 2008 , and was faced with a lifetime of serious disability			1
the care he will require for the rest of his life was estimated to cost millions of pounds and many of his friends have organised a series of charity events , including marathon runs and a benefit rugby match , to raise funds for him			0
high court judge mrs justice @entity52 yesterday guaranteed that mr @entity11 would be awarded a huge compensation payout when she ruled that mr @entity30 bore the lion 's share of blame for the accident			2
rejecting as ' inherently implausible ' the driver 's plea that his car had not even touched mr @entity11 before he fell , the judge said that mr @entity30 's initial account to police of a crowd of people surrounding him and urinating on his car before the accident was ' wholly false '			1
ruling : high court judge mrs justice @entity52 guaranteed that mr @entity11 would be awarded compensation for his injuries , despite calling his actions ' foolish ' mr @entity11 ' not acting in a hostile or threatening manner ' towards the driver or actively interfering with his car , said the judge			1
however , she firmly rejected claims that mr @entity30 had deliberately or recklessly driven into the half naked pedestrian , who at the time was working as a trainee nurse at @entity78 , in @entity26			0
finding mr @entity30 80 per cent to blame , the judge said that he had probably wrongly believed that , by steering slightly to his left , he could avoid mr @entity81 and get safely on his way			0
mrs @entity52 ruled that mr @entity11 ' behaviour , ' whilst reprehensible ' and ' very foolish ' , had not caused the accident			0
however , the judge said that he could not be absolved from all responsibility and found him 20 per cent to blame			0
he had placed himself in danger by standing , half - clothed , in the @entity6 in front of mr @entity30 's car			0
' his drunken state and dropped trousers hampered his ability to move freely and at a normal speed out of the path of the car , ' the judge added			0
the court 's ruling means that mr @entity11 ' compensation will now be assessed on the basis of 80 per cent liability			2
the amount of his payout will be calculated at a further court hearing , unless final settlement terms are agreed before then .			0
