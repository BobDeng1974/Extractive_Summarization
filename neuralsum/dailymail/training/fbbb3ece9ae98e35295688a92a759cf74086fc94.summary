by @entity0 published : 10:16 est , 23 october 2012 updated : 01:43 est , 24 october 2012 antibiotics are not effective in treating children ’s coughs caused by the common cold and may even slow recovery down			1
these were the conclusions of @entity7 researchers , who looked at the treatment of 305 children suffering such coughs			1
of the children , one group received antibiotics only , while another received combination of antibiotics and cough - suppressing medication			2
the rest of the children received nothing at all			0
they found those treated with both cough medicine and antibiotics recovered quicker than those just given antibiotics			1
children treated with both cough medicine and antibiotics recovered quicker than those just given antibiotics , who hate the same rate as those who were given no treatment but those given only antibiotics recovered no quicker than the children given nothing			1
the study was presented at annual meeting of the @entity38 this week			0
lead author @entity39 , of the @entity40 , said gps often wrote prescriptions for coughs to ‘ pacify parents ’			1
he added : ‘ however , antibiotics show very little effectiveness at treating cough due to your average head cold			1
’ ‘ few drugs are as effective as cough suppressants , and antibiotics are no more effective in relieving cough than the use of no medication			2
’ @entity57 guidance states that antibiotics are not used to treat coughs because they are only effective in killing bacteria , not viruses			0
therefore , unless you develop a secondary bacterial infection , such as pneumonia , antibiotics will not usually be advised			0
indeed , although antibiotics may not be an effective therapy for cough , they can be useful in treating underlying infections that may produce cough , said dr @entity39			0
‘ but this does not mean they should be overused			0
‘ using antibiotics as a treatment for cough without suspected infection is unnecessary and can be harmful			2
repeated use of antibiotics , especially when they are ineffective , can lead to adverse allergic reactions or a resistance to the medications			0

cough medicine is the best treatment for coughs caused by a common cold , say @entity7 researchers
gps simply give antibiotics to ' pacify parents , ' despite the fact they are ineffective
