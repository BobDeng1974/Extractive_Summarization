military chiefs yesterday admitted to putting down 109 of their horses in the past six years – a rate of more than one a month			1
the @entity3 said the animals had either become too sick or could not be found a new home			1
often the animals have to be put down because they fall lame or suffer from colic – but some are simply judged to have a bad temperament			0
the military keeps around 500 horses , which are used mainly for ceremonial occasions such as @entity13 and the @entity14			1
the military keeps around 500 horses , which cost more than £ 1million to maintain , but for every two that are rehomed , one is euthanised			1
pictured is a rehearsal for last year 's @entity13 these horses cost more than £ 1million to maintain , and when they fall ill a decision has to be taken on whether to spend more money on vets ’ fees or whether putting the animal down is the better choice			2
officials at the @entity3 try to find new homes for horses when they can not serve the military any more , but for every two animals that are rehomed another one is euthanised			1
among the horses that were put to sleep last year was an animal called @entity35 , who was suffering from an infected wound to the fetlock			2
others put down were @entity40 , who had a foot condition , @entity42 , who had a broken leg , @entity44 , who had chronic lameness and @entity47 , who was suffering from a disease of the immune system			0
as well as the 109 horses that were put down by the @entity3 since 2009 , a total of 526 military dogs have also been euthanised			1

three others , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 , were euthanised because of lameness			0
as well as the 109 horses that were put down by the @entity3 since 2009 , a total of 526 military dogs have also been euthanised			1
like the horses , these dogs had suffered injuries or could not be rehomed			2
@entity68 , director of animal welfare charity @entity69 , said : ‘ the @entity3 has no business using horses , dogs or any other animals			2
‘ they are not soldiers , nor are they pieces of military kit to be used and then decommissioned at the end of their involuntary service			0
‘ while painless euthanasia is the only humane option for sick or wounded animals , a combat zone is no place for them			0
’ a @entity3 spokesman said : ‘ the majority of our horses are re-homed at the end of their military service but our priority has to be the welfare of the animals			1
‘ sometimes , we sadly have to put down animals that are in pain , have debilitating diseases or are a danger to others			0
‘ that decision is only taken as a last resort , based on veterinary advice			0
they are not pieces of kit			0
