@entity0 said @entity5 ’s decision to vote down plans for strikes against @entity8 had ‘ not helped perceptions of the @entity2 being ready to defend itself ’ @entity10 's decision to block military action against @entity8 last year has ‘ emboldened ’ the @entity2 ’s enemies , @entity0 warned yesterday			1
the former foreign secretary said @entity5 ’s decision to vote down plans for retaliatory strikes against @entity8 had ‘ not helped perceptions of the @entity2 being ready to defend itself ’			1
mr @entity0 suggested @entity10 was now in danger of repeating the same error by demanding a @entity19 resolution on tackling @entity20 ( @entity21 ) in @entity8 before contemplating action in the country			1
he said it was completely unrealistic to demand a @entity26 resolution given @entity28 ’s public opposition and said it would be dangerous to get ‘ hung up ’ on the issue			1
mr @entity0 suggested ministers will now try to build the case for action in @entity8 before asking mps to vote on the issue			2
‘ there is n’t yet a political consensus on taking action , but we have n’t excluded that , ’ he said			0
@entity34 have so far only been asked to sanction bombing against @entity21 forces in @entity42 , partly because of @entity10 ’s caution over @entity8			1
but a string of ministers yesterday suggested the government could return to the issue of military action in @entity8 very soon			2
defence secretary @entity49 told @entity50 : ‘ @entity21 is based in @entity8 , it has been attacking @entity42 from @entity8 , and it needs to be defeated in @entity8 as well as @entity42			1
‘ we have not taken a decision on that yet			0
it is something we are going to review			0
we will see how that campaign goes , but in the end @entity21 do have to be defeated in @entity8			0
’ @entity58 said he had ‘ a lot of sympathy ’ for the argument that @entity60 needs to be involved in @entity8 as well as @entity42 , but said he had been constrained by the need to get a political ‘ consensus ’ at @entity65			2
the prime minister dismissed the need for @entity60 ground troops , saying : ‘ we ’re not trying to defeat @entity21 from the air alone			0
‘ we believe you do need troops on the ground , but they should be @entity42 troops , they should be @entity73 troops			0
’ and he dismissed calls to work with @entity8 tyrant @entity76 , saying he was ‘ part of the problem , not the solution ’			0
labour leader @entity5 , left , was instrumental in organising parliamentary opposition to airstrikes against the @entity8 government , led by dictator @entity76 , right , which has been fighting rebels including is shadow defence secretary @entity85 stressed that @entity10 supported the @entity87 - led air strikes in @entity8 , even though the party had set a series of further conditions before @entity60 action there could be considered			1
mr @entity85 said a ‘ much more cautious ’ approach was needed in @entity8 and said @entity10 would not ‘ give a blank cheque to the government ’			2
he said it was ‘ important ’ to seek a @entity26 resolution , adding : ‘ we need to understand that it ’s complex in @entity8 , it ’s difficult in @entity8			1
what is the outcome that we want to achieve ? ’			0

former foreign secretary warns @entity10 is in danger of repeating the error
the opposition has called for a @entity26 resolution before air strikes in @entity8
mps have so far been asked only to sanction airstrikes in @entity42
