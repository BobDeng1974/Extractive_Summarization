the powerful business select committee expressed astonishment that ministers did not know that @entity5 was being sued for undervaluing a toy firm a decade ago			1

booming : @entity6 revealed a doubling of profits today , as ministers and officials were grilled over the undervaluing of the firm when it was privatised last month @entity5 was a joint global co-ordinator of the float along with @entity26			1
the two investment banks have been accused of getting the valuation ‘ sizeably wrong ’ , with the firm priced at £ 3.3billion now valued at £ 5.6billion			2
today mr @entity15 was challenged on who signed off the price before the flotation last month			2
‘ ultimately i did , ’ he said			0
but mps on the @entity34 challenged the minister and his officials over why @entity5 was even involved in the process			2
last month the firm agreed a $ 7.5million settlement over the 1999 flotation of the online toy seller @entity41 , which it was claimed was undervalued by @entity5			1
shares quadrupled in value when they began trading , but two years late the firm had gone bust			2
grilling ministers and officials today , @entity47 mp @entity46 said : ‘ @entity5 has just settled a litigation case for £ 7.5m after it was accused of undervaluing an ipo			1
‘ were any of you aware of this at the time when making your assessment of the share price , and if so had you taken this into account when you appointed them as one of the float co-ordinators			0
’ @entity63 , chief executive of @entity64 which manages the government ’s stake , admitted : ‘ to answer your question we were not aware of that			0
’ @entity72 chairman @entity71 said : ‘ i find it quite astonishing that something that was publically available on @entity74 should be understood closely involved in the process			0
‘ from outside i have to say that appointing @entity5 on a flotation given this court case is a bit like asking @entity7 to have an appointment at @entity10			1
’ committee chairman @entity71 ( left ) said it was astonishing that ministers did not know about the @entity5 court case while business secretary @entity15 ( right ) said the buck stops with him for valuing shares at £ 3.30 @entity6 shares continued to rise today after the newly - listed company posted a big jump in half - year profits			1

in its first set of results as a listed company , @entity6 revealed operating profits nearly doubled to £ 283 million for the six months to september 29 from £ 144 million a year earlier , although figures were boosted by £ 95 million after a vat credit and lower - than - expected costs of its overhaul programme			0
the parcels business saw sales volumes growth grind to a halt as the summer heatwave slowed online purchases , while @entity6 also said the threat of strike action had since cost it business parcel customers in its key @entity117 quarter			0

mr @entity15 stuck by his previous description of the early gains as ' froth ' and said the true value of the shares would not emerge for months			2
the minister also took issue with any suggestion that banks had acted illegally , and told the @entity139 that the sale was good for the taxpayer and for the future of the six day a week delivery service offered by the @entity6			0
