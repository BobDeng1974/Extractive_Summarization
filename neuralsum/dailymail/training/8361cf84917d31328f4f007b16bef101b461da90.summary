by @entity0 a hungry lion cub was dealt a terrible punishment for being too keen to feast on a newly - slain buffalo when he got his head stuck in the creature 's backside			1
in his eagerness to pounce after his 18 - strong pride had brought down the beast , the baby became trapped in its rear end , unable to free itself			1
he thrashes every way possible , flipping himself over and pushing against the carcass with his paws , but none of his efforts pays off			0
eventually the speed of the movements slows down , and the cub lies still for several minutes , seemingly unconscious , in footage captured on a visit to @entity38 in @entity22			1
however , even though the cub 's fate seemed sealed after his struggles did no good , he appears to have eventually been saved by the efforts of his fellow lions			0
the other members of the pack , who seem wholly unconcerned during the filmed portion of his five - minute struggle , reportedly decided to save their friend by eating their way through the carcass			2
sticky situation : the cub flips itself upside - down and thrashes around with its paws , to no avail unconcerned : the lionesses who made the kill seem in no hurry to help the cub free as it pants heavily rescue mission ? though not shown in footage , the safari - goers who uploaded the video say they returned the next day to find the cub gone , seemingly freed after the lionesses ate through the carcass in an explanation added to the video , posted online in 2011 , the @entity71 user who uploaded the video explained that when they returned the next day the cub had escaped			1
the pride of lions was nowhere to be seen , but the carcass still bore the marks of what seems to have been a co-ordinated rescue attempt by the surrounding lionesses			0
the buffalo 's carcass had been eaten through , seemingly leaving enough space for the unlucky lion to make good his escape			2
the user , posting under the name @entity89 , said she was ' relieved ' that the cub seemed to have been freed .			0
