by @entity0 @entity1 was left furious after @entity2 failed to deliver a £ 60 bouquet to her mother , @entity5 you mess up @entity7 at your peril – and pay reputable florists a lot of money to make sure things go smoothly			0
spare a thought then for hundreds of @entity2 customers who ordered bouquets which were subsequently dumped on their mothers ’ doorsteps , arrived infested with bugs – or simply did n’t materialise at all			1
the flower delivery firm was forced to issue more than 100 apologies online after customers took to social networking sites to complain about poor service			1
@entity1 , 36 , was one of those left infuriated when the firm failed to deliver a £ 60 basket of flowers to her mother , @entity5 , 65			1
miss @entity1 lives in @entity27 and trusted the company to deliver her order directly to her parents ’ home in @entity32 , @entity33			0
but it never arrived , leaving her mother in tears			0
she said : ‘ i got an e-mail saying they had been delivered , so i rang mum to see if she liked them and it turned out they had n’t arrived			0
' i rang @entity2 and they said they would be with us in the next hour but they did n’t arrive at all			2
’ the response of the customer services team at @entity2 only angered miss @entity1 further			0
miss @entity1 , who works in marketing , said : ‘ i wanted to make my mum feel special			0
it would have been lovely if it had actually arrived			0
‘ but when i rang them they just kept saying it was a very small percentage of their orders that had a problem			0
what sort of excuse is that ? customers took to @entity60 to complain about the poor service and @entity2 made apologies every few minutes ' that may be the case but even if it is just 300 people on @entity7 that is far too many			1
’ yesterday angry customers flocked to online forums with complaints ranging from delivery issues to the quality of the flowers			1
@entity72 wrote on the company ’s @entity74 page bemoaning the difference between the flowers shown on the website and the ones delivered for her mother			2
she said : ‘ there are no flowers at all , the bowl is tiny and had fallen over so the plants were squashed			2
’ many customers were left outraged , having paid an extra fee to have their flowers delivered by midday – which never arrived at all			1
@entity92 wrote : ‘ ordered a @entity7 delivery online paid for it all and then received an e-mail saying that it wo n’t be delivered till monday , a bit late do n’t you think ? ’ other customers complained of flowers being ‘ dumped on the doorstep ’ when the door was n’t answered in time , and plants arriving infested with bugs			1
bizarrely , one mother found her flowers decked with black funeral ribbons			2
last night there was no statement from @entity2 despite repeated attempts to contact them			0
some customers had paid extra for @entity7 bouquets to arrive by midday and no flowers arrived at all			1

flower firm were making apologies every few minutes on their *official* @entity60
customers ' mothers received funeral flowers and had no bouquets arrive
