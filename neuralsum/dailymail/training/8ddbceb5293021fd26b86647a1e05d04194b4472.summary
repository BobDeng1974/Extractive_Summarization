by @entity0 cheating technique : ' @entity2 ' involves students swapping synonyms from the @entity5 to cover up plagiarism ‘ sinister buttocks ’ , ‘ herculean liturgies ’ and ‘ bequest mazes ’ may not be the phrases @entity8 expected to be created when he launched his world - famous thesaurus			1
but a university lecturer has identified a new trend of ‘ @entity2 ’ among students – the creation of absurd terms through ill - considered use of @entity5			1
they are using the technique , involving extensive synonym swapping , in a bid to hide plagiarism - but are producing baffling sentences as a result			1
@entity26 , principal lecturer in business information systems at @entity28 , suggested the new word after spotting several ‘ @entity31 ’ in a students ’ work			1
after reading that ‘ common mature musicians ( and ) recent liturgy providers are looking to satisfy … herculean personalised liturgies ’ , he attempted to discover the source of the sentence ’s origin			2
he said : ‘ even if the sentence had made sense , it seemed out of place in ( a paper on ) business information systems and i was motivated to seek out the source			0
’ mr @entity26 eventually located the original text , which read : ‘ the current big players and new service providers are looking to supply more powerful personalised services ’			1
he told the @entity49 magazine he had ‘ seen quite a bit ’ of ‘ @entity2 ’ , which he defined as ‘ disguising plagiarism by substituting synonyms , one word at a time with no attempt to understand either the source or target text ’			1
as a result , the phrase ‘ left behind ’ was converted into ‘ sinister buttocks ’ by one student			2
to ‘ stay ahead of the competition ’ became ‘ to tarry fore of the conflict ’ , while ‘ new market leaders ’ was turned into ‘ modern store guides ’			0
other new phrases coined by students via ‘ @entity2 ’ include ‘ bequest mazes ’ – a rough translation of ‘ legacy networks ’ which describe web networks using outdated computer formats			1
mr @entity26 entered the blunders into the @entity49 exam howlers competition			2
he said : ‘ this was a sad business for me and especially ( for ) my student , but i do think ‘ sinister buttocks ’ deserves a prize			0
’ the winner of the annual contest was @entity82 , lecturer in education at the @entity84 for his student ’s claim that ‘ the [ hole in the ] ozone layer was caused by a * * * * * * * s. dr @entity82 said : ‘ he probably meant aerosols , but then … maybe not			0
’ his second student blooper from this season ’s marking season was a student ’s declaration in a paper on vehicle emissions that ‘ in future all cars ( will ) be fitted with @entity101 converters ’			0
confusion : @entity103 , a lecturer at @entity28 , coined the term after a number of his students handed in work with baffling sentences @entity109 , information technology programme director at the @entity111 , entered the statement that @entity113 was ‘ one of the two main suppositories of data in the world ’			1
meanwhile , @entity118 , a lecturer in business and government at @entity121 , was intrigued to read that the @entity123 government had a ‘ toff stance on tax avoidance ’			0
she noted that the student actually meant ‘ tuff ’ ( tough )			0
@entity8 , a @entity128 physician and lexicographer , published the @entity130 ( @entity5 ) in 1852			2
he was obsessed with list - making from an early age and his work on the thesaurus arose partly from his attempt to battle depression .			0
