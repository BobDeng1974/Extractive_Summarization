by @entity0 for @entity1 there is a new chef in town who plans to give @entity5 a run for his money			0
the cooking - maestro , named @entity9 , has been impressing crowds in @entity11 with its broccoli mango soup , chocolate burritos and @entity15 bacon cake			1
but @entity9 is n't any ordinary chef			0
it is , in fact , a supercomputer who originally rose to fame after beating quiz show champion @entity22 at @entity23			1
click below to view @entity9 's recipes @entity9 , created by @entity25 , uses a database of tried - and - tested recipes from around the world			1
it then combines this with information about which flavours are present in ingredients , and uses something called ' hedonic perception theory ' to model how humans react to its recipes			0
chefs begin by inputting a main ingredient , such as apple for instance , as well as a regional cuisine such as @entity44			0
@entity9 then flips through a nearly endless database of recipes			0
the offbeat list of ingredients @entity9 spits out may not always sound delicious - suggesting apples has coaxed @entity9 to produce the offbeat garlicky , pork loin - laced @entity50			2
but it is the taste that matters			0
it then created a broccoli soup with mango chunks , orange juice and cider			1
this was followed by a bottle of @entity87 butternut barbecue sauce on the side and a @entity90 chickpea ragout			0
dessert came in the form of a green - tea pudding with whiskey , tapioca and cardamom			1
' the soup sounds awful ' , @entity97 , a two @entity98 star chef told @entity100 at the @entity101			0
' but my palate tells me the green - tea pudding would work			1
' @entity105 @entity104 et voila ! chef 's enter a main ingredients and a regional cuisine of their choice milk : 255 g , divided butter : 44 g , divided molasses : 28 g @entity114 : 1 tsp nutmeg : 0.3 g very @entity117 : 170 g , very ripe , medium dice @entity119 : 3 @entity120 : 45 g flour : 14 g @entity123 : 17 g coconut flakes : 28 g orange juice : 113 g cayenne pepper papaya : 128 g , small dice corn oil : for deep frying @entity132 : 1 , very cold @entity133 off beat : while many of the recipes might sound odd , the @entity25 chefs say they 've all tasted delicious @entity137 @entity139 eggplant : 1 kg , about 3 @entity140 : 8 g dried @entity141 : 1 g @entity142 @entity143 : 10 g @entity144 , @entity145 : 6 g @entity133 : 6 g coarsely @entity146 : 100 g @entity147 : 28 g , tops removed , sliced cumin : @entity149 @entity151 @entity150 : 1 g @entity140 : 2 g baguette : 24 thin slices @entity155 flower oil @entity156 : @entity25 anticipates that @entity9 will offer virtually unlimited recipe combinations to amateur and professional chefs alike one day soon @entity160 - @entity159 butter : 5.5 oz , divided water : 2.9 oz , divided @entity119 : 2 , divided @entity133 : 1.5 tsp , divided @entity164 flour : 8 oz , sifted lemongrass : .4 oz , thinly sliced leeks : 4 oz , white part only asparagus tips : 28 , 2.5 " long eggs : 3 heavy cream : 7.5 oz plain whole - milk yogurt : 7.5 oz @entity171 : 3/8 tsp ground coriander seeds : 1/4 tsp @entity173 : 1/8 tsp feta : 2 oz , crumbled @entity175 : 1.5 oz , grated @entity177 : 1/2 tbsp , finely chopped @entity178 tastes : the @entity9 food truck had its debut at a @entity182 technology show in march			1
the truck ( pictured ) is now cooking up its recipes at @entity25 's research headquarters in @entity11 as well as the billions of combinations @entity9 can come up with , having the chefs there to decide how to use the ingredients makes for even more possibilities			1
' two different chefs can get the same list of ingredients and come up with completely different dishes , ' @entity191 , one of the chefs working with @entity9 and @entity25 , told the @entity133			1
the chef is n't afraid of losing his job to the supercomputer , though			0
he told the @entity133 that sometimes a list of ingredients will have all the best flavours but none of the all - important aspect of a great dish , texture			2
' you can end up with a list of ingredients , and none of them has an element of crispiness , ' he said			0
@entity25 is showing off @entity9 's diverse skill sets as position themselves to make the @entity216 's benefits available to businesses and individuals			2
the company said its new @entity221 - based business unit devoted soley to @entity9 will be dedicated to the development and commercialisation of the project that first gained fame by defeating a pair of ‘ @entity23 ! ’ champions , including 74 - time winner @entity22 , in 2011			2
in the years since @entity9 's tv appearance , @entity25 has been developing the supercomputer for more practical purposes and changed it to a cloud - based service			1
its massive computing capabilities once took a device the size of a room , but @entity9 is now the size of three stacked pizza boxes , according to @entity238			0
@entity25 claims @entity9 is unique because it it 's programmed like traditional computers , but uses artificial intelligence to learn from its past experiences and factor this information into its future operations			2
‘ @entity25 has transformed @entity9 from a quiz - show winner , into a commercial cognitive computing breakthrough that is helping businesses engage customers , healthcare organisations personalise patient care , and entrepreneurs build businesses , ’ said @entity245 , who heads the @entity246			1
@entity25 chief executive @entity255 said that @entity9 is built for a world where big data is transforming every industry and every profession			2
‘ @entity9 does more than find the needle in the haystack , ’ @entity255 said in remarks released ahead of the @entity262 's unveiling			0
‘ it understands the haystack			0
’ more practical than @entity23 : @entity25 has been thinking big when it comes to @entity9 and since its 2011 @entity23 win against champs including @entity22 , the firm has created a @entity221 - based arm of the company specifically geared toward putting the supercomputer to use for businesses and consumers small but powerful : its massive computing capabilities once took a device the size of a room , but @entity9 is now the size of three stacked pizza boxes			1

@entity9 is a supercomputer that beat quiz show champion @entity22
@entity25 is using it to think up unique and strange dishes that taste good
it recently cooked broccoli soup with mango and a green - tea pudding
human chefs first suggest a dish , then @entity9 makes decides ingredients
it then creates a recipe from which chefs cook the food for diners
