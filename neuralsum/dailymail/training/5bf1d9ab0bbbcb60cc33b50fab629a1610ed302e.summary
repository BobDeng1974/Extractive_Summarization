and the row between @entity12 and @entity1 was no exception – although it also involved a stepladder , a drenching with a hosepipe and two trips to court			0
the saga began when mrs @entity2 , 49 , climbed up her stepladder to trim the leylandii branches which overhang her garden from mr @entity1 ’s side of the fence			1
with her electric hedge cutters in hand , she was suddenly hit by a huge jet of water when 39 - year - old plumber mr @entity1 turned on his hosepipe			1
the jet hit mrs @entity2 full in the face , knocking her off the ladder			2
she fell five feet into a flower bed , hurting her knee , and was so upset she ran to another neighbour ’s house and asked her to call the police			0
mr @entity1 was charged with the offence of common assault , which has a maximum sentence of up to six months in jail			2
in january he was convicted of battery , fined £ 300 and ordered to pay mrs @entity2 £ 100 compensation plus £ 790 in costs			1
but the story was not over yet			0
he then appealed the conviction , saying it was an accident and he had not intended to hit mrs @entity2			2
now his conviction has been overturned by an appeal judge at @entity51 , who believed his version of events			0
mrs @entity2 lives in a £ 250,000 four - bedroom house in the village of @entity57 , @entity58 , with her husband @entity59 , the managing director of an events and exhibition firm			1
@entity2 , 39 , left , says she was knocked off her ladder by mr @entity1 's hose as she trimmed the hedge mrs @entity2 was clipping the leylandi hedge seen here between her house ( on the left ) and mr @entity1 's @entity69 , prosecuting , told the court that the couple ’s house backed on to mr @entity1 ’s £ 190,000 dormer bungalow , and they share a border made up of his leylandii hedge and their wooden fence			1
miss @entity69 said the couple ’s garden fence was ‘ somewhat lower ’ than the hedge and the leylandii ‘ protruded significantly ’ over it			0
' for the offence of battery to be made out , the @entity83 had to demonstrate ... that there was an intentional or reckless application of force ' - recorder @entity90 on the day of the incident , neighbours @entity92 and @entity93 heard mrs @entity2 using the trimmers from inside their house next door , the court was told			1
mrs @entity93 , 68 , saw mr @entity1 using a hosepipe and said he appeared to be trying to get water over the hedge deliberately			1
her husband , 70 , claimed he saw mr @entity1 squeezing the end of the pipe , as if trying to get more pressure , before aiming for the ladder			2
but mr @entity1 denied any deliberate assault on his neighbour , and told officers he could not hear her using the hedge trimmers			1
mrs @entity2 lives in a four - bedroomed house in the village of @entity57 in the @entity112 mr @entity1 , whose house is pictured , said he did not realise it was better to water a hedge 's roots than its top yesterday mrs @entity2 said she did not want to talk about the case , and instead wanted to consult with police and @entity120			1
but mr @entity1 claimed the incident had occurred against a background of ill feeling between the two neighbours which began when he built a conservatory			2
mr @entity1 said : ‘ it was all rather silly and it ’s very unfortunate the matter got as far as it did at a crown court			0
‘ i ’ve always wanted to be a good neighbour			0
i ’ve never had any complaints before and get on well with my other neighbours – but things simply have n’t worked out between myself and mrs @entity2			0
‘ it has just been a nonsense and a complete farce			0
now i ’m going to have to be very careful if i want to water my hedge and will have to get my girlfriend to video me doing it in future			0

neighbour @entity1 , 39 , says he did *n't* realise mother - of - two was there
