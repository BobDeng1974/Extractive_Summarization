it also had interior door panels missing , a faulty horn , ' stretched and worn ' balding tyres which were the wrong size and an anti-lock braking system that did not work			1
the car , which was scratched and dented , was seized and impounded and a further examination revealed it had a quick release steering wheel , to help get in and out of the vehicle quicker			1
@entity0 , of @entity27 in @entity28 , pleaded guilty to dangerous driving at @entity30 , and was given a year - long ban with an extended test and 80 hours community work			1
but the unemployed welder , who was driving at around 28mph when he was pulled over in august last year , has hit out at his conviction , claiming police made ' an example ' of him			1
@entity0 , who paid £ 550 for the car in 2013 , is part of a car club that holds track races , car shows and family fun days and described himself as a ' competent driver ' who would never put others at risk			1
he said : ' all of the modifications that were made to my car were done so for the shows and races that i take part in			1
i kept it in very good condition			0
' on the day that i was pulled over i was driving within the speed limit			2
my sister @entity56 was heavily pregnant at the time and i would not put her or anyone else at risk by driving a car which i believed to be unsafe			2
i am a competent driver and i pay my tax , insurance and @entity63			0
' i do n't drink or smoke or go out causing trouble			0
i have never been in trouble with the police before but now i have a criminal record for dangerous driving and it will ruin job prospects for me in the future			1
' i am a massive car enthusiast and i have been modifying cars ever since i passed my driving test five years ago			2
police found his modified @entity3 had several defects after he was stopped on a coastal road in @entity11 his car had electrical wires dangling from where the glove box should have been and interior door panels missing			1
he also had a removable steering wheel to make getting in and out of the car easier ( all pictured ) ' my @entity3 had a number of modifications but it had passed its @entity63 two months before i was pulled over so i had no reason to assume it was n't safe to drive			1
' i used to use the car for shows , drifting and track races , so i removed the interior panels to make the car more lightweight and added a free - flowing exhaust to extract more power from the engine			1
' the wires that were on show were cable tied and secure and there are no laws which say mechanisms can not be on show			0
it makes no difference to the car			0
' he added that he had intended to take the car off the road after noticing the handbrake was locking one wheel instead of two but had been asked to drive the car as part of a funeral procession			2
the balding tyres were ' stretched and worn ' and were not even the correct size for the vehicle ( pictured ) @entity0 , of @entity27 in @entity28 , pleaded guilty to dangerous driving at @entity30 , and was given a year - long ban with an extended test and 80 hours community work after the car ( above ) was seized @entity0 , who has owned 25 cars since passing his driving test five years ago , said : ' a week before i was pulled over i had a bump on the tracks when i was drifting			1
i repaired it , drove it home and parked it up			0
' a couple of days later i was asked to drive the car as part of a funeral procession , so i did that and the next day i was pulled over			0
' bmws have a common fault with the handbrake			0
i have had 70s and 80s cars and not one of them has had anti-lock breaks			0
if i genuinely thought the car was unsafe it would n't have been on the road			2
' i now accept that the tyres were really bad and there 's no excuse for that			0
it was a lack of judgement on my part			0
' the motor enthusiast , who paid £ 550 for the car in 2013 , is part of a car club that holds track races , car shows and family fun days but the unemployed welder , who was driving within the limit when he was stopped , has since hit out at police his lawyer @entity162 said : ' mr @entity0 readily accepts the car was n't up to a proper standard			1
' he 's genuinely sorry for what he has done because as a car enthusiast he does realise he should have taken greater care to make sure his vehicle was in a proper condition			0
there 's no suggestion he was stopped for any poor driving			2
' @entity174 @entity173 , from @entity175 , said : ' the car was completely unfit for road use			2
it is only lucky that this vehicle was not involved in a serious collision as it was a death trap			0
' i urge all motorists to ensure their vehicles are fit for road use so as to avoid prosecution and maintain road safety			0
