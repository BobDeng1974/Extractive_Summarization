what an absolute joke that was			2
it should never have reached the stage where they were involving lawyers , defendants and witnesses , like some serious court case			2
it was like @entity11 ’s circus ! a bloke ’s been pushed , for goodness ’ sake			0
and it did n’t even happen on the field of play			0
that would have been different , but why they ’ve made such a song and dance over this , @entity18 only knows			0
in terms of sledging , i do n’t see @entity26 as being any worse than most fast bowlers to have played the game			1
if a few words are a crime , then guys like @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 would never have got a game			0
man up ! shake hands and move on , which is what they ’ve done after each @entity55 so far			0
after all , it was n’t as if @entity26 flattened @entity39 in full view of the crowd			1
people have asked me whether this is good for @entity62 , but i think it ’s good for cricket			1
delight : @entity26 can not hide his emotions after dismissing @entity39 at the @entity67 waste of time : charges against @entity72 all - rounder @entity39 were also dropped after the hearing it ’s 1 - 1 , and things will be tasty at @entity76 , which is how it should be			1
it absolutely beggars belief that it even got to this stage			0
i think it was right that @entity39 ’s charge was overturned too			1
but i ca n’t help thinking he should take his tattoos and ear - rings back home to his aunty and get on with the game ! it ’s all anyone cares about .			2

charges that @entity26 assaulted @entity39 were thrown out
@entity62 bowler was accused of pushing *batsman* after first @entity97
@entity72 all - rounder @entity39 was also found not *guilty* of any offence
@entity62 levelled the series after *victory* at the @entity67 , @entity104
farcical *episode* has left @entity72 *embarrassed*
