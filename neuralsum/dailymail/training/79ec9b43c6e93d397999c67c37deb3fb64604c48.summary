@entity9 , 33 , from @entity10 , stands at nearly 7ft tall and weighs 400lbs having suffered from the rare pituitary disorder acromegaly for over a decade			1
efforts to treat the condition , that causes the body to produce too much growth hormone , remained unsuccessful until now , and ms @entity9 , who was a slender 5ft 8 and 130lbs at the age of 21 , continued to grow			1
rare disorder : @entity9 was a slender 5ft 8 and 130lbs as a teenager , pictured here in 1995 ( left )			1
by 2010 ( right ) , she was 6ft 6in and 480lbs			0
only now have doctors successfully managed to cease her growth over the past year , however , ms @entity9 has been treated with a new drug , that has finally helped regulate her growth hormone levels			1
acromegaly , which affects 20,000 people in the @entity27 , is usually caused by a non-cancerous tumour on the pituitary gland			2
ms @entity9 has undergone radiation and surgery three times in an effort to have hers removed , but , as it is wrapped around her carotid artery , it has proved too difficult			2
if left untreated , acromegaly can be life - threatening , as it causes organs such as the heart and lungs to grow along with height and weight			1
sufferers are at higher risk of developing diabetes and high blood pressure , while the pressure on their joints causes swelling and early onset of osteoarthritis			0
new treatment : the 33 - year - old , from @entity10 , has finally stopped growing at nearly 7ft tall , having struggled to find a way to halt the effects of her acromegaly for over a decade dr. @entity56 , professor of medicine and neurosurgery at @entity59 in @entity60 , told @entity61 : ' their mortality rate is two to four times greater than the general population			1
' describing the symptoms of acromegaly , which is not hereditary , dr @entity56 said : ' everything gets thicker and the facial features become abnormal			0
' ms @entity9 , for now , is thrilled by the improvement in her condition			0
she told @entity71 : ' this is such good news			0
' change : photographs of ms @entity9 ages 17 ( left ) and 31 ( right ) reveal how acromegaly has affected her face healthier times : before her acromegaly diagnosis , ms @entity9 was a keen horserider her mother , @entity79 added : ' this gives us renewed hope			1
' despite the improvement in her condition , ms @entity9 's acromegaly has taken a serious toll on her health			1
she can barely walk and is in constant pain when she does - the only place she feels relief is a swimming pool , where the pressure on her joints is eased			0
one surgery caused a stroke that severely damaged her hearing , another 13 - hour procedure nearly killed her			0
helping hands : ms @entity9 pictured with her medical team and her mother ( in white ) in 2010 it is a far cry from ms @entity9 as a energetic 21 - year - old , a keen horse - rider who loved dancing			1
then 5ft 8in and 130lbs , she began to notice that her clothes no longer fit her , and her hands had become enlarged			1
renewed hope : ms @entity9 's mother , @entity79 ' she was perfectly normal , but by age 22 she had grown three inches , ' her mother revealed			1
' nobody knew what was going on			0
' ms @entity9 , who had been working as a supervisor at a @entity112 in @entity113 , was fired from her post when her head grew larger , and was dumped by her boyfriend when his parents questioned whether she was a man			0
not long afterwards , in 2002 , she moved home to @entity10 where a doctor quickly diagnosed her acromegaly			2
though she admits her appearance upsets her , ms @entity9 hopes to inspire others with the same condition - indeed , she already receives many messages of support			2
' i read emails that people send in saying , " you 're my inspiration , " or , " you are so strong , " ' she told @entity61			0
