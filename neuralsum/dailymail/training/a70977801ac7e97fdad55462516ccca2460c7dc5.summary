by @entity0 published : 13:03 est , 4 september 2013 updated : 13:04 est , 4 september 2013 researchers have discovered a protein that they claim is the missing link to the development of alzheimer ’s disease			0
they found that blocking this protein with an existing drug can restore memory in mice with brain damage that mimics the disease			2
the findings could offer hope of developing drugs to slow the degenerative illness			1
@entity15 's causes a decrease in the size of the brain , shown here by the enlarged ventricle cavities ( white , at centre of brain ) and the widened pale blue regions			1
researchers now believe they have found the ' missing link ' that triggers the disease ' what is very exciting is that of all the links in this molecular chain , this is the protein that may be most easily targeted by drugs , ' said the study ’s senior author @entity33 at @entity35			0
the study offers hope of developing drugs to slow the degenerative illness ' this gives us strong hope that we can find a drug that will work to lessen the burden of @entity15 ’s			1
' during @entity15 's disease protein ' plaques ' develop in the structure of the brain , leading to the death of brain cells			1
people with @entity15 's also have a shortage of some important chemicals in their brain involved with the transmission of messages within the brain			2
scientists have already provided a partial molecular map of how alzheimer ’s disease destroys brain cells			0
in earlier work , professor @entity33 ’s lab showed that the amyloid - beta peptides , which are a hallmark of @entity15 ’s , couple with prion proteins			0
by an unknown process , the coupling activates a molecular messenger called @entity67			0
the new findings , published in the journal @entity70 , reveals the missing link in the chain , a protein within the cell membrane called metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 , or @entity76			1
when the protein is blocked by a drug similar to one being developed for @entity82 , the deficits in memory , learning , and synapse density were restored in a mouse model of @entity15 ’s			1
prof @entity33 stressed that new drugs may have to be designed to precisely target the amyloid - prion disruption of @entity76 in human cases of @entity15 ’s and said his lab is exploring new ways to achieve this			2
alzheimer 's disease is the most common cause of dementia , currently affecting around 496,000 people in the @entity94 .			0

blocking the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 protein may repair memory
tests have shown that it restores learning in mouse model of @entity15 's
findings could help develop drugs to slow the degenerative illness
