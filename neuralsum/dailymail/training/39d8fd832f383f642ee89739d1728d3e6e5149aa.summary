@entity1 ceo @entity0 wept on monday as she met with families of people killed in auto accidents involving @entity1 cars that are included in a growing list of recalls @entity0 met with 15 families of people killed in recalled @entity1 vehicles at the car manufacturer 's @entity13 office on the eve of a congressional hearing looking into the several vehicles the company was forced to recall after it linked 31 crashes - and 13 deaths - to the vehicles ' faulty ignition switches			1
the families reportedly showed @entity25 new photos of those killed in crashes linked to the recalled vehicles , a list that now includes @entity29 , @entity30 and others			1
somber : @entity1 ceo @entity0 wept as she met with families of people killed in recalled @entity1 vehicles ' we went around the table , family by family , and told stories about our loved ones who ca n’t speak for themselves , ' @entity42 resident @entity41 - whose stepdaughter @entity43 , 18 , was killed in a 2005 @entity45 - told the @entity44			1
the ignition switches on the recalled vehicles can inadvertently move out of position , which can disable the vehicles ' airbags			1
' it was helpful for us to put @entity43 and @entity53 ’s face on it and talk to @entity0 about them , ' @entity41 said			1
' they are not just 13 victims			2
' @entity0 agreed to meet with the families ahead of the hearing at the request of attorney @entity61 , who represents the families of two of those killed in collisions involving recalled @entity1 vehicles			1
according to @entity66 , the mother of 16 - year - old @entity67 , who was killed in 2005 in a crash involving a @entity45 , @entity0 apologized during the meeting , telling the paper that the ceo ' said , " i 'm sorry , " an awful lot			1
' ' she may have been very sincere , but all of this is coming after we lost someone that nothing can replace , ' @entity72 said			2
recalled : one of several vehicles on the recall list is the 2005 @entity45 additionally , she says @entity0 did not agree with her opinion that the vehicles are dangerous and need to be taken off the road			1
' i asked her about getting the cars off the road , and she told me the cars are safe , ' @entity72 said			2
@entity1 maintains that the recalled vehicles can still be driven while they await parts			1
the families of those killed wanted to meet with the ceo to make sure that @entity0 ' could not turn away from the human side of this			1
' the hearings begin as one thing is becoming clear : of those killed , the majority were young			2
in a way , this is n't surprising			2
low - priced cars like the @entity45 and @entity101 were marketed to young , first - time buyers and parents shopping for their kids			1
but price may not be the only reason for the disproportionate number of youthful deaths			2
this combination of undated family photos shows , from left , @entity67 , @entity43 , and @entity112			2
all three were killed in deadly car crashes involving @entity1 's @entity45 during 2005 - 2006			1
the complaint tally for the top - selling small cars in the 2005 - 2007 model years was : @entity117 , 228 ; @entity45 , 164 ; @entity118 , 60 ; @entity119 , 25 ; and the @entity120 , 19			1
( @entity121 photo ) the faulty ignition switches behind the recall can shut off the engine while the car is in motion			2
when that happens , power - assisted steering and power brakes are lost , and the air bags wo n't inflate in a crash			2
in such a situation , inexperienced drivers are more likely to panic and be overwhelmed by the extra effort needed to control the car , safety experts say			2
@entity1 has linked 13 deaths to the problem			1
others have a higher total , with the majority of victims under age 25			0
many also were women , who safety experts say are less likely to have the upper body strength to wrestle a stalled car safely to the side of the road			0
' with an entry - level car where you have a newly licensed driver , the freak - out will win the day , ' said @entity154 , a @entity155 personal injury lawyer who is suing @entity1 in several cases			1
' all that those young drivers are going to do is respond to the panic			0
' @entity1 has admitted knowing for at least a decade that the switches were defective			1
yet it did n't start recalling 2.6 million @entity161 , ions and other small cars worldwide until february			0
@entity0 has said @entity1 's safety processes were lacking , and she has brought in an outside attorney to review them			1
through media reports and contacts on a @entity169 page , @entity170 , whose daughter was killed in a 2005 @entity174 wreck in which a @entity45 air bag did n't inflate , has found crashes that claimed 29 lives			1
of those , 15 were under age 25 , and 18 were women			0
according to the @entity182 , drivers ages 16 to 24 were involved in 23 percent of the 35,306 fatal crashes in the @entity184 in 2012			2
relatives of many who died will attend congressional hearings on the matter tuesday and wednesday , and many will wear @entity190 with @entity67 's picture			1
@entity0 will appear as a witness and again issue a public apology , according to her prepared testimony			1
first : @entity0 was named ceo of @entity1 in january , making her the first female ceo of a major global automaker unlike drivers from previous generations , young people do n't know what it 's like to drive without power steering , safety experts say			1
even some older drivers could be startled when power steering goes away			0
data suggest parents buy the small cars for their kids			0
for instance , 68 percent of people who now own @entity29 are 35 to 64 years old , according to the @entity213 automotive website			0
many of those buyers were at an age when they had teenage children , said @entity218 , senior analyst at @entity219			0
plus , many parents had the car title put in their names to reduce insurance costs , he said			0
@entity213 also said most buyers had household incomes under $ 100,000			0
that made the @entity45 appealing , because in most years it sold for a little over $ 15,000 , or $ 1,000 to $ 3,500 less than the two top - selling small cars , the @entity117 and @entity118 , according to @entity213			1
parents also complained to @entity1 and the government about the cars on behalf of their children			1
in a june 2005 letter to @entity29 customer service , later forwarded to federal safety regulators , a @entity233 mother said a 2005 @entity45 stalled three times while being driven by her daughter			1
she said the problem was obvious : ' the problem is the ignition turn switch is poorly installed			0
even with the slightest touch , the car will shut off while in motion			0
' besides being affordable , the @entity1 cars had four - or five - star ratings in most government crash test categories			1
tragic : @entity43 was one of two women killed in a crash involving a 2005 @entity45 @entity1 's marketing of the @entity101 and @entity45 clearly was aimed at young people			1
ion ads from the time posted on @entity254 showed the car taking young passengers away from high school or childhood			0
a @entity45 ad portrayed the @entity45 as a renegade younger brother , bumping a @entity262 in the rear and provoking a reaction from its older sibling			1
@entity267 's parents helped her buy a shiny black 2004 @entity101 when she was 16 and growing up in @entity268 , @entity42 ' at the time , it really had high safety ratings , ' she recalled			1
' it had good gas mileage , and it was what we could afford			0
' the @entity101 soon began stalling for no reason			0
each time , the car became difficult to steer and the key had slipped out of the " run " position			0
' it went from being able to steer with two fingers to using all of my ability to pull off and keep away from the intersection and get out of oncoming traffic , ' said @entity286 , now 26			0
even after repeated trips to the dealership 's service department , the @entity101 kept stalling			2
@entity286 had a near - miss on a freeway entrance ramp , where a driver behind her was able to steer around the @entity101			0
he made an obscene gesture as he passed , she remembered			0
another trip to the dealer			0
then , as she was making a left turn a safe distance in front of an oncoming bus , the engine stalled again , she said			0
sad : 16 - year - old @entity304 was killed when the airbags failed to deploy when she crashed her 2005 @entity45 ' i thought i was going to get t - boned by the bus			1
i refused to drive the car again until i felt like it was safe , ' she said			0
the dealer replaced the starter and alternator			0
at the same time , @entity286 stopped using a lanyard as her keychain			0
she got rid of the @entity101 and bought a @entity118 as soon as she graduated from college and got a job			0
@entity1 has said the ignition can switch off if people have long , heavy keychains , sometimes if their knees brush against the keys			1
@entity286 's lanyard had two keys and the remote control for the car 's doors			2
in 2005 , @entity1 notified dealers that the cars could stall because of the ignition switches			1
but @entity1 did n't recall the cars , theorizing that even in a stall , people could still steer and brake without the power systems			2
because her car stalled so much , @entity286 knew she could still steer it			0
but other young people might not be able to handle such a situation , according to safety experts			0
most driver education curriculums cover a loss of power steering , said @entity347 , manager of driver education for the @entity349			0
while some instructors have students practice in cars , many just cover it in the classroom , and it 's unclear whether the young drivers retain the information , he said			2
young drivers have a high crash risk because of inexperience and immaturity , said @entity363 , senior vice president of research for the @entity182			0
' i think emergency situations bring out both of those , ' she said			0
they may not have as much cool , or presence of mind as an adult might have			0

@entity1 ceo @entity0 met with the families at the company 's @entity13 office
@entity0 is set to testify before a congressional hearing looking into several recalled @entity1 vehicles
31 crashes and 13 deaths have been *attributed* to several recalled @entity386 , including the @entity45 and the @entity30
