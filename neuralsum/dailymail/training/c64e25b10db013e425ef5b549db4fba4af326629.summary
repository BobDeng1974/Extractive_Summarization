in a scene reminiscent of the famous @entity10 moment in @entity12 's @entity11 , the two @entity7 began to swallow a mouse only to realise they were both scoffing the same meal			2
after a few moments of struggle the smaller snake gave up when it realised what was on the other end of the pray			0
dinner time : the two snakes tussle over one mouse - ending up at either ends of the meal the amusing moment was captured by wildlife photographer @entity26 while on a trip to the @entity28 - a @entity29 in @entity30			1
mr @entity26 , from @entity31 , @entity30 , said : ' my girlfriend and i had gone out for a viewing of @entity30 's then - largest pride of @entity36 at @entity37 , which on its own is amazing to see			1
' it was my first time there and we got told they had a cave tour where people could interact with certain @entity44 naturally , being up for anything , off we went			0
' i 'd never seen a @entity7 eat anything , unfortunately i was n't there in time to catch the kill but just in time to see the poised snake come out to investigate the rat , even though it was already halfway down the other 's throat			0
a more appetising meal : the dogs in @entity12 's @entity11 enjoy a spaghetti dinner for two ' the problem was that the snake on the right got the foot of the rat stuck in the one corner of his mouth , so could n't get it down before the smaller snake on the left came sniffing and tasting			0
' mr @entity26 named the picture ' dinner for two ' and says he is used to wildlife			1
he added : ' i was fortunate to grow up in and around the @entity30 bush so i 've always been a ' bush monkey			2
' ' i love and respect everything that is nature and all the surprises it could bring at the blink of an eye			0
' photographer : @entity26 ( pictured ) grabbed the amazing images of the snakes while on a trip with his girlfriend			1
