a shortage of midwives and beds is resulting in ' conveyor - belt ' healthcare according to experts new mothers are sent home from hospital more quickly in @entity9 than anywhere else in the @entity11			1
a shortage of midwives and beds is resulting in ‘ conveyor - belt ’ care that can put mother and baby ’s health at risk , experts warn			2
the average hospital stay for a normal delivery in @entity9 is just 1.5 days , a major report revealed yesterday , compared with an @entity11 average of 3.6			1
@entity25 mothers typically stay for 4.2 days , while in @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 they stay for five			1
@entity9 ’s maternity wards have been under pressure for years , largely because the birth rate has outstripped government expectations – rising by almost a quarter in the last decade – meaning not enough midwives have been recruited			0
staff are concerned that too many exhausted mothers are sent home before they have properly recovered from labour , or got to grips with basic baby care			1
yesterday ’s @entity40 report states : ‘ the average length of stay for a normal delivery in @entity11 countries ranges from less than two days , in the @entity9 and the @entity45 , to five days or more in [ @entity28 ] , @entity27 and @entity26			1
’ it warns : ‘ too short a stay could also cause adverse effects on health outcomes , or reduce the comfort and recovery of the patient			0
’ @entity53 , general secretary of the @entity54 , said : ‘ midwives are under pressure to get women home earlier and earlier ... women in labour are basically queuing for a bed , so those in the post-natal wards have to be discharged far more quickly than we would like			2
’ she added : ‘ midwives say too often it feels conveyor belt - like ... they are under pressure to get a woman out and home			0
’ @entity70 of the @entity71 said : ‘ this is a complex issue ... having a short stay may be the right thing for women who ’ve had straightforward births as they often feel better at home			2
’ however , she added it is ‘ crucial that women are not sent home before they are ready due to a lack of hospital staff , or leave because they want to get away from chaotic postnatal wards ’			2
@entity84 , @entity85 mp for @entity86 , said : ‘ even @entity87 was allowed to stay in the stable for longer than one - and - a - half days ... what the government needs to do is recruit more midwives			0
’ the study , which examined every @entity11 nation except @entity94 , found that stays have become shorter ‘ in nearly all countries over the past decade ’ , with @entity9 ’s average falling from 1.8 days in 2000			0
the report did not distinguish between first babies and subsequent pregnancies , which typically result in quicker deliveries			0
dr @entity102 , clinical director for maternity at @entity104 , said : ‘ although many women prefer to go home as soon as possible , it is vital that they receive the care and support they need after they give birth			0
‘ this is why new mums will only return home once they are well enough and ready , and will continue to receive postnatal care from a community midwife for up to 28 days after giving birth			1

the average stay in hospital for a new mother after giving birth is 1.5 days
this compares to five days for women giving birth in @entity27 and @entity28
the short stays are being blamed on a shortage of midwives and beds
staff are concerned mothers are sent home before they have recovered from labour
