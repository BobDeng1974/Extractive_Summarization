it 's one of the biggest shows ever made and one of the biggest acquisitions for streaming service @entity4			1
but friends was nowhere to be found on the website today despite it 's long - advertised arrival telegraphed for january 1			0
the much - loved sitcom was uploaded to the site as promised , it 's just that no one could find it			2
that 's because it had been written into the @entity4 search engine as @entity18 - the way it is fashioned in the show 's opening credits - making it impossible to track down			2
where art thou ? : something of a @entity4 search engine stuff up meant viewers were not able to track down friends when all 10 seasons premiered on the streaming service on @entity32 the issue became quite a headache for those nursing @entity32 hangovers and wanted some light watching of their favorite show , @entity33 reported			1
some worked out they could search one of the actors that appear in the series , such as @entity45 , and friends would come up			0
@entity4 has acquired all 10 seasons of the show , allowing 236 to be instantly streamed on their website			1
so long as viewers can track it down			0
@entity4 has n't commented on the search stuff up			2
however the website seems to have reworked the configuration			0
friends is now able to be searched using normal spelling			0
mich - loved : all 10 seasons of @entity55 can now be streamed instantly on @entity4			1
