by @entity0 published : 16:37 est , 4 december 2013 @entity2 : 09:23 est , 5 december 2013 are @entity3 out of the title race ? honeymoon over			1
not that everything been going swimmingly for @entity6 since leaving @entity7 for @entity3			1
but things took a serious turn for worse after wednesday night 's encounter with the ex. vitriol and hatred poured down from the visiting fans to @entity6 's right after a late winner from @entity17 condemned @entity3 to their fourth defeat of the @entity20 campaign			1
how the @entity21 gloated as they rejoiced amid the billowing blue smoke of a flare with a full repertoire of songs			0
' are you watching @entity6 ? ' , ' you 're getting sacked in the morning ' and , a favourite all night : ' oh @entity6 is full of s * * * '			1

@entity89 turned towards them at the final whistle and offered his applause and @entity37 hoisted match - winner @entity17 up onto his shoulders			2
the symbolism was lost on no - one			0
in 11 years as @entity7 manager , @entity6 had never been able to secure a @entity20 win at @entity3 , @entity101 , @entity102 or @entity103			1
@entity89 did it at the first time of asking and @entity7 won at @entity32 for the first time in 21 years			1
' it was more than a football game , ' said the @entity7 boss after ending the hoodoo			2
as the visitors enjoyed their victory , @entity3 fans sped for the exits			1
they will wake today to the reality that the champions are languishing ninth in the @entity20 , a dozen points adrift of pacesetters @entity103			1
all of their closest rivals won on a busy night and to make matters worse , @entity64 collected his fifth yellow card of the season and will miss saturday 's game at home to @entity128			1
it might have been worse for @entity64			2
he was booked for a launching a shoulder into @entity73 's face			0
as ever , on a night of frustration , @entity3 's talisman flirted with trouble			1
@entity73 turned away holding his mouth and @entity89 , standing close by , reacted angrily , although he had calmed down by the time he spoke after the match and agreed a yellow card was the right decision			0
blow : @entity3 captain @entity54 appears dejected after seeing his side go down to @entity7 at @entity32 all smiles : @entity6 shares a joke with @entity89 ahead of the @entity20 clash at @entity32 former favourite : @entity57 , playing against his old club for the first time , battles for the ball with @entity49 up for the challenge : @entity3 ace @entity64 takes a shot at @entity71 's @entity7 goal @entity152 could offer no assurances that the mysterious groin injury which is keeping @entity155 out of action would be cured in time to face @entity128 , when he desperately needs a win to stay in touch at the top			1
chances are being missed and they look frail at the back and it will be no consolation that this defeat was a thrilling contest which could have been won before @entity17 struck in the 85th minute			2
@entity64 and @entity62 hit the woodwork and , although @entity3 can claim to have been the better team overall			1
@entity71 produced some wonderful saves but @entity7 were always dangerous on the break			2
@entity49 in particular , with his muscle and fluent movement , gave @entity54 a torrid night and set up @entity17 's goal			1
@entity173 may not have been impressed with some of the thing @entity49 has said since leaving @entity175 on loan but he can not help but enjoy his progress , again assisting in a win against one of the @entity102 's title rivals			0
calm down : @entity6 ( left ) argues with his @entity7 successor @entity89 on the touchline close encounter : @entity58 heads over @entity37 ( centre ) but can not find the net the same could be said of @entity75 , quietly effective as ever , filling the holes and knitting play together			1
@entity49 lashed shot wide with only a few minutes gone and @entity31 beat away a fierce shot which exploded from the right boot of @entity80			0
@entity3 gradually built some tempo			2
@entity71 saved from @entity64 and @entity60 and @entity32 roared its disapproval at a couple of first - half decisions by @entity92 , never a popular referee in these parts			1
@entity92 did get it right when @entity62 darted into the box and took a tumble and the appeal went up for a penalty			0
the referee played on and replays suggested it was a good call			0
@entity58 went close , glancing a header inches wide of the far post from @entity52 's cross and @entity64 went closer still when his low effort clipped @entity73 and @entity37 and thumped into the foot of a post with the goalkeeper frozen			2
@entity210 does it : @entity49 celebrates after his pass was put into the net by @entity17 for the winner that goal : @entity217 's graphical recreation of @entity218 ( no 8 ) scoring the decisive goal for @entity7 at @entity32 - powered by @entity220 no old pals ' act : former @entity7 midfielder @entity57 battles with his old team - mate @entity76 for half an hour before half - time , @entity3 forced @entity7 back and @entity57 grew in stature			1
@entity57 prowled the width of halfway , collecting scraps , leaning around with his giant frame , easing possession away from the would - be counter-attackers in blue shirts			0
yet he could not stop everything			0
@entity78 slipped away but his effort faded away from 20 yards and , on one of the rare occasions @entity57 allowed himself ahead of the ball , @entity52 's pass was loose and @entity7 broke dangerously			2
it was a warning of what would happen in a game so precariously balanced			0
low cross sparked a pinball routine before the interval			0
@entity64 missed his kick and then had a second chance when a ricochet spun his way from @entity17			1
again he failed to connect properly			0
just as @entity3 seemed to be smothering @entity71 's goal , the visitors would wriggle free and threaten on the break			1
@entity253 had only been on a few seconds when he found himself clean through but unable to beat @entity254			0
heading for defeat : @entity56 directs a header on goal during @entity3 's loss remembrance : the @entity3 players observe a minute 's applause marking the death of @entity264 babe @entity263 @entity71 's best save of the night , a reflex reaction to deny @entity56 's close range header from a corner			1
he could only paw it as far as @entity62 , who craned his neck and headed against the bar			0
if it had the look of another one of the those nights for @entity6 , it would get worse when @entity49 swung a low cross in from the right , where @entity17 pounced			1
it was a second in as many games for the @entity279 left back deputising for @entity280 , the defender wanted by former @entity7 boss @entity6 , who has already plundered @entity281 for his coaching staff and @entity57			1
little wonder they enjoyed ending the honeymoon			0
@entity285 gets a skipload of abuse @entity6 said that he expected a ' mixed â€™ reception from the travelling @entity290 , if by mixed he meant a colourful collection of abusive chants , then we suppose he was right			2
the tone of their scorn was , fundamentally , that their former boss is full of rubbish , or words to that effect			0
@entity64 was also flipped a few fiery fingers when he was taking his first corner beneath the blue contingent			2
@entity304 ? @entity280 was present on the @entity7 bench			2
currently sidelined with a broken toe , he isexpected to be out until january			0
the @entity307 left back was the subject of a failed approach @entity309 towards the end of the summer transfer window			0
there is talk of a renewed bid in the newyear			0
that being the case , his next outing could well be back here at @entity32 ... @entity320 and @entity321 @entity6 and @entity89 enjoyed a warm exchange before the game kicked off , but the pair could not have been further apart during the contest			1
the @entity326 and @entity327 kept to the extreme edges of their technical zones for the majority of the match and thus avoided any prospect of confrontation			0
there appears to be a genuine respect between the two @entity20 bosses			2
@entity338 remembered fondly @entity339 , too , was the best way to describe the pre-game applause for survivor of the @entity344 air disaster and 1968 @entity346 winner @entity263 , who died last week at the age of 81			0
both sets of supporters took to their feet to pay tribute to the former @entity3 centre half who appeared 688 times for the @entity355			0
that , however , was merely a momentary truce between the @entity3 and @entity7 supporters , albeit a most pleasant one .			1

@entity17 scored the winning goal in the 86th minute to stun @entity3
@entity7 's victory was their first at @entity32 since 1992
visiting fans booed @entity6 before the game
@entity3 are ninth in @entity20 and 12 points adrift of *leaders* @entity103
@entity371 @entity64 *suspended* for next game against @entity128
and @entity6 could be without injured @entity374 as well
