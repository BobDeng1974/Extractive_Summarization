very lucky , in fact			2
at this point last season , the heat on @entity3 was being turned up mercilessly , so why is his successor escaping ? think about it : @entity8 have exactly the same points ( 37 ) from the same number of games ( 21 ) ; they have scored one goal fewer in the @entity13 than the @entity15 ’s side had managed , even after spending more than £ 150million last summer			1
but it goes deeper than statistics			2
both the @entity8 fans and players believe in @entity0 thanks to his pedigree in the game @entity3 was preparing for a @entity22 semi-final against @entity24 and had the @entity25 last 16 on his horizon ; @entity27 has had no @entity28 and overseen one of the most embarrassing defeats in @entity8 history			1
yet the 4 - 0 drubbing they suffered at the hands of @entity35 in august was quickly forgotten and when @entity8 failed to have a shot on target against @entity39 last weekend , again there was no major inquest			2
watching how that contest unfolded , i could n’t help thinking back to a similar match under @entity3 , particularly when @entity27 put @entity44 up front and started playing long but took off the players who would provide the best crosses — @entity48 and @entity49			1
the game in question was against @entity52			2
@entity8 drew 2 - 2 and @entity3 argued afterwards that his side were unlucky because they had put in 81 crosses			1
no @entity8 fans had sympathy with him , nor did his players			1
@entity59 , for one , was openly critical about that approach in his book			2
that would n’t happen now and there is a reason — just as there is a reason why @entity27 is not having his performance — or the performances of his team — scrutinised to the level that @entity3 experienced 12 months ago			1
it comes down to one word : belief			2
@entity8 's players , including @entity75 , arrive at @entity77 station to get the train south to face @entity79 @entity27 and assistant @entity80 start the trip to @entity82 ahead of the clash at @entity84 @entity8 were thrashed 4 - 0 by @entity35 in the @entity22 - yet @entity27 escaped major inquest @entity27 looked shocked as his star - studded united team went down 4 - 0 to the @entity88 outfit @entity89 scored a last - minute equiliser for @entity52 at @entity91 last season after @entity8 dominated @entity3 had the weight of the world on his shoulders when @entity52 pulled off a draw at @entity91 @entity27 strode into @entity91 after leading @entity97 to third place in the @entity99 , exuding authority , certainty and , above all , with a c.v			1
that included league titles in @entity105 , @entity106 and his home country , not to mention a @entity25 trophy			2
do not underestimate what that is worth to players and supporters			2
i remember an incident not long after @entity115 had become sole manager of @entity117			0
it was january 1999 and we had been drawn against @entity8 in the @entity120 but had not won at @entity91 since 1990			0
@entity121 put us ahead early on and we were within minutes of seeing out the tie but were hit with two sucker punches in the last few minutes			0
the dressing room afterwards was like a morgue			0
the goals had left us feeling hollow but then we heard @entity115 speaking on television			0
@entity128 scores a late winner to beat @entity117 in the @entity120 in the treble - winning 1999 season @entity115 ( centre ) said he knew @entity117 would win at @entity91 one day following the defeat in 1999 ‘ you know what , ’ he said			1
‘ we have lost but , i guarantee , we will win here one day			0
’ suddenly you start thinking to yourself , ‘ he really believes this ’			0
@entity115 had been part of @entity139 ’s technical committee when they won the @entity99 six months earlier			0
his words , then , carried extra significance and they clearly worked			0
we lost only one of our next six trips , winning three			0
something similar happened with @entity146			2
before the @entity25 semi-final against @entity149 in 2005 , his message could not have been more emphatic			0
‘ we will win , ’ he told us			0
he arrived with two @entity154 titles and a @entity155 , so we did not doubt him			0
but it should not be forgotten that both @entity115 and @entity146 had some awful results in their first seasons — @entity115 was dumped out of @entity28 by @entity159 , @entity146 was beaten in the @entity120 by @entity160 — yet , like @entity27 , they were never subjected to an intense focus			1
@entity146 was convinced that @entity117 would beat @entity149 in the 2005 @entity25 semi-final @entity146 's belief was proved to be correct as @entity117 did win to progress into the @entity25 final there is an underlying problem for @entity168 managers there			1
i wrote last season how we needed @entity3 to succeed at @entity8 , for @entity172 to flourish with @entity117 and for @entity173 to do well with @entity174 to show that our coaches could compete at the top level			1
that is where the swagger @entity27 possesses comes from ; that is why he can speak as he did in a press conference and be so blunt about @entity182			1
what reaction would there have been to @entity3 saying one of the best strikers in the world has to prove himself ? i love watching @entity27 in front of the cameras every week ; i love how he can be so dismissive if he does n’t like a question and find his reactions very funny			1
@entity75 , @entity192 and @entity49 show their dejection after conceding to @entity39 @entity39 players celebrate their first win over @entity8 at @entity91 in 27 years @entity197 argues with @entity198 during @entity8 's defeat by @entity39 @entity27 is known as a winner and that helps him even when his side are under - performing just like sir @entity204 , there is meaning to every word he puts out each friday afternoon			1
people tipped @entity8 to win the title at the start of the season purely because of @entity27 and i ’m convinced that , had they beaten @entity39 , he would have started talking up their credentials , especially with @entity212 dropping points at @entity214			1
a victory would have left them nine points behind @entity149 but many players in the dressing room , along with countless supporters , would have believed him			2
why ? he is @entity27 and has the record to back it up , particularly in big games			1
@entity8 celebrate their last @entity13 victory - over @entity223 on @entity224 having a name for winning is priceless			0
things clearly are n’t working as well as @entity27 would want			1
as the injuries that @entity8 have suffered shows , there have been issues with regard to his training methods and his adapting to the @entity13			0
he has also been lucky that @entity117 and @entity234 , who disappeared over the horizon when @entity3 struggled , have not been more of a threat			1
this year , he has capitalised , beating both clubs , as well as drawing with @entity149			0
clearly he has had some fortune but not with his reputation			0
and that is why , no matter how underwhelming @entity8 have been , they will believe at @entity243 has them heading back to the @entity25			0
stones had a let - off but all bosses hate taking risks @entity247 got off lightly during @entity214 ’s @entity120 replay against @entity249 on tuesday			1
the young @entity174 defender took on three players on the edge of his own penalty area and nearly cost his side a goal			2
i expressed that view on @entity258 and the reaction i got was colourful , to say the least , but the main responses were that ‘ you would have hoofed it ! ’ , i was ‘ a typical @entity267 dinosaur ’ and , my favourite , that i was nothing but ‘ a yard dog ’			0
@entity247 was criticised by @entity268 on @entity258 for taking on three players on the edge of his box that last term never fails to bring a smile to my face			1
my @entity274 used it to refer to the old @entity277 defender @entity276 or @entity8 ’s @entity278 when i was a kid			0
those two did not mess around ! on a serious note , we have an idea that foreign coaches encourage this type of game , dribbling the ball out from the back			0
@entity289 bombed out @entity290 for taking chances at the back			0
@entity115 and @entity146 would have been furious if i , or anyone else , had tried that			0
@entity276 ( left ) and @entity278 ( right ) were two defenders who did not mess about it was the same with @entity174			0
@entity299 and @entity300 would not have stood for that			0
another thing all those coaches do is select a target man for their teams — whether it be @entity307 , @entity308 , @entity309 or @entity310			0
is n’t that typically @entity168 ? we all want technically gifted players , for them to be brave , to show and receive the ball			2
@entity247 does that really well but no manager in world football wants a defender who dribbles in his own box — whether they are from @entity320 or @entity321			1
this week i ’m looking forward to seeing if the old @entity323 is back ... the @entity325 derby again made for compelling viewing on thursday and the story of @entity323 scoring twice could not have been more romantic for @entity325 fans			1
is @entity329 the man to coax @entity323 back to the form he showed when he played for @entity117 ? certainly there were flashes of his best in the @entity335 , not least in the emphatic finish for @entity325 ’s opener			1
@entity323 scored twice for @entity325 against @entity338 in the @entity339 i started thinking about how he celebrated in front of the @entity338 supporters when we beat them 4 - 0 at @entity344 in the @entity25 back in 2009			1
@entity323 was at his peak then and it has been a sad football story to see how things have gone for him since			2
@entity323 celebrated in front of the @entity325 fans when he tormented them in a 4 - 0 win for @entity117 in 2009 now he is back at his first club , it could be that his career is going to finish on a high			1
there is a lot for @entity325 to play for this season — @entity154 , the @entity25 and the @entity339 — and if @entity329 can get @entity323 back to somewhere near his most clinical , they will have an excellent striker .			1

@entity0 's record is very similar to that of @entity3 last season
@entity27 is a winner and has the belief of the players and fans
@entity247 was let off after his risky run against @entity249
@entity323 showed *glimpses* of his best form in the @entity325 derby
