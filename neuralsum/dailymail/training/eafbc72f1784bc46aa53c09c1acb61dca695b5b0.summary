by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 wants to keep his playmakers firmly in the spotlight after they all shone brightly in a comfortable win over @entity6			1
the new @entity8 head coach is well known for advocating an attacking philosophy and it was his front players who stole the show on @entity14 's return to @entity15 as @entity8 romped to a 4 - 0 victory			1
@entity17 , the club - record signing whose early - season rejuvenation under @entity2 is clear for all to see , as well as @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 , proved far too strong for the back three deployed by @entity14			1
two - goal hero : @entity20 bagged a brace against @entity6 at @entity15 on saturday magician : @entity17 was in brilliant form for @entity8 against former manager @entity14 's side @entity20 scored twice in the first half , either side of a second goal in as many @entity31 appearances for @entity32 , while @entity22 added a fourth in the second half to take @entity8 top of the table			1
and @entity2 was full of praise for his wealth of attacking talent , insisting he always wants to let them play unshackled			2
' @entity17 , @entity22 , @entity41 and @entity21 create the movement and rotate - they are free , ' he said			1
' we work a lot on the training ground but it is important that the players are free in their minds because they are creative players			2
' you can not put the players like that in the shade , you need to provide the organisation but after that they are free			2
' it is true that @entity17 can improve a lot			2
he is still young and when a young player arrives in a different country it is hard to adapt			2
' we all know his skills and we are very pleased for him and for all of the squad - sunday was a very good day			1
' free role : @entity2 has said he wants to unleash the likes of @entity20 and @entity17 calming influence : @entity2 refuses to get carried away after seeing his team win their first two games despite being pleased with his first competitive home game in charge of @entity8 , @entity2 was quick to dispel any early season talk of a title tilt			1
' it is nothing , ' he replied when asked about @entity8 sitting top of the table			1
' it is two games			2
the most important thing is to try and develop our style and philosophy , we showed our basis			0
' for me , it is important that the team show they are a team			0
we played like a team all together and we can achieve something			0
' it is important to keep the reality and stay calm			0
if you lose two games you are in danger but we need to keep calm , it is only the beginning of the season			0
' @entity14 saw his side given something of a run around , especially in the first half as his back three of @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 were exposed			1
although he introduced @entity104 at half - time and reverted to four at the back , the 67 - year - old is keen to persevere with his new 3 - 5 - 2 system			1
defensive reshape : @entity14 was forced into reshuffling a back three which included @entity100 unfazed : @entity14 will not be changing his side 's formation despite the heavy defeat at @entity8 ' i do n't know if that ( the system ) is a problem , ' he said			1
' we played okay last week playing that way , it is about energy really			0
we were slower on the ball and were off the pace a bit - in certain areas we were n't sharp enough			1
we have to work harder both with and without the ball			0
' i do n't think it is about systems			0
that system allows me to get two strikers into the team which i was trying to do			0
' ( @entity129 ) @entity128 does n't play up on his own , it is difficult			0
@entity131 does n't play up on his own			0
you look to play 4 - 4 - 2 and you get slaughtered in midfield , it is not easy			1
' with @entity136 ruled out with a hamstring injury , @entity14 played @entity138 up with @entity128 and the @entity139 international was guilty of missing the best chance of the game for the visitors with the score at 1 - 0			1
@entity14 was jeered by the travelling @entity6 contingent in the latter stages for acknowledging @entity8 fans calling for him to wave at them			1
mutual respect : former @entity15 boss @entity14 acknowledged the @entity8 supporters but he brushed aside those complaints and insisted it made no difference where his side lost , just that certain issues need addressing			1
' it was a disappointing day obviously , we started poorly and did n't get out of it , ' he said			0
' we could 've been 1 - 0 down in 30 seconds , we looked like a team of strangers			2
we let them play , stood off them and did n't get close to them			0
' it is three points , that is all that matters to me , come here play well and pick up a positive result			0
getting beat here is no different to getting beat anywhere else			0
' i 'm sat there watching the game and there are punters up there singing " give us a wave "			0
i do n't know what punters they are - it is n't a big deal			2

@entity20 scored two goals in @entity8 's *emphatic* win at the @entity15
@entity6 's back three were unable to cope with the threat of @entity190
former @entity8 boss @entity14 will stick with 3 - 5 - 2 despite heavy loss
