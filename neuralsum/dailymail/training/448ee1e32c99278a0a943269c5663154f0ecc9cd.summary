by @entity0 published : 17:17 est , 18 june 2013 updated : 02:21 est , 19 june 2013 disgraced : sir @entity1 , chairman of the @entity2 at a charity clay pigeon shoot event near @entity4 , 2003 the bosses of failed banks should face jail or lose the right to claim bonuses for up to ten years for ' reckless misconduct ' , a report recommends today			1
the new criminal offence would make sure that top executives paid for their ' shocking and widespread malpractice ' , the @entity12 said			1
not a single @entity18 banker has been sent to prison since the financial crash began in 2007 , but the proposed legislation would make sure they would be ' on the hook ' in future , it added			1
as well as prison terms , errant bankers would face heavy fines and bans from the financial services industry , as well as curbs on bonuses and the threat of pensions being cancelled			1
@entity12 chairman @entity34 mp said : ' under our recommendations , senior bankers who seriously damage their banks or put taxpayers ' money at risk can expect to be fined , banned from the industry , or , in the worst cases , go to jail			1
that has not been the case up to now			1
' this deals with some of the senior people who many feel got off lightly last time and for whose mistakes we are still paying			1
' in its 527 - page report , the commission found that ' deep lapses in standards have been commonplace '			1
' it is not just bankers that need to change			1
the actions of regulators and governments have contributed to the decline in standards , ' said @entity65 mp mr @entity34			2
the commission of mps and peers calls for a sweeping overhaul of top pay , with @entity72 regulators given new powers to cancel pension rights and payoffs for the bosses of bailed - out banks			2
it also wants watchdogs to be able to force banks to defer bonus payments for up to a decade , in order to prevent bosses reaping large rewards for risky , short - term strategies that subsequently lead to losses			2
' the rewards for fleeting , often illusory success have been huge , while the penalties for failure have been much smaller , or non-existent , ' mr @entity34 said			2
however , @entity91 , director general of the @entity92 , said : ' there are tough criminal sanctions in the @entity18 for those who engage in fraudulent behaviour			1
enforcing those must come before the introduction of new sanctions			2
' the findings of the commission , set up last summer in the wake of the libor scandal , are not binding , but the government is being urged to implement its recommendations ' in full '			2
the proposals will now be handed to ministers			2
the reforms will aim to prevent a repeat of the bailouts and scandals such as libor rate - rigging , where bosses have walked away with large payoffs and pensions			0
but bankers will not be targeted retrospectively			1
@entity1 , who left @entity117 in ruins but is still receiving a pension of £ 342,000 a year for life , will be unaffected			0
nor will any legislation ensnare former @entity123 boss @entity122 , who will collect £ 406,000 of his £ 580,000 - a - year retirement deal			0
under current rules , senior bankers have been able to evade punishment by claiming they were not personally responsible for collapses and that they had not committed deliberate fraud , with the onus on financial authorities to prove wrongdoing			1
but in the new proposed regime , top managers would be held individually accountable and would have to show they took ' all reasonable steps ' to avoid a failure			0
' a lack of personal responsibility has been commonplace throughout the industry , ' mr @entity34 added			0
' senior figures have continued to shelter behind an accountability firewall			0
' the commission also wants a new licensing system to stop traders involved in setting @entity147 rates and prevent area managers who oversee the sale of financial products from slipping through the net			1
they will have to abide by a new set of conduct rules or lose their licence			0
the report also recommends that @entity72 watchdogs should be able to force badly - behaved banks to sign a formal agreement to improve their culture and standards			0
the commission – whose members include the archbishop of canterbury @entity166 and former chancellor @entity168 – also demands the dismantling of @entity170 ( @entity170 ) , the body that is supposed to manage taxpayers ' holdings in @entity117 and @entity174 at arms ' length from ministers			0
it said the government , which denies forcing the resignation of @entity117 boss @entity181 , has interfered in the running of the two banks and that @entity170 is seen as a ' fig leaf ' for ' the reality of direct government control '			0
ministers must also make an immediate commitment to analyse whether @entity117 should be split up into a ' good bank ' , that could lend more to small firms and personal customers , and a ' bad bank ' to dump its toxic assets , the commission said			0
a study of high street lenders by competition watchdogs and an independent panel of experts to look at measures to help bank customers were also part of the recommendations			0
@entity204 , a former @entity205 spokesman , said : ' why are there no banged - up bankers ? that is what most people want to know after the last five years of scandals and shame and moral and financial bankruptcy			1
' he added : ' we must stop the subterfuge of @entity170 and put the @entity205 on the spot to make the banks we own lend			0
' @entity117 , our biggest business bank , has failed the nation that rescued it at £ 1,500 for every taxpayer			0
it must be broken up with new management and tough net lending targets for the good bank so small business can grow again			0

new criminal offence to tackle ' shocking and widespread malpractice '
no @entity18 bankers jailed since financial crash began in 2007
