by @entity0 published : 06:41 est , 2 february 2013 updated : 11:54 est , 4 february 2013 a van driver was handed a £ 200 fine for not displaying a no smoking sticker on his new vehicle four times more than if he 'd been caught actually puffing at the wheel			1
@entity7 , 28 , from @entity8 had just picked up the brand new van from a garage when he was pulled over in a joint police and council operation to clamp down on ' dodgy vehicles			1
mr @entity7 , who does not smoke , was warned that lighting up in company vehicles was illegal and that he would have been fined £ 50 if he had been caught taking a drag behind the wheel			1
fuming : @entity19 boss @entity18 with the £ 200 fine handed to one of his drivers for not displaying a no smoking sign on a brand new vehicle clipboard - wielding council officers then , however , spotted that he did n't had a ' no smoking ' sticker on his gleaming van and he was given an on - the - spot fine of £ 200			1
mr @entity7 tried to explain that he had only just picked the new van up from a workshop where workers had painted the @entity8 logo on the side and that he was driving it back to the firm 's hq in @entity34			1
the law states that any ' company vehicle ' must have a no smoking sign - meaning that if he had been in the van with no logo he would n't have been fined as it would have been considered a ' personal van '			2
yesterday mr @entity7 's boss @entity18 said he was ' fuming ' at the fine			2
he said : ' let this be a warning to anybody that drives a company van ... we have just been fined £ 200 for not displaying a no smoking sign in one of our vans			2
offence : mr @entity7 had failed to display a no - smoking sign in the brand new van ' all our vans normally have them , but this was a new van we have only just had sign written , and was driven by somebody who does n't smoke - but try explaining that to @entity58 ! ' the irony is that if our technician had been smoking he would have been fined four time less , just £ 50			1
' there was no warning or caution - it is absolutely ridiculous and at a time when small business like ours are having a tough time financially			0
' the operation - run by @entity58 , police and bailiffs - was called ' @entity72 ' and was aimed at cracking down on ' unlicensed waste carriers ' - fly - tippers - and other vehicles guilty of ' environmental crime '			0
bosses at @entity58 said that 95 vehicles were stopped outside the @entity78 in @entity79 last friday			0
among those stopped included six people driving vehicles in such a bad state they were seized by police , one man arrested for possessing drugs , one for stealing a disabled badge and several fly - tippers			0
they also doled out 12 £ 200 fines for not displaying ' no smoking signs ' in company vehicles and two £ 50 fines to people caught smoking inside company vans			0
cllr @entity96 , cabinet member for the environment at @entity58 , said : ' we will continue to work closely with our partners in the police and the courts to tackle illegal activity around vehicles , especially looking out for unlicensed waste carriers that are responsible for so much dumping in our borough			0
' we will continue to protect those workers who are forced to sit in smoke polluted environments because their employers do n't comply with the law which bans smoke in company vehicles			0
