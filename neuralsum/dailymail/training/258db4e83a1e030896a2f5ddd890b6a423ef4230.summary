@entity0 calls his future wife @entity2 ' dearest heart ' and daydreams about their future together letters go on display this friday at @entity8 museum to celebrate 100th birthday of @entity0 's wife by @entity11 published : 06:54 est , 12 march 2012 updated : 14:09 est , 12 march 2012 @entity0 is remembered for many things – but very rarely for being a softy			1
however a series of love letters penned to his future wife long before his rise to power and fall from grace , reveal that at one time he was just another man in love			1
decades before he became known to some as ‘ @entity0 ’ , it was @entity0 making up the nicknames – sweet ones to his future bride in gushy love notes that reveal a surprisingly soft and romantic side of the man taken down by @entity30			1
young love : then attorney @entity0 and his bride pose with their newly acquired marriage license in in front of a fireplace at the @entity37			1
they wed in the inn 's wedding chapel on june 12 , 1940 love token : this delicately written letter from @entity43 to her husband is part of the display ‘ @entity56 heart ’ , he addresses her , while recalling their first meeting in flowery prose and daydreaming about their future together			1
during their two - year courtship @entity0 and his wife @entity2 exchanged dozens of letters , six of which will be unveiled friday at the @entity63 , @entity8 , as part of an exhibit celebrating the 100th birthday of the woman @entity0 playfully called his ‘ @entity69 gypsy			1
’ ‘ every day and every night i want to see you and be with you			0
yet i have no feeling of selfish ownership or jealousy , ’ @entity0 writes in one undated letter			1
‘ @entity75 for a long ride sunday ; let 's go to the mountains weekends ; let 's read books in front of fires ; most of all , let 's really grow together and find the happiness we know is ours			2
’ eighteen years after his death , the correspondence offers a tiny window into a fiercely private side of @entity0 that almost no one ever saw			1
‘ these letters are fabulous , ’ said supervisory museum curator @entity91			2
‘ it 's a totally different person from the @entity30 tapes that people know			2
president @entity0 started out as an idealistic young man ready to conquer the world and with @entity43 he knew he could do it			2
there 's a lot of hope , there 's a lot of tenderness and it 's very poetic			2
@entity105 : @entity0 and his wife @entity43 pose for photos while campaigning at the @entity108 in @entity109 in 1960 tender : the highly personal letters reveal a totally different side to @entity0 @entity0 was secretly seeing a psychiatrist during the height of his political career , a new book has claimed			1
the former @entity118 president began seeing dr @entity119 in 1952 with a string of complaints he thought were all in his mind , like back and neck pain and insomnia			0
‘ @entity129 ’ claims that @entity0 continued seeing the doctor for at least a decade including during the fateful 1960 election which he lost to @entity128			2
should the disclosures have been made public at the time , it is questionable whether voters would have allowed such an unstable man to become president			0
author @entity136 also reveals that in a foreshadowing of @entity138 once hired a private eye to look into @entity128 ’s health			0
according to the book , in 1960 @entity0 ’s team got into offices belonging to two doctors treating @entity128 looking for dirt that he was actually secretly ill. when @entity128 found this out his father bizarrely asked his friend @entity148 to find the best investigator around so they could do their own digging			2
‘ he loved her , he was absolutely enthralled by her and that 's all he thought about			0
’ the letters stand in stark contrast to the grim - faced leader forced to resign in 1974 , disgraced			0
instead , @entity0 comes across as an ardent and persistent suitor in the letters , which date from 1938 to just before the couple 's marriage in june 1940			1
the two met while auditioning for ‘ @entity162 ’ in the @entity8 town of @entity164 and dated for two years until @entity0 proposed on the south @entity166 cliffs overlooking the @entity167			1
he later delivered her engagement ring in a small basket overflowing with mayflowers			0
the romantic touch and chivalry that @entity0 brought to his seaside proposal comes through in the letters as well			1
in two of the handwritten notes , @entity0 — raised a @entity177 — uses ‘ thee ’ instead of ‘ you ’ to refer to his future bride , a pronoun that signals a special closeness in the @entity177 tradition			1
he also writes about himself in the third person , referring to himself as a ‘ prosaic person ’ whose heart was nonetheless ‘ filled with that grand poetic music ’ upon knowing her			0
‘ somehow on tuesday there was something electric in the usually almost stifling air in @entity164			0
an @entity69 gypsy who radiates all that is happy and beautiful was there , ’ he wrote in one letter			0
‘ she left behind her a note addressed to a struggling barrister who looks from a window and dreams			0
and in that note he found sunshine and flowers , and a great spirit which only great ladies can inspire			0
someday let me see you again ? in september ? maybe ? ’ a much more practical - and somewhat less impulsive — @entity43 replies in one short note : ‘ in case i do n't see you before why do n't you come early wednesday - and i 'll see if i can burn a hamburger for you			0
’ the object of @entity0 's affection was slower to come around , but eventually was just as smitten with @entity0 as he was with her , said @entity217 , @entity0 's youngest brother			1
exhibition : six love letters go on display on friday at the @entity221 ‘ she was quite an independent young lady and she was very cautious about anyone she met and if they could n't smile , she would n't want to do too much unless she could make them smile			1
that captured @entity0 's imagination , ’ the younger @entity0 said			1
she challenged me and i think she challenged @entity0			2
’ @entity0 's presidency began to unravel in 1972 when burglars who were later tied to his re-election committee broke into the @entity233 headquarters to get dirt on his political adversaries			1
@entity0 denied knowing about plans for the break - in beforehand , but an 18 1/2 minute gap in a recording of a @entity242 @entity241 meeting led many to suspect a cover - up			2
secret shrink : a new book details the presidential campaign of @entity0 against @entity128 and how @entity0 was secretly seeing a psychiatrist faced with impeachment and a possible criminal indictment , @entity0 resigned on aug. 9 , 1974 and retreated to his native @entity8			1
the following month he was granted a pardon by president @entity251			0
@entity43 never doubted her husband and stood by him until she died in 1993 , a day after their 53rd wedding anniversary , said @entity256 , a consultant to the @entity258 , which is co-sponsoring the exhibit , and a former aide to @entity0 after he left the @entity241			2
her loyalty and spirit was a testament to their love and part of what bound them together from the earliest days of their courtship in @entity164 , when he was a young attorney and she a high school stenography teacher fresh out of college			0
‘ she was with him the whole way ; she never lost faith in him			0
her feeling was that it was the country 's loss when he had to resign , that he had accomplished so much good and had so much more good to accomplish , ’ mr @entity256 said			0
‘ her favourite saying was , ' @entity281 and upward			0
' she spent no time looking back			0
she was always looking forward			0
’ revelations : @entity284 journalist @entity283 ( left ) interviewed @entity0 in a series in 1977 that ended in one of 20th century television 's most dramatic confessions			1
