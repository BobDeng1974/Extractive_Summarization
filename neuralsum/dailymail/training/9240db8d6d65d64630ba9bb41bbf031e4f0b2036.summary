by @entity1 reporter published : 01:14 est , 30 july 2013 updated : 02:52 est , 30 july 2013 @entity2 now says his infamous ’ 47 percent ’ comments that helped doom his 2012 presidential campaign bid were taken completely out of context			1
‘ actually , i did n’t say that , ’ the former @entity7 nominee said in a recent interview in which he said the comments at a @entity11 fundraiser were came to be ‘ perceived as being something very different ’ than how they were intended			1
this is a pivot for @entity2 , who has previously said at different points that the statements were ‘ not elegantly stated ’ and ‘ completely wrong			0
’ misinterpreted ? @entity2 admits his 2012 presidential bid was heavily damaged by his ' 47 percent ' remarks at a meeting with donors in @entity11 but now characterizes them as taken out of context the presidential also - ran and one - time governor of @entity25 voiced his new stance on the issue during a long sit down with the @entity28 published saturday			1
the controversial comments were made during a closed - door meeting with donors in @entity11 in the september before last year ’s presidential elections			0
when a donor asked @entity2 how he intended to beat @entity33 , he responded : ‘ there are 47 percent who are with [ @entity33 ] , who are dependent upon government , who believe that they are victims , who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them , who believe that they are entitled to health care , to food , to housing , to you - name - it			0
’ get outta here : ' actually , i did n't say that ' was @entity2 's recently published response to questions about his taped comments that ' 47 percent of people ... who are dependent on government , who believe they are victims ' would be voting for @entity33 these were the voters , @entity2 said at the time , who would be voting for @entity33 no matter what			2
the remarks seemed damning to many at the time and were widely taken as an insult to the poor			2
though @entity2 is on video making them , he now says they were misinterpreted			0
‘ but when you said there are 47 percent who wo n’t take personal responsibility … ’ began @entity28 interviewer @entity70 , before @entity2 interrupted			1
' that was n't what was meant by it			2
that is the way it was perceived ' : @entity2 says the 47 percent comments were not meant as a jab at the poor ‘ that 's how it began to be perceived , ’ @entity2 said			1
‘ and so i had to ultimately respond to the perception , because perception is reality			0
’ regardless of whether @entity2 is to be believed , most would agree on another way he characterized them			0
‘ well , clearly that was a very damaging quote and hurt my campaign effort , ’ he said .			1

in a @entity28 interview , the former @entity7 candidate acknowledged the quote was ' very damaging ' to his campaign but was n't the attack on the poor that many perceived it to be
