by @entity0 criticism : @entity2 claimed darker shades of make - up disappear more quickly @entity2 has accused boots of creating a racial divide through the ‘ ghettoisation ’ of make - up			1
the @entity10 film star , 41 , said the high street chain initially stocks dark shades of foundation when a make - up range is launched , but then takes them off shelves much earlier than pale shades – forcing women with darker skin to shop in specialist stores			1
speaking at a @entity23 event on tuesday , miss @entity2 , who is also the face of @entity21 , said : ‘ if the make - up was in there longer , the girls would go and get it and then the stores would get more , and they ’d realise that everybody wants it , and then they would stock it			1
‘ there ’s this ghettoisation of make - up right now			1
the right shade is there for everybody but you can only get it at specialised shops			0
' so you do n’t go to @entity5			0
so as a result we are all being physically separated when we go and buy make - up			1
' she added : ‘ we ’re starting to think they do n’t want us there			0
and it ’s not that , it ’s just that six - month time lapse where the shops are waiting to be able to say it ’s not selling so let ’s stop stocking it			0
we ’ve got to encourage them			0
’ she added : ‘ i ’ll go into boots at @entity55 if i ’ve forgotten my make - up bag or something and there is n’t even a picture of a black woman			2

make - up artist @entity82 said : ' it all comes down to men in suits deciding what sells ' ( file photo ) miss @entity2 also recalled going to castings where she and @entity90 actress @entity89 were the only two auditioning for a role , because of the lack of black stars in @entity94			2
responding to the claims , make - up artist @entity82 said : ‘ every single make - up company has every single shade			2
but it all comes down to territories and men in suits deciding what sells			0
