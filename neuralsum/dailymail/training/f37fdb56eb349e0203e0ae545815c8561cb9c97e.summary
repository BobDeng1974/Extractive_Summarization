by @entity0 published : 12:51 est , 27 september 2013 updated : 18:19 est , 27 september 2013 president @entity1 has issued a stern warning to @entity3 saying that the ' extremists ' who were threatening to shut down the government need to stop politicizing the ' full faith and credit of the @entity8 ' as it could rock the global economy			2
the president held a press conference friday afternoon , hours after the @entity11 approved the temporary budget measure that would allow the government to remain funded so that 800,000 federal workers would not be furloughed come tuesday			1
he called for them to fulfill their two main responsibilities : ' pass a budget on time and pay our bills on time '			0
' unlike the last time they threatened this course of action , this debate is n't really about our deficits ... instead the @entity28 @entity27 are so concerned about appeasing the @entity29 , ' he said at a press conference friday afternoon			2
laying down the law : president @entity1 called for the group of ' extremists ' on @entity34 who were holding up the vote to ' knock it off ' and raise the budget before dramatically endangering the global economy not negotiating : @entity1 said that he will not bargain and trade in order to get the country 's bills paid not messing around : @entity1 has not spoken with @entity41 all week ' this grandstanding has real effects on real people , ' he said , citing how military personnel who are serving overseas will have their pay delayed and their families will be forced to do without			0
the other issue that the president focused on in his speech was the fact that following the passage of a budget , the next battle will be over raising the debt ceiling , which he described as the decision to ' pay the bills that have already been racked up '			0
' nobody gets to threaten the full faith and credit of the @entity8 just for political reasons			0
' the @entity8 people have worked too hard to recover from a bunch of crises ... to see extremists in @entity3 cause another crisis			0
' the @entity11 has done their part to allow temporary funding of the government by passing the bill that will avoid a shutdown , but it now needs to be approved by the @entity28 in order to be signed into law			1
the solution may not be reached until after the weekend - just hours before the deadline to avoid the shutdown - because @entity27 lawmakers are worried that a fraction of their members may vote against the budget bill if it is brought to a vote today			1
their problem lies with the fact that the @entity85 majority in the @entity11 stripped the bill of the provision that would defund president @entity1 's health care plan			1
bring it on : senator @entity90 was one of 19 republicans who voted against the temporary budget bill that would keep the government open and avoid a federal shut down on tuesday get in line : senior @entity27 leaders - including @entity11 minority leader @entity97 - rejected the move to tie @entity100 funding to the funding of the government a group of conservatives including senators @entity105 and @entity90 , who gained national attention for staging a 21 - hour filibuster to make a point about how ' @entity100 ' should not be funded ' , wanted the budget to both fund the government and defund the @entity100			1
in spite of @entity90 's efforts , there was never a viable chance that those plans would be approved in the @entity11 because of the heavy @entity85 presence			2
on friday the @entity11 overwhelmingly rejected the ' @entity100 ' provision - by 79 to 19			0
some of the most senior republicans in the @entity11 - including minority leader @entity97 , @entity121 , and @entity122 - voted to pass the cloture motion which would pass a continuing resolution that would keep the government fully funded until november 15			0
' today , the @entity27 has been infected by a small and destructive faction , ' senate majority leader @entity126 said			0
the overall budget bill was passed by the @entity11 but with a much smaller margin , as the final approval came with a vote of 54 for the bill and 44 against			1
now , before the temporary funding goes into effect , the @entity28 needs to approve of the temporary funding			0
looming : senate majority leader @entity126 looks at a countdown clock as he warned that the @entity27 - controlled @entity28 must pass the budget bill or face being blamed for furloughing 800,000 federal workers the @entity27 - controlled @entity28 could cause problems , however , because there is a group of rebellious representatives who are willing to vote against the budget - and in turn , shut down the government - because they think it is insufficient in cutting down on spending			1
if the bill is not passed , 800,000 federal workers will be put on unpaid leave on tuesday			2
on a wider scale , @entity8 standing in the world economy will be threatened as it was when the country 's credit rating was downgraded following the 2011 budget debate			0
leaders of the @entity27 are among the most concerned about a shutdown as the actions of the riskier , more conservative members could spell doom for the party on the whole			1
if a shut down does occur because the @entity28 does n't pass the bill , @entity27 leaders fear that it will be blamed on their party			1
@entity90 's filibuster helped him raise both his public profile and campaign funds , but it did not win him a loyal army of @entity27 friends in the @entity28 who feel that they are being set up to look like they are against the conservative cause if they vote to keep the government funded			1
' i think that a government shutdown is counterproductive to our message in 2014 , because we transfer the public 's attention perhaps away from @entity100 and instead put it on the pain that will be inflicted , that is still to be determined , on the effects of a government shutdown , ' @entity27 congressman @entity174 said .			2

the @entity11 had to vote on a temporary measure to keep the federal government funded but a group of conservative @entity27 attached a *clause* defunding ' @entity100 '
the @entity85 majority in the @entity11 stripped the health care funding issue from the bill and passed the budget measure today
now the budget bill has to be approved by the @entity28 in order to stave off a federal shut down on tuesday
@entity27 leaders want to wait to hold the vote because there are concerns that conservative members may try to stop it from passing in order to make a point about the @entity100
if the @entity28 votes against the bill , there will be little time for the bill to get passed before funding runs out and 800,000 workers are furloughed
