click here to read @entity2 's match report from @entity3 when you do n’t give the fans what they want , they turn their backs on the team and walk away			1
this , we can safely say , was an official protest			0
@entity14 are perilously close to @entity15 at international level and it will take more than a 1 - 0 win over @entity18 to drag them clear of danger			1
good on the 40,000 who trekked to the national stadium to watch a team minus the old favourites — @entity53 and @entity54 — for the first time since that humiliating @entity37 exit			2
those lucky fans with £ 30 tickets arrived in plenty of time because the underground trains at @entity62 were empty and the roads that are usually a pig to navigate around @entity3 were clear			1
for a tenner you could park closer to the stadium than @entity14 ’s head coach @entity21			1
inside , the atmosphere was eerie and uncertain , a throwback to the empty stands at the old stadium when things got really bad under dear old sir @entity73 in the late @entity74			0
attendances of 20,000 to 30,000 were not uncommon at the @entity76 back then as the @entity77 tried to drum up support for @entity80 and @entity81 tournaments			0
this was a new low , with just over 40,000 turning out to watch the team for the first time since they were booted out of @entity29 before 12 teams had even played their second group game			0
@entity88 , @entity14 ’s new captain , pointed out that this would still be the second highest attendance in @entity91 behind world champions @entity93			1
they lost 4 - 2 against @entity95 in @entity96 , so maybe there is hope after all			0
spot on : @entity88 scored the only goal of the game with a second - half penalty @entity102 looks to spearhead @entity14 revival @entity104 of a new era : @entity88 started his first game after being handed the @entity14 captaincy too little too late ? @entity88 is congratulated by teammates after scoring what was the winner the last recognisable protest by @entity14 supporters was after the penalty shootout defeat against @entity113 in the 2006 @entity37 quarter - final in @entity115			1
a few weeks later , in @entity117 ’s first game in charge of the national team , 45,864 were at @entity120 to watch @entity14 play @entity121			1
our splendid new national stadium was still being built			0
under the arch on wednesday night , they watched the team limp over the line with a 1 - 0 victory over the world ’s 53rd best team , thanks to @entity88 ’s emphatic finish from the penalty spot			1
to regain the trust of the nation , the team will need to gather momentum in a tour of the continent that takes us to @entity141 ( on monday ) , followed by @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 in the @entity147 qualifiers			0
it is n’t anything to get worked up about			0
no cigar : @entity151 came closest to breaking the first - half deadlock with a delicate chipped effort going to ground : @entity156 playmaker @entity155 ( @entity157 ) could have been awarded a first - half penalty talking tactics : @entity21 speaks to his players during a water break at @entity3 credit to those present on wednesday night because it would have been very easy to voice disapproval when @entity14 trooped off at half - time with the score 0 - 0			1
they were playing against a team who could barely string two passes together and yet we were reminded , as usual , just what a threat @entity18 were on the break			2
the atmosphere here was uncomfortable			0
everyone wants to see an @entity14 team emboldened by the words of @entity21 but — just like the stadium — they are increasingly empty			2
they want to believe , we all do , that @entity14 can come again at international level and go deep into @entity186 and @entity187			2
next generation : @entity189 ( @entity157 ) was part of a youthful @entity14 side selected by @entity21 @entity192 : @entity193 has an effort on goal during another lacklustre performance from @entity14 the sensible things to do would be to engage with inner - city kids and pay for busloads from deprived areas to come and watch @entity14 at @entity3			1
instead , the @entity77 will bombard us with advertising puff ahead of the next international occasion , when @entity144 arrive for a none - too - mouthwatering @entity147 qualifier on october 10			2
