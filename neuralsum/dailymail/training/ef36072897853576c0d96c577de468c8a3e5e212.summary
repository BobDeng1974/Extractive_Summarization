@entity5 , having taken the hallowed @entity1 heavyweight belt back to @entity2 on @entity4 ’s 73rd birthday , is ready to give @entity6 a shot at the world title			1
the big man from @entity10 is even willing to bring that gift to @entity12			0
be careful how you unwrap it , @entity6			2
@entity5 is the most dangerous @entity2 heavyweight since @entity6 and is being hailed as the giant most likely to end the @entity18 domination of the ring ’s marquee division			1
@entity5 saw off @entity21 to be crowned @entity1 heavyweight champion on saturday @entity5 was untroubled for large parts of the fight but when he was caught , showed he could take a punch @entity5 runs to the ropes to celebrate after the final bell ( left ) and shows off his new @entity1 heavyweight belt after massively outpointing the first @entity30 - born heavyweight champ , @entity21 , in @entity31 on saturday night , @entity5 said : ‘ i want @entity6 next , then @entity18 for all the other titles by the end of this year			1
' me and @entity6 would be one helluva fight			0
we ’re both big punchers and entertainers			0
' i would love to do it in the @entity39 , where i ’ve always enjoyed my visits			0
’ those trips to @entity39 are reported to have included the occasional flattening of @entity44 in sparring			0
@entity5 had also knocked out all 32 of his opponents prior to this weekend inside four rounds			0
but it is the composed , complete style of his 12 - round outclassing of @entity49 which heralds the prospect of a genuine all - american hero			0
@entity5 worked so effectively behind a ramrod jab , with such mobility and such variety of follow - up punching , that he represents a real threat to @entity18 who , like the new champion , stands just two inches shorter than @entity6 at 6ft 7in			1
@entity6 ( right ) - who @entity5 wants to fight next - easily beat @entity59 in a world title bout in november @entity18 's last bout ended with a fifth - round knockout win over @entity63 in november 2014 @entity6 became the @entity65 mandatory challenger to multiple alphabelt champion @entity18 when he stopped @entity59 late last year			1
but the younger of the two brothers is in negotiations to face another @entity2 , @entity68 , in @entity69 this april			2
there is also talk of @entity18 switching to @entity5 for that date , perhaps in the hope of catching him before he benefits from more experience of the big time			1
if @entity5 goes on to prove himself the first @entity76 since @entity76 , this @entity75 could be the saviour of heavyweight boxing			2
@entity83 this spring , the winner against @entity18 in late summer , the loser versus @entity81 in the autumn — now there ’s a schedule to reinvigorate the hardest old game			0
meanwhile , @entity5 ’s 33rd straight win will surely have brought a smile to @entity4 ’s face if he was well enough to tune in upon his return home from hospital			1
it has also put paid to @entity96 ’s amusing but nonsensical notion of dragging @entity6 out of retirement to fight @entity21			1
all in all , a good saturday night ’s work .			2

@entity5 is *eyeing* more success after his points win over @entity21 on saturday night at the @entity102
the *29* - year - old became the first @entity2 in nine years to win a heavyweight world title
next up @entity5 wants to face @entity6 - who *remains* *unbeaten* in his professional career thus far
after that he hopes to face @entity18 by the end of the year
