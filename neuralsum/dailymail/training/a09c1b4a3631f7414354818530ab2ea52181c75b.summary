they mostly occur because of erosion or underground water that gathers naturally or due to man - made activities			2
when this water dissolves the foundation beneath the surface layer , spaces and caverns develop underground			0
@entity112 , carbonate rock , and salt beds are particular vulnerable to this erosion			0
meanwhile , the top layer of @entity115 usually stays intact			0
when the dissolving area beneath the surface becomes too large , the surface suddenly gives way			0
