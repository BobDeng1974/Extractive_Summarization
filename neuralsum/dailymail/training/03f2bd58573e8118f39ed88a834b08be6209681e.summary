@entity0 has revealed the full extent of its ' right to be forgotten ' operation , disclosing that it has removed over 260,000 links from search results			1
the @entity5 ruled in may that @entity0 must remove links to websites that include content that is ' inadequate , irrelevant or no longer relevant '			1
however , the ruling has been criticised by culture secretary @entity10 , who said that criminals were using it to hide their murky pasts			1
the search giant admitted this week that so far there had been 216,810 requests for web links to be removed			1
this resulted in 783,510 links being reviewed and 262,280 hidden from internet users			2
ruling : the @entity5 ’s ' right to be forgotten ' ruling allows @entity23 citizens to request that links to ' inadequate , irrelevant or no longer relevant ' information be removed from @entity0 search results notice : @entity28 has received a number of notifications requesting removal of links			1
the request includes a note to say ' in many cases , the affected queries do not relate to the name of any person mentioned ' so far @entity0 's service is restricted to its @entity23 versions , although @entity42 data protection watchdogs want to make it global as the deleted results could be seen if a user was to switch to the			2
examples of links deleted by @entity0 include a number of @entity28 articles detailing issues ranging from drug abuse to incest , murder and spying			1
for instance , @entity28 received a request to remove a may 2009 article describing the sordid captivity in which @entity60 kept his family			1
the piece was based on extracts from the book ‘ @entity66 ’			1
publisher @entity67 told @entity28 at the time it did not know who sent the request other @entity28 stories removed from @entity0 results include claims from april 2013 that a ten - year - old girl could have died if her parents had relied on the @entity78 helpline			1
more recently , @entity0 removed a @entity28 story about a teenager , @entity80 , slapped with an asbo for committing 40 per cent of the offences in his town			1
the @entity84 , @entity85 17 includes the ‘ right to be forgotten and to erasure ’			0
under @entity85 17 , people who are mentioned in the data have the right to ‘ obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data relating to them and the abstention from further dissemination of such data			0
' this relates to data about the person when they were a child , when the data is no longer relevant or necessary for the purpose it was collected , the person who owns the content withdraws their consent , the storage period has expired , or if it was gathered illegally			0
the @entity42 defines ‘ data controllers ’ as ‘ people or bodies that collect and manage personal data ’			0
the @entity111 means any data controller who has been asked to remove data must ‘ take all reasonable steps , including technical measures ' to remove it			0
if a data controller does not take these steps they can be heavily fined			0
the content itself has not been deleted from @entity28 , but @entity0 will not list it in search results			1
instead , users searching for the topic on google.co.uk will see a message that says : ‘ some results may have been removed under data protection law in @entity23 ’ at the bottom of the page			0
@entity28 is yet to receive any requests from @entity132 or @entity133			0
in november , culture secretary @entity10 warned that terrorists were trying to use the ruling to wipe stories about their trials from @entity0 , condemning ' @entity139 's unelected judges ' for forcing search engines to remove links to news stories			1
in his speech to newspaper editors , mr @entity10 said : ‘ since @entity139 ’s unelected judges created the so - called “ right to be forgotten ” , @entity0 has been receiving a demand for deletion every 90 seconds , ’ he told the @entity149 conference in @entity150			1
‘ each day , a thousand requests pour in from people who , for one reason or another , would prefer their pasts to be kept secret			0
‘ criminals are having their convictions airbrushed from history even if they have since committed other , similar crimes			0
‘ terrorists have ordered @entity0 to cover up stories about their trials			2
’ mr @entity10 added : ‘ the “ right to be forgotten ” is censorship by the back door			2
stories are not being deleted from archives because of the ruling , but if they can not be found by the search engines they may as well not be there at all			2
’ the @entity5 ruled people had a right to ask for ‘ inadequate , irrelevant or no longer relevant , or excessive ’ information about them to be dropped from internet searches			1
the decision – which can not be appealed against and is binding for all @entity42 states – affects only search results and not lawfully published and true information			0
but once search engines like @entity0 drop links to such material , it becomes almost impossible to find on the internet			2
@entity185 was the site which had the most links removed , followed by the social network search site @entity189 and video sharing site @entity191			0
last year , the foundation which operates @entity193 described the rule as ' unforgivable censorship '			0
speaking at the announcement of the @entity199 's first - ever transparency report in @entity200 , @entity193 founder @entity196 said the public had the ' right to remember '			2
‘ we are on a path to secret , online sanitation of truthful information , ’ said @entity203 , general counsel at the @entity199			0
‘ no matter how well it may be intended , it is compromising human rights , the freedom of expression and access to information , and we can not forget that			0
‘ so we have to expose it and we have to reject this kind of censorship			0
’ @entity23 's top court ruled that people have the right to have ' inadequate ' and ' irrelevant ' results about them wiped from the web , which has led to the search engine being bombarded with requests			2
more than 200,000 removal requests involving more than 700,000 urls have been made to @entity0 worldwide			2
the content itself has not been deleted from @entity28 , but @entity0 will not list it in search results			1
instead , users searching for the topic on google.co.uk will see a message that says : ‘ some results may have been removed under data protection law in @entity23 ’ at the bottom of the page			0
