as @entity1 sat down to have his say on thursday , it was easy to forget that @entity3 have a critical game against their top - four rivals @entity5 on saturday			1
instead , there was only one issue on the agenda , brought about by @entity10 's television interview 24 hours earlier			1
the interview in which he suddenly seemed happy to discuss that unsigned £ 100,000 - a - week contract , assert he is a trophy - hunter rather than a money - grabber and , perhaps most alarming of all , admit he is flattered by interest from saturday 's opponents from north @entity18			1
@entity10 looks relaxed during @entity3 's training session on thursday morning @entity10 shakes hands with his manager @entity1 during the @entity23 training session @entity10 appeared to give his manager a pat on the back as they talked during training @entity1 issues instructions to @entity10 as @entity3 prepare for saturday 's match with @entity5 instead of talking about the race for a @entity33 pot of gold , @entity1 found himself again discussing the subject of @entity10 's silver			1
the response seemed well prepared , a message of solidarity combined with a show of strength			2
@entity10 is going nowhere was the emphatic statement			1
and if there were any suggestion from the 20 - year - old that @entity3 need to convince him they can match his ambition , the message from @entity1 was equally clear : count yourself lucky to be here			1
' @entity5 is a fantastic football club , of course , but this is @entity3 , one of the great clubs of the football world , ' said the @entity53 boss ' it 's an honour for @entity10 to play here at a club like @entity3 in front of our great supporters and he understands that			1
' if @entity10 has said his ambition is to win trophies and be successful , then it 's perfectly aligned with what we 're trying to do			1
' there was a reminder to @entity10 and his representatives that his stock has risen on the back of the work @entity3 have done with him and the faith @entity1 has placed in the player			1
he is , @entity1 remarked , not yet the finished article			1
not yet of the same calibre as @entity78 who eventually got his move away from @entity81			2
@entity10 admitted he was ' flattered ' by interest from @entity5 as his contract talks are put on hold @entity10 and @entity85 share a joke on the training ground during thursday morning 's session the players were in a relaxed mood despite the continued speculation over @entity10 's future at the club the @entity95 international cast doubt on his @entity3 future in an interview with the @entity98 on wednesday ' now , as a 20 - year - old , no he 's not at that level , ' said @entity1			1
' @entity10 has been involved with the first team for two - and - a - half years and the player he is today — and he still has a lot of improvements to make — is because of the environment and what we 've created here			1
' he 's still got learning and development to make on and off the pitch			2
we feel this is a great place for him			2
we 'll very much focus on trying to make him the best player we can			2
' he 's a young player who has developed a lot and that 's because of one reason , which is @entity3			2
so we 're quite relaxed on that and we 'll concentrate on his football , hopefully			0
' for us it 's really about continuing to nurture the development of a young player who has made huge strides and someone who we believe we still have a lot of input into his development to come so he can be consistently a player playing at the top of his game			0
' there is a growing feeling that @entity10 and his representatives are attempting to force @entity3 's hand here and orchestrate a move back to @entity18 , where @entity5 and @entity134 would welcome him home with open arms			1
certainly the mixed messages over the contract stalemate in recent months have been confusing			2
is it about money ? is it about trophies ? is it about @entity10 's best position ? sterling trains alongside @entity146 @entity145 as the @entity3 team get ready for saturday 's match @entity10 and @entity149 leap during one of the training ground exercises on thursday morning @entity10 takes his turn on the ladders as @entity3 prepare for saturday 's vital match against @entity5 the latter , according to @entity1 , should not be an issue			1
most important of all is that @entity10 is a first - team regular getting the kind of opportunities that young players do not elsewhere			1
the manager drew comparisons with @entity163			0
' every player will have a position to play , ' he said			0
' i pick the best team and what is key for him — and i 'm sure he understands — is that he 's getting the opportunity to play			0
' if you look through this league and in @entity173 , there are n't many playing at 17 , 18 , 19 or 20			0
' every player will want to play but he only needs to look at @entity163 in his time here			0
he played in a back three , as a wing back , right back , left back , central midfield , as a @entity178			0
' it does n't bother me			0
i pick the best team and he will probably sit back , reflect and think he is playing , which not many young kids are			0
' he 's a boy who genuinely loves his football			0
he 's played all over the field for me but he understands and respects the opportunity that he 's had to play all over the field			0
it 's been great for him and his career			0
' @entity10 denied he was a ' money - grabber ' in the interview , saying he was only concerned about football @entity3 find themselves five points behind @entity192 in the battle for the top four places @entity1 organises the footballs during @entity3 's thursday morning training session there is little doubt that @entity10 's interview has been unhelpful in the extreme , but there remains a determination at @entity53 to keep the player onside and head off a contract crisis			1
to that end , @entity1 struck a conciliatory tone on thursday			2
' we speak regularly with @entity10 and i just see him work and work well , ' @entity1 said			1
' he 's been injured and there is probably a bit of frustration there because he 's not been totally clear and he 's a boy who just loves to play , train and be on the field			0
' you have seen what can happen with players and representatives , but i can only speak openly and honestly with @entity10			2
he has made it clear he is happy and hopefully he can do his talking on the field			0
' my concentration is on working with the player			0
he is a young man			0
he has had trauma in his life and he is a tough boy and you see that in how he plays , but he is still very young			0
he still needs guidance and help — that is pretty clear			0
' @entity228 , who trained wearing a red and white snood , in action at @entity23 @entity231 tries to run the ball away from @entity233 during a practice match in thursday 's training @entity236 finds himself sandwiched by @entity228 and @entity10 during the game @entity1 shakes the hand of @entity239 as @entity3 get ready for their encounter with @entity5 @entity1 gives @entity145 a pat on the back as the @entity243 make their preparations for the trip to @entity5 captain @entity163 pings one of his trademark passes in the training session at @entity23			1
