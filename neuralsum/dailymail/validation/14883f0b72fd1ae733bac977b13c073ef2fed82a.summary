a @entity1 boss has insulted nearly half the country by dismissing them using marketing jargon			1
creative director @entity5 was trying to rebut the allegation that the corporation caters only for the ‘ metropolitan elite ’			2
the executive , who earns around £ 330,000 a year , insisted that the @entity1 appeals to all sorts of audiences because it airs programmes that ‘ reach out to … @entity14 [ and ] des ’			2
mr @entity5 ’s extraordinary declaration on @entity42 on wednesday was an attempt to prove what an inclusive organisation the @entity1 is , amid concern that a huge swathe of its audience will stop tuning in now @entity23 has been axed from @entity49			1
however , his comments backfired as viewers used social media to accuse him of arrogance and sounding so ‘ out of touch ’ they thought it was a spoof			0
they accused mr @entity5 of using obscure jargon that only the metropolitan elite would understand , in a way that suggested that working class viewers are a niche audience			1
@entity61 , @entity61 mp for @entity62 , accused mr @entity5 of ‘ arrogance ’ which only confirmed his status as part of the metropolitan elite			2
he said : ‘ in essence , he ’s admitting that the @entity1 does n’t do much for the working classes , and he is doing that in a way that is not making it easy for many people to understand			2
’ mr @entity5 – who earns more than £ 180,000 a year as creative director as well as an estimated £ 150,000 fee for editing and presenting the @entity1 arts series imagine – made the remarks as he attempted to explain the decision to fire @entity23			1
mr @entity5 was appearing on @entity42 to defend the sacking of @entity23 , whose contract is not being renewed after he attacked @entity49 producer @entity80 twitter user @entity81 wrote : ' @entity5 describes all those who are n't ' metropolitan elite ' as @entity85			1
our licence fee is so well spent on this man of the people # newsnight ' the terms @entity14 and @entity91 are marketing terms to describe working class people presenter @entity95 asked if getting rid of the @entity49 host would make it harder for the @entity1 to reach ‘ a demographic ... increasingly disregarded ’ by a corporation which ‘ plays largely to the metropolitan elite ’			1
apparently unaware of the irony , mr @entity5 responded : ‘ i do n’t know that i would buy that , actually , about the metropolitan elite			0
' there are quite a lot of programmes which reach out to audiences which are @entity14 , @entity107 , which are n’t the metropolitan elite			0

@entity21 ( 21 per cent ) is skilled manual while @entity35 ( 26 per cent ) is semi-skilled and unskilled , plus the unemployed			0
others questioned whether the @entity1 really were keen to make programmes that appealed to all audiences @entity121 said : ' only metropolitan elite luvvies speak like @entity5 on @ @entity123 - he 's in more opaque bubble than @entity126 politicians # @entity23 ' a @entity1 spokesman said : ‘ there ’s nothing elitist about making programmes and services used by 97 per cent of people every week , and that ’s the point @entity134 made			1
’ mr @entity5 admitted that axing @entity23 marked ‘ a bad day ’ for the @entity1			1
but he said director general @entity136 felt he had no choice after the @entity49 star ’s unprovoked physical and verbal attack on his producer			0
however , he refused to rule out @entity23 returning to the @entity1			2
@entity23 attacked mr @entity80 ( pictured ) leaving him in such a state that he later took himself to @entity143 the @entity1 has said that @entity49 will continue without @entity23 , but there are doubts as to whether co-presenters @entity146 and @entity148 will return consumers are sometimes grouped into classes or social grades used to describe their social grade and earnings for market research purposes			1
