@entity20 tweeted : ' please , please , please do n't visit hospital if you 've had vomiting or diarrhoea tummy bug in last 48 hours ( 2 days ) ... ! ' @entity20 has taken to @entity15 , pleading with infected people to stay away a spokeswoman for @entity7 's @entity6 said it was a precautionary measure , to stop the spread of the virus ahead of @entity29			1
in a statement , the hospital said : ' members of the public are urged not to come to @entity34 if they have diarrhoea and vomiting symptoms , unless they need emergency medical treatment			2
instead , they should telephone their gp or @entity39			0
' people suffering with symptoms who are due to attend the hospital for an appointment should telephone the hospital first			0
' wards excluded by the ban are critical care , paediatrics , maternity , outpatients and the @entity7 & @entity50			1
the spokeswoman said the restriction would hopefully be lifted within a week			0
@entity53 , chief nurse at the hospital , told the @entity55 : ‘ @entity56 is a problem that 's out in the community and it comes into hospitals and then causes us problems in the hospital , so the more we can stop people coming and going … the more likely we are to get on top of this quickly			0
‘ as soon as these things crop up on the wards we isolate patients , make sure staff are n't moving around , close the affected ward to visitors , increase cleaning and reinforce infection control practice			2
' we 've currently got three wards confirmed with norovirus and a fourth ward that we 're suspicious has norovirus , and then [ possibly ] a fifth ward down at @entity79 hospital as well			0
' @entity7 's @entity6 announced today it is closed to visitors , after an outbreak of the bug forced the closure of four wards ms @entity53 said that about 34 patients are currently affected and a ' handful of staff '			1
anyone showing symptoms of the bug is urged to stay away , as it is highly contagious			1
the virus spreads rapidly in closed environments such as hospitals , schools , nursing and residential homes			0
last week , patients at @entity99 were banned from receiving visitors , after a prolonged outbreak of the vomiting bug continued to plague the hospital			1
and last month , @entity104 banned visitors from entering six wards at following an outbreak			2
hundreds of hospital wards have been forced to close due to the spread of norovirus , as fears grow that this winter 's outbreak could prove to be the worst on record			1
new figures released this week by the @entity115 revealed cases of the bug are at a five - year high - with more than two - thirds as many people struck down this year as during the same period in 2011			1
the huge early outbreak is thought to represent the worst start to the norovirus season on record , with some experts blaming particularly frigid november temperatures for the staggering numbers of cases			2
the new @entity115 figures show there have been 2,630 confirmed cases - where samples have been checked in the lab - since july			0
this is 72 per cent higher than the same period in the last season when there were 1,533 cases reported			2
but this figure is likely to be only a fraction of the true total as most sufferers do not see their gp			0
officials at the @entity115 estimate that for every confirmed case there are another 288 in the community			0
this means that 757,440 people could have been affected .			0

@entity7 's @entity6 has imposed the ban until further notice after an outbreak of the bug forced four wards to close
comes as @entity155 & @entity156 trust takes to @entity15 , *begging* those with any symptoms to stay away
cases of winter vomiting bug up 72 *%* on last year
