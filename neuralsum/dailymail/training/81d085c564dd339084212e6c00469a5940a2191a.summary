according to one estimate by scientists from @entity46 ( @entity46 ) , the @entity8 and @entity7 deltas have combined to grow by 2.8 square kilometers ( 1 square mile ) per year			1

the @entity8 is a distributary of the @entity3 that connects to the ' @entity70 ' in south central @entity71 near @entity72			1
@entity7 , an artificial channel designed to reduce the severity of floods in @entity76 , delivers about 40 percent of the @entity8 's water into the bay about 16 kilometers ( 10 miles ) west of where the main river empties			1
the deltas ' rate of growth has varied considerably , mainly due to the timing of major floods and hurricanes			2
floods transport large volumes of extra sediment to @entity5 , while hurricanes redistribute sediment within the bay and transport it offshore into deeper waters			1
hurricanes also destroy coastal vegetation that would otherwise protect land from erosion			2
the @entity8 delta has grown at a faster rate than its neighbor — about 1.6 ( 0.6 square miles ) square kilometers per year , versus 1.2 square kilometers ( 0.46 square miles ) per year for the @entity98			1
the difference is due to regular dredging and channel widening on the lower @entity8 , which delivers extra sediment to its delta			1
due to the lack of dredging , @entity7 delta is more natural in character , with a more symmetric , lobate shape			1
geologists first noticed mud deposits building up in @entity5 in the 1950s , but new land first rose above the water line in 1973 after a severe flood			1
' we are looking carefully at the @entity7 and @entity8 deltas as models for building new land and preserving some of our coastal marshlands , ' said @entity122 , director of the @entity123 at @entity46			1
' if we start diverting significant portions of the water and sediment from the main channel of the @entity3 into adjacent wetlands , lakes , and bays — as happens now in @entity5 — we 'll be taking an important first step toward saving a significant part of @entity71 's coastal plain			2
' elsewhere , the delta plain of the @entity3 is disappearing			0
the lobe - shaped arc of coastal land from the @entity138 in eastern @entity71 to the @entity139 loses a football field 's worth of land every hour			0
put another way , the delta has shrunk by nearly 5,000 square kilometers ( 2,000 square miles ) over the past 80 years .			0

most areas of the delta are losing ground due to *climate* change
team found land is forming in @entity5 at the mouths of the @entity7 and the @entity8
say they could develop *technique* based on the natural *accumulation* to help losses elsewhere
