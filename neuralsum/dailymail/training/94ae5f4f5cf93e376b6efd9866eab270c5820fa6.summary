president @entity1 's top military adviser said sunday that while he has n't seen the need for ground troops in @entity5 so far , there 's a strong chance combat troops will be needed to fight the @entity7 in the future			1
' yeah , there will be circumstances when the answer to that question will likely be yes , ' gen. @entity9 , chairman of the @entity10 , said in an interview with @entity16 that aired on @entity17			1
' but i have n't encountered one right now , ' he added			1
@entity9 's interview aired on the same day defense secretary @entity21 warned that @entity23 radicals are perilously close to taking a key city along @entity26 's border with @entity27			1
a @entity40 official told @entity47 that fighters on the ground do not have enough weapons			2
and ' without weaponry , is not going to make a critical difference , ' he said			0
a senior @entity54 official , @entity53 , told the @entity55 on friday that airstrikes had not deterred @entity38 and warned that a massacre would occur if the international community did not step in			2
he also urged @entity27 to open a closed - off corridor to @entity40 's remaining residents and to allow arms to flow through the country to @entity54 fighting against @entity38 just over the border			1
@entity27 has been unwilling to intervene in the violence taking place in the @entity26 city , even after the @entity67 dispatched gen. @entity68 to the country last thursday to plead for their help			1
@entity68 is coordinating the @entity1 administration 's assault on @entity38			2
the @entity26 border state has long said its strategy would focus on taking out its neighboring country 's corrupt president , @entity74 , not @entity23 radicals			1
' the government is not going to budge on this , ' a @entity27 official told the @entity80 on friday			2
' as long as you have @entity74 there , with his policies of dropping barrel bombs , chemical weapons , this vicious cycle is going to continue on and on with more groups , different groups , coming in			0
' the @entity36 has also refused to engage @entity38 militarily in @entity26 , even as it has acknowledged the limitations of it 's airstrike campaign			1
gen. @entity9 confirmed sunday that it is becoming more and more difficult for the @entity36 to identify suitable targets in @entity5 and @entity26 to bomb as the war against @entity38 rages on			1
' an enemy adapts and they â€™ll be harder to target , ' @entity9 said			2
' they know how to maneuver and how to use populations and concealment			0
' in a portion of the interview that aired earlier in the week , @entity9 told @entity104 ' @entity103 that @entity38 is ' becoming more savvy with the use of electronic devices			1
' ' they do n't fly flags and move around in large convoys the way they did			0
... they do n't establish headquarters that are visible or identifiable			0
' the four - star general did not specifically advocate for the use of @entity36 combat forces in the battle against @entity38 , but he 's said in the past that he would make that recommendation if push came to shove			1
a circumstance that could call for @entity36 military involvement on the ground , for example , would be a mission to retake the @entity5 city of @entity127 , @entity9 told a @entity129 committee last month , speaking hypothetically			1
national security adviser @entity130 told @entity132 host @entity131 yesterday that up to this point , however , ' there has been no recommendation ' by ' military commanders , either on the ground , nor here in @entity139 , that the @entity36 put any ground combat forces into @entity5			1
' that has not come up the chain to anybody at the @entity144			0
and i do n't anticipate that it will , ' she said , citing the president 's promises that he would not send @entity36 troops into @entity5 to engage in combat			1
' the president has been very plain that this is not a campaign that requires or even would benefit from @entity36 ground troops in combat again			2
' president @entity1 meets with military senior leadership to receive an update on the campaign to combat @entity7 last wednesday			0
secretary of defense @entity21 , left , and @entity9 , right , sit next to the president			1
@entity161 cautioned on sunday that @entity38 was dangerously close to taking control of @entity40 , a @entity26 city that 's a stone 's throw away from @entity27 smoke rises from the @entity26 town of @entity40 this morning			1
an @entity7 suicide bomber detonated a truck laden with explosives on monday in the besieged @entity54 town near the @entity27 border crossing with @entity26 , a monitoring group and @entity54 sources said the @entity1 administration official said the @entity36 ' previous involvement in @entity5 serves as proof that the country will not be able to stave off terrorists like @entity38 after the @entity36 leaves if its citizens ' are n't willing and committed ' to protecting their country			1
' it 's not going to happen overnight			0
but if it is n't achieved , nothing is going to be sustainable , ' she said			0
' so people need to understand there are going to be good days , bad days , victories , and setbacks , as the @entity5 themselves take this fight to @entity38			1
' @entity191 threw her full support behind the president 's strategy to eliminate @entity38 and encouraged @entity1 's critics to give him more breathing room			2
' this is going to take time , ' she said			0
' it ca n't judged by merely what happens in one particular town or in one particular region			0
' the @entity36 people need to understand that our aim here is long - term degradation and building the capacity of our partners			2
' @entity27 soldiers hold their position on a tank as they keep an eye on @entity40 on monday			2
the strategic border town , located just a mile outside of @entity27 , has been beseiged by @entity7 militants since mid-september meanwhile , @entity38 has inched closer and closer to taking control of @entity40 , which is located less than a mile away from the country 's border with @entity27			1
the @entity7 is also making an aggressive play for the @entity222 airport in @entity5			0
@entity224 sen. @entity223 , a member of the @entity129 's @entity226 and @entity227 committees , said sunday that he believes @entity38 could capture the airport in @entity5 's capitol city			1
' they 're winning , and we 're not , ' @entity223 said of @entity38 on @entity231 's @entity230			2
' the @entity5 are not winning			0
the @entity232 , the @entity54 are not winning			0
' there has to be a fundamental re-evaluation of what we 're doing because we are not ... " degrading and ultimately destroying @entity38 " ' as the @entity1 administration has said it would , @entity223 said			0
the former @entity224 presidential nominee said the @entity36 needed to provide arms to both the @entity232 and moderate rebels who are part of the @entity242			0
he also called on president @entity1 to expand his strategy against @entity38 to include deposing @entity74			0
' you have to go after @entity38 and @entity74 at the same time or you will not succeed , ' he said			0
former @entity223 adviser and business executive @entity246 separately argued on @entity248 that @entity1 has to follow through on his previous promise to hold @entity74 accountable for his actions			0
@entity1 has said he wants @entity74 out , but he ' clearly does n't believe , ' @entity246 , a dark horse 2016 presidential candidate , charged			0
she further claimed that @entity1 ' never had a strategy in @entity26 ' and ' there is no explanation ' for the way he 's inconsistent policies toward the country			2
' meanwhile , things continue to go from bad to worse , ' she said , according to @entity259 .			0
