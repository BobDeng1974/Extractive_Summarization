@entity0 is best known for her somewhat controversial ' i quit @entity3 ' diet , and now she 's suggesting something else be left out of people 's lives - bicycle helmets			1
a photo posted to @entity8 on monday night purported to show what roads looked like before and after mandatory bicycle helmet laws were introduced in @entity12 , making the point that less people take to the roads on their bikes than they did decades ago			1
' this is what happened when mandatory helmet laws were introduced into @entity12 , ' the caption on the image read			1
@entity0 , author of i quit @entity3 has spoken out against mandatory bicycle helmet laws @entity21 is known as an avid bike rider and is big on encouraging people to take up the extra physical activity along with a healthy lifestyle			1
and while this is not the first time the blogger has voiced her opinion on the matter saying she was against the laws , the debate was reignited , leaving many outraged			2
the backlash from fans was swift , with commenters deeming her opinion dangerous , ill - informed and irresponsible given her platform			0
' this seems like an incredibly irresponsible statement to be making , @entity0 , ' one outraged woman posted			2
but she was met with fierce backlash online with people branding her opinion ' dangerous ' others were ' disappointed ' with @entity21 's ' irresponsible ' approach to bike riding @entity21 has previously sparked the same debate through a series of blog post a few years back ' for someone with an obvious interest in health and wellbeing you seem cavalier in your attitude towards the prevention of traumatic brain injuries and neurological deficits			1
your opinion on this subject defies what i had perceived to be intelligence , ' the comment continued			0
' i 'm a cyclist who was hit by a driver who did n't stop at a stop sign , ' another user wrote			0
' i was wearing a helmet but still ended up in @entity70 's emergency ward			0
i would have ended up in the morgue not wearing one			0
for those who do n't think it 's important to wear a helmet , you are plainly stupid and have never experienced actually being hit by a car			2
this woman questioned the author 's attitude to helmets given her focus on healthy living others brought in statistics to back up their claims that bicycle helmets save lives mandatory helmet laws were brought into effect in @entity12 from 1990 , and was the first to make it illegal not to wear a helmet ' i 'm really disappointed @entity0			1
i wo n't be following you any longer as people 's lives are saved by wearing helmets whilst cycling when they are on the roads			2
this is even more imperative on @entity102 roads as @entity102 drivers are particularly aggressive towards cyclists , ' the post concluded			0
in an earlier blog post @entity21 addressed the issue saying that she was against the compulsory nature of the bike helmet laws not the laws themselves , but also claimed there was little scientific evidence to prove that helmets actually saved lives			1
the posts sits under subheadings such as ' helmet laws make riding more dangerous ' and ' there â€™s inconclusive proof helmets save lives or limit injuries '			1
this woman suggested she may boycott @entity21 's healthy way of living others did agree with the author 's unpopular opinion '' helmets deter people from riding ' @entity21 wrote in a blog post in 2010 ' helmets deter people from riding			1
but regular riders live longer because the health effects of cycling far outweigh the risk of death from crashing			0
there is ample data to back this , ' @entity21 wrote in 2010			2
also on her blog she has admitted to struggling with the ' style ' element of wearing a helmet			0
' i promote riding unencumbered by style restraints			0
but helmets just ruin the whole flow , especially for a chick , ' she revealed			0
mandatory helmet laws were brought into effect in @entity12 from 1990 , and was the first country to make it illegal not to wear a helmet .			1
