by @entity0 plans are at an advanced stage for a @entity4 football competition within @entity5 to spice up the much - maligned friendly dates in the international calendar			1
the @entity9 initiative , which is expected to win support from the 54 national associations , will be further developed at the annual @entity12 in @entity13 next month , with a start date scheduled for 2018 after the @entity15 in @entity16			1
the latest developments come as the @entity18 recognise a need for quality friendlies to fill @entity21 in the wake of such an uninspiring @entity24 fixture list that practically guarantees qualification			0
new ideas : @entity9 president @entity27 is supporting a new @entity29 tournament challenge : @entity31 would face @entity5 countries in a league format before progressing to a knockout competition under the plans big draw : facing some of @entity5 's top countries could help the @entity18 avoid empty seats at @entity21 , like there were against @entity40 last year the proposed @entity4 format , to be played over a two - year period with semi-finals and final in a year without a major championship , would see the 54 countries split into various leagues offering promotion , relegation and wild card places at @entity50			1
@entity31 would expect to be in the top division of 12 countries , split into four groups of three to provide a last - four for the knockout stages			1
on top of that set of matches , the @entity18 would still have occasional friendly dates on which to play showcase opponents , such as the @entity60 or @entity61			2
option : the @entity18 will still be able to host top tier friendlies , like the one played against the @entity60 in may 2013 a significant number of the @entity67 5,000 - strong membership will not be impressed by the famous cricket charity honouring @entity69 at a big lord ’s function in april given the controversial way he quit international cricket in the middle of the disastrous @entity76 tour			1
honoured : former @entity31 star @entity69 will be the centre of attention at a @entity67 function in april , despite retiring from international cricket during the recent @entity76 series however @entity67 chief executive @entity82 said : ‘ i know there are members who are disappointed at the way @entity69 retired , but we are celebrating his great career			1
’ ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
@entity31 manager @entity88 was talking on @entity89 on monday night about the possibility of taking a psychologist to @entity61 to help with the mental side of penalty shoot - outs			1
alongside him , @entity94 expressed his belief that the pressure on penalty takers on the long walk from the halfway line to the spot is all in the head			0
yet @entity89 presenter @entity102 missed an open goal by not asking former @entity31 boss @entity94 about the astonishing revelation in his @entity106 98 book that his one big mistake was not having wacky faith - healer @entity108 with the @entity31 team			2
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... the @entity111 are ‘ very confident ’ of securing title sponsors for the @entity113 by the end of the year			1
with the help of @entity117 , they are concentrating on finding backing for their flagship venue with the potential selling point of various rights for the other facilities being bundled into an @entity113 deal			2
however , the stadium , now bereft of its landmark triangular floodlights , looks a sorry sight compared to the stunning @entity127 , which has been restored to its original @entity129 design without the spectator wings			0
money to be made : the @entity111 believe they will find a title sponsor for the @entity113 by the end of 2014 @entity135 stars hog limelight breakfast tv cameras crews who had been booked to film the public opening of the @entity127 were diverted at the last moment for a media opportunity with @entity144 ’s @entity143 medallists - much to the chagrin of the @entity111			1
a @entity147 spokesman said : ‘ we were just responding to the interest			0
’ meanwhile diver @entity150 just happened to be doing a training exercise on steps close to where photographers were gathered			0
but pool staff insist it was n’t staged and say @entity150 is in training most days at the @entity127 , which opens to the public from saturday			0
ready to go : the @entity127 used at the @entity157 opens to the public on saturday preparation : @entity144 diver @entity150 , pictured here at last week 's brit awards , now trains at the @entity162 architect @entity129 , who somehow likes the eyesore that is @entity164 ’s vanity orbit structure next to her work of art , has two big sports stadium designs on the go - in @entity167 for the @entity168 and a @entity170 2022 venue			2
about the scandalous death toll among @entity170 ’s immigrant construction workforce , @entity129 said : ‘ i have nothing to do with the workers			0
it ’s an issue for the government			0
i ’m more concerned about the deaths in @entity178			0
’ focused : @entity127 architect @entity129 ( left ) , who has designed one of @entity170 's @entity15 stadiums , has refused to get involved with deaths in the country			2

@entity9 plan to start a new @entity4 @entity5 competition in 2018
a total of 54 countries , *including* @entity31 , would compete in a two - year tournament
a league format would offer promotion , relegation and wild card places at @entity50
@entity69 set to be honoured at @entity67 function in april
@entity88 admits a sports psychologist could travel with @entity31 to the @entity15 in @entity61
@entity111 confident of finding title sponsors for the @entity113
