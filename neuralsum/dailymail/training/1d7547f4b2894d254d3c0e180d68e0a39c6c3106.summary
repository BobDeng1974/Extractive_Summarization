he might not be speaking the same language as most of his players but @entity3 has had no trouble getting his message through to them in his first full week of training			1
they all go into friday night 's game against @entity10 knowing that intensity is the watchword and with the sound of him shouting ' go go go ! ' at them on the training pitches of @entity15			2
' the coach has told us he wants us moving the ball quicker ' says defender @entity21 who also admits that @entity3 wants his team to lose their lightweight pushover tag and become more difficult to play against			2
they played decent enough football under sacked @entity26 but the tempo was slow and when they lost the ball they lacked the aggression to win it back quickly			0
@entity3 is adapting to life as @entity34 manager ahead of friday night 's match against @entity10 ' we are not the biggest team and we know we have to compensate for that by getting close to the opposition , by upsetting them , and by being a nuisance ' , he said			1
the @entity3 message appears to be sinking in with the players responding well to the new man despite the demands and the double training sessions that have come with them			1
last week was a welcomed first point for the new boss and now they want a winning start at @entity50 against @entity10			0
once again @entity3 will be without central defender @entity51 who pulled out of the opening fixture against @entity53 just before kick - off			2
he has the quality to be one of the pillars of @entity3 ' team and he has also taken on - board the message despite it being delivered in his new coach 's broad @entity61 accent			2
@entity3 is determined to get his side making life more uncomfortable for their opponents despite the language barrier , @entity3 is already beginning to get his message accross video @entity3 pleased with @entity34 debut @entity70 ; @entity71 , @entity21 , @entity72 , @entity73 ; @entity74 ; @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 ; @entity79 ' there is no problem with understanding him , ' he says			1
' the translator is there for that and you get plenty of your message across with gestures too			0
we know he wants 100 per cent from us in every game in every tackle			0
' @entity3 will hope that if @entity97 are allowed to sign a player to cover @entity100 's likely five - month absence ( they are currently investigating the possibility ) they do not look to @entity51 who has been a target in the past			0
he will want the @entity104 21 international when he returns to fitness			0
' when we played against @entity106 last season we noticed that they were physically much stronger than us ' @entity51 adds on the subject of @entity3 ' efforts to toughen up the group he has inherited			1
@entity74 ( back ) is already becoming a crucial player for @entity3 as he establishes his values @entity34 looked harder to beat than previously this season in their first game under @entity3 the former @entity106 and @entity116 manager will pick an unchanged defence from the one that kept a clean sheet in @entity121 and will once again have @entity122 in front of the back - four shielding the defence			1
he is another who looks like becoming one of the cornerstones of this team			0
' the training sessions are short but very intense , ' says the midfielder			1
' he wants us on top of the opposition and he wants us making challenges			0
' so far supporters are happy with the direction @entity3 has taken			1
' @entity136 ' had become too easy to beat this season and fans saw against @entity53 that that will no longer be the case			0
tonight the visitors are @entity10 who have yet to lose this month but are still in the bottom three			0
@entity3 is likely to bring experienced playmaker @entity77 into the team at the expense of @entity145 but will ask for the same again from his players : intensity , and the first victory of a new era .			1

@entity3 earned a draw in his first game in charge of @entity155 club
former @entity106 boss making @entity34 harder to beat
@entity3 has *implemented* double training sessions but players are happy
