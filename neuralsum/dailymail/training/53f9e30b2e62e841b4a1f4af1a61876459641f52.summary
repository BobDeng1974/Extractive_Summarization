by @entity0 an @entity2 socialist organisation hit with a fierce wave of backlash over the cover of one of their publications has been forced to withdraw the offending image			1
@entity12 , an online newspaper published by the @entity13 , recalled a cover which featured the prime minister with a razor to his throat , the headline ' one cut we 'd like to see ' splashed below			1
the cartoon is based on a poster by @entity20 from 1977 , which sees former prime minister @entity21 with a blade to his neck with ' @entity24 the razor ' written underneath			1
this image of @entity27 with a razor to his throat sparked outrage on the @entity13 's @entity31 page and they were forced to withdraw the cover the poster was prompted by @entity21 's decision to block supply which ultimately led to the @entity39 government 's dismissal in 1975			1
in a statement released by the @entity41 on tuesday morning @entity12 editors defended the message sent by the cover but said they were forced to withdraw it citing ' legal concerns '			2
' " @entity24 the razor ! " was chanted by demonstrators in @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 at mass rallies and strikes ... the slogan appeared on placards , posters , and graffiti			0
it was even set to music , ' they wrote			0
' @entity27 ’s budget , and the @entity64 plans for slashing welfare and cutting wages , is far worse than anything that @entity21 carried out when prime minister			1
' news.com.au report that before the original post with the image of @entity27 was pulled down off the @entity72 , it recieved hundreds of comments against the ' violent ' image			2
the cover was inspired by @entity20 's 1977 poster which featured former prime minister @entity21 with the slogan ' give @entity21 the @entity78 ' ' oh ... not cool			1
i ’m no fan of the @entity80 — policies , parties , associates or leader — but this seems unnecessarily violent , ' wrote one user , while another said ' dreadful picture			0
do not condone violence to anyone			0
you lost me off this page and as a supporter			0
' however the @entity12 deny that they were trying to incite any physical forms of violence with the image			2
' the razor was and is clearly metaphorical			0
just as cartoons that depict @entity99 knifing @entity100 in the back are not suggestive of an actual physical attack but merely are visual representations of perceived betrayal , so the razor in both our cover and the original poster suggest that the prime minister should be cast aside			1
@entity12 deny they tried to incite any violence with the cover , but make no apology for the statement they made with the image ' it is the height of hypocrisy to make a song and dance about an allegorical newspaper cover , while defending a government which just last week announced that it wishes to deport asylum seekers who have anything less than a 50/50 chance of being tortured or persecuted if they are returned to their “ home country ”			1
@entity12 editors @entity128 and @entity130 closed the statement with ' the difference between this threat of actual violence and an allegorical cover could not be plainer , ' reiterating that they make no apology for the cover			2
historically , the razor is considered to be a symbol of @entity2 's corrupt past , and was also used by gangs as a violent weapon during the @entity142			0
the original poster featuring @entity21 was sparked after the 1975 constitutional crisis - also known simply as the dismissal			0
@entity21 came in to power as the 22nd @entity146 of @entity2 after he played a key role in the dismissal of @entity39 .			0
