peanuts cause allergic reactions chiefly when they have been dry - roasted , a study suggests			1
tests carried out by @entity5 researchers found that eaten raw the nuts had little effect on the immune system			1
they are now working on safe , dry - roasted peanuts to help prevent an allergy that affects one in 50 children			1
peanuts cause allergic reactions chiefly when they have been dry - roasted , a study suggests ( file picture ) ‘ we did a simple experiment and found that the mice fed the dry - roasted proteins got an immune response indicative of allergy , ’ said researcher @entity17			2
‘ whereas the mice fed the raw peanut proteins did n’t or did to a much lesser extent			0
’ the result was the same whether the mice were fed peanut protein or had it rubbed into broken skin – both ways in which peanuts are thought to trigger allergies in humans			0
professor @entity17 added : ‘ this is the first time , to our knowledge , that a potential trigger for peanut allergy has been directly shown			0
’ the finding helps explain why peanut allergy is much more common here than in the @entity44 , where the nuts are more commonly eaten raw , boiled or fried			0
it is believed that the process of dry - roasting involves temperatures high enough to change the peanut ’s chemistry in a way that confuses the immune system and leads to allergic reactions			2
it will be some years before safer dry - roasted peanuts are on supermarket shelves and the complex nature of the immune system means that those who already have a peanut allergy are unlikely to be helped			1
while the majority of reactions are mild , nut allergy can trigger a life - threatening anaphylactic shock			2
the @entity5 team said it would be premature for people to avoid the nuts because of their research , published in the @entity69 .			0

raw nuts have little effect on the immune system , researchers find
@entity5 study *paves* the way for safer dry - roasted peanuts
peanut allergies , which can be life - threatening , affect one in 50 children
