by @entity0 published : 05:07 est , 9 july 2012 updated : 06:23 est , 9 july 2012 a controversial @entity2 circumcision practice in which the blood of a baby 's cut penis is sucked by a religious leader has been condemned after the deaths of two infants			1
the ' metzitzah b'peh ' performed by @entity9 sees the eight - day old baby have a traditional circumcision but the ' mohel ' then places his mouth around the wound and sucks up the blood			1
but the practice - intended to prevent infection - has sparked controversy in recent years after the death of two infants and the cntraction of herpes in at least 11 others between november 2000 and december 2011			1
controversial : a mohel , left , prepares to carry out a circumcision on a baby boy as prayers are read during a traditional @entity2 ceremony ( file picture ) heath chiefs in @entity31 are now pushing through regulation forcing anybody wishing to have the procedure carried out on their babies to sign a consent waiver			1
but some @entity37 have complained about the measures claiming that they infringe on their ' religious freedom '			1
rabbi @entity40 , professor of @entity41 and @entity42 at @entity43 , told @entity44 that the practice was ' primitive nonsense '			1
' the ritual has nothing to do with religion			2
it 's only their customs			0
but they 've managed to convince the city that it 's a violation of their religious freedoms , ' he added			0
circumcision rituals originate from @entity59 , in which @entity60 tells @entity61 that all men must be circumcised eight days after they are born			0
jews believed that blood was the ' life - giving element ' and sucking it from the baby 's penis was initially thought to prevent infection			1
but medical advances over the last hundred years have made clear that it can actually spread diseases			0
it is practiced widely in @entity74 and among @entity75			0
devout : three young ultra orthodox jews in traditional clothing			0
the suction practice is carried out among strict followers of the religion ( file picture ) homeland : there were almost 20,500 metzitzah b'peh procedures in @entity31 in june this year but the practice is carried out widely in @entity74 , pictured numbers of cases in @entity31 alone emerged after the city 's health department launched an investigation following the deaths			1
the most recent of the deaths was in @entity92 last september and a criminal investigation is still ongoing			0
the earlier death was in november 2004 , when a twin caught herpes after undergoing the procedure			2
almost 20,500 baby boys had the procedure carried out in @entity31 in june this year			2
some jews have started using pipettes instead of oral suction because they are more hygienic according to the findings of the investigation , infants who were circumcise with suction between april 2006 and december 2012 had a risk of catching neonatal herpes ( @entity108 - 1 ) infection of 24.4 per 100,000 cases			0
@entity31 health commissioner dr. @entity110 said in a statement : ' there is no safe way to perform oral suction on any open wound in a newborn			2
' parents considering ritual circumcision need to know that circumcision should only be performed under sterile conditions , like any other procedures that create open cuts , whether by mohelim or medical professionals			0
' @entity123 , a certified mohel and physician in @entity31 who regularly practices circumcision procedures , said @entity37 look view the religion as ' more important than individuals '			1
' because blood is the life - giving element , they believe that it 's supposed to be part of the whole procedure , ' he said , adding that there were ' no known medical benefits '			1
an alternative to the practitioner removing the blood with their mouth is to use a sterilised glass tube or pipette to create the suction , which some @entity2 have started incorporating into the ritual			2
infectious diseases specialist dr. @entity146 defended the practice in a paper published in the @entity2 journal @entity150			0
he claimed there is no evidence that the ' metzitzah b'peh ' procedures caused the infant deaths			0
dr @entity155 also accused @entity31 government chiefs of ' racial bias ' .			2

two babies dead in @entity31 since 2004 after ritual
@entity37 believe the blood is ' life - giving element '
*critics* dismiss @entity167 practice as ' primitive nonsense '
