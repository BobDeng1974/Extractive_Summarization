by @entity0 a @entity2 bull terrier stolen more than five years ago has turned up 500 miles away in @entity3			1
@entity4 disappeared in 2009 after her owner tied her up for two minutes outside a newsagent in @entity7 , @entity8 - and despite a lengthy search she was not seen again			1
that was until last week , when the microchipped pet was finally reunited with her shocked 36 - year - old owner @entity12 after being found wandering the streets of @entity14 , @entity15			1
to ms @entity12 ' shock , a volunteer from the directory knocked on her door last week after the black staffie was taken in to @entity31 in @entity15			1
staff who tried to contact the pub worker discovered her mobile number had expired - but fortunately the volunteer lived just round the corner from her @entity8 home			2
ms @entity12 said : ' it was like losing a child			2
' you never lose hope completely , but i just wanted to know that she was okay and being looked after			0
' a lot of people made donations to get her down here			0
a woman from the kennels drove her from @entity3 to @entity48 and another woman drove her from @entity48 to @entity8			0

i was just so happy to have her back			0
' she added : ' i ’d like to say a special thanks to the kennels and to all the people involved in getting her home safely			0
' @entity60 , the kennels owner who made the drive to @entity48 , said : ' @entity4 was in excellent condition with excellent muscle tone and teeth			1
' there is no way of knowing where she has been for five years but she could have been taken to @entity3 from @entity8 and been kept as a pet for five years before escaping			2
' when we scanned her microchip the number for @entity12 was wrong so we went through the @entity25 records and found a mention of @entity4 , and @entity12 ’s old address was listed			1
