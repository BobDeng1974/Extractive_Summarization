by @entity0 a three - year - old girl was turned away from a holiday hotel children ’s club because she suffers from a form of dwarfism			1
the incident has been condemned by the girl ’s mother and campaigners as evidence of the prejudice that people born with the condition have to overcome			2
@entity15 was on holiday with her mum , @entity19 , and two older sisters , @entity21 , aged 17 , and @entity22 , 14 , at the @entity23 , in @entity24 , @entity25			1
@entity26 with her daughters @entity21 , 17 , right , @entity22 , 14 , and @entity28 , three			0
@entity29 , who suffers from a form of dwarfism , was told by staff at a @entity34 hotel she was not welcome to join the @entity35 the mother says she rang the holiday company before the family travelled to their destination to inform them of @entity28 's condition			1
she says the company assured her her daughter would be welcomed by the play group before going away mrs @entity44 contacted the holiday company , @entity45 , to explain that @entity28 had a form of dwarfism – achondroplasia – and had limited mobility because of her age and size			1
she specifically wanted to know that the children ’s club at the hotel would accept @entity28 and was given and assurance that it would			2
however , when the family arrived at the hotel , staff working in the club made clear that they saw @entity28 as a burden and that she would not be welcome to join in the fun and games			1
mrs @entity44 said the experience had been heart breaking , particularly when set against the achievements of people in the public eye who have dwarfism , such as the celebrated @entity72 swimmer , @entity73 , and the actor , @entity75			1
mr @entity75 is co-founder of the campaigning group @entity76 @entity77 , which support families where children are born with the condition			1
a spokesman for the group said : ‘ it is disheartening that in the 21st century , people with dwarfism are still being judged on what other people perceive they ca n't do , or by how they look			2
‘ bodies come in all shapes and sizes			0
there are over 200 different types of dwarfism , making up a population of over 6,000 people with the condition in the @entity77 today			1
@entity76 @entity77 , a charity founded by @entity75 , pictured , called the action ' disheartening ' today ‘ these individuals wish to be able to live happy and successful lives without facing the preconceptions of people who can not see beyond their height			1
it is unfortunate that many little people are teased and stared at throughout their lives because their bodies look different , to that of an average sized person			0
‘ eighty percent of people with dwarfism have average height parents and siblings			2
some types of dwarfism are simply a genetic change at conception , which happens to have very visible results			0
’ mrs @entity44 , a 43 - year - old single mum , from @entity116 , said her family had been looking forward to the holiday at the end of may			1
‘ it is quite tough for us			0
we had not been on holiday together as a family for a very long time and the girls were really keen to go away , ’ she said			2
‘ we spend a lot of time looking after @entity28 and we wanted a holiday where there was a kids club that would take three year olds to give her and everyone a break			1
after searching on the internet , we found this particular holiday and hotel with @entity45			2
‘ @entity28 is small and one aspect of her condition is that her muscle tone is not as well developed as other three year olds , which means she can walk a little but is not running around			0
’ mrs @entity44 , who gave up a plan to retrain as @entity144 teacher to look after @entity28 , said : ‘ i called @entity45 to make sure that the hotel and kids club would accept her			1
‘ i explained @entity28 had a form of dwarfism and had limited mobility			2
they assured me the hotel would have to accept @entity28 at the children ’s club and would make sure that they did			1
based on that assurance , i went ahead and booked			0
’ but mrs @entity44 said : ‘ when we got there and went to kids club with @entity28 in her buggy , the lady who was in charge said she ca n’t come in because she ca n’t walk			1
‘ she said she would not be able to do any of the activities , such as going for a picnic or to the beach			0
they said they did not have the staff to push @entity28 in her buggy			0
‘ naturally , i got quite upset and emotional on @entity28 ’s behalf , particularly as i have been assured they would take her			0
’ she explained that @entity28 goes to a nursery two days a week when she is at home and is used to spending time with other children and adults outside the immediate family			0
eventually , the staff relented and said she could attend some morning sessions , providing the family remained close by			2
the @entity23 , in @entity24 , @entity25 - where @entity35 staff made clear @entity28 was not welcome to join in with activities the mother says staff at the hotel ( pictured ) said @entity28 could n't join in as she could n't walk - despite the mother notifying them of her abilities before arrival ‘ we did go back , but the staff were immediately giving each other very funny looks and made it clear @entity28 was not welcome			1
the people were not taking much care of the children , so we just took her out			0
’ the situation was raised with the hotel ’s entertainments manager , who showed no concern or sympathy			0
‘ he was really rude to me in front of everybody			0
he said they could not accept a child like that , pointing at @entity28 , and said she would not be able to take part in any of the activities			0
‘ he said if @entity45 had bothered to call them he would have made clear they could not accept her			1
‘ this was all in front of @entity28 and she understands what is going on and she was going to be excluded			0
it was just horrid , and so upsetting			0
i really ca n’t understand why they would discriminate against a child like this			0
’ she complained to the @entity45 rep and again when the family returned home			0
initially , @entity45 claimed that mrs @entity44 did not fully explain @entity28 ’s condition , which she says is untrue and has added insult to injury			1
at first the travel company offered a good will gesture of £ 200 by way of an apology , but it later offered a full refund			0
‘ i feel very badly let down by @entity45			0
i explained the situation to them and i would not have booked unless i was given a clear assurance that @entity28 would be welcome , ’ she said the holiday company have now apologised to the family - and said they will review their booking systems @entity45 apologised and promised to review how it processes bookings			1
a spokesman said : ‘ @entity45 is sorry to hear about mrs @entity44 ’s disappointment with the kids ’ club at @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25			1
' @entity243 welcomes children with disabilities at all of its hotel - run kids ’ clubs			1
it plans its staffing levels very carefully to ensure that the correct ratio of children to staff is maintained at all times			0
a child with mobility issues will require one - to - one support , and therefore the kids ’ club must be informed in advance that the child wishes to attend			1
' when booking , mrs @entity44 advised us of her daughter ’s condition , but the agent did not appreciate that this can result in mobility issues			2
' had the agent been aware of this , she would have contacted the hotel to ensure they were prepared and adequately staffed to welcome her daughter			0
whilst @entity45 extensively trains its staff on how to take bookings from customers with special requirements , it is important that customers share as much information as possible so that we are able to provide the best holiday experience for them			2
' the team in resort did their utmost to ensure that mrs @entity44 ’s daughter was able to join in all appropriate activities , and as a result she attended part of the sessions every day that it operated during her holiday			2
' we sincerely apologise to mrs @entity44 and her family for the inconvenience caused , and have offered her a full refund which she has accepted			1
@entity243 welcomes thousands of children to its kids ’ clubs every year , with the vast majority of customers rating the staff as good or excellent			2

@entity44 suffers from a form of dwarfism called achondroplasia
mother @entity19 told @entity34 about her condition before holiday to @entity25
@entity305 assured her the child would be accepted in hotel kids club
but when family arrived , staff made it clear she would be a burden
