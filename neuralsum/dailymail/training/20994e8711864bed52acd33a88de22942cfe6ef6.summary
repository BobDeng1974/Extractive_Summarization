the rev. @entity0 is expected to hold a four - day tribute for the death of unarmed teenager @entity3 in @entity4 at the end of this month			1
@entity0 will be in the @entity7 town from october 31 to november 4 in reference to the four hours that the teenager 's body was left lying on the street			1
@entity0 is leading a wave of outcry after a friday report suggested that investigators do not have enough evidence to charge a police officer over the shooting of @entity3			1
experts told the paper that they believe investigators do not have the evidence to prosecute @entity23 on federal civil rights charges - meaning a grand jury could soon decide @entity23 should not be tried over the killing			1
in his own version of events , the police officer told a grand jury he opened fire because the teenager was attacking him and he feared for his life			1
@entity23 insists @entity3 viciously launched through the window of his police car , punching and scratching him repeatedly			1
police officers are generally given more scope for lethal force if they reasonably believe that their life is in imminent danger			1
eventually , @entity23 said , he pulled his gun from the holster on his right hip , fired two shots , and one hit @entity3 's arm - leaving his blood smeared inside the car and on his uniform			1
the account stops there and fails to explain why @entity3 was shot a further four times outside the vehicle			0
since no other witness had a clear vantage point from which to see the incident , legal experts warn @entity23 's testimony will carry significant weight for the grand jury , a legal expert told @entity79			1
slamming the account as illogical , @entity0 said at his @entity82 rally in @entity83 that it is the ' same excuse ' as all other shootings of black citizens by white men			2
' it sounds like a @entity90 defense , ' he said , referring to the @entity92 man who has been convicted of first - degree murder for shooting dead black teenager @entity94			1
@entity90 claimed he did it because @entity94 was playing music too loudly			0
' it did n't work in @entity92 and it should n't work in @entity7 , ' @entity0 added			0
he spluttered : ' first of all , if you stopped him - @entity3 and his friend - walking down the street , what led to the scuffle ? @entity0 is leading a wave of outcry after a friday report suggested that investigators do not have enough evidence to charge a the shooting of @entity3 aftermath : this is the first picture of @entity23 standing over @entity3 after shooting him dead claims : @entity23 , pictured again surveying the body , insists he fired from inside the car during a tussle but his account did not explain why the unarmed teenager was then shot at least four times outside the vehicle ' secondly , how does he and you get in your car ? you trying to do what by yourself ? ' @entity0 asked			1
' now , if i go with you with your story all the way to that - that @entity3 was shot , gets up off you in the car - why are you trying to tell me that a man ran back at you when he knew you had the gun and you already shot him ? ' he added : ' we were involved in @entity131			2
we were supportive of @entity94			0
' the strange thing is that all of them used the same excuse ... the only gun there was @entity23 's ! @entity138 parallels with all of these cases			2
' his words were echoed by @entity144 's grandson dr @entity143 who said wednesday ' we have looked at it only as racism , and racism is a byproduct of prejudice , ' @entity140 reported			0
' prejudice exists in every one of us , whether we are black , white , brown , yellow			0
' nonetheless , a jury will now have the power to tell the state attorney that @entity23 is innocent of civil rights abuses if they believe his claim that he was acting in self - defense			1
@entity159 , a professor at the @entity160 in @entity161 , told @entity79 the charge of civil rights abuse is a much higher standard than murder or manslaughter , as the 12 jury members will have to be certain @entity23 intended to violate @entity3 's civil rights by shooting him dead			1
' the civil rights abuses are even harder to prove than an underlying criminal conviction			0
the federal government does not step in to pursue a civil rights conviction unless they believe it was an intentional abuse			0
' there are some criminal charges that do n't involve that kind of mental state , like murder			0
they can be guilty of acting knowingly and recklessly , but it is different to intentionally violating a civil right			0
' as a result , he said , they will need forensic evidence of damage to the car to disprove @entity23 's account if they are to find him guilty			2
@entity193 law professor @entity192 told @entity79 an innocent verdict would ' totally undermine the @entity161 criminal justice system '			0
' if a grand jury accepts that every shot he fired at that kid was in self - defense that simply is not plausible , ' he said			1
but he warned that prosecutor @entity200 - who has been criticized for his strong ties with the police - will have a strong influence over their verdict			0
' pretty much every jury does what they are told			0
' if the prosecutor is being wishy washy about this , it is very possible a grand jury wo n't indict him			2
' determined to level charges against @entity23 regardless of the jury 's verdict , @entity212 , the @entity3 family 's lawyer , rebuffed the leaked account			1
' what the police say is not to be taken as gospel , ' mr. @entity212 told the @entity31			0
' he can say what he wants to say in front of a jury			0
they can listen to all the evidence and the people can have it transparent so they know that the system works for everybody			0
' the officer 's going to say whatever he 's going to say to justify killing an unarmed kid			2
' right now , they have this secret proceeding where nobody knows what 's happening and nobody knows what 's going on			0
' no matter what happened in the car , @entity3 ran away from him			0
' a number of witnesses agree that @entity3 and @entity23 were embroiled in a physical fight through the car window , but few had an accurate vantage point to see what was happening			2
' self defense ' : @entity4 police officer @entity23 says he feared for his life as he shot @entity3 they insist , however , the teenager was trying to flee and holding up his hands			1
one passer - by , @entity252 , is certain @entity3 was leaning away but @entity23 kept pulling him closer			1
another , @entity253 , said @entity23 grasped @entity3 's throat and then pulled out his gun threatening to shoot			1
they then heard shots fired from inside the suv			0
there remains no account from witnesses or police of the final four shots fired			0
according to @entity23 's description of the august 9 shooting - revealed for the first time today - @entity3 made him fear for his life			1
investigators are now examining the officer 's claim that the teenager physically assaulted him as a grand jury considers whether he is guilty of a number of crimes including : first - degree murder , second - degree murder , voluntary manslaughter or involuntary manslaughter			1
city officials claim there is still not enough evidence to charge @entity23 with violating civil rights			2
in september , officer @entity23 appeared before a @entity283 grand jury , which was convened to determine whether there is probable cause that he committed a crime			1
his willingness to testify surprised many			0
however , his account of feeling vulnerable will be a significant boost in his favor as the grand jury considers its verdict before the deadline of january 7			2
nine of the 12 jury members will have to vote against @entity23 in order for charges to be leveled			2
they are expected to vote by mid-november			0
@entity283 prosecuting attorney @entity200 could have bypassed the grand jury stage and simply taken the case to trial by filing a charge against @entity23			1
he could also have filed a complaint to a judge who decides if there should be a trial			0
however , @entity200 chose to take the full investigation of @entity23 's use of deadly force to the grand jury , leaving the 12 members to decide			1
according to the @entity31 , the leaked account of his version of events did not come from the @entity314 or from officials whose activities are being investigated as part of the civil rights inquiry			0
people claiming to have witnessed the shooting have given wildly different accounts of what happened			0
some have said that some the young man had his arms raised over his head while others claim that @entity23 shot him while his back was turned and he was running			0
the police have maintained that the unarmed teen physically assaulted the officer and tried to get his gun			2
one witness , whose name has been withheld , from @entity161 , @entity7 , told the grand jury that the teenager did not have his hands above his head when @entity23 shot at him , but rather ' out to his sides			1
' he also said @entity3 ' staggered toward @entity23 despite commands to stop ' and that ' the two were about 20 to 25 feet apart when the last shots were fired			2
' protests in @entity7 have continued ever since the shooting amid claims it was unjustified - and an extreme example of police brutality in the town			0
civil rights groups say @entity3 's death is part of a national epidemic in which a disproportionately high number of unarmed black men are fatally shot by white police officers , an allegation police deny			1
officials said that the evidence given so far did not support civil rights charges against officer @entity23			1
to press charges , the @entity360 would have to prove that he wilfully violated @entity3 's rights when he shot him .			2
