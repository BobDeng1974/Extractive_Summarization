shock : @entity8 ( left ) was waiting for an operation at @entity10 to change a kidney stent under general anaesthetic when a nurse checked with his wife @entity14 ( right ) whether the @entity16 order still stood guidelines from the @entity28 and the @entity29 both state that , in all cases , @entity16 orders should only be issued after discussion with patients or their family			1
she said : ‘ the whole thing is very bizarre and could have had terrible consequences			2
i ’m disgusted with what ’s happened			0
@entity8 is not going out of my sight			1
‘ he has his age against him and a heart condition - and if anything had happened they would just look at the form and leave him			0
‘ what happened is shrouded in mystery			0
it ’s not a situation that should just be put on the back burner because of the potential consequences for other people			0
’ a staff nurse alerted the family to the instructions , signed by a doctor when he was in hospital in november last year			1
@entity16 order : mrs @entity17 has made a formal complaint to @entity10 ( pictured ) and asked for a full investigation the form indicates the matter was agreed with his ‘ daughters ’ , but mr @entity8 ’s stepdaughter @entity66 said no such discussion had taken place			1
a man with @entity71 ’s syndrome took legal action against an @entity74 hospital after a ‘ do not resuscitate ’ order was allegedly put on his file without his family ’s knowledge			2
@entity79 reported in september 2012 how a note on the 51 - year - old ’s medical record said he should not be revived if he had a heart attack or stopped breathing , apparently on the basis of his disability			0
his family said they were not told about the @entity16 order , despite visiting him almost daily during his three - week stay at the queen elizabeth the queen @entity90 in @entity92 , @entity93			1
his horrified relatives only learned about the instruction when one of the man ’s carers found it folded up in his bag after he was discharged			0
lawyers for the man , identified only as @entity103 , said the choice to withhold life - saving treatment on the basis of his learning difficulties was ‘ nothing short of blatant prejudice ’			0
@entity111 has not yet commented on the case ’s progression , and has been contacted today			0
mrs @entity17 said : ‘ my daughter went into shock			1
she is not aware of it			0
@entity8 is her stepdad and she is heartbroken			2
‘ she said “ what would have happened if anything had happened to him ? would you ever have forgiven me ? ” ’ the nurse brought the surgeon into the ward to officially rescind the order before the surgery			2
but now they want answers to the alleged lack of proper communication which could have cost the life of mr @entity8 , who has prostate cancer and is in the early stages of dementia			2
dr @entity133 , spokesman for @entity134 , said : ‘ we were concerned to hear mrs @entity17 ’s account			1
‘ mrs @entity17 has been in contact with us and we are continuing to work with her to provide answers to the issues she has raised regarding her husband ’s time in hospital			1
‘ the hospital has very clear guidance around good practice when making decisions about resuscitation			2
' so fundamental is this that we audit regularly our clinical teams ’ performance in this area			0
' the guidance includes discussion with patients and their families			0
' the form used in the @entity134 and across the region is partly a record of that discussion and reflects both the appropriateness of attempted resuscitation and the wishes of our patient and their loved ones			0
