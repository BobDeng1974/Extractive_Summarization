by @entity0 you had one job , ground crew			1
staff at @entity6 's yankee stadium tussled with a storm cover for 13 minutes - leaving the infield so drenched that a win had to be declared for the home team			1
@entity11 hit last night when the @entity12 were leading 2 - 1 in their fifth innings against the @entity14 , and the protective tarp should have taken 60 seconds to roll out			1
as fans fled the torrential rain , chaos ensued as the ground crew first folded the tarp back over itself , then called for reinforcements			1
minutes ticked by as they pulled at the sides of the gigantic cover , but it was in vain - it just would n't budge			0
almost instantly the loose dirt in the stadium had turned to mud , splashing up onto the legs of the dejected crew and sucking down the tarp even harder			2
commentators observed how crews practice bringing on the tarp time and time again to get it right , but what they were left with was a ' mess '			0
dejected : a member of the ground staff pulls in vain at the giant sheet			0
eventually the ball boys got involved chaos : most fans did n't stick around to see the sodden crew struggle with the tarp , as they were soaked too eventually more than 25 people including ball boys heaved the heavy sheet over the infield , with some of them clambering underneath to prevent it getting stuck to the ground			2
an ironic cheer went up around the 50,000 - capacity baseball stadium as the @entity12 themselves looked on from the dugout , bemused			1
it did not escape anyone 's notice that the umpires then had to declare @entity12 the winner - because the infield was so wet they could not continue playing			1
fans on @entity80 accused the crew of sabotaging the game deliberately to secure a win for the @entity12 , who lost 4 - 2 in a game on tuesday which included rookie errors by pitcher @entity87			1
@ _ rallycap tweeted : ' a tarp has helped the @entity12 more than @entity90 this year			0
' soaked : the @entity12 ' @entity91 , who had been on second base , runs off the field as the rain hits and @entity80 user @entity95 simply wrote : ' the @entity12 sabotaged the pulling of the tarp and let the rain ruin the field for the victory			2
' when journalists asked @entity14 manager @entity102 to comment on the claim , he replied : ' i ’m not going to answer that one , man , ' @entity105 reported			0
but he added : ' those guys have been doing that for a long time and i do n’t think it was intentional			0
but usually when they start pulling the tarp it makes it			0
that one did n’t make it			0

team in fifth innings against @entity119 when storm lashed @entity6 stadium
a dozen @entity12 ground crew members *rushed* to roll out giant tarpaulin
but within the few seconds it took to unroll , it became too weighed down
@entity129 ensued , tarp was *refolded* , and entire process took 13 minutes
the @entity12 , who were leading 2 - 1 , then won - because field was too wet
