by @entity0 , political correspondent low - fat diets do not curb heart disease or help you live longer – the real enemy is sugar and carbohydrates , according to a leading scientist			1
current dietary advice is based on flawed evidence from the 1950s that has demonised saturated fat and put public health at risk , he said			1
@entity15 , a cardiovascular research scientist in @entity17 , said : ‘ we need a public health campaign as strong as the one we had in the 70s and 80s demonising saturated fats , to say that we got it wrong			1
’ leading scientist @entity15 says low - fat diets do not curb heart disease or help people live longer ¿ the real enemy is sugar and carbohydrates writing in the journal @entity27 , he added : ‘ there is no conclusive proof that a low - fat diet has any positive effects on health			1
indeed , the literature indicates a general lack of any effect ( good or bad ) from a reduction in fat intake			0
‘ the public fear that saturated fat raises cholesterol is completely unfounded			0
’ experts believed the low - fat diet would lead to less obesity and diabetes – when the exact opposite was true , he added			2
evidence shows a low - carbohydrate diet – as opposed to a low - fat diet – actually improves cholesterol			2
however , he believed that processed foods should still be avoided			0
@entity51 experts last year claimed that faulty interpretation of scientific studies had perpetuated a myth that a high - fat diet is bad for the heart			1
people were advised to reduce fat intake to 30 per cent of total energy and saturated fat intake to 10 per cent			0
however , research now fails to show a link between saturated fat intake and risk of cardiovascular disease , with saturated fat actually found to be protective			2
@entity66 has become the first western nation to develop dietary guidelines rejecting the low - fat myth , in favour of low - carb , high - fat nutrition advice			1
professor @entity73 , of @entity74 says people should choose foods containing unsaturated oils such as fish and nuts dr @entity80 said : ‘ from these data , it is easy to comprehend that the global epidemic of atherosclerosis , heart disease , diabetes , obesity and the metabolic syndrome is being driven by a diet high in carbohydrate / sugar as opposed to fat , a revelation that we are just starting to accept			2
’ the best diet to boost and maintain heart health is one low in refined carbohydrates , sugars and processed foods , he said			0
@entity100 , professor of nutrition at @entity102 , @entity103 , agreed that the evidence failed to support advice to cut fat and saturated fat			2
‘ many who adhere to dietary dogma have chosen to ignore the uncomfortable facts that did not fit the hypothesis ’ he said			0
but professor @entity73 , head of diabetes and nutritional sciences division in the @entity113 at @entity74 , said dr @entity80 had misrepresented the scientific evidence			0
‘ refocusing dietary advice on sugar and away from fat modification and reduction is not helpful , ’ he said			0
prof @entity73 , who advises the industry - backed @entity119 , said : ‘ dietary advice to avoid fatty meat products , choose reduced - fat dairy produce , and to restrict intakes of cakes , biscuits and puddings , which are often both high in saturated fat and sugar , and to select foods containing unsaturated oils such as nuts , fish and vegetable oils remain good sense			1
those who fail to learn the lessons of history are likely to repeat its errors			0
’ @entity140 , director of nutrition and diet at @entity143 , said : ‘ it is reasonable to conclude that a reduction in saturated fat intake will lower blood cholesterol , which may reduce the risk of developing heart disease			1
