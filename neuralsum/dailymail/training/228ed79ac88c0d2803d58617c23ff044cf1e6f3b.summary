almost three weeks after the summer transfer window closed , the @entity2 table is showing significant signs that clubs do not need to be big net spenders to improve their teams			1
or net spenders at all , in fact			2
of the six lowest net spenders among the 20 clubs during the window , it is extraordinary to note that five them are currently sitting within the top six places in the table			1
the six lowest net spenders were : @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 , who made respective net profits of £ 30.7m , £ 6.5m and £ 0.8m from their summer trading , and @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 , who respectively had net spend of just £ 0.4m , £ 1.3m and £ 5.9m			1
@entity18 bought @entity27 for £ 32m but made a net profit and are top of the @entity2 @entity17 were another side to make a net profit in a summer in which they signed defender @entity33 the @entity2 's net spenders table , with @entity16 at the top and @entity36 at the bottom these are early days in the season , with just four games played in the @entity2 so far			1
but net earners @entity18 are top with a 100 per cent cent record , followed by unbeaten @entity24 , then @entity23 and @entity16 in the @entity43 berths , with @entity17 in sixth			1
the @entity2 table shows five of the most prudent spenders in the early top six this is not to say that massive net spending wo n’t pay dividends in time			1
@entity36 spent a net sum of £ 122m on players including @entity52 star @entity51 , a @entity54 record buy at £ 60m			2
@entity56 ’s new - look side already look a different proposition after his spree			0
@entity60 , with £ 46.4m net spend , are also in the top 10 in the table and strongly fancied to finish in the top four yet again , while @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 ( with respective net spend of £ 35.7m , £ 32.8m and £ 32m ) all aspire to @entity43 football next season , too			0
yet the early lesson from the window is it ’s not how much cash you can splash that matters , but how it is spent			0
@entity18 offloaded @entity74 and @entity75 for large sums , as well as @entity77 and @entity78 but crucial was the reinvestment in @entity27 ( top scorer in the league so far with seven goals in four games ) , @entity84 and @entity85 among others			2
@entity16 ’s sale of @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 prompted suggestions of meltdown and relegation			0
but among their replacements , @entity97 is joint second - highest scorer in the league this season , @entity96 is one of the most impressive early - season goalkeepers and @entity103 is showing signs he could excel as an orchestrator in place of @entity89			0
and @entity16 made more than £ 30m profit			2
@entity36 are bottom of the net spend table - which is unsurprising given that they spent more than £ 150m in the summer , including the £ 60m @entity54 record signing of @entity51 @entity112 was @entity60 's big buy of the summer and contributed to their net loss @entity63 spent £ 16m on @entity115 as they splurged following the sale of @entity117 @entity23 under @entity118 are also performing above expectation , after a net spend of £ 1.3m , or equivalent to less than one quarter of @entity123 ’s one - year loan fee at @entity36			1
that £ 1.3m is also approximately one - tenth of what @entity36 will spend on the @entity127 star ’s wages alone this season			0
@entity17 ’s trading left them in the profit , meanwhile , something @entity132 may not have envisaged when he jumped ship from @entity16			1
then again his remit is to make @entity17 more than the sum of their parts , not spend a load of money			0
the same is true at @entity24 , where a modest net outlay has been no hindrance to a good start , so far .			0

@entity16 top of net spenders table and fourth in @entity2
@entity18 , surprisingly , made a profit in summer and top the league
@entity36 are bottom of the net spenders table
@entity17 second in terms of prudence and *sneak* into @entity2 top six
