by @entity0 published : 06:54 est , 9 january 2014 updated : 09:01 est , 9 january 2014 a former paratrooper has paid back £ 5 he borrowed from a friend 50 years ago - with £ 170 interest			1
@entity5 lost touch with @entity7 after they left the armed forces - but he never forgot the money 74 - year - old mr @entity7 lent him in 1964 , and paid up as soon as they made contact again			1
and to make amends mr @entity5 , 73 , of @entity13 , @entity14 , sent his old friend - a great - grandfather of four from @entity16 , @entity17 , a cheque for more than £ 170 - calculated at 7 per cent annual interest			1
happy : @entity7 and his wife @entity20 with the cheque for £ 175 they were sent in payment of a £ 5 debt it arrived in a @entity27 card with the note : ‘ please accept the enclosed £ 5 at 7 per cent compound interest over 51 years in the spirit in which it is offered			1
have a nice meal on your interest			2
’ mr @entity7 , who also has 12 grandchildren , said : ‘ it was such a nice shock			1
i ’m pleased @entity37 has now salved his conscience , as he told me that it often played on his mind			0
’ the two men met in 1958 when they both served with the @entity42 of the @entity43			0
the pair served in @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 , where their aircraft was blown up on the runway by angry locals and their soup poisoned by a rogue chef			0
they lost contact in 1964 and mr @entity5 moved to @entity13 , where he has lived ever since			1
but they got back in touch last year			2
' have a nice meal ' : mr @entity5 sent the cheque for more than £ 170 in a @entity27 card with this note the former comrades only made contact when the @entity66 decided to look mr @entity5 up when they were on holiday in @entity68 , @entity69 , last year - as they knew he had once lived there			1
mr @entity7 said : ‘ we found the address for a @entity5 and we went to see him			1
we asked if he knew @entity71 , and he told us it was his brother			0
‘ he gave me quite a scare because he said we were 40 years too late			0
we thought he had died ! but it turned out he had moved away many years ago			0
’ after inviting them in , mr @entity5 's brother , @entity75 , immediately spoke @entity71 via @entity77 in @entity13 , to tell him his old friend had come to visit			2
mr @entity7 said : ‘ he came on the phone and the first words he said to me were “ i still owe you a fiver ”			2
i had no memory of it			0
’ then and now : mr @entity7 ( left in left photo ) and mr @entity5 ( right in left ) pictured during their time serving in the @entity42 of the @entity43			1
mr @entity5 is also pictured now ( right ) mr @entity5 said he had needed to borrow the money because he was ‘ absolutely skint ’			2
he said : ‘ @entity91 was flush with funds which i suspect could only have been amassed from a game of poker or a successful visit to the @entity97 greyhounds			0
‘ as our pay at the time was four pound ten shillings plus an extra eight shillings a week for jumping out of planes , you can imagine what the ten pounds he lent me meant at the time			0
’ ‘ i managed to repay @entity91 half of what i owed him in 1964 , leaving a fiver to be repaid at a later date			2
@entity110 marched on and as often happens between good mates we lost touch with each other			1
‘ we have stayed in touch since and i am looking forward to shaking his hand when i visit him and his wife later this month whilst on my way to @entity121			0
‘ the idea of facing him still owing him a fiver was too embarrassing , so i decided to repay him with interest before i arrived in @entity126			0
’ going up : the cheque was sent from @entity14 for more than £ 170 - calculated at 7 per cent annual interest in his @entity27 card to mr @entity7 , mr @entity5 also wrote : ‘ when i left for @entity121 in 1962 i owed you £ 10			1
i repaid a fiver when i saw you in @entity132 in 1964 on my way to @entity134 for the @entity135			0
’ mr @entity7 says he will spend his interest on a meal for the pair at the @entity139 in @entity17			1
' please accept the enclosed £ 5 at 7 per cent compound interest over 51 years in the spirit in which it is offered			1
have a nice meal on your interest ' @entity147 's note he added : ‘ i 'm really looking forward to seeing him			1
it is an exciting time			0
it will probably be the one and only time we see each other again			0
the cheque was a by - product really , the best thing is that we 're now back in touch			1
’ mr @entity5 , who has lived in @entity13 since 1973 , added that he had always felt guilty about the debt			2
he said : ‘ many is the time i woke worrying about owing a good mate a loan given without hesitation when i most needed it			0
‘ imagine my surprise when i worked out that £ 5 at compound interest over the time meant i had to repay @entity91 one hundred and seventy pounds and seventy five pence			2
‘ i suppose the moral of the story is , do n’t wait 50 years to repay an old mate a fiver			0

@entity147 lost touch with @entity7 after they left the armed forces
but he *remembered* 1964 loan and paid up when they got back in touch
@entity5 sent cheque for more than £ 170 , calculated at 7 *%* annual interest
