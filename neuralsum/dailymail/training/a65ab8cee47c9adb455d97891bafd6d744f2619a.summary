it may fall under the category of ' reality television ' , but there is apparently very little that 's authentic about breaking @entity5			2
after just two episodes , the @entity7 show has come under fire for deceiving viewers about the five @entity5 and @entity12 men and women it follows as they visit @entity15 for the first time			1
while each cast member claims to have grown up in the strict communities , evidence has surfaced suggesting they have decidedly dark pasts - involving divorce , children and time away from the faith			2
it comes in stark contrast to the naive characters portrayed on the show , who stare slack - jawed at @entity31 's towering buildings and pray as they travel by plane ' for the first time '			2
as revealed on a @entity51 page , @entity49 , she has previously submitted images to modeling agencies - which is at odds with the @entity5 stance against photographs , believing they represent ' vanity ' which they deem a sin			1
online records show that @entity42 posted a photograph on @entity62 to enter a @entity63 in 2010 - years before she claimed she gave up her @entity5 life to move to the city			1
this internet savvy version of @entity42 is a far cry from an episode of @entity37 in which she is overwhelmed by new technology and struggles to work an elevator			0
dark pasts : @entity7 had previously admitted that @entity42 , pictured left on the show , was arrested for @entity46 , right aspiring model : a photo of @entity42 has been found online from a smiling contest in 2010 questions : this is at odds with the persona she portrays on the show			1
here , she struggles to work a lift two other cast members , @entity85 and @entity86 , are portrayed as meeting for the first time on the show - with a possible love match on the cards			1
but a photograph apparently shows that the pair in fact already have a child together			0
and while @entity86 claims in the program that he has never partied , police records - and a mug shot - reveal he was arrested for alcohol intoxication in a public place in 2008 , when he was just 18			2
@entity100 , another cast member , was reportedly away from his @entity5 community for up to 14 years and is pictured on social networking sites surrounded by beer cans			1
public records also reveal that 32 - year - old @entity100 , who regularly swears on the show , is divorced and has three children - two daughters , aged seven and three , and a son , five			1
' false claims ' : on the show , @entity85 and @entity86 , pictured , claim they have never met before secret : a photograph on @entity51 apparently shows two more cast members , @entity85 and @entity86 , with their baby - even though they ' meet for the first time ' on the show nerves : on the show , @entity85 is seen praying as she takes the flight to @entity15 the children live with their mother in @entity122			1
the couple married in 2005 and she filed for divorce in 2011 , citing gross neglect of duty and incompatibility			0
brush with the law : a mug shot of @entity86 from 2008 after he was arrested for being drunk in public ' i 've known him for years , ' said @entity132 , who claims he lived with @entity100 for a year and a half			1
' i let him move in because he was living out of his truck and had no place else to go			0
' in the show , he is seen leaving his girlfriend for @entity15 but it is rare for @entity5 people to divorce so @entity100 would unlikely have been accepted back into the community and have started a new relationship			1
the final character , @entity143 , a 25 - year - old from an @entity145 and @entity146 family who was adopted into the faith , is pictured on @entity51 kissing a man while she wears skimpy clothing			1
she was reportedly married in 2009 and has not been a practicing @entity12 for years , friends claim , suggesting this is not the ' first time ' she has left the community			0
the apparent betrayal by the creators of @entity37 is documented on a @entity51 page , breaking @entity158 , on which people who claim to know the cast have vented their anger			0
scores of people have also uploaded photographs showing the cast in their ' real ' lives			0
@entity167 , a former @entity5 who appeared on a separate show , @entity170 , lambasted the show for its dishonesty			0
on the show : @entity100 says he is desperate to break away from his @entity5 community on the show - but has reportedly already spent 14 years away past : photographs from an old @entity178 page show @entity100 looking decidedly un-amish wild : pictures also show @entity100 , left , surrounded by friends swigging from beer cans ' this show is doing exactly opposite of what i stand for , ' he wrote on his blog			1
' the fakeness of these characters supposedly just leaving the community , when in fact , they have been out for many years			0
' the fact that they act like things like microwaves and iphones are something strange , when indeed , they have owned them for years themselves , and the disrespect they show towards the @entity5			2
' i would never stoop to doing a show like this , and really wish no one else would have done it either			0
' in response to the outrage , @entity7 has said it will address the revelations in time			0
' there is a lot of information floating around about the group featured on @entity37			0
much of it is not true , but some of it is - and is addressed in upcoming episodes , ' @entity7 told @entity214			2
' our @entity5 and @entity12 producers that we hired introduced us to @entity5 and @entity12 men and women who were already determined to leave			0
they had already made the decision to go out and see the world , with or without us			0
they courageously allowed us to follow them on this journey			0
' half truths : @entity143 , a @entity12 , was reportedly married in 2009 - which is not mentioned on the show double life : but @entity51 photos apparently show her kissing a man and wearing skimpy clothes bewildered : on the show , the cast members are portrayed as naive and fearful of @entity15 despite these protestations , @entity7 has adjusted the description of the show on its website			1
it was previously billed as ' four @entity5 and one @entity12 , breaking away from their faith and traveling to @entity15 for the first time '			2
now the @entity7 site explains : ' @entity37 offers an unprecedented look into a rarely seen world , following four @entity5 people and one @entity12 as they forgo horses and buggies for @entity15 's taxis and subways ' - taking out any reference to ' first time ' in @entity15			1

doubts over honesty of show following lives of @entity5 in @entity15
two cast members , @entity86 and @entity85 , ' have a child together '
@entity42 ' submitted photos to modeling sites - even though she is portrayed as a *technophobe* and taking photos is against @entity5 beliefs '
@entity100 ' was out of the community for 14 years , is divorced with three kids '
@entity143 ' is married and pictured wearing skimpy clothing '
@entity7 : ' some of the claims are true , some are not , but they will be addressed '
