by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:28 est , 15 september 2013 updated : 05:42 est , 16 september 2013 @entity4 plans to force all visitors to the @entity6 to pay a £ 3,000 bond will be blocked by the @entity8 , @entity2 vowed today			1
the deputy prime minister vowed to jettison @entity11 ’s push to ‘ clobber ’ tens of thousands of visitors from @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 before they are allowed to enter @entity6			2
and in further signs of a coalition rift over immigration , mr @entity2 dismissed the ‘ silly ’ ad vans warning illegal immigrants in @entity24 to ‘ go home ’ and insisted they would not be rolled out across nationwide			1
division : @entity2 sought to distance himself from his @entity4 coalition partners , attacking @entity28 plans for a £ 3,000 bond for all visitors to the @entity6 mr @entity2 has ordered his party to use their annual conference in @entity33 to launch a series of attacks on their conservative coalition partners			1
after attacking a @entity4 idea to allow firms to fire staff at will , he today claimed the @entity4 would not ensure the economic recovery was ‘ fair ’ if left to run the country alone			0
other rifts also emerged over wind power and welfare cuts			2
it comes as a poll shows @entity8 party members want to forge a power - sharing deal with @entity49 next time round			1
mr @entity2 denied holding secret talks with either party ahead of the 2015 election			1
controversy : investigation : the @entity28 's ' @entity56 ' vans were ' silly ' and should not be used nationwide , mr @entity2 said @entity2 tried to play down suggestions that he favoured a new coalition with the @entity4 - but then saved his biggest economic criticism for @entity49			1
the @entity8 leader is under pressure from party members to forge a power - sharing deal with @entity49 after the next election			1
the @entity65 on sunday published a poll conducted by the website @entity67 , which found that 39 per cent of activists questioned would prefer a @entity58 after 2015 , compared with just 15 per cent who favour another coalition with the conservatives			2
but challenged over the role the @entity8 would play working with either party , mr @entity2 claimed @entity49 left to run the country alone would ' wreck ' the economy			1
but he suggested only that the @entity4 would not be fair			0
he told @entity79 's @entity78 programme : ' it is my genuine belief that if you go back to the bad old days , not of coalition and balanced politics , but either the left or the right dominating government on their own , you will get a recovery that is neither fair nor sustainable			0
' i think @entity49 would wreck the recovery , and under the conservatives , who do n’t have the same commitment to fairness that we do , you ’d get the wrong kind of recovery			2
' so our message is : coalition is good ; what the @entity8 have done in government is good			2
let us finish the job , but let us finish it fairly			0
' but he turned his fire on the @entity92 , vowing to use his power to block tough immigration policies			0
home secretary mrs may says she wants to make the immigration system more ‘ selective ’ and deter people from ‘ overstaying ’ once their visitor visa has expired			1
in the long - term , she hopes to extend an @entity117 - style £ 3,000 bond scheme to also include foreign workers and students but they have become bogged down in coalition wrangling			0
asked if he would block the idea , mr @entity2 told @entity124 ’s @entity78 programme : ‘ of course , of course			1
in a coalition i can stop things			0
‘ i am absolutely not interested in a bond which becomes an indiscriminate way of clobbering people who want to come to this country and in many respects bring great prosperity and benefits to this country			0
‘ but on immigration let me be clear			0
clearly to create a tolerant society people need to have confidence in the way in which the immigration system is run			0
‘ that ’s why i have been outspoken in my view , not just in this coalition government but before we were elected that we have introduce exit checks for instance			0
‘ but we must at the same time say that an open economy such as ours open to the world has to be welcoming to those who want to come here			0
‘ they are certainty not going to go ahead on the basis of an indiscriminate bond being applied to all visitors to this country			0
’ the @entity8 leader said he was willing to support a targeted bond ‘ as an extra discretionary tool for customs officers so where they have doubts about whether people are going to return to their home country ’			1
he added : ‘ i think one way or another we need to give the public the confidence that if you give someone a visa and say you can be here for five years , two years , three years that is what it means			0
‘ otherwise what ’s the point of issuing those kind of visas ? ’ the @entity28 has also sent vans displaying billboards warning overstaying migrants ‘ go home , or you 'll be picked up and deported ’ to tour six @entity24 boroughs in july			0
@entity4 ministers have made clear their desire to send the vans across the country			0
but mr @entity2 insisted he would also block that a nationwide campaign : ‘ i thought they were a very silly idea , and i said so at the time			1
‘ i do n’t think you inspire public confidence by aimlessly drifting around in vans in @entity24 saying by the way can you go home please			0
’ the splits on immigration come after the deputy prime minister last night denounced ' bizarre ' @entity4 ideas about employment rights and said only the @entity8 could speak credibly about creating and defending jobs			1
mr @entity2 pleaded with his party to unite behind him , as @entity204 made fresh calls for the @entity8 leader to quit			1
clash : @entity207 mp @entity204 said it was ' nothing personal ' but @entity2 has to quit as @entity8 leader writing for @entity1 , ex-mp mr @entity204 warned that without a new leader the @entity8 faced ‘ destruction ’			1
in a damning assessment of the deputy prime minister ’s performance , mr @entity204 claims that if the party were a business ‘ he ’d have been fired a long ago ’			2
the searing criticism from one of the @entity8 ’ best known figures comes after peer @entity221 warned the @entity8 could be reduced to just 20 seats at the next election and called for mr @entity2 to quit			1
with the party stubbornly stuck at around 10 per cent in the polls , behind @entity227 , there are fears many @entity229 will be lost at the 2015 election			0
mr @entity204 , who has called for a new leader before , warns the party will be lucky to retain half of its 57 seats with mr @entity2 in charge			1
he writes : ‘ i ’ve got nothing against @entity2 personally			2
‘ and the truth is , if the @entity8 were a business , he ’d have been fired a long ago			2
‘ no ‘ chief executive officer ’ could survive such terrible performance indicators : a catastrophic decline in membership , a virtual halving of local councillors , a dreadful deposit - losing @entity24 mayoral result and the worst poll ratings in over two decades			0
’ damning : @entity249 says it is a ' myth ' that taxing high value property could be a source of income for the government @entity2 stepped up calls for higher taxes on the wealthy , as he signalled soaking the rich will be a key demand of the @entity8 at the next election			1
he said the party 's commitment to a mansion tax on properties over £ 2 million , raising £ 2 billion , sent a signal that ' even though we are committed to deficit reduction ' that would not be achieved entirely through spending cuts			1
he told the @entity79 : ' taxes and particularly taxes on people who can afford it , have to play some role in the ongoing effort to making sure that we complete the job of filling the black hole in the public finances			0
' if the @entity92 do n't want to do that then they need to tell people , and that 's part of the debate we will have to have over the next year - and - a - half , what they will cut - schools or hospitals or pensions or police or the armed services - to make up that £ 2 billion			0
' however mr @entity2 's plans for a ‘ mansion tax ’ have been savaged by @entity249 – former wife of disgraced @entity8 mp @entity293			1
ms @entity249 says it is a ‘ myth ’ that taxing homes worth more than £ 2 million will be a ‘ magic source of income ’ for the government			2
ms @entity249 , who will attend the @entity8 conference in @entity33 , dismisses the whole idea of a mansion tax , which has been blocked by the conservatives			1
in an article for today ’s @entity304 , she says : ‘ it is a tax that is set at an arbitrary level with no economic justification for that level or the rate imposed – except to raise a certain amount of money ’ and ‘ a mantra for those who feel there is a hidden reservoir of taxes just waiting to be tapped ’			2
ms @entity249 also pointedly disagrees with her friend @entity317 , the business secretary , who has raised fears that @entity319 plans for low - deposit mortgages could lead to a new house price bubble			2
‘ there are concerns over a housing market bubble – expressed by @entity317 no less – but i do n’t share them , ’ she says .			0
