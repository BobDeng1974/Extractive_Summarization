criticism : viewers have complained to @entity2 about the @entity3 , hosted by @entity4 , with some calling for it to be scrapped because of bad language viewers could have been excused for expecting an evening of jollity from the country ’s sharpest wits			1
but instead , @entity10 ’s @entity3 descended into alcohol - fuelled profanity from the likes of @entity4			2
the two - hour broadcast was described as a ‘ car crash ’ after a series of comics slurred their way through rambling , expletive - laden speeches			0
the programme , which also suffered from technical problems , prompted a stream of invective from the audience online , and more than 50 official complaints to the broadcaster and its watchdog , @entity2			2
many took particular offence at @entity4 ’s performance as host , with some branding it embarrassing			2
others noted that stars including @entity36 and @entity37 appeared to be drunk			2
guests at the event in north @entity40 were plied with free wine , cider and beer for an hour before the broadcast began at 9pm			0
@entity45 and @entity47 actor @entity46 could be seen crawling on the floor and giggling while the show took place			0
inevitably , many of the lowlights involved 53 - year - old @entity4 , who first presented the annual ceremony in 1991			2
in one tasteless sketch , he and @entity54 , who was named best male tv comic , joked about the infamous @entity58 affair that led to @entity4 ’s suspension from the @entity60			1
with a mask strapped to his face , the presenter pretended to be a ventriloquist ’s dummy while @entity54 made him issue a mock apology for the incident in 2008 , when he and @entity68 left foul - mouthed messages on @entity72 star @entity71 ’s answerphone			1
when @entity54 , as @entity4 , began the skit with ‘ hello @entity74 ’ , @entity4 responded : ‘ oh f * * * off ’			1
i ’ve never had the confidence to say but i ’ll say it now , what i did was bang out of order			0
’ @entity54 then made @entity4 offer his resignation to @entity92 , where he now hosts a chat show following his departure from the @entity60 , before adding : ‘ once again , @entity74 , i ’m sorry			1
’ in another shocking segment , gay comedian @entity36 told x factor judge @entity96 that he wanted to ‘ do a reverse @entity102 ’ and ‘ f * * * your brains out ’ , referring to the @entity100 diver ’s recent admission that he is dating a man			1
@entity107 , the director of campaign group @entity108 , branded the night ’s swearing ‘ pointless and unfunny ’ and criticised @entity10 for allowing it to appear uncensored			0
controversial : @entity36 ( left ) told @entity96 he wanted to ' sh - f * * * ' her when she collected an award passionate : the thrilled comedian also kissed the host on the lips and admitted he 'd ' had a drink ' slight : @entity37 took a swipe at @entity119 in his speech and said his comedy was based on poking fun at ' victims ' response : @entity119 , who was not at the ceremony last night , responded to @entity37 ' comments online today she said : ‘ it ’s a bit sad that a ceremony that is meant to be rewarding the wittiest comedy should resort to the lowest common denominator by replacing jokes with swear - words			1
‘ it was n’t clever and it was n’t witty			0
you ca n’t get away with using that kind of language in your workplace , in a shop , or at school			0
so why should people think it ’s acceptable on tv ? ’ one upset viewer wrote online : ‘ why all the unnecessary swearing ? did n’t make them funny , just desperate			0
’ another added : ‘ @entity4 is excruciatingly unfunny			0
you can tell everyone in the room is embarrassed for him			0
’ the programme overran after a bizarre rant from @entity37 , who complained that ‘ there are people in the room we do n’t think should have won ’ , adding : ‘ i won an award about nine years ago and have n’t won f * * * * * * anything since			1
’ as a result , the final speech of the night from @entity163 , accepting an outstanding achievement award , was cut short to broadcast a repeat of the reality show @entity167			0
this appeared to be @entity4 ’s biggest regret of the night , for he later posted on @entity84 : ‘ hope you enjoyed the @entity3			0
@entity10 are f * * * * * * idiots for cutting @entity163 ’s speech off for a repeat			1
’ mistake : @entity163 collects his award at the end of the show but his speech was cut short , which led to @entity4 calling them ' f * * * * * * idiots ' football fan : @entity182 yelled ' @entity183 ' , a reference to his beloved @entity185 , which has been banned amid concerns it incites racial hatred crocodile tears : at one point , @entity190 had an faux emotional moment as he accepted his @entity195 award some 40 viewers complained to @entity10 about the programme while another ten have contacted @entity2 , which must now decide whether to investigate further			1
a @entity10 spokesman said : ‘ the @entity3 is an established live event and is well - known for its raucous nature and edgy humour			1
the programme was preceded with a warning that the humour was of an adult nature and contained very strong language			1
’ they added : ‘ unfortunately , due to a transmission error the end of @entity163 ’s speech was unintentionally cut off			0
’ outstanding @entity211 - @entity212 - @entity213 - would i lie to @entity216 @entity215 & @entity217 - getting on @entity219 - @entity36 ( @entity36 's @entity218 ) @entity221 - @entity220 ( @entity222 ) best tv comedy actor - @entity223 ( @entity225 ) best tv comedy actress - @entity226 ( @entity226 ) @entity229 - @entity228 ( @entity230 ) @entity231 ( would i lie to you ) @entity234 - @entity233 @entity235 2013 - @entity223			2

viewers call for annual event to be scrapped and call it worst in *history*
@entity2 confirm they have received complaints , mainly about bad language
@entity36 told @entity96 : ' i want to sh - f * * * your sh - brains out '
@entity54 *dragged* up ' @entity58 ' and forces @entity4 to apologise
using ventriloquist 's mask he said : ' @entity71 , i ’m so sorry for being a c * * * '
@entity4 later turned on @entity10 and called them ' f * * * * * * idiots ' after show
@entity37 takes pot - shot at @entity119 for his brand of comedy
office star responds : ' please do *n't* criticise my multi award winning , half a *billion* *dollar* *franchise* , *global* hit show . it really hurts '
@entity182 yells ' *yid* army ' - a @entity185 reference police consider *anti-semitic*

' @entity277 preceded with warning that the humour was of an adult nature '
