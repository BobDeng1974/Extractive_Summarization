by @entity0 a revolutionary slip - on plastic coated hoof that doubles as an equine fashion accessory could spell the end for nailing on horseshoes			1
an equestrian designer came up with the ' @entity7 ' , which uses a traditional metal horseshoe that is coated in a durable thick plastic covering and glued to the animal 's foot rather than nailed			1
the coating offers the horse more cushioning and offers an easier alternative to the traditional method of fitting shoes			2
revolutionary : designer @entity18 with his new plastic coated horseshoe , pictured with @entity21 , and her owner @entity22 at her stable in @entity24 , @entity25 comfortable : the horseshoe uses a traditional metal shoe but that is coated in a softer plastic but not only are they easier to fit and more comfortable for the horse , the shoes could become something of an equine fashion accessory as they come in a variety colours including neon pink and grey and look like the popular plastic sandals @entity38			1
the new shoes were designed by @entity18 with the help of @entity43 equestrian team farrier @entity41			2
@entity18 , managing director of @entity7 , which is based in @entity45 , @entity46 , said : ' it 's an up - to - date solution to shoeing a horse , that has been updated from what was introduced 500 years ago			1
' farriers nailed steel shoes to horses ' feet back then because that was their only option , but now we have designed a much more comfortable option for horses which makes much better sense , and helps fix worn and tired hooves			0
' but farriers can breathe a sigh of relief - the @entity7 wo n't see their trade become obsolete			2
under @entity67 law a horse must have its shoes fitted professionally			0
the concept , which is the first of its kind to be created in the @entity67 was thought up from an idea had by a designer in the @entity74			0
quicker : instead of using nails , the shoe uses glue and takes around three minutes to fit healthy : the shoe allows medicine or cream for injured horses to be applied under the shoe fashion accessory : the shoes come in a variety of bright colours including neon pink and green while the @entity74 concept relies on gluing shoes to horses feet , the horse is forced to stand still for more than 15 minutes - which often means it has to be tranquilised			1
the @entity74 way is also a more messy procedure as the plastic coating on the shoe has to be mixed and applied in the stable			2
the @entity101 however slots simply onto the horse 's hoof and is glued on - a process that takes around three minutes			1
the plastic flaps around the top of the shoe simply bend backwards and forwards to accommodate any shaped hoof			2
new shoes : @entity113 @entity112 attaches a new rubber horse shoe called @entity115 to @entity21 , pictured with her owner @entity116 at her stable in @entity24 , @entity25 although having a horseshoe fitted the original way is n't painful for the animal - it has no nerves in its hoof - it is said by vets to be an improvement to the old method			1
@entity18 added : ' @entity125 does damage horses feet			0
everywhere else in the world , you can shoe your own horses feet , but in the @entity67 you have to use a farrier who will only use a traditional horseshoe at the minute			1
' it 's a brilliant alternative for horses in the @entity67 , and we have spoken to lots of vets who agree its a marked improvement for horses feet			0
' ' we have created a range of different colours for the @entity7 as recently people have started to pay for their horses to have cosmetic items , such as headcollars and bridles			0
' people want to style and accessories their horses more and more , and we wanted to fit into that market , and not just give the product another standard leather - look finish			0
' @entity153 had the company 's first bright pink shoes fitted to her horse @entity21 last week at @entity24			0
the @entity7 is especially suitable for horses who are lame or unable to walk , and the product means medicated creams and treatments can be placed inside the shoe so they can work effectively on the horse 's hoof			1
@entity18 , who has been a product designer for 30 years , said : ' we have had a horse that could not walk because he was in so much pain from an infection he had in his hoof			1
' as soon as he had the shoes on , he was running around like an excited foal , the shoes changed his life for him			0
' people are left with horses they ca n't ride , and as soon as they are fitted with these shoes they can again			0
they 're such a straight forward concept but they are so effective			0

instead of nails , the shoe is glued on to the horse 's hoof
