@entity0 back on top in ratings war after saturday 's live show beats @entity3 by @entity5 last updated at 3:02 pm on 7th november 2011 it was a big shock in @entity7 with show favourites @entity9 and @entity10 being voted off in a double elimination			1
flamboyant @entity10 was voted off after going head - to - head in a sing - off with fellow @entity15 25s act @entity16			2
and surprisingly , @entity18 wildboy @entity17 managed to stay another week , despite his panned performance on saturday night			1
farewell : @entity10 puts on a brave face with his former mentor @entity21 game over : @entity23 and @entity24 of the risk leave the x factor studios for the final time his mentor @entity29 was forced to choose between @entity10 and @entity16 , admitting he thought the blonde singer was more likely to get a recording act			2
after it was announced that @entity10 was going home , both @entity32 and @entity33 shed a tear for the popular finalist			2
choosing between his acts , @entity32 said : ' they 've been incredible to work with			0
they were both incredible in the sing - off			0
i have to pick the person who i think in the real world who would get a recording act and the act i 'm gon na have to send home is @entity10			0
' decision time : @entity10 was voted off after a sing - off with @entity16 shock factor : the risk ( @entity52 ) @entity23 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity24 were the first to leave joining @entity10 on stage , who appeared to accept his fate with good humour , @entity32 added : ' this guy is a brilliant singer , he 's a great character , he 's gon na have a great career			1
i hate to see him go home			0
' @entity10 said : ' i wan na thank everyone who have got behind me			0
all the judges , everyone out there in the @entity68 who accepted me for just being me			0
' unemployed @entity10 , 45 , sang @entity71 ' @entity70 , while @entity16 , 26 , sang @entity73 's beautiful disaster			1
our acts have gone : both mentors @entity21 and @entity77 were visibly upset farewell : @entity16 embraces @entity10 after finding out he 's going home after the sing - off @entity77 said : ' i get along with both of you really well			1
i 've got to go with the act that i look forward to watching perform each week so the act i 'm sending home this week is @entity10			0
' @entity73 lamented : ' the act that i 'm looking to that is gon na provide us with something more in the competition is @entity10			0
' although @entity90 's decision cemented @entity10 's departure , @entity33 added : ' @entity10 is one of the nicest people in this competition			1
' tough decision : @entity90 chose @entity10 , but @entity33 got emotional when he praised the singer 's lovely character while the pair fought for survival in a sing - off , boy band @entity9 were eliminated straightaway after receiving lowest vote			1
the risk 's exit came as a shock as only a week ago they were second favourite to win the show by the bookies			1
but perhaps their recent change of line - up after @entity54 , 16 , replaced @entity113 may have affected their chances			0
singing for survival : @entity16 sang @entity73 's beautiful disaster while @entity10 belted out @entity71 ' @entity70 group hug : @entity77 commiserates with the risk after they hear they are heading home @entity122 : 9/4 @entity123 : 3/1 @entity124 : 7/2 @entity125 : 9/2 @entity126 : 7/1 @entity16 : 40/1 @entity17 : 50/1 ( @entity127 ) when asked how they felt by @entity130 , the risk singer @entity24 said : ' i dunno what is it			1
i 'm just happy we 're here together			0
' @entity23 added : ' we 're @entity9 , we 're just gon na carry on , ' while bandmate @entity53 said : ' it 's been a honour to sing with these guys			1
' @entity77 's girl band @entity126 were the first to find out they were through until next week , followed by the new bookies favourite @entity122			2
despite landing in the bottom two last week , @entity140 singer @entity125 was thrilled to find out she was safe for another week			0
there was shock when @entity17 got through , with the singer evidently surprised he had managed to survive another week after his performance of @entity146 ' i got ta feeling the previous night			0
surviving another week : @entity17 - the bookies ' favourite to leave the show this weekend - amazingly stayed meanwhile , x factor alumni jls and @entity152 and @entity150 performed their latest singles @entity153			2
the results show comes after @entity0 managed to beat @entity3 in the ratings war on saturday night			1
a peak of 11million tuned in to watch the @entity158 - themed week on @entity0 , compared to 10.5million with @entity3 on @entity159			1
and then there was one : @entity77 's sole remaining act @entity126 were first to find out they were through to next week monochrome : @entity90 and @entity77 both opted for white dresses			2
