@entity0 just might be @entity1 's most dedicated fan boy			2
the @entity3 - based tiler and father - of - two has been an avid follower of the @entity6 since he was a child , and is now living the dream in his very own ' @entity6 museum ' home			1

' from our home to the kids to my work and everything in between			2
it 's a real labour of love			0

@entity0 lost his father as a teenager , and as the eldest child it fell to him to help his mother raise his brothers and sisters			0

' i had to be the man of the house , ' explained @entity0			0
' the creator of the @entity6 , @entity45 , put so much pathos into his tales , ' ' they taught me about responsibility and about how to do the right thing			1

' it 's an iconic cover , and we made it our own			0
we used it for the invitations , and created an album for the guests too , ' ' i asked the artist to recreate it with myself and @entity56 as @entity64 and @entity66 , and we had all our favourite @entity6 characters in the background as wedding guests			1
' @entity0 and @entity56 's invitation for their @entity6 - themed wedding in 2011 having planned their honeymoon around that year 's @entity84 in @entity85 , @entity0 started trawling online forums and discovered that the creator of @entity6 , @entity45 , had been announced as a special guest			1
' i was so excited , ' said @entity0			0
' i was chatting in a forum with other like - minded fans , and explained to them the story of my dad 's passing and how much the @entity6 had meant to me at that time , and the way it has impacted on my life , ' ' little known to me , one of the members knew @entity45 's agency , and told them all about my story			1
they got in contact with me and asked if i 'd like to meet him and spend some time together			2
' the opportunity to meet the man responsible for the world that has meant so much to him was incredible			1
' to be able to meet him as an adult , shake his hand , and say thank you to him was just amazing , ' said @entity0			2
' i 've actually met him six times now , and i think i can almost call him a friend			2
each time he comes to @entity1 , his agency contacts me and asks if i 'd like to come along			0
i 've been so blessed			0
' @entity0 has also met many of the other writers and creators of the @entity6 , including @entity115 and @entity116			1

' it 's everywhere i go , ' said @entity0			0
' whether i 'm at home with the kids and my wife , or at work , it 's a constant in my life , ' ' it 's a lot of work keeping ahead of the curve in terms of getting the newest collectible and seeing all the movies but 's never actually work			0
it 's always fun , and an experience that i get to share with my family '			0
' creeds like @entity64 's " with great power comes great responsibility " really resonate with me			0
ideas about doing good and doing the right thing have made such an impact on my life , ' ' even though the @entity6 characters are @entity207 images on paper or on screen you can take what they model and apply that to real life , ' ' like most people i gravitate towards heroes , but whilst the broad superhero universe is about adventure and fun , it 's also about teaching you about life and giving you a code to live by			1
