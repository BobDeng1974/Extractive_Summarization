almost 160 terraced homes that snake through the villages are boarded up or entombed behind steel shutters			1
in fact , they outnumber the properties that still have ordinary doors and windows			0
some of the empty properties are owned by private landlords but most are owned by a housing association			1
accent housing association , which owns most of the houses , says it pulled millions of pounds of investment because there is no demand for two - bed homes following the introduction of the ' bedroom tax ' @entity31 , which is particularly good for fishing , is just down the road from many of the houses the association , @entity36 , says it has withdrawn millions of pounds of regeneration cash from the villages – believing the homes can not be let			1
