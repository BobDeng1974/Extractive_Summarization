a giant species of crab normally found in the freezing waters of the @entity3 has washed up on the east coast of @entity5			1
oceanographers have been left baffled as to how the crab , which usually inhabit the icy @entity8 off the coastline of @entity10 , got 4,700 miles from its normal habitat			2
the crab was discovered on the beach in @entity14 , north @entity15 by oceanographer @entity16 and his fiancee @entity17			1
the red king crab above was found on @entity14 beach in north @entity15 by oceanographer @entity16 the formidable - looking crustacean was around 30 inches across , although the crabs can grow to have a leg span of up to five feet			1
it suggests the crab was still relatively young and may have been swept to the @entity25 by powerful currents or in a storm			0
red king crabs were first introduced to the @entity29 off northern @entity30 in the 1960s but have now become so numerous they have overflowed down the west coast of @entity33			1
some fisherman fear these massive crabs will devastate native fisheries as they devour almost everything in their path			2
although the crabs can live in a relatively wide range of water temperatures , outside ideal conditions their growth rates are severely hampered			0
the crabs are thought to be advancing around 31 miles a year			0
but despite the concerns around the crab , the species is protected under a diplomatic accord between @entity30 and @entity33 that manages fishing quotas			2
only around 250 @entity33 fishermen are allowed to catch the king crab , despite it being considered a delicacy			1
the crabs are increasingly found in the fjords around @entity33 where they are considered to be an invasive species and can devastate local species			1
some fear that the massive crabs could eventually spread as far south as @entity59 and @entity60 but the sea conditions there are considered to be too warm for them to survive			0
@entity16 , 66 , from @entity63 in @entity15 , told the @entity64 that he had sought the advice of crab expert dr @entity66 , a crab expert in @entity67 , @entity68 , who confirmed it was a red king crab			1
mr @entity16 said : ' i have dived as an amateur and professional since 1966 and never seen one anywhere near here before			0
' i have heard that king crabs have migrated under the @entity3 ice cap and been found in @entity33 , but this is so far south			2
' the couple found the crab lying on the sands at @entity14 on friday where it was still alive , but when they returned to the beach over the weekend the crab had died			2
red king crabs get their name from the colour they turn when they are cooked			2
the average temperature that the crabs live in is between 4 degrees @entity91 ) and 10 degrees @entity92 )			0
the red king crab , seen here next to a pound coin for scale , did not survive for long on the beach at @entity14 it is around 4,700 miles from the @entity8 where king red crabs are normally found to @entity14 in @entity15 depending on the stage in their life they live at different depths - moving to between 20 and 50 metres by the age of two and down to 200 metres as adults			1
mr @entity16 said : ' i know my crustaceans and when i saw this one , i knew it was special			0
' i know king crabs are common in the @entity3 , especially around @entity10 , and they have turned up in @entity33 recently , but how on earth this one has got so far south , i have no idea			1
' to my knowledge , this is the first one			0
' it could only come from very cold , deep water but we do n’t have very cold deep water in the @entity120			0
perhaps it was on its summer holidays			0
' red king crabs are considered a pest in @entity33 where they are invading fjords			1
only a handful of fishermen are allowed to catch the giant crabs , as shown above , due to a diplomatic agreement with @entity30			0

adult red king crabs can grow to have a leg span of up to five feet across
they can devour native species but are also considered to be a delicacy
