those children born to teenage mothers tend not to perform as well academically as the children of older mothers , a new study has found			1
a team of scientists at the @entity7 found the level of education a mother attains can predict her children 's success in reading and maths			2
their findings showed that success is greater if a mother had her child later in life			0
@entity20 , the study 's lead author , said children born to mothers aged 19 or older usually enter kindergarten with higher levels of achievement			1
she said the researchers found these children continued to excel in maths and reading at higher levels by the time they reach 13 to 14 , when compared to those children of mothers 18 and younger			1
scientists at the @entity7 found children to mothers aged 19 or older usually enter kindergarten with higher levels of achievement			1
file picture ' these results provide compelling evidence that having a child during adolescence has enduring negative consequences for the achievement of the next generation , ' dr @entity20 said			2
the negative consequences of teen mothers were found not only to affect the child born when the mother was an adolescent , but also any subsequent children			1
professor @entity51 , of the @entity52 and @entity53 , said the findings present good news and bad news			0
' the good news is that the children of teen mothers who continue their education after having children do better academically than children of teen moms who did not continue , ' she said			0
' however , these children - and other children born to the mother when she was n't an adolescent - never catch up in achievement across time to children whose mothers had them after completing their education			2
' this group continues to carry a risk for lower achievement			0
' the study 's data was taken from the @entity75 , a nationally representative sample of children who were first assessed upon entering kindergarten in 1998 and were interviewed through spring 2007			0
in 14,279 cases , the children 's maths and reading scores were collected in third , fifth and eighth grades			0
lead author @entity20 said the researchers found these children continued to excel in maths and reading at higher levels by 14 , when compared to those children of mothers 18 and younger			1
file picture researchers used this data to compare achievement trajectories of children born either to teen mothers aged 18 or younger to adult mothers , aged 19 and older			1
the analyses took into account mothers ' educational expectations for their children , the home environment and other characteristics , such as household income , that may influence children 's achievement			0
trends indicate that mothers who give birth during adolescence have much lower rates of high school completion and college enrollment in comparison to their counterparts who delay pregnancy			0
dr @entity20 said given that growth in achievement generally stays the same across time for math and reading for all children in the sample , these patterns highlight the importance of investing in early interventions that target adolescent mothers and provide them with the skills needed to promote their children 's learning .			2
