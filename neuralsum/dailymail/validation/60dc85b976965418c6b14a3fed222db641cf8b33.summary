glamour at every turn : tourists can gain a close glimpse of the @entity13 sign with via a ranch ride no one bats an eyelid , except me			1
running into the odd @entity31 - or desperate housewife - is business as usual in @entity13 , particularly in awards season			1
but you do n't stand much chance if your @entity37 experience is limited to the @entity38 and cemented handprints outside the @entity40 on @entity41			0
happily , there are plenty of better hotspots where you can catch up with your favourite celebs			0
i spy @entity46 at the bar of the @entity48 , where @entity16 , was spotted the night before the @entity15			1
the following evening , i dodge the paparazzi waiting for @entity50 outside @entity51 in @entity13			1
i am tucking into my southern fried honey chicken when she slips out via the kitchen			0
the next morning , while crowds gather at a glossy shopping complex for a mediocre view of the @entity58 , i venture deep into the surrounding hills to get the ultimate glimpse			1
