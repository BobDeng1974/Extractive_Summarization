@entity0 has told his @entity2 team - mates it ’s time they woke up and realised they are in a relegation battle			1
it might have been handy if someone had shared the message before they got off their bus in @entity11 on saturday			2
if @entity2 do go down , and their final fixtures suggest it is a distinct possibility , then this will be among the missed opportunities they regret the most			2
what a curious sight to see @entity19 ’s players so lethargic , disinterested almost , in the first half against a side with nothing tangible to play for			2
@entity0 scores against @entity11 but @entity2 still fell to a 3 - 1 defeat at the @entity25 on saturday @entity2 defender @entity0 is keeping faith that the @entity27 will avoid relegation despite a tough run of games @entity2 have only scored twice in their last six away games in the league			1
stranger still when you consider their final seven games include fixtures against @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40			0
they did n’t manage a shot on target until they were two goals behind and , as they did against @entity48 a fortnight ago , they waited until the game was almost out of sight before stringing a few passes together			0
that wo n’t cut it on this run - in and @entity0 , whose goal briefly had @entity2 in the game at 2 - 1 , knows it			1
he said : ‘ it ’s like we need to go 2 - 0 down to get going and that ’s not great from our point of view			2
@entity63 lifts the ball over @entity2 goalkeeper @entity65 to seal a 3 - 1 victory for @entity11 @entity63 celebrates his second goal of the afternoon to push @entity2 close towards the relegation zone ‘ the situation is worrying			1
it ’s always worrying when you are down there because there are always twists and turns in the last few weeks			0
‘ this has got to be a massive wake - up call because it ’s all right when you are a few places above the relegation zone but you look at the points difference and it ’s nothing really , a weekend can change it			1
‘ we are definitely bang in it			0
it ’s always the same , every year there are teams that put runs together and others who get dragged into it			0
@entity63 unleashed a thunderous overhead kick before half - time to capitalise on some poor @entity2 defending @entity92 's red card left @entity2 in a difficult position , when they were threatening to get back into it ‘ we have to realise that we are fighting for every point			1
we need to sort it out			0
’ @entity97 put @entity11 ahead and @entity63 scored a brilliant bicycle kick for 2 - 0			1
@entity0 got @entity2 back in the game before @entity92 was sent off and @entity63 finished the job in stoppage time			1
the @entity102 has now scored eight times this season but it remains to be seen if he stays beyond the summer following his agitations for a move in january			0
@entity107 said : ‘ we can not afford to lose any quality players and @entity109 is a quality player			0
we are only looking to add which we have to do if we want to do well next season			0

@entity2 lost 3 - 1 to @entity11 to slip towards relegation zone
@entity63 double does the *damage* as @entity27 struggle
@entity92 was sent off , and @entity2 have a very tough run - in
