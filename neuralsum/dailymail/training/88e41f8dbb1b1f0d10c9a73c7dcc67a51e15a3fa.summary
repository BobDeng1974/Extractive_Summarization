by @entity0 @entity1 is paying four times more for its execution drugs from a new supplier , putting it in line with a local consumer rate but well below the cost in at least one other death penalty state			1
the prison agency in the nation 's busiest death penalty state paid $ 13,500 for its most recent batch of pentobarbital at a cost of $ 1,500 per vial , compared to $ 350 per dose spent last year , according to documents obtained by @entity0 under an open records request			1
the extra cost - a minuscule part of the @entity21 's $ 3 billion annual budget - comes after the state 's previous supplier refused to provide more of the powerful sedative last year , claiming it had become a target of execution opponents			1
this may 27 , 2008 , file photo , shows the gurney in the death chamber in @entity29 , @entity1 prison officials have since found a new compound pharmacy for pentobarbital , and have waged a successful legal battle to keep the business ' name secret			2
backlash from capital punishment adversaries has curtailed the number of mainstream drug companies willing to provide lethal chemical doses to states			0
but it 's not clear whether the increased cost is tied to that			0
industry groups and the @entity46 say they do not track prices for the drug and could not speculate on what factors might have driven the cost up for @entity1			2
several other state prison agencies have refused to release details on their drug purchases and @entity1 officials also have declined to comment on details			1
' we 're confident we 're complying with all state and federal laws , ' prison spokesman @entity56 said			0
the agency 's higher cost does not appear extraordinary			0
a survey of nearly two dozen pharmacies in the @entity65 area shows @entity66 , the brand name for pentobarbital , sells for about $ 1,500			1
the cost is a bargain compared to @entity71 , which also uses pentobarbital for executions			0
records earlier this year showed state officials paid as much as $ 8,000 per dose			2
at least ten inmates have execution dates in the coming months , including two in september , which means @entity1 ' latest batch of pentobarbital is set to run out by the end of the year			1
the agency has confirmed it will attempt to purchase more drugs , but @entity56 would not address whether the agency expects costs to rise further or whether it will use the same supplier			0
the latest drug purchase , in mid-march , was made by the warden at the @entity21 @entity91 , where executions are carried out			0
it also included an additional $ 425 for tests to ensure the drugs ' potency			0
@entity1 and many other death penalty states confronted with execution - drug shortages have turned to compounding pharmacies , which custom - make medications that the @entity46 considers unapproved and does not verify their safety or effectiveness			2
but @entity1 ' one - drug protocol has avoided the problems found in @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 , which all use midazolam as part of a two - or three - drug mixture and had executions go awry in the last year			2
the records provided to the @entity0 are redacted to conceal references to @entity1 ' new supplier			0
just a few years ago , it cost $ 83.55 in @entity1 for its former three - drug combination of sodium thiopental , pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride administered to condemned prisoners			1
but @entity122 , the sole @entity123 manufacturer of sodium thiopental , stopped production in 2010 and dropped plans to produce it in @entity127 because the government there asked for guarantees it never would be used in executions			0
@entity1 responded by switching to pentobarbital , but @entity134 - based @entity133 , the drug 's only @entity123 - licensed maker , bowed to pressure from death penalty opponents and announced its medication was off - limits for capital punishment			1
the @entity1 prison agency then opted to purchase pentobarbital from @entity142 until the @entity65 - area company refused to provide more drugs in october			1
the owner wrote a letter to the agency accusing state officials of placing him ' in the middle of a firestorm ' of hate mail and potential litigation when his company 's name became public			0
@entity1 attorney general @entity156 has supported the prison agency 's refusal to publicly name its new supplier , citing a ' threat assessment ' signed by @entity162 director @entity161 that says pharmacies selling execution drugs face ' a substantial threat of physical harm			1

the cost of the execution drug pentobarbital has risen from $ 350 to $ 1,500 per vial over the past year in @entity1
the extra cost comes after the state 's previous supplier refused to provide more of it , claiming it had become a target of execution opponents
