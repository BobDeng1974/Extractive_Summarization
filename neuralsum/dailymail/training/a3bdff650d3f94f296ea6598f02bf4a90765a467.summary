condemned : a federal judge has refused to stop the upcoming execution of @entity3 killer @entity2 , who raped and murdered a pregnant woman in 1989			1
he faces a never - tried lethal injection process that lawyers say could cause him agony and terror a condemned @entity3 killer who is due to be executed tomorrow , could face an agonizing death where he struggles to breathe in the last few minutes of his life			1
inmate @entity2 's lawyers had argued that the combination of the sedative midozolam and painkiller hydropmorphone could lead to a painful and terrifying phenomenon called ' air hunger ' before he actually dies			1
it 's the first time such a cocktail of drugs have been used in the state in this way , and the effects are unknown so much so that some have described the method as akin to an ' experiment '			2
lawyers for @entity30 have attempted to stop his execution on the grounds he could experience a terrifying sensation of suffocation and that his sentencing him to death is unconstitutionally cruel			2
@entity40 district judge @entity39 said the condemned man did not present enough evidence that there is ' a substantial risk ' he will experience the " severe pain " that would constitute a violation of the ban on cruel and unusual punishment			1
last year , 450 - pound inmate @entity49 argued he was so overweight he could not be put to death humanely			0
double - killer @entity50 made a similar argument in 2008			0
in 2010 , serial rapist @entity52 argued he might be violently allergic to @entity3 's execution drug			1
each time , @entity40 district court judge @entity39 , a veteran of the state 's capital punishment legal challenges , ultimately allowed the execution to proceed			2
in his latest ruling , he said monday that @entity30 had failed to present evidence he would suffer breathing problems alleged by his attorneys - a phenomenon known as ' air hunger ' - and said the risk to @entity30 is within constitutional limits			0
. also , because @entity30 has several characteristics of sleep apnea , or the struggle to breathe while asleep , the chances are even greater he will be subjected to feelings of suffocation , an expert has warned			0
' mr. @entity2 is at a substantial risk of experiencing the terror of air hunger during the first five minutes of the execution , ' professor @entity72 , of @entity73 , said			2
' air hunger is a horrible feeling , ' @entity72 added			0
' it 's the inability to get your breath			0
' experimental : some were concerned @entity30 would experience terror as he strained to catch his breath due to @entity3 's untested execution method punishment : the death chamber at the @entity87 in @entity88			1
@entity3 used intravenous doses of two drugs , midazolam , a sedative , and hydromorphone , a painkiller , to put @entity30 to death @entity3 plans to use intravenous doses of two drugs , midazolam , a sedative , and hydromorphone , a painkiller , to put @entity30 to death			2
the method has been part of @entity3 's execution process since 2009 , though never used			1
it was chosen because of a shortage of other lethal injection drugs			1
that said , @entity39 acknowledged the novelty of @entity3 's never tried two - drug combination , calling it ' an experiment in lethal injection processes			1
' victim : @entity30 , 53 , was sentenced to die for the 1989 rape and fatal stabbing of @entity115 in @entity116 in western @entity3			1
the 22 - year - old @entity117 was newly married and pregnant but until a method violates the @entity120 , ' the law teaches that @entity3 is free to innovate and to evolve its procedures for administering capital punishment , ' @entity39 said			1
the state opposed any delay , presenting evidence that disputed the air hunger scenario			0
@entity30 , 53 , is scheduled to die thursday for the 1989 rape and fatal stabbing of @entity115 in @entity116 in western @entity3			1
attorneys say they 're disappointed by the decision but pleased @entity39 recognized the untried nature of the process			0
they have n't decided whether to appeal			0
@entity30 has a separate request before the @entity40 @entity132 to delay his execution on the grounds that a jury never heard the full extent of his chaotic and abusive childhood			2
the state asked the court monday to reject that appeal , saying @entity30 's " challenges to his sentence have spanned decades and failed			0
" @entity147 , the overweight inmate , was spared by gov. @entity149 because of poor legal representation at trial , not his weight			0
he died of natural causes in prison last year			0
@entity50 was executed in 2008 for the rape and murder of two female @entity158 students			0
@entity52 was executed in 2010 with no apparent complications as he died			0
as long ago as the 1990s , prisoners in @entity161 argued that the state 's gas chamber could also produce " air hunger " in death row inmates			0
in 1994 , a judge found that prisoners in the gas chamber were likely to suffer excruciating pain for between 15 seconds and several minutes			0
the state has since adopted lethal injection but lawsuits have kept it from being used			2
@entity39 's ruling moved @entity30 one step closer to execution by the two - drug method developed after supplies of @entity3 's former execution drug dried up			1
@entity149 has rejected @entity30 's plea for clemency			0
last year , @entity39 rejected a challenge to the two - drug method by death row inmate @entity183 , who was set to become the first to die by the new method until @entity149 delayed his execution to study the feasibility of @entity183 ' donating organs to family members			2
supplies of @entity3 's former execution drug , pentobarbital , dried up as its manufacturer put it off limits for executions			1
@entity3 's @entity194 plans to use a dose of midazolam , a sedative , combined with hydromorphone , a painkiller , to put @entity30 to death			1
the combination of drugs @entity3 intends to use has never been used in a @entity40 execution			1
they are included in @entity206 's backup execution method , and @entity207 uses midazolam as part of its three - drug injection process .			2
