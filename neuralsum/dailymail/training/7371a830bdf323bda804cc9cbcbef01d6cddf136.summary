by @entity0 follow @ @ draper_rob @entity1 is likely to make changes for the dead rubber against @entity4 on tuesday - but he still needs to win the game to avoid humiliation			2
@entity7 may get an early chance to fill the left - back berth in place of @entity11 and @entity12 may get a first start if @entity15 switch to a 4 - 3 - 3 - @entity16 dropping out - to give them more solidity in midfield			1
@entity1 , though , looks set to keep faith with the majority of the side which lost the opening two matches against @entity35 and @entity36 and condemned @entity15 to their first group - stage exit since 1958			1
that means no start for the likes of @entity41 and @entity43 - players who have been used as substitutes so far - and no sentimental inclusion for @entity46			0
probable @entity47 against @entity4 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity48 ; @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity7 ; @entity12 , @entity52 , @entity53 ; @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56			0

@entity15 have been *dumped* out at group stage for first time since 1958
*defeat* in final match would make it worst @entity63 *campaign* ever
@entity1 set to make changes with @entity7 and @entity12 in line to replace @entity11 and @entity16
