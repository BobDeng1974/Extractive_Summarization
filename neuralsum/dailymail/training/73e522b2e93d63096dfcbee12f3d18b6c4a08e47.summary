a confidential helpline has been set up to offer advice to patients who may have been treated by the dentist			0
dr @entity61 , @entity30 and @entity62 in @entity63 , said : ' it is very rare for @entity3 to be passed from a health care practitioner to a patient because all work follows strict ' infection control ' measures			0
' these measures are designed to prevent infections like @entity3 being passed between people and through our investigations into this case we are confident that all appropriate infection control measures were followed by the dentist			2
' whilst we therefore think the risk is extremely low we can not guarantee that there is no risk , so we have set up a freephone help - line where patients can ask questions and then decide if they want to have an hiv test			1
' if anyone has been treated at the @entity20 and has not received a letter but has concerns we would ask them to call the helpline number and we will be able to check their name against the list of individuals who we have been unable to trace			0
' dr @entity94 , director of public health , @entity52 and @entity53 , said : " we have identified that 247 patients were treated by this dentist			0
of these we are unable to find addresses for 14 , almost certainly because they no longer live in @entity41 and @entity53			0
' if you were seen at a sunday emergency dental clinic at @entity40 between april 2004 and april 2007 and have not yet received a letter , it is unlikely that you were treated by the dentist in question			1
