nine rail workers were just seconds from death in @entity3 after being given no warning that an 80mph passenger train was bearing down on them , rail accident investigators have said			1
the track workers , operating on a small bridge on the @entity10 main line in @entity3 , were reliant on getting visual and audible warnings of approaching trains as their view was restricted by the curvature of the track			1
but they received no advance warning that an @entity18 to @entity19 train was approaching			1
' some staff were unable to reach a safe position and pressed themselves against the bridge parapet			0
' the @entity24 has launched an investigation into the incident that happened south of @entity34 between @entity35 and @entity36 on the afternoon of september 22 this year			1
the @entity24 said the track workers comprised contract staff and a controller of site safety employed by @entity41 ( @entity42 )			1
they were packing ballast under sleepers on the up ( towards @entity46 ) main line on a small bridge			1
a lookout - operated warning system ( @entity51 ) was being used to give warning of approaching trains because of the gang 's restricted view			0
this system is designed to allow lookouts to signal the approach of a train by operating two toggle switches on an lows lookout unit			2
this then transmits a radio signal to a lows static unit which then gives both visual and audible warnings			0
the investigation will focus on why the workers were not warned of an approaching train ( file photo ) the @entity24 said that on the afternoon of the near - miss , the lows equipment was being operated by two nr lookouts , one on each side of the site of work and each equipped with an lows lookout unit			2
the lookout watching for trains on the up line was located about half a mile from the site of work , in a position which gave him a good view of trains approaching from the north			0
the static unit was located near the track workers			2
the lows is reported to have been both tested and operating normally prior to the incident			0
the @entity24 said : ' our investigation will examine the reasons why no warning was provided to the track workers			0
it will consider the sequence of events and factors that may have led to the incident , and identify any safety lessons			0
' @entity98 , general secretary of the @entity101 ( @entity100 ) union , said : ' this incident once again illustrates the dangers that confront track workers on @entity106 's railways on a daily basis			1
' we have repeatedly raised concerns about the safety of the @entity51 and this @entity24 report should force the pace for @entity41 to come up with a safer alternative			0

reliant on warnings as views of track were ' restricted '
jumped out of path of @entity18 to @entity19 train with seconds to *spare*
