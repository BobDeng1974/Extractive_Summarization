by @entity0 published : 12:13 est , 19 november 2012 updated : 02:54 est , 20 november 2012 students were offered ‘ bribes ’ of up to £ 1,000 for their university society if they attended a rally against the @entity4 ’s spending cuts			2
groups such as archaeologists and ballroom dancers were told they needed to send members to tomorrow ’s march in @entity12 to be eligible for extra funding			1
the demand – circulated by the @entity16 ’s students ’ @entity17 – was branded an unacceptable misuse of public money			2
bribes : student society leaders at @entity16 were offered ' bribes ' to get members to attend a rally against the @entity4 's spending cuts similar to the one pictured in 2010 range : societies at @entity16 include clubs for pole - dancing and knitting ( file pictures ) it provoked a storm of protest across the campus before being withdrawn with a grovelling apology			1
but the move is likely to call into question the motivation of some of the 10,000 marchers who the @entity42 claims will take part in tomorrow ’s rally			0
it will be the first time students have marched in @entity12 against funding cuts since a series of rallies in 2010			0
email : @entity51 , activities officer at @entity16 ( pictured ) @entity52 , emailed all the societies it funds informing them that if they wanted extra cash they needed to support the march during one , the building housing the @entity61 ’s headquarters was stormed , while later a car carrying prince @entity63 and the @entity64 was jostled and struck with missiles			1
last week @entity51 , a @entity66 graduate serving as activities officer at @entity67 , emailed all the societies it funds informing them that if they wanted extra cash they needed to support the march			1
‘ in order to be sure of silver or gold award , societies will need to send ten members to buy tickets and thus show support for the national student movement , ’ he wrote			0
currently , the students ’ union – itself largely funded by a £ 1.4million annual grant from the university – gives societies a basic ‘ bronze ’ award worth £ 300 a year			0
the figure rises to £ 600 for those that fulfil the criteria to attain a ‘ silver ’ award and up to £ 1,000 for those that receive a ‘ gold ’ award			0
societies also include clubs for hikers , pole - dancing , knitting , and model aircraft enthusiasts			0
one student , @entity101 , attracted 500 signatures to a petition accusing the students ’ union of ‘ holding societies to ransom by using funding as a coercive tool to force societies to adopt particular political agendas that their members may or may not agree with ’			0
horror : during one of 2010 's student rallies , a car carrying prince @entity63 and the @entity64 was jostled and struck with missiles the following day mr @entity51 sent another email offering a ‘ sincere and unreserved apology ’ and claiming the policy had been ‘ merely a written error ’			1
but the students ’ union ’s general secretary , @entity122 , said it would continue to favour societies which backed ‘ core union activities ’ such as the rally			2
@entity129 , of the @entity130 ’ @entity128 , said : ‘ it ’s unacceptable for student unions to dictate what position a particular university society should take on spending cuts , and especially so on the threat of withdrawing funds			2
‘ student leaders are stewards of taxpayers ’ money and to be so overtly political in distributing it is deeply worrying			1

student society leaders at @entity16 told if they wanted extra cash they needed to support march
email from university 's student union activities manager provoked storm of protest
@entity128 calls *incident* ' deeply worrying ' while *conservative* mp hails it as ' *improper* '
' @entity156 ' *due* to take place in @entity12 on *wednesday*
