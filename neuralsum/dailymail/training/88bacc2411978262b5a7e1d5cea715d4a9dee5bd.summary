in @entity1 on tuesday evening , @entity0 will step out for a 45 - minute appearance that may define his future as a @entity5 player			1
increasingly it appears that his time at @entity8 is on a knife - edge			0
if @entity12 flops and shows the same lack of interest some feel he has displayed off the field since joining last summer , the opportunity to wear the red shirt may not come again			2
however , against @entity17 , @entity18 will at least hand @entity12 the chance to resuscitate his @entity5 career			1
already , though , @entity12 is on the back foot			1
in a press conference in the early hours of tuesday morning , @entity37 made it clear that his new 3 - 5 - 2 system could restrict the 21 - year - old ’s role at the club , depriving @entity12 of the freedom to play in his favoured position on the wing , where as a @entity27 player he dazzled with his dazzling step - overs and blistering pace			1
it was this creativity that persuaded @entity27 supporters to place a gigantic post on @entity55 ’s south circular with the words ‘ he ’s just too good for you ’			2
@entity12 ’s performances in that final season , catapulting his local team into the top - flight , will live long in the memory at @entity65			1
at @entity8 , though , @entity12 is starting from scratch , having to prove himself all over again			2
dressing down : @entity68 and @entity69 did not see eye - to - eye during the @entity72 's time at @entity5 ' he will have to play as a striker as he ca n’t play the other positions in the system , ’ @entity37 said			1
' @entity76 can play as a wing - back			1
@entity12 can not do that so he will be a striker			2
’ at @entity5 last season , the consensus was that @entity12 simply could not get his head round the defensive responsibilities			1
there was concern that he was either unable or unwilling to further his understanding of the game			0
the player felt that @entity68 would come down particularly hard on him in training sessions , often pointing out errors that he would often ignore when they were committed by other players			0
@entity12 was not only player to disagree with @entity68 ’ methods last season but the problem for the 21 - year - old is that the manager ’s views were often shared by several others around the club			1
dream partnership : @entity104 ( left ) and @entity105 ( right ) proved to be a successful double act at @entity5 at least one @entity108 manager is understood to have been advised to stay away from a january loan move			2
nonetheless , in a season in which @entity5 slumped to their worst finish in 24 years , it seemed bizarre that @entity12 was afforded only 28 minutes - as a late substitute against @entity114 and @entity115 - as a @entity108 player under @entity68			1
eventually , he went to @entity118 but after a bright start , even @entity119 , one of the more patient characters in the game , felt compelled to drop @entity12			2
one source said only last month : ‘ i ’m just not sure he gets it at @entity5			0
he really needs to knuckle down now but i do n’t know if he will listen			0
’ certainly , if @entity37 perceives his defensive awareness to be weaker than that of @entity76 , it speaks volumes			0
united wingers have always expected to blend graft with invention			0
in the @entity33 years , @entity104 and @entity133 appreciated the backtracking of @entity105 and @entity135			0
in recent times , @entity5 have only liberated one winger from all defensive responsibilities and that was @entity140			2
@entity142 vision : @entity18 does n't believe @entity12 can fit into any of the midfield positions in his system in this new era with flying wing - backs , the wide players become arguably the most important in the team , offering attacking thrust and defensive assurance			1
it is why @entity37 needs @entity151 in prime physical shape and why he retains an interest in @entity155 ’s @entity154			0
all to play for : @entity12 faces the most important 45 minutes of his @entity5 career it is also why @entity159 was handed a contract extension within weeks of @entity37 joining the club , underlining the @entity163 ’s importance to the new regime as a defensively - minded winger			1
@entity12 , at this moment , can not be trusted in that role			0
for now , therefore , he must attempt to claw his way into a front - line that already boasts @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173 , as well as young talents @entity174 and @entity176			0
it is an unenviable task			0
@entity12 , for all his undoubted potential , scored only 13 goals in 126 matches in the @entity182 for @entity27			1
@entity37 has achieved an awful lot in his esteemed career but to convert @entity12 into a prolific frontman may extend even beyond his capabilities			1
@entity37 insists @entity12 is doing everything that is asked of him but it remains striking that he is the only member of the club ’s 26 - man tour squad that is yet to appear in a match in the @entity25			1
on saturday , in the broiling heat of @entity192 , @entity69 , along with the three other substitutes – @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity196 – were put through intensive interval sprints as part of their post-match warm down			0
conundrum : @entity18 is trying to succeed where @entity68 ( right ) failed and get the best out of @entity69 drenched in sweat and heading for the showers , @entity37 then informed the players that they would now be going to the gym for some extra conditioning			1
@entity12 was unimpressed , although in his defence it is difficult to imagine too many players that would relish a double fitness session in such circumstances			0
nonetheless , this is @entity37 ’s way and double sessions have been the order for almost every day since pre-season began in the @entity221 ’s absence at the club ’s @entity223 training ground a few weeks ago			0
that much is non-negotiable , as too is @entity12 ’s new position			0
he has an opportunity at the @entity228 – and he must not waste it			0
@entity229 and altitude affected us - @entity37			2

@entity5 winger @entity0 will play 45 minutes against @entity17
@entity12 is yet to play a game under new manager @entity18
@entity37 believes @entity12 is *incapable* of playing as a wing - back
former @entity27 star will play up front in @entity1
