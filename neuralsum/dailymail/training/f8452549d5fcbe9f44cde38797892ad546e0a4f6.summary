by @entity0 published : 16:20 est , 26 february 2014 @entity2 : 05:44 est , 27 february 2014 a @entity4 owner launched a @entity6 - style rant at problem guests who left a bad review of his hotel on @entity10			1
when one couple described a ‘ nightmare ’ stay at @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 hit back , accusing them of getting drunk , threatening other guests , damaging a wall , and failing to pay their £ 400 bill after they were removed by police			1
the original review read : ' stay clear of this hotel was the worst experience ever			1
very poorly managed extremely disappointed : ( ' was a nightmare from very beginning as they double booked our room and continually lied to us about the booking			0
' our friends came all the way from @entity41 and were very disappointed as their booking was wrong also ... ... will stay clear of this hotel and advise everyone else to ! ! ! ! ' in his rebuke , which has since been removed from the website , mr @entity16 said he had given the couple a free bottle of wine , £ 15 off their @entity51 ’s night stay plus a free overnight stay in march as an apology for double - booking their room			1
response : mr @entity16 hit back , accusing the guests of getting drunk , threatening other guests , damaging a wall , and failing to pay their £ 400 bill anger : mr @entity16 signed off from his rebuke as ' @entity6 ' he also accused the guests of deciding to get ' incoherently drunk ' , before adding that his doctor has advised him to control his anger and that he would try to be ' understanding ' and ' balanced '			1
he wrote : ' from henceforth i will remember @entity51 ’s as the miserable day that i had the misfortune to meet you , your husband and your friends from @entity41 ! ' ' and the 16th feb will now be called " hatchet sunday " in memory of the review you left us			2
' i understand that you were angry with me ... to arrive at a hotel and be told that you ca n’t have the room you booked is frustrating ! i get that ! that is why i gave you a free bottle of wine ... and £ 15 off the room ... and a free night ’s stay in march ! fighting talk : mr @entity16 write that he would remember @entity51 's as the ' miserable day that i had the misfortune to meet you , your husband and your friends from @entity41 ' check out : mr @entity16 said the guests were escorted out of his hotel in @entity95 , @entity14 by police who arrested the reviewer ’s husband for threatening behaviour , criminal damage and breach of the peace ' ( i was contemplating also throwing in a wee hug for you both ... but i felt there might be health consequences ! ) ' i have struggled to understand why you then felt the need to go on a drunken rant through the hotel , threatening customers and shouting abuse ? ( hmmmm ) ? ' i also have tried to understand why your husband wanted to drag me outside for a ‘ kicking ’ , as he put it ? ( hang on a sec , do i really need to try and understand this sort of behaviour ) ? and the massive hole in the wall of my hotel ? positive : the hotel owner said the review had done more good than harm as he was able to present the @entity4 in a favourable light ' the one you kicked with your size 7 clodhoppers ? must i try and be understanding that ( i feel the anger rising ... )			1
' mr @entity16 said the guests were escorted out of his hotel in @entity95 , @entity14 by police who arrested the reviewer ’s husband			1
@entity137 confirmed that officers had been called to the hotel on @entity140 and a wall in a bedroom had been damaged			0
a spokeswoman said : ' a 45 - year - old man has been charged following a vandalism at a hotel in @entity147 on 14th february 2014			0
' the hotel owner also commented on the reviewer giving just one star out of five for each of @entity10 ’s categories - value , location , sleep quality , rooms , cleanliness and service			2
mr @entity16 posted another ranting response to an unhappy guest who complained about a noisy toilet on @entity10 in march 2012			1
the visitor said : ' the tv had been stolen by the last guests and so had pretty much anything that was not nailed down			2
' the room we were showed to was on the top floor and as soon as we walked in we both regretted booking this place			0
' the bed had a dip in the mattress supported by some wood on the floor , the toilet when flushed made a sound akin to a @entity176 engine starting up and overall it was very cramped			0
' mr @entity16 hit back by outlining the differences between @entity176 fighter planes and the sound of a flushing toilet			1
second round : mr @entity16 posted another ranting response to an unhappy guest who complained about a noisy toilet on @entity10 in march 2012 repost : mr @entity16 's response to the reviewer , named as ' @entity187 ' in character : again the review was signed off ' @entity6 ' , a reference to the hotelier in comedy series @entity192 he said : ' i am concerned by your simile ? i hope you do n’t really think that i have powered my toilet with a supercharged @entity199 engine ! i am all for disposing of waste but that would be going a little far ! ' in order to seek clarity i suggest you go to @entity205 and type in ‘ @entity207 ’ there are a number of videos that show @entity211 in action			1
i think you will agree that they do not sound like my toilet			0
' do n’t get me wrong ? i am not defending my toilet ? it does not make a nice noise			0
but do you know ? in all my puff i have never heard a flushing toilet that made me lie back in bed , slip my weary fins behind my head and think “ aaaaah nice ! ” popular : the @entity13 currently has an overall @entity10 rating of four out of five ' if you disagree with anything that i have written then i would be only too pleased to offering you lodgings once again ( not free of charge , mind you ! ) and we can sit in the toilet together and thrash it out ! ' if you chose to take me up on this kind offer then please remember that it clearly states on all websites that check in is from 2pm and you might want to bring some sandwiches if the debate is going to stretch into the evening ? or maybe you would like it if we opened the restaurant just for you ! ' mr @entity16 , 41 , who runs his three - star b&b with wife @entity238 , 39 , even signs off his reply with ' @entity6 ' - a reference to @entity6			1
the father - of - two said : ' i was outraged when i read the review			2
upset : the father - of - two said he was ' outraged ' when her read the review on @entity10 over the edge : the owner said that the reviewer felt ' they could rub salt into the wounds with a horrible review ' ' having done all these things while they were here they felt they could rub salt into the wounds with a horrible review			1
it tipped me over the edge			0
' if a guest has a genuine grievance or bad experience they deserve to be treated with respect and a management response that is apologetic			2
' but when people are just out for revenge for something , it needs to be treated in the same way			0
' he added : ' i see trip advisor as a very useful tool for hoteliers			0
i think it ’s great			0
' it is open to abuse but the review has done a lot more good than harm for us because i was able to present the hotel in a favourable light and give a flavour of what we are like here			2
family business : mr @entity16 , 41 , runs his three - star b&b with wife @entity238 , 39 ' we had a young couple recently who wanted to see what the place was like because they thought the responses were so funny			1
' i ’m not going to pursue the £ 400 because i ’m not going to get it back			1
' his hotel has eight rooms priced between £ 55 and £ 115 plus a pub and a restaurant			2
a blurb on the hotel website reads : ' we have put an awful lot of time and passion into creating a cosy and luxurious experience for our guests			2
' each of the rooms has been given a touch of character and individuality and this is reflected in the excellent comments we have received from our guests			0
' the @entity13 currently has an overall @entity10 rating of four out of five			1
classic : a scene from comedy series @entity192 in which @entity6 , played by @entity321 , bashes a car with a branch earlier this month the owners of another @entity15 b&b accused @entity10 of operating ‘ above the law ’ after the couple lost a bitter legal wrangle over bad reviews posted on the global travel guide			1
@entity332 and @entity333 went to court in an attempt to force the £ 3billion organisation to disclose details of the writers of two negative online posts so they can sue the authors			0
the @entity341 , who run the nine - bedroom @entity343 na @entity346 guest house at @entity347 , @entity348 , maintain that both reports posted within a month of each other were fabricated and malicious			0
they wanted to raise an action for defamation against whoever posted the comments , claiming the poor reviews damaged their reputation and cost them business			0
but their legal bid stumbled at the first hurdle when a judge at the @entity364 in @entity365 rejected a request for a disclosure order to force @entity10 to reveal the names , addresses and other information on the authors ’ identity			0
in a judgment that could have far - reaching implications for other victims of bad reviews , judge @entity373 , @entity374 , ruled @entity15 courts have no jurisdiction in the matter .			0

@entity16 hit back when guests described their stay at his b&b
he accused them of getting drunk and failing to pay their £ 400 bill
