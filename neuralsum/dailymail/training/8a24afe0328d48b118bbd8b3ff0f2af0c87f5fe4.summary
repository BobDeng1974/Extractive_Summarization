the @entity28 voted 111 to 39 in favor of the measure on wednesday , sending it to @entity9 , who has previously allowed other abortion restrictions to become law without his signature			0

@entity9 said on tuesday that he would review the extended waiting period and act in a manner consistent with his other actions on abortion legislation			2

i want to make sure the unborn child has a chance to survive , ' senator @entity87 , a @entity7 pharmacist from rural southwest @entity2 , said during debate on the legislation he sponsored			2
