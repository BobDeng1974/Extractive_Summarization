by @entity0 two years ago i suddenly found myself , for the first time in my adult life , in a position where i did n’t need to work			1
over dinner one evening my husband , @entity5 , announced that he was earning enough money for me to stop working			2
‘ you could stay at home and look after the children , ’ he said , before adding rather nervously , ‘ if you want			1
’ @entity5 was right to be apprehensive			2
what he was suggesting was anathema to everything i ’d been brought up to believe in and everything i ’d assumed to be right about women ’s roles in the 21st century			1
life balance : @entity17 at home with two of her children as the daughter of a feminist single mother who ran a publishing company , it was drilled into me from a young age that women should be self - sufficient and have high ambitions			1
i was led to believe that working was the way you defined who you were and how you justified your existence			2
women who did n’t work were , well , not only lazy gold - diggers , but letting the side down			1
when people asked me as a child what i wanted to be , my answer was never ‘ a rich man ’s wife ’ or a ‘ lady that lunches ’			2
no , i wanted to be a vet , or a writer or , at times , a brain surgeon			2
in fact , looking back , i ’m not even sure i did really want to be any of those things but like most women of my generation i had been brought up to believe i should work , and what is more , i should want to work			1
but now ? i wonder if all women do n’t secretly long to be in a position where they do n’t have to work			1
few would admit it , but as i learned myself the truth is that not working not only makes your life more pleasant , it enables you to be a better mother and wife			1
as it was , my first response to @entity5 was one of utter disbelief			2
i was the editor of a woman ’s magazine			2
why on earth would i want to give up a lucrative , apparently dream role ? i dismissed his generous offer out of hand			2
but the next day i analysed my day in the office and the effect working was having on my life			2
i no longer had time to exercise			2
once i was back from the school - run , going to the gym for half - an - hour hardly seemed worth it			1
each morning i was greeted by my boss whose nickname was ( and probably still is , unless she ’s grown ) the poisoned dwarf			2
she normally had some irritating comment to make on whatever i was working on			2
' it ’s not that we working mothers really think they ’re inferior — it ’s actually that we want to be them			2
' in the afternoon i had the inevitable , fraught calls from the three children aged between eight and 12 who , once home , were at each other ’s throats with only a terrified nanny to separate them			1
in the evenings , by the time i had calmed everyone down and listened to their gripes , i was far too exhausted to even have a conversation with my husband			0
perhaps i had been a little hasty			0
‘ you ’re on , ’ i told @entity5 the very next day			0
my first day at home a few months later was a revelation			1
i got up , gave everyone breakfast , took the kids to school , went to the gym , even chatted to a talkative friend i bumped into			0
normally i ’d have been so busy and stressed i would have hidden behind my locker so as not to see her and feel obliged to chat			0
shockingly , after just one morning , i had turned into one of them			0
by them , i mean women who do n’t work			1
those that i had formerly viewed as the enemy — in part because of my feminist upbringing but also , i now realise , because i was insanely jealous of them			1
this is the unspoken truth of why a lot of stay - at - home mums come under attack			1
it ’s not that we working mothers really think they ’re inferior — it ’s actually that we want to be them			0
i firmly believe a lot of working women would jump at the chance to have some time off , a view that ’s backed up by figures			1
this week it was revealed that the hours worked by married women has been steadily dropping over the past 25 years , despite an increase in the range of jobs and levels of pay available to them			1

pictured : stock image the government estimates more than a third of working mothers would like to quit their jobs if they could			0
some mums stick to their careers even when they do n’t need to because , as @entity149 , one of my new stay - at - home - mum friends , put it : ‘ they would rather be working than looking after their children			1
’ @entity149 told me she could always spot which children had mothers who worked and which had mums who did n’t			0
‘ the ones who have working mothers are so much more fraught , ’ she told me			0
‘ it ’s like they ’re tight little springs waiting to unravel			0
’ while before i ’d have dismissed her theory out of hand , based on my own experience there is truth in this			0
when i stopped working , the change in our children was as instantaneous as it was in me			0
suddenly there was laughter in the car on the way to school , a ‘ see you this afternoon mummy ’ as opposed to an anxious ‘ will you be home tonight ? ’			1
@entity17 explains : ' suddenly there was laughter in the car on the way to school , a ' see you this afternoon mummy ' as opposed to an anxious ' will you be home tonight ? '			1
pictured : @entity17 on holiday with her children the bickering diminished , there was a tranquil atmosphere that had n’t been there before			1
i was calmer , so they were calmer			0
@entity192 was n’t i worried that i was becoming a nobody ? that people would n’t take me seriously any more ? i remember the first time we went out after my ‘ liberation ’ , as i now call it			1
somebody asked me what i did for a living			0
i was so shocked i could n’t answer at first			0
to say i was a magazine editor was of course no longer true			0
' i realised that i was frightened to say i was ‘ just a mum ’ — but why ? ' ‘ i ’m between jobs , ’ i replied in the end , sounding like some failed @entity205 actress			0
i realised that i was frightened to say i was ‘ just a mum ’ — but why ? being a mum , as we all know , is actually the hardest job in the world			0
even if you have the boss from hell , you can sometimes ignore him ( or her )			0
try ignoring a two - year - old having a tantrum at your peril			1
when i was ‘ liberated ’ my children were eight , 11 and 12 and so i was able to throw myself into trawling round schools with them and prep them for the entrance exams			0
but , when i was n’t doing those things , i was doing exactly what i felt like			0
this included afternoon naps ( almost every day ) , having my nails maintained by the best in the business and lunching with friends i had previously been too busy to see			0
generally my life was much more in order			0
instead of running around like a headless chicken yelling at everyone , i was in control of myself , my life and my moods			0
@entity17 recalls : ' i realised that i was frightened to say i was ' just a mum ' - but why ? ' pictured : @entity17 with two of her children in @entity239 we had a kind of equilibrium in our lives i think we had always missed			1
looking back on the years when i was working in an office full - time , i would say that at least 70 per cent of arguments and stress were as a result of my having to devote time to work and not the family			1
an added bonus was that not only were we happier , but my husband was happier too			0
he seemed to really enjoy his role as sole provider , perhaps in part because it meant he had more of my attention , just like the children			0
of course it was not always idyllic or perfect — but i ’d be lying if i said that him being the provider and me the wife at home did n’t work better than us both working full - time			1
in fact , it might have worked rather too well			0
my diligent tutoring of our children meant that we got them all into the expensive private schools of our choice			0
so now i have to work to help pay the fees			1
but , while i might need an income , there ’s no way i ’m going back into an office full - time			2
i ’ve set up my own pr company and work from home — when it suits me and my family			1
and yes , my nails are still perfect			0
@entity17 ’s novel , the ex-factor , is out now .			1

at first , @entity17 was too scared to admit she was a stay - at - home mother
now she sees it as a ' liberation '
believes women who are *critical* of those who do *n't* work are jealous
