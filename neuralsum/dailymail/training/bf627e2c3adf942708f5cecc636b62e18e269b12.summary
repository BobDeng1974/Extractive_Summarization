growing numbers of drug - resistant diseases could trigger an ‘ apocalyptic scenario ’ comparable to a catastrophic terrorist attack , @entity1 ’s chief medical officer warned yesterday			2
dame @entity6 said there was risk that within 20 years people going for simple operations would die of routine infections because we may ‘ run out of antibiotics ’ that work			1
she told @entity15 the threat from infections that are resistant to antibiotics was so serious that the issue should be added to the government ’s national risk register of civil emergencies			1
there is a risk that within 20 years , people going for simple operations may die of routine infections due to a lack of effective antibiotics the register was established in 2008 to advise the public and businesses on national emergencies that @entity1 could face in the next five years			1
the highest priority risks on the latest register include a deadly flu outbreak and catastrophic terrorist attacks			0
speaking to mps on the @entity38 , @entity36 said she would ask the @entity40 to add antibiotic resistance to the national risk register in the light of an annual report on infectious disease she will publish in march			0
a @entity48 spokesperson told @entity49 the publication would coincide with a government strategy to promote more responsible use of antibiotics among doctors			1
she said : ' we are broadly concerned about antibiotic resistance and we are going to be publishing a strategy in march with guidance on this			0
' hospital superbugs such as @entity62 are some of the best known antibiotic - resistant diseases , but mps were warned about infections such as gonorrhea and tb that affect the general population			1
some antibiotics have already been lost to resistance			1
some antibiotics have already been lost to resistance , for example penicillin is no longer effective for some wound infections @entity75 is no longer effective for staphylococcal wound infections , ampicillin ( a form of penicillin ) is no longer used for infections of the urinary tract and ciprofloxacin ( a synthetic antibiotic ) is now useless in treating gonorrhoea			1
many more are under threat			0
new antibiotics are hard to find and to licence , the @entity86 has warned			1
from the 1940s to the 1990s the answer was to develop new antibiotics , but this development has slowed			1
new antibiotics are less profitable than treatments for chronic diseases , and much of the pharmaceutical industry now concentrates on other areas of medicine			1
dame @entity6 told the @entity96 : ‘ we need to get our act together in this country			1
’ she said : ' there are few public health issues of potentially greater importance for society than antibiotic resistance			0
it means we are at increasing risk of developing infections that can not be treated – but resistance can be managed			2
' antibiotics are losing their effectiveness at a rate that is both alarming and irreversible – similar to global warming			2
' i urge patients and prescribers to think about the drugs they are requesting and dispensing			0
' bacteria are adapting and finding ways to survive the effects of antibiotics , ultimately becoming resistant so they no longer work			2
and the more you use an antibiotic , the more bacteria become resistant to it			0
' changes in modern medicine have exacerbated the problem by making patients more susceptible to infections			2
for example , cancer treatments weaken the immune system , and the use of catheters increases the chances of bugs entering the bloodstream			0
@entity139 , chairman of the @entity86 said : ' @entity141 resistance is a global problem and it requires an international solution to tackle it			0
sistance and suggests ways that could help to form a basis for action to address them			0
' bacteria will always evolve to become resistant and this is a natural part of the cycle of evolution but by reducing the pressures that cause resistance we can help to preserve the antibiotics that we do have and no - one can underestimate how important this is			2
' tackling this problem is going to require effort from individuals , organisations and nations alike			0
but by working together we can help to combat this problem			0

dame @entity6 said people may die from routine infections after surgery within 20 years
this is due to a lack of effective antibiotics
says situation so serious that the issue should be added to @entity173 *'s* list of civil emergencies
