by @entity0 published : 19:58 est , 27 march 2013 updated : 08:34 est , 28 march 2013 before he fell ill : great @entity3 actor @entity2 in 2008 before his stroke millions will have been saddened to read on tuesday that @entity2 , now in his 90th year and one of our most loved and admired directors , is too infirm to live at home			1
he and his wife , the actress @entity10 , have been living in a nursing home for retired entertainers for the past 15 months			2
@entity2 suffered a stroke nearly five years ago , from which he has made an incomplete recovery			1
in the @entity17 and @entity18 , @entity2 became such a ubiquitous figure in the @entity3 film industry — as a director and producer , but also as president of @entity24 — that it became hard to imagine it going on without him			1
his career behind the camera had started with @entity29 ! what a @entity30 in 1969 , and @entity31 , and went on to include the equally acclaimed @entity32			0
to most people under 50 , his fame rests in directing @entity35 ( for which he won an @entity37 ) , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 — and , long after it was thought he had retired as an actor , for his role as @entity43 in @entity44			1
such was his status as a national treasure that he was immortalised as a lachrymose @entity48 puppet , overcome with theatrical displays of emotion and referring to fellow thespians as ‘ darling ’			0
but that renown as a film - maker , and as the ultimate ‘ luvvie ’ , unfairly overshadowed one very important fact about him : that , in the heyday of @entity3 cinema from the @entity59 to the @entity60 , he was one of its very finest actors , and has a claim to be the greatest of his generation			1
talented couple : a young @entity2 and wife actress @entity10 arriving for @entity67 show at the @entity68 in @entity69 multi-talented : @entity70 as @entity71 in 1947 's @entity72 , which was his first leading role @entity2 was in many of the great films of that golden age			1
in them , he demonstrated an astonishing range as an actor — he could play cowards , spivs , thugs , shallow working - class lads , and cheeky private soldiers , but also clean - cut young men , charming rogues and men of astonishing courage			2
only @entity89 , of all the greats of the @entity3 cinema , had a comparable talent			1
his film debut was in a small but striking part in @entity96 ’s naval propaganda masterpiece @entity94 , released in 1942			1
just 18 , he played a young gunner who goes into a blue funk when his ship comes under attack , his cowardice risking the lives of his shipmates			0
@entity96 , playing the ship ’s captain , talks to him sternly when the attack is over , but also shows him great kindness , forgiving a youthful indiscretion and not having the boy court - martialled			1
it is one of the most memorable moments in a very memorable film			0
after the war , @entity2 ’s career rapidly took off , and he moved from playing bit parts to starring roles			1
his first big leading part , in 1947 , was as the brutal @entity71 in @entity72 , based on @entity120 ’s novel about razorblade gangs in pre-war @entity122			2
having specialised in meek young men until this point , @entity2 had the chance to play against type			1
his portrayal of @entity71 leaves nothing wanting in comparison with the vicious , psychopathic , morally dead character @entity120 created in his novel			0
it was the first film in which @entity2 had the chance to dominate the screen , and he did			1
he makes @entity72 his film			0
brooding : @entity2 , here with @entity136 , made @entity72 his film with his arresting portrayal of the brutal @entity71 @entity72 exhibits @entity70 ’s skills superbly			1
the way his bullying swagger turns to fear on the racecourse when he realises the gang around him are about to turn on him is sublime			0
but he also shows a great command of malevolence			0
just when you think he can not become more vile , the pleasure he takes in recording a message on a vinyl disc for his deluded girlfriend in which he tells her how much he despises her is played with utter relish			0
happily for the girl , the record sticks when she plays it after @entity71 ’s death , and her illusions are unshattered			2
two other highly successful outings followed immediately afterwards			0
in @entity161 , @entity2 plays a foolish young man who , by a misjudgment , ends up convicted of a murder he has not committed			1
he is sentenced to death , but reprieved at the last minute			0
his next role could not have been more different			0
because he looked very young for his age ( he was nearly 25 but could pass for a fresh - faced teenager ) he was completely credible as the star of @entity170 , in which he plays a shopkeeper ’s son who wins a scholarship to a public school			2
challenging roles : in @entity176 in 1960 , @entity2 starred as a factory worker who would not strike although the film is dated now , it shows yet another side to @entity70 ’s talents			1
he plays the chameleon - like boy to perfection , taking him up the social ladder			0
in the @entity185 , @entity2 was in demand as a @entity188 stage actor — he and his wife were both in the original production of @entity192 by @entity193 — but he continued to play leading roles in serious dramas , many of which echoed earlier parts he had played			1
in morning departure — a bleakly realistic film about the dangers of the submarine service — he again exhibits cowardice , only to find inner strength when the crisis comes			0
satire : @entity2 starred as @entity207 in crime comedy @entity209 in 1960 , seen here with @entity211 , left and @entity212 , right , prepare to escape from the army camp but from the mid-fifties , at about the same time that he was dabbling more and more in screenwriting , @entity2 developed a new side to his acting talent , in sophisticated , satirical comedies			1
in @entity219 , a send - up of the @entity220 , he played a workshy , lead - swinging troublemaker to perfection			0
he had a bigger role three years later in what was effectively the film ’s sequel , which showed the troubled transition some soldiers made to civilian life			2
i ’m @entity231 is best remembered for @entity233 ’s magnificent depiction of the @entity235 shop steward @entity234 : but @entity2 has a strong supporting part as an entirely believable conman and wide boy			1
the peak of his satirical career was , though , in @entity209 , where he played one of a group of former @entity220 officers who band together to rob a bank			0
long - lasting career : in @entity246 from 1965 he played @entity247 opposite @entity248 again , @entity2 is pitch - perfect as someone who is not - quite - a - gentleman trying to fit in with a crowd that is not naturally his own			2
the serious roles , however , continued through the @entity185 and @entity60			0
he shines as a chirpy soldier in @entity254 , one of the most under - rated @entity3 war films of the @entity185 , set in the western desert			2
he excelled in @entity259 ’s last great epic , @entity260 , as the weak little man who , in the country ’s hour of mortal peril , takes his own @entity266 pleasure boat across the channel to help get @entity3 soldiers off the beaches of @entity270 in 1940			1
but he possibly played no finer role in his career than that of @entity274 , a factory hand sent to @entity276 by his workmates for exercising his conscience , putting his family first , and refusing to go on strike			0
it is clear the strike has been politically motivated by communists , giving the film a sinister undertone			0
@entity286 from 1971 was haunting triumph with @entity2 playing serial killer @entity288 @entity70 captures the anguish , misery and heroism of @entity274 completely in @entity176 : as in @entity72 , he commands the film			2
his integrity as an actor shines through in this film			2
although his own politics were of the @entity297 , the way in which he plays @entity274 , persecuted by organised labour , gives no quarter			0
twice in a year — the first time being i ’m @entity231 — @entity2 taps into the public unease at the way in which unelected trades unionists call the shots			2
in their different ways , both films contributed powerfully to the sense that the unions were overmighty subjects , and heading for a fall			0
celebrated : @entity2 won @entity37 for @entity310 and @entity311 for @entity35 in 1982 there were other triumphs later in his career — notably as escape organiser @entity315 in @entity316 in 1963 and , eight years later , as the mass murderer @entity317 in the chilling 10 @entity318			1
but @entity2 ’s real claim to greatness as an actor lies in the work he did before he was 40 , and which established him as a landmark figure in @entity3 culture			1
normally , retrospectives have to wait until someone dies			0
that should not be so in @entity2 ’s case : we should savour his films while he is still with us , and let him know in no uncertain terms how unequivocally great we feel his achievement is .			1

actor and director @entity2 has suffered ill health since stroke in 2008
his debut was in @entity96 ’s masterpiece in which we serve in 1942
he is one of the finest @entity3 actors of his generation
as a director he won @entity37 for @entity311 and @entity310 for @entity35
