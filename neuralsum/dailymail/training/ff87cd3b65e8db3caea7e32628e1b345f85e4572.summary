police have been accused of acting ' above the law ' after the case against a chief constable over the fatal shooting of an unarmed man collapsed because his force demanded evidence be kept secret			1
sir @entity10 , chief constable of @entity0 , was due to stand trial on monday accused of @entity13 breaches in the operation that lead to the death of a 36 - year - old man			1
father - of - two @entity17 died of a single gunshot wound to the chest after the car he was in was stopped in @entity21 , @entity22 , on march 3 2012			2
killed : father - of - two @entity17 ( pictured ) died of a single gunshot wound to the chest after the car he was in was stopped in @entity21 , @entity22 , on march 3 2012 swoop : police believed they had intelligence mr @entity17 and two others were part of an organised crime unit and were planning an armed robbery on a @entity33 's store in the village			2
above , the car he was in police believed they had intelligence mr @entity17 and two others were part of an organised crime unit and were planning an armed robbery on a @entity33 's store in the village			2
it was later discovered that he was unarmed and there were no weapons in the car			0
the three men with mr @entity17 were later acquitted of charges of conspiracy to rob			0
the @entity46 decided the marksman should not face charges for murder or manslaughter because a jury would be likely to accept that he believed his actions were necessary			0
instead , sir @entity10 , who had pleaded not guilty , had been charged under the @entity54			1
but the prosecution abandoned its case after deciding some evidence collected by police was so sensitive it would not be in the public interest to be heard in open court			1
the evidence is thought to relate to the role of paid police informants and decisions made during the extensive covert surveillance operation that led to mr @entity17 's death			1
charged : sir @entity67 , chief constable of @entity0 , had been charged under the @entity54 in relation to the police operation that led to mr @entity17 's death the judge , mr justice @entity70 , had also granted anonymity to some 30 police officers who were witnesses or would be mentioned in the case			1
but lawyers for sir @entity10 , who was prosecuted as head of the force , argued he could not get a fair trail if certain evidence was not made public in court			1
mr @entity80 ordered that the evidence should be given if the defendant was to get a fair trial - at which point the prosecution , after consulting with the police , decided not to proceed			1
mr @entity17 's family said they were ' hugely disappointed ' at the outcome and ' simply want answers '			0
and their solicitor , @entity92 , warned it could set ' a really dangerous precedent where the police are in effect above the law in cases where there is sensitive evidence , ' the @entity91 reported			2
he added that the family would approach the @entity101 next week about the future conduct of the case and may seek a public enquiry			0
the prosecution argued that during the covert operation , the @entity0 made ' 26 failings ' arising out of armed police officers being deployed without any proper intelligence basis			2
it also argued and the use of armed police was unnecessary or premature			0
the decision by @entity114 , @entity115 , to abandon the case at @entity117 effectively ends all criminal proceedings over the death of mr @entity17			0
the @entity46 said : ' we have considered the rulings made by the judge that there is material which needs to be disclosed in open court in order for the defendant to have a fair trial			1
' after consulting with relevant parties , we have concluded that we are unable to reveal that material for public interest reasons			0
we are therefore unable to proceed			0
' mr @entity17 is believed to be the first person to die in a police shooting since @entity134 in @entity135 , whose death sparked rioting in the capital and other cities across the country .			0

@entity17 fatally shot by police in 2012 after covert surveillance
sir @entity10 was charged with @entity54 breaches in operation
but force said some information was too sensitive to be heard in court
judge also granted anonymity to roughly 30 officers involved in case
lawyers for sir @entity10 said he could not have fair trial without all evidence
@entity46 *dropped* case after judge ruled secret material would have to be heard
