by @entity0 published : 05:24 est , 25 september 2012 updated : 12:20 est , 25 september 2012 it was a rock so oddly shaped that it prompted @entity3 to name it after a much loved employee who recently passed away			2
now the pyramid shaped ' @entity6 ' rock has been the first test of @entity10 's most advanced analysis instruments			1
the rover used its @entity12 ( @entity12 ) for the first time in a bid to find out what the rock was made of			1
scroll down for @entity17 the robotic arm of the @entity20 rover curiosity get up close with a pyramid shaped rock on the red planet with its @entity12 instrument			1
@entity3 named the rock after the late engineer @entity26 , who was the surface operations systems chief engineer for @entity27 and the project 's @entity10			0
he passed away on august 20th , at age 64 and was a leading engineer for all of the previous @entity3 @entity20 rovers : @entity32			1
after a short drive the preceding day to get within arm ’s reach of the football - size rock , @entity10 put its @entity12 ( @entity12 ) instrument in contact with the rock during the rover ’s 46th @entity20 day , or sol. the @entity12 is on a turret at the end of the rover ’s 7 - foot ( 2.1 - meter ) arm			1
the @entity45 ( @entity45 ) , on the same turret , was used for close - up inspection of the rock ( below )			0
the rock has been named ' @entity6 ' after a @entity3 employee who recently passed away			0
the space agency has previously renamed the rover 's landing site as ' @entity54 ' after the late sci - fi author @entity56			0
both instruments were also used on @entity6 on @entity58 ( sept. 23 )			0
the @entity61 ( @entity60 ) instrument , which shoots laser pulses at a target from the top of @entity10 ’s mast , also assessed what chemical elements are in the rock			2
using both @entity12 and @entity60 on this rock provides a cross calibration of the two instruments			2
with a final @entity60 laser testing of the rock on @entity74 ( sept. 24 ) , @entity10 finished its work on @entity6			2
engineers revealed that the target rock has a relatively smooth , gray surface with some glinty facets reflecting sunlight and reddish dust collecting in recesses in the rock			0
@entity6 is a dark , apparently uniform rock that was selected as a desirable target because it allowed the science team to compare results of the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) instrument and the @entity61 ( @entity60 ) instrument , both of which provide information about the chemical elements in a target			0
@entity12 , like @entity45 , is on the turret at the end of @entity10 's robotic arm			0
it is placed in contact with a rock to take a reading			0
@entity60 shoots laser pulses at a target from the top of the rover 's mast			2
@entity6 was also the first rock target for @entity45 , which was deployed to document the @entity12 and @entity60 analysis areas			1
the rover departed the same sol , with a drive of about 138 feet ( 42 meters ) , its longest yet			0
@entity10 landed on @entity20 seven weeks ago to begin a two - year mission using 10 instruments to assess whether a carefully chosen study area inside @entity115 has ever offered environmental conditions favorable for microbial life			1
the mysterious ' pyramid ' rock on @entity20 @entity3 engineers want to take a closer at			1
it will be the first test for @entity10 's robot arm which contains several analysis instruments			1
this image combines photographs taken by the @entity45 ( @entity45 ) cameras on curiosity 's robotic arm at three different distances from the first @entity20 rock that @entity3 's curiosity rover touched with its arm .			1

rover has touched @entity20 rocks with its analysis instruments for the first time
also deployed laser instruments to shoot holes in the rock , analysing the resulting *vapour*
