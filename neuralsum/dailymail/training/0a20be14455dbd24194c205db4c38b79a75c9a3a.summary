by @entity0 published : 19:19 est , 28 july 2013 updated : 19:30 est , 28 july 2013 the @entity1 near @entity2 , @entity3 , is the @entity4 for fruit - tree enthusiasts			1
the oldest nursery in @entity8 , it was founded in 1725 by a genius of the fruit world , @entity11			2
and his descendant , @entity12 , developed the @entity13 at , yes , a pear conference in the late 19th century			2
native : many @entity8 orchards have disappeared , drastically reducing our own home - grown varieties next month , an international group of horticulturalists and fruit experts will make a pilgrimage to the orchard to pay homage to the @entity11 family , who perfected the art of fruit breeding			1
in his day , @entity29 bred more than 75 new varieties of apple , peach , nectarine , plum , cherry , apricot and pear			0
sadly , the site the green - fingered visitors will see wo n’t be as magnificent as it once was			1
as late as 1950 , there were 300 acres of orchard here , crammed with 11,000 apple trees , 6,000 pear trees and 5,000 plum trees			0
but in 1985 , the site was sold for development and the vast majority of the orchards was dug up			1
these days , the @entity1 is a fragment of its former self			0
it is down to under five acres and 700 trees , cultivated by an admirable band of local volunteers			0
this orchard ’s story is the story of all @entity8 ’s orchards			1
since @entity62 , two - thirds of our orchards have been dug up			1
and , as those orchards have disappeared , so has our taste for apples — particularly our own home - grown varieties , many of them first bred here in @entity2			1
overall consumption of fruit has declined in these junk - food - obsessed times — but it is the apple that has particularly suffered			1
according to a new survey by market research firm @entity76 , sales of apples have fallen by 6.3 per cent over the last year			1
decline : sales of apples across the varieties have fallen by 6.3 ¿ per cent over the last year as @entity8 - bred varieties have slumped in popularity , foreign apples have thrived			1
@entity82 ’s are in decline while @entity84 and @entity85 — developed in @entity86 — are booming			0
old varieties are losing out to new ones that are being aggressively branded and marketed			0
@entity8 ’s fourth most popular apple , @entity90 , is even trademarked , meaning @entity8 farmers are n’t allowed to grow it			0
last year , a new brand , @entity94 , was advertised as though it were some kind of power snack , with the blurb : ‘ perfect for teens on the move or into sports			1
’ yet overall apple consumption among the young is in decline			0
while the over- 75s eat an average 195g of apple a week , the under - 30s consume only 100g			1
in a bid to revive the flagging market , @entity106 and @entity107 , the trade association for the fruit growers , is targeting immigrants to @entity8 , who tend not to be apple eaters , and encouraging them to make novel apple dishes , such as @entity117 lamb dhansak and @entity119 apple cake			0
they advise using @entity121 apples , another variety in decline			1
assistant chairman of the @entity125 and @entity126 , @entity127 , 58 , says : ‘ the disappearance of orchards from @entity8 has been slow year - on - year since the war , but the overall effect is seismic			1
‘ with the decline of the @entity135 after the war , we stopped shipping out apples and started shipping in cheaper ones			1
and you ca n’t go back — once you ’ve dug up an orchard , it ’s gone for good			1
you ’ve lost that link between the landscape and people , between people and local produce			0
we give tours to local primary school children who are amazed to see apples taken from a local tree			1
’ waste : despite all the wonderful apples we have growing in @entity8 , such as the @entity153 , many supermarkets prefer to import the @entity155 and @entity156 marketing campaign for @entity159 ’s @entity158 apple has often been blamed for the decline in native orchards			1
but there are other reasons that pre-date the arrival of the @entity158 , particularly the need to turn much of the countryside over to more crucial foods during @entity167 and @entity168 but the biggest reason is the growing power of the supermarket giants over our fruit consumption during the past half - century			1
the retailers will say they are only giving us what they want , but in truth , they are leading our tastes			0
they wanted apples all year round — including out of the @entity8 season — and they wanted apples that could be shipped and stored for long periods			1
they also demanded disease - free apples with a decent profit margin and guaranteed consistency of shape			1
the small - scale orchards of @entity8 could n’t guarantee these things			1
so their delicate , charmingly odd - looking apples , available only in season and prone to disease , lost out to large - scale producers and foreign big boys			1
varieties such as @entity84 are available all year round because they can be grown in the southern and northern hemispheres			1
a single @entity84 tree can produce a much higher yield than native @entity8 breeds			0
only 65 per cent of apples on a @entity82 ’s tree are good enough to be sold as ‘ class one ’ in the supermarket , while 90 per cent of the fruit on a @entity84 tree qualifies			1
a ‘ class one ’ apple must conform to strict guidelines about size , shape and taste			0
class two , which allows for greater variety in appearance , is rarely bought by the supermarkets			0
thus , many of these cosmetically imperfect , but otherwise perfectly tasty , apples go to waste			2
therefore , apples are now bred on an industrial scale , for efficiency of production , uniform size and blemish - free peel			1
all at the cost of taste			0
‘ the taste becomes secondary , ’ says mr @entity127			0
‘ if people were given a traditional “ heritage ” variety , they just would n’t know if it was ok to eat			0
but the uniform apples , like @entity90 or @entity230 , fit the bill for an urbanised society , which likes the comfort of familiarity			2
’ still , though , at the @entity1 , there remains a small patch of the idyllic fruit orchards that once covered @entity3 , much of @entity241 , @entity242 and the @entity243 in @entity244			2
the names of the 70 varieties of fruit growing here have a poetry all of their own : @entity250 , @entity252 ’s @entity251 , @entity253			0
there is an @entity255 , already turning a pretty bronze , even though it is some time till the first sunday in october , when the apples will be harvested by volunteers , to be sold as they are or turned into cider			2
in one corner of the orchard , there are @entity265 — a variety of apple that grows in a distinctive pineapple shape			0
although it ’s early in the season , you can see its tropical outline			0
@entity8 apples : the delicious @entity255 will be ready to eat in october the orchard , once in disrepair , has been restored by the volunteers following the advice laid out by @entity29 in @entity278 , his 1850 treatise that sold more than 12,000 copies , making it a bestseller of its day			2
the volunteers have planted tall beech hedges on the borders of the orchard to keep out the wind and produce an ideal micro-climate for apple - growing			2
they have cut back the grass to stop it competing for the nitrogen that is so vital for good apples			2
and when an old tree dies , they replace it with a young heritage variety			0
now , the orchard seethes with life			0
woodpeckers have pecked countless holes in some of the trees , without causing any damage to the fruit , which is picked before it becomes ripe enough for the birds to eat			0
insects fill the air , trees and grass — including the rare noble chafer beetle and goldenrod crab spider			0
scenes like this need n’t be lost for good			0
today , there are some small signs of recovery in the growth of community orchards such as these			2
and @entity318 , held in the autumn during the fruit - picking season when people can come and pick their own , are becoming increasingly popular			2
there is even a thriving apple community in @entity324 , run by the @entity325 , which plants small orchards in the city			2
sales of heritage fruit trees are up , too			2
there is one final piece of the jigsaw , though			0
we all need to choose to eat more of our ancient apple varieties — and give a wide berth to the bland , blemish - free imports			2
