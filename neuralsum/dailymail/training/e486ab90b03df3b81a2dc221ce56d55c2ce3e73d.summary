@entity1 's third wife : @entity2 as @entity3 in @entity4 viewers of the @entity7 's flagship historical drama @entity4 have reacted with shock after the ' c - word ' was used on the latest episode of the programme			1
fans of the @entity14 - themed series questioned whether the use of the word , usually considered the rudest swear word in @entity18 , was ' really necessary '			1
and 24 members of the public have filed official complaints objecting to the use of the word in the programme , which is aired on @entity25 just after the 9pm watershed			1
@entity4 , which is based on the best - selling novel by @entity28 and chronicles the rise of @entity1 's adviser @entity30 , regularly uses bad language in an apparent bid for historical accuracy			2
but the episode broadcast last wednesday was the first to feature the c - word , during a discussion between courtiers about @entity1 's third wife @entity3			1
@entity73 wrote on @entity63 : ' was the " very strong language " really necessary ? # rude '			2
a spokesman for @entity76 revealed that the regulator has received four complaints about the swearing in the episode , adding : ' we will assess these complaints before deciding whether to investigate or not			1
' in addition , 20 viewers complained to the @entity7 directly			1
the moment was also featured on @entity86 last week , provoking visible shock from the tv viewers who star in the @entity90 reality show			2
hit : the drama , starring @entity39 as @entity1 and @entity92 as @entity30 , is on @entity25 a spokesman for the @entity7 said : ' @entity4 is broadcast after the watershed and the language in this powerful scene was taken from @entity28 â€™s original text			1
' @entity4 has attracted acclaim from critics and viewers for its lavish production values and @entity92 's starring performance as @entity30			0
author : @entity4 novelist @entity28 has frequently courted controversy in the past however , it has also been the subject of controversy over its decision to use only candles to light the set , and accusations that some details are historically inaccurate			0
the novel by ms @entity28 won the 2009 @entity113 , while its sequel @entity115 was given the same award three years later			0
but despite the author 's success , she has courted high - profile rows after describing the @entity120 as a ' shop window mannequin ' and writing a short story fantasising about @entity123 being assassinated			0
the book of @entity4 also uses the c - word , which has been part of the @entity18 language since at least the 13th century			0
in its earliest centuries the word was not considered particularly obscene , and it appears multiple times in the works of @entity131			0
but by the time of @entity135 , shortly after the era in which @entity4 is set , the term appears to have become a taboo , and though the playwright alludes to it he never uses it outright			0
a @entity7 poll from 2000 found that people considered it the most offensive word of all , even ahead of vile racial slurs .			0

@entity14 - themed drama broadcast the word ' c * * * ' during last week 's episode
20 viewers have complained to the @entity7 about the use of the swear word , while four more have filed complaints with @entity76
others used @entity63 to express their shock at the *explicit* language
the word has been in use for at least *800* years despite its taboo status
