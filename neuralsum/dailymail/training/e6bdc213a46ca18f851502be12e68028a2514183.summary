by @entity0 published : 10:54 est , 9 may 2013 updated : 10:56 est , 9 may 2013 anger : @entity2 is unable to get her dog back because a council near her home in @entity6 , @entity7 , had already rehomed him when she got in touch when mother - of - five @entity2 was told her lost dog had been sent to a council kennels she thought she would swiftly be reunited with her lost pet			1
but the local authority said her beloved six - year - old @entity14 and @entity16 cross had been rehomed with a new family so she could n't have him back			1
although only six weeks had passed since @entity19 slipped out of ms @entity21 's garden , officials refused to even contact the new owner on her behalf to see if a deal could be done			1
the pet , which had been with the family since it was a puppy , had not been microchipped			1
@entity19 vanished from the family 's garden in @entity6 , @entity7 , on march 14 and ms @entity21 's son @entity27 , 16 , contacted @entity28			1
over the following six weeks the family searched the streets around her home for any sign of her dog			2
she had almost given up hope when the girlfriend of her oldest son @entity35 , 21 , put an advert on @entity37 along with a photograph of @entity19 to ask if anyone had found her pet			2
ms @entity2 was delighted to hear a few days later from a woman who recognised the picture and phoned to say that she had found the dog on march 18 on a street in @entity6			1
she had taken the dog to the @entity47 officers who put him in kennels and re-homed him seven days later			0
a council official told ms @entity21 that they could not reveal the name of the new owner or the private kennels where he was looked after on behalf of the council			2
she said : ' all i wanted was to speak to the person who had been given @entity19 so i could tell them that he was my much - loved pet and i was desperate to get him home			1
' i am sure that the new owner would be more than happy to give @entity19 back to me - but i have no way of knowing who they are unless they hear about me and make contact			1
' when i explained all this to the bloke from the council , he just told me , " it 's not your dog any more "			1
i replied , " yes it is my dog - i just want him back "			2
family pet : @entity19 vanished from the family 's garden in @entity6 , @entity7 , on march 14 owner 's fury : @entity47 said ownership of the dog had already passed so there was nothing they could do ' i said , " can i speak to the people who have got him " , and he said , " we ca n't do that "			1
' i just could n't understand his attitude			0
i guess it was just because of their confidentiality rules			0
but there is nothing to stop them getting hold of the person who has @entity19 and asking them to call me			2
' family pet : @entity19 is a six - year - old @entity14 and @entity16 cross ms @entity2 said she had initially only reported @entity19 was missing to @entity28 as it is her local authority			1
three weeks later , she contacted neighbouring councils in case her pet had been found in their areas			0
when she first made contact with @entity47 , officials failed to tell her that @entity19 had already been handed in and re-homed			1
ms @entity2 said : ' the problem is a lack of communication			2
i feel i have been treated in a disgusting way			0
' it would have been much easier if @entity19 had been microchipped , but i did not really see the need of it before now because he had never gone off before			0
' i have owned @entity114 for six years since he was a puppy			0
he is such a clever dog and i miss him every day			0
the house just is n't the same without him			0
' i 'm not angry with the new owners , i just want them to know the whole situation so we can get something sorted so that @entity19 can come home			0
' @entity123 , the @entity47 portfolio holder for environmental excellence , said : ' if this dog had a tag and / or chip , it could have been identified straight away by either the person who found it or @entity132 and returned to its owner			0
' we are very sorry to hear that this resident could not be reunited with her dog , and would urge all owners to bear in mind the heartache and expense which can be saved by a simple chip or tag for your dog 's collar			0
' a council spokesman added : ' if anyone calls @entity47 reporting a lost dog , we always recommend they call all local councils in the area			0

@entity2 had owned six - year - old @entity19 since he was a puppy
but he escaped from his family 's garden in @entity6 , @entity7
six weeks later they are told he was handed over to nearby council
but they rehomed him within seven days - and said they ca n't get him back
