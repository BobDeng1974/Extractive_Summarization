while most ' normal ' period pain can be fixed with ibuprofen or a over-the - counter anti-inflammatory , a doctor tells @entity11 that more severe symptoms such as nausea , back or leg pain or bleeding at unexpected times of the month can all point to a more serious condition - endrometriosis			1

' you can easily lower prostaglandins with an anti-inflammatory or it can be addressed and removed with diet			0
' however , @entity18 says it 's when pain is abnormal and can lead to sever pain and vomiting that women should go straight to a doctor			1
' normal period pain should be on the first or second day of bleeding , not later in the bleeding cycle or before			1
so timing is all part of the warning signs , ' says @entity18			2
spine symptoms : back and leg pain can be symptoms of endometriosis according to dr @entity18 1			1
severity : extreme pain that over the counter medication can not ease 2			0
location : lower back or leg pain 3			0
timing : pain during first two days of bleeding is normal , any other time during the cycle is not 4			2
other factors : pain during sex , bleeding between periods can be other symptoms of endometriosis ' standard pain is also most commonly in the lower belly where the uterus is			2
however extended pain that makes you vomit or that reaches the lower back or legs should n't be considered a routine thing			2
' so what are the other symptoms women should look out for ? ' pain during or after sex can also be a key symptom , according to dr @entity18			1
' patients might a deep stabbing pain , maybe not every time they have sex - it could be in middle of their cycle or any time , not just during their period			2

dr @entity18 says often women might have a mother or sister who has had severe period pain and so they think it 's normal , but as a doctor , if she finds out a patient 's relative has endometriosis then it 's instantly taken more seriously			1

' it is so easily dismissed and something often i am the first health practitioner to raise that it could be endometriosis			0
the only definitive way to know is from performing keyhole surgery , where a doctor will put someone under general and cuts into their abdomen and look what 's inside , ' says dr @entity18			1
she says while she is hopeful there will be a blood test for the condition to diagnose it soon , the biggest issue is no one yet knows what causes it , despite there being a few main theories			0
' a popular idea used to be that there is a retrograde flow that goes through the fallopian tubes , the ovary normally goes down the tube , but theory says it goes the wrong way and as embryos , the cells on the uterine lining get inflamed and grow			0
' the other theory that there is definite evidence , for according to dr @entity18 , is that most women have cell tissue outside of the uterine lining , but that it stays dormant all their lives , whereas for others it becomes activated and responds to hormones			1
but because there is n't conclusive evidence , there is yet to be a cure			0

' the doctor found out she did , removed it , and three or four months later she was pregnant and had a beautiful baby boy			0
' ' that drove home how severe it can be and important to fix it			0
it 's quite a common story now with my patients , once they have endometriosis removal they have greatly enhanced fertility , ' says dr @entity18			2
