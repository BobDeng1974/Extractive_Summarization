like super-models , they follow a strict daily diet — in their case , three carrots , an apple and a few cabbage leaves — to keep in shape for their public appearances			0
over recent months , they have been feted across the globe and pampered wherever they go			0
one is even going to have a song written about his life			0
but when i meet @entity17 — the biggest rabbit on earth — and his similarly sized son , there is little evidence of diva behaviour			1
former @entity24 model @entity23 holds her world record @entity26 rabbit @entity17 aloft five - year - old @entity17 is 4ft long and weighs just under 3st — the king of the @entity26 breed			1
he is the size of an average eight - year - old child			0
slightly wary , i join him on the floor of his owner 's home in the @entity36 village of @entity37 and find he is a thoroughly gentle soul			2
he sits quietly , as i stroke his ultra-soft , grey fur , and examine his outsized ears and paws			0
@entity17 seems nonchalant about his world record — and untroubled that he is set to lose his title to his son , @entity44			1
aged only one , @entity44 is already 3ft 8in long and weighs 2st			0
with a rabbit 's peak weight and length kicking in at the age of two , @entity44 has got some way to go			1
' he 's going to get bigger , ' says their owner , @entity23			1
' his length is amazing			2
i think he might well take @entity17 's record			1
' @entity23 , a former @entity24 model ( not a @entity23 , it must be noted ! ) , is a genius at giant rabbit - breeding			1
she has held the record for the world 's biggest rabbit , with different animals , since 2008			1
it would be no surprise if @entity44 took the title off his dad : after all , @entity17 took it from his own mother , @entity66			1
@entity17 seems nonchalant about his world record — and untroubled that he is set to lose his title to his son , @entity44 @entity23 , who has owned 100 bunnies over the past ten years , says the art of giant rabbit - breeding is simple			1
' it 's the same as humans , ' she says			2
' some breeders make the mistake of only having one big parent			2
both parents have got to be big			1
@entity44 's mum , @entity77 , is 3ft 5in long			2
she 's one of mine , too			2
' the crucial thing is that rabbits from the same family should n't interbreed			2
' you must n't , ' @entity23 stresses			1
' you end up with all sorts of illnesses , and overgrown teeth			0
' unsurprisingly , nutritious food is at the heart of giant rabbit - breeding , and @entity23 admits that @entity17 is ' very greedy '			1
as well as those daily carrots , apples and cabbage leaves , her brood have a bale of fresh hay a week between them			0
but , even with these hearty appetites , rabbit - breeding is a cheap hobby : £ 10 a week in grub for both bunnies			1
and medical care is n't expensive , either			0
' they do n't need much looking after , ' @entity23 says			1
' only vaccinations against myxomatosis , and solutions to get rid of fly eggs			0
' certainly , @entity17 — recently given a clean bill of health by vets — seems to be in very good condition , as well as being intensely relaxed			1
it 's only when i boldly try to pick him up — it 's like lifting a hefty toddler — that he struggles a bit			2
apparently , he 's a little shy of strangers but very affectionate once you get to know him			2
' @entity17 has more experience with people , ' says @entity23			1
' but he 's a little slower			2
he plods around and follows me more			0
@entity44 follows in his footsteps but he 's more energetic because he 's younger			2
' @entity23 is currently single but insists that sharing her home with giant rabbits has n't affected her love life			1
' no one has ever minded them , ' she says , ' i 'd only be with someone who likes animals			0
' she is clearly devoted to the rabbits and looks after them with great attention			2
' a lot of giants only live until the age of five			0
but mine live to eight to ten			0
' on the sad day that they die , @entity23 's beloved bunnies are buried in the garden under a rose tree			1
this devotion to animals began in her childhood			0
' i was an only child brought up by my grandmother , ' says @entity23 , who herself is a grandmother of 14 and a mother of ten			1
' i had a couple of rabbits as pets			2
i adored them — they were my little friends			0
' giant genes : @entity44 and his giant father @entity17 - who currently holds the record for being the world 's largest rabbit @entity23 had to put rabbits to one side when she embarked on a modelling career			1
she was miss @entity155 at the age of 29 , as well as the face of @entity159 and a @entity160			0
she still models — ' mostly magazine work ' — and , three years ago , at the age of 60 , she was the @entity164 's oldest ever @entity160			1
her work took her around the world , including @entity167 , where she appeared as a model in @entity24			1
as her children started to grow up , @entity23 returned to her love of rabbits			1
a friend put her in touch with a rabbit dealer in @entity175 , where the @entity26 comes from			0
in 2004 , she bought @entity177 and @entity178 — they were unrelated , so she could breed them			0
' my family were a bit shocked — they thought they were the size of dogs ! but i loved that they were so big , so gentle and loving — and very different			0
' at that stage , @entity23 had no intention of going for any records			2
but , after an article on her rabbits appeared in the local paper , she was asked if she had considered applying to the @entity195			0
like all world records , measurement had to be precise to the last millimetre and gram			0
to judge their body length , they had to be laid out and measured from front paw to back paw , with legs fully extended			0
and so it was , in 2008 , that @entity23 learned that 3ft 3in long @entity177 was a world record holder			1
@entity23 has held the record for owner of the world 's biggest rabbit ever since			1
not surprisingly in this age of bizarre hobbies and record - collecting , there 's keen competition — and @entity17 is insured ' for a lot of money '			1
is his title under threat ? @entity23 says : ' no one 's come close so far			1
' of course , i bet you are asking yourself whether what they say about the rampant breeding habits of rabbits is actually true			2
well , the answer is : yes			0
rabbits , giant or otherwise — left to their own devices — can produce 60 young a year			0
competition : @entity17 the rabbit measures 4ft 4in long while 3ft 8in @entity44 still has six months of growing to do ' that 's cruel — it would kill the mothers in the end , ' says @entity23			1
' so i keep them to two litters a year , each of around four or five rabbits			0
' it 's important to keep them relaxed			0
when it 's warm outside , they like to lie under a tree in the garden			0
but in cold weather i keep them indoors [ in large dog crates ] — although it 's the damp you should be more worried about — it gets into their bones			0
' @entity23 says her rabbits are easy to have about her home			1
they roam around the kitchen , garden and a small barn			0
they do n't have access to the rest of the house , although she sometimes takes them into the sitting room , wrapped in a blanket			0
the rabbits cost £ 500 a time for personal appearances and have regularly appeared on television — including the @entity271			0
a musician has asked if he can write a song in @entity17 's honour , and their record - breaking has featured in news bulletins all over the world			1
still , the @entity279 of the rabbit world have kept their cool , and not given in to any of the wicked temptations of global celebrity			2
whether @entity17 retains his title or his son succeeds him , you just know that there will be no bad blood between the two most famous rabbits in the universe .			1

@entity23 has owned more than 100 bunnies in the past 10 years
she claims the *secret* to breeding huge rabbits is both parents must be big
the former @entity24 model has owned the world 's largest rabbit since 2008
her rabbit @entity17 is 4ft in length but he will soon be *eclipsed* by his son
