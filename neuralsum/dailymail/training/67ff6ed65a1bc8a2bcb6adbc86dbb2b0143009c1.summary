by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 is siding with his former @entity4 co-host as he is allegedly telling @entity6 executives to let @entity7 out of her contract so that they both can move on			1
the move shows a change of heart from @entity2 as he was said to be one of the major reasons why @entity7 was so publicly ousted from the @entity4 in april			2
but really his siding with @entity7 may be an act of self - interest because he thinks that it would be a way for him and the network at large to move past the bad publicity that they earned after using @entity7 as a scapegoat for the fledgling ratings			2
today : @entity7 , pictured right with today host @entity2 , believes her demotion from the morning show may constitute a breach of contract @entity7 is being not - so - quietly courted by @entity28 as her former boss @entity29 has taken over the cable channel and wants to replace @entity32 's 8pm show with her familiar face			1
the 56 - year - old journalist officially needs approval from @entity6 to be released from her multi-year contract before going on the air for another network , and though she gave them that notice two weeks ago , the bosses have not handed down word yet			1
@entity2 , however , thinks that they are just dragging the fight out longer by not cutting their ties			0
' he canâ € ™ t imagine why the bosses are dragging their feet and are at a stalemate , ' a source told @entity49			0
out : @entity29 , right , is reportedly earmarking @entity7 for @entity28 's 8pm slot , currently inhabited by @entity32 , left ' it would allow @entity7 to get back on the air on a regular basis and everyone can move on from the debacle			1
@entity2 only wishes @entity7 the best and thinks itâ € ™ s for the best if she were to take a job at another network			2
. ' @entity7 's lawyers are arguing that her dramatic demotion from today in april was in fact a breach of her contract terms by @entity6			1
let me out : @entity7 , pictured , is begging @entity6 bosses to let her out of her contract so she can accept a high - profile anchor job at @entity28 ' @entity7 's lawyer feels that there is a very strong case to be made that @entity6 has breached terms of the deal because @entity7 was demoted from today , ' a different source previously told @entity49			1
' furthermore , @entity7 has basically been sequestered from appearing on the network			2
yes , she has been doing some work that has been assigned to her , but it has n't been steady			0
' @entity29 , previously executive producer at the @entity4 and one - time head of @entity78 , wants to put @entity7 in the prime - time 8pm slot currently occupied by @entity32 , @entity49 reported			1
today is set to finish the year trailing its rival @entity81			0
@entity7 was dumped as co-anchor of the @entity6 morning show after today lost its top spot , as bosses thought a fresh face may bring back viewers			1
but the depressing ratings got worse , something which has vindicated @entity7 , according to @entity49			0
the website claims things wo n't improve for today until @entity6 sets @entity7 free			1
' the numbers just do n't lie			0
( @entity7 ) was n't responsible for the show tanking in the ratings , ' the insider said			0
' @entity7 does n't like the fact that the show is n't back on top , but her on - air presence was n't the problem			0
' in fact , the show lost more viewers after @entity7 departed the show			0
as long as @entity7 remains at @entity6 , it will be a constant reminder to everyone of how badly the situation was handled			2
' it would be so much better for @entity6 , @entity7 , and @entity28 if she was let out of her contract			1
it would be a new beginning and a chance for all parties involved to move on , once and for all			0
' a source recently told the @entity118 that @entity32 could transition to a ' @entity120 role ' as a globetrotting correspondent , if @entity7 bumped him from his spot .			0
