by @entity0 published : 12:40 est , 25 june 2013 updated : 12:40 est , 25 june 2013 @entity1 describes @entity1 's new @entity3 campaign as ' stripped back to the raw power of the clothes and the models '			1
she says there is ' no set , no distraction ' , and in the case of one of the models used in the stark , electric shoot , there are barely any clothes , either			0
@entity17 supermodel @entity16 , a long - time @entity18 favourite , appears in two images for the brand 's new campaign - in one wearing just a fluffy yellow and black coat , and in another simply three colourful handbags , carefully positioned to cover her modesty			2
a nude @entity16 appears in the campaign in one shot to be completely naked , apart from three strategically - placed colourful @entity1 handbags a tousle - haired @entity16 is wrapped in a bright yellow and black fluffy animal print cat ... and nothing else with strikingly dark hair , the usually blonde mother - of - one , 39 , stares open - mouthed at the camera , clutching three @entity36 bags from the @entity38 line , in black , yellow and red , valued at £ 1,505 each			1
in the second shot , @entity16 is enveloped in a fluffy yellow and black coat , with her newly - dyed brown hair tousled over her face , and wearing nothing beneath the coat			0
@entity48 artist and model @entity47 has worked with @entity50 , @entity18 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 @entity47 was given far more clothes to wear than @entity16 , including this very unforgiving black dress , that only someone with a figure like @entity62 would be able to pull off the other models in the campaign fare slightly better than @entity16 when it comes to being permitted to remain covered up			1
@entity47 , a @entity48 artist and model who has worked with @entity50 , @entity18 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 , was given two punk outfits to wear : a pair of black pvc trousers and a sleeveless patterned top , and a @entity74 skin - tight dress			0
@entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 are snapped much more fully - dressed - though @entity75 does get the chance to flash some chest wearing a patterned , open monochrome jacket , similarly - hued and chunky biker boots			2
@entity75 wears printed monochrome trousers and open monochrome jacked with chunky biker boots @entity77 is the warmest of the bunch in a cosy wool ovecoat , leather jacket and matching trousers the campaign was shot by @entity91 & @entity92 , photography partners since 1995 and , with several @entity95 cover shots in their portfolio , old friends of the @entity17 model			1
the art director was @entity100 , best known for his work with @entity102 , and stylists were @entity104 and @entity105			0
@entity1 said : ' @entity1 campaign for @entity107 is stripped back to the raw power of the clothes and models			1
' there 's no set , no distraction , just the provocation , glamour and attitude of our fashion			0
@entity120 genius transformed @entity16 and @entity47 into these strong @entity1 characters			2
