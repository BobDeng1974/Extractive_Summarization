@entity0 has backed @entity3 chairman @entity2 's plan to increase the minimum number of home - grown players in club squads from eight to 12			1
@entity2 is facing opposition to his plans from the @entity10 but @entity11 president @entity0 said the @entity13 body would work to help him			1
it comes as @entity2 said it was ' depressing ' to read @entity17 's newspaper column claiming that managers such as @entity20 boss @entity19 may not be giving young @entity22 players a chance			1
@entity11 president @entity0 agrees with @entity26 's plans to increase number of homegrown players the @entity3 chairman wants to increase the minimum number of home - grown players from eight to 12 while there is a slight increase in the number of @entity22 players in the @entity10 this year — up from 32 % last year to 35 % — that is largely down to @entity37 being promoted			1
if they were to be relegated and replaced by @entity40 — second in the @entity41 — the proportion would fall to 31 %			0
however , only 22 % of the starters in the current top four teams are qualified to play for @entity44 , compared to 28 % last year			2
in 2014 , just 23 @entity22 players appeared in the @entity47 group stage , compared with 78 @entity48 , 55 @entity49 and 51 @entity50			0
this season the three @entity22 clubs that reached the knockout stages of the @entity47 started only 10 @entity22 players , compared to 12 @entity54 and nine @entity48 in those three sides			2
in the last two weeks only five @entity22 players started in the second legs of the knockout stage			0
in 2010 @entity59 won the @entity41 , beating @entity60 in the final			0
of that 18 - man match - day squad , only four have gone on to play more than 20 top - flight games , while double that from the @entity48 squad have done so in @entity65			2
of the 12 clubs who have played in each of the last five @entity10 seasons , the average number of home - grown players per squad has gone from 11.4 to 9.4			1
only 62 % of current home - grown players are qualified to play for @entity44			1
@entity0 , speaking after the @entity75 in @entity76 , said : ' this is a position we defend			2
we 're not only talking about @entity44 , we 're talking all of @entity13			2
mr @entity2 's struggle with the @entity3 is something we share and we agree with him			1
' with the new leader of the @entity83 it is important we establish close relations to see how we can protect home - grown , grass - roots young players in the different countries			1
we share the same perspective			0
we will work hand in hand to defend an idea that we think is the right one			0
' there is free flow of workers but there are some things that does n't work well and we need to address it			0
' @entity11 general secretary @entity99 admitted that its similar rule of eight home - grown players in @entity13 squads was not working as well as it should and called @entity2 's initiative ' fantastic '			1
he added : ' we are at eight out of 25 and we see it is not really as great as it should be so whatever move in favour of increasing home - grown players is something we can only support			1
' @entity2 's proposals are set to be discussed at a @entity10 chairmen 's meeting on thursday as well as the @entity3 board			1
they also include changing the rules so that ' home - grown ' means having trained in @entity44 for three years before the age of 18 rather than 21			1
the @entity3 chairman said : ' i thought @entity17 's column was in some ways quite depressing			1
it virtually said @entity19 is virtually saying he is not going to play the kids anyway			0
why have an academy then ? ' it 's not fair on the kids			0
it was always tough for kids to get through but it seems unfair now			0
' asked if he had looked at how the @entity3 could force the new rules through despite opposition , he replied : ' we have but that 's not the way we want to go			2
we have looked at it yes			0
' former @entity44 defender @entity17 claimed that youngsters were not being given a chance at @entity20 @entity20 ' s @entity142 is highly rated but has found chances limited under @entity19 @entity2 said all the proposals were open for discussion			1
he added : ' i think it 's more about the clubs than the leadership if you want my honest opinion			0
it 's the unfairness of a system that is massively improved because of the @entity154 ( @entity154 ) which was introduced by the @entity10 led by @entity155 , he has done a great job			2
' the trouble is that it is only any good if the kids get through the system - if they ca n't get through the system why bother ? ' we are open to discussions on all of it			0
this is a set of ideas which we think will work			0
