by @entity0 a herd of dairy cows nearly lifted the roof off their barn in central @entity6 when methane released by the animals caused an explosion			1
police in @entity12 state said in a statement that a static electric charge apparently triggered the detonation , and a spurt of flame , on monday at a farm in @entity19			1
the roof was slightly damaged and one cow suffered light burns - no - one was hurt			1
a herd of dairy cows nearly lifted the roof off their barn in central @entity6 when methane released by the animals caused an explosion ( file photo ) police say 90 cows are kept in the shed and it was n't clear why quantities of methane had built up			1
@entity33 belching and flatulence releases large quantities of the gas			2
an economist @entity38 revealed a herd of cows produces more greenhouse gas in a year than a family car produces to drive 3,000 miles			2
dr @entity43 said that 200 cows expel an annual amount of methane equivalent to the carbon dioxide emissions of a car burning 21,400 litres of petrol			2
dr @entity43 added that while co2 emissions have increased by 31 per cent in the past 250 years , methane has increased by 149 per cent over the same period			0
an economist revealed a herd of cows produces more greenhouse gas in a year than a family car produces to drive 3,000 miles methane has a greater warming effect than @entity58 and a longer lifetime in the atmosphere			0
he said the gas is responsible for one fifth of global warming experienced since 1750			0
between 55 per cent and 70 per cent of methane produced comes from man - made sources , mostly farming of animals such as cows , sheep and goats , which have an additional stomach and produce large amounts of methane as they digest food			1
dr @entity43 said : ' methane emission - growth , like co2 growth , has been increasing exponentially in the developing world due to a rise in incomes leading to an increased demand for meat , and the " hamburger connection " where developing countries make a lucrative profit supplying meat to developed countries			1
' he explained that up to 75 per cent of animal methane emissions came from developing countries , with @entity88 and @entity89 being the leading producers			0
efforts are being made to reduce emissions , including providing different feed and using vaccinations , but they are in the early stages of research			0
dr @entity43 , whose research is published in the journal @entity99 , warned there could be problems with downsizing herds			0
a reduction in meat could lead to a ' disastrous ' increase in demand for fish and cereals .			0

static electric charge apparently triggered the detonation
explosion from a spurt of flame *happened* on monday at a farm in @entity19
the roof was slightly damaged and one cow suffered light burns
no - one was hurt and the reason for the *incident* is still *unclear*
