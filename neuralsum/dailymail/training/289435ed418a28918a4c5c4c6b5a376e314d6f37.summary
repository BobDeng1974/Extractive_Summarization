click here to read @entity2 's match report from @entity3 with several new signings on show for @entity8 against @entity9 on sunday , a sense of excitement was back at @entity3			1
@entity10 and @entity11 started the @entity13 game in front of their home fans for the first time , but it was @entity19 and @entity20 who really impressed			1
@entity19 stole the show with his direct running and trickery , while @entity20 's goal summed up his box - to - box performance			1
videos scroll down to watch ... @entity19 scored @entity8 's first at @entity3 in the 4 - 0 win against @entity9 on sunday @entity28 and the rest of the visiting midfield could n't handle @entity8 's new superb no 7 @entity8 lined up with a diamond formation , and four at the back for the first time this season			1
that meant @entity37 's @entity36 left back @entity11 could line up in that position for his new side , while @entity40 was used in the role @entity42 preferred him in , the base of the midfield			2
@entity19 and @entity20 were given the ' running roles ' in midfield , providing width for the first part , but also covering centrally when needed			2
the former in particular , excelled in this role			0
the 26 - year - old winger was experimented in the role last season by @entity37 and @entity53 , with @entity54 praising his dynamism and work rate in certain fixtures , particularly against @entity58			0
that speed and energy was on show again versus @entity9 , with the majority of @entity8 's attacks coming down the left			1
@entity19 was often laying the ball off before sprinting for a quick one - two , while his lung - busting runs on and off the ball were difficult for @entity68 to handle			2
excitement levels soared every time @entity19 touched the ball ... his pace was frightening @entity19 was @entity73 ... click here to view more stats with our wonderful @entity76 @entity11 excelled down the left hand side and formed a partnership with @entity37 team mate @entity19 @entity11 was unlucky not to be credited with an assist after a fine run resulted in a well placed cross he also worked well down that side with @entity11 , as they did for @entity37 in the @entity36 , and the former @entity86 man was unlucky not to be credited with an assist after his fine run forward was matched by a neat cross to find @entity20			1
@entity90 poked the ball away from the @entity92 at the final second			0
the @entity94 , @entity96 effect was clear every time @entity19 had it ; the crowd were on the edge of their seats in the knowledge something would happen when the ball was at his feet			0
with @entity106 and @entity107 asked to spread to provide more width at times , that also gave @entity19 space to run at @entity28 centrally when he wanted			1
his inadvertent goal from a sublime crossed free - kick was certainly deserved , and as his confidence grew in the second half the tricks came out			0
the supporters were in awe as a couple of back heels from @entity19 in his own half left the @entity9 players dumbfounded			1
@entity8 fans have got used to their no 7 's producing the spectacular , and they have surely found another one to do just that			2
pinpoint accuracy with his crosses , outside of the foot finesse and the quick feet to humiliate anybody			0
@entity19 is the real deal from @entity53			0
@entity10 started at the base of the diamond and impressed technically , but he will need to improve physically @entity135 's injury gave blind the chance to impress in his favoured role , ' no 6 '			2
the 24 - year - old has been used as utiliy player throughout his career , and has operated at left - back , centre midfield , and even centre back for his national team			0
@entity145 described him in the build - up as an ' extremely intelligent player ' tactically , and his technical ability was clear to see , especially given the midfield options @entity8 have had in the past			2
blind started moves from the back , read the game well and has a wand of a left foot			0
one attribute he may want to build on is of a physical nature , with @entity161 dominating him at times			0
opposing teams may look to target this in the future			0
@entity20 netted his first goal for @entity8 from the edge of the box against @entity9 @entity20 started at the right of a midfield diamond but popped up in a number of positions @entity20 was another man who was brought in ( albeit by @entity173 initially ) with the view to being able to fulfill several tactical duties			1
his favourite position would probably be the tip of this diamond , but he performed well on the right hand side			0
he was possibly @entity8 's most dangerous player in and around the box , often arriving late and could have had more than his one goal in the first half alone			2
he was occasionally caught in possession when looking for a spectacular long range pass , but as with @entity19 , his energy and ability would have been extremely pleasing for @entity186			0
@entity187 came on late on for @entity188 as he joined up with @entity106 and @entity90 up top @entity187 was the man all @entity8 fans were dying to see make his debut , but they were made to wait for the @entity193 striker			1
interestingly , he came on for @entity188 off the bench , meaning @entity107 , @entity106 and @entity187 were all on the pitch at the same time			1
@entity106 and @entity107 switched between dropping deep and supporting the 28 - year - old , and it could be a system @entity186 opts for in the future			1
the @entity201 boss used over 30 players in five competitive games , but he may well have found a team and system that sticks			1
especially if @entity19 continues this form .			0

@entity19 the star of the show as @entity8 beat @entity9 4 - 0
the @entity212 winger could be the next *big* no 7 at @entity3
@entity19 scored one goal and set up another in an *electrifying* performance
@entity20 also on the *scoresheet* as midfielder impressed
@entity10 and @entity11 did n't put a foot *wrong*
@entity187 came on late on and played with @entity106 and @entity107
@entity224 has used over 30 players in five competitive games
