it 's one of the most famous homes in @entity2 , but we recognise it best from its well - guarded front exteriors ; it 's rare we get to peek inside			0
but now the doors to the prime minister 's private apartments have been flung open , with @entity11 allowing photographers into his kitchen to capture him , on film , having a friendly chat with @entity18 chancellor @entity17			1
and naturally , being the inquisitive bunch we are , our eyes were immediately drawn to the @entity10 's bookshelf , seeing if we could get an insight into how he @entity23 spend their evenings at home			2
we can now reveal that the backless £ 665 @entity30 frame is populated with high - end foodie tomes ( the @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 by @entity35 , a fellow @entity36 and - most intriguingly - @entity37 ) , as well as art and decor books ( @entity40 and artists , @entity42 ) , dvd box sets ( two series of 24 ) , and current affairs and political reads ( @entity47 : on royalty )			1
what 's on @entity11 's bookshelf ? a photograph of prime minister @entity11 and @entity18 chancellor @entity17 chatting in his @entity53 apartments cookbooks and box sets : the @entity11 family bookshelf is full of high - end foodie tomes - including @entity33 and the @entity32 - and dvds the appearance of the diet tome , aimed at ridding people of their wobbly tummies , led some to wonder whether the prime minister might be worried about middle - age spread			1
blurb for the book claims it can help you lose 12lbs in just two weeks			1
its website encourages dieters thus : ' imagine yourself with great abs. imagine the perfect look for you — be it a firm , flat , tight , sexy belly that looks great every day or a ripped abdominal " six - pack " you can show off on the beach			0
' a similar photo , including another fascinating insight into the family 's reading habits , was taken in number 11 @entity53 ( where the family live instead of in number 10 , because the apartments are bigger ) in 2011 , featuring @entity85 and @entity86			1
in that photo other books spotted were a @entity90 coffee table book , @entity91 , the @entity92 , a large selection of children 's books , and @entity96			2
on the dvd shelf the family had a special edition @entity100 box set , a @entity101 box set , a @entity102 box set , a @entity104 box set , @entity105 and @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity111 , @entity110 , @entity112 and @entity113			1
since 2011 the family have also replaced their old toaster and kettle set with smart matching yellow appliances from the @entity118 range , £ 59.99 each they still have the mustard yellow @entity121 sofa they had three years ago			1
today mr @entity11 tweeted a photograph of the occasion , remarking : ' i 'm happy to welcome @entity17 to my @entity53 flat , after her excellent address to @entity128			1
' tweet tweet ! @entity11 posted a picture of himself and mrs @entity17 in his kitchen on @entity132 after their meeting tea with @entity136 : during her one - day visit to the @entity2 , mrs @entity17 will hold meetings with the leaders of the three main political parties , as well as having tea with queen elizabeth @entity142 the apartment is still as modern , neat and clean as it was when it was seen in 2011 , the graphite kitchen cabinets ( @entity145 ) provide a neutral palette that allows the stylish £ 1,431 yellow custom - covered @entity121 sofa from fashionable @entity2 store @entity149 to really pop. in 2011 the room was shown in considerably more detail			1
on the underlit shelves , gleaming @entity153 saucepans were perfectly aligned , their handles pointing at identical angles ; the sparkling glasses arranged neatly in descending height order			0
kitchen confidential : @entity85 chats with first lady @entity86 in the new kitchen the @entity162 had installed in their apartment at @entity164 @entity53 the books : the dvds : obviously keen cooks , the @entity162 have a range of top notch kitchen gadgets			1
a £ 500 coffee machine by @entity175 brand @entity173 - regarded as the gold standard for coffee lovers - and a £ 299 @entity179 food processor sit to the left of a smart £ 3,799 @entity182 range oven ( said to be one of the finest on offer ) , its £ 799 @entity171 hood as highly polished as the stainless steel splashback behind			0
a £ 74.99 @entity187 microwave sat corner but has been moved to a more prominent location now , and in 2011 a bottle steriliser and £ 3.99 blue plastic @entity193 baby cup were visible , marking this out as a family home with three young children			1
on the bookcase - the £ 665 library shelves in black from @entity206 direct to be precise , the interiors website owned by @entity203 's mother - the dvds and books , neatly arranged by height , can just be made out			2
among the collection we see coffee table books from renowned publishers @entity212 on art , design and @entity216 interiors - perhaps @entity23 looked to them for inspiration for her kitchen ? - as well as mrs @entity221 tome , plenty of children 's reads - and that highbrow essential , @entity226 's complete works			2
a large @entity228 collection offers insight into the possibilities of a @entity11 night in front of the television : box sets of 24 , @entity102 and @entity101 can be spotted , along with a special edition , digitally enhanced box set of @entity100 , indicating that one of the @entity162 is a big fan			2
there are two live stand - up comedy dvds from the @entity240 and @entity106 tour of popular comedian @entity105 - perhaps @entity11 's way of lightening his mood after a difficult @entity10 's question time - and drama is provided by films including @entity246 , @entity247 ' @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109			2
one assumes the @entity112 and @entity113 dvds are for the @entity162 ' children - seven - year - old @entity250 , @entity251 , five , and nine - month - old @entity252			0
on the sideboard is a shiny new @entity255 flatscreen television and two - yes two - @entity256 ( purchased , of course , with no help from parliamentary expenses ) , while underneath sits a @entity260 + box for those quiet nights in			0
when the @entity162 moved into their new four - bedroom apartment ( which they use because it ’s bigger than the family accommodation at @entity265 ) , @entity85 is said to have despaired at the dark , poky kitchen			1
@entity267 had previously admitted that when she saw the kitchen at @entity164 , her heart sank ; it was so awful and outdated			0
but at the time the @entity271 moved in , they could n’t afford to splash out			0
thanks to the the pm and his wife 's personal financial security , however , the @entity162 could - and would n't @entity267 have loved this modern , airy space , with its top - of - the - range accessories and gleaming pans ? instead of replacing the shabby 1970s kitchen already there , this large , bright , contemporary kitchen was built in addition			0
while it 's much more modern than the @entity11 's white and beige wood kitchen at their former residence in @entity286 , some of the contemporary touches are the same - the modern fixtures and fittings are familiar , but the sophisticated grey tone is all new			0
gone , or perhaps out of sight , are the £ 99 pendant light and £ 130 @entity293 clock from @entity294 , the £ 175 @entity296 blender , the £ 100 @entity298 bin and the £ 360 @entity299 for @entity301 light			0
for all their fabulous wealth though , the @entity162 show that they 're not unnecessarily lavish : the large set of stainless steel pans and knife block are back in use at @entity164			0
lived - in : @entity11 in the modern kitchen at his former residence in @entity286 - note the same pans and knife block have resurfaced in the new kitchen at @entity164			0
