by @entity1 reporter there are faster ways to get a message to someone , but there 's something enchanting about the way one @entity10 teenager delivered a note to its recipient			1
@entity13 , 15 , from @entity14 , tossed a bottle into the @entity16 near his home in 2011 , as part of school project			1
three years later , he received a much faster reply - by email			0
cast away : the bottle was sent out to see off the @entity24 coastline at @entity14 , @entity10 roundabout route : because of the way ocean currents flow , it 's thought the bottle may have headed over towards @entity30 before floating back westwards towards the @entity31 ' i forgot about the entire project , ' @entity13 , told the @entity34			1
' i imagined where it would be found , but i never imagined the @entity31			1
' the bottle came ashore more than 1,000 nautical miles from where it drifted off in @entity10			1
it was found by @entity40 and @entity41 , who live in the @entity31			2
they were out walking on a private island when they came across the bottle			2
the couple say they are avid @entity48 always looking for unusual treasure			2
' at first i surmised it to have been thrown from a passing cruise ship recently , ” @entity50 told the ' @entity34			0
sending out an @entity54 : the bottle was thrown into the @entity16 at @entity14 , @entity10 in may 2011 - it came ashore in the @entity31 almost three years later , 1,000 miles away ' halfway along the first crescent i immediately spotted a large clear bottle with notes inside , ' said mr @entity50			1
' after reading the note , we emailed @entity13 and @entity61 detailing how and where we found the bottle			1
needless to say , they were astounded to get our email			0
' the note read : ' my name is @entity13			2
it is a small island in between the two forks of @entity24 , which extend out from @entity10 about 100 miles east			2
our year - round population is about 2,500 people , but in the summer we have a lot more tourists and summer people who only have summer homes out here			0
. i have a younger brother named @entity80			0
i also have a younger sister named @entity82			0
my dog is a puggle named @entity85			0
' @entity13 says he was shocked to receive a response			2
' i would n’t have believed it , ' he said			0
what makes the discovery all the more remarkable is that the bottle arrived in a location that ocean currents do not usually flow towards from where it was dropped			1
currents from @entity10 also tend to move in a northerly direction rather than south			1
it means throwing an item off the @entity10 coastline make @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 or @entity30 a more likely point of arrival			1
@entity13 's teacher , @entity61 , says he has been assigning the project for nine years but has never had a bottle come from so far south			1
' i did n't even believe it when these folks contacted me , ' mr @entity61 said			0
' i usually will get a response to the bottles within 24 hours from what i presume to be just pleasure boaters going by			0
the farthest response has been from @entity115 , which is n't very far			0
i 've never had a response come back from a legitimate far off distance			0
what a journey : the bottle ended up here in the @entity31 in what some believe could have been a 10,000 mile round trip i think the bottle made a long , long clockwise journey and some westward moving storm blew it up on the beach where they found it			1
' stormy weather could have contributed to the unusual currents , mr. @entity61 said			0
@entity13 speculated the bottle could have been drifting on that northern route when currents from @entity135 or @entity136 might have interceded with its trajectory			1
mr @entity50 also believes the bottle believes it may have taken a roundabout route to end up in the @entity31			2
' i can only surmise that there must have been a very strong outgoing tide to carry the bottle far enough out to reach the @entity143 ' mr. @entity50 said			0
while no one will ever know the course the bottle took , he speculated that it might have traveled north past @entity148 , then easterly , just south of @entity102 , then south past @entity149 and @entity150 and farther south towards the @entity151 @entity152 where the currents could have carried it west toward the southern @entity31			1
in the weeks since the bottle has been found , there there have been several emails between @entity13 and the @entity159			1
they told the @entity162 reporter they hope @entity13 ’s experience with his message in a bottle will inspire other students			2
' in today ’s world of instant communication , emails , @entity171 and @entity172 , it ’s great to hear that some of our teachers are still able to successfully stimulate our youth with some old - fashioned classroom experiments that will further stimulate them to seek answers to time - honored questions , ' mr. @entity50 said			0
' we will always need navigators , explorers , meteorologists , oceanographers and the like and it is this type of simple stimulation that our teachers can achieve with today ’s youth , ' he said .			0

@entity13 , 15 , dropped bottle into the @entity16 as part of a school assignment
his *classmates* ' bottles ended up returning to @entity14 , @entity10
@entity13 's traveled more than a thousand miles to the @entity31
couple who found it could n't believe it as ocean currents usually travel in a *northeasterly* direction from @entity10
it 's possible bottle traveled across the @entity16 to @entity30 and back before landing on *deserted* @entity31 beach
