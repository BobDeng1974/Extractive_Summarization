author ] the tax - man would be @entity3 ’s most dangerous opponent if his application for a license to promote in @entity6 really were to mean him fighting there himself			1
@entity8 would be unlikely to inflict as much damage on @entity3 as the @entity10 if they were to take a mutual bite out of the @entity13 on september 13			1
speculation that @entity3 is planning to move that world title rematch from @entity16 to the other city that never sleeps has been rife since that application was approved by the @entity19			1
@entity32 ’s company has been fronting @entity3 ’s mega-bucks fights of late but a schism has followed the acrimonious departure of chief executive @entity36 from @entity30			1
@entity36 may well be hired by @entity3 to oversee his independent shows in the future , although @entity32 is claiming that there is one fight remaining on the @entity30 contract			1
if that is enforceable , the pair would make uneasy bedfellows in september			2
although the man who calls himself @entity46 would surely find that preferable to losing a sizeable chunk of the $ 50 million - plus he can expect to bank for fighting @entity8 again			1
rematch : @entity3 's bout against @entity8 ( right ) is more likely to be held in @entity16 and that is what would happen if @entity3 boxed in either @entity53 or the new @entity54 in @entity55			1
in addition to paying @entity58 income tax @entity3 would be liable for a further 8.82 per cent state deduction from his purse , plus four per cent @entity6 tax			1
on a $ 50 million pay - night those state and city extras would cost him almost $ 6.5 million , while none of those additional levies are imposed on boxers by @entity68 or @entity16			1
the question is why would @entity3 do that , when he prefers fighting in his adopted home town in the desert anyway ? almost certainly the answer is that he wo n’t			1
another bout : after @entity3 severed ties with @entity30 promotions , former champion turned promoter @entity32 claims his company is owed one more bout under his banner the @entity81 is his favourite work - place and is believed to have been reserved for him for the @entity85 @entity84 celebration weekend , which always brings to @entity16 thousands of high - rolling boxing afficionados from south of the border			1
expect it to remain so for another big @entity85 holiday in may , when our own @entity91 may finally get his shot at dethroning the pound - for - pound king			0
@entity3 tends to delay not only hand - picking opponents but confirming the venue , presumably to crank up the site fee a little			1
but when push comes to punch for this man , there is no place like home			0
with the exquisite timing which hall - marked his halcyon years , @entity103 announced his retirement on the 17th anniversary of having his ear bitten off by @entity108 , which came also during the weekend of the iron man ’s 48th birthday			0
the fortunes of these two immense champions are inextricably linked and despite that outrage in the @entity16 ring they have become firm friends			2
that bond has been strengthened by the way they both squandered hundreds of millions of dollars earned the hard way and are working to rebuild their lives			0
friends : @entity103 ( left ) and @entity108 ( right ) are close now despite their infamous rivalry the many mansions are long gone , with @entity103 having moved out of his answer to @entity126 on the outskirts of @entity128 to a modest downtown apartment			0
so are some of the wives , although both men continue to make provision for all their children , as best they can			0
at 51 , amid concerns about his tendency to sometimes slur his words , @entity103 ’s belated hanging up of the gloves comes as something of a relief to the world of boxing			2
hopefully , the celebrity status built on his heroic exploits in the ring will provide a comfortable living hereafter			0
controversy : @entity108 infamously bites a section of @entity103 's ear off during their clash in 1997 reaction : referee @entity154 ( centre ) stops the fight in the third round as @entity103 checks his gnawed - upon ear in becoming the undisputed world champion at both cruiserweight and heavyweight @entity103 fought everyone , ducked no - one			2
in terms of the number of times one heavyweight has won the world title , he alone surpassed @entity166 when he became champion a fourth time			1
it would have been five had he not been robbed of a decision against @entity172 giant @entity170 , at the grand old age of 46			0
@entity108 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity178 ’s greatest , @entity177 , are but a few of the huge names on @entity103 ’s resume			0
but it is the extraordinary trilogy with @entity182 - one a @entity183 , one including the @entity184 , one interrupted by the crash - landing of a para-glider in the open - air vegas ring – which marked the summit of an epic career embracing 57 fights with 44 wins , 29 of them by knock - out			0
whoever nicknamed @entity195 could foresee the future			0
not one to duck : @entity177 ( left ) stands among the greats on @entity200 s esteemed resume as @entity201 continues his comeback this saturday from his solitary defeat by @entity3 he will not only be seeking victory over @entity205 but looking to evict mr @entity206 from his country ’s patriotic fight dates in @entity16			1
while those september and may schedules are lucrative for @entity3 , @entity201 insiss they are more relevant for himself as the poster boy for @entity85 boxing			2
he hopes to put down a big marker to that effect with this fight in mr @entity206 ’s favourite arena , the @entity81			2
comeback : @entity201 ( left during his only defeat to @entity3 ) returns on saturday against @entity205 , and if he wins could also clash with @entity3 over preferred dates for his next bout in @entity16 having despatched the tough @entity222 with a tenth round stoppage in one light - middleweight non-title fight , the @entity221 hopes to inflict something similar on @entity227			1
as it happens , a second convincing win in succession might even get him , like @entity8 two months from now , a rematch with @entity3			1
then they could both pack @entity233 again – and in the process make another fortune in pesos as well as dollars			0
@entity237 will be televised live on @entity238 late saturday night			0
so @entity240 ’s long - awaited world welterweight title challenge is scheduled at last – against @entity58 ’s @entity241 in @entity242 in august			2
it ’s about time , gentlemen			0
no more injuries , mr @entity240 , please			0
@entity245 will be televised live on @entity246 on august 16			0
finally : august 16 is the date locked in for @entity240 's title challenge against @entity58 @entity241			2

@entity3 may move world title rematch with @entity8 from @entity16 to @entity6
if @entity3 were to fight @entity8 in @entity6 , he would lose a sizeable chunk of the proceeds from the fight to the @entity10
