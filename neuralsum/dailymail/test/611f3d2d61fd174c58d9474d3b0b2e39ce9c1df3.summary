more often than not the process will leave you with fragments of shell in your fingers , on the kitchen counter and sometimes even in your food			0
but one canny @entity14 user , @entity15 , has uploaded a video demonstrating the simplest and swiftest way to peel a hardboiled egg - using a glass of water			1
he then places his hand over the top of the glass , completely covering it			2
his next move is to vigorously shake the glass from left to right			0
he keeps the glass in the sink so that the water does n’t spill			1
after approximately ten seconds of shaking , the @entity14 lifts his hand to show the egg , which now has a cracked shell			1
