@entity0 talks to @entity1 , who lectures and teaches seminars about tantra she has shared everything from street food reviews to suggesting water has feelings on her notorious blog			1
now @entity9 is taking a leaf out of @entity12 's book by talking all things tantric sex			2
the clean - cut actress , 42 , chats with a sex counsellor about how to use the ancient @entity18 form of meditation to create ' wild passion and deep intimacy '			1
in her latest post on @entity23 , @entity0 talks to @entity1 , who lectures and teaches seminars about tantra , about how to re-establish sexual polarity , or sexual tension , in your relationship			1
@entity1 , a yogi and psychologist , tells the mother - of - two - who announced her ' conscious uncoupling ' to @entity33 earlier this year - to let go of tightness and strain in order to ' fall into each other through eye contact '			1
she says that ' while our bodies are open and unguarded ' maintaining eye contact with your other half can be ' delicious ( and a bit scary ! ) '			1
' practice looking at each other , while staying relaxed , breathing and simply noticing when you have reached a threshold where it ’s just a bit too intimate			0
' @entity52 out there for a bit and you will find that this can be as good as sex ! ' she says			2
but in order to get to that stage , you first need to re-establish the purpose of your relationship and your sexual essence - whether masculine or feminine - so you can ' offer it as a gift '			1
she stresses that nowadays women are at work just like men , and this means they spend their days ' in the masculine aspect , making decisions and directing others '			2
' in fact , the first thing many women may want to do after work is to get " full " again , to get back into their feminine aspect			0
they might want to do this by having a glass of wine , taking a bath , chatting with a friend , their mother , or their children , or downloading their husband on their day			0
' meanwhile , their husband might want to either get into , or stay in , his masculine aspect - this means that he wants to get " empty " or be quiet			2
' as you both crave something the other does n't want , neither party ends up getting what they need			0
so @entity1 advises playing up to primitive gender roles			1
while gender equality in relationships is ' a great thing , it 's just all in the framing , ' says @entity1			2
' for many women , the idea of coming home from work and being greeted at the door by a smiling , apron - clad husband actually feels disconcerting - even though the idea of a husband who makes dinner is very appealing			0
the actress is taking a leaf out of @entity12 's book by talking all things tantric sex on her website @entity23 ' what needs to happen to create ideal sexual tension ... is for the husband to direct the wife when she steps through the door to have a glass of wine , or a bath , or to go relax and change , ' @entity1 advises			1
' he is directing her to get full			0
' women balk at this , but for sexual tension , it ’s essential			1
there needs to be that separation - getting full and getting empty - before they can come together again fully charged			0
' @entity1 and @entity0 are clearly onto a hot topic			1
almost 25 years after oversharing about his seven - hour long sex sessions with @entity143 , @entity12 's talking tantric sex again , on national tv			0
the former @entity147 frontman , 63 , and his wife , 60 , appeared on @entity150 chat show , @entity151 , yesterday , as @entity12 told host @entity152 that the pair still make love ' often ' , after decades of marriage			0
