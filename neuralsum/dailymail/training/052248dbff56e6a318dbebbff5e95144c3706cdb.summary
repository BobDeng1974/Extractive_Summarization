but two four - year - old bears are flying straight into a political storm when they land in @entity12 tomorrow			2
male panda @entity13 ( which means @entity15 ) and female @entity16 ( @entity17 ) are to receive a red - carpet welcome when their chartered @entity19 touches down at @entity22 airport			2
among those waiting on the tarmac to receive the pair - who are celebrities at home in @entity5 - will be prime minister , @entity28			1
but their forthcoming arrival has inflamed old tensions between @entity12 's @entity42 ( @entity43 - speaking ) and @entity45 populations			1
@entity43 - speaking mr @entity28 has been accused by @entity45 politicians of snubbing the country 's oldest and most famous zoo , in @entity49 , when he helped to secure the pandas ' visit to @entity12			1
borrowed : with only 2,000 pandas left in the wild , @entity5 has lent the two bears to @entity12 , which is paying ¿ 10m ( £ 8.2m ) for their visit how famous ? @entity33 was named @entity5 's favourite panda at the international @entity38 last year instead the pandas are to stay in the @entity58 animal park near the city of @entity60 , where the mayor is none other than mr @entity28			2
the 170 - year - old @entity49 zoo insists its pedigree and prestige should have made it the first choice			1
a zoo spokesman told the @entity69 it was better equipped to host the two four - year - olds , having accommodated two other pandas in 1987			2
all in all we are rather surprised that the prime minister did not think of us , ' a spokesman said			1
makeover : couriers @entity77 published this picture on their @entity80 account showing the final touches being made to the chartered plane cyber pandas : the bears ' @entity36 account detailed their flight to @entity12 @entity87 , an mp with the @entity45 separatist @entity89 party , has accused the prime minister of outright favouritism			1
' @entity28 made a political choice , ' ms @entity87 said			0
' he was not acting as prime minister of all @entity12			1
' however , @entity58 's founder and owner , @entity97 , insists the zoo was scrupulous in its application for the pandas			0
' the pandas are @entity5 , not @entity42 or @entity102 , ' he said			0
@entity58 , set up just 20 years ago , is @entity12 's most popular zoo , with 1.25 million visitors last year			0
@entity49 zoo , meanwhile , saw its visitor numbers stagnate at 840,000			1
spacious : the pandas are heading to the 20 - year - old @entity110 zoo for the duration of their stay bamboozled ? a @entity45 politician accused mr @entity114 of snubbing the 170 - year - old prestigious @entity49 zoo a shrewd commercial deal lies behind the pandas ' visit			1
@entity12 will pay an estimated € 10m ( £ 8.2m ) to host the duo but they should more than pay for themselves			0
visitors numbers to @entity124 zoo leapt 51 per cent in 2012 , the year after they began hosting pandas			0
with only around 2,000 pandas left in the wild , @entity5 is sparing about renting them out : @entity58 is one of just 17 zoos worldwide hosting the bears			0
