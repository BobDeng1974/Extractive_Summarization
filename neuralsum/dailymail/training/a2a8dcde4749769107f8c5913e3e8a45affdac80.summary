by @entity0 published : 21:58 est , 14 march 2012 updated : 10:28 est , 15 march 2012 stepping down : @entity1 has quit after just one year in the job the head of @entity6 ’s @entity5 business will step down later this year as he pays the price for a disastrous winter			1
@entity1 , a long - serving director , took on the role last march but oversaw the supermarket ’s worst @entity11 trading performance for many years			1
his position will be taken on by group chief executive @entity14 , who has pledged a much closer involvement in the @entity5 business			1
there were reports of tensions between the two men after its @entity22 campaign flopped , prompting a near £ 5 billion slump in its market value			1
mr @entity14 told @entity25 that mr @entity1 recognised ' you ca n’t have two captains in a team			1
' he added : ' this greater focus will allow me to oversee the improvements that are so important for customers			2
' @entity6 said mr @entity1 will leave the business in july once he has overseen the handover of responsibilities to mr @entity14			2
he will leave behind a @entity5 business which has very strong plans for improvement , and over the last two months these plans are beginning to show progress , in line with our expectations , ' mr @entity14 added			2
mr @entity14 has already revealed he plans to cram a three - year overhaul into the next 12 months , including a raft of initiatives dealing with online , price and home delivery			2
mr @entity1 was appointed to the board eight years ago , having joined @entity6 in 1986			2
he has held a number of marketing , commercial and store operations positions , before being appointed @entity5 and @entity55 boss in march 2011			2
@entity6 ’s share of the sector has slipped from 30.3 per cent a year ago to 29.7 per cent in the 12 weeks to february 19 , a level last seen in may 2005			1
the supermarket , @entity5 ’s biggest retailer , has announced plans to open new stores and create 20,000 jobs over the next two years as it battles back from its first profit warning in living memory			0
mr @entity1 with prime minister @entity66 at a branch of the food retailer earlier this month @entity14 ( pictured ) will take over from mr @entity1 , who quit after just one year as @entity6 's @entity5 boss it recently declared it was planning a shake - up that would see ranges and price discounts tailored to the incomes of local families			1
the strategy – spearheaded by mr @entity1 – was designed to breathe life into @entity5 sales after a disastrous fall in @entity11 takings			1
mr @entity1 , who is chief executive of @entity81 , was also the man behind @entity6 ’s ‘ @entity22 ’ campaign , which failed to deliver the boost in sales and profits the company was looking for the supermarket launched its price drop campaign on september 27 , just days before announcing their worst sales figures in 20 years			1
they fell by almost 1 per cent as customers bought less food , switched to budget rivals and turned away from luxury purchases			0
the ‘ @entity22 ’ campaign , which promised annual savings worth £ 500million , was part of an attempt by @entity6 to be recast as a champion of low prices			1
however customers , who continued to see the cost of their weekly shopping increase , were not convinced			0
@entity6 was also censured by advertising watchdogs over a price comparison campaign in which the supermarket giant claimed to be so confident it was cheaper than @entity107 and other rivals , that it would refund double the difference on any basket of groceries			1
at @entity11 , @entity6 offered a half - price frozen turkey in an attempt to rival other supermarkets			0
but it was later discovered competitors were selling their own frozen turkeys for around the same price – without the supposed 50 per cent discount			0
former group chief executive sir @entity120 led the chain for more than 13 years and oversaw its rise to become the @entity5 ’s leading supermarket			0
failed strategy : mr @entity1 was behind @entity6 's ' @entity22 ' campaign , which failed to deliver the boost in sales and profits the company was looking for during his time in charge , he took its annual pre-tax profits from £ 750million to more than £ 3billion , but @entity6 ’s performance in the @entity5 started to falter in the last years of his tenure and has continued to lag behind its main competitors in recent months			1
underlying sales in the crucial @entity11 trading period showed an annual fall of 2.3 per cent , bringing warnings that profits at the supermarket chain will not grow as expected and wiping almost £ 5billion off the share price			1
mr @entity1 was appointed to the board eight years ago , having joined @entity6 in 1986			0
he has held a number of marketing , commercial and store operations positions , before being appointed @entity5 and @entity55 boss in march 2011			0
independent retail analyst @entity147 said it was not a good sign for the business when the chief executive has to ' micro manage ' the @entity5 operation			0
he added : ' given the rumoured tensions between the two of them over the scale of the price cuts in the @entity158 , mr @entity14 ultimately had to back mr @entity1 or sack him , but the cracks are showing and it is hard to see how this will end happily			0
' while @entity6 shares were 1 per cent lower today , @entity163 analyst @entity162 kept his buy rating and said he believed the @entity5 business will recover			0
he added : ' having a group chief executive and a chief executive of the @entity5 is all very well when things are going swimmingly			0
' however , with the @entity5 70 per cent of the business and underperforming , it becomes difficult to have two captains on the bridge			0
therefore , the departure of @entity1 is a sad , but perhaps inevitable , consequence of the recent profit warning			0
