inventors have come up with a novel solution to avoid waking up a partner in the night when turning on a bedside lamp - by hiding it under the bed			1
the discreet light aims to solve the age - old problem , as it comes on automatically under the bed as you climb out for any reason - such as checking on a crying child			1
its smart motion sensor detects both light and movement and guides you to the bathroom or anywhere else you might be heading			2
called mylight , it uses motion detectors and is placed under a bed			1
when someone steps on the ground , the light turns on ( shown ) the motion sensor , which only operates in the dark , can attached to a bed leg and looks out for movement laterally			1
meanwhile , the user fits strips of led lights on the bed frame underneath the mattress			0
the kits , called mylight and made by @entity21 - based e3light , are being sold through @entity41 stores - with one priced at £ 49.99 ( $ 75 ) and two for £ 64.95 ( $ 98 )			1
the company are even in talks with hotel chains and cruise liners to use in their hotel rooms and cabins , as well as healthcare suppliers			0

but scientists have discovered that the millions who read their bedtime stories on an @entity73 or a @entity74 are actually keeping themselves awake			0
they found that people who regularly read electronic books before lights out sleep for fewer hours			0
they had reduced levels of melatonin , a hormone which plays a role in inducing sleepiness			0
the study was carried out by @entity85 and @entity87 universities in the @entity88 and published in the @entity89			0
@entity90 , 36 , global sales manager for e3light , said : ' so many people are waking up their partners every night when going to the bathroom			2
' with mylight a subtle light turns on at floor level and you are guided to your bathroom or wherever you are headed			1
' this is also why cruise lines and hotels like it - there 's no need to fumble for light you do n't know where anything is in the dark			2
' people with dementia have gained from this product as the light automatically comes on and there is no need to begin or remember where the light switch is			0
' people think its a great and original idea			0
' at first it seems like a " like to have " product and not a " need to have " , but once its installed we see clients coming back to purchase more for their children 's rooms			0
' people are now also installing it in their closets as we now also have a product called @entity132 light that does this			2
' the product can also be helpful for children who get out of bed in the middle of the night , providing them with light so they can find their way to the door			1

@entity21 - based e3light has devised a ' smart ' £ 49.99 bed light
called mylight , it uses motion detectors and is placed under a bed
when someone steps on the ground , the light turns on
but it is kept low so that others in the room are not woken
it can also help a child find their way at night if they get out of bed
