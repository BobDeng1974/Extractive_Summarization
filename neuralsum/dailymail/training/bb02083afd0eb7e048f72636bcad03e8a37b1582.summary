@entity1 news anchor @entity0 fired for swearing on his live tv debut continued his round of national media interviews with an appearance on the ‘ @entity6 ’ with @entity7 on wednesday night			1
talking about his now infamous appearance on @entity9 when his first words were ' f * * * * * * s * * * , ' @entity0 told @entity7 he ‘ crawled in bed ’ after being told that his slip had been broadcast live			1
‘ i went home , crawled in bed and called my parents , ’ @entity0 admitted			1
‘ but the next day , you got ta pick yourself up , you got ta laugh at yourself and keep going			0
several more gags were made at @entity0 ’s expense on wednesday ’s show , but @entity7 also offered words of encouragement during their chat and told him ' he would be just fine			1
' but when a cocky - sounding @entity0 made it clear he was hoping his moment of madness might turn into an offer of a bigger job ideally from @entity22 , @entity7 told him to forget it			1
‘ look , i 'm trying to get you the job back in @entity49 , forget about @entity22 , ’ said @entity7			1
‘ that ai n't gon na happen			0
you 're going back to @entity49			2
’ second chance : @entity0 , from @entity49 , @entity1 , also appeared on the @entity53 getting by : @entity0 did his best to laugh with the @entity55 anchors over the situation while still calling his gaffe inexcusable and fully expected to be fired like he was it has been a busy couple of days for @entity0 since he inadvertently dropping an f - bomb during his first day on the job and promptly got fired			1
on wednesday morning he made appearances on both @entity62 and the today show			1
on @entity66 , the show 's control room bleeped @entity0 even when he did n’t swear as a joke			2
@entity68 explained it was a ‘ precautionary bleep			2
’ still @entity0 had the last laugh as the show hired him as celebrity correspondent for a night			2
@entity74 @entity73 told @entity0 , ‘ one thing about @entity77 , we believe in giving second chances , man			1
yesterday , we called for you			0
( @entity81 ) so , we have a challenge for you if you 're willing to accept it			0
we 're going to send you to cover the star - studded red - carpet premiere of @entity86 's new movie , @entity87			0
’ said @entity68 : ‘ now , should you choose to accept this mission , your job is to interview all the celebrities that you can and bring the tape back to us here tomorrow			1
are you up for it ? what do you think ? ’ @entity0 agreed			2
‘ yeah , ’ he said , adding , ‘ yeah , definitely			0
’ spotlight : @entity97 also appeared on live with @entity68 and @entity73 earlier on the today show he revealed that at first he had no idea that his astonishing outburst had been broadcast live on air last sunday			1
' when i first saw the clip , it was gut - wrenching , ' @entity0 told the today show of those two words that first introduced him to @entity49 's evening news audience , as well as the rest of @entity110			1
' @entity111 * * * , ' @entity0 is heard just as the camera cut to him hiding his face at the anchor desk			2
' i did n't even know i said it on camera until my news director walked in on the third break , ' he said			0
his co-anchor appeared to stumble over his profanity but he says it was all a situation of the two of them being tossed to from the control room while caught off guard			0
he says he had n't yet been given an ear piece by the station and his co-anchor had forgotten hers in her car			0
poor introduction : @entity0 made the blunder during his first presenting debut on @entity9 ' i was looking down , i was going over my script , @entity134 my co-anchor happens to be looking at the camera and she notices the red light comes on , we actually came on 30 seconds early , ' he says			1
then when he saw several names he could n't pronounce related to the @entity143 winners in his upcoming script , ' fireball shot came right out of my mouth , ' he explained			0
' i fully expected that they would fire me ' he said while calling those two words ' inexcusable			0
i ’m a free agent			0
ca n’t help but laugh at myself and stay positive , ' @entity0 later wrote on @entity150 after first being suspended by the station and getting through what he described as a ' tough day			2
' ‘ i want to apologize for an incident that occurred prior to our early newscast this evening , when one of our employees used profanity on the air , ’ @entity153 , @entity9 wrote in an apology on the station 's @entity156 page on sunday			0
off guard : @entity0 told the today show that he did n't have an ear piece and the control room cut to him and his co-anchor 30 seconds earlier than expected opportunity : helping him out the anchors allowed @entity0 to toss to a commercial break as part of his new anchor reel ‘ he did not realize his microphone was on , but still , that 's no excuse			1
we train our reporters to always assume that any microphone is live at any time			0
unfortunately , that was not enough in this case			0
we ca n't take back what was said , ' she wrote			0
but what @entity0 and @entity153 both call ' inexcusable , ' may have turned into the biggest boost in his career			2
at the end of his interview @entity0 was given the privilege by @entity55 ’s @entity189 of teasing the next segments on today while throwing to a commercial break			1
' thank @entity192 for each day , ' @entity0 tweeted on wednesday			1
