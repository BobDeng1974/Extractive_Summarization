by @entity0 published : 20:11 est , 30 january 2014 updated : 20:11 est , 30 january 2014 a photograph of @entity3 , the 18th - century stately home which was immortalised in the television adaptation of @entity5 , dominates the web site of the local @entity8 and @entity7			1
@entity10 ’s tale of middle - class @entity11 and the aristocratic @entity14 family is a classic of 20th - century literature			0
but today a real - life drama is being fought out in the shadow of the imposing mansion , and it has the potential to cause severe embarrassment to @entity22			2
battle : @entity24 , left , could be ousted at the next election and replaced with @entity26 , right the sitting mp @entity24 , 59 , who has been fighting a year - long battle against deselection , will learn today whether she has seen off the local party bigwigs who want to get rid of her			1
if she loses , she will be the first female @entity32 mp in modern history to be sacked by her local party			1
@entity35 has one of the few safe conservative seats in the north of @entity38 , with a majority of 11,000			0
she is also one of only three women @entity32 @entity41 in the @entity42			0
but she has had to fight members of her own party to keep her seat on no fewer than three occasions			1
she survived her first deselection vote in 2006 , as well as in 2009 and again in 2013			2
now the 2013 ballot is being rerun and the outcome this time is far less certain			0
@entity35 ’s supporters claim she is the target of dirty tricks from old - guard diehards in the constituency association , who resent having a woman as their mp			0
they say she was the victim of a vote - rigging row like the one in @entity59 in @entity60 , which tore the @entity61 apart last year — when the unite trade union was accused of boosting membership of the local @entity61 by paying people ’s subscription without their knowledge , and using their votes to try to fix their own candidate ’s victory			1
life imitating art : the events are as dramatic as those of @entity5 , set at nearby @entity3 on the face of it , the @entity35 supporters have a point			0
a leaked report of an inquiry into the affair revealed that the @entity81 association flagrantly broke the rules when it tried to deselect her last january			0
just before holding the vote , the association ’s executive committee had taken on a significant number of new members — and it was these who ensured she was deselected			1
the stench of misogyny also engulfed the process when one unnamed local activist told the @entity93 their mp was a ‘ silly girl ’ who should be replaced by @entity96 mayor @entity95 or @entity98 leader @entity97			2
long service : @entity24 was elected in 1997 and is unafraid to criticise the government the decision to force out @entity35 caused uproar			1
her supporters demanded an inquiry by @entity105 in @entity96			0
@entity106 set aside the vote and ordered that the executive committee should be reformed in accordance with the party ’s rules			1
now , the local association is trying once again to get rid of its mp			2
and her critics believe it will be third time lucky			0
meanwhile , in a twist which could have come from the pen of @entity10 , a dashing former officer in the @entity120 called @entity26 , an @entity121 school chum of @entity22 , appears to be the choice of the party high command to replace @entity24			1
so what is the truth ? do @entity35 ’s critics have a genuine grievance against their mp ? or is this truly the @entity32 ’s @entity59 , in which unscrupulous chauvinists of the old guard are determined to see off a female foe at any cost — with @entity22 supporters eyeing the chance to replace her with one of their own ? whatever the case , there is no doubt that this episode has been deeply damaging to the @entity140			1
a report by the party ’s disciplinary committee warned that the situation in the ‘ divided and fractious ’ association had ‘ spiralled out of control ’ and was ‘ potentially damaging to the party ’			2
this time , all 560 members of the local party will vote on @entity35 ’s future — as opposed to a cabal of just 30 , which is what happened last january			1
and in a sign of the mutual distrust and loathing in the constituency , the ballot is being counted at @entity158 in @entity96 , which will announce the result today			2
what has created the crisis , according to local sources , is that @entity35 is a woman with a strong personality who has a knack for telling it as it is — and rubbing people up the wrong way			2
rebels : @entity24 and @entity171 , pictured , regularly speak against the party leadership in @entity174 none of her critics questions her work rate at @entity174 , where she has missed fewer than 17 per cent of votes and spoken more than 100 times in the past 12 months — way above average			1
but with the ballot result too close to call , even friends concede @entity35 can be ‘ awkward ’ and ‘ difficult ’ — which explains why she faces an unprecedented third no - confidence vote since first being elected in 1997 to what was the @entity186 before it became @entity8 and @entity187			1
two former constituency agents in the @entity186 fell out with @entity35			0
one of them , @entity190 , who is a now a regional director for the @entity140 , was said to have been reduced to tears more than once by the mp			1
with the ballot result too close to call , even friends concede @entity35 can be ‘ awkward ’ and ‘ difficult ’ — which explains why she faces an unprecedented third no - confidence vote since first being elected in 1997 her enemies also claim she has fallen out with 11 of her 12 association chairmen in the two constituencies in which she has served — a statistic denied by her allies			1
and if ms @entity24 wins , it will be without the backing of some of the party ’s biggest hitters , including chancellor @entity205 and education secretary @entity206			1
such @entity208 heavyweights have come to the aid of the former minister @entity210 , 68 , who is facing a similar challenge in his @entity213 constituency			0
@entity35 ’s supporters are in no doubt as to why there is a distinct lack of support from the @entity208 — although foreign secretary and neighbouring mp @entity220 is a rare supporter			0
they believe the @entity32 high command is keen for the prime minister ’s suave @entity223 chum @entity26 to take over			1
@entity26 , 47 , a barrister and judge , is heir to a baronetcy created in 1660			1
after @entity223 with @entity22 , he went to @entity227 and then @entity228 , followed by @entity230 peace - keeping duties in @entity231			0
a well - connected local councillor for ten years , he is married with three children and looks and sounds like a future cabinet minister			2
it is all strikingly different from @entity35 who was born in @entity237 , studied law at the city ’s university , and worked in the @entity241 before becoming an @entity242 in 1989			0
happily married for 21 years to @entity244 , a business executive , she has no children			0
the fallout has led the small town of @entity8 to be dubbed the @entity32 equivalent of @entity59 , @entity61 's scandal seat despite her 17 years as an mp , she has been overlooked for ministerial office			1
she is chairman of the @entity251 select committee and only this week was criticising the government ’s handling of flooding in the @entity256			1
@entity26 , who lives in the constituency , insists he has not made any move against ms @entity24			1
yet his name appeared — mistakenly , he says — on an email from two of her leading opponents attacking her record as an mp , which went to every member of the association			0
‘ it ’s no secret i ’m on the candidates list , but i do n’t know what action i will take if @entity24 does not win , ’ he says			1
spot the difference : the leadership has been keener to help @entity210 , who is in a similar predicament few @entity140 believe him			2
‘ of course he ’s going to run , ’ said one supporter of ms @entity24			2
‘ he ’s ambitious and we are convinced no 10 is behind him			0
’ if mr @entity26 prevails it will reinforce the view that mr @entity22 ’s @entity158 is dominated by a public - school - educated clique of white middle aged men			2
whatever happens , the bitterness will linger in the association for years to come			0
in picturesque @entity8 , home of @entity286 , author of the vet series @entity284 , the feud in the conservative party is a talking point in the bars and cafes dotted around the market square			1
one of the most frequent gripes is that locals rarely see @entity35 in the constituency			0
a visit to her isolated property on an estate on the outskirts of @entity8 bears out that criticism — there is still @entity303 tinsel on the window sill next to last year ’s @entity303 cards			2
however , at @entity308 the butchers they were backing her			0
@entity310 , 44 , the owner said : ‘ she regularly calls in here and you see her at the cattle market doing her surgery			0
she ’s a good mp and i would be sorry to see her go			0
’ @entity315 , who used to own a shop on the square , said : ‘ i ca n’t understand what she ’s done to upset them			0
she ’s a good mp who fights our corner at @entity174			0
’ but @entity322 , 40 , a prominent local health campaigner whose six - year - old daughter has cerebral palsy , said : ‘ i am heavily involved in the re-organisation of children ’s hospitals and she will not talk to me			0
i ’m a conservative but if she is still the candidate next time i will stand as an independent			0
’ damp reception : the mp has poured disapproval on the government 's response to floods in @entity335 a letter in the @entity337 from @entity338 , a retired hotelier and well - known figure in @entity8 , goes to the nub of the argument : ‘ as a consequence of her re-selection [ last year ] , and possibly disenchantment with the present government , many loyal members cancelled their subscriptions			1
' i am wondering what lessons @entity24 has learned from the fact that 11 chairmen have been unable to work with her and what it is that is driving her to attempt to cling on as mp in the teeth of opposition			1
’ in a statement , @entity35 accepted she had her detractors , but added : ‘ i believe i have the support of the overwhelming majority of party members			1
’ she will find out soon enough — once this unedifying selection process which is tearing the @entity140 apart is finally decided .			2

a vote in @entity8 , @entity366 , will decide @entity24 's fate today
she was elected in 1997 and has criticised the government over floods
but local party members say 11 chairman have fallen out with her
in the frame to replace her is @entity26 , 47 , an old *etonian* judge
