by @entity0 @entity1 : 11:29 est , 26 december 2013 @entity2 : 11:29 est , 26 december 2013 tablet computers hit unprecedented heights of popularity as @entity7 gifts this year - but @entity9 's @entity8 is no longer the top dog , according to analysts			1
sales of tablets soared nearly threefold this year , with a total of 7.6million units shipped to @entity15 in the first three quarters of 2013 , and a similar number expected to be sold in the @entity7 period			1
but customers may be turning away from the @entity8 , as a host of much cheaper competitors launched on the market this year			1
falling behind ? the @entity8 no longer accounts for a majority of all tablets sold in the @entity15 tablets first hit the mainstream in 2010 when the launch of the @entity8 heralded a lightweight alternative to laptop and desktop computers			1
their sales have continued to rise sharply year on year ever since , with data from analysts @entity35 showing a 192 per cent rise in the number of units shipped from january to september this year			1
the @entity8 was the single most popular device , taking 38 per cent of the market - but for the first time , tablets powered by @entity43 's @entity42 operating system outsold those running @entity9 's @entity46			1
56 per cent of tablets sold in @entity15 run on @entity42 , including popular models such as the @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51			1
the @entity49 and @entity50 are both available for less than £ 200 , compared to a minimum of £ 320 for the @entity53 and £ 400 for the @entity54			0
speeding ahead : the @entity50 , pictured being launched by @entity56 boss @entity55 , is much cheaper nearly 400million apps were downloaded onto smartphones and tablets yesterday thanks to the popularity of mobile devices as @entity7 presents			2
market analysts @entity63 said that december is the peak time for purchases of electronics , and many people 's first instinct is to download as many apps as possible onto their new device			0
software firms released new apps or updated versions of their old apps in time for @entity7 in a bid to take advantage of the boom			0
some companies engaged in more aggressive tactics - @entity56 gave away £ 40 worth of apps to every @entity50 user as part of a @entity7 promotion			0
however , the tablet market has been rocked in recent weeks with the release of even cheaper models by @entity15 retailers not normally thought of as tech giants			0
@entity90 is selling the @entity91 for just £ 119 , in a bid to attract customers who might normally shun tablets as a pricey luxury			2
budget supermarket @entity96 went even further with the @entity97 , which sold out within hours of going on sale for £ 80			2
the rise of ultra-cheap tablets has made parents more likely to give the computers as gifts to their children , according to @entity35 's @entity105			0
' parents looking to give gifts to children and teenagers are unlikely to spend £ 400 - 500 on a tablet , so tablets sub- £ 100 are less of an investment and more of an attractive disposable gift that does n't matter so much if it gets broken , ' he told the @entity114			0
and as the technology which powers tablets continues to get cheaper , budget devices are set to become even more common , the analyst said			2
the rise of cheaper competitors forced @entity9 to introduce the @entity53 last year , and the firm could feel compelled to introduce even more downmarket alternatives to maintain its dominant position .			0

sales of tablet computers *trebled* this year , according to analysts
but only 38 **%** of devices were @entity8 , compared to 56 **%** share for @entity42
budget tablets launched by @entity90 and @entity96 are stealing market share
