by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 admits he will have no excuses if this is another dud @entity5 - a tournament the @entity7 international knows he approaches at the peak of his powers			1
back at @entity12 , the 18 - year - old forward set the world alight with performances that belied his tender years , earning him a place in @entity18 's team of the tournament and a move to @entity21			1
however , @entity2 has frustrated with @entity7 at major tournaments since then and is determined to make amends this summer at what will be his third @entity5			1
there are no such mitigating circumstances this time around , though , and @entity2 is all too aware of the need to impress			1
' i 've been here before and i 've said what i feel i can deliver and what i can do and it has n't happened , ' he said , speaking at @entity7 's @entity44 training camp in the @entity45			1
' i think this is the one where i have to show what i can do			2
i believe i am in the best possible shape and the best condition i can be in to do that			2
' i am ready for it			0
i am excited for it			0
there will be no excuses this time if i do n't perform			1
i certainly wo n't be looking for any excuses this time			2
' asked if he is in a better frame of mind for the exertions brought by a @entity5 , @entity2 added : ' yeah , i am			1
i am settled at home with my family			0
' i have no issues whatsoever and i am ready for this tournament			0
i am going to give everything and leave everything on the pitch			0
' as i 've said before , i wo n't have any excuses this time if it does n't come off			2
keeping fit : @entity2 admits there will be ' no excuses ' if he fails to perform in brazil furthermore , @entity2 is also conscious that , now aged 28 , this summer represents his best opportunity to make a mark at a @entity5			1
' for us , as a nation i think it is the one thing that is missing , ' he said			0
' and then for me personally , i feel the @entity5 in 2018 , i 'll be a bit older then so it will obviously be difficult to impact that the way i believe i can do			0
' so , i feel this is the really last big one that i feel will probably get the best out of me			0
i feel ready , fresh and as good as i can do to go into this tournament			2
' strength : @entity2 ( left ) holds off @entity87 during an @entity7 training session on wednesday relaxed : @entity2 chats with @entity7 captain @entity89 ( right ) ahead of training @entity2 's determination to shine in @entity92 was highlighted last week when he took two fitness coaches on his pre-tournament holiday to @entity95 having missed the last three matches of @entity21 's woeful season			1
that dedication to the cause has been praised by manager @entity100 and has seen the forward able to play a full part in each of @entity7 's training sessions in @entity104 do @entity105 so far			1
' i missed the last few games of the season and i wanted to make sure i was ready and available to train when the team met up , ' @entity2 added			1
' that was the reason behind it			0
happy families : @entity2 kisses his son @entity112 before heading off for training on wednesday ' it certainly helped me get up to speed again and then obviously to join in with the team on the first day , whereas i would have had to do two or three days with the physios and the fitness coaches before i could join in			1
' @entity2 has been impressed by what he has seen from his team - mates so far in @entity122 , with the mixture of wily old - timers and youthful exuberance making him hopeful for a summer to remember			2
' we can go far [ at the @entity5 ] , ' he said			0
' we have got the players and our aim is to win the tournament			0
' we do n't want to be going there saying we would be happy getting to a quarter - final or even a semi-final			0
our aim is to win the tournament - that is what we are preparing for , that is what we hope is going to happen			0
