@entity0 insisted on sunday night that the return of @entity2 to the @entity3 is ' essential ' for the good of @entity6 football			1
the former @entity8 boss reckons the @entity9 have suffered due to a lack of competition in the top flight since their greatest rivals ' liquidation in 2012			0
@entity0 , now in charge at @entity16 , told @entity17 : ' it 's essential for the game in @entity6 that @entity2 get back to the @entity3 as quickly as possible			1
@entity16 manager @entity0 thinks it is essential that @entity2 win promotion back to the @entity6 top flight @entity0 , who managed @entity8 for four years , believes @entity6 football is struggling due to lack of competition ' they are struggling , but new people have come in who i think have the best interests of the club at heart			1
' @entity31 had a fantastic record at @entity33			2
they need to get back to the @entity3 for the state of the game up there – in terms of revenue , crowds , competition			1
' it 's important and i think that 's why @entity6 has struggled			2
@entity8 need it as well – the competition has been missing			0
' @entity0 guided the @entity46 side to the knockout stage of the @entity48 during his four - year spell in the dug - out , but revealed that the overall decline of the @entity3 's financial situation had necessitated the sale of key players			1
@entity54 ( centre ) is congratulated by his team - mates after giving @entity2 the lead away to @entity58 he said : ' it all depends on @entity8			1
when i was there we ended up selling the crown jewels in terms of @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68			0
' it 's very difficult to keep churning out those players , but that was the financial situation			0
there 's no doubt the @entity6 game is significantly weaker			2
' @entity58 , @entity75 and @entity2 are in the @entity76 and they were a big loss in terms of revenue , crowds , quality and competition			1
' it 's lacking at the minute , it 's not in a great state			0
there are seven or eight teams in the @entity3 who have average gates of 4 - 5,000 and with that it 's very difficult to compete with other @entity90 countries			2
' @entity93 slots home to put the game beyond doubt for @entity2 and close the gap on @entity58 @entity0 believes that smaller @entity90 countries may look to combine with their neighbours to create more competitive leagues			1
' there is talk of amalgamating leagues – the @entity104 league , they 're starting to fall behind a bit , but @entity106 have had a resurgence at national level			0
' the @entity109 , as well – you never see any of those teams participating in the @entity48 these days			0
these countries are trying to make a play for having a fair crack of the whip in terms of revenue or even amalgamating some leagues and creating a better standard			0

@entity2 , currently third in @entity76 , beat @entity58 2 - 0 on sunday
@entity31 's side closed gap on @entity58 to three points with game in hand
@entity2 will almost certainly be involved in the promotion play - off
@entity0 thinks it is essential @entity2 get back into the @entity3
