wardrobe malfunction : @entity13 slipped out of her crop top live on @entity10 today over-exposed : the singer was obliviously to her costume disaster unfortunately for @entity13 , she was so immersed in warbling @entity37 that she did n't seem to notice the slip			1
but viewers certainly did - and immediately took to @entity40 to comment on the over-exposure			1
caught on camera : the moment aired live on the @entity30 , but was edited out of broadcasts in other time zones ' two special guests on @entity10 today , @entity13 and her nipple , ' tweeted one user			2
and the @entity1 was quick to blast the tv show , noting that it it could have been avoided if a five - second delay was implemented			1
' for the umpteenth time in recent memory a morning news show has included inappropriate content for children and families , ' @entity1 president @entity52 told @entity58			1
' instead of asking for forgiveness , they need to stop apologizing and implement the five second delay that so many @entity31 have been calling for			2
' a spokesperson for the network insists there is a delay in place , but producers did n't notice the slip - up until it was too late			1
spilling out : the singer 's flimsy outfit failed to contain her cleavage the representative said : ' although we had a five - second delay in place for the @entity13 concert on @entity10 , the live @entity30 feed of the concert regrettably included certain fleeting images of the performer that were taken out of later feeds of the broadcast in other time zones			2
' ' we are sorry that this occurred			1
' @entity13 was wearing a typically outrageous outfit for the performance , which also included a clear , pink - trimmed plastic skirt , leopard print wellies and newsprint leggings			2
her huge yellow hoop earrings were almost as big as her head , as were the multi-coloured bangles she wore			2
loving the attention : @entity13 re-tweeted this complimentary message from a fan after her performance hot pink lipstick , a keyboard ring and a massive head of frizzed - out blonde wig completed her zany look			0
she used a turkey leg as a prop for no apparent reason and took a gigantic , satisfying bite before discarding it			0
she jumped up and down while rapping into her pink , jewel - encrusted microphone while dancers in tutus swirled around her			0
what just happened ? the @entity23 singer looks a little shell - shocked			0
