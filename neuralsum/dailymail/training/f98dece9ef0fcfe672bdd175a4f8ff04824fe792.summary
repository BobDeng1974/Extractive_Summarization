a court heard @entity7 then asked for @entity6 's help , saying he ' had a problem ' but did n't tell him about the murders			1

@entity6 , 57 , denied assisting the offender but was found guilty by a jury at @entity47 last month and was today jailed for two years and nine months			1
judge @entity48 told him : ' i sentence you on the basis , as the jury must have found , that you believed [ @entity52 ] had committed at least one serious offence of violence			2
' i ’m satisfied from the evidence i have heard that you knew it was particularly serious because you know at one stage that @entity21 had her legs bound and that mr @entity7 had on his knee a knife			0
' ' sadistic ' : @entity62 asylum - seeker @entity7 will serve a minimum of 34 years for the murders of @entity15 and @entity16 teenage victims : @entity16 ( left ) , 18 , and @entity15 ( right ) , 17 , were stabbed repeatedly by @entity62 national @entity7 at @entity66 's @entity31 flat the judge described : ' in march last year @entity7 murdered the sister of his then girlfriend			1
he did that in his then girlfriend ’s presence			0
he then forced @entity21 to lure her friend and again in her presence murdered the friend			0
' the evidence clearly shows that after , he had determined to flee the country in an effort to avoid arrest			0
' he took @entity21 against her will , binding her and carrying with him a knife , and they drove to your house			0
' the prosecution do not allege and i do not sentence you on the basis that you know that @entity7 had committed two murders			2
' had you know of the murders the sentence would have been significantly longer			0
' i sentenced you on the basis , as the jury must have found , that you believed he had committed at least a serious offence of violence			0
' you provided him with food , with money , clothing and you went out and bought him a satellite navigation device			0
' horrific ' : @entity52 , left , stabbed @entity15 ( right with her sister @entity21 ) to death at her home in @entity31 while her sister watched helplessly scene : the bodies of murdered teenagers @entity15 and @entity16 were found at @entity109 's flat in @entity31 ' you gave him some advice , i ’m satisfied , as to the method by which he might flee the country on a ferry			1
' once he had left your house there was some contact between you			0
' during the course of the four - day trial , the jury heard distressing evidence from @entity21 , who told how she watched @entity52 spit on her sister @entity21 ’s body before making her lure friend @entity124 to the flat - and brutally knifing her as well			2
after the case , detective chief inspector @entity125 , who led the enquiry to convict @entity52 and @entity6 , said : ' we welcome the sentence of @entity6 today			2
' clearly the court have concluded that he assisted @entity7 following the murder of @entity15 and @entity132 and in in doing so aided him in both escaping from @entity32 and evading the police			2
' fortunately however we were able to apprehend @entity7 before he managed to flee the country to make him answer for truly brutal and horrific crimes			0
' i know the pain and suffering the families of @entity66 and @entity132 have endured has been immense but i hope the conviction of @entity6 today will at least bring them some closure now that the legal process has concluded			0
