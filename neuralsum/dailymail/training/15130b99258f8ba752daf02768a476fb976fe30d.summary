by @entity0 published : 01:50 est , 15 may 2013 updated : 07:23 est , 15 may 2013 locked up : @entity1 , who has been sentenced to 15 years of ' compulsory labour ' by @entity3 for unspecified crimes against the state a @entity6 sentenced to 15 years hard labour in @entity3 has started his sentence at a ' special prison			1
' @entity1 , 44 , was sentenced earlier this month after being detained late last year leading a tour group in the @entity3 city of @entity12 , on the border with @entity14			1
@entity3 's @entity15 accused the missionary of smuggling in inflammatory literature and trying to establish a base for @entity20 activities at a border city hotel			1
@entity22 said earlier this week that @entity23 informed his family on friday that he could n't appeal his april 30 sentence and that he asked his family to urge @entity27 to push for his amnesty			2
@entity27 has called for @entity1 's release			1
@entity3 delivered its most in - depth account yet of the case against mr @entity1 last week , but the long list of allegations included no statement from him , other than claims that he confessed and did n't want an attorney present during his sentencing last week for what @entity22 called hostile acts against the state			1
since the sentencing came during a period of tentative diplomatic moves following weeks of high tension and @entity3 threats of nuclear and missile strikes on @entity27 and @entity51 , outside analysts have said @entity22 may be using @entity1 as bait to win diplomatic concessions in the standoff over its nuclear weapons program			1
@entity3 repeated its denial of such speculation in the new statement , but the pattern has occurred repeatedly			0
tensions : the sentencing of @entity1 will further complicate already strained relations between @entity22 and @entity27			1
@entity3 leader @entity63 ( 3rd left ) is pictured at a soccer match the @entity3 's state media described the statement from an unidentified @entity15 spokesman as a response to @entity72 government and media assertions that the legal case against @entity1 was unreasonable and other claims ' that he was not tried in a transparent manner and ( the @entity76 ) was trying to use this issue as a political bargaining chip			1
' the spokesman said @entity1 could 've faced death but the court reduced the penalty because he confessed			1
@entity1 , a @entity27 state resident described by friends as a devout @entity83 and a tour operator , is at least the sixth @entity72 detained in @entity3 since 2009			1
the others eventually were deported or released without serving out their terms , some after trips to @entity22 by prominent @entity72 , including former presidents @entity89 and @entity91			0
there has been no sign yet of a high - profile @entity72 envoy set to make a clemency mission to @entity3 , which has only recently eased a near - daily , weekslong torrent of threats that followed greater @entity100 sanctions over @entity22 's february nuclear test			0
the @entity76 's statement said @entity1 gave anti-pyongyang lectures in @entity14 and ' infiltrated ' about 250 students into the city of @entity12 , a special economic zone in @entity3 's far northeastern region bordering @entity14 and @entity108			1
it did n't elaborate on the students ' activities , however			0
young leader @entity63 has the power to grant special pardons under the @entity3 's constitution			0
earlier this week , former @entity116 star @entity115 attempted to use his friendship with @entity63 on @entity1 's behalf , asking the leader to ' do me a solid ' and release the @entity72			1

@entity22 has n't responded to @entity115 's appeal on @entity121			0
@entity115 said after his trip to @entity3 that he planned to return in august to vacation with @entity63			0
buds : @entity115 , left , has called on @entity3 's leader @entity63 , right , to release @entity72 prisoner @entity1 ( mr @entity115 with @entity63 in february during his visit to @entity3 ) @entity127 : the former @entity116 star took to @entity121 to send an informal plea to the @entity3 leader the @entity72 has called for the @entity3 to immediately release @entity1			2
it relies on @entity132 diplomats in @entity22 to deal with @entity1 's case because the @entity3 and the @entity72 have had no formal diplomatic relations since the 1950 - 53 @entity135 ended in a truce instead of a peace treaty			2
@entity3 said in the statement that @entity1 ' set up plot - breeding bases in different places of @entity14 for the purpose of toppling ( @entity3 's ) government from 2006 to october 2012 out of distrust and enmity toward the ' country			2
' he committed such hostile acts as egging citizens of ( @entity3 ) overseas and foreigners on to perpetrate hostile acts to bring down its government while conducting a malignant smear campaign against it			0
he was caught red handed			0
' @entity3 refers to @entity1 as @entity155 , the @entity3 spelling for his @entity3 name			2
@entity3 has faced increasing international criticism over its weapons development			0
six - nation disarmament talks involving the @entity161 , the @entity72 , @entity162 , @entity14 and @entity108 fell apart in 2009			0
several rounds of @entity100 sanctions have not encouraged the @entity3 to give up its small cache of nuclear devices , which @entity22 says it must not only keep but expand to protect itself from a hostile @entity27			0
