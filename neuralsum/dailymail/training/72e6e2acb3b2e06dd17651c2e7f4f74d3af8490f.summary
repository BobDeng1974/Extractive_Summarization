by @entity0 published : 04:54 est , 22 august 2013 updated : 12:43 est , 22 august 2013 ousted @entity2 politician @entity1 withdraw a confession of bribery while prosecutors alleged he used his wife and son to help collect more than $ 4 million in illicit funds , as his trial got underway today @entity2 's biggest political scandal in decades			1
court officials released frequent microblog updates on the testimony in an unusual display of openness for a major political trial , suggesting ruling @entity18 officials were confident of minimizing damage from a scandal that exposed a murder and high - level infighting among @entity2 's elite			2
@entity1 denied taking payments from @entity25 , the general manager of an international development corporation in the northeastern city of @entity28 , where @entity1 once held key posts , though he said he had previously admitted to party investigators that he had done so			1
' during the time i was being investigated by the @entity41 , i once admitted to this matter against my will			2
' however , at the time , i had absolutely no knowledge of the nature of the matter , my mind was a total blank			2
' i hope the judge will reasonably and fairly judge , and judge this according to the laws of our country			0
' @entity1 was quoted as saying in one of the @entity56 posts by the @entity57			0
once the powerful party boss in the megacity of @entity60 , the charismatic @entity1 became the most senior leader to fall from power in years after revelations emerged early last year that his wife had killed a @entity66 businessman , making the @entity1 family an international diplomatic liability for the @entity2 leadership			1
escort : the former @entity18 was led into court by two police officers the charges against him include abuse of power in covering up that murder , as well as bribery and embezzlement			0
the accusations appear carefully calibrated to lay blame on the self - serving actions of @entity1 and his family and provide enough culpability to bury his political career , while avoiding allegations that could expose the party 's factional squabbling or show the impunity with which top @entity2 officials operate before they fall from favor			1
prosecutors gave new details of the allegations against @entity1 and his family , including accusations that @entity1 used both his wife , @entity98 , and his son , @entity99 , as intermediaries in accepting more than $ 3 million in @entity28			0
they also alleged that @entity1 instructed an underling to keep quiet a payment to the city of $ 800,000 , and that @entity1 diverted it into personal funds with the help of his wife , according to the @entity107 court updates			0
security : @entity1 was led into court amid tight security at the opening of his trial @entity1 's removal had marked @entity2 's biggest upheaval in the leadership since the violent suppression of the @entity118 pro-democracy protests in 1989			1
@entity1 's revival of the symbolism of @entity122 's radical era had unnerved @entity2 's previous leadership , although current leader @entity124 , installed last fall , has appeared keen to adopt his own brand of @entity122 - like tactics			1
earlier thursday , @entity1 entered the courthouse in a convoy under police escort			0
@entity131 kept far away from the media , some of @entity1 's supporters gathered outside a security perimeter around the court venue , intermittently yelling out ' he served the people ! ' and ' he was a good cadre ! ' the scandal was triggered last year when @entity1 's police chief , a top aide , fled to a @entity142 consulate in a neighboring city , an event that embarrassed the party 's leadership ahead of a key political transition			1
it would later emerge that the police chief had evidence of the @entity152 's murder in late 2011			0
a guilty verdict against @entity1 is all but assured , because the outcomes of high - profile political trials in @entity2 are usually decided by backroom negotiations by politicians and handed down by the court			2
@entity1 's wife confessed to killing @entity160 and was handed a suspended death sentence last year that will likely be commuted to life imprisonment .			0
