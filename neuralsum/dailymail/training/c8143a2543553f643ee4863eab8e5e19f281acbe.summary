scientists working on the most authoritative study on climate change were urged to cover up the fact that the world ’s temperature has n’t risen for the last 15 years , it is claimed			1
a leaked copy of a @entity9 report , compiled by hundreds of scientists , shows politicians in @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and the @entity15 raised concerns about the final draft			1
published next week , it is expected to address the fact that 1998 was the hottest year on record and world temperatures have not yet exceeded it , which scientists have so far struggled to explain			2
the report is the result of six years ’ work by @entity9 ’s @entity28 ( @entity28 ) , which is seen as the world authority on the extent of climate change and what is causing it – on which governments including @entity35 ’s base their green policies			1
concerns : scientists have been urged to cover up the fact that the @entity42 's temperature has n't risen for the last 15 years amid fears it would provide ammunition for deniers of man - made climate change but leaked documents seen by the @entity50 , yesterday revealed deep concerns among politicians about a lack of global warming over the past few years			1
@entity13 called for the references to the slowdown in warming to be deleted , saying looking at a time span of just 10 or 15 years was ‘ misleading ’ and they should focus on decades or centuries			1
the @entity9 's @entity28 has changed its tune after issuing stern warnings about climate change for years @entity14 worried the report would provide ammunition for deniers of man - made climate change			1
@entity12 objected to using 1998 as a starting year for statistics , as it was exceptionally warm and makes the graph look flat - and suggested using 1999 or 2000 instead to give a more upward - pointing curve			2
the @entity15 delegation even weighed in , urging the authors of the report to explain away the lack of warming using the ‘ leading hypothesis ’ among scientists that the lower warming is down to more heat being absorbed by the ocean – which has got hotter			2
the last @entity28 ‘ assessment report ’ was published in 2007 and has been the subject of huge controversy after it had to correct the embarrassing claim that the @entity83 would melt by 2035			0
it was then engulfed in the ‘ @entity92 ’ scandal surrounding leaked emails allegedly showing scientists involved in it trying to manipulate their data to make it look more convincing – although several inquiries found no wrongdoing			0
the latest report , which runs to 2,000 pages , will be shown to representatives from all 195 governments next week at a meeting in @entity100 , who can discuss alterations they want to make			0
but since it was issued to governments in june , they have raised hundreds of objections about the 20 - page summary for policymakers , which sums up the findings of the scientists			2
what it says will inform renewable energy policies and how much consumers and businesses will pay for them			0
the report is expected to say the rate of warming between 1998 and 2012 was about half of the average rate since 1951 – and put this down to natural variations such as the @entity124 and @entity126 ocean cycles and the cooling effects of volcanoes			0
a leaked copy of the @entity9 report , compiled by hundreds of scientists , shows politicians in @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and the @entity15 have raised concerns about the final draft			1
above , the @entity9 headquarters building in @entity136 a @entity13 climate scientist - @entity137 , who reviewed the chapter on sea levels - yesterday admitted it was possible the report ’s authors were feeling under pressure to address the slowdown in warming due to the ‘ public debate ’ around the issue			1
the draft report , which is not new research but a synthesis of all the work being done by scientists around the world , is likely to be highly disputed at the three - day meeting			2
it will make the case that humans are causing global warming with carbon emissions even more strongly upgrading it from ‘ very likely ’ in 2007 to ‘ extremely likely ’ it is manmade			0
but scientists are under pressure to explain why the warming has not exceeded 1998 levels although the decade 2000 - 2010 was the hottest on record			0
@entity166 , of the @entity167 based in @entity168 , said yesterday : ‘ i think to not address it would be a problem because then you basically have the denialists saying : ‘ look the @entity28 is silent on this issue			0
’ @entity173 , a spokesman for the @entity28 said yesterday : ‘ this is the culmination of four years ’ work by hundreds of scientists , where governments get a chance to ensure the summary for policymakers is clear and concise in a dialogue with the scientists who wrote it , and have the opportunity to raise any topics they think should be highlighted			0

leaked @entity9 report reveals the world 's temperature has n't risen for the last 15 years
politicians have raised concerns about the final draft
fears that the findings will *encourage* deniers of man - made climate change
