by @entity0 for @entity1 screen readers for the blind are n’t new , but they typically cost in the region of £ 150 to £ 1,000 ( $ 1,500 )			1
but now a @entity6 firm has developed a screen reading app for @entity9 devices that detects and reads any text aloud , and costs a relatively cheap $ 99 ( £ 60 )			1
the @entity12 app is capable of scanning for text – even within images - and converts it into speech automatically			1
when a user wants to read text , they hold the device above the piece of paper , over the advert or at a shop window , and the app will scan for writing ( pictured left )			2
once it detects text and is in the best position , it takes a photo of it ( pictured right ) the $ 99 ( £ 60 ) app is available for the @entity19 and above , running @entity20 and higher			1

if the app does n't detect any text , or it is n’t in the correct position , it will tell the user to either move the phone or the paper – and it guides the user throughout			0

the app will also import text from images into documents and store them in @entity88 and @entity89			2
in addition , the @entity12 app is compatible with all @entity58 displays supported by @entity59 on @entity20			1
and it does n’t need a web connection to work , meaning it can be used underground and on planes when in airplane mode			0
