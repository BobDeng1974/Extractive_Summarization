@entity0 took another step closer to securing a @entity3 spot as they thumped rivals @entity5 at @entity6 on sunday afternoon			1
@entity8 's side now sit four points ahead of their neighbours and just one point adrift of @entity12 who currently occupy second place in the division			0
here 's how @entity17 rated each player ... @entity0 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) @entity19 6.5 – more effective with his feet than his hands , coming out of his box time and again to clear			2
will be disappointed to let in @entity24 ’s second			2
@entity25 6.5 – @entity27 ’s threat at bay down the right and even switched to the left at one point to stop @entity24 setting up an almost certain goal			2
@entity33 6 – caught ball watching for the first goal and looked ponderous at times , but also made some crucial interception tackles @entity19 celebrates during the @entity39 match between @entity0 and @entity5 @entity33 in action with @entity41 during the @entity43 derby at @entity6 on sunday @entity44 6.5 – selected ahead of @entity45 , made up for his needless red card in the @entity48 derby earlier this season by scoring @entity0 ’s fourth @entity50 blind 6 – got forward well and was involved in two of @entity0 ’s three goals but looked susceptible to the pace of @entity54 on defence @entity56 7 – his calming influence in midfield was so important for @entity0 again , and also produced several timely interceptions			2
@entity60 helps @entity0 take the lead at @entity6 as @entity62 looks on in anguish juan @entity64 – two goals against @entity66 and now one against @entity5 , @entity67 finally looks as though he is settled as a @entity0 player and deserved his standing ovation			1
@entity70 6 – more solid than the eye - catching performances of late , but played his part in maintaining @entity0 ’s midfield dominance			2
@entity60 7.5 – a familiar story for @entity0 ’s unlikely hero			1
@entity5 never really got to grips with his awkward presence and took his goal well			0
@entity81 jumps on top of the @entity84 goalkeeper as @entity0 celebrate at @entity6 @entity85 8 – quick reaction to score @entity0 ’s first goal and provided the deliveries for another two for @entity60 and @entity44			1
@entity85 ’s remarkable renaissance under @entity8 continues			2
@entity81 6.5 – had less impact in a 4 - 1 win than you might have expected but still played a key role for the team and set up the third for @entity67			0
subs : @entity96 , @entity45 ( for @entity33 75 , 6 ) , @entity97 ( for @entity67 , 5.5 ) , @entity101 ( for @entity60 83 , 6 ) , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100			0
scorers : @entity85 , @entity60 , @entity67 , @entity44 booked : none @entity105 midfielder @entity104 takes on fellow countryman @entity41 at @entity6 on sunday @entity5 ( 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 ) @entity62 5.5 – will be unhappy that he allowed @entity60 ’s header to creep past him at the near post but had little chance with the others			1
@entity110 5 – caught out for @entity0 ’s first goal and struggled to get forward as much as usual but set up @entity24 ’s second			1
@entity113 5 – cleared to play despite a hamstring problem but seemed to aggravate it in a rash lunge on @entity117 that could have been a red card			0
subbed at half - time			0
@entity119 and @entity62 celebrate as @entity24 scores at @entity6 @entity119 6 – solid enough despite losing his centre - back partner at half - time and getting an arm in the face from @entity60			1
@entity125 5 – the @entity127 ’s break from deep helped set up @entity5 ’s opener , but it was his man who scored on both occasions as @entity0 surged into the lead			1
@entity41 5 – failed to beat @entity19 with a great early opportunity and continues to lack a cutting edge despite his searing pace			0
former @entity12 defender @entity125 slides in for the ball against @entity0 's @entity85 @entity136 6 – great vision with some of his passing but the big @entity140 is still not imposing himself on games as much as he used to			1
@entity142 5.5 – fantastic early challenge on @entity144 but faded after that as @entity0 came back to take control of the game			0
@entity148 5.5 – skied one attempt into the @entity150 like he was kicking at @entity151			0
a frustrated figure when he was subbed after being fouled by @entity33			0
@entity153 6 – got the assist for @entity5 ’s first goal but outshone by @entity67 and was booked for fouling his @entity105 compatriot out of frustration			0
@entity5 defender @entity158 was booked and subbed as they crashed to defeat at @entity6 @entity24 7 – ca n’t argue with two goals in a derby game away from home but @entity0 were home and dry by the time the second went in			1
subs : @entity166 , @entity167 63 , 6 ) , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 ( for @entity54 , 5.5 ) , @entity173 ( for @entity172 46 , 6 )			0
