male smokers are three times more likely than non-smoking men to lose their y chromosomes , a new study has found			1
the research may explain why men develop and die from many cancers at disproportionate rates compared to women			2
a recent study found an association between y chromosome loss and a shorter life span , as well as a higher risk of multiple cancers			1
besides lung cancer , which is caused by smoking and is often fatal , tobacco smoking is known to be a major risk factor for a range of serious illnesses			0
it is the world 's leading preventable cause of premature death from chronic conditions such as heart disease , strokes and high blood pressure			0
epidemiological data show male smokers have a higher risk of developing non-lung forms of cancer than women who smoke			1
in a study in the journal @entity50 , researchers at @entity47 's @entity46 found that y chromosomes , which are important for sex determination and sperm production , more often disappear from blood cells of smokers than those of men who have never smoked or of men who have kicked the habit			1
since only men have y chromosomes , the finding offers a possible answer to why smoking is a greater risk factor for cancer among men than women			1
women have two x chromosomes ; males have an x and a @entity70 ' there is a correlation between a common and avoidable risk factor , that is smoking , and the most common human mutation -- loss of the y chromosome , ' said @entity79 , an @entity46 professor who worked on the study			1
' this ... may in part explain why men in general have a shorter life span than women and why smoking is more dangerous for men			1
' this discovery could be very persuasive for motivating smokers to quit			0
' besides lung cancer , which is caused by smoking and is often fatal , tobacco smoking is known to be a major risk factor for a range of serious illnesses			0

epidemiological data show male smokers have a higher risk of developing non-lung forms of cancer than women who smoke			1
the team analysed data on more than 6,000 men , taking into account their ages , exercise habits , cholesterol levels , education status , alcohol intake and many other health and behavioural factors			0
besides lung cancer , which is caused by smoking and is often fatal , tobacco smoking is known to be a major risk factor for a range of serious illnesses			0
they discovered that in smokers , the loss of y chromosomes appeared to be dose - dependent -- in other words , men who smoked more lost more -- and that some men who went on to quit smoking appeared to regain their y chromosomes			1
@entity134 , who also worked on the study , said this suggested y chromosome loss due to smoking might be reversible ' this discovery could be very persuasive for motivating smokers to quit , ' he said			1
the scientists are not sure how loss of @entity70 in blood cells is linked with the development of cancer , although one possibility is that immune cells in blood that have lost their y chromosome have a reduced capacity to fight cancer cells			2
' this discovery could be very persuasive for motivating smokers to quit , ' @entity134 , a researcher at @entity151 's @entity46 who led the study , said in a statement			2
the y chromosome is of course the stretch of @entity158 that makes a man			0
women have two x chromosomes ; males have an x and a @entity70 but the y chromosome controls more than the production of male hormones			2
it may affect how the body fights cancer , the @entity151 team said			0
and other studies have shown that men are more likely to get non-lung cancers from smoking than women are â€” from bladder cancer to colon cancer			2
it might be that smoking damages dna in general and that the y chromosome , which is one of the smallest chromosomes in the human genome and already mutation - prone , is just more vulnerable , the researchers say			0
more research is needed to get the answer .			0

male smokers are three times more likely than non-smoking men to lose their y chromosomes , the new @entity47 study has found
recent study found an association between y chromosome loss and a shorter life span , as well as a higher risk of multiple cancers .
