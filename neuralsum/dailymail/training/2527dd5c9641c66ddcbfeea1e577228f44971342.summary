a man was found hidden away friday inside a washing machine after he illegally crossed the @entity3 border into the @entity4 along with four others , who were stowed inside a cardboard box , the man was detained by @entity4 border patrol in @entity8 , @entity9			1
the group was traveling in the back of a u-haul			2
also detained were the man behind the wheel and his female passenger			0
meanwhile , high - ranking @entity24 @entity23 last week called on the @entity26 administration to reverse its new policy of detaining @entity29 immigrant families , warning it could be damaging to the young children being housed in the facilities			0
senate majority leader @entity35 of @entity36 , @entity33 chairman @entity32 of @entity34 and eight other @entity23 wrote @entity38 secretary @entity37 on thursday to complain about the detentions			0
' mothers and their children who have fled violence in their home countries should not be treated like criminals , ' wrote the senators , who also included @entity23 leadership members @entity48 of @entity49 , @entity50 of @entity51 and @entity52 of @entity53			0
the detention policy , which was initiated this past summer as tens of thousands of families and unaccompanied children rushed to the @entity4 border , is part of a broader @entity60 strategy of deterring another influx next year			1
fellow travelers : the man was in the back of a u-haul truck traveling north alongside four other immigrants who were inside a cardboard box many of the migrants are fleeing @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 , where gang violence , drugs and human trafficking are rampant			1
in 2009 , the @entity4 stopped housing newly arrived immigrant families in a troubled @entity9 detention facility			1
instead , the @entity26 administration made less restrictive measures , such as ankle bracelets , telephone interviews and other monitoring programs the centerpiece of its policy for keeping tabs on migrants awaiting court determinations on their status			0
but that changed a few months ago , as president @entity26 was under intense pressure from @entity92 in @entity93 to stop the record numbers of children and families seeking refuge in the @entity4 and arriving without visas			2
he responded by directing the opening of family detention centers , expediting immigration court cases , refusing bond for many of the migrants and working with @entity103 to secure borders			0
