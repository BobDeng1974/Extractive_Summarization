@entity0 insisted he already has ‘ the best group of players ’ with him in @entity9 in an effort to end for good the almost daily saga of @entity3 attempting to keep his name in the @entity6 frame			1
@entity6 ’s new one - day captain again found himself answering questions about the exiled star when he arrived in @entity13 for this morning ’s resumption of hostilities with the old enemy			1
@entity6 suffered problems in making the journey from @entity19 when their flight was cancelled and then when they experienced turbulence on the replacement before @entity0 was given a bumpy ride by the @entity26 press			2
then - @entity6 team - mates @entity0 and @entity3 together at a practice session in @entity29 in 2012 @entity3 has been playing for the @entity30 against the @entity31 in the @entity32 @entity0 ( right ) speaks with @entity33 on thursday during training at the @entity35 @entity0 ( left ) replaced @entity36 as @entity6 's one - day captain shortly before @entity38 @entity3 said @entity0 wanted him back in the @entity6 side in an excruciating ‘ interview ’ with @entity41 during a @entity32 game when the former @entity9 captain took his opportunity to stir the @entity46 pot. but , just as he did in @entity19 on sunday , @entity0 insisted there was no way back for @entity3 when he spoke at the @entity35 before the first one - day international of a tri-series that also involves @entity50			1
‘ i think this is a good opportunity to clear things up given that @entity3 has had a lot of opportunity to talk in the media and get his view out there , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ i ’m very happy with the group of players i have			0
‘ this is the best group of players we have to drive the @entity6 team forward over the next two months in particular			2
@entity3 ’s situation has n’t changed over the last year			0
it ’s been re-iterated over months and days			0
@entity3 is hoping to get back into both the @entity66 and @entity67 teams @entity68 ( left ) speaks to former @entity6 team - mate @entity3 prior to his axe from the international set - up ‘ it was reiterated by the chairman of selectors before @entity38 and i ’m reiterating it again just to clear it up			1
’ certainly @entity3 has done his friend no favours by putting him in a difficult position at a time when @entity0 is trying to prepare for a challenging two months of one - day cricket			1
and the @entity26 have loved keeping the issue in the spotlight			0
but if @entity41 had wanted to do a proper interview , he might have asked @entity85 why he did not play alongside him with @entity86 more often last summer if he truly was serious about playing international cricket again			0
@entity0 refused to answer when asked if @entity6 would be a stronger side here with @entity3 in it			1
‘ i think that ’s a terrible question , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ @entity3 is not in the side , and wo n’t be for the foreseeable future , so there ’s no point answering			0
’ the bottom line is that @entity6 have long since decided to move on without a player who became more trouble than he is worth			0
@entity0 smiles as he waits to bat during a net session as the @entity35 on thursday @entity100 strikes the ball during his record - breaking innings against a @entity103 on wednesday and two half - centuries in an @entity26 @entity106 event does not change that			1
if @entity3 wanted to help his friend as he tries to compete against the two best one - day sides in the world over the next two weeks and then the @entity111 surely he would be better off keeping quiet			1
so will he go easy on @entity0 now ? ‘ i ’ve no idea and it really does n’t bother me either way , ’ insisted the @entity112			0
‘ we ’ve always separated things on the field from things we ’ve done off it and i ’m very comfortable with that			0
’ @entity0 believes @entity6 ’s one - day batting line - up is now the most powerful he has known , as perhaps they began to show while scoring 364 and 391 in their two warm - up games in @entity19			1
‘ certainly that ’s the case in @entity6 teams i ’ve played in , ’ said the man who replaced @entity36 at the helm before this tour			0
@entity6 captain @entity0 shares a joke with his team before posing for a team photo at the @entity35 on thursday the @entity6 team during their official team photo at the @entity35 on thursday : top row - @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity33 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140			1
bottom row : @entity142 , @entity100 , @entity143 , @entity0 , @entity144 , @entity68 and @entity145 ‘ we saw in @entity19 , and at various stages in the past year , that when we perform to our potential we are a dangerous side			2
’ and the man who might have been forced to go into this morning ’s first one - day international without @entity144 as he is nursed back to full fitness is adamant there will be no psychological issues for @entity6 in returning to the scene of their 5 - 0 @entity156 humiliation			1
‘ i think we have a reasonable record home and away against @entity9 in recent years , ’ insisted @entity0			2
‘ the result in the one - day series here last year did n’t really reflect how we played			2
@entity161 and @entity162 in particular were games we would have won in the past , but the guys were low on confidence and we failed to get across the line			0
’ fast - bowler @entity144 is a doubt for @entity6 's odi with @entity9 at the @entity35 on friday			1

@entity6 play @entity9 at the @entity35 on friday
one - day international captain @entity0 will not recall @entity3
@entity3 told @entity172 wanted him in the odi side
@entity0 says he already has ' the best group of players ' available in squad
@entity144 is a doubt for @entity6 's first match with @entity9
