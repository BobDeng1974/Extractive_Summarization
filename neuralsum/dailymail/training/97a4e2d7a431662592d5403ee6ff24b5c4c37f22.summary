although she had £ 1 million in savings , she said the judge 's order would force her to ' downsize ' from her £ 1.75 million west @entity20 home			2
now @entity19 judges have ordered a rehearing of her case , after accepting that she ' arguably ' suffered ' discrimination '			1
@entity34 said it was right that mrs @entity7 should be ' compensated ' for the glittering career she had lost			2
the court heard the couple , both in their 50s , split in 2004 and their divorce was finalised in august the following year			0
mrs @entity7 who appealed a divorce court order that she must sell her £ 1.75m six - bedroom home in @entity43 ( pictured ) to provide herself with an income , arguing that her multi-millionaire former husband should give her ' compensation ' for having ' sacrificed ' her career she was awarded £ 1.37 million of the marital assets and he received about £ 1.2 million			1
mr @entity11 , 54 , also paid his ex maintenance of £ 90,000 - a - year before that was upped by agreement to £ 150,000 in 2007			1
but the court heard he now wants to retire for personal reasons and had asked the family judge to capitalise his wife 's entitlement into a one - off lump sum			0
in march , mr @entity58 rejected mrs @entity7 ' claim for up to £ 2.6 million and awarded her just £ 400,000			2
he said that , together with her savings and the £ 500,000 she could make from downsizing her home , would give her a ' generous ' £ 80,000 - a - year income			1
at the @entity19 , mrs @entity64 ' lawyers argued that was discriminatory and nowhere near enough to compensate her for the loss of her career			2
allowing her appeal , @entity34 said a fresh hearing was needed to ensure a fair distribution of assets between the former couple			0
' to do otherwise is to discriminate against the wife because she is not the income earner ' , he told the court			0
mrs @entity7 , 55 , was once finance director of high - end retailer @entity8 ( pictured ) but gave up the board room for nappy changing forcing her to downsize from her six - bedroom home , in order to boost her income , was ' arguably discriminatory			1
' the ex-couple 's assets , income and needs had to be analysed in a more ' sophisticated ' way to avoid any discrimination against mrs @entity7 , he concluded			0
the dispute was sent back to the @entity91 family division for reconsideration by a different judge			0
1983 : @entity7 , a finance director for department store @entity94 and @entity96 marries accountant @entity11 1989 : mrs @entity7 becomes pregnant and the couple ' agree ' she will give up work			1
2005 : the couple divorce , mrs @entity7 is awarded the £ 1.75million family home , as part of a larger @entity102 2014 : after mrs @entity7 requests a further £ 2.6million from her ex-husband , a the family judge at the @entity91 rules mr @entity11 should pay just £ 400,000			2
he says the £ 400,000 sum , plus money from the sale of the house and interest on her £ 1million savings , would produce around £ 2million - giving her the £ 80,000 - a - year he said she needed to live on			1
october 2014 : at the @entity110 , mrs @entity7 argues she deserves £ 2.2million , in addition to the £ 400,000 , and should be free to keep her house			0
mrs @entity7 ' solicitor , divorce partner @entity113 of @entity114 , said following the decision : ' our client is happy that the courts continue to recognise that she sacrificed her career so her husband could progress with his			0
' she feels it is only right and fair that her compensation should reflect that sacrifice			0
' @entity7 hopes her case will encourage other divorcing spouses in similar circumstances to look closely at their own situation and any offers on the table			0
' we welcome the judgement of the court and the emphasis on the need for courts dealing with cases of this kind to properly address the question of compensation for spouses who have sacrificed careers for the benefit of their families			0
' although @entity11 and mrs @entity7 earned similar salaries , it was she who gave up work to care for the children , now aged in their 20s			2
she had sacrificed ' a serious professional career ' and , although she made a little by working as a counsellor , had a negligible earning capacity after so many years away from the office			0
by contrast , mr @entity11 , as the family 's sole bread - winner , went on to carve out a career as a tax specialist and one of the most successful men in his profession			2
the couple had enjoyed a high standard of living on the husband 's ' very big earnings ' until they split after 21 years of marriage			0
following the divorce , mrs @entity7 received the @entity170 family home , in @entity171 , @entity43 , @entity172 , now worth £ 1.75 million			1
desperate to stay there , she particularly objected to the judge 's view that she should sell it , buy a smaller home and add the capital to her savings pot. mr @entity11 also lives in a £ 1m - plus house in @entity43 , as well as enjoying a holiday home in @entity182 , and the court heard he earned £ 800,000 last year			1
