by @entity0 last updated at 8:07 pm on 25th january 2012 an incredible image of the @entity2 has been taken by a @entity4 telescope in @entity5			0
the @entity4 likened the image to a ‘ celestial firework display ’ , though the nebula is sometimes referred to as ‘ they @entity2 ’ by astronomers			1
the @entity2 is one of the closest and most remarkable examples of a planetary nebula			2
cosmic beauty : an unusual view of the @entity2 taken by the @entity4 's @entity17 telescope in @entity5 it lies in the constellation of @entity20 - about 700 light years from @entity21			1
this picture , taken in infrared light by the @entity4 ’s 4.1 - metre @entity17 telescope at the @entity25 , reveals strands of cold nebular gas that are invisible in images taken in visible light , as well as bringing to light a rich background of stars and galaxies			2
planetary nebulae actually have nothing to do with planets – they are so - named because when they were first discovered in the 18th century they resembled planets when seen through early telescopes			0
they are composed of dust , ionised material and molecular gas that come from a dying star shedding its outer layers			1
this one is evolving to become a white dwarf star and appears as the tiny blue dot seen at the centre of the image			2
@entity52 above : the @entity17 telescope also captured this amazing picture of the star formation region @entity56 8 , often called the @entity57 , last year around it the gas and dust has formed an intricate flower - like pattern , glowing in the fierce glare of ultraviolet light from the central hot star			1
the powerful vision of @entity4 ’s telescope reveals the fine structure in the nebula ’s rings			0
the infrared light picks out how the cooler , molecular gas is organised			0
the material clumps into filaments that radiate out from the centre			0
even though they look tiny , these strands of molecular hydrogen , known as cometary knots , are about the size of our @entity80			0
the main ring of the @entity2 is about two light - years across , roughly half the distance between the @entity84 and the nearest star			1
however , material from the nebula spreads out from the star to at least four light - years			1
this is particularly clear in this infrared view since red molecular gas can be seen across much of the image			0
the molecules in them are able to survive the high - energy radiation that emanates from the dying star precisely because they clump into these knots , which in turn are shielded by dust and molecular gas			1
it is currently unclear how the cometary knots may have originated .			0

the nebula lies 700 light years from @entity21
it 's formed from a dying star shedding its outer layers
