by @entity0 last updated at 9:53 am on 8th july 2011 shamed singer @entity1 has walked free from prison just six weeks into a six - month sentence for drugs charges following the death of a society heiress			1
the @entity8 star has been allowed out on home detention curfew – which will see him wear a tag and confined to his home from 7pm to 7am – after serving only a quarter of his jail term			1
his early release has been branded an insult to the relatives of @entity17 , a member of the wealthy @entity19 family			1
@entity1 was convicted for possessing crack cocaine in a squalid weekend that ended with her fatal overdose			1
mocking : @entity1 wears a judge 's wig outside @entity26 in @entity27 in april before he was jailed and there was further anger yesterday as it emerged the 32 - year - old singer had taunted the family of @entity32 , 27 , calling her filmmaker father , @entity33 , a ‘ deranged old silly ’			1
in a blog posted just hours before he was sentenced on may 20 – his third drug - related jail term – he claimed the society beauty had begged him to inject her with drugs , to sleep with her on acid and to indulge in ‘ black magic sex rituals ’			1
@entity1 uses his self - serving rant to say he refused to allow @entity32 , who idolised him , to use crack or heroin , but admitting he once ‘ banged her up ’ – helped her take drugs – when he found her trying to inject with a blunt needle			1
he said he wanted to make sure ‘ she did it safely ’			1
the former @entity54 frontman also spoke out for the first time about his involvement in the death of @entity58 , 30 , who fell off a balcony in 2006 after being ejected from a party in @entity61 , @entity27 , for belittling @entity1 as a ‘ hyped - up pop star ’			1

he claimed : ‘ she was a heavily involved recreational user and abuser of substances			2
i did not lead her astray at all			2
i left her the day before she died p * * * * * off that i would n’t give her any drugs			1
‘ she asked me for years to inject her , to score for her , to sleep with her on acid , to get into black magic sex rituals … never , never , never			2
’ he went on to abuse her father , saying : ‘ @entity17 ’s father texted me that i am a “ coward and a runt ” and that i am to blame			1
she ( @entity17 ) would be broken hearted if she knew that i was not even invited to the funeral ... she was my best friend you deranged old silly			1
’ in the same blog , the singer also taunted @entity58 ’s mother , @entity99 , about her son ’s death			1

he wrote : ‘ or perhaps , mrs @entity126 , so vocal in her condemnation of me in relation to her son ’s death ... perhaps she ’d be interested to know exactly what occurred that night ? ‘ mrs @entity126 , your son was well liked and well loved			0
the night he died he was intensely agitated ... he was ejected from @entity133 ’s flat because of his aggressive and loud attempts to belittle me and assert his view that i was a hyped - up pop star			1
‘ when he left the flat he was alone and when he fell or jumped he was alone			0
’ earlier this year , after two @entity140 investigations , the @entity138 said there was not enough evidence for a murder prosecution over the death of the @entity146 graduate			0
but last night mrs @entity126 said she was considering a private prosecution against @entity1			0
she said : ‘ if he knew @entity58 was alone , how did he know ? i think it ’s very insulting in a way			0
‘ it ’s a joke			0
it ’s the work of a coward deciding to say something when they are about to go to prison			0
’ and she blasted the decision to release him early , saying : ‘ it feels like a celebrity privilege			0
’ rock : the controversial singer , of @entity160 , @entity161 , has twice been jailed before and has repeatedly admitted possession of class a substances anti-drugs campaigner @entity164 said last night : ‘ it makes it worse for the family of @entity32			0
