the burgundy - coloured splatter would n't look out of place at another of @entity6 city @entity4 ' famed events , a yearly international film festival specialising in horror and fantasy			1
but there 's nothing to fear about this @entity12 , which ran on sunday as part of the 53rd @entity14 , or @entity15 , which celebrates the annual harvest			1
the squishing of grapes in front of a historic church has been a pivotal part of the @entity24 festival 's programme for 36 years as groups of locals ditch their shoes and produce the raw material for their signature drop			2
the @entity31 region produces about 90 per cent of the world 's cava and while not all of the grapes are squashed in this ancient manner , the locals are certainly adept at extracting all of the juice possible from their grapes			2
teams compete with a duo together in a wooden half barrel doing the stomping - otherwise known as the fun bit - while another member squeezes the crushed grapes with their hands over a wire mesh to ensure every last drop of the previous liquid is liberated			0
the winning team is simply the one to produce the most juice			0
potentially not the most politically correct of festivals , other events include a beauty competition and the weighing of the heir and heiress of the event using wine bottles			0
