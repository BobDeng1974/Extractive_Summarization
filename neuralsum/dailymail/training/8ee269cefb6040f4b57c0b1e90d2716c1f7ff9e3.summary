a customer who rented a car for a one - day trip in @entity3 wound up with a $ 3,374 bill thanks to a blown tire , while another was hit with a $ 780 charge for a broken bumper he had no idea about			1
a third was charged an extra five days in rental fees after bringing her car back after - hours - because they say it took them that long to find the vehicle			2
the fat fees are cautionary tales against straying from the fine print in rental agreements , which can lead to huge fines for what seem like minor offenses			0
rough ride : @entity28 's ride from @entity29 , @entity3 , to @entity30 almost cost him $ 3,374 @entity28 , the driver whose flat tire struck at the worst possible time , had banked on paying @entity33 just $ 96 for his trip from @entity29 , @entity3 , to @entity30 , where he was due to catch a plane			1
but , according to @entity36 , @entity28 found himself with a flat - and no spare - while he parked in @entity37 within @entity30 he tried to summon the company 's assistance vehicle and drive off in another car - but the company said the rescue would take so long he 'd miss his flight home to @entity45			1
so instead he called @entity33 and asked to leave the car where it was for them to pick up , while he headed off himself			0
claims : @entity28 thought @entity33 had taken back responsibility for a car after he left it in a military base after a tire blew - but they could n't reach it for weeks , and charged him do n't be late : another driver from @entity57 , @entity58 ( pictured ) was charged $ 785 for a broken bumper that was n't there when he dropped off his car but when the tow truck arrived , after @entity28 had set off , it was n't allowed on base and was kept away for weeks - resulting in the huge fee for him			1
in another case , a 33 - year - old man from @entity57 , @entity58 , took an @entity69 car back after business hours , assuming he would be charged the regular fee - or for a late return at worst			1
but instead he was contacted by the company saying the car had been ' rear - ended ' while technically in his possession - and sent photos of the vehicle with a mangled bumper			1
he was hit with a $ 785 charge to cover the repairs , because the vehicle was his responsibility until it had been officially given back			0
a further , unnamed woman was hit with five extra days of fees on her rental after returning a car at 3am			0
the rental company said they took five days to locate the car , all of which she had to pay for			2
a rental industry spokesman said it was the consumer 's responsibility to protect themselves from accidents - and make sure their agreements are honored			0
the representative , for the @entity97 , said : ' the rule of thumb is that the unit you rented is still on rent and is your responsibility until the office opens and the car is inspected			0
if damage is found at that time , the renter is charged			0
' although after vigorous complaints , @entity28 and the @entity58 resident had their jumbo charges waived , experts warn that unless renters stick to the small print religiously , they could be next .			2
