it is not often that skyscrapers double up as theme park rides - but this new design for a building in @entity5 is breaking the mold			1
plans for the unusual @entity8 have just been approved , combining two thrilling rides with a building that looks like a giant slide			1
the £ 262million ( $ 428million ) construction is set to become an icon in the @entity14 as @entity5 's tallest building , standing at 1,000ft high - and has already been dubbed ' @entity5 's @entity16 '			1
thrillseekers will be able to indulge in @entity38 , and experience that allows people to base jump off the skyscraper attached to a ' high - speed controlled - descent wire '			2
and if that is n't enough , they will also be able to try @entity45 , being locked into a harness before freefalling 50 stories			0
an exclusive club and a bar will cater for adults wand the @entity51 will provide additional entertainment			0
the @entity53 will be the height of exclusivity for the vibrant @entity5 and @entity57 club scene being 1,000ft up while a fine dining restaurant will have the same views a floor down in a more subdued setting			2
before : the area in @entity5 where construction has been approved for @entity8 decked out : the top of @entity8 where three observation decks , bars and restaurants will be found sense of place : the tower will rise out of @entity5 and overlook @entity57 and the city for the rides , @entity38 is essentially a base - jumping experience with a high - speed controlled - descent wire system instead of self - activated parachute			1
the second ride , @entity45 , will see visitors strapped into a harness and sent into a 50 - storey drop before a rapid deceleration keeps them from the ground			0
finally , the @entity51 is a motion - based simulator similar to soaring at @entity84 ’s @entity83 .			0

@entity8 will be *completed* in 2017 , standing 1,000ft tall
unusual building has been dubbed @entity5 's @entity16
rides will allow people to base jump from the top of @entity5 's tallest building
