by @entity0 and @entity1 letting out a mighty roar after scoring a goal , this was @entity5 ’s blue - haired wheelchair rugby player @entity2 in action last night			1
a capacity crowd of 10,000 cheered on @entity2 and the rest of the team as they took on reigning champions @entity12 in the fast and furious sport once known as ‘ murderball ’			1
the crowd ensured an electric atmosphere for the eagerly awaited tournament launch of a sport that can feature ferocious clashes between players			0
war cry : @entity5 's @entity2 ( left ) celebrates after scoring past @entity22 ( right ) of the @entity12 no holds barred : @entity23 of the @entity12 is up - ended during the wheelchair rugby match against @entity5 at the @entity25 violent collisions saw players go flying , prompting the commentator to shout : ‘ what a hit ! ’ regular stops in play allowed a team of helpers to sprint from the touchline and right upended chairs , caused by tough tackles			1
the huge hits , met with gasps and groans from the crowd , could be heard high up in the packed stadium , and left stricken players prone on the floor			0
there were also regular pauses for chairs to undergo a mid-court ‘ pit stop ’ as damaged wheels were replaced			0
the gb team put on a brave display but eventually lost 56 - 44 in their pool match			1
fast and furious : @entity52 of @entity5 with the ball during @entity55 's opening pool match it 's called ' murderball ' for a reason : @entity55 's @entity58 ends up flat on his back in a typically aggressive encounter against the world number one side captain @entity64 ’s team are widely viewed as strong medal contenders , and they led 13 - 11 after a fierce opening quarter at the @entity25			1
despite a 16 - goal display from star performer @entity52 and an 11 - goal contribution by @entity2 , however , they could not hold off the challenge of the @entity72 champions			2
@entity73 are next up tonight , followed by @entity74 tomorrow , with successive victories certain to secure semi-final status			0
@entity64 said : ‘ the states are number one in the world , so it was never going to be easy			1
' we had the bounce of the ball sometimes , and other times it went against us			0
that crowd was something else			0
' you have to draw from the crowd and find that extra percentage with your performance			0
’ crash , bang , wallop : will @entity23 goes flying after being knocked over by @entity5 's @entity52 ( left )			1
heavy contacts are actively encouraged in the sport eyes on the ball : @entity5 's @entity2 ( left ) and @entity97 ( right ) close in on @entity98 of the @entity12 doing it for the girls : @entity5 's only female player , @entity101 , proves murderball is not just a man 's world as she tackles a @entity12 opponent not for the faint - hearted : @entity12 's @entity23 is picked up after falling during the @entity107 match at the @entity25 in @entity108 @entity101 , 24 , the only female player in @entity5 ’s ranks – and one of only two in the tournament – added : ‘ we came out really strong			1
’ tickets for the @entity115 sold out , with the @entity55 chef de mission @entity116 describing it as a ' tough , fast game played with no fear and plenty of clashes '			1
so many clashes , in fact , that there is a team of welders on standby at the sidelines , ready to repair players ' wheelchairs			2
the 11 - strong @entity55 squad is a young team , with only three players having taken part in both @entity133 and @entity134 and are hoping for their first @entity55 medal			1
before today 's game , captain @entity64 said the team strongly wants to win a medal , in the strategic game he describes as being similar to chess			1
but he stressed : ' there is no added pressure			0
i am not thinking about the history			0
' he added that it was a ' buzz ' to play in front of sell - out crowds			2
after today 's opener , @entity5 play @entity73 tomorrow evening , then @entity74 on friday			1
both semi-finals are on saturday , with the final one of the @entity72 ' last events next sunday afternoon			0
the game was invented in the 1970s by athletes with quadriplegia wanting an alternative sport to wheelchair basketball , but it was not until 1989 that the first international tournament was held			0
@entity5 was among the three teams taking part in @entity161 , @entity162			1
can barely watch : the @entity163 and an aghast @entity164 get into the action at the match agony to ecstasy : the countess celebrates as @entity55 score in what was a close but ultimately disappointing result for the home side tipping point : @entity55 's @entity64 desperately tries to stay upright in the heat of battle just out of reach : the @entity178 team gave it their all but came up short against the @entity12 crunching : @entity5 's @entity181 and @entity64 crash into @entity12 opponent @entity23 as if being the only female member of the @entity178 wheelchair rugby team was not enough to make @entity101 , above , stand out , she has also had a @entity185 shaved into the side of her bright red hair			1
the 24 - year - old put in an impressive performance when the @entity55 team faced the @entity12 , ranked number one in the world , in the opening match of the competition this afternoon			1
she is only the second woman to play with the @entity178 team at @entity72 level			2
@entity101 , who lives in @entity196 , @entity197 , took up the sport two years ago after an accident which left her paralysed from the chest down			0
she lost a £ 6million damages claim at the @entity202 last year over the injury , which happened when she hit her head on the bottom of a swimming pool as a teenager in 2006			2
@entity101 knew that she ' wanted to continue playing sport and as soon as she saw her first game of wheelchair rugby , she says she knew it was the sport for her ' , according to the @entity55			1
it first appeared at a @entity72 in 1996 as a demonstration sport , making the @entity214 games the first time it was given full medal status			2
wheelchair rugby is played indoors on a basketball court , with mixed teams of four players who use a white ball , similar to a volleyball			0
to score a goal , an athlete has to pass the opposing team 's goal line while in firm control of the ball , with two wheels of their chair crossing the line			1
the ball has to be passed or dribbled every 10 seconds and is passed to the other side if that does not happen			2
there are four eight - minute quarters to each game			2
while there is contact between the chairs , penalties are incurred if physical contact is made with an opponent or if an opponent 's chair is hit behind the rear wheel			2
athletes are classified with a points system , on a scale from 0.5 to 3.5			0
their team of four athletes on court at any one time can not exceed a total of 8.0 points in total unless there is a woman in the team , in which case they are allowed an extra 0.5 points			0
those with the highest level of impairment are classified as 0.5 players and along with the 1.0 players , can not easily pick up or pass the ball , making them more suited to being blockers			0
those with a rating of 3.0 or 3.5 have a high degree of strength and stability as well as higher functionality in their upper limbs			0
currently , the sport is dominated by the @entity12 and @entity162 teams			1
melee : @entity55 player is hurled out of his chair after a shuddering collision damaged : contact between chairs is not only allowed , it is positively encouraged bidding for the podium : the 11 - strong @entity55 squad is a young team , with only three players having taken part in both @entity133 and @entity134 , and are hoping for their first @entity55 medal high - flier : @entity5 's @entity97 throws the ball over @entity290 murderball was given its name by the devil - may - care quadriplegics who invented the game during the late seventies			1
it was also the title of a 2005 documentary starring @entity12 player @entity300 , about teams competing at the previous year ’s paralympics in @entity134			2
the sport - otherwise known as wheelchair rugby - was invented by a group of @entity162 who met in rehab and whose disabilities were so severe that they could n’t participate in wheelchair basketball			0
brutal : murderball was popularised in a 2005 documentary starring @entity12 player @entity300 ( right ) about the sport during the @entity313 a year earlier searching for an outlet for their machismo , they found slamming into one another like wheel - propelled warriors exhilaratingly therapeutic			1
sparks visibly fly as aluminium wheels are deliberately jammed by nasty devices ( called ‘ spikes ’ ) attached to the front of some chairs			0
attackers attempt to force the ball over the goal - line with the aid of battering rams , with the barging is so ferocious that players are frequently thrown from their seats , sometimes breaking fingers and arms			0
the sport soon became popular across the border in the @entity12 , and in the @entity338 reached @entity339 in @entity5			1
it has rapidly evolved , at the elite level , into a strategic game likened to fast - moving human chess			0
though the @entity178 hq is at @entity346 and the aim is to get the ball — round not oval — across a goal - line , it bears little resemblance to rugby .			0

home nation *outscored* world number one in first quarter of pool match
but could *n't* cope with @entity12 side 's passing and movement to lose 56 - 44
young team are hoping to land @entity5 's first @entity55 medal
