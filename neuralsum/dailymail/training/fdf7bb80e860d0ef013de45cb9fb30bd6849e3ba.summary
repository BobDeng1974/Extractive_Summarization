as the refereeing fraternity comes under increasing pressure , @entity0 reveals the shocking disparity between the wages earned by @entity6 officials and those who work more in the @entity7			1
@entity9 referees — operating mostly in the @entity6 — are believed to earn a basic salary of around £ 65,000 per year , while they also receive fees in excess of £ 1,000 per game in the top flight			1
if they were to officiate 38 games in a season , it would bring their overall pay to more than £ 100,000			0
referees on the @entity20 — operating in the @entity7 — are not on contracts and are paid in the region of £ 380 a match			1
they sign up to the @entity20 on the equivalent of a freelance basis			1
if they were to officiate the 46 games in a @entity7 season , they would receive £ 17,480			1
@entity31 referees like @entity32 ( centre ) can earn up to £ 100,000 per year in wages referees lower down the football food chain earn far less , with potential earnings of around £ 17,000 per year assistant referees on the @entity39 are paid as little as £ 185 per match while fourth officials receive £ 110			1
so an assistant referee in the @entity43 would receive only £ 8,510 for a 46 - game season but no retainer in the summer months			0
in many cases , it will be less because assistant referees are not guaranteed a game in the @entity7 every week and will also combine fourth - official duties and officiating in @entity51 games			2
one assistant estimated that his yearly earnings would be closer to £ 5,000			0
there is also no sliding scale between the @entity43 and @entity56 and @entity0 ’s calculations demonstrate that there could , in theory , be an £ 80,000 gap in pay between refereeing regularly in the @entity6 and the @entity43			2
@entity7 officials tend to work on a freelance basis meaning it is harder to get regular work the @entity9 and @entity20 fall under the jurisdiction of the @entity67 ( @entity67 )			1
the organisation declined to comment on the chasm in wages but they take the view that the rates differ between contracted workers and freelance employers as they would in any other industry			0
it means that most @entity20 officials have a job and referee as a hobby and one source admitted that there have been occasions when they have seen officials ‘ extremely tired ’ after working a five - day week and then refereeing			0
the @entity67 ( @entity67 ) refused to comment on the huge wage disparity the lower pay in the @entity7 is thought to be one reason why there are so few good referees coming through the system			1
it is also hard to dislodge the top - flight referees , who are determined to stay where they earn the big money			2
the @entity7 say it is an ongoing debate as to whether more officials should be made professional			2
the wage discrepancy represents a fresh blow to the credibility of the @entity67 after a festive period that saw a litany of errors by @entity6 referees			0
it led @entity0 columnist @entity106 to call for the sacking of @entity108 , the head of the @entity67			0
the @entity67 has been under fire from critics following a string of refereeing errors over the festive period			0

@entity0 reveals the huge wage disparity between football referees
@entity31 officials can potentially earn up to £ 100,00 per year
@entity7 referees earn a measly £ 380 per match on equivalent of a freelance basis
