a mother has warned parents of venomous spiders after her daughter , four , was bitten in her bedroom and left with a swollen leg and red rash which spread over her body			1
@entity9 , 38 , called paramedics after a red patch on her daughter @entity3 's body began to spread from her leg to her stomach and neck , her foot ballooned and she developed a fierce temperature			1
doctors have confirmed that a spider was responsible , and ms @entity9 says she has no doubt that @entity3 was bitten by one of the ' huge ' creatures she has seen at her home in @entity23 , @entity24			1
' but because they come into the house from outside , there is not a lot we can do			2
i do n't want the same happening to them			0
' in recent weeks a number of larger than normal spiders have been spotted across the country as the warm summer has meant the spiders have had more to eat , and have not been killed off by falling temperatures			1
ms @entity9 and her partner @entity52 had noticed the rash on @entity3 's body on sunday afternoon , and called for an ambulance			1
' i want to make parents aware that a simple insect bite can have serious consequences , ' she said			0
' i was horrified as the rash spread			1
it looked like she 'd been severely scalded			0
they were just like burn marks			0
' suffering : @entity3 , who was forced to pull out of her first full day primary school on monday , had woken up with a livid red patch on the top of her leg @entity3 , who was forced to pull out of her first full day primary school on monday , had woken up with a livid red patch on the top of her leg			1
within hours , it had spread over her body , and her temperature was rising			1
her parents took the child to a walk - in medical centre where staff discovered a bite was to blame and prescribed a course of tablets			0
however , the medication did nothing to stem the rash and when it moved to @entity3 's neck paramedics were called			1
ambulance staff helped make @entity3 comfortable , but she did not need to go to hospital			2
' at first we thought @entity3 had been bitten outside , but i 've seen some very large spiders in her bedroom and wonder if one of those attacked while she was asleep			1
' @entity91 may not be noted for its dangerous creatures , but is home to 14 spider species that can deliver a painful bite			2
most venomous is the false widow , which has moved to this country from abroad , but bites from cupboard , woodlouse , lace weaver , black lace weaver , wolf , bark sac , stone , cross , money and wasp spiders can also be painful			2
to blame ? the family suspect that @entity3 was attacked by a giant house spider , similar to the one pictured , which are common visitors to homes in autumn and often found in baths the family suspect that @entity3 was attacked by a giant house spider - a common visitor to homes in autumn and often found in baths			1
they can grow to five inches and possess a potent venom , but do not usually strike			0
spider expert professor @entity121 explained the surge in sightings			2
' this year has been seemingly a good one for the invertebrates which spiders feed on , and it 's quite mild out there , ' he said			1
but he stressed the spiders do more good than harm , providing a free pest control service			2
' they often feed on the most common species , preventing a few species from becoming dominant , ' he said			0
' we want to encourage people to respect and learn more about their little house guests			2
' there are three types of allergic reactions to stings or bites : minor localised , large localised and systemic			0
the latter is potentially life - threatening			0
' if you have a large localised reaction after being bitten or stung by an insect , a large area around the bite or sting will swell up , ' said an @entity150 spokesman			0
' the area may measure up to 12 inches across , or your entire arm or leg could swell up			0
' the swelling will usually last longer than 48 hours , but should start to go down after a few days			0
' you ’re more likely to have a systemic reaction if you ’ve been bitten or stung before and become sensitised , particularly if it was recently			0
