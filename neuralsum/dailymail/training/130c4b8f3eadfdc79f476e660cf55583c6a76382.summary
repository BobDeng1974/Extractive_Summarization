@entity0 is going ahead with plans to dump more than half of its life rafts from @entity5 737 planes to save money on fuel consumption			1
the airline , which will start making the changes this week , says ' it is about being smarter ' and has denied the move will make the planes less safer			2
half the planes in the 72 batch fleet will have the life rafts removed			1
they are flights which do not fly over long stretches of water and only go between @entity21 capital cities			0
@entity0 fitted all their @entity5 with life rafts in the nineties but are now removing the rafts from the half the fleet which do n't travel over water @entity27 , a spokesman for @entity0 , explained that the airline had life rafts fitted to all the 737 's in the 1990 's to avoid the time and difficulty for engineers involved in loading rafts on and off planes			1
before that the life rafts were put in manually depending on whether the planes were flying over water or not			2
she said the new approach was ' about being smarter ' and it would help save money on fuel consumption as the planes would be lighter			1
@entity42 , @entity0 ’ head of safety , explained the planes that do n't fly over water do n't need the rafts @entity42 , @entity0 ’ head of safety , said : ' the majority of our @entity5 737s operate between @entity21 mainland cities and do n’t fly over long stretches of water , so rafts simply are n’t required even as a precaution			1
' this approach is the midpoint between two policies we ’ve had in the past , which saw us taking rafts on and off as needed or keeping them on every aircraft no matter where it was flying			0
' our 737s that fly over long stretches of water will continue to be fitted with life rafts – for example @entity64 flights that go to @entity65			2
' the simple rule of thumb is that all @entity0 aircraft that need to carry life rafts , which is all of our international aircraft and about half of our @entity72 , will have them onboard			1
' ' we would never implement any change that would compromise @entity75 ’s and @entity0 ’ strict safety standards			0
' the move , which applies to planes that travel less than 400 nautical miles out to sea , has attracted criticism from ­ independent senator @entity80 and some @entity0 pilots and crew			1
@entity0 says the new move is about maintaining a ' high level of safety while being smarter ' senator @entity80 called for the airline to abandon the plan after hearing safety concerns from staff that people could die of hypothermia if a plane went down over water within the limit , reported the @entity21			1
mr @entity42 added : ' this is about us maintaining @entity0 ’ high level of safety while being smarter with the way we operate our flights			0
' in the past we installed life rafts on all our @entity5 ’s , even if they did n’t operate over water			2
' now , we are separating them into two categories – ones that fly over water and ones that do n’t – and allocating them appropriately			0
' similar plans are being implemented by competitor @entity109 and six @entity112 aircraft			0
@entity75 said the @entity0 decision was in accordance with international rules incorporated into @entity21 ’s air - safety regulations			0
a spokesman told the @entity21 “ these international stand ­ ards permit flights out to 400 nautical miles or 120 minutes ’ flight time , whichever is less , from land without the carriage of life rafts for certain aircraft			0

@entity0 will start removing half the life rafts from its fleet of @entity5 planes this week
the airline does n't need to have the rafts fitted on planes which do n't travel over water
the move has been *backed* by the @entity138 and will save money on fuel consumption
the plan has been criticised by independent senator @entity80 and some @entity0 staff
@entity0 ' head of safety says airline would ' never implement ' changes that would compromise safety
