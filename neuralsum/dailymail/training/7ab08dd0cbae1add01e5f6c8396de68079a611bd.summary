the issue of small fields rears its ugly head again with saturday 's @entity3 attracting just four runners			1
thankfully , there are a couple of decent handicaps on the @entity9 card for punters to attack and @entity12 ’s wishes ( @entity9 , 1.50 ) could be the answer to the @entity14			1
the 10 - year - old defends his crown on saturday having landed the last running of this event two years ago and his two runs this season have indicated he is being primed for a repeat bid			1
@entity9 plays host to the @entity3 on saturday afternoon for @entity24 's wishes a tidy comeback behind @entity26 over hurdles precluded a very fair performance in the @entity29 which saw the selection beaten just 14 lengths by dodging @entity32			1
while it is dangerous to take that run too literally , it did at least confirm @entity36 is in excellent heart and his last two runs in handicaps resulted in two decisive victories , including in this race in 2013			0
there looks a good chance of a decent gallop , too , with the likes of mr @entity47 and @entity48 in opposition and that should aid a horse who traditionally travels strongly			0
the likeable @entity53 is likely to be a fairly short - priced conveyance for the @entity55 following a couple of facile victories			2
however , there could be some margin in supporting @entity61 ’s cracked it ( @entity9 , 2.25 ) , who has impressed in both his starts this term and may offer a better - value wager			1
any overnight rain — there is eight to 10 millimetres forecast — would play to the strengths of @entity70 ’s charge who hails from a yard in rampant form			0
@entity74 ’s cracked it clearly loves racing right - handed too and , but for a sloppy leap at the final two flights at @entity78 last time , would have won considerably more easily			0
connections have had this race in mind for some time , while it appears an after - thought for the favourite and only other serious rival @entity84 , who bids to give trainer @entity86 his first @entity88 winner			0
grade one @entity3 winner last year , @entity36 , leaps a hurdle at @entity91 in november 2014 there is some excellent fare on the all - weather and @entity95 ( @entity96 , nap , 1.25 ) could trump his rivals in the mile handicap			1
a narrow defeat of the talented @entity104 over course and distance reads well in the context of today ’s event and @entity107 , who was back in eighth , was only narrowly touched off on wednesday at a big price			0
the stop - start nature of a four - runner conditions race did n’t suit last time and @entity112 should go well back in a handicap on saturday			2
@entity114 ( @entity96 , nb , 2.00 ) was another undone by a sluggish gallop last time and appears a fair bet to go a couple better with some front - runners in opposition saturday afternoon .			2

@entity24 's wishes will defend his crown at @entity9 on saturday
