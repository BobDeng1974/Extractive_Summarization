but mr @entity7 cast doubt on the girls ’ account , claiming they knew exactly what they were doing and had plenty of chances to ‘ walk away			1
’ ‘ i told them not to get involved , ’ he said			1
‘ they were girls who hung around people with money in villas			2
‘ and then somebody made them a good offer and they went and did it			0
‘ everyone is out there with no money , trying to make money and they obviously got an incentive to do it			2
’ miss @entity9 ’s lawyer , @entity67 , has repeatedly stressed that the women were not offered money at any stage			1
however , mr @entity7 , who did not know miss @entity9 personally , but was aware of her circle of friends , added : ‘ they made a choice			1
there were plenty of chances they had to stop and walk away			0
' they are going to have a hard time , are n’t they ? tough on them			0
all of these girls are just money hungry			1

mr @entity7 , who claims he has left his criminal past behind , told the @entity107 newspaper : ‘ i had no connection whatsoever with this happening to the girls , only that i told them not to do it			2

‘ they were found to have drugs on them			2
they collected packages which transpired to be drugs			0
they are going to be guilty of that			0
‘ if that ’s the @entity30 law , regardless of the mitigating circumstances , then you are as well pleading guilty rather than defending that to the nth degree and be sitting there with 15 years that you ’re trying to appeal and reduce			1
‘ these girls are young			0
they may be living in cloud cuckoo land and thinking that magically next week they ’re going to go free			0

‘ but two girls , who prior to @entity15 did not know each other , are telling a very similar story , ’ he said			0
‘ they have been pretty consistent all along			0
only those two girls know the truth			0

they could be sentenced to 15 years in prison if found guilty
