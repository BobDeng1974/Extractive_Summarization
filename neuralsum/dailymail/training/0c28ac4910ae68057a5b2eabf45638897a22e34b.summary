some 44 per cent of adults believe it was a mistake for the party to go into @entity41 with the conservatives in 2010 and 42 per cent feel betrayed by @entity5			2

he told @entity32 's @entity72 : ' ' i 've literally lost count of the times , with the greatest respect , that i 've been asked questions saying ' oh is n't it going to be a disaster ? are n't you going to be wiped out ? is n't it all going to be terrible ? ' and every time we confound the sceptics and i genuinely think we will do so next year			2
' not because i 'm being somehow naïve about this – of course this has been tough for us over the last few years			0
' but because i experience this in my own constituency in south - west @entity89 – and speaking to my friends and colleagues here , we all experience the same – when we get out and tell our side of the story and say that it 's because of us the economy is now growing again			0
' it 's because of us people have got more money in their pockets because we 've given fair tax cuts to people on low and middle incomes , it 's because of us there are more apprenticeships than ever before , it 's because of us the state pension has gone up by the largest cash terms ever , and so on and so forth – the more we explain our side of the story and what we 've done in government , the more we do get people to support us in those areas where we are competing for those votes			0
and that 's what we need to do between now and the next general election			0
' i 'm not a soothsayer or a pollster so you 'll need to speak pollsters and soothsayers about what they think the future will hold			0
all i can tell you is what i believe , what our values are and the pride that i have in what we 've done over the last four and a half years			0
' @entity5 changed into casual chinos and a dark shirt for a q&a at the @entity2 conference in @entity19 this afternoon party activists appeared less than enthralled by the day 's debate at the @entity135 on the banks of the @entity137 delegates listen to speakers at the @entity2 @entity141 conference - the last before may 's general election however , mr @entity5 's main conference slogan has been ridiculed by former @entity2 minister @entity14			1
he branded the party the political equivalent of struggling supermarket chain @entity16			2
mr @entity14 said the party 's positioning showed a ' fundamental misunderstanding ' of the current political reality and mocked the @entity2 ' ' stronger economy , fairer society ' conference slogan , repeatedly used by mr @entity5 in broadcast interviews			1
voters will not be won over by a party that makes reining in others and banning things its main pitch , he told the @entity160 conference fringe			1
he said : ' our slogan really is stronger economy , invisible brackets , than you would get if @entity57 was in government on their own , close invisible brackets			0
fairer society , open invisible brackets , than you would get if the @entity171 were in government on their own , close brackets			0
' ' so , the very slogan of our conference is about how we would aspire to mitigate others in government , that our raison d'etre in politics is not to advance our our ideas but to retard the advancement of other people 's ideas and that we will , quotes , anchor them in the centre ground , i.e. , make sure people who believe something ca n't put actually put their beliefs forward unimpeded			0
' it feels to me like we are pursuing a second vote strategy in a one preference voting system			0
' he added : ' i think we need a message , i do n't just mean in this election but for the next 10 years , about what we believe in , what do we stand for as a party			0
' while @entity58 and the @entity201 are like @entity202 and @entity203 , the @entity2 are like @entity16 , he said			2
' the @entity2 are the @entity16 of our day			2
we have to think what are we offering the customers that goes beyond those who shop at @entity16 out of habit or because it is the nearest to their home			0
' ' at the moment we are heavily reliant on habit and geographic proximity			0
