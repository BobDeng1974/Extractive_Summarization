by @entity0 published : 05:30 est , 21 august 2012 updated : 08:14 est , 21 august 2012 after driving all around @entity2 with four rovers , @entity1 wants to look deep into the guts of the red planet			1
the space agency has decided to launch a relatively low - cost robotic lander in 2016 to find out what makes the @entity2 core so different from @entity10			2
the insight project was chosen by @entity1 's @entity13 programme over missions to a @entity15 moon and comet , drawing complaints from scientists that it is too focused on @entity2			1
the insight mission includes two instruments , one @entity33 and one @entity34 , that will examine the geology of @entity2 in depth , exploring the core 's size , composition and temperature			0
the @entity41 will look deep into the guts of the red planet in 2016 @entity2 's interior is a mystery			1
it has no magnetic field , and scientists are unsure whether its core is solid or liquid or if it has frequent quakes like @entity10			0

' what kind of @entity2 quakes are there ? how big is the core of @entity2 ? does it have remnants of a molten core like the @entity10 does ? ' asked the discovery programme chief , @entity67			0
@entity68 of @entity69 said geologists have been asking for this type of crucial information for decades and said a project like this was overdue			0
the mission will be run by @entity1 's @entity77 in @entity78 , which is basking in the success of the $ 2.5bn ( £ 1.6bn ) @entity80 , which is starting to explore the planet 's surface after landing this month			1
earlier this year , @entity1 pulled out of two @entity2 missions with the @entity84 because it lacked the $ 1.4bn ( £ 0.9bn ) funding for the proposed 2016 and 2018 mission			2
@entity1 is still working on another possible @entity2 mission to replace the cancelled missions , with a decision due this month			1
the mission will study the interior of @entity2 in a bid to find out how it formed			0
here , the red planet 's geography is revealed with a topographical map			2
but @entity96 , a prominent scientist who studies @entity15 and its moons , criticised the decision , saying there was ' too much emphasis on @entity2 in our current plans for planetary exploration '			0
she said : ' most of the solar system resides beyond the orbits of the asteroids			0
' there is more to learn there about general planetary processes than on @entity2 … why more @entity2 ? ' @entity2 beat missions to explore @entity15 's @entity111 and its odd methane oceans , and a mission to land on a comet as it nears the sun. opponents of further @entity2 missions say @entity1 has not approved missions to the other outer planets or a comet since a @entity122 mission was picked in 2001			2

@entity1 's next @entity2 rover will be able to drill 16 feet under the @entity2 surface .			1

robot will drill 16 feet under the @entity2 surface to measure temperatures
could find new evidence of *massive* *marsquakes* on the red planet
some scientists hit back at decision , *claiming* @entity1 is too focused on @entity2
