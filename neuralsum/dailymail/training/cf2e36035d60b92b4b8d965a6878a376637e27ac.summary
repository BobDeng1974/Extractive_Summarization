by @entity0 and @entity1 preacher : the guide was written by @entity4 who was killed by @entity6 airstrikes in @entity7 a bizarre ' must - read ' @entity10 language manual for @entity11 wanting to become a terrorist has been published by @entity13 , it emerged today			1
the glossy 16 - page guide includes rules that recruits must follow as well as recommendations on how to cope with the hardships and dangers of life as a jihad			1
it includes everyday advice on taking showers , camping and how to avoid difficult questions - but also suggests new recruits target the @entity6			1
the guide was written by @entity4 , an @entity6 who served as the top propagandist for the @entity7 - based branch of @entity13 , who was killed by @entity6 hellfire missiles during a drone attack			1
he died in september 2011 , along with the @entity6 - born radical cleric @entity33			1
it starts by saying : ' for those @entity36 coming from the @entity37 , this is a must read document as it includes an invaluable information which will enable them to appropriately understand the importance of their role in the scale of this battle and provide them with a visibility to aptly choose their next step			1
' the first section of the guide is titled ' cleanliness ' and states : ' in some cases , you will be staying with a few brothers in a tight room or house			1
' in order to avoid unnecessary problems , encourage yourself and your brothers to clean the room ( s ) on a regular basis			2
as for yourself , a daily shower is ideal but not possible in many cases			0
' @entity4 then goes on to offer advice on how to cope with the life of a jihad			2
he says : ' if you feel terrified close your eyes and imagine yourself inside paradise			0
think of your hoor [ virgins ] that are awaiting you as well as meeting the prophets			0
' another section urges @entity11 recruits to stay on their home ' sand , rocks or grass ' and attack ' @entity6 in its own backyard '			1
the guide continues : ' the effect is much greater , it always embarrasses the enemy , and these types of individual decision - making attacks are nearly impossible for them to contain			2
' bizarre : the front page of the jihad manual expectations full written by @entity4 the guide includes a section on bringing your family to jihad training with terrorists @entity4 states : ' in al - qa’idah , we do n’t care about the size of your muscles , how fast you run , how strong your legs are and so on - although these things will be strengthened - but we put a special focus on " lasting long " and outdoing the enemy in patience			1
' in short , prepare for the worse , and hope in the best			0
' the manual , which also praises cleanliness , says secrecy is one of the pillars of modern day jihad , advising recruits not to reveal their place of birth to other jihadists and to refrain from asking them too many questions			1
the guide also urges ' brothers ' to attack @entity6			1
pictured here is the @entity122 in @entity123 on involving family members in acts of terrorism , it says : ' if you have a family that you want to bring to jihad , it may or may not be possible depending on the logistics of the mujahideen			2
' in @entity7 for example , it 's extremely difficult to bring your wife and kids to live amongst the mujahideen			1
in other lands , this may not be a problem			0
' so if you know that the land you are going to is tight on this , then what you can do is bring your family to the land , but keep them in a city where they will be safe and protected by friends			2
@entity4 was a top figure in @entity13 in @entity7 , where soldiers pictured above are still regularly fighting @entity13 - linked militants in the southern province of @entity154 @entity13 leader @entity155 , pictured in @entity156 ' you do n't want to risk them being captured by the murtadeen and witnessing them getting raped and tortured in order to extract information about you			2
' the manual also gives a quick guide to camping : ' living outdoors will be the most difficult of bases to stay in			2
in some bases , it wo n't be too bad since the mujahideen will erect tents and there might be some basic comforts			0
' it is possible though that there will be incidents were none of this will be available and you will have to sleep on sand , rocks or grass			0
they may or may not have blankets and sleeping bags available			0
' as for the weather , you should do some research into the country before arriving as to what it ’s like during the day and night , especially in deserts , mountainous regions and forests			0
' you will want to wear your boots / sneakers / sandals most of the time in the outdoors , but you should get used to taking it off everyday or at least every 3 days to avoid running into foot problems			0
' a brother in @entity156 sticked to taking his boots off every 3 days but did n’t do a good job of washing his feet thoroughly ; after some time , he developed a strange foot disease where his small toe was pushed underneath his foot			0
' after that , he could no longer walk			0
take good care of your feet and wash them properly			0
