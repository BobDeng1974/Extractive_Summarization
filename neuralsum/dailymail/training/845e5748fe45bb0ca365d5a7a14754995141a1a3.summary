by @entity0 @entity1 has continued his public skewering of the @entity4 - controlled @entity3 following the government shutdown			1
after a lengthy attack on monday about the decision to avoid passing the budget due to the @entity4 hatred for the @entity10 , he had a different target during his first show since the shutdown went into effect			0
during his tuesday show , @entity1 lambasted @entity4 talking heads who he believed were belittling @entity18 who will be affected by the suspension of certain government programs			2
' if you believe the @entity32 , it 's time to go out and buy the potted meat and @entity40 and get in your survival bunker , ' the conservative guest said during the @entity30 clip			1
' f * * * you because first of all , democrats are n't the ones with survival bunkers - that 's you guys , ' @entity1 said , as seen in the clip available on @entity50			1
' and second , i know that for you potted meat and @entity40 is shorthand for sh * * you would n't possibly consider eating unless there was a catastrophe but for the people actuall affected by the government shutdown , it 's the sh * * they eat that they can no longer afford			0
' pointed : he used a clip of a @entity4 commentator on @entity31 's @entity30 show as an example of the belittling attitude that @entity4 have for the @entity18 who have lost assistance during the shutdown the program in question is the @entity70 ( @entity70 ) supplemental nutrition program for low - income citizens			1
' it 's like taking candy from a baby , except instead of candy , it 's food , ' @entity1 said			1
the comedian - turned - political satirist made his feelings about the logjam abundantly clear on monday night when his show aired just an hour before the shutdown went into effect			2
while a number of news anchors likened the back - and - forth of the bills between the @entity87 and the @entity3 as a stalemate , as opposed to the one - sided conflict that @entity1 sees			2
' i 'm all for a pox on both their houses when appropriate but this is not a game of chicken ! this is when someone is driving to work and there 's a car coming directly at them in their lane			0
that 's not a game of chicken , that 's an a * * * * * * causing a head - on collision , ' he said			0
political posturing : @entity1 said that @entity4 were only making themselves look worse by discrediting president @entity112 's talks with the @entity114 president ' did you see the @entity117 game on sunday ? okay : they lost 31 to 7			1
and you know what the @entity117 did n’t say after that game ? ' if you do n’t give us 25 more points by midnight on monday , we are gon na shut down the @entity125 ! ' ' would n't it be nice if the @entity127 aspired to the maturity and problem solving capacity of football players - this is utter insanity he also critiqued the @entity4 talking point that many of the party 's leaders have been touting , saying that president @entity112 is to blame for the shutdown because he did not spend enough time with congressional leaders talking over possible compromises			2
instead , they raised his landmark discussion with the president of @entity114 as a offensive tactic , one which @entity1 said only made @entity4 look worse			0
' you ’re not helping yourself			0
if it turns out that president @entity112 can make a deal with the most intransigent , hardline , unreasonable , totalitarian mullahs in the world , but not with @entity4 , maybe he ’s not the problem , ' he said .			0

comedian took aim at a clip where a conservative commentator said that @entity32 were making the shutdown seem like the apocalypse
@entity1 said that the cuts to nutrition assistance programs were *devastating* to low - income families
