by @entity0 follow @ @ charliesale @entity1 , beleaguered @entity2 chief executive , will be called to account by the @entity3 to deliver his promises of engaging on equality issues			1
@entity3 independent director @entity6 has been charged with the @entity3 of ensuring that @entity1 , following the sexist email exchange scandal , keeps his ' undertaking to take further steps on inclusion and diversity			1
' this followed a meeting between @entity3 chairman @entity14 , @entity6 , chairman of the @entity3 inclusion board and @entity17 , interim @entity2 chairman who explained the process behind the @entity2 clubs voting unanimously not to take action against ceo following his puerile exchanges with tv rights lawyer @entity24			1
watch : @entity1 will be called to account by the @entity3 to deliver his promises judgement : @entity3 board member @entity6 has called for major action in light of the sexism row ' entering into email exchanges of this nature was wrong and the apology i have made is sincere , as is the contrition i feel			1
these exchanges do not reflect my views towards women in football , the workplace or in general			2
it is something that will never be repeated			2
' the premier league shareholders have considered and deliberated this matter and i fully accept and respect their recommendations and conclusions			2
' i appreciate that i have a tremendous amount of hard work to do to convince those in the game who do not know me that my leadership and work in the areas of equality and discrimination to date reflect who i am and what i believe			2
so , i will now undertake meetings and discussions with a wide range of stakeholders in the game to hear their views and to reassure them that i will continue to do my utmost personally , and through all the @entity2 ’s means to help promote diversity and inclusion , develop the women ’s game and support women who want be involved in football at any level			2
' i am grateful for the support i have received throughout this from family , friends and colleagues , but especially the women who work with me at the @entity2			2
' @entity14 said @entity76 had assured him the @entity2 had followed : ' proper process under their own employment and disciplinary rules and had conducted a thorough investigation			0
' @entity14 added : ' we said last week that we considered the contents of the emails in question to be totally inappropriate and we are still of that view			0
i have asked @entity6 to follow up with the @entity2 to discuss the wider issues around the inclusion agenda and see how the @entity3 and @entity2 can work together			1
' the @entity3 restated its position that it can not take disciplinary action itself against @entity1 , despite claims from @entity91 , the outspoken member of the @entity3 inclusion board that he has legal advice to the contrary			1
but the inclusion board meeting was a non-event last night with a brief statement from @entity6 afterwards ' welcoming @entity1 's contrite apology			1
' @entity14 said : ' the @entity3 does not as a matter of policy consider private communications sent with a legitimate expectation of privacy to amount to professional misconduct			1
the @entity3 has applied this policy on an ongoing basis and in relation to numerous other cases			1
' @entity24 has also escaped reprimand after an investigation by his law firm @entity111 was concluded last night			0
a statement said : ' we have accepted mr @entity24 ’s assurances that these emails are not reflective of his believes and values and there will be no recurrence of this behaviour			0
' inappropriate : but @entity3 chairman insists they followed the ' proper process ' in investigating @entity1 's actions but women in @entity125 kept the heat on @entity1 calling for an independent inquiry			1
their statement read : women in football is disappointed that the @entity2 has missed a significant opportunity to demonstrate a strong commitment to equality in the workplace			0
' in not recommending action - in any form whatsoever – it will be extremely difficult for women working in the industry to feel reassured this issue has been adequately addressed			0
' we believe it is imperative that any conclusion reached by the @entity2 are done so through an objective audit in which employees are given the opportunity to express their views anonymously to an independent body			1
' and @entity146 , @entity1 ’s former temporary personal assistant who leaked his text exchanges with @entity24 to the @entity148 , is considering taking legal action against the @entity2			1

@entity156 said : ' it was a very threatening letter			0
i have had a couple now and i believe the premier league are trying to scare me			0
i wo n’t go quiet because i am standing up for what i believe in			0
i am speaking to a solicitor at the moment			0
' strong : @entity146 is considering taking legal action against the @entity2			0
