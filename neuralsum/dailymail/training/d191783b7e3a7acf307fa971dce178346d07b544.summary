finding yourself in dangerous situations is something of an occupational hazard for nature and wildlife documentary presenters			0
but vet turned television host @entity7 had a closer call than many when he took a speed boat ride around glaciers with @entity14 expert @entity13			1
while filming the @entity17 documentary @entity16 , the pair got a little bit too close to a glacier as huge chunks of ice crack and fall off the giant frozen mound and crash into the water			1
as @entity7 and @entity13 sat in the cove trying to get the engine running again , small pieces of ice began dropping into the water creating small waves that made the boat start to rock			1
as the smaller sections of ice collapse , @entity7 watches in awe and exclaims : ' i do n't want that in the boat			2
' they manage to get the boat going again and move out of the glacier 's cove around the face of the ice which stands at around 40 or 50 metres high			0
racing away : @entity7 looks back as @entity13 puts the boat into full throttle and speeds away from the glacier collapse : a huge section of the ice tumbled off the giant frozen mound and into the ocean just as the pair have passed a second sheet of ice tumbles from the glacier into the icy sea			1
@entity7 points out that an enormous block right at the top of the glacier looks almost certain to fall at any time and he and @entity13 move the boat slightly further away to safety			1
he tells @entity13 : ' that whole front is going to go at some point			2
' suddenly , a giant chunk of ice splits from the glacier 's top making a thundering cracking sound and turning the water beneath it choppy			0
treacherous : the pair had sailed dangerously close to the glacier which shows huge cracks @entity13 is startled into life and puts the boat to full throttle to get as far away from the falling ice as possible			2
as the boat speeds off chunks of flying debris fly towards @entity7 and @entity13 narrowly missing them as they gleefully shout			1
thankfully , both men and their boat make it to safety without getting hurt			0
and it seems that @entity7 might think twice before getting up so close to a glacier again			0
he tells the camera : ' that was a bit too close for comfort '			0
awestruck : @entity7 pictured looking up at the glacier , later described it as a ' death trap '			0

@entity7 and @entity13 were filming @entity16
@entity17 documentary almost took a *dramatic* turn when they were almost *crushed*
