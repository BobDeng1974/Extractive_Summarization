it 's the stuff of nightmares : a dig at a macabre graveyard has revealed a @entity5 vampire pinned to his resting place by a metal spike			1
the ancient skeleton , identified as a 35 to 40 year old male , is only the second ever skeleton with a spike driven near its heart in this way , after one that was found last year in the southern town of @entity16			1
it is thought the man , considered to be a vampire by his medieval contemporaries , was pinned to his grave using the ploughshare - the metal end of a plough - to prevent him from leaving at midnight and terrorising the living			2
the ancient skeleton , identified as a 35 - 40 year old male , was discovered with a large metal ploughshare ( pictured in rusty orange , top right ) driven through his left shoulder the discovery was made at the @entity34 site , in the east of the country , during a dig led by the ‘ @entity5 @entity39 ’ professor @entity38			1
last year , a group heading by professor @entity38 unearthed another 700 - year - old skeleton of a man pinned down in his earth in a church in the @entity46 town of @entity16			1
the skeleton , which quickly became known as the ‘ @entity16 vampire , ’ was pierced through the chest with a ploughshare and has his teeth pulled out before being put to rest			1
professor @entity38 has said described the latest finding as the ‘ twin of the @entity16 vampire ’ and said it could shed light on how vampire beliefs in the @entity60 were preserved by @entity61 in the middle ages			1
the man , thought at the time to be a vampire , was pinned to his grave using the plough to prevent him from leaving at midnight and terrorising the living the discovery was made at @entity34 in a dig led by the ' @entity5 @entity39 ' professor @entity38 coins found with the body have been dated it to the 13th and 14th century			1
in other cases professor @entity38 said he had found skeletons ‘ nailed to the ground with iron staples driven into the limbs ’ but this was only the second case were a ploughshare was used near the heart			1
‘ [ the ploughshare ] weighs almost 2 pounds ( 0.9kg ) and is dug into the body into a broken shoulder bone , ’ he said			1
‘ you can clearly see how the collarbone has literally popped out			2
’ this is the latest in a succession of finds across western and central @entity91 that shed new light on how seriously people took the threat of vampires			2
last year , a group heading by professor @entity38 unearthed another 700 - year - old skeleton of a man pinned down in his earth in a church in the @entity46 town of @entity16 professor @entity38 has said described the latest finding , discovered at @entity34 ( pictured ) as the ' twin of the @entity16 vampire ' and said it could shed light on how vampire beliefs in the @entity60 were preserved by @entity61 in the middle ages according to @entity110 belief , people who were considered bad during their lifetimes might turn into vampires after death unless stabbed in the chest with an iron or wooden rod before being buried			1
these ' vampires ' were often , intellectuals , aristocrats and clerics			0
a skeleton found last year , which quickly became known as the ' @entity16 vampire , ' was also pierced through the chest with a ploughshare ' the curious thing is that there are no women among them			1
they were not afraid of witches , ’ said @entity5 's national history museum chief , @entity129			1
the string of plagues which ravaged @entity91 between 1300 and 1700 helped cement an already growing belief in vampires			0
gravediggers reopening mass graves following a plague would sometimes come across bodies bloated by gas , with hair still growing , and blood seeping from their @entity142 shrouds used to cover the faces of the dead were often decayed by bacteria in the mouth , revealing the corpse 's teeth , and vampires became known as ' shroud - eaters			2
' according to medieval medical and religious texts , the ' undead ' were believed to spread pestilence in order to suck the remaining life from corpses until they acquired the strength to return to the streets again			0
‘ in my opinion it 's not about criminals or bad people , ’ said professor @entity38			1
‘ rather , these are precautionary measures that prevent the soul from being taken by the forces of evil in the 40 day period after death			2
’ over 100 buried people whose corpses were stabbed to prevent them from becoming vampires have been discovered across @entity5 over the years			1
the belief in vampires was widespread throughout @entity5 and other parts of central @entity91 throughout the @entity178			2
the word vampire is derived from the original slavic term opyrb or opir which later appears as vipir , vepir , or vapir			0
drunkards , thieves and murderers were all believed to be likely candidates to become vampires			0
@entity188 prepares to drive a wooden stake through the heart of vampire			0
the scene was in ' @entity193 ' appearing completely normal , they would arrive at a town and live amongst the people often even marrying and fathering children			0
but at night they would wander the countryside in search of blood			0
these types of vampires could be destroyed with a stake through the heart			0
one account maintains that a vampire was the soul of an outlaw who died in the mountains or forest or along a country road , and whose corpse is eaten by crows , wolves , or some other such scavengers			0
because such a soul is not permitted to enter heaven or hell it remains on earth haunting the place where he was killed strangling and drinking the blood of anyone who comes by			0
another account states a person who died a violent , unnatural death or whose corpse was jumped over by a cat before burial , can become a vampire			0
in such cases during the first 40 days after burial , the bones turn to gelatin and the vampire performs mischief at night - releasing animals from their pens , scattering house hold items , and suffocating people			2
during the first forty days it can be destroyed by a @entity244 - a professional vampire hunter capable of seeing them - or alternatively devoured by a wolf			0
however if not destroyed in this time period the @entity247 would develop a skeleton and becomes even more fierce .			0

the skeleton is of 35 - 40 year old male from the 13th or 14th century
discovery is similar to one found by the same team in @entity16 last year
it was uncovered by the ‘ @entity5 @entity39 ’ @entity38
