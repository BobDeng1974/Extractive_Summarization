by @entity0 birthday boy @entity1 hit back from a set down to turn his quarter - final against @entity4 around completely and keep his hopes for a record ninth @entity7 title alive			1
on the day after he turned 28 , @entity1 was slow to come out of the blocks and deservedly lost his first set at @entity10 this year as @entity4 nudged in front			0
almost every facet of @entity1 's game was below par at that point , but he awoke from his slumber and struck back in blistering fashion to win 4 - 6 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 0 , 6 - 1			1
on the march : @entity1 continued his incredible form at the @entity7 @entity20 does it : @entity1 sealed his spot in the semi-finals of the @entity7 after blitzing his compatriot powerhouse display : after losing the first set , @entity1 was relentless in his pursuit of victory in the early stages @entity4 's impressive shot variation caused problems for @entity1 , but he used the anger from losing the opening set to fuel a complete turnaround			2
@entity1 will face @entity35 in the semi-finals after the @entity39 champion 's win over home favourite @entity40			1
the world number one made 12 unforced errors in the first seven games , to @entity4 's five , and that made it all too easy for his compatriot to gain a foothold in the contest			0
@entity4 , who hit 13 winners in the opening set and had plenty of joy from forays to the net , broke @entity1 early on before the @entity55 responded immediately			2
at that point many would have expected @entity1 to kick on , but he continued to struggle before @entity4 made him pay by claiming the first of two break points to clinch the set			0
last time the two met @entity4 beat @entity1 in straight sets at the quarter - final stage of the @entity63 world tour masters 1000 @entity64 , so it was not too much of a surprise that he was proving such a tricky customer			0
working up a sweat : @entity4 won the first set but was steamrollered by the defending champion in a repeat of last year 's final hard work : @entity4 was given a ruthless examination by a relentless @entity1 but in the second set @entity1 came out with renewed purpose and never looked back			1
his frustrations were epitomised by a furious smash close to the net to set up a break point in the third game , which he duly converted with a pin - point backhand down the line			0
@entity1 's trademark pace and power began to give @entity4 the run - around but he still had opportunities and let a break point slip at 3 - 2			0
@entity1 was ruthless in clinching the second set , serving the final game out to love to tie the @entity91 mean streak carried over into the third set as @entity4 began to buckle under the sheer ferocity of @entity1 , who raced into a 5 - 0 lead to serve for the set			1
with the world number one now finding top form he made no mistakes , with no unforced errors throughout the third set , once more holding serve to love to take the lead			0
@entity4 had started to look like a broken man at that point , going 3 - 0 down in the fourth set , before crafting two break points to give himself a glimmer of hope			1
after letting one slip he made no mistake to end an 11 - game losing streak , but @entity1 broke back immediately and then won the next two games to win the match at a canter .			2

in a repeat of last year 's final , @entity4 won the first set 6 - 4 and an epic encounter *beckoned*
but @entity1 stormed back , *dropping* just five more games in the match , winning the second set 6 - 4 , the third 6 - 0 and the fourth 6 - 1
after seeing off his *fellow* @entity55 , @entity1 will face @entity35 in the semi-finals on *friday*
