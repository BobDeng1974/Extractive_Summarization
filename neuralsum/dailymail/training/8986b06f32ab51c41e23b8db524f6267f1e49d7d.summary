by @entity0 one @entity2 's most famous police units has had its numbers slashed because felons are giving up on old - fashioned bank robberies			1
the @entity7 's @entity6 , which deals with bank heists and armed robberies , has had half of its bases closed and shed almost 50 officers as criminals turn to online theft instead			1
flying squad , nicknamed the @entity16 , was once faced with an onslaught of major robberies , which peaked in 1992 with 291 raids in @entity20 alone			2
obsolete ? the @entity7 's @entity6 , as portrayed above in 1970s drama @entity22 , has had its numbers slashed by almost a third in just one year not like the old days : the cuts come as criminals shun traditional bank robberies , once staple fare of @entity6 officers , such as those shown by @entity30 @entity29 above that year there were 847 raids nationwide , a figure which has plummeted since			1
the latest data from the @entity35 , for 2012 , show 108 branch robberies , 26 of which were in @entity20			2
and the decline looks set to continue , with @entity6 officers investigating 33 bank robberies in the 2013/14 financial year , just five per cent of their total workload			1
as a result , officer numbers have been cut from 112 to 160 , two of their four bases closed , and the whole unit folded in to a large organised and economic crime command			2
the squad was made famous in the 1970s by @entity50 series @entity22 , starring @entity30 as detective inspector @entity22 , and @entity29 as detective sergeant @entity51			1
real - life @entity6 officers helped investigate some of @entity2 's most notorious criminals , including the @entity55 and the gang behind the @entity57			2
heist no more : the number of bank robberies reported each year has fallen from a high of 847 nationwide in 1992 to barely more than 100 in 2012 perhaps their finest hour came in 2000 , when a diamond raid on the @entity64 was dramatically foiled by 140 officers			1
a gang of robbers smashed a @entity69 digger into the dome , intending to make off with the fabulous £ 200million @entity71 , along with 11 other fine diamonds			0
they were armed with smoke bombs , ammonia knock - out gas and nailguns to break through high - security glass			0
their plan was then to flee the dome via speedboat and , police believe , sell on their takings to mafia bosses			0
but @entity6 had been tipped off , replaced the gems with fakes and lay in wait for the raid on november 7			0
all the robbers and accomplices were captured , while cctv cameras captured every moment			0
finest hour ? @entity6 officers foiled a dramatic diamond raid on the @entity64 in 2000 smashed : thieves busted through security glass defending the £ 200million @entity71 diamond - but officers had replaced it with a fake and swiftly arrested all the would - be robbers @entity103 foiled : @entity6 officers can be seen above approaching a speed boat which would have been the getaway vehicle now , however , criminals are turning to less dramatic , but equally costly , raids carried out through cyberspace			1
earlier this year gang leader @entity108 was jailed after admitting a raid at a @entity111 bank in northwest @entity20			0
but rather than guns and getaway cars , the robbery was carried out using a keyboard video mouse - a device which he used to hijack the bank 's computers and siphon off £ 1.3million			0
it comes as anti-fraud agencies report a resurgence of thefts using bank card data - with £ 450million stolen from @entity2 cards through a combination of identity theft , cloned cards , computer viruses and internet scams in 2013			1
the figure had shot up 16 per cent since 2012 , approaching its all - time peak from 2006			0
online banking fraud has also increased to £ 40.9 million , up from £ 39.6 million in 2012			2
bank card fraud is on the increase , with losses on @entity2 cards totalling £ 450.4 million last year , a 16 per cent rise on 2012			1
online banking fraud increased by 3 per cent to £ 40.9 million , up from £ 39.6 million in 2012			0
a @entity140 spokesman said : ' the last 12 months have seen the @entity7 undergo significant changes as we seek to modernise the services we provide the public whilst making essential savings			0

@entity7 cuts almost 50 @entity6 officers in a single year
armed crime unit now has 112 officers and has lost two of its bases
the unit was made famous by the 1970s police drama @entity22
bank robberies have fallen from 847 a year in 1992 to just 108 in 2012
now criminals *prefer* *sophisticated* raids on using computer *technology*
card fraud is also on the rise , with £ 450million stolen from *victims* in 2013
