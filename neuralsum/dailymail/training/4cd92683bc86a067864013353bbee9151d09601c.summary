by @entity0 published : 16:15 est , 23 june 2012 updated : 01:00 est , 24 june 2012 the chance encounter online between a gorgeous young 18 - year - old girl named @entity3 and a handsome 18 - year - old marine called @entity5 seemed on the surface to be innocent enough			1
however , what @entity3 , whose online name was @entity8 , did n't know was that her ' sweet sexy @entity10 ' was actually a 46 - year - old married father of two from @entity13 , in @entity14			1
and what @entity5 did n't know until it was too late was that the beautiful girl who sent him underwear and promised marriage was in fact a 45 - year - old woman called @entity21 who lived in @entity22 , @entity23			1
intrigued by the flirtatious nature of the messages and the beautiful profile pic the girl called ' @entity3 ' had , @entity5 decided to use the anonymity of the @entity39 and message her back pretending to be 18 too			1
before long the messaging became romantic , but it ultimately led to the unraveling of @entity5 's marriage , the death of a co-worker , his own eventual imprisonment and the shocking twist which haunts him to this day			2
giving himself the moniker ' @entity49 ' , @entity5 told ' @entity3 ' that he was a young , handsome @entity51 - bound @entity10 , while she claimed to be a softball - playing high school senior from @entity54			1
a blurred picture of @entity56 , the 18 - year - old daughter of @entity21 , who used it under the online name @entity8 as the pair 's online affair intensified , ' @entity3 ' began to send @entity5 extremely provocative photographs and he sent her a picture of himself from 30 years ago , when he was a member of the @entity10			1
' i kept thinking , well , we 're never going to meet ... i 'll just play the game with her , ' said @entity5 , whose tragic story has now been turned into a @entity68 directed by ' friends ' @entity69			0
the cyber-flirting , which began in may 2005 , soon turned to cyber-sex as @entity5 lied about his history of covert ops , even though he never saw action during his stint in the military			2
described by neighbours as a good man who worked for his daughters ' swim team board , @entity5 's life slowly started to become fixated around his conversations online with ' @entity3			1
' she fed him photos from ' her ' high school basketball team , softball team , graduation and prom as their relationship continued for months			0
on his part , @entity5 had created an alter - ego of himself as younger and stronger			0
' he was my height , six - feet tall , had bright red hair , ' said @entity5 to @entity98			0
' big shoulders , muscles and all that			0
' online messages recovered between the lying pair revealed that the relationship had become dangerously obsessive for @entity5 who said it ' became more real to me than real life '			0
@entity5 sent ' @entity3 ' this picture of himself as ' @entity49 '			2
it was in fact picture of himself taken thirty years beforehand the exchange of gifts between the pair continued as did love letters			0
' i love you always and forever , @entity118 , ' wrote ' @entity3 '			0
' i have never felt this way , ' @entity5 replied			0
wanting to end the affair , @entity5 found he could n't and described it as like a ' drug '			0
it transpired that @entity21 was taking pictures of her daughter @entity3 and passing them off as pictures of herself to @entity127 and other men online it even seemed that he was losing touch with reality , as a note to himself proved			1
' on january 2 , 2006 @entity133 ( 46 - years - old ) ceases to exist and is replaced by an 18 - year - old battle - scarred marine ... he is moving to @entity23 to be with the love of his life			1
' however , fate caught up with him as his wife @entity138 found a package that ' @entity3 ' had sent to @entity127 which led her to his secret pile of photos , underwear and letters from @entity23			2
@entity138 took matters into her own hands and sent a letter back to the sender with a photo of her husband and his family			0
the picture that @entity152 ( right ) sent ' @entity3 ' of her family life with @entity5 ' let me introduce you to these people , ' she wrote			0
' the man in the centre is @entity133 , my husband since 1989 ... he is 46 years old			0
' horrified , ' @entity3 ' sent @entity5 a text message ending the affair			2
' she sends me a text message and says , she hates me ... you should be put in jail for this , ' said @entity5 to @entity98			0
a vengeful ' @entity3 ' / @entity21 then used the @entity39 to find a 22 - year - old co-worker of @entity127 called @entity166 , setting in motion a tragic series of events which led to his murder			1
@entity166 was a 22 - year - old co-worker of @entity5 and became the object of ' @entity3 ' / @entity21 's affections after she rejected @entity127 she flirted online with @entity166 , who called himself ' beefcake ' , on open forums for @entity5 to see			1
with both men believing that she was the gorgeous young thing in her profile pictures and keepsakes sent to them , the pair engaged in a furious rivalry			0
a blurred picture of @entity182 which her mother @entity183 sent to @entity5 when she was flirting online with him ' @entity166 will pay in blood , ' wrote @entity5 at one point to ' @entity3 '			2
as the messages he sent to ' @entity3 ' became increasingly unhinged , @entity5 was embarrassed online by @entity166 and @entity21 as they posted his real age and picture onto forums , making him out to be a pedophile			1
eventually , @entity166 decided to visit ' @entity3 ' even though @entity21 had warned him not to			2
@entity5 found out about this , became incensed and on september 15 , 2006 , drove to meet @entity166 as he left where they both worked and shot him three times , killing him			2
as police responded to the murder , they quickly uncovered the internet love - triangle and when they could n't find @entity5 , rushed to ' @entity3 '			2
however , when police arrived at her door they were presented with 45 - year - old @entity21			1
telling her what had happened and how they desperately needed to speak to @entity3 , @entity21 broke down in a wail of tears and confessed her whole elaborate deception of @entity127 and @entity166			1
upon questioning her , they discovered that @entity3 was in fact her daughter and the pictures and underwear she had been sending belonged to her 18 - year - old			1
it was later discovered that @entity21 had flirted online , as ' @entity3 ' , with other men too , and once pointed a videocamera up her unaware daughter 's skirt for a video she sent to several men with the question , ' guys , do you like it ? ' now 52 , @entity5 is serving 20 - years in @entity223 in @entity14 for the murder of @entity166 @entity3 had no knowledge of her mother 's cyber-life			1
when the police apprehended @entity5 for the murder of @entity166 they built up a strong case against him having found his dna at the crime scene and a family photo which showed the gun used to shoot the 22 - year - old			1
@entity5 pleaded guilty to @entity166 's murder and was sentenced to 20 - years			1
prosecutors in @entity14 desperately searched for a reason to charge @entity21 , but ultimately , could find no law she had broken			0
in her defence she claimed that she was keeping @entity127 online so that he could n't talk to other teenagers			0
@entity21 has never apologised to her daughter and her husband divorced her and @entity3 cut off contact			2
@entity166 's parents began a petition to for laws to protect against future @entity247			0
but there seems to be no suggestion as to what such laws would look like from lawmakers in @entity14			0

@entity5 began an *unplanned* online affair with a girl he believed was 18 - years - old called ' @entity3 '
@entity5 told ' @entity3 ' he was an 18 - year - old @entity10
when @entity5 's wife discovered the affair she sent ' @entity261 ' a photo of her 46 - year - old husband and their two *children*
' @entity3 ' broke off the affair and began a new one with @entity127 's 22 - year - old co-worker @entity166
@entity5 became so *jealous* he shot and killed @entity166
it turned out ' @entity3 ' was in fact a 45 - year - old woman called @entity21 who used her own daughter 's pictures to send to men online
