@entity0 have wrapped @entity1 in cotton wool by ruling him out of their one - day tour of @entity5 to safeguard his fitness for the @entity8			1
@entity0 ’s prize bowling asset was troubled by his left knee during the summer and was still feeling it when he joined up with the rest of the 50 - over squad on tuesday at the start of their three - day training camp in @entity16			0
now he will miss the seven - match one - day series in @entity5 , which starts on november 26 , along with his strike partner @entity18 , who is still recovering from an operation on his right knee			0
@entity1 has been ruled out of @entity0 's odi tour to @entity5 with a knee injury @entity23 - november 26 , @entity24 ( 9am bst ) second odi - november 29 , @entity24 ( 4.30am ) @entity26 - december 3 , @entity27 ( 9am ) @entity28 - december 6 , @entity24 ( 4.30am ) fifth odi - december 10 , @entity29 ( 9am ) sixth odi - december 13 , @entity29 ( 4.30am ) @entity30 - december 16 , @entity24 ( 9am ) @entity0 remain confident that both will be fit and ready for the @entity8 in @entity32 and @entity33 in february but there will remain a question mark over both crucial figures until they are ready to bowl again			1
@entity1 has now been told to rest but hopes to continue his recovery in @entity40 before @entity41 with the @entity42 and if all goes well he will return for the triangular series that precedes the @entity8			2
@entity0 do not plan to call up a replacement to face @entity5 , meaning more opportunities for the likes of @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and all - rounder @entity50			0
however , not having a bowler who has taken 257 wickets in 184 one - day internationals is a blow to @entity0 ’s hopes of upsetting @entity5 in their own conditions in a crucial segment of their @entity8 preparations			0
