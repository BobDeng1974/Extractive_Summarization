the feeling is familiar and not entirely comfortable			0
i 'm outside @entity2 , digging through my purse , pockets and handbag for some spare coins or - oh , please ! - a stray £ 5 note			2
i want a latte , but i do n't think i can afford one			1
i remember this feeling of counting the pennies - literally - only too well			2
but i thought i 'd left it behind in my university days , when i 'd had to eke out my allowance to see me through term			0
i did n't imagine i 'd still be making these calculations over such trivial transactions aged 43			1
it turns out i have the misfortune to be part of the first generation that can expect to be worse off than their parents			0
struggling to stay afloat : @entity25 in the kitchen of her £ 1m home - but she says she 's not a wealthy woman there 's even a name for us : we 're the ' dumpies ' , the downwardly mobile , urban middle - aged people			1
but curiously , i find myself in another category entirely : a dumpy who is hiding behind a facade of opulence			2
for , as i shuffle home , without my latte , i turn the key in the door of a five - bedroom house worth £ 1 million			1
to anyone looking on , i am a wealthy woman			2
but the hole in my bank balance tells another story			0
yes , i live in a lovely house in a nice area of @entity51 , but unless i sell up there will be no money in my threadbare pocket			1
with the mortgage market tightened up as it is , it would be virtually impossible for our family to move anyway , as we would never get a loan to buy a new house			2
since last april - the month we completed on our house - lending is based strictly on what you earn and your outgoings , not the size of your deposit or the equity in your home			1
as such , it would be impossible for us to get a mortgage with our finances as they stand			0
while our mortgage repayment is fixed at £ 2,000 , factor in bills , food , loans and the general upkeep of four growing boys and it adds up to more than £ 4,000			1
my husband , @entity80 , runs his own business , so his income can fluctuate hugely , while my earnings as a freelance writer are unpredictable			2
add to this the fact our savings were wiped out by buying and renovating our house and we can never be sure we will earn enough to support our family from one month to the next			2
from the outside we might look like a prosperous , middle - class family , but underneath we are paddling madly to keep the whole thing afloat			1
i know i wo n't get much sympathy , but we did n't buy this house for its status			1
we simply wanted a home where our four boys - @entity97 , 11 , @entity98 , nine , and five - year - old twins @entity100 and @entity101 , - could each have their own room , like we did			2
we 've spent six months renovating it from a wreck that had lain untouched for 40 years			0
@entity25 and her husband @entity80 need a big home so their four sons can all have a room of their own much - needed family home : the couple drained their savings to buy and renovate the house in @entity51 during this time , i was unable to work much due to ill health , and my husband 's sports equipment business suffered as we focused on the demanding - and costly - build project			1
unforeseen costs - such as the extension that turned out to have no foundations and had to be rebuilt for £ 20,000 - drained our savings and forced us to borrow way more than we 'd planned			2
but i am not alone			0
while most of my contemporaries enjoyed all the perks of a middle - class upbringing in the @entity127 - living in a spacious family house , private schooling and at least one foreign holiday a year - few of us can offer our children such luxuries			1
both my husband and i were privately educated , but with four sons , we always knew we could n't do the same for them			1
just the basics are hard enough to cover			0
each month we are juggling funds to cover school dinners , never mind the music and riding lessons that were part of our childhoods			2
our eldest son recently sat entrance exams for a place at our local grammar school			0
as we celebrated his success in passing , i am not sure we were n't even happier we could finally stop shelling out £ 45 a week for his tutor			0
my wardrobe comes from supermarkets and discount stores			0
lavish : but @entity25 said the money spent on their family home means they ca n't afford many other luxuries like holidays or a private education for their children but it 's not just me , as more often than not when i compliment a girlfriend on her new top or pair of boots she will reply : ' it was a steal at @entity168			1
' as a child it was a simple pleasure to shop for groceries with my mum			0
my parents had a successful furniture import - export business , and we 'd go to @entity175 to pick out fillet steak , fine wines and perhaps an elegant fruit tart for pudding			0
for me , @entity175 is strictly for the odd luxury			0
our weekly shop is done scouring the shelves of @entity183 for bargains			0
i know my mother never checked the price of a thing during her supermarket outings ; i have to stick to a strict budget of £ 100 for our family of six			0
while i love my house , i will sometimes lie awake at night worrying whether we will be able to keep up the payments on the mortgage , which is almost half the value of our home			0
it just does n't seem fair that hard working people should be condemned to penny - pinching thanks a toxic storm of sky - rocketing house prices , rising living costs and stagnating wages			1
our parents never faced such financial challenges - in fact , for them providing a comfortable lifestyle seemed easy in comparison			0
do i resent that ? you bet i do ! different upbringing : @entity25 and her husband ( pictured skiing and at @entity212 ) had expensive holidays growing up but wo n't be able to afford for their children to do the same when i look at their generation , i am green with envy			1
my in - laws still live in the detached , five - bedroom home in which my husband grew up			1
it is worth at least £ 1.2 million , but it set them back only £ 20,000			0
by the time they were my age , they had paid off their mortgage and sent both their boys to private school			1
fees have quadrupled since 1990 , from an average of £ 2,985 per year to £ 12,700 in 2014 - a prohibitive cost for most of my friends			0
my in - laws also enjoyed a luxurious lifestyle , going skiing and on exotic foreign holidays every year , and there was always a shiny sports car parked on the drive			0
nowadays such a lifestyle is restricted to @entity244 big shots and foreign billionaires , a fact that is reflected at my husband 's old school			1
where his contemporaries were the children of lawyers , doctors , teachers and journalists , now the pupils are the sons of celebrities and @entity258 oligarchs			1
i am aware that i may sound like a whining privileged woman who has failed to manage her money , but it is a bitter pill to swallow that @entity80 and i will never be able to provide our children with the lifestyle we enjoyed			0
it seems painfully ironic to me that as i step out of the eye - wateringly expensive ( £ 4,500 since you ask ) bifold doors , into my beautiful garden , that i ca n't afford to replace the boots that are letting in dew from the lawn thanks to the holes in both the soles			1
but this is the badge of the growing band of property - rich and cash - poor middle - class families who hide their struggles to stay afloat behind the shiny front doors of their beautiful homes .			1

@entity25 is a ' dumpy ' - downwardly mobile , urban and middle - aged
lives in a lavish house in @entity51 with her husband and four children
but she says they are not wealthy and struggle to pay the bills
her sons wo n't enjoy *trappings* of wealth she had growing up , she says
and she wo n't be able to afford to send them to private school
