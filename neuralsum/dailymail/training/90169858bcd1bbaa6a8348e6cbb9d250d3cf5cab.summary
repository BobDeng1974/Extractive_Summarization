a woman who spent years avoiding nights out because she felt frumpy next to her friends has lost nearly 6st to be named ' miss @entity4 '			1
at her heaviest @entity6 , 27 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , dreaded getting dressed up and would make excuses to stay home instead of socialising			1
now she 's dropped four dress sizes , going from a size 18 to a ten , and has been awarded the national title by weight - loss organisation @entity14			1
@entity6 says that when it came to catering for herself she would often resort to convenient but unhealthy options			1
' when i moved out of my mum and dad 's house into my own place , i found cooking for one tricky and would usually end up eating something made from a ready - made sauce that was enough for at least two people			1
' ' then boredom would set in and i 'd spend my evenings lounging in front of the tv grazing on crisps and sweets			2
i was stuck in a rut			2
' she soon became insecure with the way she looked and began to avoid social situations			2
' i used to come up with every excuse in the book not to join my friends on nights out because , while i loved spending time with them , i hated how i looked and felt			1
' @entity6 made it her @entity52 's resolution to fit into a size 10 so she ditched cakes and biscuits to reach her goal @entity6 became so embarrassed about her appearance that she chose to avoid nights out with friends in july 2013 , after confiding in her father how unhappy she was about her size , @entity6 became determined to make a change			1
' my poor mum and dad bore the brunt of my bad moods			2
i was really insecure about my appearance , i 'd get upset easily and my confidence was at an all - time low			0
' talking to my dad that day made me realise that the only thing standing in my way when it came to doing something about my weight was me			1
' just days later @entity6 joined her mum @entity75 at their local @entity76 in @entity78 in @entity79 run by consultant @entity80			1
although @entity6 had tried losing weight through the organisation before , she was determined that this time she would make a permanent change			1
' i 'd been to several @entity14 groups in the past and lost around a stone each time , but i never made a long - term commitment to it			1
' this time was different			0
i was n't just going to go to the group to get weighed , i knew i needed the help and support of @entity80 and the other members to reach my target			0
@entity6 now loves going shopping for new outfits , joining her friends on nights out and is now a keen runner ' there are so many characters in our group and i found i loved getting to know everyone , even now that i 'm at my target weight i still go each week			1
i always leave with a different recipe or piece of advice from someone in the group			0
' @entity6 , who works as a contracts coordinator for her family 's business , began following the club 's @entity115 healthy eating plan , and replaced store - bought dinners with home - cooked meals made from scratch including chilli con carne and @entity122 curries			1
she 's now expanded her cooking skills and regularly tries new recipes			0
' i 've always liked cooking but i used to make cakes and biscuits			0
nowadays i enjoy experimenting with savoury recipes and i love that with @entity14 you can always find a healthy alternative for whatever you fancy			0
' i cook for my friends and family a lot – they always ask for the recipes afterwards			0
' @entity6 says that despite her change of diet she is still able to enjoy the odd indulgence from time to time			1
@entity6 is 2015 's @entity138 , a prize given to the female slimmer who 's had the most inspirational transformation ' i think it 's been important for me that i can still have treats too , whether it 's a glass of wine with the girls or some chocolate at @entity149 , so i never feel like i ca n't live my life or like i 'm missing out			1
' as well as changing her eating habits , @entity6 took up running and started attending @entity153 classes			1
' before i lost weight it never occurred to me to do any real sort of activity			2
to be honest even the gentlest of exercise would probably have been a struggle			0
' i feel like a different person now			0
i have bucket loads more energy and i love putting on my fluorescents and going for a run on an evening			0
me and my best friend @entity166 completed the @entity18 half marathon in october – i could n't stop smiling after i crossed the finish line			0
' since first joining @entity169 's lost a total of 5st 12lbs , dropping from 15st 7½lb to 9st 9½lb			2
now she 's been named the club 's @entity138 2015 , an award for the female slimmer who 's had the most inspirational transformation , both inside and out			2
@entity6 says that she is thrilled with her new slender figure and now enjoys hunting for new outfits and regulary goes out with her friends			1

i still ca n't believe it when i go shopping and gorgeous crop tops , skinny jeans and slinky dresses fit me			0
' now i love dressing up and the girls know they can rely on me to be first on the dance floor			0
i finally feel like a normal 27 - year - old and i 'm loving it , in fact i joke i 'm reliving my teenage years ! ' she added that she is still in shock at the difference she has been able to make both to her body and her confidence			1
' the @entity149 before i joined @entity14 i wrote down some dream goals , like @entity52 's resolutions , one of which was to fit into a size 10			2
' ' it 's amazing to think this january i 've achieved that			0
