by @entity0 for @entity1 a working mother is today fighting cervical cancer after ignoring smear tests , because she was ' too busy ' juggling her job as a lawyer and life at home			1
@entity9 , from @entity10 , is receiving treatment for stage two - where stage four is the most severe - cervical cancer after doctors detected a tumour the size of a satsuma			1
the 38 - year - old has today urged other women not to ignore their smear tests , after admitting she struggled to find the time to attend her appointment			1
with two sons , @entity26 , five and @entity27 , two , as well as a part - time job as a medical lawyer , mrs @entity9 said she forgot to rebook her test			1
she told @entity1 : ' not going for a smear is my biggest regret ' now she has to wait until the end of december to find out if her treatment has worked			1
she told @entity1 : ' not going for a smear is my biggest regret			0
' my time outside work was hugely precious and not something to ' waste ' on things like visiting the doctor , particularly when i was feeling well			0
' although the firm i worked for would have had no issue with me taking time from work to attend a @entity37 appointment , i always had work that seemed to be a priority			2
' she urged other women to think before cancelling their smear tests , prioritising their health over their busy schedules			1
mrs @entity9 eventually visited the doctor this summer on the advice of her dentist husband , @entity39 , after noticing bleeding following sex			1
medics referred her to hospital and within three weeks she had been diagnosed with cervical cancer which had spread to connective tissues			1
mrs @entity9 is now undergoing chemo - radiation and brachytherapy ( internal radiotherapy ) because the tumour can not be safely removed through surgery			1
doctors have told her she has a 60 per cent survival rate over the next five years			2
' being given a four in 10 chance when you 've got two young children is devastating , ' mrs @entity9 , who studied at university in @entity10 , said			1
' i think my chance of survival would 've been much higher if i 'd had smears earlier			1
' but when you 're a mum with young children , unless there is something seriously wrong with you then you do n't focus on yourself			0
' i 've always been quite healthy so there 's an element of thinking cancer would never happen to me			2
i presumed a smear would be a waste of time , as in my mind it would certainly come back as negative			2
after visiting her gp , mrs @entity9 was referred to hospital and within three weeks tests revealed she had a tumour the size of a satsuma on her cervix ' now i might not see my children grow up			1
' i wo n't know if the treatment has worked until @entity108			1
' mrs @entity9 told how her last routine smear , which came back normal , took place in 2008 before having her son @entity26			1
in march 2013 , she received the usual reminder from her gp inviting her to make an appointment for another			2
mrs @entity9 did schedule a date with her doctor but subsequently cancelled it because of childcare arrangements			1
' i remember thinking i needed to rebook a smear , but i just did n't get round to it , ' she told @entity1			2
' mid 2013 i started noticing what i now know to be symptoms but did n't think anything of them at the time			0
' i 'd had a very watery discharge which i put down to post birth changes			0
' on a couple of occasions i had bleeding after sex but again did n't think an awful lot about it			0
' however , one weekend where there was a lot of blood my husband encouraged me to go to my gp			0
' the following day i felt my cervix and immediately thought it felt peculiar			0
' i went on @entity140 and searched ' mass on cervix '			0
at that point i had n't even considered cancer but the first thing that appeared in the search results was cervical cancer			1
' i read the symptoms associated with it and realised i had all of them			0
the following day i went straight to my gp			0
' on examining me , there was a lot of blood but the gp did try and put my mind at rest by stating that it was probably something benign			0
' mrs @entity9 is now undergoing chemo - radiation and brachytherapy ( internal radiotherapy ) because the tumour can not be safely removed through surgery			1
she has urged other women to make sure they make the time to have routine smear tests , adding : ' if i had a smear test early last year things would have been different ' a week later , mrs @entity9 attended the colposcopy clinic , and two weeks after that she received her diagnosis			1
' i was very matter - of - fact at first , ' she said			0
' i thought i was dealing with it well			0
but about a fortnight later i lost it			0
i worried i was n't going to be here			0
' i picked myself up and decided i have to get through it			0
the treatment was very intense and now it 's coming to an end			0
' i 'm likely to suffer the menopause early and suffer permanent changes to my bladder and bowel			0
' i 've always been fit			0
now i wo n't necessarily be able to play with the boys like i used to			1
' looking back i think i was foolish for putting off a smear			2
if i had a smear early last year things would have been different			2
' i initially put it off because i was busy			0
i thought , " i 'm never going to be diagnosed with cancer "			0
' but if you do n't go when prompted it 's easy to put off			0
bleeding after sex is a red flag for cervical cancer			1
' i think if employers shone a spotlight on cervical cancer prevention like they do , for example , eye tests and well woman programmes then i absolutely think i would have made it more of a priority			1
' mrs @entity9 has spoken out to encourage other women to make time for smears			1
she is supporting @entity204 to @entity205 – a cervical cancer awareness campaign set up by @entity207 and supported by @entity209 's @entity208			2
time to @entity205 calls on businesses to show their commitment to female employees having the flexibility to attend cervical screening during working hours if they are not able to get an appointment in their own time			2
ten businesses and professional organisations have already signed up to take the @entity204 to test pledge including global beauty brand @entity220 ( @entity221 ) and @entity222 – @entity222			0
around 3,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer every year in the @entity225 and the disease causes around 970 deaths annually			1
cervical screening aims to pick up and treat abnormal cells before they develop into cervical cancer and is estimated to save around 5,000 lives a year			1
statistics have shown that , apart from an increase in 2009 , the uptake of cervical screening has either fallen or remained unchanged for the past decade			0
around one in five women do not attend screening when invited and many delay it for more than a year			2
more than a quarter ( 26 per cent ) of women would be encouraged to attend if their company was more flexible and they did not have to take holiday for an appointment			0
it is estimated that early detection and treatment through cervical screening can prevent up to 75 per cent of cervical cancers from developing in the @entity225			2
not going for cervical screening is one of the biggest risk factors for developing cervical cancer			1
recent surveys by @entity209 's @entity208 reveal that only 16 per cent of women recognise non-attendance of cervical screening as a risk factor [ for cervical health problems ] and that on average young women delay screening for 15 months while 60 - 64 year olds delay for an average of 33 months			1
furthermore one in 10 said they had not attended a screening for over 10 years			0
@entity266 , chief executive of @entity209 's @entity208 said : ' the number of women delaying or ignoring their cervical screening invitation is now on the rise and worryingly cervical cancer incidence is also rising			1
' we know from our research that a barrier to attendance can be being able to take time off work and so it 's crucial that employers ensure their female staff are given time to attend what is a simple five minute test that could potentially save their lives			0
' we 're delighted that so many companies have already shown their commitment to cervical cancer prevention and hope that many more follow suit			2
