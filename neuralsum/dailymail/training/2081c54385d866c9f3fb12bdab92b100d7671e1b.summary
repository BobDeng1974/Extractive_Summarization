by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 outspoken : @entity3 said he was appalled that ' every single sphere of @entity6 influence ' was dominated by people who went to private school @entity6 is run by privately - educated elite , former prime minister sir @entity3 has warned in a dramatic warning about the difficulties for poor children to get on in life			1
the @entity15 grandee said the dominance of the wealthy and well - educated in the ‘ upper echelons ’ of public life was ‘ truly shocking ’			1
his remarks were seen as a thinly - veiled reference to the wealthy backgrounds of @entity23 's government , in contrast to sir @entity3 's own upbringing in a rented flat in @entity28 , @entity29			1
it is the second time in a month that sir @entity3 has spoken out about the dangers of out - of - touch well - heeled politicians indifferent to the needs of the poor			1
during a speech to the @entity36 on friday evening , sir @entity3 said : ‘ in every single sphere of @entity6 influence , the upper echelons of power in 2013 are held overwhelmingly by the privately educated or the affluent middle class			1
‘ to me , from my background , i find that truly shocking			0
’ @entity42 rejected the criticism , insisting policies to help people get on were more important than the background of politicians			0
mr @entity23 ’s official spokesman said the pm regularly speaks to @entity3			1
‘ at the heart of this is about the importance of building what the prime minister has decribed as an aspiration nation , ' the spokesman said			0
‘ i actually think that what people around their breakfast table in the morning , getting their kids ready for school … what they want to know is the government has the policies to ensure that their kids can fulfil their talents and ambitions			0
that ’s what is the most important thing			0
’ sir @entity3 blamed @entity68 for the ‘ collapse in social mobility ’ and the ‘ truly shocking ’ inequality in the @entity6			1
he criticised @entity79 's ‘ absurd mantra to be the one - nation party ’ , suggesting that ‘ they left a @entity74 divide between stagnation and aspiration ’			1
the 70 - year - old grew up in a rented flat in @entity28 and was educated in a comprehensive school where he attained three o - levels			1
despite his direct criticism of @entity68 policies during the speech at @entity36 ’s annual dinner , his comments are also likely to prove embarrassing for @entity23			1
the prime minister was educated at @entity90 and went on to study at @entity91			2
several senior members of the @entity93 , including chancellor @entity94 and @entity96 leader @entity95 , were privately educated , as was @entity29 mayor @entity97			2
sir @entity3 suggested that @entity6 institutions should return to a system whereby ‘ sheer hard graft ’ can lead to success , rather than having to rely on privilege			1
he said : ‘ i remember enough of my past to be outraged on behalf of the people abandoned when social mobility is lost			0
' our education system should help children out of the circumstances in which they were born , not lock them into the circumstances in which they were born			0
‘ we need them to fly as high as their luck , their ability and their sheer hard graft can actually take them			0
and it is n’t going to happen magically			0
’ his concerns echo those expressed by education secretary @entity119 – also educated at a state school – who suggested last year that ‘ progressive ’ education policies had damaged social mobility			2
embarrassing : both the current conservative prime minister , @entity23 , left , and his @entity96 deputy prime minister , @entity95 , right , as well as senior members of the cabinet , were privately schooled suggesting that the government needed to ‘ pull together ’ to win the next election , sir @entity3 also criticised the @entity129 ’s push for same - sex marriage			1
sir @entity3 , prime minister between 1990 and 1997 , said : ‘ social mores have moved on from the way in which we were brought up , with the values that we had			1
they have moved and changed			0
‘ and that is why issues such as gay marriage have proved so toxic for the @entity15			0
‘ for people like that , who form the bulk of our party and a great deal of our country too , these are difficult issues , these bewildering social changes , and mostly it is my generation and older who are unsettled by these changes			0
‘ we may be unsettled by them , but @entity23 and his colleagues have no choice but to deal with this new world			2
they can not @entity157 - like order it to go away because it wo n’t			2
’ sir @entity3 also said the @entity15 leadership should pull their punches on @entity162 , saying ‘ many of the @entity162 supporters are patriotic @entity6 who fear their country is changing ’ and who will come back to the @entity15 party			1
warning : sir @entity3 said successive governments had ignored the ' poor and near - poor ' last month sir @entity3 warned wealthy politicians from privileged backgrounds have a moral duty not to ‘ kick the ladder ’ away for those struggling to improve their lives			1
in a passionate speech standing up for the ‘ silent have - nots ’ , sir @entity3 pointedly drew on his own experience growing up in poor parts of @entity28			1
speaking to the parliamentary press gallery , sir @entity3 said there were too many people ‘ falling behind through no fault of their own ’			1
he added : ‘ they are white , black , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 – all of them			0
‘ they work hard , they obey the law , they hope for a better future and they live in every single constituency up and down the country			0
‘ and this trend of people falling behind in the modern world is one that we can not accept			0
’ he warned it was ‘ criminally easy ’ to overlook these ‘ silent citizens ’ because they do not ‘ make a fuss , they just get on with their lives ’			0
@entity3 added : ‘ they struggle to pay the bills often , they think carefully before having a family holiday			2
‘ if unemployed they seek work , if employed they work hard to hang on to their jobs			0
and how do i know about these people ? ‘ because i grew up with them			2
they were my neighbours , the silent have - nots			2
‘ they are not high - fliers , not financially secure			0
they ’re the dignified poor or near - poor and to the shame of decades of politicians – and i include myself in this – there are still millions and millions of them			2

sir @entity3 says @entity68 left ' @entity74 divide ' between rich and poor
but his comments will also embarrass to @entity90 - educated @entity23
sir @entity3 grew up in a flat in @entity29 and went to a comprehensive
