but fungus - farming ants use their house guests as a useful standing army to protect their colony against dangerous threats , scientists claim			1
@entity13 researchers studied ant warfare between three parties to discover that cohabiting guest colonies of ants can serve as an effective front line defense for a colony			1
here they go about their farming duties before any enemies arrive the invasion begins as a group of hostile ants enter the colony			0

while ants are unusually free of infectious diseases , their societies are often invaded by social parasites ; insects that exploit the resources of ant colonies for their own benefit and force the hosts to work harder			2
such lodgers escape detection by the social immune system of their hosts by producing bar - code like chemical recognition labels similar to the host 's own , while others use brute force or obnoxious chemicals to infiltrate or usurp host colonies			0
however , these unwelcome guests can come in useful for the host colony - despite the risk of being attacked from within - during times of great threats from the outside			0
more ants follow the impetuous scout into the colony and begin fighting the ants that live there			0
while ants are unusually free of infectious diseases , their societies are often invaded by social parasites ; insects that exploit the resources of ant colonies for their own benefit researchers from the @entity72 at the @entity73 at the @entity74 studied a colony of peaceful fungus - farming ants facing two natural enemies and reported the scenes were ' reminiscent of dramas in human history and literature '			1
raider ants , the genus @entity82 hartmani , seeking to enter the host 's home , favour a swift style of attack to kill defenders , plunder a nest and steal food to usurp the original colony in a style of warfare not dissimilar to @entity96 in the @entity97			2
but the attackers did not reckon on the fungus - farming ants having powerful protectors - the @entity101 guest ant parasite			2

without the help of fiercer house guests the gentle farmer ants are easily killed by the hostile invaders ( pictured ) the researchers said the @entity114 ants are the second natural enemy of the farmers and use alkaloid poison to permanently move in with a farming host colony to exploit its fungus farm at relative leisure			1
while these invader ants are a lifelong burden for the farmers , they can turn out to be a life - saving asset when mobile raiders threaten them , as the guest ants rise to the defense of their hosts			1
the scientists found that the guest ant defenses are so effective that they not only kill raiders , but their mere presence greatly decreases the probability of a raid			1
the researchers said house guest @entity114 ants are the second natural enemy of the farmers but while they are a lifelong burden for the farmers , they can turn out to be a life - saving asset when mobile raiders threaten them , as the guest ants rise to the defense of their hosts , pictured their study showed that scout ants planning an attack can detect whether or not a host colony has a cohabiting guest ant colony before deciding to initiate a raid so the guest ants serve as an effective front line defense			1
dr @entity155 , the lead author of the study published in @entity157 , said when a @entity114 worker discovered an invading raider , she quickly returned to the cavity to excite her sister workers , and one by one they came out , soon overpowering the invaders , so a raid was prevented			0
the results of the study help explain why the guest ant parasite is common in the @entity168 sites where the colonies were collected ; a very unusual situation as socially parasitic ants are normally very rare			2
here the house guest ants rush to defend their hosts and temporary home			2
the scientists found that the guest ant defenses are so effective that they not only kill raiders , but their mere presence greatly decreases the probability of a raid the study illustrates how sophisticated and subtle co-evolutionary processes driven by natural selection can be			1
the results not only show that the idea that ' the enemy of my enemy is my friend ' can work in the world of ants , but also that natural selection can maintain lesser evils when that helps prevent greater harm			1
dr @entity192 , who was also involved in the study , said these kinds of interaction - where being a foe or friend depends on a the presence of a third party - are probably far more common than we realise , and may be fundamental for the co-evolution of interacting species			0
here the house guest ant battles and eventually overpowers the raider			0
the study illustrates how sophisticated and subtle co-evolutionary processes driven by natural selection can be			0

@entity13 researchers studied ant warfare between three parties of ants to find parasitic guests can serve as a front line defense for a colony
the @entity74 research found guest ants kill raiders but their presence also decreases the chance of a raid in the first place
the research shows the idea that ' the enemy of my enemy is my friend ' can work in the world of ants , scientists said
