an illegal immigrant who committed ' revolting ' sex offences on the @entity2 could receive a £ 7,000 payout because he was kept in jail for ' too long ' while officials tried to deport him			1
@entity6 , who claims to be 34 and from @entity7 , was detained for more than four years while @entity9 officials fought for deportation , after he was convicted of sexually abusing two women on a rush - hour @entity13 train			1
but he has now won a @entity16 battle against home secretary @entity17 , after a judge ruled that he had been illegally held for seven months - against his human rights - during that process			1
@entity6 , who sexually assaulted two women on a rush - hour tube , could be awarded £ 7,000 after the @entity16 ( pictured ) ruled he was unlawfully held for ten months while officials tried to deport him deputy high court judge @entity22 said @entity6 's payout is yet to be assessed , giving no indication of what the figure would be			1
but according to human rights lawyers , the payout given to @entity6 could be between £ 5,000 and £ 10,000			2
in 2013 , a @entity30 judgment set a precedent that those detained illegally should receive around £ 1,000 for each month they are held against their human rights			0
it means @entity6 can expect to receive around £ 7,000			0
during today 's hearing in @entity2 , the court heard how @entity6 - who has failed in a bid to claim asylum - arrived in @entity40 from @entity7 in 1999 before moving to @entity41			1
he then moved to @entity42 , north @entity2			0
the court heard how , in november 2008 , @entity6 was given a three - year jail term for carrying out two sex assaults on the @entity2 , as well as possessing a false identity document			1
home secretary @entity17 ( pictured ) had claimed @entity6 was held because he posed a ' serious risk ' to the public but has lost the case @entity6 had pleaded guilty to the offences , after he pressed himself against the women on a crowded rush - hour train			1
the attacks had been witnessed by commuters and @entity6 was later traced using dna evidence and oyster card records			0
during the hearing over those offences , the court heard how the ' revolting ' sex attacks had had ' very lasting effects ' on the victims			0
judge @entity63 , who heard the case at @entity65 , said he would recommend deportation after he had served time in jail for the crimes			0
@entity6 was then released from jail in december 2009			2
following an order for his deportation , he was placed in immigration detention , while officials began the process			2
but he was released from immigration detention in march last year after attempts to deport him failed			1
he was made to wear a monitoring tag			0
after his release , @entity6 launched a legal battle , claiming he had been held in immigration detention when then was ' no prospect ' of him being deported			1
mrs may disputed his claim , saying he posed a ' serious risk of harm ' and that there was a ' serious risk ' that he would abscond			0
judge @entity22 ruled that detention had been lawful for the majority of the four years and four months @entity6 was held			1
but he ruled that the detention had been unlawful between mid-september 2013 and march last year			2
he said that , by that time , there had been ' no sufficient prospect of removal within a reasonable time '			0
during the 2013 case which set the precedent on the issue of payouts , the @entity94 held that the secretary of state had breached the human rights of mr @entity101 by keeping him in detention for 10 months longer than necessary			2
mr @entity101 was serving a life sentence but had brought the case over the delay in reviewing the need for his further detention , on the grounds of whether it was necessary for public protection			0
the secretary of state was ordered to pay him £ 10,000 in damages , setting a precedent of around £ 1,000 in damages per month held unlawfully .			0

@entity6 , from @entity7 , was convicted in 2008 of assaulting two women
after his release , he was put in detention while officials tried to deport him
but 34 - year - old was released in march last year after deportation failed
he has now won @entity16 battle because he was held for seven months too long
