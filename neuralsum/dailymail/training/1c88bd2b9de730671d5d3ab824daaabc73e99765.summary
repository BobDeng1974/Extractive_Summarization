by @entity0 published : 01:42 est , 8 july 2013 updated : 08:12 est , 8 july 2013 @entity1 , the one - time @entity2 governor who resigned in disgrace after his involvement with high - price call girls became public in 2008 , is getting back into politics			1
his bid to become @entity2 's next comptroller will be complicated , however : one of the two most prominent candidates opposing him is @entity11 , the madam who spent three months in prison for running the prostitution ring that counted @entity1 among its clients			1
and with that announcement sunday evening , the entire city of @entity2 collectively set its dvrs to record what would otherwise be a boring autumn debate			2
@entity1 , who spent roughly $ 80,000 on prostitutes before his political work came crashing down five years ago , told @entity22 that he plans to use the comptroller 's office to audit city agencies , citing ' critical issues of judgment if we are spending our dollars wisely			1
' he will need to collect 3,750 signatures from @entity2 voters by july 11 - just four days away - to put his name on the ballot			2
i am going to be on the street corners , ' @entity1 told the @entity35 without a hint of irony			0
' we will be out across the city			0
@entity11 ( r ) was the madam who supplied him with prostitutes			2
they 're both running for @entity2 comptroller @entity51 was @entity1 's favorite call girl			1
the two romped in room 817 of the @entity54 in @entity55 on several occasions , according to federal court documents @entity58 , a former hedge fund manager - turned - madam , announced her candidacy for the same post in april , and won the endorsement of the @entity63 to fly its banner on @entity65			1
' bring it on , ' she told reporters when the news broke			0
' gosh , it ’s going to be a fun race ! ' @entity71 has already said she plans to make @entity1 's past association with her ladies of the evening a central campaign issue , saying that ' it would be a disgrace for the @entity2 to allow an unpunished criminal who committed multiple felonies to be re-elected back into office			1
' she tweeted a reminder on sunday evening that it was @entity1 who , as governor in 2007 , signed a bill into law that ' made it a felony 4 a man to use prostitutes			2
' ' not that i think that should be criminal but he sure did			0
' @entity94 's @entity94 tweeted what many pundits are thinking			0
other tweets predicted a @entity99 run for @entity100 @entity102 's @entity101 offered help to @entity105 's joke writers , who will soon be competing with the rest of the late - night universe to find new ways to poke fun at @entity2 's political scene former @entity112 press secretary @entity111 represented @entity113 for more than two years			1
his critics would say he knows a thing or two about laughing stocks @entity71 ' illicit operation , the @entity118 , attracted the attention of federal law enforcement , which caught @entity1 on a wiretap arranging a sex - for - pay session in @entity55 with a woman whose stage name was @entity51			1
' i have acted in a way that violates my obligations to my family and violates my - or any - sense of right or wrong , ' @entity1 finally said in a short speech , after media reports identified him as a man referred to in court documents only as ' client 9			0
' after federal authorities determined that he never used use public money or campaign funds to pay for his romps , @entity1 never faced criminal charges			0
but room 871 at the tony @entity54 in @entity55 , where he spent 1,000 per hour for his sexcapades , has become a minor tourist attraction			1
@entity1 's brethren : former @entity144 governor @entity143 ( @entity43 ) won his race for @entity146 after an affair with his now - fiancee @entity148			1
@entity150 ( r ) , posing with a drag queen during @entity2 's gay pride parade , resigned from @entity146 after long denying that he tweeted inappropriate photos of himself the @entity54 in @entity55 was @entity1 's preferred home - away - from - home when he enjoyed the company of $ 1,000 - per - hour prostitutes the 2009 documentary ' client 9 : the @entity160 of @entity1 ' tells the story of the governor 's fall from grace , and the corporate titans who were happy to see him self - destruct the @entity167 's political establishment is already reeling from the specter of an @entity150 victory in the @entity171 mayoral primary , which would make him a heavy favorite to claim @entity173 in the fall			1
@entity150 , far less famous for his time in @entity146 than for tweeting photos of himself in various states of undress to young women who were not his newlywed wife , has seized on the mayoral race as a platform for redemption in a city known for its hard - nosed politics and an anything - goes election philosophy			1
polls show @entity150 running close to the top of the @entity171 pack , jockeying for position with @entity192 , the @entity171 speaker of @entity2 's city council			2
earlier this year , @entity195 former @entity144 governor @entity143 made his own phoenix - rising - from - the - ashes bid with a surprise win in a congressional special election , just four years after his extramarital affair seemed to tank his political career for good			2
@entity204 president @entity203 dropped out of the mayoral race to run for comptroller instead , but with @entity1 and his millions now in play , he 's no longer a lock to win @entity1 co-hosted a short - lived @entity208 show with @entity210 columnist @entity209			1
originally called ' @entity212 , ' it was renamed ' in @entity213 ' when @entity214 left four months after it debuted			0
the show was canceled after less than nine months on the air @entity204 president @entity203 was considered the odds - on favorite to win the controller 's race before @entity1 entered the fray on sunday			2
his campaign came out swinging within an hour of @entity1 's announcement			2
' @entity203 has a proven record of results and integrity and entered this race to help @entity2 ’s middle class regain its footing , ' said @entity203 campaign manager @entity230			0
' by contrast , @entity1 is going to spurn the campaign finance program to try and buy personal redemption with his family fortune			0
' @entity1 is expected to self - finance his bid for comptroller - ' he apparently likes to pay for it , ' quipped a series of tweeters on sunday - using a real estate fortune that includes office buildings along the @entity244 seaboard from @entity2 to @entity55			1
those properties include two @entity247 apartment buildings within blocks of each other on swanky @entity250 : one where @entity1 lived for years with his wife @entity251 , and another where his father lives			0
the @entity253 reported in may that the former governor was actually living in the second building , away from his wife			0
presaging an awkward wife - to - wife phone call , @entity253 columnist @entity257 tweeted his gleeful imagination of a conversation in which the spouses of @entity150 and @entity1 compare notes @entity265 exploded sunday evening after @entity1 entered the comptroller race , but former madam @entity11 may have the last laugh at the debate as late - night joke writers and newspaper headline gurus ponder their good fortune , @entity2 can expect to relive the 2008 @entity1 episode , with all its tawdry underpinnings , between now and november			1
that includes the money , the sex , the sensationalized downfall , and even the mid-calf black socks that he allegedly declined to take off during his encounters with prostitutes			0
but even with the possibility of @entity2 's top two officeholders sporting the names @entity150 and @entity1 , the newer candidate has so far refused to draw any lines of connection between his situation and @entity150 's			1
' i do n't draw conclusions from anyone else 's dynamic or situation , ' he told the @entity292			0
' the more people get into politics , the healthier it is			0
i hope the public gives me a fair shot			0

@entity1 will run for @entity2 comptroller against @entity11 , the former madam who hooked him up with $ 1,000 - per - hour sex romps
the @entity2 governor resigned in 2008 after the feds caught him on a wiretap arranging for an *expensive* tryst in @entity55 's @entity54
@entity1 joins @entity150 on the ballot - the former congressman who tweeted photos of his barely - clothed private parts to young women
@entity71 spent months in prison while @entity143 was never charged . she says she 's looking forward to confronting him during a fall debate
