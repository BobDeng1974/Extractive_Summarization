it was towed four miles into @entity90 where today it was hoisted onto the quayside ( pictured ) by a crane in front of the excited team of archaeologists @entity117 , a senior lecturer in marine archaeology at @entity54 , said : ' before now we had just seen the rudder underwater where you could only make out a few feet of it at a time			1
' so to see it in day light in all its glory is really quite spectacular			0
' it is a very large and impressive item itself so you can imagine how spectacular this merchant vessel would have looked			0
' its discovery is an extremely significant one and has given way to one of the largest shipwreck investigations within the @entity135			0
' another carving previously discovered at the wreck of the @entity11 trading ship near @entity12 , @entity13 unlike the @entity20 , little is known of the @entity61 , including its identity			1
tests on the oak wood from it have dated the felling of the timber to 1628 and from forests on the @entity11 / @entity147 border			1
analysis of some of the recovered artefacts date to the middle of the 17th century			2

it was making a statement , showing how great and wonderful the owners were			0
mr @entity53 said the ship could be compared to a 17th century version of the luxurious @entity185 liner , although the @entity185 was ornate for passengers , and not just for those viewing the ship			0
a carving of a merman is pictured ( right ) and ( wreckage ) left ' they would have been a large @entity11 conglomerate , similar to the @entity193			2
' it would not have been a million miles from a 17th century version of the @entity185 , although the @entity185 was ornate for the passengers and not for those on the outside			0

archaeologists believe the ship was a sign of prestige and wealth			2
it was making a statement , showing how great and wonderful the owners were by including lavish baroque carvings such as the one pictured , for example ' it was either going out or coming back when it sank outside of @entity90			1
' we have received a grant to fund the recovery all the material that is at risk of erosion			0
' so far the team has brought up artefacts including five baroque carvings , ceramic pieces , leather shoes , copper and pewter plates and cups and a bronze compass divider			1

mr @entity239 ( pictured ) said he has no idea who the male carving on the rudder might be but thinks as it is a moustachioed man with a classical helmet on , it is depicting a military man of some sort mr @entity53 said : ' last month we spent seven days excavating beneath the rudder in order to put strops around it and lift it into a steel frame			0
