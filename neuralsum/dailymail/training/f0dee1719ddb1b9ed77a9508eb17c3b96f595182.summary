the admitted killer ’s five guns - including an @entity11 assault - style rifle , a shotgun and three handguns - were cataloged by @entity14 ( @entity16 ) police during a domestic dispute last year with girlfriend @entity18			1
a police report obtained by @entity20 showed the handguns were fully loaded when cops arrived on the scene , and @entity18 said he brandished his shotgun when she started moving belongings out of the home the two share			1
the report showed @entity4 owns semi-automatic @entity11 , a @entity32 12 - gauge shotgun , a @entity34 handgun , a @entity36 9mm handgun , a @entity38 handgun , more than 100 rounds of ammunition and countless gun holsters and bags			1
authorities seized the gun collection after @entity18 called 911 on last november telling the dispatcher that her infamous flame was pointing a gun at her and had smashed a glass coffee table when she said she was leaving him			1
@entity4 ‘ grabbed the shotgun out of the case , ’ she told police , according to the report			1
‘ @entity4 then pointed the shotgun at her and asked , ‘ do you really want to do that ? ’ when she said she was calling 911 , the report said			2
he ‘ struck a glass top table in the living room using the butt of the shotgun , causing it to shatter , ’ according to the report			0
@entity4 then slung the shotgun ‘ over his shoulder … pushed her out of the house and locked the door behind her , ’ the report said			2
police arrested the unstable former neighborhood watchman and charged him aggravated assault , domestic violence and battery			0
authorities issued a restraining order against @entity4 after @entity78 further accused him of choking her during a subsequent interview with investigators , but she later dropped all charges and claimed she had been ‘ intimidated ’ by police			1
back together : the couple was back together and pictured smiling when picking up the guns only weeks later a friend of @entity18 ’s told @entity86 at the time that loved ones feared for her safety			2
‘ we would all talk about where the relationship was going , and we knew it would end badly , ’ the woman said			0
‘ he is just a time bomb waiting to go off			0
' those sentiments were also echoed last year by both his estranged wife @entity97 , who also called him a ' monster , ' and @entity14 police chief @entity100			0
@entity100 famously agreed with a local ’s comparison of the risk posed by @entity4 to @entity105 shooter @entity103			0
back in the news : both @entity4 and rapper @entity107 found themselves in the headlines last month when a planned boxing match between the two was cancelled the smiling couple was the picture of happiness when seen a few weeks later leaving a local police department after picking up the guns			2
@entity4 was most recently in the news after a planned ‘ celebrity boxing match ’ between he and rapper @entity107 was scuttled when scores of people complained about him fighting a black man on national television			0
the crux of his defense for shooting the unarmed @entity126 , 17 , was that he could n’t defend himself against the teen			0
he also said was also forced to flee a @entity128 after people accosted him and a $ 10,000 bounty was placed on his head			0
heavy firepower : a simple attachment to the @entity11 owned by @entity4 ( similar to the one at left ) allows it to legally fire 900 rounds per minute , and the shotgun is powerful enough to take down a fully grown deer concealed carry : @entity4 also owns two pistols like the @entity38 ( left ) and the @entity138 ( right ) above , both can easily be carried by the owner in a manner that others can see			1

@entity4 owns an @entity11 , a 12 - gauge shotgun , three handguns and has well over 100 rounds of ammunition
all were loaded when police arrived at his home after a november 911 call by girlfriend @entity18
they were *returned* within weeks after she dropped assault charges against him
