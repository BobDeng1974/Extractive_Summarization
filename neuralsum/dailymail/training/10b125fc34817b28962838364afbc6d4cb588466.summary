@entity1 fans should get down to @entity2 on a thursday night			1
they should make an atmosphere , make it unplayable for the visitors and replicate the feel of those @entity8 nights			0
why ? because by far their best chance of reliving them - those wins over @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 - is winning the @entity16			2
every @entity16 game from here on in is more important than the @entity20			0
@entity1 thrashed @entity21 in the @entity16 but @entity2 was far from full managers will never admit to prioritising a cup over the league ; some are bold enough to admit vice versa			1
but for @entity28 , their best chance of reaching the @entity8 is by lifting the @entity16 in @entity29 in may			2
with @entity1 ’ quality individuals and strength in depth , the competition is winnable			0
the @entity35 boss has made 42 changes in their five @entity38 games so far this term , but do n’t be fooled into thinking he has selected weaker teams			0
@entity1 manager @entity28 rang the changes but fielded an experienced line - up follow all the latest # @entity16 action on : - @entity45 - @entity44 - @entity47 - @entity46 - website - @entity48 he brought in @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 on thursday night after the 4 - 1 defeat to @entity57			1
that ’s six players with 197 international caps			0
@entity2 was only 60 per cent full for the visit of @entity21 , but for £ 25 an adult , £ 5 a junior and a superb £ 50 family deal for four tickets , those who stayed at home missed out on value for money			1
first , there was @entity72 ’s ludicrous goal , surely the most skilful and audacious finish seen in this part of north @entity75 for years			0
@entity72 scored a brilliant goal for @entity1 with a perfectly - executed ' rabona ' @entity72 watches as his shot heads for the net as @entity1 cruised to victory @entity72 showed glimpses of his ability but the youngster has yet to display it week in , week out then youngster @entity54 , proving once again he is a huge prospect ( not between the sticks ) with a striker ’s hat - trick			1
@entity72 ’s blistering second and @entity90 ’ world class save , before being sent off , completed a night of superlatives			2
@entity1 fans were truly entertained for only the second time this season against the team who had previously topped the group , and qualification to the knockout stages should follow for @entity28			2
their league form is less to shout about			0
inconsistency has plagued @entity1 in recent years , but the @entity16 is a maximum 17 - game tournament that essentially bypasses the rigours of the @entity20			1
@entity54 scored a hat - trick to keep up his impressive form in @entity48 this season but the youngster fumbled a free kick into his own net after replacing @entity90 who was sent off of course , winning it is no simple task			1
three of the last six winners had been filtered out from the @entity8 group stages , and that is a road block still to come for those gaining confidence in the pre-knockout rounds			0
but @entity1 proved on thursday night that when the nuts and bolts fit together , they ’re a fine team to watch and unstoppable going forward			1
the fans must do all they can to believe the @entity16 lifeline can be grabbed with both hands on the trophy			2
follow all the latest # @entity16 action on @entity47 and at @entity48			0

@entity1 beat @entity21 5 - 1 on thursday night in @entity16
@entity54 grabbed a hat - trick and @entity72 scored two stunners
but only *21,428* fans turned up at @entity2 , despite reduced prices
the @entity16 is the *gateway* to the @entity8 this season
