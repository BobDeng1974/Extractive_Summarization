by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor vulnerable pensioners may be at risk of poor care and even abuse because so many home helps can not speak @entity7 properly , a government adviser warned yesterday			1
agencies must ensure care workers have decent language skills before placing them in people ’s homes , she said			1
one in five carers is a migrant , according to research by @entity17			2
in some cities , it is thought around half of care workers are foreign nationals			1
dr @entity22 said that if carers can not speak @entity7 properly , they risk being badly treated by patients dr @entity22 , scientific adviser to the @entity26 , said changes to immigration policy and the relaxation of @entity31 labour rules has altered the profile of migrants who work as carers in the @entity35			1
many agencies do not adequately test language skills during interviews – leading to risks that the elderly could become victims of ‘ bad treatment ’ , she said			2
while migrants from outside the @entity31 are subject to rigorous language tests , this is not the case for those who come from within it			2
more and more care workers are now from @entity31 accession countries such as @entity50 and @entity51 , where no language testing is required			1
dr @entity53 told the @entity54 : ‘ this means new migrants can be vulnerable when they ’re placed in people ’s homes – and carers have reported instances of racism and discrimination that stem from communication problems			1
‘ it would be really beneficial to have a standard interview process to establish @entity7 language proficiency , communication skills and softer skills of all care workers aiming to work in the sector			1
‘ at the moment , vulnerable workers are placed in the homes of vulnerable adults with complex needs , and sometimes communication problems can result in bad treatment for both parties			0
’ prime minister @entity79 told the @entity80 that he wanted to make sure people in the care system are properly trained one man , who wishes to remain anonymous , has a 62 - year - old brother with a severe form of dementia			2
he employed carers for 18 months to oversee the care of his brother , but grew frustrated with the quality of the staff			1
he told 5 @entity92 the situation grew so problematic he took the decision to put his brother in a care home			2
‘ the dynamic between the carers and a frightened man who was suffering with dementia did n’t work most of the time , ’ he said			2
‘ almost all the carers were from overseas , mainly from @entity50			0
i found some of them exceptionally difficult to understand , which meant my brother , in his condition , was never going to understand them and the reaction from him was to hide or get slightly violent			0
’ dr @entity53 , of @entity17 ’s social care workforce research unit , added : ‘ in the majority , migrant workers are very hard - working , but sometimes when their @entity7 language is quite poor , that can put both carers and the user in very vulnerable situations – especially if they are the only carer			1
‘ interview standards are variable			0
we heard from care workers who admitted that their @entity7 is not very good , and the interview process is quite easy			0
’ under @entity121 right to freedom of movement rules , it would be considered a breach to prevent someone taking a job on the basis of their language alone			0
the @entity54 spoke to some former care workers from @entity51 , who told of their struggles to communicate with clients			0
@entity133 , who came to the @entity35 in 2008 , said : ‘ to do the job you have to understand the doctor ’s instructions , report to relatives and speak to agencies			1
‘ you have to help clients do things they ca n’t do for themselves , and it ’s essential to understand their instructions			0
‘ i remember once i worked with a wheelchair user			0
i had to strap him in the car			0
unfortunately i could n’t understand the exact instructions and we had to stay at home and could n’t go anywhere			0
i felt partly embarrassed and partly frustrated			0
’ but @entity151 , of the @entity35 @entity152 , which represents care agencies , said there was not enough money for language training because of council cuts			1
the government is bringing in a new ‘ care certificate ’ to ensure carers have the necessary skills			1
care minister @entity162 added : ‘ employers are responsible for recruiting staff who can competently speak and read @entity7 but communication will be a key part of the @entity167			0

dr @entity22 warns language *barriers* could lead to poor care
claims foreign carers can be at risk of abuse from their own patients
half of carers working in the @entity35 are thought to be foreign nationals
