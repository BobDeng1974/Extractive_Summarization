@entity1 apples were found to contain high levels of a compound that promotes good bacteria in the gut , helping people feel fuller for longer an apple a day keeps the doctor away , goes the saying			1
but a new study has found more specifically , that a @entity1 a day could be the key to preventing obesity			1
the bright green , crisp variety helps people feel full , inhibiting the urge to eat			0
they were found to promote friendly bacteria , which invokes the feeling of being full			2
the study , published in the journal @entity20 , revealed that the non digestible compounds in the fruit , which include fibre and polyphenols , do not get broken down by stomach acid			0
when they reach the colon they are fermented by bacteria in the colon which helps friendly bacteria in the gut to grow			2
scientists at @entity34 tested several different varieties of apple on mice , to see which caused the most growth of friendly bacteria			1
@entity1 worked better than @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and other popular varieties , they discovered			2
the variety , known for its slightly tart flavour , had a particularly high fibre content and compounds like polyphenols which do not break down when eaten , they reported			0
the team analysed mouse droppings after feeding the animals , some of which were obese , different types of fruit			0
they discovered the balance of bacteria in the colon of obese people is often ' disturbed ' in a way that can disrupt the metabolism and make people feel hungry			1
it was revealed that the faeces of overweight mice that had eaten @entity1 apples had changed and become similar to that of slim mice			0
the discovery could lead to future treatments for weight problems			0
professor @entity75 , from @entity34 said : ' we know that , in general , apples are a good source of these non digestible compounds but there are differences in varieties			1
' results from this study will help consumers to discriminate between apple varieties that can aid in the fight against obesity			0
' the non digestible compounds in the @entity1 apples actually changed the proportions of fecal bacteria from obese mice to be similar to that of lean mice			1
' the discovery could help cut disorders linked to obesity , including low grade inflammation			0
' what determines the balance of bacteria in our colon is the food we consume , ' said professor @entity75			2
scientists at @entity34 believe the findings might help combat obesity			1

scientists at @entity34 found @entity1 contain high levels of a compound which promotes good bacteria in the gut
balance of bacteria in the gut is determined by the food a *person* consumes
*researchers* believe the apple could help cut obesity *-* related illnesses
in obese people gut bacteria is often ' disturbed ' encouraging hunger pangs
