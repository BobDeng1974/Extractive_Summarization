by @entity0 published : 13:27 est , 31 january 2014 updated : 14:25 est , 31 january 2014 @entity2 , who was suspended from @entity3 in @entity4 , has pocketed £ 43,000 of taxpayers money since she was suspended last year a headmistress who was excluded from an all - girls school after it was named and shamed by parents as a ' real life @entity10 ’s ' has received £ 43,000 of taxpayers ' money since she was suspended , it emerged today			1
@entity2 , 54 , was suspended on full pay last july from her £ 86,300 - a - year job at @entity16 in @entity4 after a damning report exposed a ' core ' of unruly students			1
a snap inspection found some of the pupils were involved in a string of bullying incidents as well as reports of brawling , food fights , swearing at teachers , smoking and truancy			1
the school was also placed in special measures after the inspectors gave it a grade 4 rating - the worst it can possibly give out - branding it ' inadequate ' and ' requiring improvement			2
' the verdict led to comparisons to the fictional @entity10 's school for girls - originally created by a cartoonist in the 1940s which later became the subject of hit movies			1
but six months her suspension , a disciplinary inquiry into mrs @entity2 is yet to be resolved and she is currently still receiving her full salary while being on gardening leave			1
so far , the headmistress has earned £ 43,000 as the inquiry continues			1
today a row broke out about the payments to mrs @entity2 who is head at 990 pupil school where the motto is : ' more opportunities to succeed			1
' @entity55 mp @entity54 , many of whose constituents attend @entity3 , previusly raised the school ’s problems with education minister @entity60			0
he said he ‘ could n’t understand ’ why mrs @entity2 ’s suspension had still not been resolved , adding : ' it appears the council are burying their head in the sand and paying people to remain on gardening leave , spending money they ca n’t afford			1
' local @entity55 councillor @entity55 added : ' i understand that due process needs to be followed , but this needs to be dealt with in a timely fashion			0
' every day , week , month that it goes by unresolved it is costing taxpayers thousands of pounds			0
it is for the benefit of the suspended individuals , staff and indeed pupils and parents that this is dealt with and not ignored			2
' the investigation last year came after the school announced plans it was spending £ 220,000 buying @entity86 for every pupil to help with homework - and ' engage ' with all 80 of the school 's teachers			1
the ipad 4 model currently retails for £ 389 although school managers managed to haggle down the price to £ 220 per unit			2
@entity16 , where an inspection found pupils were starting food fights , had brawls and refused to go to lessons the school was inspected after it announced it would provide @entity86 for teachers and pupils the inspection discovered some pupils were scared for their safety while at school - and others were taking part in brawls , fights , smoking on school grounds and refusing to go to lessons			1
one girl tearaway was thrown out of class more than 80 times with others sent out 30 times			0
there was also a race - fuelled mass brawl between two gangs of girls , investigators found			1
one large group of girls gathered in the playground and only dispersed once a police officer had been called to stand amongst them			2
inspectors from @entity129 found eight pupils had been expelled in less than a year			2
they said there was a ' rapid deterioration ' in behaviour in a few months			0
the inspectors also warned white @entity136 girls were ' underachieving ' at the school where pupils are predominantly @entity139 and speak @entity140 as a second language			2
@entity129 called the unannounced inspection on july 3 after a parent complained about the behaviour of pupils			1
three inspectors spoke to 100 girls and observed 19 lessons and break times and read 16 responses to a survey			2
their report found behaviour had declined sharply since a previous inspection in which inspectors originally said students were ' courteous , polite and generally cheerful towards adults , visitors and each other			2
' the pupils ' bad behaviour led to comparisons to the fictional @entity10 's school - which featured in the 2007 film starring @entity163 in the report the inspectors said : ' there has been a rapid deterioration in behaviour			1
a core group of students has disengaged from their education and show no respect for teachers or their fellow students			0
' they cause widespread disruption to learning and an unsafe learning environment resulting in eight permanent exclusions in the academic year to date			0
' responses from parents show that approximately one third of parents disagree that their child feels safe in school and approximately half disagree that the school ensures students are well behaved			0
' behaviour logs from this year show regular reports of unacceptable behaviour including students truanting from lessons , leaving the school site , refusing to go to lessons , smoking , and swearing at teachers			1
' some students have been removed from lessons over 30 times this year and one student more than 80 times - a clear illustration that the behaviour system is not working			1
' many students have no confidence in the ability of the school to combat bullying effectively			0
consequently , some bullying goes unreported and is allowed to continue			0
mp @entity54 said he ¿ couldn ¿ t understand ¿ why mrs @entity214 s suspension had still not been resolved ' many students feel unsafe in school due to a wide variety of intolerable behaviours including , fighting , congestion and pushing on the stairs , teachers leaving classes unattended , teachers behaving aggressively towards students ; and food and drinks being thrown			1
' the majority of students behaved well in front of inspectors			0
other students were observed at lunch - time , throwing drinks , congregating in a big group , swearing , talking and filming on mobile phones			0
' the big group of students only dispersed once a number of staff had spoken to them and the police officer stood in the middle of them			0
' leaders and managers do not effectively prevent bullying and many students spoken to by inspectors feel that staff are unable to protect them and control those whose behaviour is disruptive and dangerous			0
' the report says most senior leaders at the school were ‘ unaware ’ of the scale of the bullying and had ' an over generous ' view of the quality of teaching due to inaccurate feedback from staff			0
it went on : ' teaching is often not good enough , giving rise to the underachievement of white @entity136 girls and students who are disabled or have special educational needs			0
a scene from the 1954 film @entity269			0
the school - home to numerous unruly school girls - has featured in scores of adaptations since it was first published as a comic in the 40s ' a number of students are unable to explore their learning independently of teachers because they do not have a strong grasp of @entity140			1
this is compounded by the fact that not all teachers are sufficiently confident in integrating literacy support into their teaching			0
' furthermore , some students who do have a good grasp of @entity140 have insufficient understanding of specialist vocabulary used by the teacher , which excludes them from learning			0
' a spokesman for @entity4 council said : ' suspension is a neutral act pending the outcome of investigation into the matters leading up to it			0
' it ’s therefore standard employment practice that a suspended individual continues to be paid by their employer until the matter has been resolved			1
' the case comes as it emerged @entity308 , head of neighbouring @entity310 college in @entity311 , has been paid £ 56,000 since being suspended in june after falling out with his school ’s governing body			2
before her suspension mrs @entity2 had been praised by council bosses for saving the local library from closure by offering to use it daily as a ' satellite school ' for youngsters who need extra teaching - and pay for the upkeep .			1
