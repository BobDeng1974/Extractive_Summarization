the final scoreline suggested otherwise			0
yet for @entity2 there were spells of a 6 - 1 thrashing of @entity5 which felt like a form of misery			1
as rain and wind swirled around the @entity11 the @entity8 endured an unexpectedly jittery , uncomfortable first half			0
@entity5 , a @entity13 of 30,000 residents rejected by @entity15 and playing in their first @entity17 qualification campaign , reacted to @entity19 's opening penalty by equalising within 60 seconds			1
it was their first ever goal in a competitive international			1
@entity2 praised the performance of @entity5 after @entity25 beat them 6 - 1 on sunday @entity27 ( second right ) scored @entity5 's first international goal 72 seconds after @entity25 went ahead @entity27 's goal sparked jubilant celebrations from @entity5 's players as @entity33 was stunned ' i have to say that all the credit should really go to @entity5 , ' said @entity2 afterwards			1
' they made my life a misery for periods of that game			1
they made it a long game for me as a coach , so well done to them			1
' but also well done to my players because there were players out there who personally were n't having a great game but they stuck at it			2
' we had some good chances and never took them			0
it was nice to see @entity55 score a hat - trick i thought he was one of our better players today			2
' of late @entity55 has been the subject of unwelcome headlines			0
pictured posing beside a £ 200,000 lamborgini shortly after @entity62 had lost 4 - 0 to @entity63 the striker had managed just four goals all season			2
at international level his last strike was in a 2 - 1 win over @entity71 in april 2009			1
' some of his touches were lovely today , ' said @entity2			1
' i was wanting more balls in the first half played through but @entity19 , @entity55 , @entity77 were marked and wanted balls played through			0
' we played square too many times because they were ready for it and wanted it			0
' we have people who can turn so i was a wee bit disappointed with that as well			0
striker @entity55 ( right ) led @entity25 to victory against @entity5 with a hat - trick @entity55 was recently mocked on @entity88 for buying a @entity89 after inconsistent form for @entity62 @entity55 is the first @entity25 player to score three goals in a game since @entity93 in 1969 ' to be fair the conditions were not great either			1
' it was swirling out there			0
@entity97 and @entity98 had problems with the swirling wind in the first half			0
' @entity97 , the young @entity103 full - back was dragged out of position when @entity5 ' s @entity105 wrote himself into the annals in the 19th minute			1
opting to play with a three - man defence – with just @entity108 at the centre - strachan admitted the system had worked less well than he anticipated			2
' it did get us four goals , but i was expecting that system to work a lot better than that but the goal sort of threw us a bit			2
within any system you are hoping your players will play to a level but in the first ten minutes we gave the ball away eight or nine times , that 's too much at international level no matter who you are against			1
' the campaign comes down now to @entity131 in @entity132 on june 13 , a huge game in every sense			2
win at the @entity135 and a play - off place – at least – becomes more likely than not			2
' after five games and performances i am delighted with we are here and we have ten points , i think we are all happy with that			0
we can go into the second half of this group feeling quite good about ourselves			0
' i look back at the performances and i think four so far have been terrific			0
' this was not one of our best but we got through			0
' we scored six goals and if we had woken up this morning and said we would score six we would have settled for that			0
' i would n't have wanted the one against us , but that 's the way football works some times			0
' so it 's been a good old day for everybody today			0
' @entity5 got their first goal and unfortunately @entity157 will always be that name now who is the subject of quiz questions everywhere			1
' @entity25 boss @entity2 ( right ) said he is delighted with 10 points from their first five qualifying games @entity19 scored two penalties for @entity25 against @entity5 at @entity33 on sunday @entity164 striker @entity77 ( right ) was also on the scoresheet in a big win for @entity25 despite the scoreline interm @entity5 coach @entity167 can point to the goal his side scored as evidence of improvement			1
they host @entity25 in the @entity173 in the final round of fixtures and @entity167 says : ' as a @entity176 , it 's a horrible thought - but we might just be the ones who get the result that spoils my country 's party			1
' they come to us in the last game and although i 'm not naive enough to say we ' ll beat them , if @entity25 are under pressure to get a result , who knows ? '			1

@entity25 beat @entity5 6 - 1 in @entity192 2016 qualifying on sunday
@entity5 levelled the scores with their first ever international goal
@entity2 praised @entity5 's performance level after the game
