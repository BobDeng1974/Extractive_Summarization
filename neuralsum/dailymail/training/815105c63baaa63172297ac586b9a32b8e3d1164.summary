the prime minister will use a speech to global business leaders in @entity29 tomorrow to make clear @entity6 is open for business			2
he is expected to trumpet that the coalition is cutting corporation tax rates to just 20 per cent , the lowest in the @entity33 , tearing up red tape and investing billions in infrastructure to attract more firms			0
mr @entity5 will seek to counter the negative messages emerging from the pac which has resonated around the world			2
after a @entity16 source told @entity2 there is ' no doubt ' the attacks are having an impact on business , the @entity39 warned mps against ' personal attacks '			1
ahead of his major speech , mr @entity5 said he was in @entity29 to ' fly the flag for @entity6 and to attract investment to @entity6 shores '			1
he met with some of the largest investors into the @entity6 including car firm @entity54 , which owns @entity55 and @entity56 , and @entity57 which is investing in renewable and energy technology in the @entity6			1
he said he asked them : ' you ’ve invested in @entity6 – we ’ve had the biggest share of inward investment in @entity65 over the last couple of years – what more can we do to get more investment , more jobs ? ' he added : ' we are a very welcoming , open economy – that ’s one of our sales pitches for @entity6 and i ’m here to make that sale			2
' global internet firms including @entity21 , @entity20 and @entity22 have faced the wrath of @entity23 , chairman of the @entity77 , but there are fears the attacks could deter other investors coming to the @entity6 the government faces a difficult balancing act between offering a low tax regime which appeals to international firms while also being seen to take action against companies which do not pay their way			1
miss @entity23 has used her role as chairman of the pac to repeatedly accuse multi-nationals of ‘ siphoning ’ profits out of the @entity6 to low - tax countries			1
she has called for a boycott of companies including @entity22 , @entity21 and @entity20 in protest at what she said was ‘ immoral ’ avoidance of @entity6 tax			1
but senior ministers have been warned by business leaders that the sustained attacks on well - known companies are deterring some from moving their headquarters to the @entity6			1
@entity16 source a @entity16 source told @entity2 : ’ there is no doubt it is having an impact			1
' we are trying to show we have one of the most competitive corporate tax regimes in the world , but the message is being sent out if you come here you will be exposed to this sort of criticism from @entity23 and her committee			2
’ some companies which have a lower public profile are nervous of being subjected to the scrutiny of their financial affairs			0
the source added : ’ the head of a company looking to move here would see the way other people have been hauled in front of @entity132 and subjected to criticism and will think : “ i ’m not doing that			2
” ‘ the likes of @entity22 and @entity21 will always be here , but other companies looking at @entity6 are being put off the idea of moving their headquarters here because they fear the level of public exposure for behaving perfectly legally			1
’ critics note that the amount of tax uncollected by @entity144 rose to £ 35billion last year ' we 're not accusing you of being illegal , we 're accusing you of being immoral			0
' november 2012 " i think one should boycott these companies			0
i do actually think that is the right thing to do			0
' november 2012 urging customers to snub @entity22 , @entity21 and @entity20 ‘ companies like @entity21 should pay their fair share of tax based on their economic activity in this country and the profits they make here			1
its behaviour is not only unfair , it is anti-competitive , putting @entity6 businesses that do pay their proper tax at a disadvantage			2
’ may 2013 ‘ i think you do do evil			0
that is , you use smoke and mirrors to avoid paying tax			0
’ may 2013 , referring to @entity20 's slogan ' do n't be evil ' ‘ why have you not litigated against one single internet company ? make a few cases , a few show cases			0
it ’s so bloody obvious			0
’ october 2013 , urging @entity144 to take the likes of @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity176 to court there is particular concern about the effect of the @entity25 ’s attacks in the @entity182 , where it is viewed as being as influential as powerful congressional committees which hold sway over major decisions on tax and spending			2
@entity188 , @entity39 chief policy director , said : ' it is right to have high levels of scrutiny into the activities of businesses , and companies recognise the increasing level of public interest in many areas of their operations			0
' any questioning into business activity should be robust , fair and professional , and should not turn into personal attacks			0
' the unease was hinted at by treasury minister @entity205 in a speech last year when he said it was ‘ quite understandable ’ that companies would be put off moving to the @entity6 if they are ‘ worried that their reputations will be unfairly damaged ’ and if ‘ perfectly legal and perfectly legitimate behaviour might be presented to the public as something different ’			1
mr @entity205 said : ‘ tough action on tax avoidance , yes			0
but we must also recognise that if the debate is driven by myths and misunderstandings , we could risk jobs and investment in the @entity6			2
’ however , miss @entity23 insisted that she would be ‘ completely robust ’ in challenging any suggestion her committee ’s work was damaging investment			1
companies looking to relocate look at a range of factors , including the skills base of the workforce , the potential and whether employees would see it as a good place to live and work			0
‘ there is a range of issues and tax is just one , ’ she added			0
‘ to be absolutely honest i think if we do n’t get this right , if we do n’t get the tax from one set of people we have got to find it from others and you end up damaging @entity6 companies with @entity6 workers			1
‘ i think it ’s a completely fallacious argument that i am happy to have with them because i think they are wrong			1
’ @entity5 at the @entity29 summit last year took a swipe at @entity22 , saying companies had to ' wake up and smell the coffee ' and pay the right tax , but this week he will present a more upbeat message to investors while ms @entity23 ’s committee has launched a sustained campaign against large companies ’ tax arrangements , ministers have also joined the chorus of disapproval			1
a year ago at the @entity29 summit mr @entity5 appeared to single out @entity22 when he said ’ companies need to wake up and smell the coffee ’ and realise that customers wanted them to pay their way			1
the prime minister is expected to strike a very different tone when he returns to the gathering of global business and political leaders , instead emphasising efforts to attract investment into the @entity6			0
chancellor @entity280 has repeatedly cut corporation tax - which is paid on the profits companies make - in order to persuade more foreign firms to set up the hq in the @entity6			2
‘ the best way to help businesses is by lowering the burden of tax ’ , he said last month as he published data showing reducing the corporation tax rate actually increased the amount of money raised for @entity16 coffers			0
when the coalition was formed it stood at 28 per cent but in april this year it will be 21 per cent , falling eventually to 20 per cent			0
@entity298 defended the right of miss @entity23 's committee to challenge companies about their tax affairs			1
mr @entity5 's official spokesman said : ' committees and their business , that ’s for them			0
what the government is focused on of course is around the economic conditions which encourage inward investment into this country			0
how committees do their business , that ’s for them			0

@entity77 chairman @entity23 is accused of deterring investors
@entity16 says @entity132 ' comments have a greater impact in the @entity182
companies who could relocate to @entity6 fear being humiliated in @entity324
but miss @entity23 dismisses the ' completely fallacious argument '
last year @entity5 *mocked* @entity22 but is now wooing investors
