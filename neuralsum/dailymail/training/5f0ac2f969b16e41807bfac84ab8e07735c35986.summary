by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor the @entity2 today boasted of victory over @entity5 ' siren voices ' who wanted to lift people out of paying the 40p tax rate			1
chief secretary to the treasury @entity9 said he had won the battle to increase the income tax threshold to £ 10,500 ahead of next year 's election , despite @entity15 mps demanding action on the higher rate			1
writing for @entity1 , he said increase the threshold is fair but ' many conservatives do n’t like this because it ’s a @entity2 idea '			0
the amount people can earn before paying income tax is to rise to £ 10,500 from april next year , £ 500 higher than the coalition planned when it was formed four years ago			1
and in a surprise move he will ensure the tax cut is enjoyed by almost all workers , including most of those dragged into the 40p tax band			2
@entity2 chief secretary to the treasury @entity9 said the @entity15 do not like the income tax cut because it is not their idea increasing the income tax threshold was a flagship policy of the @entity2 , who pledged to increase it from £ 6,475 in 2010 to £ 10,000 by the general election in 2015			1
the policy was adopted by the coalition and became the signature tax cut , despite calls from @entity15 for a cut in the headline tax rate			2
mr @entity9 , the @entity2 chief secretary to the treasury , said he had forced the rise through in the face of opposition from @entity15 backbenchers			0
writing for @entity1 , he said : ' many conservatives wanted us to do something different			0
you only have to listen to what some @entity15 back benchers have been saying in the run up to the @entity65 urging action on the 40p rate instead			2
' those siren voices in the @entity5 also miss the point that raising the personal allowance helps nearly all taxpayers , including the majority in the 40p band			0
' while raising the personal allowance is fair and popular it seems that many conservatives do n’t like this because it ’s a @entity2 idea			0
' the new increase to £ 10,500 means basic rate taxpayers - anyone earning less than around £ 41,000 a year - will be £ 800 better off in 2015 than in 2010			1
at each budget chancellor @entity26 has announced big increases in the threshold , which means the £ 10,000 target will be hit a year early in april 2014			1
@entity2 leader @entity85 pushed for another rise in today 's budget of £ 500 , allowing workers to keep an extra £ 100 of their earnings			2
he described it as a ‘ workers bonus ’ to offset the pain of years of austerity			0
@entity26 's changes to the 40p tax rate before the @entity65 meant that 1.3million more people had been dragged into paying it deputy prime minister @entity85 has tried to take credit for a £ 500 rise in the income tax threshold , which will almost all workers are £ 100 better off next year ahead of today 's budget he sought to claim credit for the policy from the @entity15			1
' of course it 's a @entity2 policy , ' mr @entity85 said			0
' it was on the front page of our manifesto and it 's now been transformed into the pay packets of millions of @entity112 taxpayers			0
' it was n't in the conservative manifesto , it was only in the @entity115 because i insisted that it should be			0
' everybody knows i 've been going on about this for over half a decade , while the @entity5 have been going on about inheritance tax cuts for millionaires , tax cuts for the very wealthiest , tax changes to give up your employment rights for shares			0
' the changes mean that for this year the number of basic rate taxpayers is 24.3million , the lowest since 2006 - 07			2
however , mr @entity26 has faced a storm of criticism from some conservatives for freezing and lowering the higher rate of tax			2
in 2010 when the coalition was formed there were 3.02million people earning more than the £ 43,875 threshold where they started paying the higher tax rate			1
but this year the threshold has fallen to £ 41,450 , which means 4.4million now pay the 40p rate			1
in 1988 just 1.35million was paying that rate			0
increases in the threshold at which workers start paying tax mean the number of basic rate taxpayers has fallen by almost 3million since 2010 critics say the higher rate is no longer faced only by the ‘ highly paid few ’ but hitting middle earners like teachers , nurses and small businesses			1
the @entity154 insists that anyone earning less than £ 100,000 has benefited at least in part from the increase in the income tax threshold to £ 10,000 , although only basic rate payers have saved £ 700 - a - year			1
a typical higher rate taxpayer will be only £ 56 better of this year than under inherited plans			0
and mr @entity26 has ensured that the full £ 100 tax cut in 2015 will be passed to most people paying the 40p rate , up to incomes of £ 100,000 .			1

income tax threshold to rise to £ 10,500 in april 2015 , saving most £ 100
tax changes since 2010 mean basic *ratepayers* will be £ 800 better off
but @entity26 offers little *respite* for those dragged into paying 40p rate
