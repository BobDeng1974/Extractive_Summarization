@entity1 's powderpuff performance in @entity2 underlined their dire need to find a physical presence in midfield			1
a man willing to sacrifice himself for the team , to do the jobs that @entity1 's silky footballers seem unprepared to do			1
as @entity10 this week admitted : ' i ’m happy with the signings we have made but we still need a physical presence with prodigious ability like @entity16 or @entity17			1
' here @entity18 looks at some of the targets in his sights			2
@entity22 ( @entity23 in the background ) was disappointing during @entity1 's defeat at @entity2 @entity10 watched his midfield get completely over-run by @entity28 's side @entity29 former @entity31 midfielder was in discussions over a deal to join @entity34 prior to the transfer deadline closing but delays in his acrimonious release from @entity38 slowed down the process			1
@entity40 needed a guaranteed starter and pressed ahead with his bid for @entity43 instead			2
@entity29 is free and is willing to accept a role as a squad player on a short term deal			0
@entity10 knows the former @entity49 international well after signing him in 2007 from @entity50 but he grew frustrated at lack of first team opportunities then			1
at 29 , he still has enough quality to make a contribution and discipline to play the holding midfield role			0
@entity29 ( right , playing for @entity57 ) was in discussions over a deal to join @entity34 @entity59 the @entity61 international is unsettled at @entity62 and has been on @entity1 's radar for two years			1
the 23 - year - old is one of the unsung members of @entity62 's coveted squad as he has the disciplined mindset to sit in front of the back four and allows his teammates to move forward			2
has a knack of performing well against the bigger teams and was outstanding in their unfortunate defeat at @entity76 on the opening weekend of the @entity78 season			0
@entity59 is still only 23 , is big , strong , good on the ball and has @entity80 experience from his time with @entity83			1
he could prove a good investment for @entity1 's future at £ 15million			2
@entity59 is unsettled at @entity62 and has been on @entity1 's radar for two years @entity86 the @entity87 international is overpriced but has potential			1
@entity89 wanted £ 23.8million for him last month and @entity1 were reluctant to offer more than £ 18m			0
indecision in the transfer market at @entity1 has often cost them and this could prove another example			2
@entity86 is 22 years old is powerful , versatile and has the physical attributes of a @entity16 but lacks composure			1
he can be rash in the tackle but that could be put down to the over exuberance of youth			0
@entity89 need the money and are willing to negotiate with @entity1 for january			0
a deal could be reached with the promise of greater add - ons based performances			0
@entity86 is powerful in the middle of the park but the @entity89 man is overpriced @entity110 the 25 - year - old @entity112 midfielder , twin of @entity2 defensive midfielder @entity113 , is a more all - round player similar to the model @entity10 has been searching for			1
however , the payer 's injury record goes against him and @entity112 still want big money for the @entity119 international who is one year into a six - year contract			2
has good vision and passing skills to accompany great defensive workrate			0
he has strength and would fit into the @entity78 well but may be too many risks for @entity10			1
@entity119 have favoured @entity128 and the emerging @entity129 - another @entity112 player on loan at @entity131			0
@entity110 is a jack of all trades in midfield and would provide @entity10 with versatility @entity136 the 22 - year - old has been watched by @entity1 since his days at @entity138 where he was also closely followed by @entity50			1
indeed @entity1 came close to striking a deal with @entity138 two years ago before @entity140 stepped in			0
he has continued to develop and @entity140 are always open to striking a deal			0
he is opinionated which has cost him his place in the @entity49 @entity146 squad in the past but should mature with experience and the right advice			0
is aggressive , likes a tackle and can pass			0
he is 6ft 1ins tall and athletic but may lack discipline at this stage			0
@entity140 's @entity136 was watched by @entity1 while at @entity138 video disappointed @entity10 bemoans counter-attacks			1

@entity10 's side were comfortably beaten by @entity2 on *tuesday*
@entity59 and @entity136 are also *interesting* the @entity158
@entity110 and @entity86 have *inflated* transfer fees
