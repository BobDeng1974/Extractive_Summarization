for a man struggling to retain a parliamentary seat vacated by a shamed colleague , it was perhaps not the best of starts			0
within hours of liberal democrat @entity2 being chosen to fight disgraced ex-cabinet minister @entity5 ’s @entity4 constituency , a photograph emerged of him apparently asleep on the job			1
the picture , which seems to show mr @entity2 nodding off , was taken at a council meeting in 2011			1
as that photograph was gleefully circulated by opponents , the local @entity19 moved quickly to delete from their website pictures they deemed far more damaging – showing the councillor with mr @entity5 , who quit @entity25 after admitting he lied to police to escape a driving ban			1
mr @entity2 , married with a 19 - year - old daughter , faces a challenge from a @entity29 described as her party ’s ‘ answer to @entity31 ’			1
@entity34 has been likened to the controversial @entity37 @entity36 politician because of her robust views on issues such as gay marriage and immigration , which potentially put her at odds with @entity45 leadership			2
mrs @entity34 , a mother of four , rose to national prominence in 2005 when she ‘ handbagged ’ @entity47 on live tv over cuts to special schools			2
one of her sons is autistic			0
mr @entity2 said yesterday he was ‘ puzzled ’ by his rival ’s campaign tactics , condemning her opposition to gay marriage			2
he said : ‘ i ’m surprised she has n’t been co-opted by @entity58			0
’ polls suggest the by - election on february 28 will be close			1
a @entity62 poll for @entity63 put the @entity19 on 36 per cent , ahead of the @entity29 on 33 per cent , with @entity58 on 16 per cent – suggesting the @entity65 party could deprive the @entity29 of victory – and @entity67 on 13 per cent			2
however , a poll last week gave the @entity69 a three - point lead			0
mr @entity5 held @entity4 at the 2010 election with a 3,864 majority			0
the by - election will put the @entity74 under immense strain , with the @entity29 going all out to snatch the seat from their @entity19 partners			1
deputy prime minister @entity78 , who will visit the @entity80 constituency today , has revealed that he and @entity81 are not co-ordinating their diaries and could therefore end up campaigning in @entity4 at the same time			0
rival : conservative candidate @entity34 has been described as the @entity29 's answer to @entity31 because of her robust views on issues such as gay marriage and immigration a @entity29 victory would be a shattering blow to mr @entity78 , and the first by - election gain for a prime minister since @entity94 at the height of her @entity97 popularity			1
mr @entity78 urged people not to cast their vote based on the ‘ courtroom drama ’ involving mr @entity5 but he conceded it is an issue			0
he said : ‘ i ’ve heard lots of people say they do n’t like what ’s happening in the court , but they actually think that what he did as a local mp was the model of a @entity19 working hard for the local community			0
’ business secretary @entity113 , said he was confident of a @entity19 victory , with the by - election a good chance to highlight differences with the @entity29			1
but he risked angering his @entity74 partners by revealing that the @entity19 are in talks with @entity67 on long - term plans for pensions and industrial strategy			2
that will be seen as another indication that mr @entity113 is ready to seek a deal with @entity67 after the 2015 general election			0
@entity29 former cabinet minister @entity127 said the @entity19 had a ‘ problem with trust ’ over student tuition fees , an @entity132 referendum and the blocking of a bid to make constituency boundaries fairer			0
shamed : the by - election is being held to replaced ex-cabinet minister @entity5 who resigned from his seat in @entity4 , @entity80 , after admitting that he lied to police to escape a driving ban			1
