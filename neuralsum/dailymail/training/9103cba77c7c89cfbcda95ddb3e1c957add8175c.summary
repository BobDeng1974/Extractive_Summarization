by @entity1 reporter published : 13:11 est , 27 june 2012 updated : 10:28 est , 28 june 2012 troublesome : the investigation found that one in three @entity3 - including kids - are failing to schedule regular dental check - ups the high cost of dental work in the @entity3 has spawned a concerning crisis , with an eye - opening number of @entity3 skipping the dentist because they can not afford it			1
a new probe has found that one in three @entity3 are failing to schedule regular dental check - ups because they do n’t have enough money - and the results could be deadly			1
the findings have come from a joint investigation by @entity18 and @entity19 of dental care in the @entity3 the report , dollars and dentists aired last night , focusing on the ordeal of @entity26 girl @entity24 , 5 , who is on @entity28 , a programme that only 10 per cent of dentists in the state participate			1
@entity32 has gone to the emergency room to receive the dental work that her grandmother can not afford			2
dr @entity37 , a professor at the @entity39 's @entity38 , told @entity18 that @entity32 ’s case is a common one in the @entity26			1
he said : ‘ 1,200 children a year in @entity26 get their dental care under general anaesthesia in a hospital			1
’ only 25 per cent of @entity28 - eligible children get any kind of dental care			1
the findings come months after it was revealed that more @entity3 unable to afford dental work have turned to the emergency room - a choice that often costs 10 times more than preventive care and offers far fewer treatment options than a dentist 's office			1
most of those emergency visits involve trouble such as toothaches that could have been avoided with regular check - ups but went untreated , in many cases because of a shortage of dentists , particularly those willing to treat @entity28 patients , the analysis said			1
in @entity26 , for example , there were more than 115,000 er dental visits in 2010 , resulting in more than $ 88million in charges			1
that included more than 40,000 @entity28 patients , a 40 per cent increase from 2008			1
many @entity75 dental visits involve the same patients seeking additional care			2
in @entity93 , nearly 20 per cent of all dental - related @entity75 visits are return trips , the analysis said			1
that 's because emergency rooms generally are not staffed by dentists			2
cost : preventive dental care such as routine teeth cleaning can cost $ 50 to $ 100 , versus $ 1,000 for emergency room treatment that may include painkillers and antibiotics they can offer pain relief and medicine for infected gums but not much more for dental patients			2
and many patients are unable to find or afford follow - up treatment , so they end up back in the emergency room			0
' emergency rooms are really the canary in the coal mine			0
if people are showing up in the @entity75 for dental care , then we 've got big holes in the delivery of care , ' @entity114 , director of @entity78 's children 's dental campaign , told @entity123			2
she added : ' it 's just like pouring money down a hole			0
it 's the wrong service , in the wrong setting , at the wrong time			0
' a recent @entity123 report find that in 2009 : @entity131 @entity75 visits for dental - related problems increased nearly 60 per cent from four years earlier			1
@entity134 hospitals had more than 55,000 dental - related @entity75 visits - five times as many as for burns			2
the center in @entity139 , is a division of the nonprofit @entity141			0
@entity78 researchers analyzed hospital information from 24 states , data from the federal @entity146 and studies on dental care			0
not all states collect data on @entity75 visits for dental care , but those that do reveal the trend , @entity114 said			2
preventive dental care such as routine teeth cleaning can cost $ 50 to $ 100 , versus $ 1,000 for emergency room treatment that may include painkillers for aching cavities and antibiotics from resulting infections , according to dr @entity37			1
these infections can be dangerous , especially in young children , who may develop fevers and dehydration from preventable dental conditions			0
dr @entity37 added that the recession has contributed to the trend			0
when a family member loses a job , dental care may take a back seat to food and other necessities			0
startling : in @entity26 , 1,200 children a year in @entity26 get their dental care under general anaesthesia in a hospital the crisis could have devastating effects , including death			1
last year , @entity180 , a 24 - year - old @entity181 , @entity182 , father , died because he could not afford to have a wisdom tooth removed			0
@entity185 reported that @entity180 was in so much pain that he needed to be hospitalised , but did n’t have the money for antibiotics he was prescribed			0
he died after the infection caused his brain to swell			0
watch video here watch @entity32 ca n’t go to the dentist on @entity18			0
