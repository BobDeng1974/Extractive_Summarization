prosecutors in a murder case against @entity3 wo n't be allowed to tell a jury about two other killings with which the @entity6 is charged or the final text messages the victim sent to his sister , a judge ruled on friday			1
@entity3 has pleaded not guilty to murder in the june 2013 killing of @entity12 , a semi-professional football player who was dating the sister of @entity3 's fiancee			1
he has also pleaded not guilty to the fatal shootings of two men in 2012 after an encounter at a @entity19 nightclub			1
prosecutors have said @entity3 may have showed @entity12 the spot where the double shooting allegedly took place , and suggested that was a possible motive for killing @entity12			1
but judge e. @entity33 , after hearing arguments , said the prosecution 's theory is ' clearly in the realm of speculation ' and ' does not comport with common sense			0
' she said there was no demonstrated link between the two crimes and disallowed the introduction of the 2012 homicides			0
@entity33 also said on friday she would not admit the final text messages sent by @entity12 to his sister , including one sent just minutes before he was shot to death at an industrial park near @entity3 's @entity60 home			1
prosecutors say @entity12 sent the messages while in a car with @entity3 and suggested they showed he had become fearful			1
one said ' u saw who i 'm with ' and another indicated the person was ' @entity27 , ' referring to @entity3 , adding ' just so u know			0
' @entity43 suggested @entity3 stopped somewhere on the way to the spot @entity12 was killed , saying investigators found dirt in his car 's tires that did n't match soil from the crime scene			2
the car , which had been in ' pristine shape ' when @entity12 was picked up , was later found to be scratched and the side mirror missing , he said			2
defense lawyers called it ' rank speculation ' that the texts indicated fear and said they were inadmissible			0
@entity33 said the texts did not suggest any hostility and that prosecutors did n't meet the burden to prove @entity12 felt he was at an ' imminent death			2
' spared : judge @entity33 says prosecutors in the murder case against @entity3 may not tell jurors about two other killings with which the he is charged jury selection is scheduled to start jan. 9			2
@entity28 coach @entity95 and team owner @entity96 have been listed by prosecutors as possible witnesses			0

@entity101 has filed a civil suit against @entity3 that says the ex-player shot him in the face in 2013 after an argument in @entity106			0
@entity108 prosecutors sought to admit a range of evidence related to the ex-player 's other alleged crimes or ' bad acts , ' including the @entity19 homicides , firearms found at @entity3 's home or elsewhere and even a photograph obtained from the celebrity gossip website @entity119 that depicts @entity3 holding a gun			1
his attorneys warned against compromising his right to a fair trial			0
' it is critical that this trial be about the murder of @entity12 , ' ; defense attorney @entity126 said friday			0
the judge allowed in some evidence relating to firearms , but disallowed the photograph			0
