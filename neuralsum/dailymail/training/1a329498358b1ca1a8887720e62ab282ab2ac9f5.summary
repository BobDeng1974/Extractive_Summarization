@entity7 is filming his fourth 007 movie spectre in @entity9 , including a scene in which @entity3 attends a funeral			1
but the @entity12 , a religious order which historically provided burial for the poor and destitute , and which still has sway over the cemetery , has refused entry to cast and crew			2
@entity7 ( pictured filming his fourth 007 movie @entity20 in @entity21 ) had been due to shoot a funeral scene in in @entity9 the graveyard , built on the site of a @entity26 necropolis , has been a place of burial for some twenty centuries			1
the order of brothers are thought to have blocked the arrival of the elaborate film set so as to ‘ respect the sanctity ’ of the tombs , according to @entity5 - based newspaper @entity35			2
