the @entity9 and @entity10 dropped its accreditation on friday after being targeted by @entity13 groups on social media who made claims the $ 1,000 fee it paid to become halal certified could be used to fund terrorism , the @entity8 reports			1
the @entity20 company were halal - certified for two years before the aggressive social media campaign last week urging a boycott on @entity24 products throughout the country			1
the @entity9 and @entity10 lost a $ 50,000 deal with @entity4 airline emirates after scrapping its halal certification on friday due to backlash from anti-halal groups sales and marketing manager @entity29 said they pulled the pin due to negative publicity , but hoped the ditched deal would n't effect redundancies or lost hours for employees			1
' the publicity we were getting was quite negative and something we probably did n't need and we decided we would pull the pin and stop supplying @entity41 , ' mr @entity29 said			1
' when our small customer base in @entity20 are reading this and starting to question us we thought , yeah maybe the negatives outweigh the positive			0
' facebook pages like @entity46 in @entity20 suggested the halal certification was a religious tax , that it was cruel to slaughter animals and that the $ 1,000 fee could be used to fund @entity53 extremists abroad			2
halal certified foods have been specially prepared or slaughtered in accordance with @entity53 law			2
' we thought this was a great coup for the company , it would bring great publicity , great advertising and we decided to go ahead with it , ' mr @entity29 said			0
' it 's been quite successful for the company , but unfortunately over the last few days , a lot of negative publicity has come in about this @entity24 certification and where this money , where we are paying fees is being spent			2
' the @entity20 company started supplying @entity41 with its halal - certified yoghurt two years ago the company took to @entity77 to announce the news last friday , but has since deactivated its account the eight - year - old company hopes to save the deal with @entity41 , but maintains the prospect remains unlikely			1
' milk as a dairy product does not have to be halal certified by law , and neither does yoghurt , which we were supplying , unless it contains gelatine , ' he said			2
' now our yoghurt does n't contain gelatine so we can definitely argue the fact that it does n't need to be certified for @entity41 [ but ] they play it safe			0
anything that goes on their planes needs to be certified , so if they 're asked , they can automatically answer ' yes '			0
' what we are going to try and do is get our products tested , get some certificates that prove that our products do n't contain gelatine and try to continue to supply @entity41 , if they 'll give us permission without the certification , but i mean that is unlikely			0
' the eight - year - old yoghurt company hopes to save the deal with @entity41 , but maintains the prospect remains unlikely because of its strict halal certification policies @entity20 pie company @entity114 's has also been the target of anti-halal campaigns , but said it refuses to bend to social media pressure , @entity113 reports			1
' from a purely economic viewpoint , halal certification brings a lot of money into @entity20 , ' a @entity120 spokesman said			0
' when you look at these sites you get the impression that a lot of the comments are written in the same voice and probably come from the same source			0
' he said he hoped @entity133 was n't ' being influenced unnecessarily ' .			0
