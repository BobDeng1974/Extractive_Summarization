@entity1 and wife @entity194 with new baby , trendy he returned to @entity7 in june on a two - year deal and it was there that he met @entity73 , who was playing for @entity199			1
‘ we were opponents , defender and attacker , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ then early in the game he says to me he used to come to my house when i was a kid and i was thinking , “ what ’s this wind - up ? ” ‘ during the game , he carried on talking about the house where i grew up , then started name - checking my brothers and sisters ! i asked my mum and dad about it afterwards and it turned out the @entity216 did come to our house back then			0
