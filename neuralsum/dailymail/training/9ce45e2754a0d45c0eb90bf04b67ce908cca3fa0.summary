time for a beer : the @entity1 allows outdoor drinkers to use the sun to tell the time clever drinkers have come up with an ingenious way of telling the time while boozing - by turning a beer glass into a sundial			1
friends @entity9 and @entity10 spent six months perfecting the glass , which when positioned correctly casts a shadow over the time of day			1
the pair came up with the idea after @entity10 asked @entity9 , a professional sundial maker , to design a beer glass sundial to use at a beer festival he organises			0
six months later they launched the @entity1 - and they have since sold more than 400			1
the clever device works by positioning it so the sun shines through a ring on the back of the glass onto vertical markings showing the months of the year			1
the height of the shadow then tells the user what time of day it is - and it is accurate to within a few minutes			0
like all sundials , the @entity1 uses local solar time , a method of measuring time using the height of the sun , rather than @entity37 , which clocks go by			2
because of that it does n't take into account @entity40			0
the @entity1 has been calculated to work anywhere in the world which is at a latitude of 51 degrees north , including @entity45 in @entity46 , @entity47 in @entity48 and @entity49			2
@entity50 : sunlight goes through the ring onto the correct month ... and then reveals the time by reading across the glass the @entity1 costs Â £ 15 and can be ordered online			1
@entity9 , 65 , from @entity55 , @entity56 , said : ' the idea for the @entity1 came about because @entity10 runs a beer festival in @entity55 and asked me if it was possible to make a sundial from a beer glass			2
' there is a type of sundial called a chalice glass which casts a shadow from the rim of a tumbler , and they have been around for 2,000 years			0
' but no - one has ever made one from a beer glass before			0
' thinker and drinker : @entity74 with the sundial glass he developed with his friend @entity9 she added : ' it took about two months just to plan and design the sundial and then it was another four months before the first glass was manufactured			2
' i 'm very proud of it - there 's nothing else like it on the market			0
' there 's something rather lovely about only having to look to your beer glass to see if you 've got time to squeeze another one in			1
' the earliest sundials date back to 3500 bc.			0

@entity1 has markings on the side that show the drinker what time it is
it took six months to perfect and works anywhere on a certain latitude
designer says glass tells you ' if you 've got time to squeeze another one in '
