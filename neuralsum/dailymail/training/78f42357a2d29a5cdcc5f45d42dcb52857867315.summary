' @entity8 was probably one of the most eccentric yet instantly recognisable characters on @entity94 television after an onscreen career that spanned more than half a century			2
however , despite his public profile , he kept a secret heartache through his life that shaped many of his views , that at times seemed abrasive			2
aged just 16 , he joined the @entity141 as a @entity142 at the start of the @entity144 after lying about his age			0
