despite a miserable year on the pitch @entity1 have rocketed into second place on a list of the world 's richest football teams with a revenue of £ 423.8million			1
so what will they spend the money on ? firstly , it is worth noting that @entity1 may not fare as well on next year 's @entity11 thanks to missing out on @entity13 football			1
@entity1 brought in more revenue for 2013 - 14 than any other club in the @entity16 @entity18 's side have moved up to second on the list despite not being in the @entity13 the club itself forecasts a drop from £ 423.8m to between £ 385m and £ 395m			1
but with the first instalment from their world - record £ 750m kit deal with adidas due in the summer and their trailblazing commercial operation showing no signs of slowing , experts say they could overtake @entity30 within two years			1
one could be forgiven for imagining that a chunk of the cash could go on wiping out the debt that still remains from the @entity37 family 's controversial 2005 takeover			1
at the last count that stood at £ 362.2m , which was actually a rise of £ 1.2m on the same period in the previous year			1
a major plan for @entity1 is to return to the glory days of the @entity13 , like their win in 2008 - 09 @entity30 were top of the tree in world football for revenue in the 2013 - 14 season , with £ 459.5million 1			1
@entity30 - £ 459.5m 2			1
@entity1 - £ 433.2m 3			1
@entity47 - £ 407.7m 4			2
@entity48 - £ 405.2m 5			2
@entity49 - £ 396.5m 6			2
@entity50 - £ 346.5m 7			2
@entity51 - £ 324.4m 8			2
@entity52 - £ 300.5m 9			2
@entity53 - £ 255.8m 10			2
@entity54 - £ 233.6m 11			2
@entity55 - £ 218.7m 12			2
@entity56 - £ 208.8m 13			2
@entity57 - £ 180.5m 14			0
@entity58 - £ 178.9m 15			0
@entity59 - £ 142.1m 16			0
@entity61 - £ 137.1m 18			0
@entity62 - £ 135.4m 19			0
@entity63 - £ 129.7m 20			0
@entity65 - £ 105.3m 22			0
@entity66 - £ 101.9m 23			0
@entity67 - £ 100m 24			0
@entity68 - £ 97.7m 25			1
@entity69 - £ 97.3 26			1
@entity70 - £ 96.6 27			0
@entity71 - £ 95.7m 28			0
@entity72 - £ 92.2m 29			0
@entity73 - £ 90.5m 30			0
@entity74 - £ 90.1m that indicates that the @entity77 - based bean counters are not looking to pay it off any time soon			0
and while @entity79 understands that @entity1 's ownership are at ease with the situation the fact that money spent on servicing the debt is tax deductable is notable			1
as for new players , not too much attention should be paid to a relatively quiet ( so far ) january transfer window			0
manager @entity18 recently said that the lack of activity was due to the traditional problem that very few players who could improve an elite side are available at the turn of the year			1
in a call to investors when the club 's latest financial figures were released in november , @entity96 struck a similar chord			0
@entity68 midfielder @entity102 is high on @entity1 's list of summer targets @entity105 ( left ) has caught @entity1 's attention with his progress while @entity108 remains a target however , the executive vice-chairman did point to the summer and say the club were already monitoring targets			1
with a number of players set to depart it would not be a surprise if the @entity119 boss was handed a similar amount to last summer , when £ 156m was spent on the likes of @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124			0
@entity68 midfielder @entity102 , @entity69 full back @entity105 and @entity55 defender @entity108 are all thought to be on the radar			1
@entity1 broke the @entity127 transfer record to sign @entity122 from @entity30 during the summer an audacious swoop for @entity48 star @entity129 has also been reported , but he is unlikely to leave an unliklely £ 200m swoop for @entity129 has also been reported but the @entity131 is unlikely to leave @entity48 - although a new striker could be on the cards should @entity123 continue to frustrate			1
further down the line , qualifying for next season 's @entity13 is essential with a new tv deal due later this year			1
@entity1 will also benefit from the auctioning of the next @entity16 broadcast rights			1
@entity140 officials are also known to be keen on turning the club 's remarkable social media following into cash			1
if revenues continue to grow as expected , there is a chance that @entity1 will look at making @entity140 bigger @entity147 ( second left , pictured at @entity148 ) is hoping to oversee a period of huge success for @entity1 according to @entity1 , they attract 380,000 tweets a day and 12m social media posts each month and the club are known to be keen on stepping up its mobile operation			1
with regards to matchday revenues , a long - term aim has been to extend the existing @entity160 which is dwarfed by the other three structures			0
this would be a complex , costly operation given the train line that runs behind it			0
however , if revenues continue to grow as expected do not rule out @entity168 's largest domestic football stadium getting even bigger .			0

@entity1 could overtake @entity30 in the next two years
@entity1 had a revenue of £ 423.8million last season , second behind @entity30
@entity68 midfielder @entity102 is on @entity18 's transfer radar
@entity69 's @entity105 and @entity108 are also @entity1 targets
qualifying for next season 's @entity13 remains a priority
a chunk of the cash could go on wiping out the debt that still remains
