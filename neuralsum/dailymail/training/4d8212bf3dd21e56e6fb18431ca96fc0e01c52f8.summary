@entity1 likes $ 550 wristwatches so much that he has bought 14 of them to give away as presents , he told a @entity6 audience on wednesday			1
the former president will receive $ 944,000 in pension and benefits from taxpayers this year and spent $ 7,700 on the watches , not counting the two he owns himself			1
in the run - up to the 2016 elections he and his wife , former secretary of state @entity12 , are trying desperately to distance themselves from charges that they 've become wealthy elites			1
asked about a rumor about his spending splurge during an april 26 visit to the @entity21 watch factory in @entity39 , @entity1 chuckled as he explained how he bought five watches last year to give as @entity41 presents , and another nine this year			1
the stunned q&a moderator turned to the audience and said he had n't known the story was true			0
' i had no idea , ' he deadpanned			0
' i thought i was just pulling his leg			0
' the @entity48 reported that @entity1 said the group he was traveling with in @entity39 bought as many as 30 of the timepieces			1
he already owned two of the @entity21 ' @entity53 ' watches – the leather bands are different colors – and a factory employee gave him a third in april , with the @entity57 engraved on the back			2
when he visited the @entity39 watch - assembly facility , according to @entity60 , @entity1 called the watch ' elegant and informal , ' adding that the @entity29 model 's large numbers help him with his flagging eyesight			1
@entity21 is @entity65 's most prolific producer of watches , which are more often made in @entity67 and @entity68			2
it also produces bicycles , leather goods , journals , leather goods and pet toys			0
its name comes from a @entity77 expression that name - checked the @entity21 brand of show polish			2
a common put - down in the @entity65 at the time was , ' you do n't know s * * t from @entity21			1
' the company acquired the trademark in 2011			0
' not out of touch ' : @entity1 's spending sprees are n't helping his wife @entity12 reposition herself as a woman of the people in advance of an expected run for president in 2016 yes , that @entity21 : the watch company 's namesake used to be a shoe polish that inspired the insult ' you do n't know s * * t from @entity21 ' despite a taxpayer - funded lifestlye , a reported $ 500,000 standard speaking fee and a growing collection of expensive timepieces , former president @entity1 insisted on tuesday during an @entity106 interview that he and his wife are normal people			1
' i think i had the lowest net worth of any @entity65 president in the 20th century when i took office , ' he claimed			1
twenty - two years later , the @entity113 are the wealthiest living former first couple			0
' we ’ve got a good life , and i ’m grateful for it			0
but we go to our local grocery store on the weekend			0
we talk to people in our town			0
we know what ’s going on			0
' @entity12 said wednesday during an interview with @entity123 that comparing her wealth to that of @entity126 , the super-rich @entity127 presidential candidate in 2012 , would be ' a false equivalency			1
' she earns a reported $ 225,000 per speaking engagement , including a planned autumn appearance at the @entity131 , a school that has nearly tripled tuition costs in the past decade			2
one student there told @entity135 that mrs. @entity12 's anticipated payday is ' obscene ... maybe they should book someone else who wo n't add to the reasons we 're paying more for school			2

former president visited the one - of - a - kind @entity65 watch factory in @entity39 that built his own watch and bought 14 of them at $ 550 each to give as presents
@entity12 has come under fire for trying to *downplay* her *massive* wealth in advance of the 2016 presidential election *season*
@entity1 has come to her aid , insisting that they 're ' not out of touch '
federal *government* records show that taxpayers will cough up $ 944,000 this year for his pension , office expenses , *health* care and other costs
