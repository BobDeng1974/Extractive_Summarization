pupils face a ban on mobile phones in school as part of a new @entity6 crackdown on classroom discipline			2
schools will be penalised for failing to tackle persistent low - level disruption in lessons under a tough new inspection regime being introduced next term			1
this could force teachers to forbid mobile phone use by pupils – including texting , taking calls and surfing the web – to avoid being marked down by inspectors			1
ringing the changes : pupils face a ban on using mobile phones in school under a tough new crackdown by @entity6 on discipline ( picture posed by models ) it will also cover other forms of disruption , including back - chatting and calling out , which damage education for well - behaved classmates			1
sir @entity34 , the chief inspector of schools , said that apart from the distracting effect of a mobile going off in a lesson , handsets can be used for cyber-bullying and accessing online pornography at school			1
in an interview with the mail , sir @entity34 told how , as a headmaster , he banned his pupils from bringing phones to school			1
recalling his experience as head of @entity52 in @entity53 , east @entity54 , he said : ‘ it certainly cut out all that nonsense that you have in schools of these things being brought in and then a mobile phone going off in a lesson			0
‘ the outrageous behaviour that you occasionally see in all schools is serious , but i think the bigger issue is that low - level disruption which takes place which stops children learning effectively			2
teachers and head teachers have got to stamp that out			2
’ tackling disruption : new @entity6 chief sir @entity34 , pictured at @entity52 in east @entity54 , where , as head , he banned mobile phones			1
he believes such measures should be rolled out across the country sir @entity34 added that bullying via phones and the internet could be ‘ disruptive and pernicious ’ and he treated the menace as seriously as a fight in the playground			1
he will use a keynote speech today to pledge to push ahead with an overhaul of the school inspection regime despite a revolt by head teachers and claims of ‘ bully boy tactics ’			1
under his reforms , 6,000 schools currently deemed ‘ satisfactory ’ will be rebadged in the next academic year as ‘ requiring improvement ’			0
‘ i know this is a tough message but i think in a few years ’ time it will be seen as a right one , ’ he said			2
‘ i ’m not a bully and never have been			0
we are raising the game			0
we are saying that all children deserve a good education and nothing less			0
’ @entity6 ’s sharper focus on standards of behaviour is expected to lead to schools taking a tougher line on mobiles			0
new laws brought in last month give teachers powers to search pupils for handsets if they are banned under school rules			1
staff may also search pupils for phones if they suspect they are being used to view pornography			0
few schools currently impose an outright ban on bringing handsets to school			1
many allow them as long as they are kept switched off and stowed away			0
but teachers warn that once mobiles are in school , they face a battle to make sure they are switched off all day			2
teachers who contributed to an online forum said : ‘ officially , we do not allow phones and will confiscate if seen			2
in reality , kids wander round using them as they like			0
’ another warned : ‘ i ’ve had the situation where i ’ve demanded the phone from , say , a year 10 boy ( i ’m female ) and they just shove the phone inside their boxers and say “ you want it , you get it ! ” ’ nowhere to hide : @entity144 ( above ) , headmaster of @entity143 , will tell a conference that heads who fail to sack incompetent teachers should have their pay docked sir @entity34 went on to reveal that heads will be expected to deal more effectively with teachers who can not control their classes			1
they will be marked down if they fail to manage the performance of struggling teachers , for example by waving through unjustified pay rises			1
‘ if the culture of the school is good and somebody is consistently under - performing because they are not teaching effectively , leading to that low - level disruption , that ’s got to be picked up , ’ said sir @entity34			1
‘ where head teachers find that teachers are consistently underperforming , where there is that low - level disruption in every lesson , no matter what the professional development taking place in the school , then action needs to be taken			2
’ sir @entity34 plans to extend @entity6 ’s reach to the new chains springing up to run academies , which operate outside local authority influence but are state - funded			1
at a conference today at @entity143 , he will say he has not been deterred from pressing ahead with toughening up the system , and that a consultation on the proposals attracted wide support , including from parents			0
@entity144 , headmaster of @entity143 , will tell the conference that heads who fail to sack incompetent teachers should have their pay docked			2
‘ no head teacher should ever tolerate bad teaching			0
yet up and down the land , that is precisely what is going on			0
‘ too many head teachers are prepared to take their relatively generous salaries yet duck the issue of the bad teacher in the staff room			0
’ a @entity201 spokesman said : ‘ parents should take responsibility for whether or not their children have phones in the first place			0
it is up to individual head teachers to decide if and when mobile phones should be used by pupils in school			0

sir @entity34 says handsets can be used to access porn in lessons
teachers could be marked down by inspectors if they do *n't* enforce ban
tough new inspection regime will also cover back - chatting and calling out
