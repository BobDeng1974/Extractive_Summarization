by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 17:36 est , 12 december 2013 updated : 16:08 est , 13 december 2013 @entity3 has announced that they plan to add one or two black female cast members to @entity5 in the new year in response to the criticism over a lack of diversity on the sketch comedy show			1
a representative for the network confirmed the news after backstage photos of ' secret ' auditions for a select group of black comediennes leaked on social media earlier thursday			1
in recent weeks , the show has seen two dozen candidates in @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23			2
making history : eleven black women were invited to audition for a spot on @entity5 earlier this month in @entity21 amid concerns that the show lacks diversity the @entity30 reported that a special audition for seven or eight finalists will be held monday on the ' snl ' stage in @entity34			1
it 's ' 100 per cent good for the show to have an african - american woman ' in its ranks , executive producer @entity35 has said in earlier interviews			1
man behind the curtain : @entity35 said that hiring a black actress has been on the show 's to do list the two current black cast members - @entity47 and @entity48 - were the ones to spurn the criticism this fall as they felt it was inappropriate that all impersonations of prominent black women meant that they would have to dress in drag			1
as a result , there have been no sketches on the weekly program featuring first lady @entity59 since @entity60 left the cast in 2007			0
the only exception to this came in november when @entity65 star @entity64 was the guest host amid the diversity furor and she played mrs @entity59 , @entity67 and @entity68 in the same sketch as the show 's way of poking fun at themselves			1
' snl ' has had just four black women in its regular troupe since premiering in 1975 , including @entity75 who is biracial			1
' it 's not like it 's not a priority for us , ' @entity35 said in an interview with the @entity81 in early november			0
i 'm sure it will happen			0
' news of the invitation - only auditions that have been taking place in @entity21 and @entity22 broke when pictures of the prospective candidates backstage hit the internet			0
actress @entity91 said she was ' honored ' to be one of the 11 black comediennes asked to audition on about two days notice in that instance			1
four black women : in its nearly 40 years on the air , @entity5 has hired just four black women			1
the first was @entity98 , right , and @entity99 , left , spent the 1985 - 86 season on the show no more : after @entity103 , left , left the cast in 1995 , there would n't be another black woman until @entity60 in 2000			1
@entity75 left in 2007 and there has n't been a black woman on the show since ' it was an awesome opportunity even though it was such short notice but , if you stay ready you ai n't got ta get ready and we were ready ! , ' she told @entity113			2
' i can share that we all entered the @entity116 theater backstage having no idea what to expect			0
i had no clue who was apart of the showcase			0
of course my comedienne friends ( @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 ) were there			0
and some talented ladies in sketch comedy were there that i had never met , ' she said			0
@entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 also auditioned according to @entity137			0
laughing at themselves : when @entity64 @entity140 hosted the show last month , the first skit made fun of the lack of black female cast members on the show by having @entity140 play @entity59 and @entity67 in the same skit done : cast member @entity47 announced this season that he will no longer dress in drag to play black women			1
he had played the likes of @entity153 ( right ) , @entity154 and @entity155 in the past ' we were all very supportive of each other and there was no sense of competition or pettiness , ' ms @entity91 said			0
' we were just happy that some new black women in comedy were being considered and given a shot			2
we even held hands prayed after the showcase			0
the show was also sold out			0
it was packed to the max. ' @entity171 says she was invited to audition last summer , but was filming a television show and was n't able to perform			2
one of the comediennes - @entity134 - has a fan on the inside , as @entity48 has publicly lobbied for her to get one of the coveted spots			2
supporter : cast member @entity48 ( left ) has specifically named @entity181 ( right ) as someone he hopes joins the cast ' why do i think she should be on the show ? because she 's black first of all , and she 's really talented			2
she needs to be on @entity5			2
and i believe they need to follow up with it like they said they were going to do last year , ' @entity48 told @entity192			0
the timing of the announcement comes not only as a result of the criticism but also due to the upcoming departure of @entity198 , who will leave mid-way through this season to replace @entity200 as the host of @entity202 .			1

an ' inside *source* from @entity5 ' set up an audition for 11 black actresses , comediennes and sketch comics earlier this month
one of the women who auditioned could be on the show as early as this season as @entity198 is in the new year to host @entity202
