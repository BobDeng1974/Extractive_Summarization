by @entity0 published : 17:01 est , 22 october 2013 updated : 02:36 est , 23 october 2013 they came at each other out of the fog – opposing armies in a battle that would change the history of @entity7			2
this was one of the most important clashes in the @entity11 , fought between the @entity12 of @entity13 and @entity14 on a site some 12 miles north of @entity16			1
in a few hours of fighting , the @entity17 helped reshape the monarchy and decide a dynastic conflict			0
old @entity21 wants to turn part of its course , which is the scene of the @entity24 , into an industrial landfill site the site is where ' kingmaker ' @entity27 ( played by @entity29 in @entity31 's @entity30 ) was killed @entity27 ( seen here in the period drama ) was killed on the battlefield , which led to a change in monarch that was back in the 15th century			1
yesterday two sides in a new conflict were mustering forces for a fight over land on which the original battle , immortalised by @entity46 in @entity47 , is said to have taken place			2
squaring up in one corner is @entity51 golf club , which sits on the 1471 battlefield – and wants to dump thousands of tons of rubbish on it			1
a proposal agreed at its annual general meeting would see it become a landfill site to allow the re-landscaping of several greens			1
on the opposing side are the forces of heritage and preservation , determined that one of the nation ’s most historic battlefield sites must not be wiped out			0
one historian said it would be ‘ an act of wickedness ’ to bury centuries - old artefacts and the prospect of historically important finds , particularly when experts believe the site has exciting new secrets to reveal			1
dr @entity77 from @entity78 said it would ' absolutely criminal ' to destroy potential evidence about handgun use at the battle historian @entity83 said the move would ' completely destroy the archaeology of the site ' researchers had just sought permission for a dig to determine the exact location of the fighting			1
some think the @entity17 – and not the @entity93 , as is currently thought – saw the first use of handguns in a major @entity97 conflict			0
if so , and if archaeologists can uncover evidence , it would give @entity101 an even more notable place in history			1
dr @entity104 , historian and archivist at @entity78 , said : ‘ it would be absolutely criminal to destroy the evidence			0
’ now historians are banding together to save the site for future generations , ‘ rather than being annihilated to make a fast buck ’ , as one put it			1
yesterday i was shown the swathe of land on which @entity116 is said to have led his @entity13 forces against the @entity119 armies , which backed @entity120			2
back then , the clash of swords and the rallying calls of knights sounded a death knell for more than 1,500 soldiers			2
soon , if approval is granted , the drone of diggers will form the soundtrack as the historic site is turned into a quagmire of mud and rubbish			2
historian @entity135 , 65 , says he often imagines the battle unfolding in the early hours of april 14 , 1471			0
the former teacher , whose home overlooks an obelisk marking where defeated ‘ kingmaker ’ @entity27 was slain , said : ‘ it will completely destroy the archaeology of the site			0
’ he points out a row of oak , ash , hawthorn and hornbeam trees where a hedge was purportedly used as cover by the @entity152			0
historians say it would be ' an act of wickedness ' to bury centuries - old artefacts at the scene of @entity27 , 16th @entity27 's death ( pictured ) we cross an expanse of green upon which fighting is likely to have taken place			1
it is now the seventh tee , thought to be one of those earmarked for landfill			0
the 125 - acre site is owned by the @entity170 of @entity101 and leased to the golf club , which is seeking permission to develop part of its 6,500 - yard course			1
the club has not made specific proposals public yet			0
manager @entity178 added : ‘ we have to ensure we have the best design and playing surface around			0
