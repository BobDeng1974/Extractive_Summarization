by @entity0 most women prefer swimsuits to be as miniscule as possible – providing optimal opportunity to tan – but a new trend seemingly tries to achieve the opposite result			0
long - sleeve swimsuits , in which modesty takes precedence over a golden glow , have emerged as summer ’s newest beach silhouette			1
while some boast sun - protecting benefits , not all are as resolute in their functionality			1
the stylish wetsuit - like one - pieces are popping up everywhere from @entity16 and @entity17 to @entity18 ; and for beach - goers who want to show off slightly more skin , cropped , long - sleeve rash guards are proving to be the new ‘ bikini ’ of the season			1
while some promote their styles as a stylish antidote to the sun , with fabric that helps block a full - spectrum of uv rays , others have adapted to the trend with a full focus on fashion			1
many of the more tasteful , functional interpretations come from the trend 's pioneer - a @entity28 - based sun protectant clothing label named @entity34			2
the brand , which first introduced its long - sleeve one - pieces in 2012 , is now hawking the styles at @entity18 , as well as a luxury shopping site operated by @entity60			1
it is the brainchild of @entity62 , who was inspired to create the label in 2007 after her little sister developed melanoma at the age of 23			0
in an attempt to find her sister a chic suit that offered sun protection , ms @entity62 quickly realized how few options there were			1
she set out make sun protection a personal pursuit by educating women how being smart about the sun does not mean skimping on style			2
after the success of her rash guards and bikini bottoms grew , ms @entity62 decided to launch a long - sleeve all - in - one style in five years later – a roll - out that doubled her company ’s volume			1
striped sensation : @entity89 's $ 176 one - piece claims that it has as much sun protection as an @entity91 50 the designs are produced of a tightly - woven spandex that she says physically blocks sunrays from burning the skin underneath			2
they have consistently sold out each season – forcing her to reorder multiple production rounds from her manufacturers			0
while many of ms @entity62 's designs are offered in solids , with a contrast - colored waistband , she has also collaborated with contemporary artist @entity106 and photographer @entity107 on a few styles that have been screenprinted with vivid pieces of their work			2
in promotional shots the suits offer a somewhat nostalgic appearance , that on models , provides a refined silhouette reminiscent of @entity118 's gamine conservatism			2
but according to ms @entity62 , the suits ’ full - coverage sensibility is intended for women of all ages and body types , even extending beyond those with whittled waists			2
she told @entity125 : ‘ it ’s actually very flattering … one of the nice things about it for larger size women is you can actually wear your best fitting bikini top underneath and keep it covered up – it provides the support you want and when you have larger arms you can feel more comfortable with this coverage			0
’ with fit fears abated , ms @entity62 ’s designs still draw misconceptions about their ability to regulate one ’s body temperature			0
conventional wisdom would lead one to believe that sitting in the sun wearing full sleeves would provide a sweating experience akin to an outdoor sauna			0
funner fare : @entity146 's $ 143 one - piece , and @entity148 's cut - out style ( now on sale for $ 19.99 at @entity16 ) are reminiscent of designs popular beside the mainstage at this year 's @entity153 festival but ms @entity62 contests that her suit ’s microfiber fabric adjusts according to the surrounding climate			1
‘ if you are in a cooler beach climate like northern @entity159 you remain dry and they protect you from the wind			0
if you are in a hot climate and it ’s slightly damp it keeps you cool , ’ she said			0
similar suits by @entity167 label @entity89 , whose all - in - one styles are horizontally striped like a @entity171 bodysuit , claim to offer protection that equivocates to an @entity91 50			0
but for all of these designs ' built - in functionalities , there are countless more long - sleeve styles that simply appear to be bikini recreations of outfits seen at this year ’s @entity153			1
many retailers are describing their long - sleeve bikini designs as cropped rash guard sets , in reference to the surfboard - burn protecting shirts : lending an edge of athleticism to what is otherwise a pairing of a spandex crop top and underwear			1
a cropped rash guard being sold at @entity192 for $ 29 is formatted as a cropped baseball tee with a pineapple decal covering each breast			0
a $ 175 blue paisley style by @entity197 may have arms that extend down to the wrists , but its midsection abruptly ends just under the bust line			0
while they may be appropriate , depending on your taste , for a @entity205 set poolside in @entity206 or at one of @entity209 ’s many beachfront raves , these suits ’ classification as ‘ rash guards ’ are at odds with their actual performance - let alone their ability to block out the sun. fashion , not function : many new swim tops , including @entity197 's $ 175 creation ( left ) and @entity222 's $ 29 design ( right ) , are touting themselves as ' cropped rash guards , ' and in doing so abandon the true principle of rash guards to begin with flower power : @entity17 's $ 33 bikini top could easily be worn with a mini skirt for a night out dr @entity229 , a @entity230 - based dermatologist who often makes appearances on @entity233 ’s weekly best - dressed lists , explained to @entity125 : ‘ people wear rash guards on a surfboard because there can be a lot of friction between the board and your skin – you can actually get superficial burns with the paddling if you are out there for hours			1
’ an avid surfer herself who often ventures to @entity251 for its massive waves , dr @entity229 says that consumers seeking sun - protection need to be cognizant of the sun ’s strength in their surrounding environment			0
‘ i have actually gotten sunburnt through fabric – i still wear a full layer of sunblock underneath the wetsuit , ’ she says of her surfing procedures			0
‘ the sun can be so strong , if you want to wear [ these suits ] because you are hanging out on the beach and want to look cool , that ’s one thing , but if you are surging and out there for hours you can get burned			1
