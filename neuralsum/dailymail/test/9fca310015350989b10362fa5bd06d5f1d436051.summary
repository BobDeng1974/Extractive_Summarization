two teenage cancer survivors have been left distraught after photographs they posted on @entity2 to celebrate getting the all - clear were reported for nudity			1
@entity5 and @entity6 , both 19 and from @entity7 , @entity8 , became close friends during their treatment and went into remission around the same time			1
they then took to social media to post images of themselves - including one of miss @entity5 ’s bald head and another of miss @entity6 ’s chest scar - but these were reported for being ‘ offensive ’			1
reported for nudity : @entity5 and @entity6 , took to social media to post images of themselves – including one of miss @entity5 ’s bald head ( left ) and another of miss @entity6 ’s chest scar ( right ) battled through : @entity5 , pictured with @entity21 , was cleared of @entity23 lymphoma this month shock : the picture @entity5 uploaded ( left ) was reported by someone on @entity2 for ' nudity ' miss @entity5 was cleared of @entity23 lymphoma earlier this month and regularly documented her struggle with losing hair during chemotherapy on @entity2			1
while undergoing treatment she decided to cut off all her hair after choosing against it on many previous occasions - making a ‘ ten - minute decision ’ that she would get a friend to shave it off			1
but , telling of what happened next , she said : ‘ feeling proud , i updated my friends on @entity2 with the caption “ i did it ! ” - and about two hours later found that someone had reported it for nudity			1
‘ it did n’t get deleted but i knew it must have been someone i had as a friend			0
i posted a nice one of me with my make - up on the day after , and that got reported too			1
tough : this picture , the first selfie @entity49 uploaded showing her bald head , was reported for nudity survivors : miss @entity5 is seen in a photo - not reported to @entity2 - revealing she had got the all - clear ( left ) , and @entity49 's post with the image of her scar which was reported for nudity is also pictured ( right ) feeling happy : miss @entity6 , who received lifesaving bone marrow treatment from her ten - year - old sister @entity60 , said it was ' a massive deal ' for her chemotherapy catheter be taken out after her gruelling cancer battle joking around : miss @entity5 regularly wrote on her struggle with losing hair to chemotherapy on @entity2 ‘ all i was doing was trying to help others that might need that little boost to show that no one is different , with or without hair or scars			1
’ if a user wishes to tell @entity2 that they believe a picture is breaching nudity guidelines , he or she can click on ‘ options ’ under the image and ‘ report photo ’			2
the user must then click on ‘ nudity ’ as the reason for a complaint , before confirming they want to report the image to @entity2			2
it is then sent to the website ’s community operations team in @entity90 , who consider every report and make a decision based on @entity2 ’s community standards			2
the user whose profile carries the photo will receive a notification to say their image has been reported – but it is only removed if @entity2 find it breaches guidelines			1
and she was further shocked last week when leukaemia sufferer @entity49 ’s photo of the scar left by the removal of her chemotherapy catheter also got reported for nudity			0
miss @entity6 , who received lifesaving bone marrow treatment from her ten - year - old sister @entity60 , said it was ‘ a massive deal ’ for it be taken out after her gruelling cancer battle			1
she added : ‘ having that taken out was a big thing for me , as it essentially kept me alive for so long			0
i shared my scar to show people my body was one step further away from cancer			0
‘ as soon as i put it up it was reported for nudity , then straight away a selfie of my bald head was also reported - the first ever picture i posed with no hair			2
it really upset me as i did n’t see what the big deal was			0
' it ’s weird that people find it acceptable to post half - naked pictures but yet people get offended by me sharing my journey with cancer			2
’ miss @entity5 added that she was distraught to know that ‘ someone that knows me and @entity140 gets a kick ’ out of reporting the photographs			2
a spokesman for @entity2 said today that it does not comment on individual cases , but referred @entity146 to its community guidelines published online for ‘ encouraging respectful behaviour ’			0
the ‘ nudity ’ section states : ‘ we remove photographs of people displaying genitals or focusing in on fully exposed buttocks			0
we also restrict some images of female breasts if they include the nipple			0
‘ but we always allow photos of women actively engaged in breastfeeding or showing breasts with post-mastectomy scarring			0
we also allow photographs of paintings , sculptures and other art that depicts nude figures			0
‘ restrictions on the display of both nudity and sexual activity also apply to digitally - created content unless the content is posted for educational , humorous or satirical purposes			0
' @entity177 images of sexual intercourse are prohibited			0
