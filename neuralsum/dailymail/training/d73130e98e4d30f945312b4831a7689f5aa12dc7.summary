more racist and misogynistic emails that were allegedly sent and received by @entity2 poetry and poetics professor @entity3 have emerged since he was suspended from work on friday			1
the new emails have been leaked by online news website @entity7 in response to mr @entity3 's claims that he was quoted out of context and his defence that they had been sent during a ' whimsical linguistic game ' largely to one other recipient			1
however the emails , which include slurs against @entity19 @entity18 player and @entity21 recipient @entity20 , appear to be sent to numerous friends and colleagues of mr @entity3 over two years			1
' @entity24 , a sportsman [ footballer ] , his mother one of the " @entity28 " , ' mr @entity3 allegedly wrote of mr @entity20			1
' ticking all the correct boxes			0
now all we need to know is that he suffers from ' depression ' and has a disability , and he becomes the complete role model for @entity34 today			0
' ' @entity46 wants this so he can combine it with the inclusion of @entity50 in the @entity51 later this year … to show that he really is a sensitive guy after all			0
' new @entity52 said they released the string of edited transcripts in response to mr @entity3 's previous claims that the emails quoted him out of context			1
he told @entity60 last week that the exchange was a pastime ' that mocked extreme language ' , saying the comments were ' largely to one recipient with whom i have had a whimsical linguistic game for many years of trying to outdo one another in extreme statements '			1
the email continues : ' @entity46 wants this [ for @entity20 to be titled @entity21 ] so he can combine it with the inclusion of @entity50 in the @entity51 later this year … to show that he really is a sensitive guy after all ' however , @entity7 says the emails , which were allegedly sent between late 2012 and 2014 , had been sent between mr @entity3 and numerous colleagues and friends			1
in another email referring to a woman who was sexually assaulted by a colleague who ' put his penis in her mouth ' while she slept , mr @entity3 allegedly responded with ' @entity83 gods			1
i think she needs a lot put in her mouth , permanently , and then stitched up '			2
two separate emails , one sent in @entity88 and the other in january 2014 , include the following comments from mr @entity3 's on various video links : ' no fatties , darkies or chinky - poos ' and ' no @entity50 , chinky - poos , @entity96 , graffiti , piercings , jeans , tattoos			2
@entity101 in all @entity103 chruches ; @entity104 in all @entity106 ones			0
not a woman to be seen in a sanctuary anywhere			0
and no obese fatsoes ' another email allegedly shows mr @entity3 calling a house in which an @entity112 family live ' a rubbish tip : human and material '			2
new @entity52 disputed claims by mr @entity3 that the emails were a ' whimsical linguistic game ' between himself and one recipient by releasing almost 20 of the emails that were sent between late 2012 and 2014 to numerous colleagues and friends he wrote : ' ... it is now utterly destroyed , with its contents and smashed up fabric vomited out onto [ a street ] , the pile impregnated with empty booze bottles , awaiting the @entity132 special garbage collection for trashed housing			1
' these are the people whose ' ancient wisdom ' , our @entity137 says , we should respect , and to whom we apologise on every possible occasion and whose rich culture we bow down before , confessing our wickedness in our mistreatment of them			0
' another email , it is alleged professor @entity3 called the chancellor of @entity2 as an ' appalling minx '			2
. professor @entity3 was employed at @entity2 as @entity149 in @entity150 and poetics but was suspended by the university on friday the allegations against professor @entity3 , who took charge of examining nationwide @entity156 courses , came just days after results of the @entity158 were released			1
despite claims from the @entity161 that the review is ' tainted ' , education minister @entity159 has refused to review the new curriculum for bias , according to the @entity165			1
however , a spokesperson for mr @entity159 told @entity60 : ' the minister utterly rejects and finds repugnant the denigration of any minority on the basis of their sex , race , sexual orientation or beliefs '			0
as part of his role in reviewing the national curriculum , professor @entity3 made the recommendation to reduce study into the @entity112 and @entity182 language			2
@entity2 students rallied outside the city campus on friday calling for the sacking of professor @entity3 for the racist , sexist and derogatory comments in the email exchange in one of the emails released by @entity7 on sunday , sent on april 19 2014 , mr @entity3 is alleged to complain about being sent 300 pages to read by mr @entity159 for the completion of the review			1
' and whereas the local curriculuim has the phrase ' @entity112 and @entity182 ' on virtually every one of its 300 pages , the @entity194 curriculum does not once mention native americans and has only a very slight representation of @entity200 ( which , unlike @entity202 literature , actually exists and has some distinguished productions ) , ' mr @entity3 apparently wrote			2
' [ a fellow @entity2 academic ] tells me that at her grand - daughter 's school – [ in @entity208 ] - every day begins with an acknowledgement of the orignal [ sic ] owners of the land			0
no flag - raising or national anthem - just this , every day			0
on the school 's website , it proclaims that it prides itself on its ' atheletics ' [ sic ] program			0
' if ever an education system needed a bomb under it , it 's ours			0
' they also attached a note to the @entity149 's office door which dubbed him the ' professor of bigotry ' mr @entity3 told the @entity7 his recommendations in the review were made with his ' considered professional view and not in any way influenced by these email exchanges which are linguistic play '			2
professor @entity3 said he was shocked that anyone would take the language used in the emails seriously as he always treated his students - no matter what background they are from - equally			0
the @entity2 suspended professor @entity3 's employment on friday after initial reports that offensive emails , including one which referred to prime minister @entity46 as an ' abo lover ' , had been sent from his university account			1
@entity159 had responded to the claims and said he was disgusted by the alleged slurs but will not review the new curriculum for bias ' professor @entity3 is suspended , effective immediately , from teaching and engaging in any other @entity2 business and is precluded from attending any @entity2 campus , while the matter is investigated and dealt with in accordance with the terms of the @entity2 ’s @entity256 , ' the university said in a statement			1
' racist , sexist or offensive language is not tolerated at the @entity2			0
