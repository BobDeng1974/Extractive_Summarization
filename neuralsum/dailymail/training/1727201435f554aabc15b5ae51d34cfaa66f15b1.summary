@entity0 may be six months pregnant but there will be no slackening in pace as she sashays up the red carpet at the @entity5 tomorrow			1
make - up can hide any exhaustion after all			0
for the young @entity10 star , nominated as @entity11 for her role in @entity13 , the war - time movie about the @entity15 codebreaker @entity14 , it will be the last leg of a marathon of pre-award parties , post-award parties , talk show appearances and discussion events to promote the film			1
it is a schedule that has prompted concern from a midwife and left her looking tired			0
like countless other @entity5 contenders , @entity0 has learnt that there is no such thing as a night off when you are campaigning for a @entity30 film			1
@entity32 ’s most famous and most influential producer was not nicknamed @entity33 for nothing			1
this is the @entity32 power broker the stars offend at their peril			2
@entity30 is a regular fixture on @entity5 night , occasionally seen clutching a statuette or grinning magnanimously as a winner announces it could not have happened without him			2
he has been thanked 24 times in @entity5 speeches , more times than anyone , including @entity53 ( @entity54 actually called him ‘ @entity53 ’ when she won a @entity55 )			2
@entity30 and his brother @entity56 have had more than 300 @entity5 nominations for their films			1
@entity30 is credited ( particularly by himself ) with spotting the movies that other studios would not touch – @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 – and making them into critically acclaimed box office hits			2
he has championed the film careers of @entity69 , @entity54 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity0 , not to mention the violence - obsessed director @entity73			1
now he has his eyes on @entity75 , prince @entity77 ’s ex who , he says , is a ‘ fantastic ’ actress ( he produced her debut film @entity78 , released later this year )			2
in the flesh , of which there is a lot , the man known in @entity32 simply as ‘ @entity30 ’ does not quite match the mannered period charm of his @entity10 films or the rarefied thespians he puts in them			1
icons : @entity30 has championed the film careers of @entity69 , pictured together , @entity54 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity0 a bear of a man , he has a temper to match			1
although friends insist he has calmed down with age and the humbling experience of seeing his career nosedive after an ignominious split from @entity98 empire a decade ago , @entity30 still clearly terrifies most people in his industry			2
he has been accused of trying to throttle one film executive and it is claimed he once put a reporter in a headlock			1
this is not quite the behaviour one might expect of an honorary @entity107 but the @entity108 was indeed awarded that honour for services to @entity10 film			0
the 62 - year - old son of a diamond cutter from suburban @entity114 is admired , feared and loathed in equal measure in @entity32 but , as well as his reputation as the industry ’s biggest bully , he is revered as a man with an unmatched skill in nurturing small independent films			1
while the main studios rely on relentless comic book adventures and sequels and dull rom - coms , he is one of the few people who can raise money to make interesting movies			0
during the current awards season , @entity30 has been in his element			2
winning is worth more than just a gold statuette – the @entity64 ( with @entity133 as @entity134 ) was originally expected to earn about $ 15 million but made $ 400 million after its triumph at the @entity5 in 2011			0
what ’s more , it seems that no @entity5 campaign stunt is too cynical for @entity30			2
this year , he was up to his old tricks , highlighting the @entity13 ’s gay rights relevance ; codebreaker @entity14 ( played by @entity141 ) was imprisoned over his homosexuality			1
the film had been lambasted by critics for being anti-gay in wrongly suggesting @entity14 became a traitor in order to keep his sexuality secret but in a bravura pr gesture , @entity30 offered to return his cbe if it could be given posthumously to @entity14 and then called on the @entity150 to support gay rights and vote for his film			1
@entity30 has spent millions promoting movies in the weeks before the @entity5			2
in 1999 , he was said to have spent more on pushing @entity61 than most studios spend actually making a movie			0
such huge spending makes a mockery of the idea that films are judged on their merits			0
@entity30 uses every trick to get attention : star - laden screenings , cold - calling the @entity150 ’s 6,000 - plus voters ( a variety of professionals within the industry ) and holding lavish parties , such as the one hosted by @entity168 and @entity169 after @entity64 was nominated			1
last year , @entity30 concentrated his efforts on his film @entity174 ( the story about a young @entity177 girl who became pregnant out of wedlock and was sent to a convent )			1
one of @entity30 ’s biggest coups was getting the @entity181 to agree to meet the woman who inspired the film , together with @entity184 , its co-writer and star			1
@entity32 heavyweights : @entity30 ( right ) and his brother @entity56 ( left ) have had more than 300 @entity5 nominations for their films			1
@entity30 has been thanked 24 times in @entity5 speeches , more times than anyone @entity30 ’s schemes can get him in trouble			2
when @entity195 ’s @entity196 was unexpectedly beaten for @entity197 in 1999 by @entity30 ’s @entity61 , a furious @entity195 said that @entity30 had planted press stories challenging the historical accuracy of @entity196			0
in 2001 , he was accused of starting a whispering campaign against another @entity5 rival , @entity202 ( the biopic about a maths genius called @entity205 who won a @entity207 )			0
@entity30 , it was widely claimed , spread a rumour that @entity205 was antisemitic			0
@entity30 is said to have been furious when his plotting was exposed and blamed a female studio executive , yelling : ‘ you ’re going to go down for this ! ’ @entity30 denies the claims			1
even after this embarrassment , however , he seems not to have reformed his ways			0
when the acclaimed director @entity217 made a film about the painter @entity219 for @entity30 ’s company , @entity220 , @entity30 was unimpressed			1
they watched it at a cinema test screening and he lost his temper with @entity217 and some of her team			0
winner : in 1999 , @entity30 was said to have spent more on pushing @entity61 than most studios spend making a movie			0
above , @entity30 ( third from left ) with the film 's producers and @entity69 moving menacingly close to @entity217 ’s boyfriend , @entity231 , @entity30 is said to have yelled at him : ‘ why do n’t you defend her so i can beat the s * * t out of you ! ’ @entity30 denied the threats , saying he was ‘ rude and impolite ’			1
@entity30 says he gets upset only because he is so passionate about films			2
brutality in the film industry simply means honesty , he claims			0
film executive @entity241 said @entity30 tried to strangle him in a restaurant after @entity241 sold the film shine , about the troubled pianist @entity244 , to another studio			1
passionate : brutality in the film industry simply means honesty , @entity30 , pictured , claims ‘ he was totally out of control and had to be thrown out of the restaurant , ’ said @entity241			1
‘ it was very unpleasant to have this guy strangle you in a restaurant but i give him credit for being passionate enough about @entity256 to hunt me down and confront me			0
it is also claimed that @entity30 dragged a newspaper reporter out of a party in a headlock boasting he was the ‘ * * * * ing sheriff ’			0
again , he disputes the story			0
an unabashed @entity263 , @entity30 is married to @entity264 , the @entity10 fashion designer and co-founder of the expensive label marchesa			0
his friends include @entity268 and @entity269 while @entity270 , the paedophile financier with links to prince @entity272 , is said to be an ‘ acquaintance ’			0
@entity5 - winning director @entity274 once described him as a victim of ‘ arrested adolescence ... a bully who feels that if he screams and yells and punishes you enough , he is going get his way ’			0
@entity30 ’s brutal reputation became the talk of @entity32 in 2008 when he tried to speed up the release of his film , @entity285 , in time for the awards season			1
it was claimed he had badgered one of the film ’s producers , @entity288 , on his deathbed , and hassled the widow of @entity293 , the other producer , who had recently died			0
@entity30 insisted the story was untrue until an email emerged which proved it was			0
@entity30 ’s reputation as a savage slasher of films in the cutting room if he regards them as too long or too slow , has earned him the nickname @entity30			2
@entity302 , the @entity5 - winning @entity303 cartoon director , was so incensed by @entity30 ’s tinkering with one of his films that he sent him a samurai sword with the ominous message : ‘ no cuts ! ’			1
to his stars , though , @entity30 is charming and avuncular			0
‘ he looks out for me , ’ said @entity69			0
when @entity314 ’s wife went into labour during filming , @entity30 arranged for a plane to fly her back to @entity10 and paid the cast and crew for four days while they waited for @entity314 to get back on set			0
no wonder actors fall over themselves to praise @entity30 from the @entity5 podium ; it is better to be pampered by @entity33 than risk being on his wrong side .			1

62 - year - old is admired , feared and loathed in equal measure in @entity32
