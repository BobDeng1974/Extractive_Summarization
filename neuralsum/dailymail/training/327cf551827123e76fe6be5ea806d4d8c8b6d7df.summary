after a life - long love of @entity3 , 29 - year - old @entity1 man @entity0 spent two years building a @entity4 in his backyard			1
the superhero enthusiast made a 6.2 metre @entity4 modelled in accurate detail on the one used by @entity3 in the 1989 movie - the only one in the world with full street registration			1
with a passion for the winged comic character , in 2009 mr @entity0 bought a few spare parts from the actual @entity4 used in the movie and put them away			1
' i 'm a car and bike guy so i love all that sort of stuff , ' he said			2
' it does n't get much better , if you can build anything what would you build ? for me it was a @entity4 , ' he told @entity26			2
it took @entity0 several years to complete the car mr @entity0 let the parts sit around while he built a @entity39 and it was not until 2010 that he got in touch @entity42 to see if there were any licensing issues for building a @entity4			1
getting the all clear , mr @entity0 started working on the @entity4 with his grandfather @entity45 , a retired mechanical engineer and @entity46			1
' i could see at that point why nobody else had done it before , ' he said			0
mr @entity0 , who lives with his grandparents and has no formal mechanical training built the @entity4 at home and at mr @entity46 's workshop			1
' about 30 per cent is made from the parts used in the film and the rest was moulded and made , ' he said			0
' it started with my grandfather who said " any fantasy can become a reality " , so we took that to the next level			2
' mr @entity0 first built a bat chopper ( motorbike ) before he enlisted the help of his grandfather , a former mechanic , to help him build the @entity4 , a much more challenging project mr @entity0 dresses up like @entity3 and uses his car and bike to support charities like @entity71 the vehicle was finished at the end of 2011 and sat in mr @entity0 's garage for one - year until he decided what he wanted to do with at the end of 2012			1
at this point mr @entity0 wanted to get @entity4 registered , but with movie cars not designed for safety , he said it took about a full year to get it passed as roadworthy			1
as part of this process , mr @entity0 took the car to @entity85 to work on it with an engineer for nearly three months to make changes needed to get the car registered			1
the @entity4 was finally registered in december 2013 and mr @entity0 said it was a moment of validation			1
' before it had plates people thought it was just a plastic prop , ' he said			0
the car does not feature machine guns , grappling hooks , or oil slick dispensers like @entity3 's , but it does have a working front turbine and afterburner			2
the car does not have some of the features of the movie @entity4 , such as machine guns , grappling hooks , and oil slick dispensers , but it does have a working front turbine and afterburner mr @entity0 bought a few spare parts from the actual @entity4 used in the movie in 2009 and stored them away in the hope of one day expanding his fleet of @entity3 inspired vehicles ' i 've always been a movie fan			1
@entity3 has the coolest vehicle and he 's the only one without super powers , ' he said			0
mr @entity0 lives in @entity112 in south west @entity1 and has seen his life change since finishing and getting the vehicle registered in december last year			1
' there are between 10 and 12 in the world and this is the only one in @entity118 , besides a prop at @entity120 , ' he said			0
' as far as i know , it 's the only one in the world with full street registration , ' he said			1
' some have conditions to parades and that sort of thing			0
' when the @entity129 came to the house to inspect it and they were impressed with the quality			0
' work in progress : mr @entity0 built the car with his grandfather over several years			1
it has now been approved for use by the @entity138 mr @entity0 used some original parts from the @entity4 used in the 1989 film and some that he and his grandfather built themselves to make the car ' they were a bit concerned at first but then they were happy when they realised it was all legitimate , ' he said			1
but because of the crowds the car attracts , mr @entity0 ca n't use it for personal use			1
' i 've taken it to do the groceries one or two times - the reaction was crazy , ' he said			0
' i have to go get fuel separately otherwise it gets mad with people looking at it and takes me three hours to fill it up			0
' on a recent trip to @entity162 in @entity1 's @entity163 , mr @entity0 said he required a police escort			1
' i could n't get out of there it was that crazy , ' he said			0
mr @entity0 said the vehicle 's high value presented some unique obstacles			2
' it 's so high - risk and the insurance is high ' , he said			0
' it 's too risky to drive around on the roads in case it gets hit , ' he said			0
but he added the vehicle had also attracted some unexpected propositions			0
' i 've been offered close to a million dollars for it from a few people , a businessman in @entity1 made and offer and someone on behalf of a sheik in @entity185 made an offer as soon as it was registered			0
' ' i would say that they were fair offers but i had had zero enjoyment with it at that time so i was not considering selling it and it now provides me an income			0
' an offer in the high hundreds of thousands is what i would say that it is worth with street registration on it			2
' mr @entity0 worked on the car with his grandfather @entity45 , who is a retired mechanical engineer and @entity46 the car has attracted offers of close to a million dollars from a businessman in @entity1 and a sheik in @entity185 but in the six months since the vehicle has been registered , the @entity3 enthusiast has been busy using the car professionally and for charity work , which he now considers his full time work			1
' i do a lot of charity work - i 've done more than 40 @entity71 wishes , i 've also dropped men off at their weddings and sometimes partners organise surprise rides , ' he said			2
' it 's the opportunity to be involved with charities like @entity71 , that 's the best thing , 100 per cent			0
' some of the younger kids do n't quite get what it is , but kids above 10 get really into it , especially all the superhero stuff , they love			0
' completing the @entity3 theme , mr @entity0 wears a specially designed @entity228 , designed by @entity229 of @entity230 and based in @entity231			2
but his love of all things @entity3 is so strong , mr @entity0 has also built a @entity39 from scratch			2
' everything apart from the gearbox and motor is handmade from aluminium , ' he said			0
taking shape : the @entity4 has been used to brighten up the lives of sick kids , as mr @entity0 visits them in his @entity3 suit and @entity4 through the @entity71 about 30 per cent of the car was made using parts from the original @entity4 featured in @entity247 's 1989 @entity3 film , with the rest moulded and made by mr @entity0 and his team despite the popularity of the @entity4 , mr @entity0 plans to permanently garage it in the future			1
' i just did not expect how crazy the response would be - i 'm putting it away in a year or two , ' he said			0
' i was heading to a @entity71 event and was on the freeway from @entity257 to the @entity258 and i heard a buzzing noise - it was a news helicopter			0
' mr @entity0 is planning on building and selling @entity261 cars			1
' i 'm a decent way along in the designing			0
i 'm going to start in a few weeks hand building @entity261 - style cars people can register and drive , ' he said			0
like - minded @entity3 enthusiasts can join mr @entity0 for joyrides through a @entity271 deal to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the 1989 @entity3 film			1
@entity0 ( far left ) had a passion for @entity3 since he was a young child			2

@entity0 spent two years building a @entity4 in his garage with the help of his grandfather
he modelled it off the car used in the 1989 movie and it is the only one in the world with full street registration
