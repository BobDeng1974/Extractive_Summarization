however , the results were met with incredulity by some education experts yesterday			1
two years ago a damning @entity20 report said 450,000 children had been labelled @entity22 to cover up poor teaching			1
tuition : nearly a fifth of all pupils are considered to have problems including learning difficulties , speech and language needs or a form of autism , the data shows , with twice as many boys as girls affected ( file picture ) schools can also claim extra funds if pupils are classed as having certain types of educational needs			1
and it is taken into account when assessing exam results – thus boosting a school ’s standing in league tables			0
@entity47 , of the @entity48 , who has been a headteacher in the state and private sectors , said : ‘ it ’s become an industry that has grown over the past 20 years at a rate that is impossible to believe			0
in my view , a lot of it is to do with children not getting good teaching			0
‘ one of the criteria for classifying children as @entity22 is they ca n’t read when they get to seven or eight			2
that is often because of the way they have been taught			0
‘ it also attracts extra funding , so it is a way of boosting a school ’s budget			0
’ a local authority makes a statement of special educational needs if it decides that the child ’s needs can not be provided from within the school ’s resources			0
these resources can include money , staff time and special equipment			0
the @entity80 figures found 1.5million children at all schools were classed as @entity22 in january			1
this is actually down slightly on last year , when the figure was 1.6 million			0
separate @entity86 data published last week found pupils with a statement of special educational needs are about eight times more likely to be expelled and six times more likely to be suspended at least once			2
special needs : some parents were found to be lobbying for positive diagnoses so that their children would receive extra support , such as tuition and extra time in exams ( file picture ) pupils with @entity22 , but no statement , are 11 times more likely to be permanently excluded and five times more likely to get one or more suspensions			1
the @entity20 report unearthed a ‘ culture of excuses ’ in some schools which meant pupils making slow progress were classed as sen. ' it ’s become an industry that has grown over the past 20 years at a rate that is impossible to believe			1
in my view , a lot of it is to do with children not getting good teaching ' @entity119 some parents were also found to be lobbying for positive diagnoses so that their children would receive extra support , such as tuition and extra time in exams			2
the report said the term special educational needs ‘ is used too widely ’ with many schools using low attainment and relatively slow progress as their principal indicators			2
‘ inspectors saw schools that identified pupils as having special needs when , in fact , their needs were no different from most other pupils , ’ it said			0
all schools ’ funding includes an element to support children with sen. but if the @entity22 costs per pupil are more than £ 6,000 , the local authority helps with the additional costs			1
a @entity80 spokesman said : ‘ we are reforming the special educational needs system so that children and their parents have more say and greater control over the support they receive			0
‘ our reforms will improve outcomes for pupils with @entity22 by providing better information for families , greater integration of vital services and one system for children and young people with @entity22 from birth to 25			1
