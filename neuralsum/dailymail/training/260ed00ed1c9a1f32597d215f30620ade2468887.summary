understandably mr @entity11 is already more than entitled to some extra rest and relaxation after his service in the @entity25 from 1942 through 1945			1

you have to keep moving , ' mr @entity11 told @entity45 after being recognized for his service by @entity20 mayor @entity46 on may 9			1

' i was very , very happy , ' mr @entity11 told @entity17 of his trip that included a visit to the @entity66			1
' at my age and my strength , i ’m able to stand up and do anything			2
my mind is good , so i ’m able to do what i want , ' he said			0
mr @entity11 attributes active yard work and a single baby aspirin taken every day to his long life			1
it 's the physical work he particularly emphasizes			2
but the whiskey ’s good too , as he explains			2
' @entity77 ’s a good medicine			0
it keeps your muscles tender , ' he said of his common regiment			0
sadly , he says a major part of this @entity3 will be missing from his day , as he reflects on everyone he served with , but has now outlived			1
‘ i know i had someone from my platoon until recently , but he passed so now i do n’t have anyone that i know , ’ he said			0
‘ so i feel lonesome by myself sometimes			0
i would love to ask some of them some questions , but nobody is here			0
