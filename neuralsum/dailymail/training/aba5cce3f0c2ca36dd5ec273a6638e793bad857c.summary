' what happened was that the day i went to pay off my college student loan at the @entity11 , the girl working there put my receipt into the wrong stack , and two weeks later , a phd diploma came in the mail			1
' i did n't even graduate , i only had about three years of college credit			2
in fact , i never did even learn what the letters " phd " even stood for			2
but he had an even bigger shock in store with the confession that he once stole a safe			2
he wrote : ' as it turns out , i am the guy who stole the safe from the @entity45 back in june 1971			1
' back in the 1970s : friends of mr @entity9 learned on sunday that the man they thought held a doctorate only received the degree thanks to a paperwork mistake he also seemed to have a problem with theme parks			1
he said : ' to @entity54 - you can now throw away that " @entity56 " file you have on me , i 'm not a problem anymore - and @entity58 , too , if you read this			1
' the light - hearted obituary was published in the @entity61 following his death from throat cancer on july 10			1
mr @entity9 began writing his own death notice in the first person last year , when it became clear that his medical condition was worsening			1
his widow , @entity18 , told local station @entity68 that the confessions are true			2
the following obituary was published online for the @entity61 and on @entity71			1
below is an abridged version			2
i was born in @entity23 , march 27 1953			2
i died of throat cancer on july 10 2012 ... i had a lot of fun			1
it was an honour for me to be friends with some truly great people			1
i 've had great joy living and playing with my dog , my cats and my parrot			2
mr @entity9 's light - hearted obituary was published in the @entity61 following his death from throat cancer on july 10 but , the one special thing that made my spirit whole , is my long love and friendship with my remarkable wife , my beloved @entity18			1
i loved her more than i have words to express			2
every moment spent with my @entity18 was time spent wisely			2
over time , i became one with her , inseparable , happy , fulfilled			2
i enjoyed one good life			0
travelled to every place on @entity101 that i ever wanted to go			0
had every job that i wanted to have			0
learned all that i wanted to learn			1
fixed everything i wanted to fix			0
eaten everything i wanted to eat			0
my life motto was : ' anything for a laugh			0
' now that i have gone to my reward , i have confessions and things i should now say			0
as it turns out , i am the guy who stole the safe from the @entity45 back in june , 1971			0
i could have left that unsaid , but i wanted to get it off my chest			0
also , i really am not a phd			0
what happened was that the day i went to pay off my college student loan at the @entity11 , the girl working there put my receipt into the wrong stack , and two weeks later , a phd diploma came in the mail			1
i did n't even graduate , i only had about three years of college credit			0
in fact , i never did even learn what the letters ' phd ' even stood for			0
mr @entity9 's widow , @entity18 , told local station @entity68 that the confessions are true for all of the @entity134 i have worked with , i 'm sorry , but you have to admit my designs always worked very well , and were well engineered , and i always made you laugh at work			1
now to that really mean @entity139 ; after all , it was me that rolled those rocks into your geyser and ruined it			0
i did notice a few years later that you did get @entity145 working again			0
to @entity54 - you can now throw away that ' @entity147 ' file you have on me , i 'm not a problem anymore - and @entity58 , too , if you read this			1
to the gang : we grew up in the very best time to grow up in the history of @entity153			0
the best music , muscle cars , cheap gas , fun kegs , buying a car for ' a buck a year ' - before @entity23 got ruined by over population and @entity161 was brand new			1
@entity68 was boring back then , so we went outside and actually had lives			0
we always tried to have as much fun as possible without doing harm to anybody - we did a good job at that ... my regret is that i felt invincible when young and smoked cigarettes when i knew they were bad for me			1
now , to make it worse , i have robbed my beloved @entity18 of a decade or more of the two of us growing old together and laughing at all the thousands of simple things that we have come to enjoy and fill our lives with such happy words and moments			0
my pain is enormous , but it pales in comparison to watching my wife feel my pain as she lovingly cares for and comforts me			0
i feel such the ' thief ' now - for stealing so much from her - there is no pill i can take to erase that pain			1
if you knew me or not , dear reader , i am happy you got this far into my letter			0
i speak as a person who had a great life to look back on			0
my family is following my wishes that i not have a funeral or burial			2
if you knew me , remember me in your own way			0
if you want to live forever , then do n't stop breathing , like i did			0
