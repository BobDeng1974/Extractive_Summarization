by @entity0 for the @entity1 so near , yet so far away			2
the chance of a first classic success for @entity4 is so close he can probably smell it			1
but between this morning 's penultimate declaration stage and saturday 's £ 650,000 @entity7 lies potentially nerve - shredding tension for the 35 - year - old in his fourth season training in @entity13			1
in his @entity17 runner - up @entity15 , @entity14 appears to be holding a hand stacked with aces as he chases the fifth and by far the most important @entity22 of his blossoming career			1
@entity15 is the class act of the line - up in the season 's final classic and 5 - 2 favourite			1
brave : @entity4 says the incident reinforced his philosophy that you should live every day like it 's your last but a weather forecast threatening to dry the ground on @entity37 's @entity37 racecourse , venue of the colt 's @entity22 @entity40 success last october , could throw a spanner in the works for a horse which has missed its last two intended runs when conditions turned against him			1
it 's a scenario that causes no - go zones to be declared around tense , irritable trainers whose patience becomes rationed			1
he was a born realist and recognises no amount of hollering can turn a tide flowing in the wrong direction			2
it also helped that that he learned from one of the sport 's most level - headed and respected mentors during 10 seasons assisting the late @entity61 whose @entity63 stables he now occupies			1
but , more than almost any of us , @entity14 knows the place in the world of a horse race , even one of the most important ones in the racing calendar			1
strength : @entity4 admits the 48 hours after the incident were difficult but now says he stops being scared that was a lesson shatteringly learned when he lost elder brother @entity74 to a brutal murder at the hands of immigrant worker and paranoid schizophrenic whose long history of mental health problems raised uncomfortable questions of why he was not only walking the streets but had even been allowed into the country			1
@entity4 said : ' something changes in you when you have to deal with something like that in your life			1
you stop being scared of stuff			2
' if i ever start worrying about something i always turn my mind back to @entity74 and say ' what are you worrying about that for ? it does n't matter			2
' ' all this stuff is trivial			0
we are training animals to run as fast as they can			2
as long as i am doing my best , am honest with people and can go to bed at night with a clear conscience , it does n't really matter			0
' someone asked me recently if having kids put a new perspective on life but my perspective came from losing my brother and the way we lost him			2
contender : @entity15 is the 5 - 2 favourite for the @entity7 and @entity14 has high hopes the horse can deliver ' what happened , unfortunately you read about more in the news than you used to			1
it is a frighteningly regular occurrence that some families are torn apart through murder			0
' i can vividly remember every second of those 48 hours			0
you just could n't believe it and i still ca n't			0
' the funny thing is that as soon as it happened , he was the only one at peace			0
it is the people left behind that are left with the pain			0
you have to find a way to live with it and deal with it			0
' one of my ways was to try to achieve what @entity74 did not get a chance to achieve – to live what he did n't get a chance to live for			0
' we were very close - 18 months apart			2
i think i will write about it one day because i want the story told , for people to know what happened , how mad it was and what our family went through			2
' i am not looking for pity but i also want what @entity74 went through to be told when i feel i can do it			0
' a philosophy of living life every day as if it is your last , @entity14 acknowledges , is an easier to adopt than enact but a win for @entity15 would doubtless reignite the joyous celebrations which followed the @entity40 win with @entity15 's owner @entity155 and his family			1
lead : @entity14 insists @entity15 is improving on every run and has a great chance of @entity160 success @entity4 , whose valuable success with @entity162 at @entity163 on saturday ensured he passed his previous best season 's prizemoney tally , admits things have not yet gone to plan this season with @entity15			1
the colt , which ended its two - year - old career unbeaten in three runs , has yet to win this summer but has run with massive credit each time			2
@entity14 is talking ambitious targets before the end of the season for a colt which finished eighth in a vintage 2,000 guineas and fourth to @entity177 in the @entity178 at @entity179 in july			1
in between , the way jockey @entity180 had to burn up fuel to find a good slot from a poor draw in the @entity17 at @entity185 before his length and a quarter second to @entity188 suggests there is an excellent chance his stamina will last out the extended mile and three - quarters of the @entity160 trip			1
@entity14 , married to @entity194 with two children , @entity196 and @entity197 , added : ' he has run three great races in three of the most competitive races of the year			1
' he has n't won yet which we are disappointed about but we not disappointed with him			0
' i think he is a seriously good horse who does not need soft ground to show that			0
' forget the @entity207 , he is not a miler			0
in hindsight , he produced a very creditable run			0
his @entity178 run was also very good run			0
' if you look at the @entity17 , he got very close to @entity188 who is turning out to be a very good horse			0
' i do n't think he will have a problem staying the @entity160 trip			1
@entity180 is certain the trip it wo n't			0
' i think the @entity219 could be on the agenda providing he comes out of this weekend ok or even the @entity221			0
' recognised @entity219 trial the @entity223 at @entity224 on sunday is the back - up plan should @entity15 have to miss @entity37 but there is a determination to be at the start line			1
' the two times i have pulled him out – at the @entity230 ( before the @entity17 ) and at @entity231 ( before the @entity233 ) it was very quick - good to firm officially but there was no good in it			2
' i could n't take a risk because i think there is a lot to come from this guy			0
' that patience could be repaid on saturday			0
@entity241 betting : 5 - 2 @entity15 , 6 @entity242 , @entity243 , 8 @entity244 , 12 @entity245 , 14 @entity246 , @entity247 , 20 @entity248			1

he believes the incident stops him from being scared about racing
@entity14 insists he now lives every day of his life as if it were his last
@entity4 is in his fourth season training in @entity13
@entity15 is the 5 - 2 favourite for the @entity160 at @entity13
