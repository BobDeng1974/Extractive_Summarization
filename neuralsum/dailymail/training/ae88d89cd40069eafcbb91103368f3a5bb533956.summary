by @entity0 mps are expected to have a £ 7,600 pay rise rubber - stamped within weeks – despite fears of a public backlash			1
@entity4 is facing pressure from a powerful group of backbenchers who insist the 11 per cent rise recommended by their independent pay watchdog must be implemented			1
in july , the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) was condemned by all three main party leaders after recommending an increase from the current @entity1 ’ salary of £ 66,396 to £ 74,000 in 2015			1
@entity14 mp , left , the vice-chairman of the @entity15 , that represents @entity18 backbenchers , said @entity4 could not ignore @entity10 recommendations but as the consultation on the proposal ended yesterday , with about 200 responses from @entity1 , senior mps said it was ‘ beyond doubt ’ the prime minister would have to accept the increase			1
@entity10 was set up following the expenses scandal in 2009 , but has attracted criticism for recommending the pay rise for mps at a time when most workers are seeing their real wages fall			2
under the proposal , mps would earn almost three times the national average wage of £ 26,000			1
@entity14 mp , the vice-chairman of the @entity15 that represents @entity18 backbenchers , said @entity36 could not ignore @entity10 , the body it set up to rule on the issue , as that would mean putting pay and expenses back into the hands of @entity1 , which did so much to damage public faith in politics			2
he added : ‘ pay is a matter for @entity10			2
either it is independent and the party leaders accept its decisions , or scrap it			0
' because what is the point of us paying its £ 6.5milion a year operating budget if it is ignored ? ’ @entity10 ’s recommendation for a 11 per cent rise would cost taxpayers an extra £ 4.6million a year , but would come with more restrictions on mps claiming expenses for items such as dinner and taxis			1
another senior member of the @entity15 said that the prime minister had to accept @entity10 's recommendation - which would see salaries rise to £ 74,000 mr @entity14 said : ‘ what is required is a bit of leadership and courage			1
with the pm saying that the ipsa recommendations are n’t ideal , respecting the independence of this body must be better than returning to the failed system of the past , which nearly shattered faith in our democracy			0
’ another senior member of the @entity15 said : ‘ it is beyond doubt the prime minister has to accept @entity10 ’s recommendation			2
@entity36 gave it the power to decide			0
we can not withdraw that power because it looks bad			0
’ sources claimed yesterday that @entity86 would seek a way out of the impasse by publicly condemning the rise but conceding that the watchdog ’s word on salaries is final			0
a no 10 spokesman said they would wait for @entity10 ’s final report at the end of the year			0
he added : ‘ we will publish our final decision after examining all the responses			0
this is not subject to a vote in @entity36			0
