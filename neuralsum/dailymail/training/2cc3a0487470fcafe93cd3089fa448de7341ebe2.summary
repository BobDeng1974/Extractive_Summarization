@entity0 is writing a tell - all book about her affair with @entity3 after the scandal left her hard up , unable to get a job and with her dreams dashed , friends have claimed			1
the former @entity9 intern , 39 , is reportedly penning the book - including her intimate love letters to the ex-president and how he desired threesomes - for revenge on her former flame			1
but friends say it could simply be a matter of cash for @entity0 , who was left with massive legal debts and could never achieve her dream of ' losing 30 lbs , finding a boy , moving to @entity20 and having a family ' after revelations of her @entity24 trysts with @entity3 surfaced			1
speaking out : @entity0 is reportedly writing a $ 12 million tell - all book about her affair with @entity3 while @entity0 has yet to sign a deal , it had previously been claimed that publishers were scrambling for the book and had offered her as much as $ 12 million			1
' she may very well need the money , ' a friend told @entity33			2
' that ’s why she did the @entity35 [ biography in 1998 ]			0
she had massive legal debts			0
it was a misconception that she came from a wealthy family			0
she 's had trouble finding work			0
' she went to the @entity42 where it was easier for her blend in , because , in @entity45 , what prime minister has n’t had an affair ? but when she came back to the @entity47 , she could n’t escape her past			0
' who is going to hire her and have her name come across in an email ? it 's unfair			0
she 's a smart , capable , personable woman			0
how many 22 - year - olds have made bad judgements ? admiration : a december 1996 @entity9 photo shows @entity3 and @entity0 at a @entity58 party affair : @entity0 , pictured in november 1995 , claimed she had nine sexual encounters with president @entity3 in the @entity24 between november 1995 and march 1997 ' i think , if she had her dream , she would have lost 30 pounds , found a boy , moved to @entity20 , and had a family			1
' speaking to the @entity66 , friends said the book will include never - before - seen love letters that she wrote to the president - some of which were so intimate she never sent them			1
they reportedly detail her love for @entity3 and how @entity0 , then just 22 , could make him much happier than his wife , @entity73 , who the president called a ' cold fish '			1
the book will also reportedly detail how he laughed about his nonexistent sex life with @entity73 - and said he thought he was not the only one looking for love outside their marriage			1
' @entity0 can describe how @entity3 went on and on about his insatiable desire for three - way sex , orgies and the use of sex toys of all kinds , ' the friend added to the @entity66			1
centre of a scandal : in october 1996 , @entity3 embraces @entity0 , then a @entity9 intern aftermath : in july 1998 , @entity0 follows her lawyer @entity92 through a media swarm as well as the heartbreak she suffered after her relationship with @entity3 , @entity0 also plans to detail the pain of ending a pregnancy at the height of her liaison with the president , the source said			1
she was carrying a child fathered by a @entity104 employee called ' @entity105 ' , she revealed in an earlier biography written by @entity35			0
' that void has never been filled , ' said the friend			0
she is also writing it to get revenge on @entity3 , now 66 , friends said			1
' for years , @entity0 tried to protect @entity3 out of a misplaced sense of loyalty , ' a source told the @entity66			0
' but she no longer feels that way , and her memoir is his worst nightmare			0
' during her grand jury testimony against @entity3 in 1998 , an immunity deal prevented her from exposing intimate details about their affair in the @entity35 expose that came out that year			0
denial : with his wife standing by in january 1998 , @entity3 insists he did not have relations with ' that woman ' truth : but in august 1998 , @entity3 confessed on television that he did have sexual relations with her coming clean : people in @entity132 in august 1998 read papers the day after @entity3 admitted to the affair ' but that agreement expired in 2001 , and when @entity3 published his autobiography my life three years later , @entity0 felt betrayed by him all over again , ' said the source			0
but another source told @entity33 that , while she was exploring the option of writing a book , she was n't out for revenge			1
' that 's not like her , ' they said			0
another longtime friend added : ' someone may have pitched her the idea and she said , " why not ? " maybe she could do a self - help book on how to survive a scandal			2
' but they added it was unlikely it would be a sordid tell - all : ' she would n’t get into salacious details like that			2
that 's not her mindset			0
' editors have also cast doubt over interest in the book , questioning whether a $ 12 million deal is really on the cards			1
one top editor told @entity33 she believed that , considering @entity3 's current popularity , a book trashing him ' would be a non-starter ' that would only be suited to select , conservative publishers			2
' nightmare ' : @entity0 's friends believe the book could rock @entity3 's marriage to @entity73 , left , who he called a ' cold fish ' during the affair			1
they are also pictured with daughter @entity175 her bids for a book deal will at least shake @entity3 - bringing him crashing down from the success he enjoyed after an energetic speech at the @entity181 earlier this month			2
her apparent attempts to cash in on the affair could rattle the @entity3 marriage - and wreck @entity73 's bid for the presidency in 2016			1
it could also affect @entity3 's health ; he has undergone two heart surgeries in recent years			0
though it has been 14 years since she claimed she had nine sexual encounters with the president , her presence still looms in the life of @entity3 's post-presidency and @entity73 's political career			1
in what was an unfortunate and awkward schedule at the @entity181 in @entity200 earlier this month , @entity0 's former rabbi - who publicly condemned @entity3 during the sex scandal - gave the benediction minutes after the former president took the stage			2
@entity204 reported that the awkward pairing was likely overlooked by organizers because rabbi @entity207 is such a well - known figure in the @entity210 community			2
and in july , during a visit to @entity212 as @entity214 secretary of state , @entity73 was taunted by her husband 's affair by protesters as they chanted ' @entity0 , @entity218 ! '			2

former @entity9 intern ' will detail encounters in new $ 12 million book '
it ' will include her never - before - seen love letters to the president , his desire for threesomes and his ridiculing of @entity73 '
friends say the book would be for much - needed cash rather than revenge
doubts over how much interest - and money - book has actually *garnered*
