by @entity0 published : 19:05 est , 19 march 2012 updated : 05:34 est , 21 march 2012 exercise in transparency : chancellor @entity2 out jogging yesterday every taxpayer is to get a personal annual statement revealing how each pound taken from them by the revenue is spent			1
@entity2 will announce the radical move in tomorrow ’s budget , saying every worker has the right to know how their taxes are spent once the money enters the public purse			1
in some cases , the results are likely to prove startling			0
a higher - rate taxpayer earning £ 50,000 this year would be told they paid £ 14,183 in tax and @entity21 – of which around a third , £ 4,727.67 , is spent on welfare			1
at the same time , £ 2,469.68 is spent on health , £ 1,848.73 on education , £ 818.52 on defence and £ 705.62 on public order and safety			1
a further £ 141.12 is given to foreign aid and £ 70.56 is handed to the @entity30			2
a @entity32 source said : ‘ it ’s quite right that people know how much tax they pay and what it ’s spent on			2
’ the chancellor believes that revealing exactly how the money from @entity40 ’s 29million taxpayers is used will change for ever public attitudes to government spending			1
@entity44 ministers are also hopeful that if the public is more aware of how much they really contribute , they will be more inclined to vote for parties which favour lower taxes			2
and they believe making more taxpayers aware that the basic rate is 31p , not 20p – once national insurance is included – would help transform voters ’ relationship with the state			1
the chancellor is also considering even more radical reform , which would see income tax and @entity21 merged			1
as well as saving businesses billions in administration costs , @entity58 would not be able to use increased national insurance contributions as a politically cost - free way of raising money to spend in areas such as the @entity65			1
treasury minister @entity66 said : ‘ for a lot of people , the tax line on their pay slip is the only time they see just how much they ’re paying in tax , but the government does n’t think that ’s good enough			2
‘ we want to make tax more transparent and we want people to be more engaged with their own tax affairs			0
we plan to lift the lid on tax so that people understand how much they are paying , what their overall tax rate is and what they should be paying			1
’ conservative mp @entity88 , who has championed the idea of personal statements , said : ‘ few of us would part with more than a few pence without a record of how it was spent			0
from supermarket receipts to electricity bills , we expect an itemised breakdown of where our money goes			0
‘ yet for our largest monthly payment , to the taxman , we get just two numbers printed on a pay slip			0
we are not told the overall value of our taxation obligation			0
‘ we are not told what proportion of our income it represents			0
crucially , we are not told how the government spends the money we are made to give it			0
breakdown : a mocked - up form for a mr @entity110 and released by the @entity32 shows how the new style of personal statements which every taxpayer is set to receive could look ‘ just as we are under an obligation to pay tax , the government should be obliged to tell us how it spends our money			0
‘ it is a simple idea that could change the way we do politics			0
for the first time people will get a real feel for the relative distribution of their taxes			0
‘ tax statements could be implemented quickly and cheaply			0
they help the government merge income tax and @entity21 and do more than anything else to help it achieve transparency in the tax system			1
’ in tomorrow ’s @entity133 , the chancellor will announce that from 2014/15 , 20million taxpayers will receive an annual personal statement			2
they will be made up of the eight million who fill out a self assessment form each year along with the 12million who receive a @entity32 notice telling them of a change in their tax code			0
the scheme will then be rolled out to the remaining nine million taxpayers at a later date			0
@entity58 is likely to protest that the statements reveal nothing about the benefits they get from public spending , such as @entity65 treatment or child benefit			2
radical : @entity2 will announce the move in tomorrow 's @entity133 , saying every worker has the right to know how their taxes are spent breakdown of spending : a higher - rate taxpayer earning £ 50,000 this year will learn they paid £ 14,183 in tax and @entity21 - of which around a third , £ 4,727.67 , goes on welfare however , the @entity32 will argue making such a calculation would be so complicated that it would be impossible to produce			1
administering the new system is expected to cost around £ 800,000 a year			0
yesterday it emerged that former @entity44 chancellor @entity167 was back in 11 @entity168 a fortnight ago to celebrate his 80th birthday and advise the chancellor on tax reform			2
in his famous 1988 budget , @entity167 slashed the top rate of income tax from 60p to 40p – a move that caused such an outcry that the @entity177 sitting had to be suspended			1
the whole truth : the chancellor , pictured visiting a branch of @entity181 in @entity182 today , believes that revealing exactly how taxes are used will change public attitudes to government spending your money : mr @entity2 , pictured talking to bank workers in @entity182 , will announce that from 2014/15 , 20million taxpayers will receive an annual personal statement @entity192 troubles : the prime minister , pictured at a @entity133 meeting with treasury secretary @entity195 , is said to still be wavering over whether to indicate that top rate of tax will come down further to 40p in 2014 mr @entity2 is tomorrow expected to announce he is cutting @entity58 ’s 50p top rate to 45p from april next year , as well as raising the income tax threshold for 23million basic rate taxpayers to around £ 9,000			1
he is also expected to pledge a review of alternative wealth taxes to replace the 50p rate , which will hit the best off twice as hard			0
the @entity205 are pushing for a mansion tax on homes worth £ 2million or more , or a levy on ‘ unearned wealth ’			2
the prime minister and mr @entity2 were said last night to be wavering over whether to indicate they will bring the top rate of tax down further to 40p in 2014 , or leave it until the next budget , following a mixed reaction to leaks of the plan			1
government sources said the pair were still thrashing out final details of tomorrow ’s budget with @entity221 and treasury chief secretary @entity195 at a meeting yesterday .			1

taxpayers earning £ 50,000 will have paid £ 14,183 in tax and @entity21 , with around a third , £ 4,727.67 , going on welfare
@entity2 hopes transparency will *improve* public view of spending
