@entity0 has asked the @entity1 to intervene after a row over the t - shirt with @entity4 led to a permanent ban on it being sold in stores @entity7 chain @entity0 has launched an appeal case in a bid to overturn a ruling which stopped it from selling t - shirts with a picture of pop star @entity4 on the front			1
@entity0 , which is owned by sir @entity15 , has asked the @entity1 to intervene after a row over the t - shirt with the 26 - year - old singer led to a permanent ban on it being sold in stores			1
last year , a high court judge concluded that @entity4 's fans might be deceived into thinking she had endorsed the ' tank ' sleeveless t - shirt sold by @entity0 and ruled it must be pulled from shelves			1
however , @entity0 – which is owned by the @entity26 – has now asked the appeal judges at the @entity28 in @entity29 to review the case after believing the previous judge had erred in his approach to the law on celebrity merchandising			2
during the case last year , @entity4 's lawyers said the image used on the t - shirt was from an unauthorised photograph taken while she was filming a video in @entity40 for one of her singles in 2011			2
at the time , mr @entity43 ruled that @entity0 's sale of the top without her approval was , in the circumstances , ' passing off '			1
today , @entity0 lawyers presented the appeal judges - @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 – with a rack of the t - shirts as the two - day case got underway			1
@entity56 , appearing for @entity0 , said the starting point in the appeal case was that the court was dealing with a ' decorated t - shirt ' in a tradition of the merchandising of star images over the decades , including those of @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67			0
mr @entity68 argued that @entity4 was in reality wrongly using the law on passing off to claim that ' only a celebrity may ever market his or her own character '			0
@entity4 has various lucrative endorsement deals with retailers including @entity0 's high - street rival @entity75			2
mr @entity68 contended that the public had no expectation that clothes bearing an image were authorised by people shown in that image			0
@entity0 , which is owned by sir @entity15 ( right ) , has asked the @entity1 to intervene after a judge ruled last year that the high street fashion chain could not sell its t - shirt with @entity4 's ( left ) face on the front he challenged mr @entity43 's ruling that , although celebrities had no general right to control the reproduction of their image , @entity0 's use of @entity4 's image did amount to passing off			1
the judge had observed it was damaging to the star 's ' goodwill ' and ultimately represented a loss of control over her reputation in the ' fashion sphere '			0
@entity103 , a partner and head of intellectual property and commercial at @entity107 , commented on the case : ' unlike in some other countries , in the @entity110 celebrities have no legal right , as such , to control the use that is made of their image			0
' but if a product is marketed in such a way as to suggest , incorrectly , that they have endorsed or approved it , then this can amount to illegal passing off			0
@entity0 has now asked the appeal judges at the @entity28 in @entity29 ( pictured ) to review the case after believing the previous judge had erred in his approach to the law on celebrity merchandising ' although each case is different , if @entity0 fails to overturn the ruling , this may discourage other retailers from selling similar items in the future and may lead other celebrities to take a tougher line in policing their rights			2
' but if @entity0 is successful , celebrities and their management teams may have to think more about how they can best protect their branding in countries like the @entity110 which do not recognise image rights			0

@entity0 ordered last year to stop selling t - shirts with @entity4 on the front
judge ruled the store 's sale of top without her approval was ' passing off '
sir @entity15 's chain *hoping* to get ruling overturned at @entity1
