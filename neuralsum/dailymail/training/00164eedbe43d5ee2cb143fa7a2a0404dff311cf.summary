by @entity1 reporter published : 10:42 est , 16 march 2013 updated : 10:42 est , 16 march 2013 talented headteachers are risking ' career suicide ' by taking on jobs at the most challenging schools , a union leader warned today			1
many good leaders have already lost their jobs amid unrealistic pressure to raise standards quickly , while others fear for their futures , according to the general secretary of the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) @entity15			1
around 120 people lost their jobs in 12 months , an @entity14 survey found last year			1
' career suicide ' : @entity15 said many good leaders had already lost their jobs amid unrealistic pressure to raise standards quickly but while headteachers who take on the top jobs in under - performing schools have great motivation to turn them around , they often do not get the support they need , mr @entity15 said			1
in his speech to @entity14 's annual conference in @entity29 , he warned that headteachers are not ' commodities ' that can be thrown away , and suggested there is already a lack of people willing to lead the most challenging schools			1
speaking afterwards mr @entity15 said : ' i 'm very worried that for many people it 's becoming career suicide and that would be distressing for our schools			1
' he added : ' what i 'm seeing is a new , and very disturbing pattern that when a school goes into special measures then very often the solution , apart from turning it into an academy , is to get a new head			0
' very often the head is turning the school around , but it does n't happen in five minutes , ' he said			0
@entity53 took on the leadership of @entity55 in @entity56 18 weeks ago			0
at a recent inspection the school was found to have serious weaknesses			0
she said she believes that she can turn the school around , and has already begun making major changes			0
' that self belief that i have , and have to pass on to others is being knocked from outside , ' she said			0
' i 've got , under the new framework , four to six weeks from the first inspection to make changes			0
' i 'm really good at what i do , but what differences can i make in four to six weeks that i can evidence ? ' ' unrealistic ' : headteachers who take on jobs in under - performing schools often do not get the support they need , mr @entity15 said @entity76 , became headteacher of the @entity78 in @entity79 nine weeks ago			1
it is awaiting an @entity82 inspection that is expected to be critical			0
' it takes great , great courage to leave a job you 've been successful in and take on a school in difficulties , ' ms @entity83 said			0
she said the school has ' tremendous potential ' for going forward , and believes it will one day be rated outstanding , but added that at the moment she , and the school are under immense pressure to make rapid improvements			2
mr @entity15 told delegates : ' too many @entity14 members lost their jobs last year and many more are fearful that the same will happen to them because of the pressure for immediate results			1
' they might have been able to get their schools where they needed to be if only they had been given a realistic timetable to do so with the right support			1
' headteachers are not commodities you can throw away and we are not exactly overwhelmed with applicants to lead the most challenging schools			2
' mr @entity15 called on @entity82 to recognise the situation and to ' put a stop to those teams who go into some of our most challenging schools applying a deficit model of inspection which creates a culture of fear , high blood pressure and lost sleep as people await the dreaded phone call			1
' he referred to one ' deeply shocking ' example , in which an outstanding deputy was appointed head of a challenging secondary school			0
@entity82 arrived two months into his tenure , and despite recognising that he had made progress the school was put in special measures and is being forced to join an academy chain , mr @entity15 said			1
' the net result is that the new , inspired and inspiring head may lose his job , other aspirant deputies who know this person will now only opt for " good " schools saying " if this happens to @entity142 , it could happen to anyone "			1
' mr @entity15 added : ' undermining and demotivating a whole tranche of aspirant and serving leaders will do nothing to raise standards in our schools and colleges			1
' his comments come the day after the conference was told that one headteacher believes she is risking ' career suicide ' by working in a challenging school			0
in a question and answer session with education secretary @entity160 , she said : ' i 'm so incredibly worried			2
i need to understand your vision of leadership in these types of schools			2
it seems to be career suicide for me to stay where i am , making these improvements			0
' in response , mr @entity160 said that the @entity82 chief inspector was making changes , so that inspections look closely at the progress that pupils are making and how schools add value to their education			2
he also admitted that some inspectors needed to ' raise their game ' and said it was absolutely the case that when headteachers are making big changes that they need to have time to do so			0
@entity82 chief inspector sir @entity185 also told the conference that he was trying to raise the standard of inspection teams , and encouraging current headteachers to join to become inspectors			2
sir @entity160 urged heads to sign up as additional inspectors or for a full - time role saying : ' i ask you to think about this opportunity very seriously			2
i need outstanding practitioners in the secondary sector who can shape and improve the inspection and accountability system in our country			0
