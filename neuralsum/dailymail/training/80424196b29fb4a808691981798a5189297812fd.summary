@entity0 have been attacked after claiming their exclusive restaurants had become ' downmarket '			2
peers are said to be angry that ordinary office workers with a parliamentary pass are now allowed to join them at their taxpayer - subsidised dining areas			1
lords catering officials allowed other people into the dining hall to cut the eye - watering £ 2.3million subsidy			1
peers have criticised the @entity7 catering facilities for becoming ' downmarket ' like high street pizza chains the exclusive @entity14 was turned into a brasserie where ordinary workers can now bring up to six guests			1
but one diner was left unimpressed – firing off a complaint against the ' downgrading ' of the restaurants and ' the appalling search for mediocrity '			2
other complaints — revealed by the @entity25 under freedom of information rules — attacked the quality of food and angry staff			2
one lord said he could get better food in a ' down market establishment like @entity33 or ask '			0
another suggested the chef who had made a mushroom roll ' should be sent to @entity37 or @entity38 and probably @entity39 '			0
one peer even complained he would get a better - value breakfast for £ 36 at @entity45 's five - star @entity43			2
last night the @entity46 said the complaints ' beggared belief '			0
it comes after it emerged the @entity7 had refused to share catering services with @entity51 - because they were worried about the quality of champagne			1
a plan to merge to management of bars and restaurants in both houses of @entity59 was jettisoned after peers expressed fears of being forced to drink cheap bubbly , according to a former commons chief			1
while the @entity7 and @entity51 share it , cleaning and archive services , reaching agreement on champagne purchasing was seen as a step too far			1
the @entity7 refused to merge catering contracts with the @entity69 because they ' feared that the quality of champagne would not be as good if they chose a joint service ' governance committee chairman @entity72 expressed astonishment at the revelation about champagne from former commons clerk sir @entity77 ( right ) a group of @entity51 is examining the way the @entity80 is run , following the row over @entity83 's plan to install an @entity85 woman as clerk			1
but one of the biggest differences has emerged over their taste in fine wines			0
former clerk sir @entity77 revealed the tensions between the two houses of @entity59 when the committee took evidence			0
he insisted that ' joint services must be a good idea ' and they already exist in @entity98 and the running of the estate			0
' nevertheless , there are historical differences between the @entity93			0
' he said there had been a long running argument – lasting 20 or even 50 years – about whether the elaborately decorated @entity106 , complete with a crystal chandelier and deep red carpets , belongd to the @entity69			0
sir @entity77 added : ' the person in charge of catering came with proposals to provide a joint catering service , and it was eventually thrown out in the @entity7 because the @entity7 feared that the quality of champagne would not be as good if they chose a joint service			1
' former labour cabinet minister @entity72 , chairman of the commons governance committee , was taken aback by the claim , asking : ' did you make that up ? is that true ? ' but sir @entity77 insisted it had happened			2
' yes , it is true , he said			0
' it should not be beyond the wit of man , chair , to brigade the services together and deliver them differently			0
former @entity132 minister @entity131 , who sits on the committee , remarked : ' you can never underestimate the capacity for self - parody in this place			0
' since 2010 the @entity7 has bought in more than 17,000 bottles of champagne at a cost of £ 265,770			1
it is the univalent of five bottles each for every peer			0
a @entity7 spokesman said : ' @entity7 would not reject a merger of catering services with the @entity80 simply on the supply of champagne			1
' @entity7 catering department and subsidy is significantly smaller than that of the @entity80 , and it is not clear that any merger would produce savings in the costs of the @entity7			1
all alcohol sold in the @entity7 is sold at a profit			2

peers angry that ordinary office workers are now allowed to dine with them
lords catering officials opened up restaurants to cut £ 2.3m subsidy
but peers have fired off complaint letters over falling quality of dining
peers also rejected plan to merge dining with *mps* over @entity175 quality
commons and @entity7 already share it , cleaning and archives contracts
but *meddling* with their meals was seen as a step too far for the @entity7
