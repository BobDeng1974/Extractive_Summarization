guess what @entity0 and @entity1 want for @entity3 ? a ' @entity4 '			1
yes a @entity4 - we 've not made it up			1
it could be the secret to @entity9 's success			2
it 's a training device which has helped the @entity12 champions run rings around @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16			1
crucially , leaving them unbeaten in the @entity18			2
@entity1 , @entity0 , @entity19 gives you the ' @entity4 '			1
and we even sent @entity22 to have a go on a scaled - down version			1
@entity9 's version comprises a ball - feeding machine erected on a 14 metre square grid			1
the wannabe - @entity50 takes his place in a centre circle and the ball is fed randomly to him at a variety of heights and angles			1
@entity9 are statistically the worst passers in their @entity18 group			2
they have made the fewest passes ( 1,201 ) with the worse accuracy ( 79 per cent )			2
they are also the ‘ long - ball ’ team of the group , making the fewest percentage of short passes ( 88 per cent )			1
their 1,527 passes so far in the competition is less than half that of @entity80			2
the player must then control the ball and deliver it to one of 64 targets within the cube			2
the target is identified by the lighting up of the square surround			0
all the action is filmed and analysed instantly			0
the results are transmitted directly onto a coach 's @entity91			0
the adidas device which former pass - master and @entity95 midfielder @entity22 tested had four targets			1
he was two seconds off the record , which impressed the adidas boffins ! @entity9 have been tipped by sir @entity100 , no less , to challenge for the @entity102 crown this year and who can argue as they top @entity104 , which was dubbed the ' group of death ' when drawn in august			0
it forced you to get your head up , open out your stance and switch on			0
unlike @entity9 's ' @entity4 ' , the one at adidas had four panels , which you had to play the ball against when the light on top switched on			1
you could n't move on until you 'd struck the correct panel and you always used the same ball			0
it soon had you blowing			0
you had to be accurate , confident in your own ability and on your toes , ready to spring in any direction			0
it was a really good laugh			0
it was hard on your legs and made you think ahead			0
the best midfielders play with wing - mirrors on and this device helps develop those skills			1
i wish we 'd had stuff like this when i was still playing ... i was told i was two seconds shy of the adidas record score			0
not bad for an old pundit with dodgy knees , eh ?			0
