@entity1 striker @entity0 has been backed to fill the void left by @entity4 's departure to the @entity5			1
@entity0 has been very much in top goalscorer @entity4 's shadow since his summer move from @entity9 , starting just four @entity11 games and scoring only once - the decider in a 2 - 1 home victory over @entity14 in november			1
but @entity0 , who has been linked with a move to @entity16 in the january transfer window , will start his second game in the space of 48 hours in saturday 's @entity21 third - round tie at @entity22 and @entity1 boss @entity23 expects the 29 - year - old @entity24 to seize his chance			2
@entity0 has been been backed to be lead the line for @entity1 while @entity4 is away with the @entity27 ' @entity28 has been waiting for his chance to stake his claim , ' @entity23 said			1
' it 's been difficult but unfortunately for him @entity4 has been in good form in the first half of the season			2
' i 've tried to give him game - time but @entity4 's been scoring goals			1
' i 'm sure it 's been in @entity28 's mind that this chance has been coming up and i think you will see a real , real player in this period			0
' @entity0 arrived in @entity1 on a free transfer but with a big reputation having scored over 100 goals in @entity24 football for @entity50 and @entity9 and winning 12 caps for @entity52			1
but he has been unable to dislodge @entity4 as @entity1 's primary striker with the @entity27 having finished 2014 as the @entity11 's top scorer and started 2015 with the last - gasp equaliser in the 1 - 1 draw at @entity57 being his ninth of the campaign			1
@entity0 has played second fiddle to @entity4 this season since his move from @entity9 @entity4 has been linked with a potential Â£ 30million move to either @entity65 or @entity66 in january but @entity67 insists @entity0 will keep the shirt if he performs well while his striking rival is away on international duty			1
' i 've said it 's @entity28 's shirt to lose no matter what happens , ' @entity23 said			0
' if @entity28 's in good form when @entity4 comes back then he will keep the shirt			2
' it 's a good period for him to really stamp his authority on the team and i 've proved it already this season that i 'm consistent with players			0
' the players that have come in and put on good performances have stayed in the team and warranted the shirt			0
' @entity4 has been in fine form for @entity1 this season but is heading off to the @entity5 @entity1 have hardly time to pause for breath during a demanding festive schedule which has already taken them to @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity57 over the past fortnight as well as having a @entity92 visit from @entity93			1
so @entity67 will utilise his squad at @entity22 , who are 22nd in @entity96 and managed by former @entity1 boss @entity97 , with several fringe players set to receive an opportunity in the absence of @entity4 , the suspended @entity101 and injured winger @entity102			2
midfielder @entity103 is also away on international duty with @entity105 at the @entity106 in @entity107 and skipper @entity108 could be among those rested , but @entity23 insists @entity1 will not be taking their lowly opponents for granted			0
@entity1 manager @entity23 has backed @entity0 to be a success at the south @entity113 club ' we wo n't allow any complacency and that message will come from me through to the players , ' @entity23 said			2
' i 've played at @entity22 and it 's a tight , bobbly pitch and difficult conditions in which to play football			0
' they 'll be looking forward to playing against a @entity11 side and they 'll be up for it			0
' but i take it very seriously and we 'll have to use our experience because we 've got players in the squad who have played in these types of games			0
' we will have to make changes because we 've had so many games , but hopefully we can use that experience to get us through to the next round			0

@entity0 has been backed to fill @entity4 's boots
@entity4 is off to the @entity5 with @entity27
@entity0 scored over 100 goals during his years playing in @entity52
