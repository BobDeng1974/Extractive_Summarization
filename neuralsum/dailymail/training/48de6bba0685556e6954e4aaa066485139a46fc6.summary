by @entity0 working parents earning up to £ 150,000 each are to get childcare tax breaks worth as much as £ 1,200 a year per child			1
chancellor @entity5 will unveil a long - awaited £ 1bn scheme that will mean all but the best - off benefiting from tax relief , despite @entity9 ’s insistence last month that the scheme would be ‘ targeted ’			1
but the move will only apply to couples where both parents are working , or single parents who are employed – likely to spark a backlash from stay - at - home mothers and traditionalist @entity19 mps who argue it discriminates against women			1
well off : working parents earning up to £ 150,000 are to get childcare tax breaks worth as much as £ 1,200 a year per child officials from the @entity24 suggested there was not enough money to support all families with child care			1
the document says : ' we need to focus our resources			0
working families who are struggling with their childcare costs or families where parents wants to go to work but ca n’t afford to , are in greater need of state support for childcare than families where one parent chooses to stay home and look after their children full time			1
' @entity44 believes the cost of childcare has become the number one cost of living issue for working couples			1
childcare costs in @entity52 amount to 43 per cent of average incomes , compared with only 14.8 per cent in @entity54 , 9.1 per cent in @entity55 and 8.4 per cent in @entity56 , according to the @entity57			0
as a result , the government believes a million women who want to work are missing from the workforce , put off by high fees for nurseries or childminders			2
the scheme , to be unveiled in the @entity66 tomorrow , will ultimately benefit around 2.5million working families			1
around £ 1billion has been set aside to fund it , though details of where the money is coming from will be announced by mr @entity5 in his commons statement			0
scheme : @entity5 will announce that all but the best - off benefit from tax relief they will be offered a tax - free childcare scheme worth up to £ 1,200 per child			1
this will save a typical working family with two children under 12 up to £ 2,400 a year			2
the scheme will be phased in from 2015 and for the first year will be open to 1.3million families with children under the age of five			2
the scheme will build up over time to include children under 12 , as existing workplace childcare vouchers , currently subsidised by the taxpayer , are closed to new claimants from 2015 and phased out			2
to be eligible , families will have both parents or a single parent in work , with each earning less than £ 150,000 a year , and will not already receive support through tax credits or the new universal credit			1
@entity44 said those who work hard must be helped they will receive 20 per cent – equivalent to the basic rate of tax – of their yearly childcare costs , up to a total of £ 6,000 per child			1
for a family with two children , the new offer will be worth more than double the amount of a single claim for workplace childcare vouchers			0
it will be open to around five times as many families			0
the prime minister said : ‘ if @entity52 is going to succeed in the global race we must help those who work hard and want to get on			0
‘ too many families find paying for childcare tough and are often stopped from working the hours they ’d like			2
that is why we are introducing tax free - childcare , saving a typical family with two children up to £ 2,400 a year			1
‘ this is a boost direct to the pockets of hard - working families in what will be one of the biggest measures ever introduced to help parents with childcare costs			1
’ deputy prime minister mr @entity9 said an extra £ 200million of support will be provided within universal credit to help poorer families			2
details of the scheme will be finalised after a consultation , but it is expected that parents will be able to open an online childcare voucher account and have their payments topped up by @entity140			0
the scheme comes on top of government support already announced , including extending the free entitlement to provide 15 hours a week of free early education and childcare for all three and four - year - olds and extending 15 hours of free childcare a week to 40 per cent of two - year - olds from 2014 - 15			2
labour education spokesman @entity150 said : ‘ parents will be disappointed that they will not get any help with childcare costs for another two and a half years			2
’ the @entity154 said the new scheme was ' massively complicated , poorly targeted and too many years away to provide comfort for families struggling right now ' , as well as being ' weighted heavily in favour of those on high incomes '			0
the charity @entity161 raised concerns that - unlike the @entity165 vouchers - the new system will provide no help for couples where one partner is studying or retraining or has been made redundant and is looking for work			0
' it is important that families in these situations do n't lose out , and that support is available to those trying to get back into work , ' said chief executive @entity178			1
the disposable income of an average family is twice what it was in the late 1970s , official figures showed yesterday			0
but the report reveals that the rise is not down to significant tax cuts , as the taxman ’s share of middle - class incomes has hardly changed over the past 35 years			0
the disposable income after taxes and benefits of a middle - earning and working age household is currently £ 29,900 , according to the analysis from the @entity194			1
this is a fall from a peak of £ 31,100 in 2007 , before the recession eroded the earnings of middle @entity52			0
but back in 1977 , the era of union barons and near national bankruptcy , the average disposable income was half this level when calculated at today ’s prices – £ 15,500			0
the proportion the @entity24 takes from the average income in tax has hardly changed			1
instead the state has continued to demand virtually the same share of middle incomes – around a third			0
this means that , in real cash terms , governments have taken increasing amounts from families			0
the @entity194 report says that , at current prices , the taxman was grabbing a little over £ 8,000 a year from an average income family in 1977 , but £ 14,464 out of their income in 2007 , and £ 12,654 now .			0

working parents get tax break of up to £ 1,200 to *maximum* of 20pc of costs
plan to be revealed in the @entity66 and help 2.5m working families from 2015

@entity24 faces backlash by saying stay - at - home mothers ' do n't *deserve* it '
government claims it will cost £ 1bn but does n't say how it will be funded
