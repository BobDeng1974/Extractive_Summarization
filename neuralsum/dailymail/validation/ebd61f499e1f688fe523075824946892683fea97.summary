@entity0 is preparing to do battle with a familiar face on sunday , as an old friend attempts to derail @entity6 's @entity5 dream			1
@entity7 are the opponents at @entity9 , led by @entity10 - the man who gave @entity0 his coaching break as his number two at @entity13			1
the pair have already crossed paths on the international circuit , sharing an entertaining 3 - 3 friendly draw in 2012 , during @entity0 's early days at the helm			1
@entity0 is preparing his @entity6 side to do battle with @entity7 in @entity5 qualifying he will be up against former assistant manager @entity10 ( pictured ) who is current @entity7 boss there is a whole lot more riding on the follow - up , with @entity6 having taken nine points from a possible 12 in @entity26 , while their opponents face a fight to stay in contention with just four points from their four fixtures			1
@entity0 admits he and @entity10 have declined to swap advice about other teams on the road to @entity36 , but accepts the two men know each other 's style ' inside out '			1
' we 're similar to players , i think			2
when you 've played at a club with someone and then you 've worked briefly with them as a coach there 's obviously a relationship there			2
' but we did n't spend hours on the phone or anything up to that , so the relationship has n't changed at all			0
obviously we are less inclined to discuss the opposition because he probably thinks he does n't want to tell me things i perhaps do n't know and vice versa			0
but we both know each other inside out and how our team will play			0
' regardless of what happens it wo n't affect how close we are			0
' @entity0 even sees a parallel between the two national sides , with both he and @entity10 attempting to eke the best out of a small number of top - tier players , while building a strong group in support			1
' i think @entity10 has done a great job there and his job is quite similar to mine , ' he said			0
' you have a limited pool of players to choose from and he has got them playing in a nice style			0
' there 's no doubt @entity7 are a good team but there is a dependence there on five or six players and the team 's make - up is quite similar to mine			1
' @entity91 scores as @entity6 were beaten 1 - 0 by @entity92 in midweek @entity94 defender @entity93 ( left ) made his debut for @entity6 in the defeat the @entity6 match - winner in recent months has been striker @entity98 , who scored against @entity99 , @entity100 and the @entity101 before being shut out in the defeat by @entity103			1
he has had a change of scenery since then , leaving @entity106 for a loan spell with @entity109 side @entity108			2
part of his motivation for that unexpected move was a desire to get regular game time at centre forward , with the @entity106 having used him predominantly in a withdrawn role			0
@entity117 , a former @entity118 team - mate of @entity98 , explained : ' he just wants to go out and get regular football , and a chance to play up front			2
' he 's had a few experiences in other countries so i think at the time he knew it was the time to move on			0
he had @entity6 in the back of his mind , he wanted to improve his football for international level too			1
' he 's always going to give you 100 % commitment and effort , give you everything but it 's about getting him focused			0
' we 've seen a focused @entity98 in this campaign so far and long may it continue			0
