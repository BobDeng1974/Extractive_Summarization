by @entity0 published : 14:17 est , 1 october 2012 updated : 18:32 est , 1 october 2012 falsely accused : innocent @entity2 , was held in prison for five months an innocent man spent five months in jail falsely accused of rape following a dna blunder			1
@entity2 , 20 , was arrested after a plastic tray containing a sample of his saliva was re-used by a forensics company			1
it meant his saliva was wrongly linked to a violent attack on a woman in @entity15 – carried out when he was hundreds of miles away in @entity17			1
yesterday a report by the forensics watchdog found he was the ‘ innocent victim of avoidable contamination ’			1
the @entity22 said the lack of records meant it was impossible to work out which laboratory technician was behind the mistake – meaning they are likely to have kept their job			2
the watchdog has allowed the firm , @entity31 , to keep its licence despite fears of other miscarriages of justice			2
mr @entity2 had been arrested and a saliva sample taken after a street fight			1
but the tray holding his dna was re-used for the rape test and a positive match showed up			1
he was arrested by @entity42 , despite never having been to the city			1
the only evidence was forensic but despite his denials he was charged and remanded into custody on october 23 last year			2
he was only released on may 7 when the case was withdrawn following an investigation			2
phone records showed he was 300 miles away on the south coast when the rape took place			2
upon his release in may mr @entity2 , from @entity54 , @entity55 , said he had endured a ‘ living nightmare ’			1
he said : ‘ i am furious at the pain it put me and my family through			0
’ ‘ they kept me in a segregation wing which was full of rapists and paedophiles			0
‘ i suffered lots of verbal abuse and other inmates spitting at us and shouting “ paedos ”			0
’ mix - up : a saliva test from mr @entity2 taken in @entity17 was re-used during an investigation of an attack on a young woman in @entity15 the blunder came despite the firm detecting an earlier , similar error			1
the real rapist has still not been caught			0
regulator @entity78 said : ‘ the contamination was the result of human error by a technician who failed to follow basic procedures for the disposal of plastic trays			0
‘ the procedures themselves were not adequate , leading to no records maintained by the technicians and nothing done to mark used trays			0
these errors were compounded by the failure at @entity31 to consider the possibility of contamination despite concerns expressed by the investigating officer			0
’ ministers have been criticised over the decision to close the government - funded @entity100 and hand the work over to the private sector			0
critics claim this will lead to more miscarriages of justice in future			0
mr @entity2 ’s solicitor , @entity109 , of @entity110 , said she was ‘ dumb - struck that this could happen ’			1
she told the @entity112 yesterday : ‘ i ’m sure [ @entity31 ] is very , very sorry it ’s happened because it ’s a black stain – a terrible fundamental error			0
‘ being responsible for processing dna material that may result in convicting or acquitting a defendant , it must be of paramount importance safeguarding issues [ are taken seriously ]			2
’ @entity31 said it deeply regretted the incident .			0

@entity2 was arrested over an attack in @entity15 , despite never having been there
