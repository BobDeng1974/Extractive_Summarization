by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:04 est , 8 november 2013 updated : 05:06 est , 8 november 2013 the @entity5 is too big and too left wing and should lose some of its licence fee , the @entity3 ’s former head of tv news has warned			1
@entity8 claimed the @entity5 had wrongly kept critics of @entity10 , benefits and immigration off the airwaves and veered to the left on many issues			1
he said it would ‘ enrich the nation ’ if rival commercial broadcasters had access to some of the licence fee to take on the @entity5 ’s dominance			1
warning : @entity8 , a former head of news at the @entity5 who oversaw the @entity25 coverage , said @entity3 had become too big and the licence fee should be shared with other broadcasters there has been growing pressure on the @entity5 over the £ 145.50 , with 70 per cent of viewers saying they want it cut or abolished			1
@entity33 ministers have warned it could be cut or opened up to other broadcasters if the @entity5 can not repair the damage to its reputation caused by the @entity39 abuse scandal and huge pay - offs to senior managers			2
mr @entity8 , who was head of @entity42 and oversaw the @entity5 ’s coverage of the @entity25 , said there should be a debate about how the next licence fee settlement ‘ helps pluralism and diversity ’			1
writing in @entity49 , mr @entity8 said that while the corporation faced widespread competition in network television , its market share of 70 per cent of all news consumption on both tv and radio was something that ‘ even long - term loyalists find uncomfortable ’			1
he suggested that while the @entity5 's stance of co-ordinating its editorial content across the organisation was a good thing , it can ‘ lead to homogeneity ’ and conformity			2
mr @entity8 said : " on the @entity5 's own admission , in recent years it did not , with the virtue of hindsight , give enough space to anti-immigration views or to eu - withdrawalists ; and , though he may have exaggerated , the former director - general @entity71 spoke of a ' massive bias to the left ' in the @entity5 he joined more than 30 years ago			1
‘ i share @entity71 's view that there was more internal political diversity in recent times , but that is n't enough unless it 's evident in a wider range of editorial view on air			0
’ @entity5 - wide policies on news programmes created ' homogenity ' on the right and wrong way to cover issues like benefits and immigration , mr @entity8 warned the @entity5 lost £ 100million in a disastrous takeover of the @entity91 travel guide business , an internal report has revealed			1
in a damning analysis , the corporation ’s governing body accused its commercial arm @entity97 of getting ‘ carried away ’ with ‘ highly optimistic ’ plans to buy the struggling brand six years ago			0
it was forced to sell the business to @entity101 - based company @entity100 at a huge loss earlier this year , prompting an internal inquiry			0
the full scale of the waste is £ 20million more than was previously thought because @entity97 continued to inject funds into @entity91 despite the fact it failed to generate the expected profits			0
the @entity110 report criticised the worldwide division for being ‘ too aggressive ’ in its forecasts , saying the potential for the travel guide to succeed as an online venture was ‘ unproven ’			0
editors ’ views are ‘ influenced by like - minded peers ’ and co-ordination of policies across programmes can lead to homogeneity , he warned			0
‘ that can be intensified by regulation that sees there being “ right ” and “ wrong ” answers			0
‘ the @entity110 speaks the language of diversity but in its edicts it promotes conformity , whether it ’s about an agreed approach to the science of climate change , “ correct ” terminology in the @entity137 or the way a documentary about benefits should be constructed			0
’ mr @entity8 said this was not an argument to take a ‘ wrecking ball ’ to the corporation , but to examine how the licence fee can bring about diversity in broadcasting			1
he pointed to a past attempt by @entity149 to launch a radio service to rival the @entity5			0
‘ if that could n't work as a commercial enterprise , might it enrich the nation if similar bids were open to funding by the licence fee ? ‘ a properly resourced service independent of the @entity5 could provide bracing competition and increase choice for audiences			1
’ he called for the @entity5 to still have the ‘ dominant slice of the licence - fee pie ’ , but added : ‘ the hard question for the corporation is why in a digital age it should have the whole pie to itself forever - when doing something different might be better for the public good			1
’ this week @entity5 director general @entity169 warned the @entity5 must end its big spending culture and return to the low - pay era of @entity172			2
he said staff had to get used to the idea of spending the licence fee money ‘ as if it were our own ’ and not an endless supply of cash			2
he said @entity5 employees also had to remember their job was to provide programmes which could not be found anywhere else			0
culture : @entity169 said staff at the @entity5 had to treat the licence fee as if it were their own money it is thought stars like @entity189 and @entity190 both earn about £ 1.5million a year at the @entity5			1
but @entity169 called for a return to the culture of the 1970s and 1980s , when the @entity5 had a reputation for being tight with money and paying in ‘ small cheques ’			0
speaking at the @entity197 annual conference in @entity198 , he said : ‘ we are owned by householders who pay the licence fee in this country and we have got to remember that every time we spend money			2
‘ there was a @entity172 sketch on quite regularly in the 70s and 80s on the @entity5 , where @entity206 would say to @entity172 “ @entity208 suit ”			0
‘ and @entity172 would say to @entity206 “ it ’s a @entity5 suit - small check ”			2

@entity8 said more of the licence fee should be open to rivals
@entity5 has 70 *%* market share for news , squeezing out alternatives
corporation - wide policies create the ' right ' and ' wrong ' way to cover issues
