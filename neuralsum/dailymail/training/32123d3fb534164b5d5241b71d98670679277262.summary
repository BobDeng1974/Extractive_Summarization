@entity1 pundits @entity2 and @entity3 have been hit with tax bills of up to £ 2.5million after investing in a suspected tax avoidance scheme			1
a string of celebrities and sports stars each paid a minimum £ 100,000 to invest in a movie venture that promised to combine box office hits with tempting tax breaks			1
former @entity13 and @entity14 midfielder @entity2 , 38 , has been told to pay back £ 2.5million while @entity16 centre back @entity3 , 48 , also faces a seven - figure bill			1
@entity18 has told them the cash is due by the end of the month			0
mr @entity3 , who writes for @entity22 , said today : ' i can confirm i did invest in the film - finance scheme @entity25 , which has recently resulted in me receiving a retrospective tax bill			1
' i have always paid my taxes and dealt with this new bill swiftly			1
' @entity29 : former footballers turned @entity1 pundits @entity2 , pictured with @entity31 , and @entity3 have been told by @entity18 they a huge amount in unpaid tax , it was revealed today @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 , as well as @entity40 are among around 1,000 household names believed to have put cash in to the same scheme			1
but they are believed to face having to pay the taxman a total of £ 1billion after @entity18 decided they avoided tax			2
the @entity48 scheme had qualified for tax breaks under rules designed by the last @entity52 government to stimulate the @entity54 film industry			1
@entity55 ( 2012 ) @entity56 ( 2011 ) the @entity57 ( 2011 ) x-men : @entity58 ( 2011 ) @entity59 ( 2010 ) @entity60 ( 2010 ) avatar ( 2009 ) @entity62 ( 2003 ) hit movies such as @entity64 all benefited from their investment and tax relief			0
but @entity18 now argues such schemes were not legitimate investment opportunities but a means of avoiding tax - and have asked the stars to repay them			2
@entity70 understands neither mr @entity2 or mr @entity3 have settled with @entity18 yet but are likely to do a deal and pay back at least some of the money tax collectors have demanded			1
both are currently unavailable for comment			0
but source close to @entity2 told @entity76 : ' he will be on six figures at the @entity78 but paying off £ 2.5million would be a struggle for anyone			2
the megastars on big wages are able to pay but for others it is proving a huge struggle			0
' a string of celebrities including @entity38 and @entity39 may face having to pay the taxman a total of £ 1 billion in a dispute over a suspected tax avoidance scheme big names : stars like @entity35 and @entity36 are also among the 1,000 household names affected @entity25 used cash invested to help finance some of @entity54 's most successful movies under rules devised by the last @entity99			1
@entity2 and @entity3 are listed as directors between 2005 and 2011			2
other household names who invested in the firm 's ventures include the singers @entity105 and @entity107 , television presenters @entity108 and @entity110 , and @entity13 football manager @entity111 , along with football stars @entity112 and @entity114			2
those who have spoken about their investment believe they have done nothing wrong			0
last year @entity40 said he was advised that he was being ' almost philanthropic by investing in the @entity54 film industry , and that this was a scheme to promote @entity54 films ' , adding : ' at no time did i consider it solely a tax scheme			1
' proud : @entity25 has said @entity18 's demands were ' indiscriminate and unfair ' and also said their financing of films like @entity128 and @entity55 created £ 1billion in taxable income for the @entity130 @entity25 has said @entity18 's demands were ' indiscriminate and unfair '			1
a company spokesman said : ' the film partnerships run by @entity25 have already generated over £ 1bn in taxable income for the @entity130 , with more to come over the lifetime of the films they funded			2
they helped to bring movies including @entity128 , the @entity57 , the @entity62 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142 to the screen and are clearly run for profit			0
' accelerated payment notices are based on retroactive legislation and are inherently unjust			0
as regards the @entity148 , the hearing is ongoing and @entity25 remains confident of the outcome '			0
@entity150 , a spokesman for @entity25 , has said that a tax tribunal case against @entity18 is expected to finish in february			2
a ruling on whether it counts as tax avoidance will follow later this year			0
these companies helped pay for box office hits all over the world like @entity157 ( pictured ) the @entity52 government encouraged the setting up of movie production companies as a way of promoting the @entity54 film industry			1
these businesses helped pay for box office hits all over the world like @entity157			0
but it was also feared they were being exploited for tax avoidance purposes and @entity18 has since pursued investors			1
the terms of the arrangement allowed the investors - believed to have put in at least £ 100,000 each - to claim tax relief against virtually the total sum ploughed into the film by the partnership - not just the amount that they had personally put in			1
the partnerships were normally arranged under a two - for - one basis , meaning that if a celebrity put in £ 100,000 it would be matched by £ 200,000 from a film 's other backers - but the celebrity could claim tax relief on the full £ 300,000			1
the rebate had to be paid back over 15 years , but by investing the cash wisely investors could beat the taxman			0
the films did not have to qualify as @entity54			0
experts believe investors could make more money out of the delayed tax payment than they were eligible to pay			0
but @entity18 is now pursuing members and sent them accelerated payment notices - which were brought in last summer and allows the @entity130 to claw back money quickly			0
they believe the investors have gained an ' unfair tax advantage ' and owe the treasury an amount ' relating to the tax advantage that the use of the avoidance scheme tries to achieve ' , @entity18 says			1
the guidance says ' if the person does not pay the full amount shown in the notice by the date specified we may charge you a penalty '			0
that is initially five per cent of the total balance and could become at least 20 per cent on top of the bill within a year			0
many schemes like @entity25 , who have been deemed by @entity18 to be producing a tax advantage for members , have asked a court to overturn this decision			2
but the @entity130 reserves the right to hold on to any tax paid back even if they lost because they believe ' if we were successful with our appeal , you would not then pay the amount you owe ' .			0

1,000 invested around £ 100,000 in the @entity25 scheme
television football pundits @entity2 and @entity3 among them
mr @entity2 said to owe £ 2.5m and mr @entity3 seven - figures in unpaid tax
@entity239 helped finance films @entity128 and @entity55 and offered tax breaks
@entity243 , @entity35 , @entity112 said to be among investors
previous government *changed* tax rules to help the @entity54 film industry
but @entity18 has sent out bills because scheme constituted ' tax avoidance '
mr @entity3 said he paid bill swiftly when it arrived and ' always pays taxes '
