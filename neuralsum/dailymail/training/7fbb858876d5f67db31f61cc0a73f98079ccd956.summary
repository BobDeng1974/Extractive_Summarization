it is one of the most common - albeit , ineptly used - elements of the @entity3 language			0
now , an @entity5 academic has suggested that the comma could be abolished as a punctuation mark			1
professor @entity8 claims removing commas from most modern @entity5 texts would cause ' little loss of clarity ' - meaning they may now be in a state of obsolescence			1
end of the comma ? a @entity5 academic has suggested that the comma could be abolished as a punctuation mark he adds that internet users are becoming increasingly carefree in their use of the punctuation mark - with some professional writers following suit , according to @entity21			1
' [ you ] could take them out of a great deal of modern @entity5 texts and you would probably suffer so little loss of clarity that there could even be a case made for not using commas at all , ' said mr @entity8 , associate professor of @entity3 and @entity31 at @entity32			1
he highlighted the punctuation mark 's inconsistency as a further reason for its downfall - citing the @entity38 comma , which is used before the word ' and ' at the end of a list			1
' nobody has any reason for it that is scientifically sensible and logical in the sense that we know how hydrogen and oxygen combine to form water , ' he told online magazine @entity51 : doomed : professor @entity8 claims that internet users are becoming increasingly carefree in their use of commas - with some professional writers following suit ( file picture ) ' so these things are just fashions and conventions			1
' it comes as a local authority in @entity64 has been criticised over its decision to remove punctuation from street signs			2
the policy - which abolishes the use of apostrophes - says that a road called @entity72 would appear in all documentation and nameplates as ' @entity75 '			0
borrowed from @entity78 printers in the early 16th century , the comma replaced the virgule - a form of punctuation that looked like a diagonal slash - in the @entity3 language			2
until then , @entity83 writers had used the rhythms of speech to determine their use of punctuation			2
the comma is typically used to indicate an specific interpretation of the text - particularly in contexts where ambiguity might otherwise arise			0
its usage includes - but is not restricted to - singling out items in a list , separating clauses from one another , highlighting adjectives and setting out adverbs at the beginning of sentences			0
however , there are several inconsistencies in the use of the punctuation mark - for example , the @entity38 comma can be optionally used before the word ' and ' at the end of a list			1
it also bans street names which would be ' difficult to pronounce or awkward to spell ' and any which ' could give offence ' or would ' encourage defacing of nameplates '			0
last month , @entity116 , director of @entity64 - based @entity117 , condemned the the council - saying : ' i know some people think apostrophes are superfluous but we really need them and i think it ’s the first step on a slippery slope			0
' she added : ' if councils are getting rid of them , what kind of message does that give out to students at schools ? ' although similar in appearance to apostrophes , the comma is placed on the baseline of text			0
it is typically used to indicate an specific interpretation of the text - particularly in contexts where ambiguity might otherwise arise			0
its usage includes - but is not restricted to - singling out items in a list , separating clauses from one another , highlighting adjectives and setting out adverbs at the beginning of sentences @entity152 , professor of @entity3 language and literature at @entity155 , @entity38 , said a recent surge in technology had had a ' knock - on effect ' on the comma - with the punctuation mark rarely featuring in text messages and 140 - character @entity162			1
' the general tendency , especially online and in [ text messages ] , is towards lighter punctuation , and this is clearly having a knock - on effect on the use of the comma , ' he told @entity21			2
he added that ' splicing ' - where commas are used to bind two grammatically separate sentences into one - and mistakes in ' bracketing ' - where commas separate a subordinate clause from the rest of a sentence - are among the most common errors made in the use of commas .			0
