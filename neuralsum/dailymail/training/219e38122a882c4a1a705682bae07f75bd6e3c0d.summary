if you are an actor or an engineer , you are more likely to be looking for casual sex than a long - term relationship , according to new research published by dating app @entity5			1
the newly - published survey , which polled more than 33,000 of the app ’s users , aged between 18 and 60 , on their relationship requirements , revealed that the majority of professionals fall into clear career stereotypes when it comes to their sexual desires - and states exactly which industries tend to be focused on friendship and romance , and which are more interested in quick flings and one - night stands			1
while accountants , psychologists and nurses were deemed to be more likely to seek out long - term relationships , the app claims that actors and engineers are n’t often looking for anything more serious than a brief romantic encounter			2
perhaps unsurprisingly , the majority of doctors and lawyers , many of whom have commit to extensive training before even qualifying , included in the survey said they were only looking for friends			2
the most popular category to span the majority of professions was singles in search of a more casual relationship , with the majority of journalists , police officers , teachers , publicists , scientists , advertising professionals , construction workers and musicians , all falling under that same label			0
but despite the clear evidence proving that our relationships are influenced by our career choices , @entity69 ceo @entity68 told @entity74 that the app 's researchers have n't come up with any concrete theories to explain the results			0
' but we feel how much free time you have and income might play a role , ' he said			0
' the fact that a lot of users seem to choose the casual intention might also be a way of playing it safe in order to ensure the best odds of meeting the most people			0
' friend zone : @entity5 's research suggests that doctors and lawyers are looking for something platonic , while actors and engineers are seeking hook - ups keeping it casual : a wide range of professionals , including journalists , police officers and teachers , admitted to wanting a low - key relationship lasting commitment : pharmacists , psychologists and accountants were among those in the market for a long - term relationship a second spokesperson for the app added that @entity5 's user base is 70per cent male and 30per cent female , and that respondents likely reflect that breakdown , though more specific demographics are unavailable			1
in an effort to gather more information on whether people 's jobs might affect their dating preference , @entity5 has asked its @entity127 followers to share their thoughts			2
@entity130 @entity129 echoed the poll 's findings , tweeting : ' i 'm an actor / journalist			0
and i 'm looking for a casual hook - up			1
' @entity136 , who identifies herself as a ' writer and quintessential pr girl ' , meanwhile , noted that she has a boyfriend despite having a job in the ' casual ' category , writing : ' hahah @ mikeyryan23 we defied the odds			0
' @entity69 , which launched in april , is a location - based dating app similar to @entity145 in that users scroll through matches and indicate whether they 're interested - but unlike @entity145 , it allows users to revisit potential connections at a later time			1

@entity5 , a new dating app , polled 33,000 users between the ages of 18 and 60 on their relationship intentions
