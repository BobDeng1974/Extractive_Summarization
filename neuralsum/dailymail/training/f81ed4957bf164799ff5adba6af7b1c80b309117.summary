by @entity0 how do you make sure people pick up their dog ’s mess ? that ’s something researchers have been trying to figure out			1
but , in tackling this problem , they reveal some startling figures for the state of dog mess in the @entity13			1
@entity14 trained : new research suggests that a small minority of dog walkers are not pulling their weight when it comes to cleaning up their dog 's poo , leading to a problem with no clear solution the study , led by professor @entity29 at the @entity30 , ‘ sought to investigate the behaviour and attitudes of dog walkers to picking up and disposing of dog foul			1
' ‘ @entity33 waste audits were conducted on popular dog walking paths in @entity35 , ’ they wrote			1
in the research they surveyed 933 people			1
they found that most dog walkers do actually claim to clean up after their dogs			2
in fact , only three per cent were adamant they would not pick up their dog ’s poo , while just eight per cent said they would only pick it up if it was on a path			1
recent research suggests what dog owners knew all along – that they do in fact experience feelings of love and affection			2
scientists at @entity55 in @entity56 , @entity57 , discovered that a part of the brain associated with positive emotions , is similar in dogs and humans			0
they too used @entity64 scanners to examine canine brain activity			0
using hand signals to indicate the dogs were about to receive a food treat , the researchers showed that the caudate nucleus , a part of the brain associated with positive emotions , was similar in dogs and humans			0
' if , as many scientists have argued in the past , it is all simply about [ getting ] food for dogs then the reaction in their brains would be the same no matter who or what is offering them the food , ’ said neuroscientist @entity83			0
‘ we hope to show that they love us for things far beyond food , basically the same things that humans love us for , like social comfort and social bonds			0
’ while a minority , however , it is this small group that ultimately causes the problem			2
in the @entity13 1,000 tonnes of dog poo is created each day by about eight million dogs			1
even just a small percentage of this can be significant			0
abandoned dog excrement can be both harmful to humans and the environment			0
dog waste carries a large number of parasites - including hookworms , ringworms , tapeworms and @entity108			2
these parasites can cause digestive upsets , and in some cases , even blindness			0
dog waste is also full of @entity113 and other harmful bacteria including fecal coliform bacteria , which causes serious kidney disorders , intestinal illness , cramps and diarrhea in humans			2
the waste can also strain local resources when it needs to be picked up			0
according to the study , £ 22 million ( $ 37million ) is spent per year on ‘ dog waste collection ’ by local agencies in @entity126 and @entity127			1
but the threat of fines or public campaigns does n’t seem to have had an effect on this destabilising minority			0
the researchers suggest that it may be necessary to ‘ guilt ’ the minority into picking up their dog ’s waste in order to tackle the problem			1
ultimately , however they say a solution is still a way off			0
‘ it is suggested that significantly more research is required to assist in addressing this emotive yet complex problem , ’ they conclude			2
are you responsible ? keeping dogs on a leash could be one solution to the problem , say the researchers , but ultimately they 're not quite certain how to tackle the issue of growing canine waste in the @entity13			1

new research looked into how likely people were to pick up their dog 's poo
the study was carried out by the @entity30
they found that only 3 *%* would not make any effort to pick it up
but they say that @entity13 canines create 1,000 tonnes of waste a day
this makes it a growing problem , but they do *n't* know what the solution is
