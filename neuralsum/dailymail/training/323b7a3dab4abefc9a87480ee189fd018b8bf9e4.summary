@entity1 has hired a raft of medical and sleep experts to work on its @entity5 project , it has been claimed			1
it is believed the watch will be able to monitor both exercise and sleep , letting wearers track and analyse their every movement			1
although the firm has refused to confirm it is even working on a watch , experts believe it could be released this year			0
@entity27 websites reported in december 2012 that the computer giant was working with chip - maker @entity29 on a wrist - worn gadget			0
it was said to have a 1.5inch screen and use @entity33 to communicate with other devices , including an @entity35			0
other rumours suggest the @entity5 will feature @entity38 voice controls that let users dictate messages , rather than use the tiny screen			2
the watch could also be used as a remote control to change music tracks or pause video , on the phone or tablet			0
in july last year , reports in the @entity49 said @entity1 was hiring outside help to tackle design problems with its @entity5			1
further reports in september claimed @entity1 was struggling to make a number of @entity5 components , meaning the release date would be pushed back			1
@entity56 reported that @entity57 -- whose background includes working on wearables , sensors and non-pharmacological methods of improving sleep quality -- has joined @entity1 from @entity63			1
the firm is also believed to be developing a special app called @entity66 that will be built into the next version of its @entity69 software , allowing users to track and analyse the data their gadget collect			1
the firm 's @entity73 already has a movement tracking chip , called the @entity76 , which is expected to be used in the @entity5			1
reports in the @entity78 claim the first - generation smartwatch will be charged wirelessly , using existing technologies currently used with select smartphones and cases			1
yet future models of the wrist - worn technology may even be powered by solar or kinetic energy to make sure they never lose charge			0
solar panels could be fitted underneath the display of the @entity5 , for example , and harness the sun 's energy			2
@entity94 , for example , already uses solar technology in its g - shock range of watches that can receive thermal and electrical energy and use it to recharge watch batteries through solar panels on the face of the watch			2
this is further supported by the fact that in september , @entity1 posted a job vacancy looking for someone with solar expertise			2
other rumours state the watch will have a curved screen and run the next - generation of @entity1 software , likely to be called @entity69 8			1
all these current claims back up the plans laid out in an @entity1 patent filed in 2011			2
the patent described a ' wearable accessory device ' with a ' flexible display ' that could use the same technology as a child 's slap wrap to mount a flexible touchscreen on a user 's wrist			0
it also detailed a method in which the battery life could be extended , including a ' solar panel array spread across a surface of the accessory device ' , or ' a kinetic power source similar to those found on some wristwatches			0
' these current claims confirm plans laid out in an 2011 @entity1 patent			2
the patent described a ' wearable device ' with a ' flexible display ' that could use the same technology as a child 's slap wrap , patent image pictured			0
its battery life could be extended , using a ' solar panel array ' , or ' a kinetic power source other watchmakers , including @entity94 , already use solar technology in their products			0
for example , the @entity148 , pictured , can receive thermal and electrical energy and use it to recharge watch batteries through solar panels on the face of the watch ' an accessory device designed to be worn on a leg or arm could greatly benefit from this sort of power generation , and could lengthen the amount of time between charging , ' the application continued			0
similarly , a patent filed in 2009 detailed how @entity1 wanted to harness kinetic energy from the movement of an arm or leg as the wearer was walking			2
the curved screen and design rumours were bolstered by a further patent , awarded last year , which gave @entity1 the option to install a flexible battery into future products			0
last week , reports claimed @entity176 was also looking at adding a curved screen to its own next - generation smartwatch , dubbed @entity179 2			1
the original watch launched in september last year and was heavily criticised for its chunky design and poor battery life			0
elsewhere , other rumours state the watch will have a curved screen , similar to the concept images pictured , and run the next - generation of @entity1 software , likely to be called @entity69 8 some analysts claimed the device was rushed out to make sure it was one of the first on the market , beating @entity1 and @entity192 to their respective rumoured devices			1
whereas @entity1 may have delayed its own smartwatch release to learn as much about what customers liked , and did n't like , in the @entity176 version			0
since the first @entity1 @entity5 rumours emerged in 2012 , a number of artists have created concept images of what it may look like			1
many resembled the square and clunky design of @entity176 ’s @entity179 , yet the latest images from @entity206 designer @entity21 imagine a much more sleek and elegant curved device			0
@entity21 took inspiration from fitness bands , as well as the look and functionality of @entity1 ’s @entity212 , to create a watch that is ‘ like something @entity1 would actually produce			2
' the concept watch is shown as a simple band , fitted round the wrist like the @entity218 , with a curved touchscreen			0
previous @entity5 concept images , including this one from @entity222 magazine , featured a square screen , and a clunky design , that more closely resembled @entity176 's @entity179 smartwatch @entity176 beat @entity1 to the smartwatch market when it released its @entity227 - powered @entity179 , pictured , in september			1
however , its design , functionality and battery life has been heavily criticised and experts believe @entity1 may have delayed its @entity5 release to learn more about what customers like , and do n't like			1

watch could monitor sleep and movement
reports claim the first - generation @entity1 @entity5 will be wirelessly charged
@entity1 also said to be developing ' *healthbook* ' app to analyse data
