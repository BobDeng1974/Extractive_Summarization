pass master : @entity32 tops the @entity0 passing charts , with 360 successfully completed balls @entity42 passes by team passes completed by team @entity46 : @entity26 & qualifying highlights this impressive tally puts their rivals in the shade , with @entity52 the next highest but a long way behind on 2,219 attempted balls and 1,937 completed			1
@entity12 did clock up 1,574 passes in their three matches but the old sparkle was missing and they bombed out in the group stages			2
the much - admired @entity32 , who has been linked with a succession of big @entity14 clubs this year , successfully completed 360 of his 394 attempted passes - an accuracy ratio of 91 per cent			2
he is joined in the top five by team - mates @entity65 and @entity67 , cogs in the well - oiled @entity70 passing machine			1
metronome : @entity52 's @entity72 also figured highly in the passing charts with 377 played in all driving force : @entity65 carries the ball forward for @entity26 in their last - 16 tie with @entity78 total number of passes by player total number of passes completed by player shots - to - goals conversion @entity85 have been the revelation of the tournament so far and quarter - final opponents @entity88 will have to be well - drilled given their deadly accuracy in front of goal			1
@entity94 's team score with three out of every 10 shots and their rising star @entity96 has a conversion ratio of 62.5 per cent			1
with five goals to date , including that wonderful volley against @entity100 , he is leading the race for the @entity102 ahead of pre-tournament favourites @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106			2
interestingly , @entity104 and @entity106 have precisely the same record - with a conversion rate of 36.4 per cent			0
star of the tournament : @entity85 's @entity96 has been a revelation with his five goals deadly : @entity114 striker @entity113 features in the top 10 of those who best convert chances into goals percentage goals - to - shots percentage shots - to - goals by team shooting accuracy @entity114 are the most adept at working the goalkeeper , with 62.7 per cent of their efforts hitting the target			1
@entity128 's team have been free - flowing throughout the tournament , notably when they put five goals past defending champions @entity12 in their opening match			1
@entity133 , who scored twice that night , hit the target with 88.9 per cent of his shots , the second highest of all the players			0
it wo n't surprise you that @entity96 , @entity104 , @entity139 and @entity140 also feature in this particular top 10 , but @entity142 of @entity143 is the only one who found the target with every one of his chances			2
free - flowing : @entity128 has assembled a very effective and exciting @entity114 team , especially in attack perfect : every one of @entity142 's shots in the tournament was on target shooting accuracy by player shooting accuracy by team @entity46 : @entity114 & qualifying highlights @entity157 @entity159 's ' @entity158 ' were always fancied to perform well at this tournament and they have proved their class by reaching the last eight			1
they 've also fired in the most shots on target , with 32 in their four matches so far			0
however , only six of these have actually gone in			0
compare that with @entity170 , whose 31 shots on target have yielded 10 goals			0
their striker @entity175 has been responsible for 13 of these efforts			0
radar : @entity170 's @entity175 has had 13 shots on target during the @entity0 , more than any other player shots on target by player shots on target by team @entity187 @entity52 have n't been at their peak in this tournament so far and they 've been guilty of squandering a lot of chances			1
they have racked up 34 shots off target , showing that although @entity105 , @entity72 and company can create openings at will , they 're not too successful at converting them			0
in the players ' chart , @entity200 of @entity201 had the most wayward shots with 10			0
squandered : @entity201 's @entity200 fired 10 shots off target during his team 's three group games shots off target by player shots off target by team @entity213 @entity170 have one of the sharpest attacks , sticking five past @entity216 and three past @entity217 , but that haul would have been even greater had they not hit the woodwork six times			1
@entity221 and @entity222 were denied by the post or bar twice each			0
unlucky : @entity170 's @entity222 has seen two shots rebound back off the woodwork hit woodwork by player hit woodwork by team assists as mentioned earlier , @entity85 have been very impressive during this tournament and while @entity96 takes most of the plaudits , they should also be warmly thanking @entity235			1
he has contributed four assists so far			0
@entity114 's @entity237 has set up three during their run to a quarter - final with @entity241			0
architect : @entity85 's @entity235 ( centre ) has contributed four assists during the tournament creator : @entity114 's @entity237 ( right ) has set up three of his team 's goals assists @entity249 he was under enormous pressure to perform at this @entity0 and @entity105 certainly has n't let anyone down			1
as well as his four goals , he has created 18 chances with those twinkling toes			0
a spare part at @entity33 , @entity257 of @entity216 has put himself in the shop window with a number of fine displays and he set up 17 chances			0
magician : @entity105 prepares to create another chance for @entity52 - he managed 18 in four matches impressive : @entity257 of @entity216 created 17 chances for his team @entity267 : @entity105 chances created crosses he scored the winning goal on tuesday as @entity52 beat @entity216 and the stats show that @entity273 is also the crossing king of the @entity0 so far			1
the @entity275 star has swung in 33 deliveries in four matches , while @entity52 have produced 97 crosses overall			0
another @entity279 , @entity280 , has put in 23 balls , while @entity273 has also taken 17 corners			0
crossing king : @entity273 has delivered more crosses than anyone else at the @entity0 crosses by player crosses by team @entity290 no prizes for guessing who tops the leaderboard in this category			0
@entity105 is certainly not afraid to carry the @entity52 attack , as shown by 41 dribbles in the tournament to date			1
his most telling was the dazzling run that teed up @entity273 for the decisive goal against the @entity301			0
another man with the weight of the world on his shoulders , @entity88 's @entity104 , has cut loose 36 times , while @entity308 's ever - impressive @entity307 went on a run on 35 occasions			1
@entity312 skills : @entity104 charges forward to launch another @entity88 attack hands on : sometimes this was the only way to deal with @entity308 's @entity307 dribbles by player dribbles by team tackles we 're more used to seeing him score spectacular goals for @entity324 , but @entity140 is n't afraid to get stuck in either			1
the @entity88 star has made 21 tackles in the competition so far , putting him on a par with @entity52 's @entity72			2
the insatiable desire of @entity88 and @entity52 to have possession means they are first and second in the overall team chart with 94 and 93 respectively			2
getting stuck in : @entity88 's @entity140 tackles @entity334 's @entity333 during their group stage meeting tackles made by player tackles made by team @entity340 @entity342 , nursing a thigh injury , was heroic in @entity308 's loss to @entity88 and , given the brave rearguard action they mounted , it 's not a surprise to find him top of the clearances table with 40			1
that was one ahead of @entity353 's @entity352 ( 39 )			2
the @entity353 cleared the ball 165 times in all during their four matches , far more than anyone else			0
away ! @entity342 ( bottom ) with yet another clearance during @entity308 's last - 16 defeat by @entity88 clearances by player clearances by team @entity365 there have been some glorious goalkeeping performances at this @entity0 and @entity368 has been particularly impressive			1
the @entity353 stopper made a total of 27 saves in their four games			1
@entity375 's @entity374 ( 22 ) , @entity78 's @entity376 ( 20 ) and @entity216 's @entity377 ( 20 ) have also caught the eye with their shot - stopping			0
@entity382 stop : @entity368 denies @entity159 's @entity383 - no keeper has made more saves at this @entity0 saves made by player @entity388 it 's a dubious distinction to be the dirtiest player at a @entity0 and the honour goes to @entity393 's @entity392 , who conceded 16 fouls over the course of their three matches			1
of the teams still in the tournament , @entity159 's @entity398 is the most reckless with 14 fouls			1
teams wise , @entity241 have heard the referee 's whistle blow for a foul on 81 occasions			0
tough : @entity393 's @entity392 conceded 16 fouls in three matches squaring up : @entity398 in a confrontation with @entity410 of the @entity353 fouls conceded by player fouls conceded by team			1

@entity26 *replace* @entity12 as the tiki - taka masters , with @entity32 to the fore
@entity105 has carried the @entity52 attack with 40 dribbles in four games
@entity424 revelation @entity96 is the deadliest in front of goal

@entity368 pulled off 27 saves for the @entity353
