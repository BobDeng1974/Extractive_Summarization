by @entity0 published : 18:42 est , 18 august 2013 updated : 06:51 est , 19 august 2013 a mammoth fund worth £ 20 a year for every adult and child in the @entity5 should be set up to encourage cycling , the @entity1 say			1
the latest idea from the junior coalition party would cost the taxpayer more than £ 1.2billion a year at a time when public spending needs to be cut to help bring down the deficit			1
it would also give cycling as much public money as some entire departments in @entity17			0
healthy plans : the proposed budget would see £ 20 - a - year spent on each @entity5 citizen to encourage cycling however , the party will discuss plans for a ‘ cycling budget ’ at its conference next month after they were proposed by @entity27 mp @entity26			1
critics will point out that the scheme is traditional @entity1 posturing that will make very little difference to efforts to encourage more people into the saddle			1
@entity35 , conservative mp for @entity36 and @entity37 , said : ‘ getting people cycling is important , but i do n’t think this policy would work			0
' it would mean an unfunded cost of over £ 1.2billion , which would simply lead to more borrowing and more debt			2
’ on yer bikes ! the cycling budget had been proposed by @entity27 mp @entity26 @entity47 backbenchers will see the plans as merely the latest in what has been called the @entity1 ’ ‘ war on the motorist ’			1
other proposals to be discussed at the party ’s conference include automatically blaming drivers for all accidents involving cyclists using a legal system of ‘ proportionate liability ’			2
deputy prime minister @entity61 ’s party also wants to ban all petrol and diesel cars by 2040			0
their ‘ cycling budget ’ motion would see the creation of a budget worth £ 10 per person , increasing later to £ 20 a head			1
the most recent official estimates put the @entity5 population at 63.2million			2
so at £ 20 per person , mr @entity26 ’s scheme would cost £ 1.26billion per year – the equivalent cost of 41,489 soldiers			1
funding the cycling policy would mean slashing the total number of @entity80 personnel in half			0
it is also the equivalent cost of taking 31,752 policemen off the streets , 48,672 nurses out of hospital wards , or removing 39,371 teachers from schools			0
the budget ’s size is also comparable with some government departments			0
in 2014/15 , the amount of taxpayers ’ money allocated to the @entity96 is expected to be about £ 1.35billion			0
the @entity1 ’s spending proposals do not stop there			2
mr @entity26 ’s motion also calls for an increase in the ‘ local sustainable transport fund ’ , better integration of the cycle network and the creation of more cycle paths .			0

new plan would see £ 20 - a - year spent on each @entity5 citizen
