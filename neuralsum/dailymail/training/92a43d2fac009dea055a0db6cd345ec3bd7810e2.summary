@entity0 helped pull off the £ 3m deal that has seen his teenage midfielder swap @entity9 for the @entity12 capital on a six - year deal			1
such is @entity4 's faith in the 18 - year - old @entity16 , they insisted on inserting a clause in @entity3 's contract stating that interested parties must fork out a staggering £ 48m to land the @entity21 under - 21 player in future			1

@entity7 chairman @entity0 said the move should encourage @entity1 's other coveted kids to aim for the very top - on the day the club rejected bids in excess of £ 1m from @entity49 for highly - rated @entity21 left - back @entity50			1
' it 's never easy to let one of your best players go but it was a fantastic deal for the club and a fantastic opportunity for @entity3 , ' said @entity0			2
' let 's just say we are happy with the contract and that if he moves on further down the line then we will get benefits from that as well			0
' i think this deal puts @entity1 on the map			2
' how many times do you see a young home - grown @entity70 player get a transfer like this ? not very often			1
' it 's big news over in @entity12 and in @entity76			0
alike ? @entity3 has been nicknamed ' @entity77 ' due to similarities in playing style next in line ? @entity3 will hope to follow in the footsteps of @entity82 at @entity4 ' in terms of marketing ourselves as a place where talent is developed and then sold on , this deal is very good for the club			1
' it is also very good for the other young players here			0
they could n't get any better encouragement			0
' if @entity3 can do it , they 'll want to			2
' @entity0 , who refused to speak about @entity49 's interest in @entity50 , maintains the deal to sell @entity3 was simply too good for the club to turn down			0
and he warned other sides watching @entity50 , @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 , that his gifted kids wo n't be allowed to leave on the cheap			0
@entity0 said : ' a lot of work has been put in to developing the likes of @entity3 and getting him and others on long - term contracts so we can get a decent transfer fee like this one			1
it 's about the business side of things as much as the football side			0
' @entity3 's money - spinning transfer will slightly strengthen boss @entity118 's arm when it comes to bringing more new faces to the club this summer			2
