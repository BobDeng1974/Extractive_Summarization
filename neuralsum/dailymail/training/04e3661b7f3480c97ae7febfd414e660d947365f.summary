by @entity0 for @entity1 and @entity2 for @entity1 new details about repeated calls made to @entity7 airliner @entity5 shortly after it disappeared from radar suggest the missing plane turned south earlier than previously thought and may alter the planned search area			1
a year long deep sea search of the @entity12 is set commence in september , six months after the plane first went missing			1
deputy prime minister @entity14 said the search area could be extended farther south based on analysis of the calls airline officials made to plane from the ground			1
a year long search will commence in september investigators have only recently worked out a way to analyse the call data despite having access to it for months , @entity33 reported			1
@entity40 chief commissioner @entity39 said he would meet with international experts next week to decide whether the 60,000 square kilometre ( 23,000 square mile ) targeted search area should be extended or shifted further south based on the new analysis			2
' we think we may extend that area farther south ; that 's the thing we 're currently considering , ' he said the new analysis applies to satellite data from the first of two satellite phone calls @entity51 ground staff attempted to make to flight 370 's crew			1
in @entity22 , deputy prime minister @entity14 ( pictured left ) met with his @entity7 ( middle ) and @entity24 counterparts ( right ) and said they were cautiously optimistic the aircraft will be recovered			2
by the time the calls were attempted , the plane had become invisible to civilian radar			2
it had flown west without communications past @entity63 and beyond the range of @entity7 military radar			2
mr @entity39 said the new analysis suggested the jet was already flying south when the first phone call was attempted less than 20 minutes after the plane dropped off military radar			1
' previously , there was the possibility that it could have been quite a bit later , so we had to do our modelling based on a range of possibilities as to where the aircraft turned , ' he said			2
' we 're now more confident that it turned comparatively early			0
that does make a difference to how we prioritise the search along the seventh arc , ' he added , referring to the area where satellite information from a jet engine transmitter suggests the plane ran out of fuel and crashed			2
the southern part of the search zone will be prioritised looking for @entity5 and will see towed vehicles equipped with sonar and video cameras , dragged along the sea floor , off the coast of @entity95			1
in @entity22 , deputy prime minister @entity14 met with his @entity7 and @entity24 counterparts and said they were cautiously optimistic the aircraft will be recovered			0
the 1.1 million square kilometres search zone remains the same size but authorities have been able to make refinements with satellite data			1
@entity104 search areas planning map			0
a year long deep sea search for the missing @entity7 airlines plane will commence in september ' the ( data ) expanded our knowledge of the area , indicating depths up to 1500 metres deeper than previously known , and the identification of two underwater volcanos , ' said mr @entity14			1
the expensive $ 52 million pricetag will be split between @entity30 and @entity7			1
' we have so far committed and spent about $ 15 million ( aud ) and we are also going to match the @entity116 in the tender cost for this search for @entity5			1
we need to find the plane , we need to find the black box to come to a conclusion , ' said @entity7 transport minister @entity122			2
@entity123 reported that @entity30 had budgeted up to $ 90 million over the next two years to find the plane but there 's question over whether it would be extended over that period			1
' @entity7 ’s pledge continued and unwavering support in response to the unprecedented nature and scale of this event through our financial commitment , technical expertise , equipment , and stamina in our search for answers , ' said mr @entity14			2
but it 's a race against time			0
more than 200 people have been employed by @entity144 surveying group @entity143 to get the job done as quickly as possible			2
they have a one - year deadline in which to find wreckage of the ill - fated @entity5 , before they will be forced to move on by the @entity40 ( @entity40 )			1
on board with the @entity151 as crews prepare surveying equipment for the next stage of the search for @entity5 @entity143 must follow the lead provided by the @entity40			1
forming part of its contractual arrangements is that the current search site is to be analysed for a maximum of 12 months			0
‘ we know the time frame we have is about a year , after that we ’ll be working in a new box as provided by the @entity40 – they ’re always refining their data and if they decide before that it ( the plane wreckage ) may be further south or north , they can order us to move at any time , ' said @entity143 managing director , @entity173			1
‘ there ’s certainly no time to waste			0
' ‘ we ’ve got one year to search inside our designated box , if you like , before moving on			0
' the images ( below ) of the search process which have been provided to @entity1 by @entity143 , give a sense of what the @entity144 team is up against			1
the @entity143 , which is 65 metres long , is highlighted by the small circle , dwarfed by the great expanses of the southern @entity12			2
it has just returned to the area after a crew change			0
in a setback for the operation , mr @entity186 said the sister ship , @entity189 , has had to be diverted via @entity190 and away from the @entity191 ' because we were worried about pirates , even though we went through the process of hardening the boat '			0
that included placing barbed wire right about @entity189 to try and prevent any potential hijacking			0
it should arrive in mid-september , about 10 days later than expected			0
' i ’ve got guys visiting factories all around the world looking for the necessary equipment to make this a success , ' mr @entity186 said			0
surveying crews are working against time to give a more accurate account of the sea - bed ahead of sensors being sent down			1
in some cases there will be a drop of 5000 metres but there are differences of up to 500 metres in some areas which need to be mapped before scanning equipment is sent down			0
using its advanced survey vessel , the @entity151 , fitted with state - of - the art multibeam echosounder equipment , @entity143 is conducting a bathymetric survey of the search area			1
the seabed data obtained will assist in the production of maps of the seabed off @entity30			0
@entity143 will spend more than $ 52 million in the next year in the search for @entity5			1
200 personnel will work on the project and are ' finding equipment from factories @entity231 ' mapping work continues in the area designated by the @entity40 , as @entity143 try to make the most of every possible minute			0
‘ they ( the @entity40 ) have done most of the research and determined the suitable box in which we should operate , ’ he said			0
that ‘ box ’ he refers to is in fact 60,000 square kilometres of the southern @entity12 , an area approximately the size of @entity242 , 1600 kilometres off the @entity30 coast			1
‘ we are looking for a debris field at the end of the day and we ’re basing it on a lot of methodology from previous searches , ’ mr @entity186 said			0
optimistically , he added that ‘ we expect to see a debris field ’			0
‘ we are also expecting , in a worst - case scenario , that we will see an engine because one of our proving tests shows that we can identify 2 metre by 2 metre cubed object			0
inside the control room on board the @entity151 where teams will monitor the progress of search equipment scouring the sea bed of the southern @entity12 for debris from @entity5 the @entity151 with a new crew on board is now on its way out to the southern @entity12 for a third mission searching for the wreckage of @entity5			1
@entity143 has 200 people working on the project , around the world ‘ we ’ll run over our proving range and start mowing the lawn , so to speak			1
that 's when we tow our sensors along the bottom			0
' that 's very difficult because of what is down there and part of why the @entity282 were unsuccessful - it 's very deep water we 're working in and there are variances of up to 500 metres or more in some places			0
‘ but our expectations coupled with the data we have gathered to date , is that it is sitting proud somewhere on the sea - bed			1
‘ i ’m not really sure how this will search will end up , it ’s a massive area about the size of @entity242 and the engine you could equate to the size of two big blokes – not an easy task			0
’ the search conducted by the @entity144 firm @entity143 will focus on a 60,000 square kilometre stretch of the @entity12 off the @entity190 coast @entity143 ceo @entity303 with a model of the two ships which are involved in the search for @entity5 @entity5 went missing on march 8 on the way from @entity308 to @entity309 with 239 people on board , including six @entity116 and 153 @entity24 nationals			1
initial analysis of radar data and satellite communication messages following its disappearance indicated it most likely crashed in the southern @entity12 , 2,500km south - west of @entity95			2
but despite an international search effort led by @entity30 and operated out of the @entity321 air force base in @entity95 , no debris from the plane has been found			1
troubled carrier @entity51 is set to be de-listed and made private as part of a major restructure following the twin disasters of @entity5 and @entity324 the first phase of the search for the missing plane was a surface search of probable impact areas , conducted by an international fleet of aircraft and ships , which concluded on april 28			1
an acoustic search , accompanied by a search of the ocean floor in the vicinity of the acoustic detentions was then conducted , also without success			0
the ocean floor search was completed on may 28			0
as part of a major restructure , the @entity7 government recently confirmed that the troubled airline will be de-listed and made private			2
significant job losses are expected			0
the overhaul comes after three unprofitable years and the double disasters of @entity5 and @entity324			0
mr @entity14 and mr @entity122 also discussed ongoing recovery efforts for @entity324 - the @entity51 jet downed by a missile strike over eastern @entity348 on july 17 , killing 298 people , including 38 @entity116 .			2

a year long deep sea search for @entity5 to start in september
new details about calls made to the airliner shortly after it dropped off radar suggest the plane turned south earlier than previously thought
officials are now considering shifting the search zone farther south
$ 52 million search cost split between @entity30 and @entity7
new images show how @entity143 crews will conduct sea - bed search for @entity5
vehicles will search sea floor , 1600km off @entity30 coast
@entity51 *passenger* plane , carrying 239 people , vanished in march
