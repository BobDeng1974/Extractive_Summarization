i 've wanted @entity2 's hair from the age of five , and i want it just as much now , at the age of 27			2
not just long hair , but endless tumbling waves that fall heavy over my shoulders and constantly get in the way with all their weighty glory			2
in the past , i 've had extensions which always tended to look a bit straggly , and very obviously alien to the rest of my locks			1
and , i reasoned , if even the minted likes of @entity16 and @entity17 ca n't seem to get them right , then maybe no amount of money can buy that sort of hair			2
but one @entity24 - based hair guru , @entity23 , claims to have mastered a ' couture ' method so streamlined that @entity2 hair really can be yours , and with not a single tell - tale sign of its fakery			1
mr @entity23 has been in the business for more than 20 years , long before extensions really got popular , and is widely hailed these days as ' the @entity45 of hair extensions			1
' he sources human locks from around the world and runs his own ' hair laboratory ' , where technicians match the color , the texture and the shape of every strand of hair to the samples he takes from his clients			1
prices range from $ 500 to $ 4,000 and depend entirely on the type , color and amount of hair you want			1
mine - 18 inches of premium @entity65 hair - are worth an eye - watering $ 3,600			1
customized : mr @entity23 ( right ) sources human locks from around the world and runs his own ' hair laboratory ' which matches the extensions specifically to the client			1
pictured , my 18 inches of ' premium @entity65 hair ' painstaking : the segments were fused to tiny sections of my hair and secured with thin metal ' micro-rings ' bit - by - bit , layer - by - layer ( pictured ) hidden : mr @entity23 steered clear of the sections too close to my hair line so that i 'd be able to tie my hair up without the rings being visible ( pictured ) ta - da ! the process took a lengthy five hours to complete , after which i was treated to a ' shaping ' trim and a blowout ( pictured ) first came my consultation , during which i explained what i wanted in forensic detail - ' @entity2 hair ... literally , literally , @entity2 hair ' - while he tossed my mane around and took sneaky snippings as he went			1
it 's important , mr @entity23 says , to take samples from the front , the back , the top and the underneath of the hair , because most of us have different textures in different areas			1
i 'd never noticed this before , but it is definitely true			0
then we discussed the sort of wave i wanted , because apparently there are a plethora of those too			0
i opted for a ' loose @entity114 ' variety			0
finally , i was politely informed that my color was drab , and was whisked off to have it corrected by his colorist			0
it took a week for mr @entity23 's lab team to prepare the hair , after which i was called in for my marathon application session			1
volume : mr @entity23 , a huge fan of ' voluptuous locks ' , ruffles and coils my hair as i seemingly ponder the meaning of human existence hair today , gone tomorrow : it 's recommended i return within two to four months , depending on how i 'm doing , to have the extensions removed options : personally i prefer a reasonably natural finish ( left ) but if the urge ever does strike me , glossy ringlets can be mine too ( right ) the two ponytails mr @entity23 presented me with were made up from hundreds of minute individual threads of hair , bonded at their ' roots '			1
the more of them they are , he says , the better they will blend in with my own hair			2
next , after my hair was washed and dried thoroughly , it was time for the painstaking process of attaching someone else 's locks - whomever they may be - to my own , which was always going to be a weird feeling			1
the segments were fused to tiny sections of my hair and secured with thin metal ' micro-rings ' bit - by - bit , layer - by - layer			0
mr @entity23 steered clear of the sections too close to my hair line so that i 'd be able to tie my hair up without the rings being visible			1
it took five hours , but i was plied with a selection of beverages and kept comfortable throughout			0
then and now : the extensions when i first had them done ( left ) and three months on , without styling ( right ) once mr @entity23 had finished , great hunks of thick hair reached my elbows , which felt heavenly but definitely looked wig - like			1
the final step , ' the shaping ' , he assured me , was the most important			0
off he set in the manor of @entity171 , hacking into my extremely long hair so that it fell into subtle layers leaving tendrils scattered on the floor			0
true to his word , the finished result post-blowout - if a little coiffed and ' overdone ' for my liking - was impressive			0
my hair was unfeasibly long and thick , and very much felt like my own			0
for two nights following the procedure , sleeping was excruciatingly painful ; how it might feel to have hundreds of little goblins yanking incessantly on small chunks of your hair			0
entirely normal , i hear			0
pitfalls : @entity16 ( left and right ) tends to have extensions that fail to blend in with her own hair , particularly color-wise on show : @entity17 ( left ) has long been a wearer of blonde extensions , but often has them fitted too high - up and close to her hairline , as does @entity197 ( center ) and @entity199 ( right ) once the pain subsided , and after i 'd washed my hair , i truly fell in love with the results			2
the extensions hang naturally , they 're not poker straight nor artificially wavy , and they move with my own hair			2
i barely have to touch them with a styling implement to make them feel nice			0
in fact , i think they look best completely natural , which far from being high - maintenance like extensions i 've had in the past , saves me a boatload of time and hassle			0
mr @entity23 recommends i return within two to four months , depending on how i 'm doing , to have them removed			1
any longer and the hair grows too far out from the roots and gets tangled above the micro-rings			0
getting it right : @entity223 's extensions match her natural hair perfectly ( left ) and @entity225 is rarely without hers , which are thick and luxurious ( right ) faithful falsies : @entity227 would n't dream of charging down the @entity229 runway without her wavy extensions in ( left ) , and @entity231 has been a fan of hers for years ( right ) @entity233 lengths : @entity234 once rather successfully lengthened her locks ( left ) from a previously short , boyish cut , while @entity237 often appears with sudden fountains of wavy hair ( right ) for between $ 350 and $ 450 , you can have the extensions re-applied when the time comes			1
if you opt for this , the salon removes them , washes and freshens up your natural hair and then reapplies them exactly as before , using new micro-rings , as well as throwing a few new sections in for volume			2
this can be done between two and four times in total , due to shedding over time , meaning that the most you get out of them is nine to 12 months			0
these extensions may be far from cheap , or be quite long enough for a prince to clamber up them , but the feeling of having locks long enough to fall into my soup , flop onto my keyboard , and genuinely get in my way feels exactly as good as i always hoped it would .			2
