by @entity1 reporter published : 23:07 est , 28 february 2013 updated : 14:14 est , 1 march 2013 not giving in : house speaker @entity2 said that he feels the @entity3 have done enough to help try to avoid the cuts and it not willing to concede to all of president @entity6 's requests @entity7 is just hours from crippling spending cuts as @entity9 heads into the dreaded sequester at the stroke of midnight on friday			1
the law simply says that ' on march 1 , 2013 , the president shall order a sequestration for fiscal year 2013			2
' that means that at any point in the day on friday , president @entity6 can issue the beginning of the sequestration where all facets of government will be forced to cut a collective $ 85billion between that point and october 1			1
@entity22 press secretary @entity21 says that means midnight , friday - or as close to midnight as possible - 11.59 p.m. and 59 seconds - because , @entity21 says , @entity6 is ' ever hopeful			1
' after failed attempts at reaching a compromise in order to avoid the $ 85billion in budget cuts that will go into effect on friday , president @entity6 and @entity3 blamed each other for the latest outbreak of gridlock			1
the immediate impact of the reductions on the public was uncertain , and the administration pulled back on its earlier warnings of long lines developing quickly at airports and teacher layoffs affecting classrooms			0
looming nightmare : the $ 85billion in spending cuts will begin to go into effect just after 11.50 pm on thursday because the two sides were unable to agree to a compromise not good : @entity22 press secretary @entity21 said that the president had attempted to compromise but the @entity3 would not allow for tax increases on wealthy corporations @entity52 @entity53 transportation and recreation public schools @entity57 health and safety ' ( @entity3 ) voted to let the entire burden of deficit reduction fall squarely on the middle class , ' president @entity6 wrote in a statement in response to the inaction on the @entity71 floor , a @entity3 proposal requiring @entity6 to propose alternative cuts that would cause less disruption in essential government services fell to overwhelming @entity73 opposition , 62 - 38			1
moments later , a @entity73 alternative to spread the cuts over a decade and replace half with higher taxes on millionaires and corporations won a bare majority , 51 - 49 , but that was well shy of the 60 needed to advance			2
republicans opposed it without exception			0
in a written statement after the votes , @entity6 lambasted @entity3			1
' they voted to let the entire burden of deficit reduction fall squarely on the middle class , ' he said			0
he noted that he would meet with congressional leaders from both parties at the @entity22 on friday , but no one is expecting action before the cuts begin taking effect			1
the full brunt of the automatic cuts will be borne over seven months and @entity98 can stop them at any time if the two parties agree on how to do so			2
that makes it difficult to say how the belt tightening will hit ordinary @entity7			0
president @entity6 's administration is warning that @entity108 ships could lie idle and children would lose out on vaccinations if the cuts are not halted			1
' @entity6 and @entity71 @entity73 are demanding more tax hikes to fuel more " stimulus " spending , ' house speaker @entity2 said put into law in 2011 as part of a bipartisan solution to an earlier fiscal emergency , sequestration is unloved by both parties because of the economic pain it will cause			1
few believed two years ago that the cuts would come into force but , unable to agree on any other way to reduce the budget deficit , political leaders are pointing fingers at each other now that the spending reductions appear inevitable			1
' it is the president 's sequester			0
it was his team that insisted upon it , ' @entity3 @entity134 speaker @entity2 said			1
@entity22 spokesman @entity21 said @entity3 ' refusal to compromise by agreeing to close tax loopholes on the wealthy was one reason why the cuts might be unavoidable			2
' compromise represents willingness to accept policies that are n't 100 percent of what you want			0
the president has done that again and again			0
unfortunately , @entity3 seem to be unwilling to do that when it comes to the sequester , so the sequester may take place , ' he told reporters			2
@entity6 wants to end tax breaks for oil and gas companies and the lower ' carried interest ' tax rate enjoyed by hedge funds			2
@entity161 slips : thousands are expected to be put on unpaid leave ( furloughs ) but @entity73 are now painting the pink slips as coming from the desk of the @entity3 @entity21 said both sides had agreed to the spending cuts , half of which will come from the defense budget and half from non-defense domestic programs			1
' it was designed as policy that would never come into effect			0
because it was so onerous for both sides , it would compel @entity98 to reach a compromise , ' @entity21 said			2
the cuts total $ 85billion through the end of the current budget year - september 30 - half each from defense and non-defense programs			1
large parts of the budget are off - limits , including programs for veterans , @entity190 and @entity192 benefits			0
though furloughs are a fear for some - especially certain federal workers - there is little sign of business worry , let alone panic in the nation			0
stocks declined slightly for the day after trading near record highs			0
unlike the ' fiscal cliff ' showdown of two months ago , there are no deadlines for action to prevent tax increases from hitting nearly every @entity7			0
over the past two years , @entity6 and congressional republicans have agreed to more than $ 3.6trillion in long - term deficit savings over a decade			1
none of the savings to date has come from the big benefit programs that lawmakers in both parties say must be tackled if the country is to gain control over its finances			0
each party fears the political fallout of confronting them on their own , but @entity73 , in particular , are reluctant to scale back programs that they count as their political birthright			0
while the @entity22 has issued a steady stream of severe warnings about the impact of across - the - board cuts , the president said wednesday night , ' this is not a cliff , but it is a tumble downward			2
it 's conceivable that in the first week , the first two weeks , the first three weeks , the first month ... a lot of people may not notice the full impact of the sequester			0

politicians *imposed* law two years ago that set today as the deadline to find ways to cut $ 85billion in spending , hoping that the two parties would find a way to compromise
they were unable to reach a *settlement* so now the harsh budget cuts will go into effect meaning that thousands face possible *unemployment*
president @entity6 and @entity3 house speaker @entity2 will meet on friday in last - ditch effort to reach a deal
