' the defendants retained the profits that were there to be made and @entity3 owned an @entity106 convertible car , thought to be worth around £ 45,000			1

' when people have lost their pride and hope , they are likely to become pathetically reliant on anybody that offers them any sort of scraps			0
' i ’m satisfied the reason these two men stayed and did not make further efforts to get away was because they had that pathetic gratefulness for the things they were given			0
' vulnerable people have to be safeguarded			0
' some men working for the @entity67 said they were happy with their lot , the court heard			0
