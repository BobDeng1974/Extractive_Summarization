inspiring cynicism : @entity1 pledged to vote against a rise in tuition fees - a promise he later broke , infuriating many youngsters young people are less supportive of the welfare state than their parents , more likely to believe that people should look after themselves , and less trusting of their neighbours , a @entity7 report has found			1
in what is described as ‘ a clear generational shift ’ , those who grew up under @entity17 and @entity18 are more ‘ individualist ’ and appear to be more cynical and more suspicious that the benefits system is being abused			0
the @entity21 findings indicate that individualism is the most pronounced among @entity23 , those born after 1980 into the early 2000s			1
the report stresses that this trait does not mean those in their 20s and early 30s are more selfish than older generations because they are just as likely to value the welfare of others			0
while the shift in attitudes could be good news for the @entity36 , which hopes to combat the benefits culture , and bad news for @entity39 , which promotes the welfare state , @entity23 are less likely to vote , according to the findings			1
the wide - ranging report also found : - children are set to live with their parents for longer ; - political engagement among the young is set to decline further , with even fewer voting in elections ; - there will be a slow decline of religious identification , pushing us further towards a secular society ; - @entity52 could increasingly be called on to look after young children – as they are expected to stay in the workplace for longer ; - there could be a future of less - secure jobs for the young – but there are signs that many have reacted to the economic crash by becoming more entrepreneurial than their forebears ; - for some , the effect of the internet and the prevalence of technology could have a ‘ negative impact ’			1
the study concluded that while there was much to be positive about , ‘ there are also potential concerns , for instance around declining mainstream political engagement , low levels of social trust and the potential negative impacts of digital technologies ’			0
the @entity21 report was compiled by the government ’s ‘ horizon scanning programme ’ , which looks at policies that may be needed in the coming decade to react to changes in society			1
it was based on numerous sources , including focus groups and an @entity88 survey published in 2013			0
that study found only 23 per cent of those in @entity23 said they agreed that ‘ the government should spend more money on welfare benefits for the poor , even if it leads to higher taxes ’ , compared to 37 per cent of those who were born before the war			1
the welfare state is most identified with the @entity39 government of 1945 to 1951 , which set up the @entity102 and replaced the @entity104 poor law with social security			0
those who grew up under @entity17 ( centre ) and @entity18 ( behind her to the left ) are more ‘ individualist ’ and appear to be more cynical and more suspicious that the benefits system is being abused however , much of it was questioned during the 1980s and 1990s during the @entity36 premierships of @entity17 and sir @entity18			0
now major elements are being cut back in the wake of the economic crisis			0
for example , a cap has been imposed on the amount a family can claim in handouts			0
the report , which was published late last month , says that the generational shift away from support for the welfare state appears to have occurred ‘ partly [ because of ] a view that the system is abused by many people and partly due to an emphasis on personal autonomy ’			1
it continues : ‘ @entity23 is more likely than other cohorts to believe the role of the state should be more focused on providing opportunities and less on managing the risks individuals face			2
this suggests that @entity23 is a more “ individualist ” generation than the others , more concerned with personal independence and opportunity than compulsory systems of risk - pooling and redistribution			0
’ ‘ however , younger people are no less likely to think that specific groups , such as the elderly , the disabled and low - income working families need to be supported			2
’ it added : ‘ young people attach as much value to the welfare of others as older generations			2
’ the report said that , in general , the future looks bright for young adults			0
but there is much uncertainty around the ‘ changing nature of the youth labour market ’			2
‘ some commentators argue that we are seeing a change in the nature of the youth job market towards fewer , less secure jobs , ’ it said			2
however , one positive note is that the economic downturn may have made young people more entrepreneurial			0
‘ there is some evidence of an increase in the numbers of young people that aim to start or are in the process of starting a business , ’ it said			1
the report also warns of the potential dangers of technology			0
‘ there is clear evidence that moderate use of technology is likely to have significant positive impacts on wellbeing , but that for the small minority of young people who use technology heavily , there could be a range of negative impacts , related to , for instance , “ sexualisation ” , the influence of violent video games and cyber-bullying , ’ it said			2
economy left them reliant on bank of @entity203 and @entity204 children are likely to live with their parents for longer and rely increasingly on the ‘ bank of mum and dad ’ , the report predicts			1
the rising costs of housing and the trend towards studying for longer means that today ’s children face an ‘ extended path to full adulthood ’			1
this will lead to a new life stage of ‘ emerging adulthood ’ , the report predicts , as young people take longer to achieve full independence from their parents			1
more and more youngsters are relying on their parents for finance , with up to two thirds asking them to help fund a deposit for a first house			0
children are likely to live with their parents for longer and rely increasingly on the ‘ bank of mum and dad ’ , the report predicts ( file pictures ) all this could have a ‘ detrimental impact ’ on social mobility in the future – because while the middle classes will support their children , poorer parents will be unable to do so			1
the report said : ‘ as young people struggle to become financially independent , they are taking longer to move out of their family home , have children , get married and buy their own home			1
‘ for more advantaged young people who can depend on parental support , this time is often spent in full - time education can be characterised as a time of opportunities and experimentation			0
for young people who can not depend on this support , it is likely to be a more precarious and less positive experience			0
’ the report also said that ‘ multi-generational households ’ may become more common in the future , and relationships could be ‘ reshaped ’ by increasing mutual dependence , particularly as older people will increasingly be expected to provide childcare for their offspring			1
but , far from being a return to tight - knit families , the report warned that the demands of work will mean parents and children live further apart in the future , limiting the ‘ contact and support available ’ .			2

today *'s* youth feel people should stand on their own two feet , report finds
they are less likely to vote or say they are religious , according to @entity21 findings
but the report finds ' @entity23 ' are more likely to start up a business
children to rely increasingly on ‘ bank of mum and dad ’ , report predicts
