by @entity0 @entity1 : 13:18 est , 22 december 2013 @entity2 : 05:50 est , 23 december 2013 alzheimer 's disease could be diagnosed earlier after scientists pinpointed where it starts in the brain			1
the discovery means patients could benefit from starting treatment sooner			0
researchers scanned the brains of 96 pensioners and tracked their health for three - and - a - half years			0
none had memory problems at the start of the study but 12 had developed mild @entity19 's by the end			0
discovery : this computer - generated image shows the results of the findings - that @entity19 's disease begins in the entrohinal cotrex ( shown in yellow ) , and then spreads to other cortical regions ( shown in red ) by closely examining the results from 96 adults , the scientists were able to see that , while 84 of the brains remained normal , the 12 which came to develop @entity19 's shows reduced metabolic activity in the @entity39 area			1
the change , associated with declining memory , occurred at a time when all 12 volunteers were free of dementia			0
the study also showed how over time the effects of @entity19 's spread from the @entity39 to other areas of the brain 's cerebral cortex			1
one region especially targeted was the parietal cortex , an area involved in functions including spatial orientation and navigation			0
lead researcher professor @entity57 , director of @entity59 's @entity58 , said : ' it has been known for years that @entity19 's starts in a brain region known as the entorhinal cortex			1
but this study is the first to show in living patients that it begins specifically in the lateral entorhinal cortex , or @entity39			1
' the @entity39 is considered to be a gateway to the hippocampus , which plays a key role in the consolidation of long - term memory , among other functions			1
if the @entity39 is affected , other aspects of the hippocampus will also be affected			2
' research : the insight into the debilitating disease was carried out by @entity59 's @entity58 the scientists suspect @entity19 's spreads through a kind of ' domino effect ' , whereby neurons affected in the @entity39 reduce the ability of neurons around them to resist the change			1
two of the hallmarks of alzheimer 's disease are sticky protein deposits in the brain called beta amyloid plaques , and ' tangles ' of tau protein			2
a first step to accumulating beta amyloid is the production of amyloid precursor protein ( @entity100 )			0
' the lec is especially vulnerable to @entity19 's because it normally accumulates tau , which sensitises the @entity102 to the accumulation of @entity100 , ' said co-author professor @entity104			0
' together , these two proteins damage neurons in the @entity39 , setting the stage for @entity19 's			2
' tests on mice confirmed that the same changes in the @entity39 seen in the volunteers were associated with raised tau and @entity100 the researchers used a high - resolution form of functional magnetic resonance imaging ( @entity115 ) to map metabolic activity in the brains of the study participants			1
' now that we 've pinpointed where @entity19 's starts , and shown that those changes are observable using @entity115 , we may be able to detect @entity19 's at its earliest preclinical stage , when the disease might be more treatable and before it spreads to other brain regions , ' said prof @entity57			2
the new imaging method could also be used to assess potential new drug treatments at early stages of the disease , said the researchers .			0

scientist from @entity59 in @entity133 made the discovery
they found the disease starts in the lateral entorhinal cortex ( @entity39 )
it is linked to the part of the brain where long - term memories are *stored*
study also *outlined* how the disease spreads from the @entity39 to the rest of the brain
