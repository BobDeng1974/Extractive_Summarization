@entity0 turned up to work at @entity3 's cafe - restaurant in @entity4 , @entity5 on wednesday knowing that she needed a miracle			1
as she left her house there was a disconnection notice on the door that her electricity was about to be shut off - one of many bills that amounted this month after the 26 - year - old wife was forced to give up her shifts and rush to @entity16 to be with her mom , who had suffered a heart attack			1
' all i wanted was to see my mother one more time , ' a teary @entity19 told @entity22			1
' with @entity24 's help , i managed to make it up there driving in the middle of the big snow storm that hit earlier this month			2
little did she know she would be able to pay her overdue bills thanks to the kindness of some customers ' i was able to see her and she pulled through , thankfully			2
' but when she returned home , her financial woes awaited			0
' it started to sink in how much work i missed and that i was not going to be able to pay all of my bills , ' she said			1
' i 've been trying to pick up any extra shifts that i can			0
' i was thinking i 'm really going to need a miracle to pay my bills this month			2
' her shift started normally and , being mid-week , business was fairly slow			0
among the customers were a husband and a wife and their small child			0
' they really did not stand out , ' @entity19 recalled			2
' they were just nice folks			2
i remember talking to them and having a friendly conversation like you would with a neighbor			0
act of pure kindness : the check and the note the family left ' the father ordered a country steak			1
the mother and son split a fish taco			0
' they were really humble people			0
' the bill was $ 29.30 after tax , but the receipt was turned upside down when @entity19 went to clear the table , which is usually a bad sign			1
' normally , as a server , when a receipt is turned upside down it means you did not get a good tip or any tip , ' she said			1
' or people will leave a nasty note about how you messed something up with their service			2
i remember thinking , '' i wonder what i did wrong ''			0
however the receipt turned @entity19 's life upside down			1
' i just remember seeing a comma after the one and knew it was n't $ 10			0
and i was like , '' oh , my @entity24 ! '' and i just lost my balance and i was like , ' does this say a thousand dollars ? ' i could not believe it			0
' @entity0 promises to one day return the favor to someone else that is in need of help the tip was for $ 1,075 - representing a tithe the family would have normally given to their church			1
while the couple wish to stay anonymous , they told @entity22 they had recently moved to @entity4 from @entity16 and had not decided where to send their tithe money			1
they had recently received a work bonus and , after being impressed with @entity19 's service , decided their donation this month should go to her			1
the note they left @entity19 partially explained the decision , saying : ' @entity117 us and we were led to give it to you			1
@entity121 ! ' what makes the story all the more surprising is that the family were completely unaware of @entity19 's circumstances and just how much they have helped her			1
' i just want to thank them , ' she said			0
' thank them so much , because i 'm humbled			0
i do believe that @entity24 led you to me at this time in my life ' i hope and pray that someday i 'm able to do this for somebody			0
and at the first opportunity i will do it			0

@entity0 left for work at @entity3 's cafe - restaurant in @entity4 , @entity5 , on wednesday with a disconnection notice on her door
she had fallen behind in her bills after giving up work to travel to @entity16 and be with her mother , who had suffered a heart attack
when a nice family - of - three left their check turned upside down @entity19 expected they had left a bad tip or a note about poor service
they had left a tip of over $ 1000 and a brief note explaining why
