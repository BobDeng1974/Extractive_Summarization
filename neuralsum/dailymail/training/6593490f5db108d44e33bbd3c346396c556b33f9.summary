body image issues are the bane of women 's lives : we worry about our weight , our skin , our hair - and about the appearance of our vaginas , according to statistics on the growing popularity of labiaplasty			2
in the past decade , cases of genital cosmetic surgery have risen five-fold , with more than 2,000 women now having the procedure on the @entity17 each year			2
but not everyone wants to go under the knife in their quest for the perfect ' designer vagina ' - so now , new non-surgical techniques are launching which promise the results of labiaplasty without the pain and recovery time			2
@entity28 , pictured with her husband @entity29 and baby boy @entity30 , says she feels like she has her body back @entity28 had a difficult experience during labour with her son ( pictured ) and needed extensive stitches after the birth business development manager @entity37 , 41 , was unhappy with the appearance of her vagina , so tried out one new non-surgical procedure which claims to remodel labia left stretched by the trauma of childbirth using a combination of radio frequencies and ultrasound			1
@entity28 had a difficult experience during labour with her son and needed extensive stitches after the birth , which left her scarred , affecting both her confidence and sex life			1
as a result , @entity28 felt insecure and inhibited in the bedroom with husband @entity29			1
' i 'd had a fairly uneventful pregnancy with my son @entity30 , with the labour itself even being pretty low - key			2
' it was n't until the birth itself that the problems started - my son 's head got stuck and i ended up having to have a ventouse [ forceps ] delivery			2
' unfortunately the suction device did n't work , and i was given an episiotomy as a last resort , leaving me with over 50 stitches and in a lot of pain			1
' ' due to the cuts administered when giving birth , my inner and outer labia were a mess			0
i 'd expected everything to heal and go back to normal , but i was left with an untidy looking area that made me feel self - conscious			0
' my confidence , which prior to pregnancy had been high , vanished , and our sex life started to suffer			1
' @entity28 became aware of a new technology , which is due to be unveiled to the medical community this october and is a non-invasive option to the surgical intervention known as labiaplasty , which can cost over £ 3,000 and involves recovery time			2
this new technique remodels labia left stretched by the trauma of childbirth using a combination of radio frequencies and ultrasound			1
the @entity95 and @entity96 - approved technique gives results in just four sessions , and has been shown in clinical studies to also increase sexual libido			0
@entity28 says she now has renewed confidence in herself , and with husband @entity29 ( left ) radio frequency skin tightening is not a new technique , but this is the first time that it has been used for the purposes of labia remodelling			1
the treatment takes just 12 minutes , during which a water - based gel is applied to the skin , and the device , which emits an electrical current , is applied to the skin of the labia			1
this current encourages the production of new collagen and elastin , which tightens the skin and enhances the appearance of the labia			1
although a side effect of the application of radio frequencies and ultrasound is heat , it is not uncomfortable			1
' i was dubious when she told me it was both painless and fast - acting , so i was honestly gobsmacked when i started to see results after just one treatment			0
@entity28 , here with baby @entity30 and husband @entity29 , underwent a new non-invasive procedure to reverse the damage that childbirth had done , seeing results quickly , as well as an increased libido ' i feel like i have my body back and my husband has his wife back , ' @entity28 says triumphantly			1
' our sex life has improved ten-fold which i think is not only due to improved appearance and sensitivity down there , but also the renewed confidence it 's given me			1
' i 've honestly never felt sexier and my libido is higher than ever			0
' gynaecology and aesthetics nurse , @entity150 of @entity153 , @entity154 , where @entity28 had her procedure - says : ' many women experience changes in their genitals that result in hypertrophy – an increase in volume – of the labia minora , either during puberty or later in life , perhaps following childbirth			1
' this can result in psychological suffering as they feel they look abnormal , or they may experience physical discomfort during activities such as cycling or horse riding			0
' previously , invasive surgery was the only option , which can be painful and takes weeks to heal			0
intima is a world - first , and we can now offer a simple solution , with minimal pain and no recovery time			0
' @entity183 , director of the @entity184 , a specialist in this field and @entity188 spokesperson , says : ' there is no doubt that labiaplasty surgery is on the rise ' suitable patients may derive significant physical and psychological benefits and i have personally seen huge patient satisfaction in my practice			0
however , it is a delicate procedure and it is imperative that patients are counselled properly and have access to a psychologist if required			2
' the primary concern for most girls is stretching or enlargement of the labia and the best way to approach this problem is surgery			0
furthermore , careful assessment of the anatomical variations is essential to implement a tailor - made plan			0
' radio frequency is excellent technology but it has its limitations and while this new machine seems attractive and may derive some benefit in a small minority , it is unlikely to address the majority of patient 's concerns			0
i would be interested to see long - term results			0
' i would definitely recommend patients contemplating labiaplasty procedures seek the help of an experienced plastic surgeon who specialises in this area ' @entity177 will be available at the exclusive @entity229 clinic in @entity154 in @entity230 , and will be presented at the @entity231 and @entity232 in @entity233 this october			0
