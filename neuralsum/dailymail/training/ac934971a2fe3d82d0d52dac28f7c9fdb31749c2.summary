the news of @entity2 's injury has worsened @entity4 's injury crisis in midfield as they push for silverware this season			1
the @entity8 international has been ruled out until the start of next year with a knee injury , joining fellow midfielders @entity11 and @entity13 on the treatment table			1
with the @entity17 ' injury crisis mounting we asked @entity4 fan site @entity18 who @entity20 should sign in january to add depth and quality to the @entity26 holders ' midfield			1
@entity4 's depleted midfield is in desperate need of a new addition following the news that @entity2 has been ruled out until early 2015			1
huge amounts of pressure have been heaped on the likes of @entity34 , a player who himself has found himself on the treatment table for over 20 months in the last three years			2
fellow midfield stars @entity37 and @entity38 will also need to manage their own injury problems and maintain a level of consistency if the club are to mount a genuine challenge for trophies this season			1
but who will be @entity4 's missing piece in the jigsaw when the january transfer window reopens ? @entity50 's pass master @entity51 is the man @entity20 should sign			1
he was the subject of a Â£ 12million bid from @entity4 the summer before he moved to the @entity77 from @entity61 in january			2
the @entity79 international admitted his frustration earlier in the week at not being given regular game time by boss @entity82			0
' am i completely happy ? to be honest , no. ' , admitted @entity51			0
' it is a new situation for me , but i do n't complain			0
it is the first time i have n't played regularly for my club			0
@entity4 's record - signing @entity2 has been ruled out injured until early 2015 the @entity8 international ( left ) has a partial lateral collateral ligament tear in his left knee @entity34 ( bottom left ) has been blighted with injury problems since breaking through at @entity4 ' do i sometimes miss @entity92 ? yes			1
sometimes i think about it , but i immediately sweep that away because it would cause distraction			0
' @entity20 is a known admirer of @entity51 's abilities and there are several reasons why he should consider launching a loan bid for the midfielder in january			2
@entity51 is a versatile , deep - lying playmaker able to orchestrate attacks from deep positions and he would be perfect player to breach opposition defences while the injured @entity2 is on the sidelines			2
a potential loan deal would suit both clubs down to the ground and with @entity51 being cup tied in the @entity112 , all of his focus would be on the @entity113 , where he played 79 times in two - and - a - half seasons for @entity61			0
@entity51 ( right ) has admitted his frustration at being overlooked for a starting place in the @entity50 first team @entity51 ( right ) has @entity113 experience already after a successful two - and - a - half years at @entity61 the 28 - year - old made 79 appearances for the @entity121 where his displays made him a fan favourite when @entity4 played @entity61 at @entity125 ' last season , @entity51 was one of the best players on the pitch , posing problems for the @entity17 ' defence with his accurate set - pieces and long - range efforts towards goal			1
and @entity20 's side , who have scored just 14 times in four seasons from corners , need a player like @entity51 who can deliver pin - point passes , break up play and spread the play for forwards @entity142 and @entity144			0
@entity51 , who racked up two assists and six goals for @entity61 in his final six months at @entity147 , would provide much - needed tenacity , creativity and experience in an injury - plagued squad which is in desperate need of quality players			0

@entity4 should sign @entity50 midfielder @entity51 in january
@entity51 would help solve @entity4 's midfield problems
@entity79 midfielder is frustrated at lack of playing *opportunities*
@entity2 has been ruled out until early 2015 with a knee injury
likes of @entity38 and @entity34 have been blighted with injuries
