cheat : @entity0 , 33 , from @entity1 , who used illegally claimed benefits as a ' financial security net ' while enjoying foreign holidays and a lavish lifestyle a mother - of - three who used illegally - claimed benefits as a ' financial safety net ' while enjoying foreign holidays and lavish spending on her home was receiving thousands from her well - paid boyfriend , a court heard			1
@entity0 told officials she lived alone with her three children and raked in income support , housing benefit and council tax relief , a court heard			1
but in reality , she was sharing her @entity1 home with boyfriend @entity23 - a former soldier working in private security in the @entity25			1
in one year , he was able to deposit £ 9,000 into his 33 - year - old girlfriend 's account - all the while claiming benefits , using them as a ' financial safety net '			1
it also enabled her to pay for family holidays to @entity32 and @entity33 , as well as a £ 1,000 - plus sofa , fridge , washing machine , flooring and a @entity39 subscription			0
her deception was discovered in 2013 , although she initially denied being in a relationship with mr @entity23			1
however , her neighbours knew they were a couple , and @entity44 heard mr @entity23 also had his car registered at the @entity1 property , and his pension correspondence from the army went there			0
eventually , @entity0 admitted two charges of failing to notify a change in circumstances , and yesterday she was given a two - month suspended prison sentence			2
the judge , @entity55 , @entity56 , described her dishonesty as ' blatant ' and also ordered @entity0 , of @entity58 , to pay £ 400 costs			0
@entity60 , mitigating , told the court that the fathers of @entity0 's first two children ' contributed very little to their upbringing '			2

@entity0 claimed she was a single mother in order to claim benefits
but @entity0 was actually in a relationship with former soldier @entity23
the private security worker was depositing thousands into her account
so mother - of - three used benefits as a ' safety net ' while spending lavishly
defence say is ' understandable ' *due* to lack of child support from fathers
