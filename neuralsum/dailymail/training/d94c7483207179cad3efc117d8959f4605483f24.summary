a @entity1 dog breed which was rarer than the giant panda has been saved from extinction following a concerted effort by breeders			2
there were only 52 @entity8 spaniels registered with the @entity9 in 2011 , compared with 50,000 labradors			1
and there are believed to be up to 2,000 giant pandas living in the wild and more than 250 in captivity			0
numbers of the dogs - first bred in @entity17 in the 1800s for hunting - have been fragile since , dropping to only seven after the @entity20			1
but now the @entity8 has increased by 29 per cent to 74 registrations to meet demand for the compact dogs			1
@entity24 takes off in wintery weather - sussex spaniels are very active dogs @entity27 plays in the garden with @entity8 puppies bred by her granny the sussex spaniel breed has hazel eyes , a liver - coloured nose and a frowning brow they are expected to hit three figures this year , after a group of breeders clubbed together to save the spaniels			1
it is hoped last year 's births will help the population into a sustainable future as they become old enough to be used for breeding			0
@entity45 , secretary of the @entity46 , said : ' it is a small breed so most of us know each other and we all love and care about our dogs			2
' in 2011 , a group of people who knew the breed just all together decided to have a litter in 2012			1
' there were eight litters in the first quarter of 2012 , six in the second and two in the third			2
it is not that many litters compared to other breeds , but it is progress			0
@entity66 of @entity67 ( left ) , a fine example of he breed , was born 1930 and owned by @entity70			2
show champion @entity71 ( right ) was born in 1976 @entity73 with his working dogs at the @entity75 , where he took part in the parade @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 all belong to @entity45 , secretary of the @entity46 these @entity8 spaniels are drawing breath among the bluebells ' the population of @entity8 spaniels has been struggling since the @entity20 , for some reason - we 're not sure why			1
' they do n't seem to be very popular and they are not easy dogs to breed			2
people tend to go for cocker spaniels or @entity94 springers instead			2
' we are doing more and more to spread the word about them and it seems to be working			0
there were quite a few people waiting for puppies so the demand was there			0
' the @entity8 spaniel is believed to have been founded by @entity104 in the 1800s in @entity106 , @entity8			1
the breed was identified by the @entity9 in 2004 as a vulnerable @entity1 breed			1
the @entity46 was formed in 1924 for the ' protection of the @entity8 '			1
the association has 220 members			0
the @entity8 spaniel is a happy healthy dog			1
he makes a good gun dog , a show dog , or a pet and is very adaptable			0
it is a guarding breed and the dogs are quite possessive of their owners			2
they are fine with people and children but they need plenty of socialisation , puppy classes , obedience classes , time and patience			0
they live happily with other dogs , though they are usually top dog ! he bred the dogs to work on his large estate until the 1850s , when he died			0
other breeders took up @entity8 spaniels and the population remained healthy but small until the @entity20 , when many stopped their breeding programme due to rationing			1
only seven @entity8 spaniels are known to have survived the war , living with animal - lover @entity145 , who devoted her life to keeping the breed going			1
the population has remained fragile ever since , with @entity46 members attempting to maintain the breed			2
mrs @entity45 , who is based in @entity151 , @entity152 , added : ' i do n't know why they are not popular because they are lovely dogs			0
' they are happy and healthy and are very adaptable			0
" they 're lovely dogs but can be a bit bossy			0
i often get that look which says " this is my sofa "			0
' i would certainly recommend them as a loyal and loving pet			0
' she said the rich golden - coloured dogs , which cost around £ 800 each , have a unique look , being smaller , lower and more compact than some other spaniels			1
' they especially enjoy being around people			0
' a slightly different version of the breed is popular in @entity170			2
new playmates : @entity172 and @entity173 with a litter of @entity8 puppies owned by @entity45 @entity176 , @entity9 secretary , said : ' everybody is talking about the post-olympic baby boom but perhaps the celebration of our @entity1 heritage in 2012 has helped lead to a revival of some of our native breeds			1
as a result of farming , deforestation and other development , the giant panda has been driven out of lowland areas in @entity192 ' fashion and profile have the most influential impact on dog choice and we are pleased to see there is still a place in people ’s hearts and homes for our @entity1 vulnerable breeds			0
' many are still at risk but there has been significant improvement in some breeds			0
' it is great to see responsible breeders rallying together to support the breed they love			0
@entity9 registrations for the @entity8 have increased by 29 per cent since 2011 largely thanks to these dedicated breeders , who are helping the @entity9 to raise awareness about the breed amongst people who might not previously have heard of its existence			1
' we would thoroughly recommend anyone thinking about buying a pedigree dog to consider the @entity8 , a wonderfully charming breed , and would suggest visiting the @entity222 area of this year ’s @entity223 , in @entity224 from the 7th to the 10th of march , to meet the breed and to chat to current owners about the many fantastic qualities these dogs possess			1
' people need to make sure that any dog that they choose is a good fit for their lifestyle but we hope that by highlighting these lesser known breeds people will do their research thoroughly before they buy to see if these dogs might be for them			0
' other breeds that have significantly increased in popularity include the @entity94 toy terrier ( black and tan ) which has seen a 25 per cent increase to 126 puppy registrations and the @entity244 water spaniel which has gone up by 32 per cent to 148 registrations			1
historic shot : from left , mrs @entity249 's @entity248 of @entity250 , @entity251 of @entity250 , @entity252 and @entity253 the @entity247 the @entity94 setter has come off the @entity9 ’s list of native dog breeds that could be at risk of extinction after registrations increased by 25 per cent in 2012			1
however , the significant decline of the smooth fox terrier by 46 per cent to 94 registrations and of the @entity264 by 56 per cent to 151 puppy registrations , means that the overall number of dogs within the 35 breeds on the vulnerable and @entity269 lists has increased by 1 per cent			0
