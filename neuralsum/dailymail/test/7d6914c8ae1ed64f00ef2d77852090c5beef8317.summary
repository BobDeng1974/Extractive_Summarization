@entity0 welcome @entity1 on saturday tea - time with the stakes sky - high for the @entity4 rivals			1
for @entity7 ’s men it is about seeing home a title bid which , in recent matches , has had to rely on one or two last - gasp interventions			2
@entity12 's @entity1 , meanwhile , have hit top gear and it appears that all roads lead to the @entity15			1
here , @entity16 asks 10 key questions ahead of this weekend ’s big match … @entity4 leaders @entity0 host a resurgent @entity1 in the @entity4 on saturday @entity22 veteran @entity21 celebrates after handing @entity0 the lead at @entity24 in their previous clash @entity26 rescued a draw with an injury time equaliser in the game in october 2014 will @entity31 get a look in ? @entity1 have won four on the spin in which @entity34 has not started			1
the last time he did , @entity1 were beaten by @entity36 in the @entity37 and @entity34 was sent off			2
indeed , the £ 60m winger has scored just once since october – and that against @entity40 who have since been relegated			0
if it ai n’t broke , do n’t fix it - and that means @entity34 is almost certain to miss out again this weekend			0
@entity31 is likely to start another game on the bench after losing his first team place the @entity48 international 's form has slumped since making a bright start to his @entity4 career sports analysts @entity51 predict that a @entity0 win is easily the most likely outcome at @entity54 will @entity55 make @entity0 pay ? keeping @entity34 out of the side is @entity55 , and deservedly so			1
his match - winning brace at @entity59 was a real watershed moment for @entity61 and this @entity1 vintage			2
sold by @entity0 for £ 37.1m last january , their judgement looked shrewd as he struggled to impact under @entity65			2
but @entity61 is getting the best from the cunning @entity67 and he will need little motivating ahead of the reunion with @entity7 , the man who deemed him not good enough for @entity54			2
@entity55 has been an integral part of @entity1 's rise since scoring a sensational brace against @entity59 the @entity73 international could return to haunt his former club after being pushed out at @entity54 ( left ) will a @entity1 victory blow open the title race ? yes			1
it would leave @entity0 seven points clear of @entity36 – having both played 32 - with a trip to the @entity82 on the horizon			1
and , with the @entity84 showing no sign of letting up , were the @entity22 to lose that @entity88 derby then it would make for a nervy final few rounds of the campaign , especially as @entity0 still have to face in - form @entity92 and @entity59 , as well as a tricky trip to resurgent @entity94			0
but perhaps @entity1 – who would be five points behind having played a game more were they to win – represent the biggest danger to @entity0 ’s crown			1
@entity0 will be hoping to open up a greater gap before they head to the @entity82 for a clash with @entity36 will the @entity102 again be spectators ? @entity102 comrades @entity103 and @entity105 have found themselves warming the bench for the large part and they ’ll be able to catch up on the touchline again on saturday night			2
@entity109 – @entity0 ’s £ 23m january signing – has managed just three hours of top - flight football and has failed to score or create a goal in that time			2
@entity113 , meanwhile , will be ditched at the end of the season after a return of just four goals			0
not all @entity102 are as good as @entity119 it would appear … @entity103 's ( right ) role at @entity1 has been reduced to that of substitute both @entity102 have failed to live up to expectations following big money deals to sign them will @entity7 meet his match in @entity126 ? @entity7 has long since ruled the roost in the @entity4 , rival after rival lining up to lay praise at the feet of the @entity132			1
do n’t expect @entity61 to extol the virtues of his opposite number , however			0
there ’s only one @entity132 is @entity126 ’s world			0
he is fast going about proving as much at @entity24 and victory for @entity61 in west @entity88 would not rest easy with the proud @entity139			0
@entity12 ( left ) and @entity7 will see two of the biggest egos in football collide on saturday @entity7 and @entity61 embrace after their first meeting in october , will there be smiles again ? will @entity147 remind @entity0 what they missed out on in 2013 ? it was during the summer of 2013 that @entity7 attempted to lure @entity1 ’s star to @entity54 – and boy did he come close			1
had he achieved as much then @entity0 would have been defending their title this season rather than trying to reclaim it			0
@entity147 remains a class act , as 21 goals for club and country this term bear testimony to			0
@entity7 holds @entity1 ’s skipper in the highest regard and must still regret not seeing home a transfer which had looked very much on the cards			1
@entity147 came close to signing for @entity0 in 2013 before being convinced to stay by @entity65 the @entity165 captain has been the inspiration behind @entity1 's six - game winning run will @entity169 remind @entity1 what they missed out on in 2014 ? it was a no - brainer , was n’t it ? with @entity175 desperate for a return to @entity165 and @entity1 in desperate need of guile in the middle of the park , surely they would pull out all of the stops to bring @entity169 to @entity24 ? instead , he went to @entity0 and has been inspirational as the @entity22 have eased to within touching distance of the title			1
his goals return – three in the league – has been poor , but there is no under - estimating is worth to the team in terms of craft and graft			0
@entity169 and @entity192 would have made some pairing			0
@entity169 has been clocking up the assists at @entity0 after being snubbed by @entity1 last summer the @entity67 would have formed a formidable midfield partnership with @entity192 at @entity24 can @entity0 cope without @entity196 ? the @entity67 ’s form had stuttered before his injury , with just three goals in 10			1
but his presence is perhaps the key reason behind @entity0 ’s title charge this season			0
it is no coincidence that it was n’t until the 88th minute that they registered an effort on target at @entity208 last weekend			0
@entity21 is far from the force he once was and @entity1 ’s defence will be grateful that @entity196 is not in opposition			1
@entity196 is escorted off the field against @entity213 and has been ruled out of the match on saturday the @entity73 international was on fire at the start of the season but has tailed off in recent months who will come out on top in the @entity222 nominees – @entity223 or @entity224 ? hazard , it seems , is a shoo - in for the prestigious prize , and with good reason			1
but @entity228 could well be joining him on the podium given his improvement this season			0
@entity223 ( right ) has arguably been the @entity22 most influential player in the title chase hazard is competing with @entity235 1 @entity224 for the @entity222 award the @entity1 custodian has kept 13 clean sheets and , having matured into the goalkeeper sir @entity240 always thought he would do , it is little surprise @entity242 are courting @entity73 ’s @entity244			1
were @entity0 to get a penalty – pitching @entity223 against @entity228 – it would certainly prove a fascinating duel			1
finally , are @entity0 as good as champions if they win ? yes			0
ten points clear with six to play would mean they could afford to lose half of those games and still be crowned champions			2
perhaps that is why the neutral will be in the red corner this weekend .			0
