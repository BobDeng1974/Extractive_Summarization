the temperature is a balmy 25c ; pulling my sunglasses over my eyes , i warm my face in the bright sunshine before taking a sip of sangria			0
@entity9 , @entity8 - the perfect destination for a summer break			1
except this is october and i 'm not here to put my feet up			0
i 'm on a mission to buy a new winter wardrobe and i 've got another shop to visit			1
going abroad for a little retail therapy is n't something i 've ever done before			0
i have a couple of glamorous friends who occasionally jet off to @entity23 to stock up on the latest designer labels , but my budget has never stretched further than my local @entity26			0
bagging a bargain : @entity28 travelled to @entity29 to see if she could save money on her winter wardrobe never mind the purchases you make when you get there , you have to factor in paying for flights and a hotel			1
not to mention getting to and from the airport , travelling around the city , and eating			0
but i 've discovered that several clothing brands are much cheaper in @entity29 than in the @entity40			1
@entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 cost up to 39 per cent less in @entity29 than here at home			1
not surprisingly , they are all @entity29 brands			1
items are either manufactured in @entity29 or , if they 're made further afield , channelled through @entity29 distribution centres			1
if they do n't have to travel on far then it 's going to bring costs down			1
the exchange rate is also relatively advantageous and taxes tend to be lower			0
but how much cheaper does this make it ? i decided to see if i could buy a whole winter wardrobe - and pay for a return flight and a night in a hotel in @entity8 - for no more than the cost of buying exactly the same clothes in the @entity40			1
i chose 13 key items - a work dress , party frock , trousers , skirt , winter coat , smart jacket , shirt , casual top , ankle boots , pair of smart heels , jumper , leather gloves and scarf			2
so can it be done ? booking my flight five days before my trip , i discover i can fly @entity79 from my local airport , @entity81 , to @entity8 ’s main airport for £ 93.98			1
feeling quite pleased with myself , i turn my attention to a hotel			2
a frantic afternoon scrolling through myriad price comparison websites results in a booking at the @entity87 for £ 47			0
it 's a four - star hotel , so i ’m pleased with my bargain			2
with the basics in place , off i set on an 8.20 am flight			2
travelling with hand luggage only , i pack the bare essentials , so my bag is left virtually empty for my new purchases			0
luckily , while gloomy @entity40 is being drenched with rain , @entity8 is having an autumnal heatwave , so there ’s no need to pack a coat			1
worth the trip : it 's far cheaper to shop at @entity41 and @entity43 in @entity29 the exchange rate on the day i travel means one euro equals roughly 79p - or £ 1 = € 1.26			1
a bus from the airport to the city centre costs € 5.90 ( £ 4.67 ) and once i 'm there , a two - day travelcard to get me round the @entity110 costs € 14.40 ( £ 11.40 )			2
so far i 've spent £ 158 - and that 's without buying anything to eat			2
can i cover it all in savings at the shops ? after dumping my bag in my hotel room , i head to the main shopping street off the @entity119 , @entity8 ’s main square			1
my first destination is @entity41 - owned , like @entity42 , by @entity29 retail giant @entity121			1
one of the @entity40 's favourite stores , it 's favoured by stylish women including the @entity125 , who chose a floaty blue @entity41 dress the day after her wedding in 2011			1
here , i spot the perfect work dress - a dog - tooth - pattern shift with forgiving elbow - length sleeves			0
figure - hugging but smart , it costs € 39.95 ( £ 31.63 )			2
in the @entity40 , this dress would have set me back £ 49.99 , so that ’s a saving of £ 18.36 to start with			1
then i spy a navy blazer with a single brass button that will go with everything and is so classically chic , it ’s surely one the @entity125 would have her eye on if she was n't expecting			0
this is € 69.95 ( £ 55.38 ) , but in the @entity40 is priced at £ 79.99 , saving me £ 24.61			1
@entity139 fan : @entity140 of @entity141 has worn @entity41 clothes on numerous occasions , including the day after she married prince @entity144 when she wore this blue dress at @entity146 now i 'm on a roll			1
i spot a soft camel coat for € 79.95 ( £ 63.30 ) that would be £ 89.99 at home , saving me more than £ 25 , a pair of comfy leather ankle boots for € 69.95 ( £ 55.38 ) that are £ 69.99 in the @entity40 and a stripy top for € 12.95 ( £ 10.25 )			1
unfortunately , a pair of silver kitten heels i 'd coveted at home were sold out and the store is generally lacking in glam shoes , but a pink - and - black party dress with jewel embellishments is there for € 49.95 ( £ 39.52 ) , a saving of about £ 20 on buying it in @entity40 , where it would cost £ 59.99			1
while gloves are the last thing i need in sunny @entity8 , i try to remember i am putting together a ' winter ' wardrobe			1
i imagine doing the school run on an icy december morning and pick up a pair of black leather gloves for € 29.95 ( £ 23.70 )			0
these are £ 29.99 in the @entity40			2
my next stop is @entity43			2
i 've always thought of @entity43 as a store for the under - 30s			2
however , i 'm surprised to find a red jumper with pretty detailing			0
it 's viscose and polyester , but at € 19.99 ( £ 15.82 ) is such a bargain it wo n’t matter if it does n’t last			0
it ’s less of a bargain back at home , though , where it costs £ 24.99			0
while many of the skirts in @entity43 are too thigh - skimming for my liking , i find a knee - length black and navy pencil skirt for € 29.99 ( £ 23.75 ) , which looks great with the sweater			1
on the @entity40 @entity26 , it would cost £ 34.99			1
sadly , there are no party shoes here either , but i find a cosy tartan scarf for € 19.99 ( £ 15.82 )			0
@entity40 price ? £ 24.99			2
as i 'm about to pay for my items , i spot a display of sunglasses			0
they 're not on my winter shopping list , but as one of the arms fell off my own pair on the flight over - and the sun is very bright - i treat myself to a pair of tortoiseshell specs			2
at € 19.99 ( £ 15.82 ) , they 're nearly a tenner less than in the @entity40 , where they ’re £ 24.99			2
by this point i ’m too exhausted to shop any more and treat myself to a bowl of gazpacho soup , a roll and a small jug of sangria in a beautiful square off @entity221 - @entity8 ’s tree - lined promenade			2
the cost is an eye - watering € 17 ( £ 13.45 ) , but then i am in prime tourist territory			0
pays to shop in @entity29 : items in @entity41 can be 39 per cent less than they are in the @entity40 after returning to my hotel to recharge my batteries , i spend the evening exploring in the vibrant squares of the @entity231 area 15 minutes ’ walk from my hotel			1
dinner is tapas - what else ? - and a beer for € 25 ( £ 19.79 ) before heading to bed for an early night			0
as i 've still got three items on my list to find , i ’m in the hotel having cafe con leche and a croissant by 8.30 am , despite that breakfast is € 8 ( £ 6.33 ) extra			2
then it ’s back on the @entity110 and once more to the shops			0
@entity42 , which has 11 stores around the @entity40 , is @entity41 ’s older , more upmarket sister			1
but there are big savings to be made here , too			0
a classic white stretch shirt with black piping detail will look great with the pencil skirt			0
in @entity8 it costs me € 49.95 ( £ 39.53 ) , but in the @entity40 is £ 54.95			1
meanwhile , a pair of dark red trousers are also € 49.95 ( £ 39.53 ) but would cost £ 54.95 at home			0
and i find a pair of shoes that will be perfect for work and @entity262 parties			0
the crocodile - skin - effect slingbacks are € 89.95 ( £ 71.17 ) - my most expensive purchase - but would have cost £ 89.99 at home			0
finally , i have everything - all 13 items , plus some bonus sunglasses			0
it 's time to head back to the airport for my 2.35pm flight			0
of course , to avoid paying for check - in baggage i have to wear as much as possible			0
piling on my blazer and coat when the temperature is 25c leaves me hot and red - faced			0
at least , because i 've been shopping in the @entity277 i do n't have to pay import duty			0
so did i manage to save enough on my shopping to cover the cost of my mini-break ? when i tot everything up i discover - hurrah ! - i am £ 3.89 in credit ! @entity284 , sea and savings ? it pays to shop in @entity29			1
winter wardrobe sorted : @entity28 saved £ 205 on clothes			1

several clothing brands are much cheaper in @entity29 than in the @entity40
@entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 cost up to 39 per cent less
but with travel costs , how much cheaper does this make it ?
@entity298 flew to @entity8 to find out
*challenge* involved buying winter wardrobe , return flight and night in a hotel
but spending no more than the cost of buying exactly same clothes in @entity40
