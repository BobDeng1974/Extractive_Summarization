exam standards have dropped because boards are competing to offer the easiest papers , a damning year - long inquiry has found			1
an influential committee of @entity5 concluded that the current system allows boards to ' strip out ' content from gcses and a-levels so they can boast to schools that their exams are ' more accessible '			1
the public has been forced to endure years of denials that grade inflation exists even though they can see it ' with their own eyes ' , they said			0
testing times : exam standards have dropped because boards are competing to offer the easiest papers , a damning year - long inquiry has found the verdict is a vindication for education secretary @entity25 , who has demanded curbs on competition between exam boards to stamp out grade inflation			1
at present , up to six boards set exams in each subject and schools choose which one they wish to use			1
in an attempt to tackle a culture of ' competitive dumbing - down ' , mr @entity25 is proposing to allow only one board to design an exam in each subject			1
the @entity40 today backed the thrust of the reforms but suggested instead devising a single national syllabus for each subject and allowing boards to set question papers against it			1
this would remove incentives to dumb down courses and ' race to the bottom ' while still allowing the benefits of competition , it was @entity57 chairman @entity56 said a system of single national syllabuses would prevent exam boards ' making out their syllabus is more accessible than someone else 's '			1
in the firing line.jpg he added : ' it would get rid of the perverse incentive to strip out content from a syllabus , to strip out the richness of learning from a course in order to make the course supposedly more accessible , in truth to make it easier			1
' he highlighted embarrassing undercover filming last year which showed a senior geography examiner for the @entity77 board telling a reporter , posing as a teacher , that ' you do n't have to teach a lot ' and there was ' a lot less ' for pupils to learn than with rival exam boards			1
@entity86 admitted she did not know ' how we got it through ' the official regulation system that is supposed to ensure high standards			2
mr @entity56 said : ' we conclude that competition between exam boards creates significant pressure to drive down standards in exams , and that the time is right for fundamental reform			2
' we have got to stop the dumbing down of the courses young people sit and stop exam boards competing on how accessible their syllabuses are			2
' there has been grade inflation			0
there has been a denial it 's going on while the public can see with their own eyes that it 's happening			0
' if you have people denying obvious truths they see in their own lives they will lose confidence in those who are vouching for that system			2
' last month , the @entity119 revealed that mr @entity25 was planning to scrap dumbed - down gcses and bring back rigorous o - levels			2
leaked documents showed he has drawn up a blueprint which would tear up the current exam system as well as abolishing the @entity125			1
evidence : the news is a vindication for education secretary @entity25 @entity25 warned yesterday that hundreds of thousands of teenagers were being steered towards dubious vocational courses ' which do not benefit them '			1
the @entity25 spoke out as he unveiled funding reforms aimed at spelling the end of pointless courses and getting many more 16 - year - olds to train to be plumbers , chefs and electricians			0
the overhaul of school and college funding for 16 to 19 - year - olds is expected to lead to the decline of courses such as the @entity146 in introduction to @entity148 , nicknamed the course in becoming a ' trolley dolly '			0
the @entity152 course , which is taken by around 2,300 a year , involves 150 hours of teaching , but it does not ' require or prove occupational competence ' and fails to meet airline requirements			0
schools and colleges will also be encouraged to offer ' substantial ' vocational qualifications , which are recognised by employers			0
these might include a @entity161 in @entity162 , which takes two years and includes plenty of practical work or a btec in @entity166 , which also combines theory with practical training			0
the @entity169 reported that the number of pupils taking courses in construction trades had halved in a year , between 2008/09 and 2009/10			0
yet a third of vacancies for tradesmen such as plumbers and electricians had been attributed to shortages of workers with these skills			0
the shake - up follows a devastating review of vocational qualifications by professor @entity185 , of @entity186 , which condemned many as ' dead - end '			0
mr @entity25 said : ' around 1.6million 16 to 19 - year - olds are in education each year , but as professor @entity191 stated in her review , as many as 350,000 are on courses which do not benefit them			2
' the education secretary is not withdrawing the lesser - quality courses but he is removing cash incentives for schools and colleges to offer them			1
this could lead to the institutions withdrawing the @entity211 addition , for the first time , teenagers who fail to achieve a c in gcse @entity205 and maths will be required to continue studying the subjects until the age of 18			0
the move is designed to answer concerns from employers who complain that school - leavers too often lack mastery of basic skills .			0
