settling down to a glass of wine and a naughty snack is the ultimate after work treat for many of us			1
but which tipple is the best to bring out the flavour in fiery wasabi peas or salty sausage rolls ? wine experts have created a guide to matching wine with snacks that recommends pairing @entity15 with nachos and @entity18 with salt and vinegar crisps			2
a riesling is the perfect companion to a sausage roll , @entity21 goes great with wasabi peas or pittas and hummus , and @entity28 is the best glass to compliment a box of chocolates			1
tasters at @entity32 sampled different types of wine with 10 of the nation 's most popular snacks and light bites			0
they even found that different wines match different pizza toppings - with @entity42 best for a margherita but a meaty @entity44 with a pepperoni			1
meanwhile , @entity46 was found to be the perfect pairing for salted popcorn and a @entity49 goes down a treat with a drop of @entity52			1
tv cook and author , @entity55 , who took part in the tasting session with @entity32 wine maker @entity58 , said : ' there are plenty of guidelines out there about the best wines to drink with main meals but there is n't really any inspiration for which wines to enjoy with smaller plates or snacks			0
' so it 's brilliant to know you can now enjoy a delicious wine that perfectly complements the flavours of whatever you 're eating			2
' whether that 's a sunday roast with all the family , or a well - deserved treat just for you , and wasabi peas and @entity21 was a real eye opener			0
' in order to decide on the perfect pairings , 11 types of wine were tried with each of the different foods , with @entity55 and @entity58 smelling and tasting the food and the drink before pairing them up from a total of 110 possible combinations			0
the next time you order a cheese and tomato pizza , opt for a spicy @entity42 as its spicy fruit flavours can stand up to the strong aromatic herbs , tangy tomato sauce and salty cheese they found sausage rolls are paired perfectly with the @entity22 due to the ' buttery pastry and rich pork balancing the lime and green apple flavours of the wine '			1
for pizza , the toppings make a difference to the choice of wine , with a @entity112 matched with @entity42 , thanks to its ' spicy fruit flavours standing up well ' to the herbs , tomato sauce and cheese topping			1
but if you opt for a pepperoni pizza , you should serve it with a @entity44 thanks to the ' meaty wine going great with the aniseed kick of the pepperoni '			1
@entity21 works with wasabi peas due to the ' creaminess of the wine taking the heat out of the horseradish ' with toasted pittas and hummus going nicely with the same wine because of the ' peach and melon notes complimenting the nutty flavours of the chickpeas '			2
for scotch eggs , a @entity52 complimented the flavours well and for salt and vinegar crisps , a @entity135 was found to be the best match			1
experts at the @entity143 winery put together the new wine matching guide after a survey of 2,000 adults revealed 57 per cent are regularly replacing evening weekday meals with snacks , such as pizza , nachos and pittas and dips			2
and more than half said they would like to know more about the wines that go with the foods they regularly eat			0
seventy - one per cent also admitted they felt there is too much snobbery associated with wine selection			0
@entity162 's @entity161 ' @entity58 added : ' whatever the dish you 're cooking , wherever you are in the world , it 's not hard to find a recommendation for the best wine to pair it with			2
' we 're passionate about making quality wines that are great for sharing with good friends and family , and we wanted to celebrate those authentic moments when people are together enjoying a glass of wine with a snack as well			2
' this guide helps people make the most of that time , with a glass of wine that tastes amazing with their favourite treat			0
' @entity184 told us they wanted to know about the best wines to go with snacks like wasabi peas , popcorn and chocolate as well as old favourites like pizza			1
' and , this new take on wine pairings is the perfect solution			0
' @entity112 wine match : @entity42 why it works : spicy fruit flavours with plum and pepper can stand up to the strong aromatic herbs , tangy tomato sauce and salty cheese that makes a perfect @entity112 pizza @entity204 wine match : @entity44 why it works : the cabernet sauvignon , rich in blackcurrent and plum , is a meaty wine great with the aniseed spice kick of the pepperoni			1
the hint of oak provides a dryness that helps balance out the richness of the cheese and oil from the sausage			0
@entity220 wine match : @entity22 why it works : the butteriness in the pastry and the richness of the pork is great with the slight acid from lime and green apple in the @entity230			1
nachos with guacamole , sour cream and salsa wine match : @entity15 why it works : from the tangy kick from the salsa to the creaminess of sour cream there 's a lot going on in a plate of nachos so @entity15 is a subtle wine which can get along with a mix of flavours			0
toasted pitta and hummus wine match : @entity21 why it works : fruit flavours of peach and melon , coupled with a subtle touch of oak flavours complements the nutty nature of the chickpeas			0
sea salt and balsamic vinegar crisps wine match : @entity18 why it works : the fresh raspberry and cherry flavours and the hints of spice in the wine work well with the sharpness of the vinegar wasabi peas wine match : @entity21 why it works : the creaminess of the wine takes the heat out of the horseradish in the peas			0
chocolate wine match : merlot why it works : the softness of the tannins and slight sweet fruit in the back matches really nicely with rich chocolate @entity285 wine match : @entity46 why it works : the slightly herbaceous , grassy flavours of the sauv blanc match the salty flavours of the pork scratchings @entity292 egg wine match : @entity52 why it works : the fresh flavours of lemongrass and apricot balance well with the hearty and meaty texture of the scotch egg			1
