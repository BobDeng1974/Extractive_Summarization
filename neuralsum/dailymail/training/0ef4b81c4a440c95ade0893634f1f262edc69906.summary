by @entity0 published : 11:42 est , 19 july 2013 updated : 11:55 est , 19 july 2013 a @entity2 woman is suing the country 's most powerful @entity4 godfather in a bid to recoup £ 115,000 in protection money she paid him over 12 years			1
the unidentified restaurateur says @entity11 , chief of the feared @entity13 gang , owes her a refund for the money she paid out to gang members affiliated to his group			1
as head of the cartel , @entity11 is liable for any damage caused to her or her business by employees under his command , her lawyers claim , citing an anti-organised crime law that was revised in 2008			1
many in @entity2 have lauded the woman for her remarkable bravery in taking on a man who once spent 13 years in prison for the murder of a rival @entity4 boss with a samurai sword			1
fearsome : @entity11 was convicted of murdering a rival yakuza boss in the early 1970s with a samurai sword			1
he was convicted of murder and spent 13 years in prison the woman , from @entity42 , also claims that when she refused to pay the bung in 2008 , @entity13 henchmen threatened to burn down her restaurant			1
this is believed to be the first lawsuit of its kind in @entity2 , @entity47 news agency reported			0
the former restaurant owner is reported to have paid a total of 10.85 million yen ( $ 109,000 ; £ 72,000 ) in in total			1
the rest , lawyers say , will cover damages			0
police figures suggest that the @entity13 make up over 40 per cent of @entity2 's organised criminal underworld , @entity58 news agency reported			1
no nonsense : @entity2 's @entity62 found in november that one in five @entity2 companies shaken down by the yakuza gangsters ended up paying them off @entity11 , also known as @entity11 , began his yakuza career in 1962 when he joined the @entity67 , a @entity42 - based @entity13 affiliate			1
the @entity4 is a collective term given to @entity2 's organised crime syndicates			2
it is estimated that the @entity4 has over 100,000 members spread across the country in different gangs , but together they make the largest organised crime group in the world			2
numerous films have been made about yakuza crime , culture and practice , including the 1993 movie @entity81 ( pictured ) they are known for their controlled organisation and strict codes of conduct , which involves punishments such as ' yubitsume ' for members who break the rules			0
the tradition of ' yubitsume ' , beginning with the first joints of the left hand little finger comes from the @entity2 way of holding a sword with ' yubitsume ' intended to weaken the @entity4 member ’s sword grip			1
the number of members has been on the decline since the @entity2 government introduced the @entity102 in 1992 and as recent as last year , the @entity98 froze assets for the largest @entity104 , the @entity13			2
but his reputation for violence , loyalty and shrewd business acumen saw him rise fast up the ranks			0
perhaps most famously , @entity11 was convicted of murdering a rival yakuza boss in the early 1970s , with a samurai sword			1
he was convicted of murder and spent 13 years in prison			1
but he is seen as an unusual @entity2 crime boss , who likes to keep a lower profile than some of his rivals			2
he insisted on taking the train to his induction ceremony instead of a chauffeured limousine and reportedly stopped in a street noodle restaurant on the way to the lavish yakuza banquet arranged in his honour			2
in november , police revealed one in five @entity2 companies shaken down by the yakuza gangsters ended up paying them off			0
a study released by @entity2 's @entity62 found that of the companies that answered the survey , at least five had paid more than 5million yen ( $ 61,000 ) to meet the demands of yakuza extortionists			0
the survey gives a good indication that @entity2 's ' nine - fingered economy ' is still very much in business			0
police sources acknowledge on background that there may be more companies who actually paid off the yakuza than were willing to admit it in a police survey			0
in october of 2011 , it became a crime in @entity2 to make payments to the yakuza or utilize their services under the organized crime exclusionary ordinances			0
the @entity62 has repeatedly warned people not to give in to yakuza extortion demands			0
inked and stacked : yakuza gangsters are known for their elaborate and often brightly coloured tattoos , called irezumi ( file picture ) crime scene : emergency services at the scene of a reported gang - related incident in @entity167 's @entity166 district despite that , of the 2,885 companies that participated , 337 or 11.7 per cent reported run - ins with yakuza shakedowns			2
of those companies approached by the yakuza , 62 companies or 18 per cent gave into the demands , @entity172 reported			0
police said this figure is probably only the tip of the iceberg			0
for the companies approached by the yakuza , more than half ( 185 ) were pressed for payments or services in the last year .			0

@entity11 is leader of the feared @entity13 gang of @entity42
he has spent 13 years in jail for murdering @entity4 boss with samurai sword
