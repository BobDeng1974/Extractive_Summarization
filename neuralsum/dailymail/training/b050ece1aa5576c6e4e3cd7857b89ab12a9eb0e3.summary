by @entity0 last updated at 6:19 pm on 23rd january 2012 ' behavioural pricing ' would tailor pricing to individual users - with special offers targeted to certain shoppers , but also taking into account information from social networks such as @entity8 or @entity9 online shops already have a frightening amount of information at their fingertips - from whether you 've purchased from them before , to what sites you 've visited before you arrive at their shop , accessible via browsing history			1
but new start - ups could move the idea to a new level - harvesting information from sources such as @entity8 and @entity9 to ' tweak ' prices to what customers are willing to pay			1
in other words , if you 've ' liked ' something , prepare to pay for it			2
one web entrepreneur , @entity30 , founder of @entity31 says that 2012 will be ' the year of behavioural pricing ' - a new type of e-commerce , where prices will be tweaked to include what customers are willing to pay			1
using such freely available information is n't an out - there idea			2
@entity39 , acquired by @entity40 last year , has built a business on harvesting user information from ' cookies ' - invisible internet files - to build up a picture of what audiences like so that advertisers can target people more effectively			1
tweaking prices to suit the individual could be the next step			2
the idea has already started raising privacy alarm bells			0
@entity55 writes , ' this year will mark the end of static pricing			1
the use of your tweets , credit score , and web history in e-commerce pricing is frightening — but ultimately unavoidable			1
' @entity64 describes the idea as a ' consumer 's worst nightmare , a merchant 's dream '			0
@entity70 , chief marketing officer at price comparison website @entity72 says , ' there are many pricing policies already used by retailers that most consumers are completely unaware of			2
' ' these include things like regional pricing variations in the same stores across the country , not to mention retailers using different pricing structures for the same products in stores and online			0
' shops already harvest information from loyalty card programmes , and also use credit ratings to decide what rates some customers should pay for products such as loans			1
@entity30 writes , ' online marketers have dramatically increased the amount of behavioral data they have on consumers			0
it comes from a complex network of web histories , demographic records , loyalty programs , and increasingly , social media profiles			0
in the last few years , behavioral data has matured and gained widespread acceptance and usage in online advertising			0
startups like @entity39 allow advertisers to access “ databanks ” of behavioral information on users , and target advertising to them			0
' @entity72 's @entity115 says that although the idea seems like a next step for businesses , it may be hard to work in the real world - particularly when web shoppers are fond of using apps and comparison sites to track down the best bargains			1
@entity115 says , ' whilst behavioural pricing might seem like the next logical step , it is a hugely complex initiative for retailers to implement			1
' ' the danger of this pricing strategy is that if ‘ social savvy ’ shoppers became aware of it , it could lead to a social media boycott destroying a retailer ’s reputation very quickly			0
' the great thing about price comparison sites like @entity72 is that we offer customers price transparency			0
in essence , customer data does not influence the prices that are displayed on our website			0

' 2012 will be the year of behavioural pricing ' - entrepreneur
sites could use @entity8 ' likes ' to hike prices
tweets , credit score and web history could ' tell ' sites about who you are - and what you *'ll* be willing to pay
