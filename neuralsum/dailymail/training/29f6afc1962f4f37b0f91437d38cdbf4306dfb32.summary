@entity1 journalist @entity0 is to be prosecuted using 19th century press laws a @entity1 journalist is facing a criminal trial under the country ’s strict press laws for remarks made during a radio debate about the influence of @entity10			1
@entity0 , 61 , believes the way he is being treated is an example of how writers are criminalised when the state is able to control the media			0
he was summoned to court under strict press laws which date back to the @entity17 following a complaint from a pressure group called the @entity20 in @entity1 ( @entity21 )			1
‘ in seeking to undermine liberty of expression , a sacred principle of our civilisation , the collective against @entity23 in @entity1 ( @entity21 ) takes the risk of appearing like a menace to democracy , ’ said mr @entity0			1
‘ this is essentially what i hope to be able to explain in court , because i will have to appear in a few months before the 17th @entity35 in @entity36			0
’ mr @entity0 , who has written for @entity38 newspaper for almost 28 years , made some allegedly defamatory remarks on november 15th 2012 during an @entity41 radio programme called ‘ @entity42			0
’ mr @entity0 particularly objected to a @entity21 poster campaign which showed pictures of predominantly bearded and veiled @entity45 under the slogan ‘ we are the @entity48 ’			1
the journalist said that this was against the spirit of @entity1 ’s inclusive , secular republic – something which @entity21 objected to			2
mr @entity0 said that @entity1 ’s @entity54 was being used to ‘ penalise criticism , intimidate journalists , censor the media ’ and even ‘ to reintroduce the offence of blasphemy ’			1
we are the nation : the poster by the @entity20 in @entity1 , which mr @entity0 referred to in the radio debate @entity0 will seek to prove that his words were true , as a defence against the defamation charge the 1881 law was nominally meant to guarantee the ‘ @entity68 ’ but in fact criminalised a range of journalistic behaviour			2
so called ‘ press offenses ’ ranged from insulting the president of @entity1 , to defaming private citizens through comment			0
mr @entity0 said about the case ’s first hearing : ‘ the judge reminded me that he himself had no opportunity to verify the existence of the alleged offense , the procedure - @entity54 1881 - leading automatically to court , where the case will be considered on its merits			0
’ mr @entity0 said the law was ‘ easily manipulated ’ by those who wanted to persecute journalists			2
a spokesman for @entity21 said it had a duty to challenge ‘ @entity23 ’ and the press laws were a logical way of challenging journalism it objected to			1
' mr @entity0 will in court seek to prove that his words were true – one of the defences against defamation			0
