fined : @entity0 and @entity1 pictured arriving at @entity2			1
they were fined £ 630 and ordered to pay £ 300 after they went on holiday with their children during term time a couple were hit with a £ 1,000 penalty yesterday for taking their three children out of school for a foreign holiday			1
@entity1 and @entity15 fell foul of a new law allowing councils to fine parents who fail to ensure their children attend class			1
they returned home from the week - long break to @entity24 – their first family holiday in five years – to find they had been fined £ 360			1
this was soon doubled to £ 720 because they did not pay up quickly enough			1
the case went to a magistrates court yesterday where the @entity31 were forced to enter a guilty plea			2
their fine was amended to £ 630 with £ 300 costs and a £ 63 victim surcharge			1
speaking after the case , mr @entity1 , who works for the @entity36 , said the week in question was the only one he and his wife could both take off work			1
‘ we had no choice but to plead guilty otherwise me and my wife could have been behind bars , ’ added the 39 - year - old			0
‘ surely that would make our children ’s education suffer more than a much - needed holiday ? i ca n’t see the justice in it at all			1
‘ i work in a sensitive job where staffing levels have to be maintained			0
there ’s been a recruitment and overtime ban and it ’s been impossible to arrange summer leave that fits in with the rest of the family			0
‘ i know how important education is – but there ’s a bigger picture			0
family time is important , too , and the children ’s behaviour and schooling has improved massively since our holiday			1
’ justices in @entity71 , @entity72 , rejected the family ’s argument that the holiday was booked before the new school attendance law came into place			2
claims : following the ruling , mr @entity1 said outside court today that ' people who make these laws do not live in the real world ' the @entity1 family : ( left to right ) @entity85 , 13 , mother @entity0 , @entity86 , six , father @entity1 and daughter @entity87 , 15 on holiday in @entity24 the couple – with @entity87 , 15 , @entity85 , 13 , and @entity86 , six – went abroad on september 25 , just 25 days after the law came into force			1
it ended a policy that allowed schools to grant up to ten days off for family holidays			2
now parents are required to send their children to school except in exceptional circumstances			1
offenders risk a £ 2,500 fine or three months in jail			1
the @entity31 had been refused permission by the school but decided to take the holiday anyway			2
paradise : the family of five went to the @entity107 @entity24 , a destination popular with @entity110 tourists the local authority issues a penalty notice to parents who fail to ensure their kids attend school			1
it equates to £ 60 per child , rising to £ 120 if it 's not paid within 21 days			1
after 28 days , if the fine remains unpaid , the local authority is required to begin legal proceedings in a magistrate 's court			1
the couple are being prosecuted under @entity128 of the @entity129 , subsections one and @entity126 two parts refer to a parent 's failure to secure regular attendance at school of registered pupil			2
if a child of compulsory school age fails to attend the school regularly , his parent is guilty of an offence			0
if the parent knows that his child is failing to attend regularly at the school and fails without reasonable justification to cause him to do so , he is guilty of an offence			0
if a person is guilty to any of the above offences they are liable on summary conviction with punishments ranging from a fine to a three - month prison sentence			0
the guidelines apply to all state - funded schools			0
mr @entity1 , who defended himself and wife @entity0 , 36 , in court , added : ‘ i stand by my decision			1
' most parents can take their holiday when kids are off			0
' unfortunately i ca n’t			0
there ’s no flexibility at all			0
if the whole country took their holiday when the kids were off school the country would come to a standstill			0
' it ’s like we are being taxed because i ’m a shift worker			0
‘ i ’m being treated like a criminal because i am trying to do the best for my family			0
’ the @entity172 , from @entity71 , claim they have not lost out because the money they saved with an out - of - season holiday was greater than the penalty			2
prosecuting for @entity178 , @entity177 told the court the family were warned they did not have permission to go on holiday			2
she said : ‘ there was a change in legislation that had been communicated to parents in july via the school newsletter			0
‘ mr and mrs @entity15 had the opportunity to pay the lesser fines totalling £ 360 within 21 days but they chose not to pay			1
the penalty notice clearly states the non-payment of fines will result in prosecution			0
’ a @entity196 spokesman said : ‘ poor attendance at school can have a hugely damaging effect , and children who attend regularly are nearly four times more likely to achieve five or more good gcses than those who are regularly absent			0
youngest : their six - year - old son @entity86 was taken out of @entity205 in @entity71 older children : their daughters @entity85 , 13 , and @entity209 , 15 , both attend @entity210 in @entity71 ‘ that is why we have given schools more power to tackle poor attendance and allowed them to intervene much earlier			0
‘ we have increased the amount parents can be fined for unauthorised absences and cut the amount of time they have to pay			2
‘ parents should never simply discount a possible penalty notice from the cost of a cheaper holiday , because this is a criminal offence			2
