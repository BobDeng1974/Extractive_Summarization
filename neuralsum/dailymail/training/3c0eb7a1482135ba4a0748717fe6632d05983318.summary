by @entity0 an online community of shoplifting bloggers who brag about their ' hauls ' and exchange advice on how best to steal from stores has been exposed , with the network quickly dubbed ' the internet 's @entity7 '			1
the once - under - the - radar ' lifters ' - who have been likened to the seven @entity12 teens who were charged for stealing from celebrity homes and immortalized in @entity15 's @entity7 - blog anonymously under names like @entity17 and @entity18 or @entity19 and use hashtags such as # lifting and # fivefingerdiscount to link in with each other			1
the group were outed by a fellow blogger called we - unhallowed , who noticed the trend quietly percolating on @entity27 and decided to publish a list of the screen names involved			1
' i 've heard our and their generations called '' entitled '' but it 's articulated really well here when you read their text posts about how they steal because they '' deserve nice things '' , ' she wrote , listing over 20 lifting accounts			0
seen here are expensive labels like @entity58 and @entity59 the lifters blog anonymously and many feature disclaimers on their sites saying what they do ' is not true ' in order to cover their tracks one lifter said the lifter community has been bubbling for two years users are also fond of bragging about how much their collective ' haul ' is worth by adding up the price tags of each stolen item the lifting community have been likened to the seven @entity12 teens who were charged for stealing from celebrity homes and immortalized in @entity15 's film @entity75 but while some of the group have lapped up their web infamy , others have hit back at the ' bratty ' @entity7 comparison			1
@entity81 , who was one of the bloggers named on the we - unhallowed list , said the assumption all those in the lifting community are ' white , well - off spoiled teens ' was wide of the mark			2
' i think the amount of girls who are white in this community are maybe ten or less , if that , ' told @entity93			2
' many of us are young adults , many of us have jobs and work hard and still do n't make ends meet			0
' @entity81 , who described herself as a @entity100 art school student , said the lifting community had been around for two years and contains about 100 active users			1
other bloggers i spoke to estimate that there are only around one hundred active lifters in the community â€“ the others are just curious onlookers			1
@entity81 said she struggled to find a part - time job while her parents covered her college loans and housing and turned to stealing ' from companies i was sure it would n't really hurt '			0
before the lid was lifted on what they were doing , members of the network would share methods and stories with each other on how they steal , such as how to remove security tags using magnets and hooks , as well as what stores were easier than others			2
according to an expose on @entity126 , a variety of stores , from @entity128 's to @entity129 and @entity130 , were mentioned			0
the amount of stock boosted in one go is refereed to as a ' haul ' , and lifters would post pictures of their haul , along with how much it all cost , onto their blogs			0
not limited to clothes : a heap of ' hauled ' food - including packets of sushi - and other products sit atop a @entity148 scarf lifters appear to have joined the community from all over the world , from major @entity153 cities to the midwest , from @entity155 to the @entity156 a stash of underwear and some clothes are posted to @entity27 make - up and accessories are a major part of the lifting community ' total damage since april 2014 : $ 366.35 ' one wrote recently			1
@entity27 said they have no guidelines when it comes to posting shoplifting , but said they would cooperate should there be an investigation			1
' posts depicting potentially illegal activity may not , in and of themselves , violate our policies , ' a spokesperson told @entity126			2
many of the @entity27 sites have shut since the list was made public on wednesday , out of fear that , like the @entity7 of burglars , they would be caught			2
' it 's really hard to wrap my head around the fact that i 've gotten away with so much in the past few days , ' one user , @entity183 , wrote			0
lifters say that once you get used to having free products and goods , its almost impossible to stop taking them ' i feel extremely powerful , but at the same time , i feel like i 'm going to be caught any second			0
i guess i do n't make the most confident of shoplifters			0
' another , @entity196 , wrote : ' sometimes im really afraid that the shoplifting community will be outed and become like a viral joke on the internet or something			1
' imagine the embarrasment ( sic ) if you are identified and everyone at school / work and your neighbours ( sic ) and family finds out			0
