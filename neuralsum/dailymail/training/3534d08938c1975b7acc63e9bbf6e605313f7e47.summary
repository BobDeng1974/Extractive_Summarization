by @entity1 reporter published : 15:55 est , 8 december 2013 updated : 05:14 est , 10 december 2013 @entity2 and @entity3 have reached a deal with the government that lets the two form the world 's biggest airline a judge refused to block a merger between @entity2 and @entity3 on saturday evening , saying a bankruptcy judge correctly rejected arguments made by a lawyer for some consumers			1
@entity16 attorney @entity15 argued that the deal would harm fliers because it would result in less competition and higher prices			1
@entity21 district judge @entity20 repeatedly noted that his arguments relied on outdated facts , had no evidence to support them and sometimes made no sense			1
the @entity27 : @entity3 and @entity2 officials plan to sign the papers to make the marriage final , prior to the start of market trading monday cleared for takeoff : @entity3 ceo @entity34 , who becomes @entity35 ceo on monday , will ring the opening bell for @entity37 as the new stock symbol , @entity39 , starts trading one happy family : @entity2 and @entity3 are set to combine to become the world 's biggest airline ' there is nothing in the record from which i can make a finding that your clients are likely to be irreparably injured -- personally , ' she said			1
@entity21 is owned by @entity52 and is based in @entity53 , @entity54			1
the company has said it plans to complete the merger with @entity57 , @entity58 - based @entity3 on monday			1
@entity20 said a federal bankruptcy judge was ' correct in all respects ' in deciding last week to let the merger proceed			2
she also refused to stay the effect of her ruling while @entity63 appeals to the 2nd @entity21 @entity64			1
@entity63 complained friday to @entity20 that he 'd gotten ' the bum 's rush , with all due respect , by the bankruptcy court			2
' deal : under the proposal , @entity21 and @entity3 would sell 104 takeoff and landing slots at @entity73 in @entity74 , 34 slots at @entity76 in @entity77 @entity20 said @entity63 had failed to show consumers would suffer irreparable harm or that he was likely to succeed in his effort to temporarily block the merger until a trial could be conducted on his antitrust lawsuit			1
@entity85 said last week that even if @entity63 won his lawsuit , he could demand additional divestitures by the two airlines but could not wreck the merger			1
@entity63 's case lacked proof , said attorney @entity91 for @entity92 ' we 're here on just attorney argument and rhetoric , ' he said the merger means @entity21 , @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 will control more than 80 per cent of the @entity21 market			1
a series of mergers in the industry since 2005 has reduced nine big airlines to four in august , the @entity105 had sued to block the merger , saying it would hurt competition and produce higher prices			1
but regulators settled their case in exchange for the airlines ' promise to surrender some coveted landing rights at @entity73 near @entity74 and @entity114 in @entity77 and a few gates at five other airports			1
competing low - cost carriers will also be given more access to airports in @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 , the government said			1
' this is very good news and we are grateful to all who have made it happen , ' said @entity34 , ceo of @entity3 , and incoming ceo of the combined airline , which will be based in @entity123 / @entity53 and go by the @entity21 name			1
' we are pleased to have this lawsuit behind us and look forward to building the new @entity2 together			0
' under the terms of the settlement , the airlines will divest 52 slot pairs at @entity73 and 17 slot pairs at @entity114			1
the airlines will also surrender two gates each at @entity121 's @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity124 and @entity125			1
' it provides more competition than exists today in this industry , ' @entity144 said			2
' that is good news for consumers all across the country who will benefit from more choices and more competitive airfares			2
' what next : the settlement still needs to be approved by the @entity156 in the @entity74 as well as a judge overseeing @entity2 Â¿ bankruptcy proceeding			2
the merger could deal could be done by mid-december after completion of the required divestitures , the combined company expects to operate 44 fewer daily departures at @entity73 and 12 fewer daily departures at @entity114 than the approximately 290 daily @entity73 departures and 175 daily @entity76 departures that @entity21 and @entity3 operate today			1
@entity34 said the combined airline must still decide which destinations to drop because of the lost slots at @entity73 and @entity114			2
but he said they would be announced with enough time for the airlines that acquire the slots to decide whether to continue serving those communities			2
' we do indeed serve some communities that it is unlikely will be served by those that pick up these slots , ' @entity34 said			0
@entity180 , ceo of @entity21 , said the loss of slots is relatively modest , totaling about 15 % of the combined airlines ' slots at @entity73 and 7 % at @entity114			1
but the airlines said the changes would n't reduce total employment at the new company			2
' this is an important day for our customers , our people and our financial stakeholders , ' @entity180 said			2
' this agreement allows us to take the final steps in creating the new @entity2			2
' saving the day : @entity196 bought out @entity3 in 2005			0
the airline was days away from being liquidated			0
@entity196 ceo @entity34 headed up the new airline , a post he still has to this day and will continue with the new @entity2 end result : after completion of the divestitures , the combined carrier expects to operate 44 fewer daily departures at @entity73 and 12 fewer daily departures at @entity76			1
today , the airlines operate 290 and 175 flights respectively at those airports to maintain its service to small and medium - size airports that @entity3 warned might suffer from a reduction in slots at @entity73 and @entity114 , the combined company announced plans to use its gates at @entity73 to serve those communities			1
another part of the settlement also committed the combined @entity21 to maintain its hubs in @entity222 , @entity77 's @entity223 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity142 , @entity224 and @entity225			1
for a period of five years , the merged company will continue daily service from those hubs to each of the states participating in the lawsuit : @entity58 , @entity233 , @entity234 , @entity235 , @entity236 and @entity237			0
@entity98 issued a statement welcoming the agreement and saying the airline ' looks forward to the opportunity to acquire slots that will be divested under the agreement , particularly at @entity74 - @entity73			1
' @entity98 said it is the airline best positioned to continue competitive non-stop flights from @entity73 to small and midsize cities that could otherwise see service reduced or eliminated			1
