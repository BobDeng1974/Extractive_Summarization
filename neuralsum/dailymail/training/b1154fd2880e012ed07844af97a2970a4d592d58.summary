by @entity0 published : 08:02 est , 16 october 2012 updated : 09:39 est , 16 october 2012 after more than £ 7million was spent evicting travellers from @entity3 in @entity4 , the site was supposed to be turned back into greenbelt fields			1
but one year on council bosses have failed to uphold their pledge , leaving the six - acre empty space a dumping ground for fly - tippers			1
rotten food , mounds of rubble and stained furniture now cover what used to be @entity18 's largest illegal travellers ' site			2
aftermath : one year after the contentious and costly eviction of travellers from the site , the land in @entity4 has become a dumping ground for fly - tippers the six - acre site is littered with rubbish and debris as council bosses have failed to uphold their pledge to turn the land into greenbelt fields a woman is pictured holding a cross as police and bailiffs move in on @entity3 , @entity4 , in october last year burnt out sofas , broken tables , used mattresses and industrial waste of all shapes and sizes lie scattered on the barren wasteland			1
this week marks the one - year anniversary of the controversial clearance of hundreds of travellers from the site near @entity46 in @entity4 , following a bitter decade - long legal row			1
more than 300 riot police and hundreds more bailiffs dramatically swept onto the former scrapyard during an early morning operation that led to bloody and violent confrontations			1
the anticipated campaign to fight the eviction , which some feared could last months , was all over within 36 hours as the activists who had pledged to support the travellers ' to the death ' gave up their campaign and walked from the site			1
@entity60 , which led the £ 7.1million eviction , pledged to uphold planning law by removing 80 families from illegal plots and returning the land back to greenbelt fields			1
but photographs captured in recent days have revealed that the clear - up of @entity3 has failed to happen - with the abandoned site overrun with rubbish from fly - tippers			1
burnt out sofas , broken tables , stained mattresses and industrial waste of all shapes and sizes lie scattered on the wasteland nearby residents claim there is a shocking lack of progress being made in transforming the site into greenbelt land @entity86 , smelling rubbish is piled up to head - height and mounds of rubble have been dumped on the land			2
sofas lie in the mud alongside broken , rusting , washing machines			0
aerial photos taken from the air this week revealed the shocking lack of progress made since police and bailiffs employed by the council stormed onto @entity3 , supported by hundreds of riot police from forces across the country in october last year			1
officials from the @entity105 have been carrying out tests on the soil amid concerns that the land is toxic and a report is expected within weeks			0
but those neighbouring the six - acre site have expressed concern that many of those who lived on @entity3 have simply moved to an adjacent site just yards away on @entity117 , exceeding its authorised capacity			1
this means a second bout of enforcement action to remove those living there illegally remains likely			2
this site is authorised for some travellers plots but it is currently thought to be over-occupied by more than 100 people			2
@entity128 , 53 , the most outspoken of the homeowners affected by the continued occupation , said : ' there have not been any positives to come out of this for me - it has just been a joke - the travellers are just yards away and now the site is overun with rats and dumped rubbish			1
' the property developer , whose garden backs onto the site , is considering legal action against @entity60 for the loss of hundreds of thousands of pounds to the value of his property			0
officials from the @entity105 have been carrying out tests on the soil amid concerns that the land is toxic and a report is expected within weeks caravans are pictured parked along the entrance road to the illegal site in @entity4 this week he fumed : ' i have no sympathy for the council - they should have gone in there as soon as it was clear and put it back to greenbelt land as they promised they would - it is as simple as that			1
' instead , they have achieved nothing in the past year			0
' i feel that the whole thing has been a huge waste of millions of pounds of taxpayers ’ money and you have to wonder why it even happened because the travellers are now just a bit further down the road and still living illegally			1
' many of the travellers who left @entity3 are still living illegally on @entity117 just yards from where the eviction took place			1
@entity184 , 47 , slammed @entity60 for spending millions of taxpayers ’ money on the eviction then allowing it to become a ' toxic dumping ground '			0
the single mother had lived at @entity3 for years before last october ’s costly eviction but has since moved just yards away to a one - bedroom trailer on the side of a small lane leading into the illegal site			1
she said : ' they have spent £ 7m and what for ? we ’re still here but now we have no toilets , no showers , no electric			2
this place looks like something you see in that film , @entity206 , not a green belt site			1
the legal side of the site is now crammed full of travellers from the illegal site , including many caravans parked on the entrance road no ' ethnic cleansing ' : travellers and supporters last year campaigned against the removal of 80 families from the farm ' we ’re scared to sleep at night ‘ cause people come in the middle of the night to tip their rubbish where we used to live			1
' the site ’s become a toxic dumping ground which is dangerous for our little kids			0
' they think it ’s a playground but there ’s asbestos and everything down there so we have to try to keep them out			0
' the whole eviction has been an utter shambles			0
it ’s 11 years on and we ’re no further on			0
' just last week she rushed to hospital after suffering a severe asthma attack which she blamed on stress caused by the threat of a new eviction from the lane			2
looking back at the eviction , she added : ' on the day there were woman and children running and screaming everywhere			2
it was like something out of the @entity251 as everyone was panicking			0
' i managed to get out before the riot police started attacking our homes			0
i was one of the lucky ones as a lot of people were injured			0
' the results of an @entity105 investigation into potentially dangerous pollutants - including asbestos and engine oil - allegedly dug up by council contractors during the eviction - is expected within the coming weeks			2
travellers originally refused to leave the site , which many had lived on for years @entity270 spent £ 4.8million on the clearance although it had budgeted to spend up to £ 8m had the eviction dragged out into the winter months			1
@entity273 splashed out £ 2.4million on supporting the council			2
a council leader who oversaw the clearance of the site has defended the eviction despite the concerns the site has become an eyesore			1
@entity282 , leader of @entity60 , said : ' doing nothing was simply not an option			0
' ' at the moment , we know that the site is not something that people would recognise as a green belt site			1
' however it must be remembered that the 6.5 acres that made up the illegal settlement remains in the ownership of the travellers and the state of the site is their responsibility at the current time			0
the council simply does not have the legal right to enter the land			0
' since the site was cleared in november 2011 , the council has been working tirelessly to deal with the continued breaking of planning and civil law on @entity117			2
i am clear that this is the right thing to do , just as clearing @entity3 was the right thing to do			0
' let me be clear			0
every single issue in the @entity117 area at the moment has its origins in the persistent law - breaking of the traveller community over the last ten years			0
violent confrontations eventually led to the travellers being removed from the site after a decade - long battle ' we are dealing with these issues and we are working through the legal and planning process which does take time and has to be done step by step			1
' @entity328 , a former @entity3 resident , said : ' the way we 're treated , it 's like we 're not human beings - we 're seen as a problem that they need to get rid of			0
' there are more travellers than there are sites , so where do they expect us to live ? it 's so hard to tell my children that we 're never going to get to go home			0
' referring to travellers living on the @entity117 roadside , council leader mr @entity282 added : ' they are breaking the law and we remain committed to taking the appropriate action , and will follow the correct process to do this			2
' this will take time , but we remain steadfast in our commitment to upholding the law			0
' protesters are planning to target the @entity355 offices in @entity356 on friday to mark the first anniversary of the eviction			0
the group said it would ' disrupt operations '			0
@entity361 , a supporter who resisted the eviction at @entity3 , said : ; last year i could n't believe i was seeing 83 families made homeless by the government ; but it 's not just @entity3 , it 's happening all over the @entity368			1

council bosses promised the site in @entity372 , @entity4 would be turned back into greenbelt fields to be *enjoyed* by *locals*
more than £ 7million was spent evicting families from the site in a morning operation that led to violent confrontations
many travellers who left @entity3 are still living illegally on a lane just yards from where the 2011 eviction took place
' this place looks like something you see in @entity206 , not a green belt site ' , says mother who lived there
