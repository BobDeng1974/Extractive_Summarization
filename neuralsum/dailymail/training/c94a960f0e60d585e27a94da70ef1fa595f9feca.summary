in an era where airlines rarely offer complimentary peanuts anymore , it 's surprising that a captain would go out of his way to feed passengers on a delayed flight			1
but that 's just what one unnamed @entity10 pilot did this week when he reached into his own wallet to pay for a round of pizzas			2
the kind act happened on a flight from @entity17 monday night , bound for @entity18			1
@entity10 flight 719 was scheduled to leave at 5:48pm , according to @entity20 , but did n't leave the tarmac until nearly an hour later			0
as the plane approached the @entity18 area , they ran into a severe thunderstorm and the captain was forced to circle around the western @entity41 until the storm cleared			1

' he said “ ladies and gentleman , @entity10 is known for being one of the cheapest airlines in the @entity73 , but your captain is not cheap			0
i just ordered pizza for the entire plane			0
” ' the captain ordered 50 pizzas which were handed out to the appreciative passengers by the flight crew			1
miss @entity86 took several pictures of the flight attendants bringing the pizza boxes through the cabin to passengers with smiles on their faces			0
