@entity0 is refusing to screen for @entity2 victims at its borders – despite the @entity5 saying it will introduce the safeguards this weekend			1
the @entity0 receives more air passengers from the affected @entity9 countries than any other nation , but health officials here say the screening – a simple temperature test and questionnaire – is unnecessary			1
as health secretary @entity17 called the @entity2 outbreak a ' serious global health emergency ' , @entity16 ordered his officials to screen travellers at five major airports			1
people across the world are now testing positive for the deadly virus and yesterday @entity26 died in a @entity28 hospital from the disease			1
a nurse in @entity31 who treated two @entity2 patients at a @entity34 hospital is in quarantine and this morning it was revealed that a 57 - year - old @entity38 woman is being tested after showing symptoms			1
she had recently returned to @entity40 from @entity41 and fell ill after a week of being back in her native country			1
the @entity45 sheriff 's deputy , sgt @entity44 , has also been hospitalised over fears he may have contracted the virus after attending the home of mr @entity26 a week ago			2
her husband has also been placed in quarantine , while her dog @entity74 was put down overnight amid fears the animal could spread the disease			2
@entity78 , chairman of the home affairs select committee , said @entity0 should follow in the footsteps of the @entity5 and start airport screening			2
' we need to put in screening at our borders , ' he said			0
' we do n't want to deal with this after the event			0
' but defence secretary @entity86 told @entity88 's @entity87 : ' we take advice from the @entity90 that screening is best done on exit from these countries			1
' we are taking all the precautions and @entity95 are ready to deal with symptoms and deal with it directly			0
’ the row erupted as : people outside @entity100 as they leave @entity101 , with fear of the virus spreading in @entity104 screening at border points , which was first used during the @entity107 sars outbreak in 2002 , involves a simple temperature test , sometimes accompanied by a health questionnaire			1
a thermal scanner is pointed at the passenger 's forehead to detect an elevated fever			0
' we do n't want to deal with this after the event ' : @entity78 , chairman of the home affairs select committee , said @entity0 must ' put in screening at our borders ' if the temperature is above normal , the passenger would be questioned about their movements and medical history , and taken for further tests			1
last night a no 10 source said @entity129 believed other actions were more effective than screening , but added that it had not been completely ruled out			0
' the @entity5 are doing this , and we will want to look at how it is implemented and how effective it is , ' the source said			0
' we are not convinced it is effective , but we are staying flexible			0
' @entity5 officials said screening ebola would start at five major airports – @entity143 's @entity142 , @entity144 in @entity145 , @entity146 in the @entity5 capital , @entity148 in @entity149 and @entity55 in @entity150 – as early as this weekend			1
passengers arriving from affected countries @entity101 , @entity41 and @entity153 will be given questionnaires and have their temperatures taken			1
professor @entity156 , who was part of the team that identified @entity2 in 1976 , said he was not concerned about a mass outbreak of the killer disease here , but we should be ready for isolated cases amongst those who have travelled to @entity9 to help in the outbreak			1
prof @entity156 , a director of the @entity166 , said he never believed an @entity2 outbreak could have become so deadly			2
he told @entity168 : ' let 's not forget that in the 38 years since 1976 there have only been about 1,500 people who died from @entity2 , less than 40 a year			1
' so it was n't really a big issue , a big public health problem , but here it got completely out of control in the first place because we never knew and imagined it could pop up in west africa			0
the response was very slow so it got out of control before the current measures were put in place			0
it makes it much more difficult			0
' foreign secretary @entity186 said : ' the disease is an unprecedented threat that knows no borders			2
we now need the wider international community to step up to the plate			0
' we all have to do more if we are going to prevent what is currently a crisis from becoming a catastrophe			0
' @entity0 has the busiest air hubs in the world , receiving more passengers than any other nation from @entity41 , @entity101 and @entity153			1
previous case : screening at border points was first used during the @entity107 sars outbreak in 2002			2
here , flight attendants from @entity204 wear masks at @entity206 in @entity207 in april 2003 although all direct flights between @entity210 and the three countries have been suspended , more than 6,000 people make the journey each week , changing in @entity213 , @entity214 or @entity215 en route to @entity217 or @entity218			2
the @entity5 , in comparison , sees between 3,000 and 6,000 passengers a week from the region			0
mr @entity17 last night admitted the scale of the crisis was almost unprecedented			1
' this is clearly one of the most serious global health emergencies of recent years – we are taking it incredibly seriously , ' he said			1
' our first priority as the government is to make sure the @entity0 people are safe			0
it is now entirely possible that someone with ebola will come to the @entity0 either by one route or another			1
' but @entity235 reiterated its reluctance to put screening measures into place			2
a spokesman said : ' there are no plans to introduce entry screening for ebola in the @entity0			1
' this would require the @entity0 to screen every returning traveller , as people could return to the @entity0 from an affected country through any port of entry			2
this would be huge numbers of low - risk people			0
' single location : the @entity0 has only one high - level isolation ward equipped to deal with ebola – at the @entity255 in @entity210 ( pictured in august ) mr @entity78 said more urgent action was needed			1
' the best way to be safe is to make sure we put in preventative measures now , ' he said			0
' to hang on and not do this does not help the public feel there is confidence in the system			0
' we do n't want to deal with this after the event just because we have the best health service in the world			0
we do n't want to test it to see if it can cope with ebola			0
' it emerged last night that every major hospital in @entity235 has been put on high alert over the crisis			1
city hospitals , specialist centres and intensive care units have been told to prepare for an influx of patients infected with the disease			2
' any hospital that has an infectious diseases unit or is able to isolate a patient is gearing up for this , ' an @entity283 source told the @entity288			0
the @entity0 has only one high - level isolation ward equipped to deal with ebola – at the @entity255 in @entity210			2
three other hospitals , in @entity292 , @entity293 and @entity294 , have been identified as possible ebola ' surge ' centres if there was a large outbreak .			0
