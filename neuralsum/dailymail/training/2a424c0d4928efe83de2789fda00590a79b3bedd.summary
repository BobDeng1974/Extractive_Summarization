they produced a retro match programme on monday night to commemorate the 1962 fa cup final between these two clubs at @entity4 , back in the days when @entity5 and @entity6 were competing for the highest honours in @entity9 football			1
how sad then that the @entity10 at @entity11 , named after one of the heroes of that @entity5 side , was shut down in advance and left empty due to a glaring lack of local interest for the first @entity18 tie here in four years			1
it was a depressing indication of how far the old competition has fallen in the eyes of some supporters , particularly when two @entity25 rivals meet in the early rounds ; even more so on this occasion when the game was shunted back to a peculiar monday night slot on the day most people were returning to work after a fixture intensive @entity33 break			0
‘ it ’s a tough one for fans , ’ admitted @entity5 manager @entity58			1
‘ monday night is an awkward one			0
both teams made the decision on that because of the physicality			0
' there ’s been a real amount of miles put on the clock by our players , so that worked for us as a small group			0
‘ it ’s slightly different for @entity6			1
they made seven changes and had £ 130million - worth of talent on the pitch so i do n’t think there was a lack of quality with the players coming in			2
‘ but maybe that affected the ticketing and people coming to the stadium			0
' and , of course , all these @entity25 games			0
they ’re not cheap for everyone up here so i understand that			0
’ @entity58 revealed that his squad has been further depleted by the loss of defender @entity94 , who will miss the rest of the season after rupturing a cruciate ligament in the draw at @entity99 on @entity100			2
@entity5 will now step up their efforts to extend @entity103 ’s loan from @entity104 or sign him on a permanent basis			1
a ball boy watches on from the empty stands as @entity6 and @entity5 fight it out at @entity11 @entity5 boss @entity58 shows his frustration from the sidelines during his side 's @entity18 clash a replay was the last thing @entity6 needed as they face a fixture pile - up in the second half of the season due to their commitments in the @entity120 and @entity121			1
@entity35 ’s side will have to play at least 11 games between now and the end of february , and at best will have only one free midweek between now and mid-march			0
‘ i ’m a little bit disappointed because we need to play another 90 minutes ’ said the @entity6 boss			1
‘ but we are still in the @entity18 and it is important for @entity6 to be in the next round			2

the @entity10 was shut down *ahead* of the match
@entity11 was nearly half empty for the match that ended 1 - 1
@entity135 fired @entity6 in front in the 56th minute
@entity38 replied for @entity5 to snatch a draw for the home side
