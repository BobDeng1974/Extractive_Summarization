by @entity1 correspondent many parents dread the moment when they have to explain the birds and the bees to their children			2
but in @entity8 ’s case , they simply enlisted the help of a rather famous family friend			2
when she was just eight years old , the 54 - year - old was given a sex education lesson by legendary actor @entity13			1
@entity8 , left , got a ' calm ' response when she questioned @entity13 , right , about the facts of life the actress - who has previously admitted creating a ‘ sex handbook ’ for her own 13 - year - old daughter - received a ‘ calm and accurate response ’ when she asked him for details , her mother has revealed			1
@entity24 , who is also an actress , said she felt ‘ faint ’ at the time , but admitted she and her husband @entity26 were equally forthright when it came to educating their two daughters about the facts of life			1
the 81 - year - old told the @entity33 magazine : ‘ i think i drew pictures			2
my husband was blunt and i did the diagrams			2
@entity24 , miss @entity8 's mother , felt faint when her daughter began questioning mr @entity13 ‘ sex is ridiculous behaviour from adults who tell you not to pick your nose			1
@entity8 , aged eight , once asked @entity13 about the details and he gave her a calm and accurate response : very helpful , though i felt a bit faint			1
‘ @entity49 , then five , listened gravely , fixing him with her headlamp eyes			0
’ in an interview last year miss @entity8 , who has won two @entity51 and two @entity52 , revealed she was sexually abused by a children ’s magician at her eighth birthday party			1
she said the ‘ old man ’ offered her a sweet before sticking his tongue down her throat , adding : ‘ he gave me the sweet and said , “ will you give me a kiss ? ” and i said yes			2
so i went up to kiss him on the cheek and he planted his mouth on mine , stuck his tongue in my mouth and wiggled it about			0
‘ i thought it was my fault - children always think it ’s their fault			0
’ miss @entity8 also said she had created a sex handbook to arm her daughter @entity76 , 13 , against material she might find on the internet			1
she said : ‘ i drew pictures and said , you know , you can sometimes feel things in your loins you do n’t feel in your heart , and you need to look at that			0
‘ if you listen to what ’s going on in your emotional language , you will be able to keep the sexual activities safe			0
’ @entity89 , whose most recent tv appearance was in @entity92 drama @entity91 , revealed her second daughter , actress @entity93 , 52 , has equally curious children			1
she said : ‘ my grandson @entity96 , while at school , did a picture of a lighthouse , which his teacher took to be quite another thing			0
‘ she was not amused			0
a good laugh with a teacher on this difficult subject would be very valuable			0
i think she missed a trick .			0

the actress has created a sex education guide for her own daughter
miss @entity8 's mother , @entity24 , said the *incident* made her ' faint '
