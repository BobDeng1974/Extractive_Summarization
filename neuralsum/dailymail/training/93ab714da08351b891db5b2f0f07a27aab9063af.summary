what to do for a family holiday when the children have grown too old for @entity3 ? one option is to graduate to @entity5 , where the countryside is beautiful - and there are plenty of bicycles to go around			1
a pedal - powered trip along the ‘ @entity17 ’ - those miles of unspoilt coastline that stretch along the north of @entity14 island - is @entity3 with knobs on			1
pedal power : the cycle paths of the @entity17 are a fine destination for a family summer holiday or , perhaps , being @entity17 , that should be ‘ with knøbs on ’			1
maybe it is because so many parts of @entity27 have become wretchedly overpopulated , but it comes as a delightful shock to be in a country where there seem to be so few people			2
we could cycle for 30 minutes down coastal tracks and forest trails , and not meet a soul			1
one morning , the only person we see is a man from the local council on a motor - mower , as he prettifies our route			2
and what a pretty route it is			2
the upper @entity14 coast - from @entity45 in the east ( where @entity47 was immortalised by @entity48 as the home of @entity50 ) to the fishing town of @entity52 in the west - is utterly gorgeous			1
fresh air and wide horizons : the @entity17 @entity17 specialises in quiet beaches and @entity58 charm our family itinerary is a perfect arrangement of self - led routes , tailor - made to be the right length for all ages and abilities - stuffed with sights and food - stop opportunities			1
very quickly , we are able to confirm the observation in that waspishly accurate book , a xenophobe ’s guide to the @entity5 , that cycling to @entity5 is what skiing is to @entity73 and driving is to @entity75			2
not to ride a bicycle is a sign of eccentricity			2
during our week , we spend two nights in each of three different seaside hotels , cycling a total of about 150 miles - with all luggage transportation taken care of			2
our first stop , after an efficient train journey from @entity86 airport , is the family - run @entity88 , overlooking the @entity91 - the strip of sea which separates @entity5 from @entity94 , and is just two miles ‘ wide ’ at its narrowest			1
after breakfast , we have a get - to - know - you session with our rental bikes			2
these come fitted with a handy handlebar map - rest , spanners and puncture - repair kit ( only required once )			2
let 's do lunch : the @entity104 halted in @entity105 for - surprisingly inexpensive - fish and chips we pedal a few miles down the coast to visit a museum detailing the life of the author @entity111 , whose colonial memoir @entity113 was turned into a film starring @entity115 and @entity116			0
our second day entails a delightful inland route through woods to the magnificent royal palace of @entity120 ( ‘ the @entity121 ’ )			0
after this meandering 26 - mile effort , we take the train back to base ( the tickets cost 72 krone ( £ 7 ) each , plus £ 1.20 per bike ) - and set off west the next morning to take in the fishing village of @entity105 , and miles of empty white - sand beaches			1
i do n’t know why anyone would want to persuade us that this is the ‘ @entity136 ’ - because nothing could be further removed from that now oligarch - infested @entity135 resort			0
apart from the beaches , our route takes us past several freshwater lakes , in which we swim with few other souls in sight			1
the cliché about @entity143 is that it is ‘ very expensive ’			0
this is not exactly true			0
fish and chips at @entity149 ’s @entity148 costs a mere £ 6.40			0
a palace to be proud of : @entity120 has been described - not without reason - as the ' @entity152 ' picnics are another treat			0
a splendid deli called @entity156 in the village of @entity158 even sells guilt - inducing pork scratchings			0
this leads us to ponder that unsolved conundrum - if the home of @entity17 bacon has more pigs than people , where on earth are they all ? we do not see a single one			1
we do , however , come across a beautiful @entity170 monastery in @entity171 - a religious relic , consecrated in 1151 , with a kitchen herb garden			0
one member of staff is dressed in medieval costume			0
this sight is capped 15 minutes later when we stop to see if the church in the village of @entity180 is open			0
inside , a young bearded man is sitting at a piano , playing @entity185 ’s @entity184 from memory			0
it is hard to sum up the wonder of the region - but a morning visit to the cliff - top home of the @entity193 explorer @entity194 rather encapsulates our trip			1
this thatched house is now a museum with heart - stirring views out to sea			0
like many small places , it only accepts cash or @entity17 credit cards			1
short of krone for the ( £ 5 ) entrance fee , we can not go in			0
but the couple on reception do not want us to be disappointed and let us in for free - then give us a personal guided tour			0
two wheels good : @entity45 , one of the key towns on @entity14 island , is a lovely place to pause our last two days are based at the @entity215 in the seaside village of @entity217 - a soothing reward after a week ’s cycling			1
we flabbergast the locals by going for a pre-breakfast swim			0
‘ i thought we were supposed to be @entity223 - not you wimpy @entity224 ’ one says			0
the word ‘ @entity228 ’ comes from the @entity226 , and refers to ‘ an expedition overseas ’			0
with the @entity223 having conquered @entity27 so brutally , it seems apt for us to make the reverse ‘ expedition overseas ’ some 1,200 years later - to upstage a descendant of those fearless warriors			1
@entity235 ( 0844 493 0787 , www.ba.com ) flies to @entity86 from £ 93 return			1
@entity237 ( 01653 617000 , www.inntravel.co.uk ) offers a self - guided cycling break on the @entity17 from £ 1,098 pp based on two sharing , including six nights ’ @entity242 , four dinners , luggage transfers , route notes and maps , and 18 - gear cycle hire			1

@entity14 , the island home of @entity86 , is a great place for family travel
the north and west coasts of the island are known as the ' @entity17 '
long cycle paths and little beaches make for a very *relaxed* destination
