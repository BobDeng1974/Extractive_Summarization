do you have any information to suggest @entity5 's enemies could use attack our country or military using the virus ? for example with suicide agents who are infected by the disease or who have access to bodily fluids containing the disease			1
and what is your contingency plan to fight this ? @entity149 : well , i do n't believe there is any evidence to suggest that is a likely course of action			0
one of the things , @entity86 , that we have playing to our advantage is our geographic ( sic ) isolation			0

@entity127 : and so are the civilian doctors and civilian nurses that ... i 'm not sure the ratio between defence and civilian now within that medical corps ... are they prepared to fight the @entity19 alongside the military ? i 'm not sure what their contracts are			1
