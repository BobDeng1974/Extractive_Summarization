@entity0 is set to win his 100th @entity2 cap against @entity3 on saturday			1
but despite his haul and a stunning medal collection at @entity6 , debate still rages whether he is a true great of @entity10 football			1
@entity14 's @entity13 - @entity12 , @entity15 and @entity11 give their verdicts on a brilliant but turbulent career so far and reveal what they think the future holds for @entity2 's ninth centurion			1
our three wise men : ( left - right ) @entity12 , @entity15 and @entity11 @entity12 holds off @entity0 at @entity24 in 2010 - but the striker scored in @entity6 's 2 - 1 victory @entity15 takes on @entity0 during @entity6 's 2 - 1 win that condemned @entity28 to relegation in 2005 @entity11 looks on as a frustrated @entity0 protests during @entity32 's defeat at @entity33 in august 2003 q : what is your favourite @entity0 memory in an @entity2 shirt ? @entity39 : probably his first tournament - @entity40			1
he was a boy in a man ’s body : so strong , aggressive and raw			1
he took @entity46 by storm			2
he played with real joy , sprinkled with aggression			2
@entity12 : i have to go back to the @entity51 in @entity52 10 years ago			2
i will never forget being on the substitutes ’ bench for the opening game against @entity56 and seeing the look of shock and panic on the faces of the @entity62 defenders faces when @entity0 started bulldozing his way past them			1
@entity65 : his second goal against @entity68 at @entity40 , when he was one - on - one with the keeper			2
it looked like it was his 100th cap , not his first major tournament			1
@entity0 powers past @entity74 during @entity2 's opening match of @entity40 @entity0 slots the ball home for his second goal against @entity68 at @entity40 @entity78 - 125 caps @entity80 - 115 @entity81 - 114 @entity82 - 108 @entity83 - 107 @entity84 - 106 @entity85 - 106 @entity86 - 105 @entity87 : 100 caps is a great achievement , but has @entity0 been the player he could have been ? @entity12 : after the @entity92 , we all thought we had a future @entity93 in our ranks who would take @entity2 to glory			1
he was fearless and unplayable in that tournament , his impact was incredible			2
it has n’t quite worked out the way we all thought but , listen : very few players get to the level of world ’s best			2
there might not be an international trophy but he ’s still had a phenomenal career			1
@entity39 : it is very difficult to criticise someone who has reached 100 caps			1
but we did expect more from him back then			2
he ’s our most talented player in a long time but he has n’t scored enough goals in major tournaments			1
he has just one goal in a @entity118			2
but he ’s had an incredible career and is not the first great player to be better for their club than their country			1
he will probably admit it has n’t always gone the way he ’d have liked			2
@entity65 : when he arrived on the scene so young , we wondered if he ’d be the greatest who has ever played for @entity2			1
he is one of the greats but not the all - time great			2
only at the last @entity118 did he seem to be fit going into a major tournament			0
there is a feeling that he has n’t quite lived up to expectations			0
but we were asking too much of him , especially at tournaments			0
@entity0 ( left ) laughs as he sprints alongside @entity135 ( right ) during @entity2 training on friday the striker encourages team - mates including @entity139 ( left ) and @entity140 ( centre ) this strike against @entity143 in @entity144 in june remains @entity0 's only goal at a @entity118 finals @entity0 lifts the @entity147 ( 2013 ) , the @entity148 ( 2008 ) and the @entity149 ( 2010 ) q : @entity0 will be @entity2 ’s ninth centurion - who is your personal favourite ? @entity39 : @entity82 , because he ’s the only one who lifted the @entity118 and my dad spoke about him in glowing terms			1
i love hearing my dad ’s stories about him			0
everything he did was so meticulous , he even ironed his underpants			0
@entity65 : i didnt see the 1966 team so i ’d choose @entity81			0
i saw his brilliant raw material straight away			0
he was quiet at first and i enjoyed helping him when he first came into the squad			0
he was less confident than @entity85 and i wish had been captain for longer			0
@entity12 : i would have to choose sir @entity84			0
he is the best player we have ever had , he remains our leading goalscorer and , as a member of the 1966 squad , his place in history has long since been secured			1
he was a truly world - class performer for club and country			0
most importantly , he was a gentleman and remains so to this day			0
@entity118 winners @entity84 ( left ) and @entity82 , pictured with a mascot at @entity174 in 1982 @entity81 retired from international football after @entity2 's miserable @entity118 in @entity176 @entity147 x5 : 2007 , 2008 , 2009 , 2011 , 2013 @entity179 x2 : 2006 , 2010 @entity148 : 2008 @entity180 : 2008 @entity149 @entity181 : 2010 @entity183 x2 : 2005 , 2006 @entity149 @entity147 @entity185 x3 : 2006 , 2010 , 2012 @entity186 : 2010 99 @entity2 caps , 43 @entity2 goals q : what does @entity0 need to do to extend his @entity2 career ? @entity39 : just stay in the @entity6 team - then he ’ll break @entity78 's caps record by a long way			1
he ’s got a good chance of beating @entity78 if he plays for another three to four years			0
if he does n’t break it , it will be because of a horrible injury or a bizarre drop in form			0
@entity65 : playing deeper for @entity6 and the education from @entity204 will extend his career			1
he can ping long passes like @entity207 used to and still be a threat in the final third			0
he can do it better than @entity207 as he has extra pace			0
@entity12 : quite simply , he needs to keep scoring			0
there are very few players in the squad at the moment who look capable of scoring goals regularly at this level but @entity0 always has the belief that he will go out and hit the target			1
if , for some reason , the goals begin to dry up , that is when questions about his performances and what he is contributing to the team will become more relevant			0
@entity0 has 43 international goals and counting - six shy of @entity232 's record haul for @entity2 @entity6 manager @entity233 ( right ) holds the key to @entity0 's future playing position describe @entity0 ’s @entity2 career so far in three words @entity65 : committed , brilliant , chequered			1
@entity39 : breathtaking , madness , metatarsals			0
@entity12 : never , ever dull			0
after the dire goalless draw with @entity242 at the @entity243 , @entity0 shouted at fans via a tv cemera @entity0 laps up the adulation of the fans after scoring against @entity68 in the @entity51 in @entity52 in 2004 @entity248 hails ' special ' skipper @entity0			1
