facing a new enemy , the @entity0 has instituted new rules in carrying out airstrikes against the @entity4 in @entity5			0
last year , president @entity6 made a famous speech acknowledging civilian casualties in drone strikes for the first time , saying he would do his best to prevent though needless deaths in the future be instituting a new rule that would only allow attacks if there was a ' near certainty ' innocents would n't be hurt			1
he called it ' the highest standard we can meet '			0
but apparently that standard has been abandoned in @entity5 and @entity21 , where the @entity22 and its allies are now engaged in a fight against the savage terrorist group @entity25			1
this new policy was revealed a week after reports that a dozen women and children were killed by an errant @entity37 missile in the @entity5 town of @entity39			1
local boys inspecting the damage in the town on september 23 , above not the same : president @entity6 made a new policy on drone strikes in may 2013 , saying he would only allow the attacks if there was a ' near certainty ' civilians would not be injured			1
that policy is allegedly not in place in the latest airstrikes against @entity25 in @entity5 and @entity21			2

@entity61 said the ' near certainty ' standard was created for attacks ' outside areas of active hostilities ' which ' simply does not fit what we are seeing on the ground in @entity21 and @entity5 right now			2
' the revelation of this latest policy change comes after reports that a dozen civilians were killed by an errant @entity37 missile in the @entity5 village of @entity39 on september 23			1
the town in the @entity84 province is thought to be a stronghold for the @entity86 linked @entity87 , and @entity22 officials allegedly believed that members of the @entity92 terrorist group were there planning attacks			0

a @entity5 - backed rebel told the @entity104 late last week that a building for displaced people in the community may have accidentally been targeted @entity22 - backed @entity5 rebels told the @entity104 late last week that women and children were pulled from the rubble of a home for displaced civilians that may have been accidentally targeted in the strike			1
' they were carrying bodies out of the rubble			0
â€¦ i saw seven or eight ambulances coming out of there , ' said @entity121 , a political member of one of the @entity124 factions , who attended the @entity104 briefing			0
' we believe this was a big mistake			0
' however , @entity22 officials have not yet confirmed the civilian deaths			0
@entity61 said they are investigating the reports			0
it 's still unclear who ultimately signs off on the current airstrikes going on in @entity5 and @entity21 , but sources say they 've been relaxed and that more power has been given to commanders in the area to approve attacks			2
following president @entity6 's policy - changing speech last year , sources at the time reported that drone strikes would thereafter need presidential approval before being carried out			1
but apparently the new policy gives theater commanders more responsibility in selecting targets without as much presidential oversight .			0
