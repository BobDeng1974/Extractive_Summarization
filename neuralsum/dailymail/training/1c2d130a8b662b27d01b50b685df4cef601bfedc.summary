when the @entity1 take the field at @entity3 for their game on sunday against the @entity5 they ’ll hope to have homefield advantage despite being about 4,200 miles away from the @entity7			1
for the second game of the @entity10 they will play ‘ host ’ to the @entity5 on sunday afternoon			1
@entity1 ( 2 - 5 ) are very much the underdog with only one victory away from the @entity7 in the past two seasons			1
the @entity1 have lost four in a row after winning two of their first three games			0
meanwhile , the favoured @entity5 ( 5 - 2 ) have won their last two road games and are on the back of a two - game winning streak			1
@entity21 and @entity22 attend a play 60 event in @entity24 ahead of sunday 's game at @entity3 @entity26 has been struggling with an ankle injury and may miss out on @entity3 the @entity5 and @entity1 have played 35 times overall , including their first - ever meeting in 1966 , and @entity5 has won the lion ’s share of the match - ups with 23 victories			1
however , @entity1 has won the last three meetings between the teams and outscored @entity5 by a combined margin of 88 to 55			1
the tables might be turned on sunday as the @entity1 have struggled to score points this season under the leadership of head coach @entity22			1
this is the seventh season the 55 - year - old has been on the sidelines for the @entity1 and he has a 62 - 41 record overall			2
however , @entity22 has only won a single playoff game in four postseason appearances and there have been rumblings that his job is on the line			2
a win on sunday against the @entity52 leaders would certainly help his cause			2
@entity22 may be in luck because @entity5 all - pro wide receiver @entity26 is uncertain to suit up on sunday			1
@entity26 , who holds the @entity56 record for most receiving yards in a season with 1,964 , has been dealing with an ankle issue and has missed the past two games			2
if @entity26 is unable to go , it will be a big break for @entity63 ’s defense , a unit that has already surrendered 1,921 passing yards this year , second-most in the @entity56			0
when the teams take the field for @entity71 ’s first daytime @entity56 game it will be 9.30am eastern time in the @entity72			0
the early start time in the @entity74 means fans can watch the @entity56 morning , noon and night in four separate sunday timeslots			0
although the sunday morning kickoff may interfere with breakfast plans in @entity63 and @entity80 , the earlier start is not expected to affect attendance and the @entity5 and @entity1 will likely be playing in front of a packed house			2
@entity84 is second in the passing yards list , but @entity1 's season has been hamstrung by inconsistency the @entity5 ' offensive line has been a low point in an otherwise solid season the first @entity56 match - up at @entity3 in 2014 , which saw the @entity92 trounce the @entity93 38 - 14 , was played in front of 83,436 fans			1
tickets for sunday ’s game sold out quickly and the final 2014 @entity56 game at @entity3 on november 6 between the @entity99 and the @entity100 has already sold out as well			0
the @entity1 arrived at @entity101 on monday morning and will be practicing at the @entity102 this week			0
‘ good morning , @entity71			0
the @entity1 are here ! # @entity106 # @entity105 , ’ the team tweeted out on monday			0
@entity5 arrived earlier today and players and coaches from both teams will be participating in various functions including an @entity111 at 12.pm on saturday in @entity112			0
the rally , which drew more than 40,000 fans last year , will feature food , drink , music , dance acts and appearances by @entity121 players and other special guests .			0

*falcons* play host to the @entity5 at @entity3 with both sides needing a win
the @entity5 ( 5 - 2 ) lead the @entity52 and harbour play - off *aspirations*
but the @entity1 ( 2 - 5 ) are once again struggling after going 4 - 12 last season
head coach @entity22 is under *pressure* but new @entity5 coach @entity134 has started well
star receiver @entity26 is a doubt for the game with an ankle injury
