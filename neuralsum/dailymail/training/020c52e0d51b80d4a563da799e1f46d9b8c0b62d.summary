@entity0 scored his first goal for @entity2 and in doing so opened the way for @entity4 to rewrite the history books once again , with a hat - trick that took him past @entity8 as the @entity9 all - time top - scorer			1
@entity2 were struggling to break down a stubborn @entity12 defence when @entity0 spun away from his marker and buried a shot into the far corner of @entity17 's net after 27 minutes			1
it was the goal that lifted the weight of not having scored in his first five games from his shoulders … it also opened the @entity4 floodgates			2
last week @entity4 told @entity27 newspaper @entity25 he would like to stay at @entity2 for the rest of his career but that ' players do n't always get what they want '			1
what sane of mind president would sanction his sale after his latest landmark performances ? @entity2 forward @entity4 moved ahead of @entity8 in the @entity9 all - time scorers list , he is now the sole record holder @entity0 scored @entity2 's opening goal , it was also his first goal for the club since his £ 75million move from @entity43 @entity4 wheels away after scoring his first , and his club 's second goal of the evening against @entity12 in the @entity9 @entity4 scores his second goal of the evening while defender @entity48 , who was eventually sent off , watches on the @entity51 side 's two goal scorers celebrate together during their comfortable win against the @entity54 side @entity12 @entity17 5 , @entity55 6 , @entity56 5 , @entity57 6 , @entity58 6 ; @entity59 7 , @entity60 5 , @entity61 5 , @entity62 6 ; @entity63 5 , @entity64 6 red cards : @entity56 @entity2 @entity66 7 ; @entity67 8 , @entity68 7 , @entity69 7 , @entity70 8 ; @entity71 7 , @entity72 8 , @entity73 6 ; @entity0 8 , @entity4 9 , @entity74 7 goals : @entity0 , @entity4 ( 3 ) red cards : @entity73 the 27 - year - old is now @entity2 's all - time top scorer ; the @entity81 league 's all - time top scorer ; and the @entity9 's all - time top scorer , too			1
and such is the 27 - year - old 's genius that he has broken each one of those records by scoring a hat - trick			0
he bagged a treble against @entity88 last season to become the club 's all - time leading scorer ; he got three against @entity92 at the weekend to top @entity51 's all time list ; and he surpassed @entity8 's record 72 - goal haul with three more against the @entity54 champions			0
he moved past @entity96 legend @entity8 when he diverted a @entity70 shot past @entity12 keeper @entity17			0
he doubled his tally in the second half converting an @entity67 pass and then made it 4 - 0 from @entity74 's cross to put him on 74 goals in 91 games			1
the messi - show began after @entity0 broke down @entity12 's well - marshalled defence			1
their keeper @entity17 had saved from @entity4 after just two minutes and when @entity67 blasted over the keeper 's bar from distance on ten minutes it was a symptom of the visitors ' growing frustration			0
@entity0 spurned a glorious chance on 18 minutes when @entity4 wriggled down the right and crossed			0
but the former @entity43 striker had to get his shot away quickly in a packed area and it went tamely straight at @entity17			0
@entity4 then teed - up @entity121 with a perfectly lofted pass but the full - back sent his shot over from the edge of the six - yard box			0
@entity2 were enjoying over 70 per cent of possession but still could not find a way through			0
@entity69 , @entity73 and @entity72 run over to congratulate @entity4 after the three - time @entity129 winner broke the record in @entity54 @entity2 's players show their support for the @entity134 graduate , who was made captain for the night in @entity54 @entity136 breaks @entity8 goal - scoring record @entity2 midfielder @entity73 was sent off in the second half after picking up his second booking of the match former @entity143 defender @entity142 attempts to escape the attention of @entity12 's @entity63 @entity12 forward @entity64 jumps over @entity142 as he runs down the line at the @entity146 in the @entity54 capital then finally the breakthrough came as @entity0 turned away from his marker down the left - hand channel and finished into @entity17 's far corner			1
the tension lifted , both for him and his team - mates			0
@entity4 turned in @entity121 's shot to make it 2 - 0 and then back - heeled to @entity0 who went for power over precision and sent his shot wide			2
the @entity27 then chased 30 yards back to win possession as @entity2 finished the half strongly			2
he was in the mood for more goals and duly delivered them after the break , first from @entity67 ' pass and then after good work from @entity74			0
@entity4 also set up @entity0 who missed the chance to double his tally and when with 20 minutes @entity73 was harshly sent off , @entity0 was replaced by @entity169 as @entity170 looked to compensate for going a man down			1
@entity4 completed his hat - trick and not even a @entity67 booking – meaning he misses @entity2 's last group game at home to @entity176 – could ruin the night			1
@entity56 was later sent off for @entity12 as the home side failed to grab a consolation goal			2
@entity2 will miss their @entity180 full back in the last game that they have to win to qualify as group leaders			0
but , full of confidence after the final whistle , @entity0 said : ' we know how strong @entity187 [ @entity176 ] are but we are at home so it is in our hands to win the game and top the group			2
' @entity73 beats @entity12 midfielder @entity60 during their @entity9 clash on tuesday night @entity12 's @entity81 goalkeeper @entity17 pats @entity4 after gathering the ball in his box during the first half @entity12 's @entity57 challenges @entity195 forward @entity0 for the ball and slaps him in the mouth in the process @entity63 dribbles with the ball while @entity200 international @entity70 tracks back to try and tackle him @entity2 's @entity201 midfielder @entity71 finds himself in space early on in the game while defender @entity142 watches on @entity2 manager @entity170 shouts instructions to his team from the sidelines in @entity54 @entity2 's @entity81 forward @entity74 is challenged by @entity60 while @entity180 defender @entity56 looks on @entity12 fans light flares in the build up to the @entity9 clash at the @entity146 in the @entity54 capital the smoke caused by the home fans ' flares meant the game began under a shroud of smoke after using all their flares , @entity12 fans showed their support with their scarves and vocal cords			1
