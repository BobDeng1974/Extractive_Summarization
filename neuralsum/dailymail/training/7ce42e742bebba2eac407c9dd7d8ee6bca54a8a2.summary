by @entity0 from the mysterious decapitated heads of ‘ gladiators ’ unearthed in the @entity6 to human remains from the infamous ‘ @entity9 ’ psychiatric hospital , recent construction projects re-shaping @entity3 ’s skyline have revealed some unusual historical treasures			1
and now prehistoric remains that suggest the presence of a campsite for cavemen have been discovered on the building site of the new @entity17 @entity16 in @entity18 , @entity3			1
a palaeolithic flint tool pulled from the site could be one of the earliest objects found in @entity3 , dating from anywhere between @entity24 and @entity25			1
a palaeolithic flint tool ( pictured ) pulled from the construction site of the new @entity17 @entity16 could be one of the earliest objects found in @entity3 , dating from anywhere between 700,000 and @entity25 a palaeolithic flint tool could be one of the earliest objects found in @entity3 , dating from anywhere between 700,000 and @entity25			1
it could be a tool or a flake from a larger tool			0
charred remains suggest campfires , which could have been used at temporary sites ideally based for hunting and fishing			1
a fish trap was found measuring 39ft ( 12metres ) long			1
archaeologists discovered tools from the @entity44 - 10,000 to @entity45 – and @entity46 , between 4,000 and 2,600 years ago			0
charred remains suggesting campfires , animal bones and a fish trap were also identified			1
archaeologists from @entity52 ( @entity53 ) also discovered tools from the @entity55 to @entity45 – and @entity46 , between 4,000 and 2,600 years ago			0
the site in @entity3 , which is being developed to make way for the embassy as well as a whole host of new flats and buildings , was once a river consisting of smaller channels with sandy and gravelly islands in between			1
some of the islands were large enough and dry enough for prehistoric people to settle on			2
the fertile , marshy banks provided access to rich food sources and were a perfect hunting ground for prehistoric communities			2
charred remains suggest campfires , which could have been used at temporary sites ideally based for hunting and fishing			1
these wooden posts might have been part of a fish trap used to catch dinner 11,000 years ago prehistoric remains that suggest the presence of a campsite for cavemen have been discovered on the building site of the new @entity17 @entity16 in @entity18 , south @entity3 ( marked on this map ) the etymology of @entity3 is uncertain but it is thought that it is @entity89 in origin , despite evidence of prehistoric settlements stretching back thousands more years			1
the first recording of the name @entity95 dates from the second century			0
there was a theory that it originated from a ' @entity99 ' but this has been discarded			0
historians in the @entity102 maintained that the city 's name is @entity105 and means ' place belonging to a man called @entity108 , ' but again , this theory has been thrown out			0
in 1998 @entity110 suggested that @entity3 is pre-celtic for ( p ) lowonida - ' river too wide to ford ' - suggesting that it is named after the @entity114			2
it could have a @entity116 and @entity89 origin			0
until 1889 the name ' @entity3 ' only applied to the @entity118 , which was the @entity89 part of the city , but it now applies to the county and @entity122			2
the flint itself could be a tool in its own right or a ‘ flake ’ from a larger tool and was probably swept away by water , making it difficult for experts to date the find precisely , @entity132 reported			2
other discoveries on the site include a prehistoric fish trap , approximately 39ft ( 12metres ) long , and evidence of camp fires , demonstrated by scorched patches of earth and burned bones			1
‘ we think that [ the fires ] are potentially marking a spot that people were coming back to seasonally , ’ @entity145 , a senior archaeologist at @entity53			0
she believes that the ancient site was probably too wet to be a permanent settlement for ancient people , but the open space might have proved a good camp site from which to hunt and go fishing for food			0
‘ what we have found may be the earliest archaeological evidence currently known from @entity3 , ’ ‘ it will be interesting to see how this evidence relates to other prehistoric structures on the nearby @entity114 foreshore			2
' we hope to be able to reconstruct and have a better understanding of the prehistoric landscape of a much wider area than at present			0
’ the flint tools are a rare discovery in @entity3 as the city has seen so much development that fleeting glimpses of prehistoric people rarely survive			2
dr @entity145 thinks they were made between 100,000 and 12,000 years ago			0
experts will analyse the tools to establish firm dates and work out what they may have been used for , to paint a picture of life in @entity3 over 12,000 years ago			0
prehistoric remains that suggest the presence of a campsite for cavemen have been discovered on the building site of the new @entity17 @entity16 in @entity18 , south @entity3			1
this visualisation shows where the modern building ( pictured towards the bottom right in a grass circle ) will sit among the new development			0

a palaeolithic flint tool could be one of the earliest objects found in @entity3 , dating from between 700,000 and @entity25
tool was found on the construction site of the new @entity17 @entity16 in @entity18
charred remains suggesting a campfire , animal bones and a possible fish trap were also found , hinting at a temporary campsite used for hunting
site in south @entity3 was once a *series* of water channels coming off a river with sandy islands in between - home to prehistoric communities
