@entity2 cod stocks are bouncing back after being heavily overfished for decades and could even be sustainable in five years , new research has found			1
the population was deemed healthy in hundreds of the northern @entity6 fisheries analysed and experts say the fish is closer to being certified as a sustainable species			1
consumers were previously told to eat gurnard instead of cod after stocks plummeted in the 1980s and 1990s , but the industry has steadily recovered since regulations were put in place in 2006			1
@entity2 cod stocks are on the rise after being heavily overfished and could be sustainable in five years however the findings by @entity19 and the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) revealed that one in nine fisheries operate sustainably , with 400 suffering from serious failings in data management			1
the exact cod stock figures remain unknown due to a severe lack of scientific data on the number of fish caught every year , according to the @entity29			2
dr @entity30 , technical director at industry - funded @entity19 , which represents the seafood industry , told the paper he was surprised at how close the @entity2 cod is to being certified			1
he said : ' i would like to think within a decade we will have @entity20 - certified @entity2 cod. i would like to put it closer â€“ where within five years it could look at entering the system			1
' cod stocks plummeted in the 1980s and 1990s , but the industry has steadily recovered since regulations were put in place in 2006 the findings by @entity19 and the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) did reveal however that one in nine fisheries operate sustainably , with 400 suffering from serious failings in data management although eight out of nine fisheries fell short dr @entity30 remains optimistic , adding : ' it 's a question of glass half full or half empty			1
trawling in the @entity2 saw catches grow each year until the 1980s , with figures for cod peaking at 300,000 tonnes in the 1970s			1
various regulations were put in place to protect the stocks of fish , including limited fishing times and limited numbers of fishing boats			2
but these rules were never systematically enforced and did not bring much relief			0
after the @entity62 joined the @entity63 , which introduced the @entity64 , the problem of overfishing was steadily brought under control			0
numbers fell to below 70,000 tonnes for the first time in 1999 and reached its lowest level of 28,900 tonnes in 2006			0
a report in 2012 suggested that there were only 100 adult cod , which become more fertile as they age , left in the @entity2			1
researchers warned a lower life expectancy meant a lower birth rate and a faster decline			0
but in 2013 the first signs of recovery started to show as the @entity20 recognised cod could be on track for certification			2
' we are looking at it as glass half full because we now have an action plan			0
we would have been in the dark without this research			0
' the research included 450 inshore fisheries , which were assessed against the criteria set out by the @entity20 to be considered for its ' blue flash ' logo			1
this logo is seen as an indicator for consumers that the seafood comes from sustainable fisheries			0
@entity99 , country manager at the @entity20 , said the report highlights a ' lack of clarity ' on who was responsible for maintaining the fisheries as too many fell between different authorities			2
the @entity106 ( @entity106 ) said it recognises stocks are recovering and that there are ' positive signs ' but still regards it as a species to avoid			0
the @entity106 still lists cod caught in the @entity2 as ' fish to avoid ' , rating it at level 5			2
it explains that stock levels in the @entity2 have declined from a peak of 250,000 tonnes in the early 1970s to their current level of around 70,000 tonnes			2
@entity119 cod is listed by @entity120 ( @entity121 of the @entity119 ) as a threatened and declining species and by @entity123 ( @entity123 ) as vulnerable in the @entity124 and @entity125			0
' the efforts of fishers and managers through the @entity130 , and the fact that there is a long term management plan in place , are very positive moves and will hopefully see the fishery continue to recover in the coming years , ' it says			0
the @entity106 puts forward a recommended list of fish we can eat ... the @entity106 list of fish to avoid :			0

@entity2 cod populations are healthy in hundreds of fisheries analysed
stocks plummeted in 1980s and 1990s but industry has steadily recovered
research was carried out by @entity19 and the @entity20
however it also found only one in nine fisheries are operating sustainably
