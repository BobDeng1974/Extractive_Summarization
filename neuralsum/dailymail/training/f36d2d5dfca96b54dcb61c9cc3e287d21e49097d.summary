a bullying paramedic who let down one of the tyres on her ambulance to dodge an emergency call - out has been struck off			1

@entity35 chairman @entity34 said : ‘ the registrant ’s actions on more than one occasion of causing an otherwise sound ambulance to be taken off the road for entirely selfish reasons had the potential to put patients at risk			0
‘ there was very little evidence that the registrant had shown insight into the possible impact of her conduct on patients who might have suffered as a consequence of the ambulances being off the road			2
’ @entity24 , who did not attend the hearing at @entity57 in @entity58 , admitted letting a tyre down 30 minutes before the end of her shift on may 19 , 2009 , to avoid treating the elderly woman in @entity64 , @entity65			1
allegation : @entity24 used a pen to deflate the nearside front tyre of the ambulance , the @entity14 heard during the trust ’s internal investigation , she admitted : ‘ i untwiddled the valve cap and with my pen i let a little air out of the tyre			0
‘ i told control we had a slow flat			0
i did n’t tell anyone about this			0

‘ they also involved student paramedics for whom the registrant was responsible while they were in her charge			0

‘ her conduct in bullying her colleagues demonstrated , in the panel ’s view , a deep - seated attitudinal problem about which the registrant appeared to have virtually no insight			1
‘ we saw at first hand the very profound effect which her conduct still has on those of her colleagues who gave evidence at this hearing			2
