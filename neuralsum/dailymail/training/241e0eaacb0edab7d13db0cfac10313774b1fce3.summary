by @entity0 published : 14:45 est , 27 august 2013 updated : 14:45 est , 27 august 2013 for a @entity2 climbing challenge that goes a bit beyond the natural beauty of the @entity5 , look no further than the train			0
visitors to @entity8 could be able to don hard hats and carabinas to scale one of the most iconic monuments in the country - the @entity15 railway bridge			1
@entity16 is planning to offer guided tours to the top of the bridge in time for its 125th anniversary in 2015			1
all aboard : an artist 's impression of the visitor centre designed by @entity16 to act as a start point for tours of the @entity15 railway bridge groups of 15 people would be taken from @entity28 along an existing walkway under the approach span close to @entity31			1
wearing the requisite safety gear , they would climb to the top of the south tower , where a small bridge has been proposed			1
the railway authority has also proposed a second concept for less adventurous climbers that includes a visitors ' centre and viewing platform linked by a lift on the north side , which would take groups to the top of one of the towers more than 100 metres above the @entity49			1
a video outlining the proposals suggests a glass - ceiling centre could be tucked under the massive steel structure at @entity54 , opening up a ' cathedral - like ' view above			0
the proposals would costs an estimated Â£ 12 - 15 million to deliver and could be ' partially realised ' within two years , @entity16 said			2
going up : a lift would link the visitors ' centre and viewing platform to the north side of the bridge to scale : a second plan would allow visitors to do more challenging walks from a smaller base to the top of the south tower @entity68 , route managing director at the rail authority , said : ' after 10 years spent restoring the bridge to its full glory , and in advance of the application for world heritage listing , these plans will offer the public the chance to visit the bridge and see it close - up for the first time			1
' we are hugely excited by these proposals and believe that they have the potential to be developed into an important new visitor attraction for @entity2			0
' @entity16 said the visitor attraction could be developed without any serious changes to ' the well loved view of the bridge '			2
it said the bridge would remain a key part of the railway service , with any profits going to fund its upkeep			0
the forth railway bridge carries more than 200 trains a day between @entity8 and @entity95			2
masterpiece : designers sir @entity97 and @entity99 wanted the bridge to look indestructible rights of passage : the bridge provided the first non-ferry link between @entity8 and @entity95 , linking key cities such as @entity105 iconic : hrh @entity106 , @entity107 , added the final rivet to the structure when it opened on 4 march 1890 along with the @entity111 , it provides the key link between the capital and northern @entity2 , including key cities such as @entity105			0
mr @entity68 said : ' we are committed to working with communities , local authorities and relevant government bodies to develop plans that have a sustainable positive impact on the area			0
' while we expect that visitor numbers will be high , we 're committed to encouraging as many of those visitors as possible to travel by rail and we will develop plans alongside train operators to incentivise that option			0
' transport minister @entity128 , speaking on behalf of the @entity127 , said : ' i welcome @entity16 's exciting and ambitious plans to combine an historic and vital part of @entity2 's transport network with a breath - taking attraction for visitors to enjoy			2
