by @entity0 published : 13:46 est , 18 january 2013 updated : 15:01 est , 18 january 2013 he 's strutted his stuff on the catwalk wearing everything from wedding dresses to transparent t - shirts and now @entity7 can add onesies to the list			2
the androgynous @entity12 - @entity11 model sported a clinging onesie on the catwalk during @entity15 's show at @entity16 last night			1
although @entity7 is famous for being the world 's only male model to specialise in womenswear , that has n't stopped him from taking part in the continuing round of menswear shows			1
all for one : @entity7 ( left ) wears a pinstriped onesie on the catwalk at @entity15 multi-talented : although @entity7 usually focuses on womenswear , here he proves he can turn his hand to both wearing masculine suits , trousers and shirts - as well as that onesie - the model has already appeared on the runway at @entity15 and @entity35 , with three more days of @entity16 left to go			1
@entity36 and with his long , blond hair slicked back , the model looked far more manly than usual			0
he even sported a super-sized moustache during the @entity35 show , which left him almost unrecognisable			0
despite his foray into menswear , @entity7 remains a favourite of womenswear designers , having starred in multiple campaigns , including for @entity46 womenswear			2
it was recently revealed that the model 's envy - inducing bone structure was inherited from his mother , whose photograph he posted on his @entity53 account last week			0
the 1970s image showed a blonde , slender woman with the same fine features as her son			0
thanks goodness for excellent genes			0
doing it like a dude : a barefaced @entity7 on the catwalk with not a dress - or a pair of heels - in sight macho man : @entity7 appears uncharacteristically manly in his @entity15 overcoat and @entity35 faux ' tache ( right ) back to the day job ? @entity7 's manly new look is a far cry from his usual made - up style			1

@entity12 - @entity11 @entity75 is the world 's only male model to specialise in womenswear
he appeared in a pin - striped onesie on the catwalk at @entity15
*unusually* , the model has also appeared in *traditional* menswear including a sharp two - piece suit
