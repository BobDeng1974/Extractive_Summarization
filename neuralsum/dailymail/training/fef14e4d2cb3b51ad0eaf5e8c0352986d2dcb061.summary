until the execution of his stunning strike to set @entity3 on their way to a first victory of 2015 , @entity0 had done precious little since his arrival in the @entity7 to justify a £ 12million price tag			1
in fact , you wondered if a decimal point had been omitted from the fee which brought the @entity14 midfielder to @entity15 from @entity16 in the summer			0
there was one farcical moment before his goal which comically captured @entity0 ’s struggle , attempting a double step - over only to trip on the ball and watch as it rolled to team - mate @entity25 – it was his first completed pass of the afternoon			1
@entity3 midfielder @entity26 leaps with joy after rounding off a brilliant away victory with a third goal of the afternoon at the @entity30 @entity26 celebrates with team - mates after extending @entity3 's lead in the 78th minute against @entity33 @entity26 's low drive took a wicked deflection off @entity33 defender @entity36 to wrong - foot goalkeeper @entity37 @entity25 let fly from almost 30 yards as the @entity3 forward made it 2 - 0 shortly after the half - time interval @entity25 is congratulated by his team - mates after the striker makes it 2 - 0 to @entity3 five minutes into the second half @entity3 midfielder @entity0 slides on his knees in celebration after opening the scoring against @entity33 at the @entity47 @entity33 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity37 5.5 ; @entity36 6 , @entity48 6 , @entity49 6 , @entity50 5.5 ( @entity51 71 , 5.5 ) ; @entity52 5 ( @entity53 55 , 5.5 ) , @entity54 5.5 , @entity55 5.5 , @entity56 6.5 ; @entity57 5 , @entity58 5 ( @entity59 67 , 6 ) subs not used : @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 booked : @entity52 24 , @entity36 45 manager : @entity61 5 @entity3 : @entity66 6 ; @entity67 6 , @entity68 6 , @entity69 6 , @entity70 7 ; @entity71 6 , @entity72 6.5 ; @entity25 7 ( @entity73 90 ) , @entity74 7 , @entity75 7.5 ( @entity26 72 , 6 ) ; @entity76 6 ( @entity77 82 ) subs not used : @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity73 , @entity82 scorer ( s ) : @entity0 40 , @entity25 50 , @entity26 78 booked : @entity72 29 manager : @entity85 7 referee : @entity87 man of the match : @entity0 attendance : 23,925 @entity25 doubled @entity3 's lead - click here for more from @entity93 but talent clearly resides within the slight - of - frame playmaker and that much was evident from his opening goal , an uncompromising drill from outside the penalty area to mark his first for the club			1
@entity25 added an equally sumptuous second after half - time and substitute @entity26 capped a fine maiden win for interim head coach @entity85 , who still harbours ambition of landing the role on a permanent basis			1
results like this will certainly help , as will transforming the fortunes of @entity0			1
‘ i said to him before the game , “ i know you have got ability , start doing something for me , give me a goal ” , ’ revealed @entity85 , who was this week confirmed as boss until the end of the season			2
‘ i ’m so pleased for him			0
his all - round performance was excellent and it ’s a great finish for the goal			1
‘ he will get stronger and fitter			0
it ’s hard coming from another league into the @entity7 and there will be bad days , that ’s what happens with flair players			0
‘ but the best is definitely still to come from him and we saw what he is capable of today			0
’ the @entity14 international let fly with a powerful left - footed striker from the edge of the area after 40 minutes @entity0 points at himself after giving the away side the lead in the first half as team - mate @entity25 chases the goalscorer @entity0 is joined by @entity25 and @entity71 as they celebrate in front of the travelling @entity3 supporters @entity36 had a goal disallowed after clearly punching the ball past @entity66 , picking up yellow card for his troubles the @entity33 defender clearly raised his arm above his head before knocking the ball in with his hand @entity150 - style @entity36 runs off in celebration as @entity0 screams for handball before the goal is eventually ruled for @entity33 boss @entity61 – a sodden and saddened figure amid a second - half snow flurry – the outlook is bleak			1
his team remain in the relegation zone , have lost four on the spin and are without a goal in six hours			2
he hopes to bring in @entity164 striker @entity162 and @entity166 winger @entity165 before monday ’s deadline , and admits his team are slipping into a perilous position			0
‘ this is when you earn your money as a manager , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s my job to lift the players who are a bit shell shocked			0
i need to wake the players up because we ’re in serious trouble			0
’ @entity61 ’s cause is hardly aided by the generosity of his sorry side			0
they started brightly and had shaded the opening half before @entity50 , the @entity184 left back , gifted possession to @entity0			1
accepting the errant pass 25 yards from goal , @entity0 duly dropped a shoulder to fashion space for the shot and located the bottom corner with unerring accuracy			1
such is @entity33 ’s desperation right now that @entity36 then tried his damnedest to replicate @entity150 ’s infamous handball goal , albeit minus the @entity197 ’s subtlety and cunning			2
the @entity199 ’s hand was a good foot above his head when he punched home @entity203 ’s deadball delivery			1
somehow , referee @entity87 missed what was a blatant offence and it took the intervention of the fourth official to chalk the goal off			2
@entity76 takes control of possession as @entity33 defender @entity48 closes down the @entity3 striker @entity203 buries his face into the turf after missing a chance for @entity33 during saturday 's clash despondent @entity33 players wait to restart the game as they fell to their fourth straight defeat in all competitions without even scoring a goal the win was @entity3 's first of 2015 and a first for manager @entity85 since taking over from @entity223 in december last year @entity61 braves the rain as he issues instructions to his players from the touchline during the @entity7 defeat @entity61 said : ‘ we ’re struggling at the moment but we do n’t want to see goals scored like that – thankfully , the officials got it right			1
but i do n’t think it was cheating , more just a reaction because he could n’t reach the ball with his head			2
’ @entity61 was wrong on that , @entity36 had cheated – his celebration and subsequent protest proved as much			0
but there was no doubting the legitimacy of @entity3 ’s second five minutes after half - time			1
again @entity33 were complicit in the concession – @entity203 passing straight to @entity25 – but the winger deserves all of the credit , striding forward and smashing beyond a helpless @entity37 from fully 30 yards			1
@entity33 were n’t the only ones guilty of some suicidal defending and @entity68 ’s blushes were spared when his horribly sliced clearance was headed from the line by @entity253			0
embarrassment was a recurring theme and just moments later @entity33 forward @entity57 , unmarked in front of an open goal , failed to adjust his feet in time to turn home @entity203 ’s cross			1
if @entity57 had converted then perhaps @entity33 might have salvaged an unlikely point			0
but any hope of rescuing something from the game went when @entity26 saw his 12 - yard shot deflected up and over @entity37 on 78 minutes			1
@entity85 and @entity0 were the last two off the pitch at the end , celebrating in front of the 2,500 travelling fans			2
and the @entity3 boss reflected : ‘ it was a great feeling and i ’m so pleased with performance			2
‘ we really grew in confidence and starting keeping the ball after the first goal and were excellent , it was a performance i ’ve seen coming			2
‘ i want this job			0
everyone now knows i ’m the head coach			0
’ victories like this will do his chances no harm at all .			0

@entity0 opened the scoring after 40 minutes with a superb left foot drive from the edge of the box
@entity290 had a goal disallowed on the stroke of half - time after he punched the ball past @entity66
@entity25 doubled @entity3 's lead five minutes into the second half , scoring from all of 30 yards
@entity26 *increased* the lead further on 78 minutes after his deflected strike beat @entity37
