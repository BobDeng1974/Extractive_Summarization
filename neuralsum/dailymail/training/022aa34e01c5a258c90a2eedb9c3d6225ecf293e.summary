@entity0 had become increasingly breathless as she strolled around the ancient city of @entity3 , @entity0 expected to be overwhelmed by her surroundings			1
but all she could focus on was her breathlessness , and how she simply could n't seem to get enough air into her lungs			1
this was n't the first time the 61 - year - old from @entity12 , @entity13 , had found herself out of puff			1
for the past few months , she 'd become increasingly breathless , especially at work , while rushing about in her job as a restaurant manager			1
initially , she had blamed this on the fact she was overweight , but on that holiday in @entity23 last march , the mother - of - two realised it must be more serious			0
back home , her gp referred her for an echocardiogram , where ultrasound is used to examine the heart 's structure , and an angiogram , an x-ray where a special dye is injected into the blood to check the arteries of the heart			2
the tests revealed that @entity38 was suffering from heart failure			1
this affects about 800,000 @entity41 , and occurs when the heart muscle becomes damaged and weakened , and blood is no longer pumped around the body properly			2
this triggers breathlessness and fatigue as well as swelling in the feet and ankles ( fluid accumulates as the heart is no longer able to pump it around the body , and gravity causes it to pool here )			2
the most common causes of heart failure include high blood pressure , heart disease , a previous heart attack , heart rhythm disorders such as atrial fibrillation or faulty heart valves			1
treatments involve medications such as @entity66 inhibitors and beta blockers to lower blood pressure and regulate heart rate			0
@entity38 has a new type of heart failure that predominantly affects women and unfortunately there are few treatment options			1
that is because this type of heart failure does n't cause the heart to become enlarged , as is typical , but instead causes it to stiffen and shrink			1
with a healthy heart , with every heartbeat the two large ' pumping ' chambers of the heart - the ventricles - contract forcefully , propelling blood out to the body and lungs			2
this surge of blood is what we feel as our pulse			0
between each heartbeat the ventricles rapidly relax , allowing them to fill with blood ready for the next heart beat			0
with heart failure , typically the heart muscle thickens in an effort to create more power to pump blood around the body - but while this sounds helpful , the increase in size actually makes the heart less efficient at pumping blood , and so further exacerbates symptoms			1
doctors often diagnose heart failure when a heart appears large on a scan			1
but doctors now know that not all cases cause the heart to enlarge			0
she was suffering from new type of heart failure which causes the organ to stiffen and shrink in fact , in some cases the heart stays the same size or shrinks , explains dr @entity123 , consultant cardiologist at the @entity124 , @entity13			1
' over the past decade , it 's become apparent that a large proportion of people arriving at hospital with heart failure do n't have enlarged hearts , ' says dr @entity123 , who is also a @entity132 senior lecturer at @entity133			1
these patients have a different type of heart failure , where the ventricles become stiff and so ca n't relax between beats			1
they 're unable to fill properly with blood , so less blood is pumped around the body			0
the exact reason for this stiffening is unknown , but it 's thought that a mesh of scar tissue , triggered by damage from conditions such as high blood pressure , diabetes or obesity , forms between the muscle cells of the heart			0
this stiffness causes the heart to appear smaller ( though both types of heart failure trigger the same symptoms )			1
and because it seems to affect women more than men , particularly older women , some experts refer to it informally as ' old lady heart syndrome '			2
' it sums up the type of patient affected - female , over- 70 and also often with a history of high blood pressure , ' explains @entity171 , a cardiologist from @entity172 in @entity173 , @entity174			0
why this condition affects more women is unknown , though the menopause may play a role as this triggers a drop in oestrogen , a hormone that helps protect the heart			2
the classic form of heart failure ( previously known as systolic heart failure but now called heart failure with reduced ejection fraction - @entity187 ) was thought to be by far the most usual , but doctors realise that this newer type may be much more common than once thought			1
' in one @entity192 study involving 12,000 patients with heart failure , a third were found to have the type of heart failure where the heart is not enlarged			1
the strong risk predictors for this were found to be ageing , being a woman and a history of high blood pressure or diabetes , ' says dr @entity123			0
' in july , we reviewed the admissions of heart failure patients from eight @entity13 hospitals and the surrounding area and found one in five had this type of heart failure			1
' some estimates suggest that , for some unknown reason , the condition - known as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction , or @entity215 - is rising at a greater rate than classic heart failure			1
last year , @entity192 doctors , writing in the @entity220 , said : ' among elderly women living in the community , @entity215 comprises nearly 90 per cent of new heart failure cases			1
' but despite warnings that the condition is on the rise , it may still not be diagnosed , says dr @entity171			0
' if you 're not a cardiologist interested or aware of this condition , you may just miss it			0
' a new treatment to destroy nerves around the kidney is being trialled this stems from how heart failure is detected			1
doctors use an echocardiogram to calculate the percentage of blood in the heart that is pumped out with each beat			0
this is called the ejection fraction , and is thought to be around 55 - 65 per cent in a healthy person			0
however , dr @entity123 says experts are realising that ejection fraction is a crude measure of heart function			0
furthermore , while ejection fraction is reduced in classic heart failure , it is normal in the newer type of heart failure , leading to patients wrongly being told their hearts are healthy			1
although the tests suggested that the amount of blood was being pumped out of the heart was normal , their overall heart function is impaired , leading to breathlessness			0
' when a patient is found to have a heart that is a normal size and with a normal ejection fraction , they may be told their breathlessness is n't their heart , ' says dr @entity123			2
he believes that patients with suspected heart failure should have their heart stiffness calculated by using an echocardiogram to measure how much the heart contracts with each beat , as well as a blood test that tests for levels of a substance called natriuretic peptide , which helps give an indication of heart function			2
for reasons that are largely unknown , none of the treatments that works in classic heart failure works in @entity215			2
however , reducing salt intake has been shown to be beneficial explains dr @entity171 , as it helps lower blood pressure			0
' @entity192 cardiologists say they see a big surge after @entity292 , because elderly women with this condition have been eating salty snacks , which raises blood pressure and makes their symptoms worse			0
' doctors are trialling a new treatment at the @entity124 using high frequency energy waves to destroy nerves around the kidney			1
it seems these nerves mistakenly tell the brain to send the body into ' emergency mode ' , which increases heart rate and raises blood pressure , placing even greater strain on the heart			2
the theory is that cutting off certain nerve signals will improve heart failure symptoms in both types of the condition			2
the trial is due to be published next year , but early results are promising			0
if they prove positive , a larger , placebo - controlled study will follow			0
@entity38 underwent the hour - long procedure as part of the trial in august , under local anaesthetic			0
within a month her breathlessness had improved			0
' even opening the car door would leave me tired			0
now i 'm back to my old self			0

@entity0 , 61 , from @entity12 , had become increasingly breathless
felt she simply could n't seem to get enough air into her lungs
she was suffering from new type of heart failure
it causes organ to stiffen and shrink and predominantly affects women
she underwent new treatment to destroy nerves around the kidney
