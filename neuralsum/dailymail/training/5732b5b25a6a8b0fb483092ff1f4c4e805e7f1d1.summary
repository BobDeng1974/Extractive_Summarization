by @entity0 published : 03:40 est , 9 january 2013 updated : 03:40 est , 9 january 2013 very few jobs come with the following requirement : make toddlers cry			1
but they do if you 're @entity5 and your job is playing the baddie in the touring production of @entity10 on ice			1
' it 's brilliant fun being captain hook , ' the ice skater told @entity16			1
' as a villain you can get away with a lot more than playing a good guy			2
' i loved @entity36 when i was a child , so it 's terrific performing in it now			2
it 's wonderful to hear all the little kids doing the " tic - tocs " with the crocodile 's clock , and seeing their smiling faces light up when all the characters come onto the ice			1
of course , they 're not meant to smile when they see me ! ' @entity31 explained that the trickiest part of his job is switching between the roles of different @entity10 characters , changing skating styles to portray different characters			1
' as well as performing captain hook , i also play @entity58 in @entity59			1
he 's a bit of a surfer dude so i whizz around the rink more , whereas @entity27 's skating style is a lot sharper and rougher			2
' @entity67 , @entity27 's costume itself is very demanding because it 's so heavy - the heaviest one on the tour - which means that i actually ca n't physically jump or spin while i 'm wearing it			2
' it makes sword - fighting on ice pretty tricky - especially since we use real swords so they 're also really heavy			1
' @entity75 and @entity76 performing in @entity10 on ice happily , @entity31 has never skated off the ice with more than the odd finger injury			1
a cut here , a graze there			2
though there was once a slippery situation with a crocodile ... ' i 've had a few falls - in a live show anything can happen - my best one was once when i was being chased by the crocodile and i 'm meant to jump into the audience onto a stairwell - but i tripped and fell face - first into them			0
luckily i did n't fall on any small children			0
' and being familiar with grueling training sessions , @entity31 also had a few words of advice for the contestants on the new series of @entity100			0
' do n't get worried about the audience - try to forget there are people watching otherwise you 'll have falls			0
' i always get pre-match nerves			0
not as bad as when i first started , but there 's always a little fear in your minds			0
and i do n't have any superstitions at all - i think it 's best not to , otherwise you 'll panic			0
' ( sadly , his wisdom comes a little too late for @entity116 , who exited the show after just one episode following a fall and a slippery wardrobe malfunction			0
) ' i 'd love to do @entity100 , ' @entity31 added			0
' it would be great			0
i think any other sportsperson would be a good partner - they 'd be pretty flexible - but really i 'd like to be partnered with @entity124 , because i love her a little too much ! ' the characters of @entity59 perform during the production of @entity127 @entity5 , left , who plays captain hook in @entity10 on ice , says his dream partner for @entity100 would be actress @entity124 , right flounder and @entity132 in the @entity134 section of @entity10 on ice @entity10 returns this spring in select @entity136 cities with @entity137 ! visit www.disneyonice.co.uk for details .			1
