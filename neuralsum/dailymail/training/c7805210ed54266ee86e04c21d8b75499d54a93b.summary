this year 's mass emergence of mayflies in the @entity2 was one for the record books			1
the annual swarm rose above @entity5 , @entity6 from the river on sunday evening in a dark cloud so dense it caused a three - car roadway collision , blacked out the sun and even lit up area weather radar			1
the nuisance occurrence always causes headaches but experts say this year 's swarm was bigger than normal , though like every year the insects die off just as quickly as they emerge			1
while millions of protein and fat - filled bugs dying off is great news for fish -- and , later , fishermen -- the news is not so good for drivers			1
in addition to the swarm briefly darkening out the sun this year , the less fortunate mayflies that find themselves smashed on the road become a thick , oily sludge that can and does lead to car accidents			1
the @entity47 reports that a @entity6 road became so slick from the mayflies sunday evening it caused at least one of the drivers involved in a three - car crash to lose control of her vehicle			1
they also noted the limited visibility at the time of the crash			0
two people were injured in the crash , but only one person was taken to a local hospital			1
the problem has been so serious in the past that authorities have had to dump sand onto roadways and bridges to improve traction , much like salt and sand are used in the snowy months			0
one of the most striking things about this year 's @entity2 emergence was its marked radar echo			1
like a freak rainstorm in reverse , the emergence began to show up as a raucous blue and green around @entity5 at about 8:45 on sunday			2
the mayflies quickly moved along with a northerly wind up the @entity2 and appeared on radar screens just as a light - moderate rainfall might , according to @entity83			1
over the course of around three hours , the radar faded as the mayflies spread out			0
by midnight , they were all but gone			0
and by no later than tuesday , they were all dead , having mating and laying eggs to ensure next year 's hatch			1
left behind , of course , are their millions of gossamer bodies , piled in heaps along the riverbank , in parking lots and on porches and all over businesses and homes			0
dangerous ? this year 's emergence of the little bugs took place sunday evening and quickly enveloped the @entity2 town , even causing car accidents gross : the nuisance bugs cover just about everything once they emerge and nearby residents are warned to cover their mouths and noses slick conditions : a car accident involving three vehicles was reported this year after the protein and fat - rich bugs created a greasy mush on the road			1
no serious injuries were reported , however authorities are sometimes forced to use sand on the roads , much as they do during the snowy months , to prevent accidents caused by the greasy bug slicks messy : the bugs are a blessing for hungry wildlife but a curse for home and business owners who have to deal with the aftermath over the course of around three hours , the radar faded as the mayflies spread out			1
by midnight , they were all but gone			0
and by no later than tuesday , they were all dead , having mating and laying eggs to ensure next year 's hatch			1
left behind , of course , are their millions of gossamer bodies , piled in heaps along the riverbank , in parking lots and on porches and all over businesses and homes			0
the mayfly ( ephemera ) looks innocent enough ... when there 's just one while the bugs are large and can be a nuisance , people are urged not to kill them because they omit an unpleasant fishy odor when squashed			2
mayflies are an important source of nutrition for many species , including a wide variety of fish and birds			2
they ’re an annoyance because they stick to clothes and sometimes land in hair			0
however , they do not bite humans			0
the mayfly population goes through cycles , said @entity172 , a researcher at the @entity173 in @entity174 , @entity175			0
some years they come earlier than others			0
this year along the @entity2 the emergence came later than usual , possibly due to earlier flooding			2
mayflies typically live for a day or two before dying			2
but the life cycle actually lasts two years			0
mayflies begin as eggs on the water ’s surface before the eggs sink to the bottom of the lake			2
the larvae hatch and burrow into the mud			0
later , they wriggle out of their burrows and take off from the water			0
die - off : the bugs die off and pile up in clumps after just a day or so , creating heaps of insect carcasses to clean up it 's a good thing ? the mayflies are annoying but indicate a healthy waterway			1
they also make the environment even more vibrant by feeding hungry fish			2

the mayflies were concentrated near @entity5 , @entity6 , often a focal point for annual swarms
their crushed bodies make roadways greasy - this year 's @entity2 caused at least one car accident
two people were injured in the crash and one was taken to the hospital
the species , *hexagenia* *bilineata* , is a positive sign for water quality within the @entity2 and a feast for sport fish
just as quickly as they emerge , the bugs die off in about a day after mating
