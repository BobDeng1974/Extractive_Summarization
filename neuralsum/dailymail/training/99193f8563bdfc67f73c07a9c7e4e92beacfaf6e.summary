by @entity0 thousands of women in their forties will be offered statins under new guidelines drawn up by heart experts			1
middle - aged adults with unhealthy lifestyles will be routinely prescribed the drugs to prevent heart attacks and strokes in 20 years ’ time			1
statins are usually given only to patients with heart disease , or those very likely to develop it within ten years , based on their family history or unhealthy lifestyle			1
they cost only 10p a day and are mainly taken by the over- 65s			0
preventative : statins are usually given only to patients at great risk of heart attacks , but new guidance may change this but guidance drawn up by charities including the @entity28 and the @entity29 advises treating anyone at high risk of having a stroke or heart attack any time in their lives			1
it is based on a computer calculator which works out patients ’ lifetime risk of heart disease based on their family history , blood pressure , cholesterol , whether they smoke , where they live , ethnicity and age			1
the advice will mean younger patients in their forties and fifties – and in some cases thirties – with a high lifetime risk are now deemed eligible			2
crucially , it will lead to more women being offered the drugs			0
they tend to develop heart disease on average ten years later than men , which means they are not usually deemed to be at high risk under the current advice			1
risk : experts have said that prescribing the drug earlier can bring greater benefits over a lifetime around 7million @entity65 take statins , which work by lowering cholesterol and preventing fatty deposits building up in the arteries			2
experts can not say how many more will be offered the drugs as a result of these new guidelines but they will become commonly taken among younger age groups			0
the guidance was published by the @entity77 - which include the @entity28 , the @entity29 , @entity78 @entity65 and @entity79 - after concerns of rising levels of obesity and heart disease			1
it will be used by @entity87 carrying out health mots , the five - yearly @entity85 checks offered to all patients aged 40 to 70			2
professor @entity90 , medical director of the @entity28 , said : ‘ if you take a woman , let ’s say in her early forties , with stonkingly high cholesterol , very high blood pressure and who smokes , her ten - year risk is still fairly low			1
but her lifetime risk is huge			0
‘ people need to start changing their lifestyles at a much earlier age			0
if you wait until your fifties and sixties , it ’s too late			0
’ professor sir @entity106 , of @entity107 , who has carried out extensive research on statins , said : ‘ the difference with these guidelines is they are saying that although risk is lower at younger ages , your potential benefit over the long term is greater			0
’ sir @entity106 recently said patients were unnecessarily dying from heart attacks because doctors were overly cautious about prescribing statins			0
side - effects include nausea , cataracts and , most seriously , myopathy , a condition leading to muscle pain and potential fatal liver failure			0
@entity129 , the @entity85 medicines regulator , is due to publish its own guidelines on statins this summer but they will take into account this new advice from heart experts .			2

middle - aged adults will receive drugs to prevent *problems* in decades ' time
at the moment only people with heart disease - or at high risk - take statins
