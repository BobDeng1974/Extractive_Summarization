he made his debut in the @entity2 and played under @entity3 , was kept out of the @entity5 side by @entity6 , got out of @entity7 before mortars started landing and now shares a dressing room with a @entity11 winner in @entity12 , where sacred cows are as big an obstacle as defenders			1
meet @entity17 lad @entity16 , the striker who was touted for a call - up to the @entity20 national team – his adopted country where he is a household name – but is now one of just three englishmen playing in the new @entity25 , which kicked off this week			1
indeed , the 28 - year - old starred as @entity27 – including former @entity29 defender @entity28 - opened with a 1 - 0 win over @entity31 , for whom both @entity32 and @entity16 's former @entity34 team - mate @entity33 play			1
@entity16 in action for @entity27 in the @entity37 @entity16 's @entity27 team beat the @entity39 in their opening match of the tournament the eight - team league – where famous cricketers and @entity45 actors are club owners - runs until december and marquee names such as @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 are expected to draw crowds totalling nearly three million over the course of the inaugural edition of the tournament			1
last season , @entity16 was the only @entity55 player representing a foreign club in the @entity57 or @entity58			1
in fact , he is @entity61 ’s top @entity60 scorer of all - time			1
but this in an altogether different challenge , on and off the pitch			2
forget traffic jams on the @entity69 or clearing snow from your driveway in 24 - hour darkness in @entity5 , the journey to training in the city of @entity67 is like the tale of @entity76 ’s @entity75 ‘ getting around the place is mad – we ’ve driven through floods , farmers walking their cows , goats , and sheep everywhere , 10 cars in two lanes , it ’s crazy , ’ says @entity16 , whose @entity20 wife @entity77 remains in @entity78 – just outside of @entity79 - finishing her interior - design studies			1
@entity16 ( centre ) in @entity58 action for @entity61 , where he spent six seasons , against @entity94 former @entity96 star @entity95 ( right ) featured in @entity98 's win against @entity99 in the opening game former @entity29 left back @entity28 unveils @entity27 's new strip ‘ but cows are holy and you get a £ 400 fine if you hit one ! i would never , ever drive here in my life and thankfully we have drivers			1
but they use their arms as indicators and never stop tooting the horn , it ’s 24/7 – they use the horn more than the brake			2
‘ then there will be a dad driving a moped with the mum on the back holding the two kids			2
every car is ruined because they just hit each other all the time			2
’ so how did @entity16 end up in a cattle jam in @entity12 ? a graduate of @entity34 ’s academy , he broke into the first team in 2005 before enjoying a goal - laden loan spell at @entity131 in @entity5 , managed by former @entity133 defender @entity132 , who once saved @entity16 by blasting the heaters in his car when the frostbitten rookie first arrived in the country			1
@entity16 at a @entity27 training session in @entity67 with security guards hitting a cow in @entity12 could land you with a fine of £ 400 as they are the country 's sacred animal @entity5 striker @entity6 champions @entity61 made a permanent offer and he spent six seasons there , becoming fluent in @entity20 , meeting his future wife and scoring enough goals to generate a clamour for nationalisation and a call - up			1
‘ @entity6 plays in my position though , and he ’s not bad , ’ he laughs when that subject is brought up			1
there was a loan period back at @entity34 last year and a spell at @entity161 ’s @entity160 before the offer of the @entity25			1
‘ i loved @entity7 , ’ he says			1
‘ it ’s so vibrant and young			2
i was a bit nervous but the war was very calm while i was there			2
‘ my friend at @entity170 , @entity171 , who played for @entity173 , he and his family had to be in a shelter for two weeks and it was chaos , he ’s never experienced anything like it			1
‘ but thankfully we left just before all of that kicked off			2
although when we first got to @entity12 it was n’t easy			2
‘ agents can make things sound very glamorous and we went to @entity184 - a small village at the top of a mountain where one of the owners is from - to do some promotion work			1
‘ you ’d be lucky if there were three bars , no internet and there was absolutely nothing to do			2
after three days @entity77 went home ! ’ now , however , @entity16 resides in a five - star luxury hotel			1
although he admits the contrast between wealth and poverty is stark			0
‘ we ’ve got a good training pitch and stadium			0
but that is the only good pitch in an area of five million people – the rest are terrible , ’ he says			0
‘ @entity209 football just is n’t there			0
cricket is fantastic – there are nets and pitches everywhere			0
‘ but this is the aim of the @entity25 – trying to get football out there to the kids			1
they are distributing hundreds of thousands of footballs			0
but i look out of my hotel window and see poverty			0
‘ kids playing bare footed on a hard , mud pitch			1
cows walk around on the street			0
the people do n’t have proper clothes , they ’re just wearing rags basically			0
it ’s quite a dirty country and there is rubbish everywhere			0
@entity16 on his way to training in @entity67 as he makes his way through floods ‘ they do n’t seem to care			1
when we finish training they just go and throw all of the water bottles in the river			0
‘ just past our swimming pool are tin shelters where people live			0
the extremes here are massive			0
you feel sorry for the kids , they ’re not even playing with a proper football			2
‘ but then they come to watch us train and they ’re so happy to be there – it warms your heart			0
’ what about the football ? @entity258 are currently second and have two home games before a trip to @entity261 ’s @entity99			0
‘ you have to split the team – six international players and five @entity12 players , ’ he explains			0
‘ the young @entity12 lads have a lot to learn			0
they only start playing when they ’ re 15 so they do n’t understand football like we do , like the concept of taking the ball to the corner if you ’re winning late on			1
‘ but they ’re improving , even in the five weeks i ’ve been here they ’ve got better			0
‘ our first game was incredible , 35,000 people were there and it was live on tv ( coverage can reach 650 million people )			0
there were fireworks , bands and all sorts going on			0
the younger lads were a bit nervous but once we settled we did well and it was brilliant to win			0
’ @entity16 's @entity20 wife @entity77 is still back home in @entity78 , just outside @entity79 @entity16 and his wife @entity77 in @entity5 , where the footballer hopes to settle one day @entity16 is not about to add @entity293 to his cv , but with @entity28 , striker @entity295 and former @entity297 defender @entity296 for comrades , he admits @entity299 is an option			1
‘ @entity28 is amazing , ’ he says			0
‘ there are so few footballers who have won a @entity11 – to be sitting in a dressing - room with him is incredible			2
‘ after the first game we sat and had a beer together			0
we were laughing about how much media we ’ve been doing to promote the league out here – he ’s spent more time on a plane than he has on the pitch			2
’ does he , though , ever regret not pursuing a career within these shores ? ‘ when i left @entity34 it was just to get some first - team football and try something different in a new country , it was exciting , ’ he reflects			1
‘ but then they had their financial troubles and all of the young players got a chance in the @entity2			1
@entity323 , @entity324 , the lads i played with , started to get an opportunity			2
@entity324 was at @entity34 at the same time as @entity16 and now plays for @entity327 ‘ i do think , “ what if ? ”			1
if i had stayed what could i have become ? i was doing well , i was one of their best young players			0
maybe if i ’d stayed six months more things could have been very , very different			0
‘ but i love @entity5 and the plan is to settle down there eventually and stay in the game in coaching			1
‘ my mum does n’t know what to say about it all – she thinks i ’m mad			0
but my dad thinks it ’s brilliant and he tries to watch as many games as possible			0
‘ so i ’ve no real regrets			0
i ’ve played at a good level , i ’ve seen the world and had so many experiences i would n’t have had if i ’d stayed in @entity55			2
’ the car horns apart , @entity16 is having a blast			1
