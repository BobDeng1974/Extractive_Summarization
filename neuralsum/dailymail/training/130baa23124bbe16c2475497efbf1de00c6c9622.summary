@entity0 has pledged to cover hundreds of miles this winter to gen up on the opposition as he strives to deliver @entity3 glory to @entity4			1
the @entity5 achieved a winning start in his new job when the @entity4 won 3 - 1 at @entity8 in front of the @entity11 cameras on monday night			1
and @entity0 , who says he is influenced by compatriots @entity13 and @entity14 , has pledged to make his team ‘ as exciting as possible			1
’ @entity0 emerges from the tunnel at @entity17 to begin his new career at @entity4 @entity19 gave @entity0 a great start to his tenure heading home from a corner against @entity8 @entity0 applauds his new players during his first game in @entity27 management @entity0 says he is influenced by compatriots @entity13 ( left ) and @entity14 @entity29 ’s appointment of the former @entity31 and @entity32 striker raised a few eyebrows , especially since @entity0 has only one season of managerial experience under his belt - at @entity37 in the @entity39 second division			1
but the 42 - year - old is more than happy to work his way up from the bottom tier of the @entity43			2
he said : ‘ for me , it ’s not about starting in @entity3 , @entity45 , the @entity46 or the @entity47			2
it ’s about the job , it ’s about the project and where the club wants to go			0
former @entity32 striker @entity0 holds a @entity29 scarf aloft during his unveiling as their new manager ‘ you look at the history , the people who run the club , the potential - those were the important bits , not that @entity29 are in @entity3			1
‘ this is a club going in the right direction and i want to be part of that			0
i feel we are a good fit			0
’ @entity0 added : ‘ i ’m not too proud to work at this level - it ’s still the same game			1
ok , it might be a bit different , but we are still here to win football matches and it ’s about passion			0
i love football because of the passion , whatever the level			0
’ there was plenty of excitement around the former @entity47 star trying his hand in the lower leagues the new @entity29 manager signs a shirt outside the ground for a fan with an old @entity32 jersey that passion will see @entity0 cover the length and breadth of the country over the coming weeks and months to ensure @entity29 can maintain and perhaps improve on their current fourth position in the table			1
‘ if we are not playing and future opponents have a game , i will drive hundreds of miles to go and watch them if necessary , ’ he said			2
‘ and i would do that if i was working in the championship , or at the majority of @entity47 clubs , as well			0
it ’s just part of the job			0
maybe the @entity47 is a bit different because every game is on tv			2
@entity0 celebrates scoring a goal for @entity32 against @entity111 back in april 2004 ‘ i have been at clubs with two analysts instead of the one we have at @entity29 ; and we have one scout for every three or four that other clubs might have			1
‘ it ’s the detail where things are just a little different , but that does n’t matter - it is what it is , and i ’m ready for it			0
’ we saw a first glimpse of the type of football @entity0 ’s @entity29 will be playing when they cruised to a 3 - 1 win over fellow promotion contenders @entity8 at @entity17 and it is clear a philosophy is taking shape			1
@entity0 ( left ) and assistant manager @entity133 are all smiles at their unveiling earlier this month @entity0 said : ‘ every manager you have played under or worked for , you learn from them all			1
there are always things you like and , sometimes , things you do n’t like , but you use them to your benefit			0
‘ i ’m very fond of @entity145 ( they worked together at @entity147 ) , i ’m fond of @entity13 , @entity14 , the list goes on			2
i ’m very fortunate , i ’ve worked with some top managers			2
‘ we ’re going to try to be as exciting as possible			0
i like my team to be positive , whatever that is , and there ’s still a lot of work to be done			0
but i do have a good group to work with here , and they are willing to learn			0
’ @entity0 only had the luxury of three training sessions to prepare his team for the trip to @entity8 and the fixture list does n’t get any easier			1
they welcome current league leaders @entity163 to the @entity164 on saturday and then travel to second - placed @entity165 next weekend .			1
