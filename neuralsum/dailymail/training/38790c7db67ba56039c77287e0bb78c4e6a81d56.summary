smoking chimneys and garish gasometers invade the skyline			2
the backdrop is poignant if not pretty , for here , amid the industrial heartland of the @entity6 , rumbles one of the talent factories responsible for powering @entity9 to @entity11 success			1
this is the academy of @entity13 , once home to @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 - more than £ 100million ’s worth of talent and a key part of the squad in @entity23			1
and here ’s the bad news , at least from an @entity27 perspective - there is more to come			1
captain @entity29 , record goalscorer @entity30 and defender per @entity32 may have retired since their crowning night in @entity34 , but on sunday evening in @entity36 a golden generation — this lot have the medals to support that moniker — begin their quest for continental dominance when their @entity43 qualifying campaign opens against @entity45			1
so what is their secret formula ? forget football for a moment ; it is the chemistry of character , maturity , education and trust which is key in @entity53			2
@entity69 , academy director , points first to his head and only later to his feet when asked what makes a world champion footballer , and he should know			1
‘ mentality is the first thing we look for , ’ he says , having already agreed that @entity9 ’s squad in @entity23 was psychologically superior to the rest			1
‘ any of our scouts know the information we want above all else			2
what is his mentality ? what is he doing when the team are losing ? how do his team - mates react to him ? ‘ the second step is what they can do with their feet			1
there have been players who would make our team better , for sure , but in the future they would have been a black sheep			1
this is especially important for @entity13 , it is more than technical skills			1
’ earlier in the day an under - 16 match is watched by upwards of 500 spectators , many enjoying a beer and a bockwurst - traditional @entity102 sausage - laid on by the club			1
@entity69 believes early exposure to crowds is one of the reasons why @entity9 ’s players invite the amplified pressure of a major tournament , whereas @entity27 ’s boys shy away on the international stage			1
‘ i visited @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 — all the facilities are so unbelievable and they are better than here			2
the pitches are like golf greens , ’ he says			0
‘ but maybe the difference is mentality and maturity			1
when i was there i thought to myself , “ where are the spectators ? ” some of the games i went to they were not allowed to watch			0
why the secret ? dream factory : park stadium , @entity13 's headquarters , training grounds and medical facilities honest surroundings : there 's nothing especially glamorous about @entity13 's headquarters ... but the complex and those behind the development of youth players have many reasons to be proud ‘ i think players need to feel pressure			1
in @entity27 , perhaps they do n’t			0
in @entity9 , we want to treat our players like men from a young age and encourage them to take responsibility			2
’ on the subject of @entity27 , @entity154 offers : ‘ i think the one thing which has to change is the number of foreign players in the @entity159			2
before @entity162 ( when @entity9 suffered an embarrassing exit at the group stage ) it was the same here , you could not find a @entity102 centre - forward in the @entity153			2
‘ but after 2000 we changed everything , from top to bottom			0
’ one innovation was education			0
within the grounds of the academy is the @entity171 , a partial boarding school which now boasts a quartet of @entity11 winners as alumni , as well as several of the current first team who came third in the @entity153 last season			1
but it is not just about academic grades			0
@entity13 are strict on their youngsters absorbing the history of the club			1
their nickname - @entity13 - means the @entity184 , the team having originally been made up of workers from the nearby coalmine			1
indeed , the tunnel at the 79,000 - capacity @entity189 has been transformed to resemble their forefathers ’ underground workplace			2
future stars : @entity13 midfielder @entity59 and @entity58 celebrate a @entity153 goal next wave : @entity59 ( left ) , 18 , and @entity58 , 19 , have already been capped with the national team ‘ everybody always asks me , “ why are you so successful ? ” ’ laughs @entity69 , a coach since his twenties			1
he is now 41 and one of @entity9 ’s most respected voices on youth football			0
‘ of course , you need excellent scouts and coaches and a little bit of luck			0
but i believe in making small differences			0
‘ one of them , for us , is that we believe it is very important to tell the players the history of @entity13 , to have this in the mind , to always have the spirit of @entity13 in the heart			1
that breeds loyalty and passion			0
@entity17 has been here since he was nine , @entity221 ( @entity16 ) also			1
they know the club and have desire for it			2
the reference to the miners reminds them of the hard work needed to succeed			0
’ there is also a more recent reminder of the club ’s proud history just beyond the academy , where a retro @entity235 floodlight towers above a crumbling stadium			1
that is the old @entity239 , a host venue at @entity241 and scene of @entity9 ’s 2 - 0 win over @entity244 , with @entity245 and @entity246 the scorers			2
connection to history : @entity13 redesigned their home tunnel to represent the club 's coal mining heritage club spirit : @entity17 has been part of the @entity13 system since he was nine years old @entity246 , until @entity256 , was perhaps the most famous graduate of @entity13 ’s youth system			1
as i chat with @entity69 , @entity246 , now 48 , is himself just a few hundred yards away at an open day for supporters where more than 100,000 have gathered to meet stars past and present			1
everywhere there is evidence of togetherness , community and spirit , a club safeguarding its future			2
to that end , finding talent is the continual challenge facing @entity69 and his team of scouts			1
so where do they unearth their gems ? a lot closer than you would perhaps think			0
@entity15 and @entity18 were born in @entity53 , @entity17 in the bordering city of @entity281 and @entity16 just 20 miles away in @entity282			1
there is no need for @entity286 superscouts , as @entity69 explains : ‘ up to 13 [ years old ] we only go 20 kilometres around			1
up to 15 we extend to our region , which includes 16 million people			0
it must be possible to find good players in that area , and that is our philosophy here			1
i say to my scouts , “ please look here first ”			0
‘ after 15 we might start looking abroad			0
but look at the players we are successful with , most are from @entity9 and from very close to @entity53			2
‘ one of our scouts is 62 and he only looks out for players between nine and 12 – but he has an unbelievable eye , the best			2
if he comes to me and says he likes a player , he is never wrong			0
‘ and we have more coming through now : @entity59 , @entity58 and @entity304 — watch out for them , they are waiting to be the next stars , for @entity13 and the national side			1
’ for while the furnaces of the @entity6 continue to blaze , a diamond is always being mined nearby			0
@entity15 ( 28 years old , 203 apps for @entity13 before £ 18m move to @entity312 in 2011 ) ‘ @entity115 is great , i like him so much			1
at 16 the coaches said he was too small , but he grew 20cm and is now the best goalkeeper in the world			0
he is someone who always had the mentality to make it to the very top			2
’ @entity16 ( 26 years old , 236 apps / 18 goals , still at the club ) ‘ @entity221 played on the left side in the @entity11			1
he had never done that before , that is unbelievable			0
he is not so fast or good with the ball but he is so intelligent			0
so you can see , there are different ways to become a professional			0
’ @entity17 ( 20 years old , 150 apps / 27 goals , still at club ) ‘ there is always speculation about @entity17 ’s future but it is better for him to stay here			1
he made his debut at 16 and there was a lot of hype			0
but he had a dip also when he was younger			0
we keep faith with our players though and now he has the chance to be a fantastic player			2
’ @entity18 ( 25 years old , 39 apps / 1 goal for @entity13 before £ 4m move to @entity348 in 2008 ) ‘ @entity18 was unbelievable at a young age , a real no 10			1
but now i do n’t think he is the right player for the @entity159 ( with @entity350 )			0
he is not a fighter			0
if you need to fight in a match then that ’s not him			0
i think it would be good for him to make a new start , but he is too expensive for us now ! ’ and one for the future … @entity59 ( 18 years old , 50 apps / 7 goals , still at club ) ‘ he has already been capped by @entity9			1
i have never seen anyone like him			0
you can wake him up at four o’clock in the morning and he ’ll go out and play			0
he could be one of the best players in the world in the future			2
but when he was 14 he was so small , everyone said “ what do you want with this player ? ”			0
we realised the potential he had			0
he had skills you can not learn			0
’ it 's not too late to play @entity373 … there 's £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest scoring manager			0
