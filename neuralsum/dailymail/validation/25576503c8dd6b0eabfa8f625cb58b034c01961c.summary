betrayed : controversial critic @entity0 revealed once - trusted friends have stolen his paintings he has built an impressive art collection over a decades - long career as @entity6 ’s most - feared critic			1
but now @entity0 has revealed that some of the works he has accumulated have gone missing – stolen by once - trusted friends			1
‘ it is surprising how unpleasant people can be , ’ he tells @entity9 today			0
‘ how untrustworthy friends can become			1
‘ how somebody you think you can absolutely depend on will do something so mean that it astonishes you			0
’ none of mr @entity0 ’s light - fingered visitors are likely to face justice since he has decided to not report the matter to police			1
the critic , who is suffering from cancer , refuses to identify those he holds responsible for betraying him but makes it abundantly clear that he knows who they are			1
the thefts have occurred over the past ten years and came to light recently when he started sorting through his belongings , bagging up old clothes for charity and consigning other unwanted items to the bonfire			1
friends and acquaintances visiting his home in @entity39 , @entity40 , have made off with paintings and drawings , he says , and , when challenged , have denied all knowledge			1
however , @entity0 has confessed that he occasionally indulged in similar behaviour himself when visiting friends ’ homes – though on a much smaller scale			1
he said : ‘ i have stolen the odd book myself			0
i have a theory that only men steal books , although when i proposed that to a woman a month or two ago she was absolutely outraged			1
‘ it ’s not really books i ’m worrying about – it ’s small paintings and drawings which quietly disappear			2
you do n’t know when they disappear but , when you think about it , it ’s only ... when people have been to the house			0
it makes me so angry and helpless because you ca n’t do anything about it			0
’ @entity0 , whose trenchant views once led to leading figures in the art world demanding his dismissal as the @entity75 ’s art critic , also speaks – with some reluctance – about his illness			2
' i have stolen the odd book myself , ' the critic said			2
' it ’s not really books i ’m worrying about – it ’s small paintings and drawings which quietly disappear			2
it ’s only ... when people have been to the house ' ‘ i think a serene death with my dogs on the bed would be wonderful , ’ he said			0
‘ it may still happen			0
i really do n’t know			0
’ the 84 - year - old has admitted to disliking children but loving animals – ironically as his latest book is aimed at youngsters			1
the @entity98 , which has just been published , is about a wounded donkey found by a tv crew visiting @entity101 – and he says he wrote it as a ‘ distraction ’ from his radiotherapy			0
last night he said he had confronted the ‘ friends ’ he suspected of robbing him but had failed to get any of the missing artworks back			2
‘ i have always done it face - to - face and i now know it is n’t worth doing because it simply gets worse – the lies do n’t help			0
