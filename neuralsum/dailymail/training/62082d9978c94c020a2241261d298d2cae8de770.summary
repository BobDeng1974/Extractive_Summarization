by @entity0 published : 18:37 est , 12 march 2014 updated : 01:06 est , 13 march 2014 a 20 - year - old hairdresser from a @entity4 suburb has two good samaritans to thank for pulling her to safety from the burning wreckage of her car following a horrific crash over the weekend			1
@entity12 was driving home to @entity14 at around 2am saturday when she veered off @entity15 in @entity16 and slammed into a tree			1
her car immediately burst into flames			2
as her parents later described in a touching letter addressed to her rescuers , their daughter was lying badly injured and disoriented inside a burning car flipped on its side when she heard a voice from the outside and saw a shadow			1
@entity46 , a @entity47 engineer and former firefighter and paramedic , was also driving in the area after finishing his shift and pulled over			1
working together , the two complete strangers armed with a single fire extinguisher were able to tame the flames just long enough for @entity31 to pull the severely injured @entity55 out of the managed vehicle			1
just 30 seconds later , the 2006 @entity57 turned into a fireball			0
the young hair stylist from @entity14 suffered a broken spine , fractured several ribs , her clavicle , a leg and one of her wrists			1
@entity66 crash : miss @entity12 was driving home saturday on @entity15 in @entity16 when she became distracted by her gps and slammed into a tree , sparking a fire kindness of strangers : while @entity12 lay with a broken spine in the overturned burning car , she heard the voices of two motorists who pulled over and rushed to her aid life savers : @entity31 , a nursing assistant and firefighter ( left ) pulled @entity55 to safety with the help of @entity47 engineer @entity46 , who bought him about 30 seconds by spraying the flames with his fire extinguisher on tuesday , miss @entity12 , who has been undergoing treatment at @entity36 since saturday , had a tearful reunion with the two men whom she now calls her ' guardian angels			1
' ' i just remember sitting in the car and screaming for my life , like , “ you need to get me out of here ! ” ' @entity55 recalled to @entity94 from her hospital bed			2
‘ he [ @entity31 ] got there five seconds later			2
literally , someone was watching over me			0
’ the bedridden young victim with a brace on her neck explained that on the night of the accident , she briefly glanced at her gps , and a moment later her car struck a tree near @entity105 and caught fire			1
@entity31 , whose father is a 40 - year veteran of the @entity108 , reached the burning wreckage first and tried to break the windshield with his boots , but to no avail			2
he was soon joined by @entity46 , whose dashboard camera recorded the pair 's heroic efforts			2
at first , the @entity47 worker tried to use his fire extinguisher as a battering ram to crack the windshield			1
when that did not work , @entity46 sprayed the intensifying flames , which by then had spread to the interior of the car , with foam from his handheld extinguisher			1
his split - second decision bought @entity31 enough time to grab @entity55 and extract her from the vehicle , which was consumed by the raging inferno just seconds later			1
laundry list of injuries : the blonde , 20 - year - old hair stylist from @entity14 suffered a broken spine , fractured ribs , clavicle , a leg and one of her wrists true gratitude : @entity12 and her family said they were eternally grateful to the woman 's rescuers for putting their lives at risk in order to save her from certain death ‘ there was a moment when i said to him i ’m going to die tonight , ’ @entity12 told @entity150			1
‘ i ’m not going to make it out			0
i ’m going to die in here			0
he said , “ i ’m not leaving you behind			0
i ’m getting you out of here			0
” ’ later , the young woman , who is now on a long road to recovery , called her rescue a ‘ miracle ’ and said that she would not be alive today without @entity46 and @entity31			2
@entity12 ’s father , @entity164 , celebrated his 50th birthday tuesday , calling his daughter ’s rescue the best present a parent could get			0
‘ these guys are heroes , they are part of my family without a doubt , ’ he told the @entity169			0
‘ i do n’t know how i could ever repay these guys			0
without them , it ’d be a totally different story			0
’ on his part , @entity31 has dismissed the notion that he was a hero , insisting that he was just doing his job			0
‘ people talk about rewards and things like that , ’ the humble firefighter told the station @entity150			0
‘ my reward is to look her in her face and see her smile at the end of the day , that 's my reward			0
