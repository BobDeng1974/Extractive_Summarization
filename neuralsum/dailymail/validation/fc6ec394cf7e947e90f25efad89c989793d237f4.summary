when @entity0 started the year with a @entity2 award nobody thought 2015 could ever turn into his annus horribilis			0
but since his ' @entity5 ! ' war cry in @entity6 when he collected the trophy and sent an ' i 'm coming for you ' message to @entity11 , the @entity14 forward 's fortunes have been in free - fall to the extent that the exit door that leads back to @entity18 has been opened once again			1
@entity0 's agent @entity19 told @entity21 radio his player would go on scoring goals for @entity14 until he is 40 as the club and the player 's entourage celebrated his well - deserved gong in january			1
@entity14 forward @entity0 sits on the @entity28 pitch during his side 's 2 - 0 win against @entity31 the former @entity18 man endured a frustrating evening despite his side 's @entity34 victory @entity0 has a shot at goal on sunday night but he was unable to find the back of the net but since then he has been sent off and banned for two games ; chastised by supporters for holding a birthday party through the early hours after a humiliating derby day defeat by @entity44 and pledged a vow of silence after the team 's defeat in the @entity49 to @entity50			1
@entity18 have been linked with both a bold move for @entity52 or a romantic return for @entity0			1
sources in @entity14 now say of the two moves , it would be a bid for @entity0 that would meet with less resistance			0
for all the boos and whistles for @entity52 from sections of the @entity65 crowd the club president @entity59 is firmly behind his £ 86million signing and sees him as @entity0 's heir apparent			1
@entity0 is even understood to have done more to help the former @entity68 forward as he tries to push his profile and get himself on next year 's @entity2 podium			2
the request was not received with open arms			0
much like @entity52 when he scored twice on sunday against @entity31			0
@entity52 celebrates after opening the scoring but @entity0 appeared frustrated that he had n't found the net @entity0 celebrates winning the @entity76 title with @entity18 shortly before leaving in 2009 a return to @entity78 is not out of the question for the @entity81 superstar after a miserable start to 2015 @entity14 trio @entity0 , @entity52 and @entity83 share an embrace after the @entity86 's second goal @entity52 , pictured with his partner @entity87 , is seen as the heir to @entity0 by @entity59 @entity0 failed to celebrate his team - mate 's opening goal because he was too busy lamenting his own misfortune at not scoring after failing to connect properly with a scissor kick from the edge of the six - yard area			1
like the incredible sulk of old , @entity0 could be seen throwing his arms up in the air both before and after @entity52 converted the rebound			0
@entity99 tweeted : ' @entity0 's extraordinarily stroppy reaction to @entity52 scoring from a rebound from his effort was bizarre and unhealthy			1
' he was also frustrated when @entity52 scored his second goal getting the slightest of touches on a @entity0 shot but enough to divert it past the @entity31 goalkeeper to wrap up the three points			2
and with those two goals for @entity52 and a string of misses from himself in what remained of the game , including one sitter in injury - time and a weak shot from a perfect @entity52 cross in the first half , @entity0 went straight down the tunnel at full - time , not to the centre circle to applaud supporters			2
@entity0 split up with his long - term girlfriend , @entity125 model and actress @entity126 , in january @entity0 's form has dipped since his split and @entity11 now has more goals than him this season @entity126 accompanied @entity0 to the @entity131 awards in january 2014 but she was absent this year off the pitch things have gone no better for him with a split from @entity125 girlfriend @entity126 ensuring he has filled the pages of many of @entity21 's gossip magazines amid speculation about why the couple broke up and who his next partner will be			1
all this with the @entity142 on the horizon – a match he would never have dreamed he would go in to on fewer goals than @entity11 who now has two more than his rival			0
last year @entity0 raced to a 12 - goal lead over @entity11 who was struggling for form and fell out spectacularly with his manager @entity150			2
@entity11 's relationship with his coach is now on the mend and he has scored 20 goals since the start of the year			0
things change so quickly in @entity21 football and @entity0 's last three months are evidence of that			2
what also may have changed is the possibility that after six extraordinary seasons at the @entity163 could yet find time in his record - breaking career to go back to @entity78 for a glorious swansong			0
@entity167 was more motivated - @entity168			0

@entity0 was left frustrated in @entity14 's win against @entity31
the @entity81 forward has been sent off and chastised by fans this year
@entity0 also broke up with his long - term girlfriend @entity126 in january
a return to his former club @entity18 is not out of the question
@entity14 president @entity59 sees @entity52 as @entity0 's heir
