budget prices : @entity1 is introducing @entity3 burgers at £ 2.99 each in a bid to chase from @entity5 as it steps up its chase for middle and high income shoppers an a list celebrity might spend £ 29 on a @entity3 burger at @entity11 ’s @entity10 – after all it is renowned around the world as a byword for luxury given its flavour and succulence			1
alternatively , you could try the local @entity1 , where the budget chain is introducing @entity3 burgers at £ 2.99 each			1
the budget chain is to offer a limited stock of @entity3 burgers made with beef imported from @entity5 as it steps up its chase for middle and high income shoppers			1
normally , luxury restaurants , stores and gourmet butchers sell the beef for the equivalent of an eye - watering £ 100 per kilo – so putting it out of reach for most families			1
however , @entity1 is bringing the beef , which originated with pampered cattle in @entity34 , to the masses			0
last year the company sold @entity3 sirloin and rib - eye steaks at £ 6.99 each , which resulted in something of a stampede among the @entity42 - driving classes			1
it believes the burgers will be similarly successful			0
wagyu beef stands out from other meat because of its distinctive marbling with fat , which melts into the meat during cooking to produce a fabulous taste and moist texture			2
the cattle were initially introduced to @entity34 as a beast of burden to help cultivate rice during the 2nd century			0
beer was fed to the animals during the hot summers to stimulate appetite , while massaging was used to prevent muscles cramping on small farms in @entity34 where the animals did not have sufficient room to move around			0
kobe beef is the purest , highest quality of the meat , which is produced from the black @entity68 - ushi breed of @entity3 cattle and raised according to strict tradition			1
however , the demand and appetite for the beef is now so great that herds are now being reared across the globe , including the @entity76 and @entity5			2
beef from @entity3 cows is sold for as much as £ 100 per kilo in luxury restaurants and gourmet butchers @entity1 said the decision to stock the burgers was inspired by the menu at the @entity85 ball			1
stars such as @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 were amongst the 1,500 members of @entity92 royalty to dine at infamous @entity93 , where @entity94 served with @entity95 were on the menu			0
the chain ’s managing director of corporate buying , @entity97 , said : ‘ at @entity1 our shoppers love to try out lots of specialist products , and @entity3 is no exception			2
following the frenzy around the @entity3 steaks @entity1 sold last summer , we wanted to offer something new that would excite our customers			0
following his @entity85 success , @entity88 dined at the @entity93 where @entity94 served with @entity95 were on the menu ‘ @entity1 ’s @entity111 are made from premium quality @entity3 beef , and are available at an everyday low price , which our customers have come to know and love			1
’ at the @entity117 , the £ 29 @entity3 burger is served with tomato relish and truffle mayonnaise			2
@entity1 suggests teaming its version with its @entity121 , which are 99p for four , and a pack of @entity124 cheese , which is £ 2.29			0
that would give a price for the @entity1 version of less than £ 4 – assuming you only need a few slices of the cheese .			0
