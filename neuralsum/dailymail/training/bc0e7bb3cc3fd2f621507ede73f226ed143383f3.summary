by @entity0 it is certainly a unique sight , and one that could , it is claimed , save thousands of lives			0
a bicycle with a giant set of light up cat 's whiskers if the latest gadget aiming to make cyclist 's lives safer			1
they can be used to warn other road users a cyclist is approaching , let drivers know exactly how much space is needed , and even twitch to indicate a turn			0
controlled by a button on the handlebars , the four long whiskers on the @entity32 can flick fully outward , discouraging a car from squeezing by			1
reflective stripes make each whisker stand out even more			0
when a cyclist wants to turn , they can flick the whiskers on one side in the right direction and flash lights inside as a signal			1
called @entity46 , the whiskers were invented by students at @entity48			1
' when you ’re in the middle of the street with cars , what tends to happen is drivers see the space around you and they ’ll attempt to pass , ' @entity49 , who worked on the design for the @entity32 with five fellow students , told @entity59			1
' it ’s dangerous for the cyclist , and dangerous for the car if there ’s oncoming traffic			1
but what if we could expand the bike to look bigger , so cars do n't try to go around ? ' the four whiskers can change their configuration , allowing the cyclists to signal their intentions			1

when a cyclist wants to turn , they can flick the whiskers on one side in the right direction and flash lights inside as a signal			1
the whiskers can glow at night , and when they are needed to act as turn indicators ' cycling as a form of transportation is a growing alternative to fossil - fuel powered vehicles , but as cycling grows more popular each year , cities like @entity94 are implementing initiatives to develop their infrastructure in order to accommodate this exploding demographic , ' the students wrote			2
' by interviewing various members of the @entity94 bicycle community , we were able to determine three main concerns : communication of a bicyclist ’s intentions , increased visibility both day & night , and proper allocation of space when sharing the road			0
' the team then spent time at zoos and animal parks to look at how nature approached the problem			0
' by visiting various biomes within our city and with the help of university biologists , we identified several animals that have evolved attributes with the potential to solve these concerns - namely peacocks , ctenophores , and rodents			0
' using their unique traits , we designed @entity46 , a mountable bicycle accessory that sports flexible , illuminated whiskers			2
' these luminescent tendrils provide the user with several opportunities , ' the researchers say			0
' first , they exponentially increase visibility of the cyclists both day and night through a combination of both fluorescent bands and stripes of emitted light			0
' second , these four whiskers can change their configuration , allowing the cyclists to signal their intentions			2
' finally , @entity144 empowers the cyclist with the ability to indicate their spatial zone by flaring their whiskers and flashing warning colors			2
' the project was part of the @entity153 , which asked design students to take inspiration from local ecology to tackle a transportation issue .			0
