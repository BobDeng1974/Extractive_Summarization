@entity1 legends joined forces to hit back at a cheeky stunt by @entity5 supporters – kicking off @entity6 week with an old - fashioned war of words			1
a group of @entity5 fans took out an advert in a @entity13 sunday newspaper paper branding @entity1 a ‘ new club which came into being in 2012 ’ , declaring that this weekend ’s @entity16 semi-final will be the first meeting between the clubs – and hitting out at the ‘ continuation fiction ’ surrounding the @entity21 side			1
a number of the former @entity1 greats at @entity21 for yesterday ’s @entity24 took exception to this interpretation of history , @entity29 great @entity28 saying : ‘ they are fans and i think only one per cent of people think that way			1
i think most people think differently - and they will be looking forward to this game			1
@entity28 ( right ) rejects the notion that @entity1 are ' a new club ' that will play @entity5 for the first time ‘ of course , people in @entity39 think of @entity1 as the same club			1
they just think it is sad when they hear of it going into the @entity43			1
it is sad what happened because we have a lot of @entity29 history in the club and they hope it is back soon			1
‘ i have always known that there is a giant out there in @entity1 that is waiting to burst out			1
there will be good times again , for sure			2
’ former manager @entity56 went further , insisting : ‘ for me @entity5 are missing @entity1			1
you see empty spaces at @entity60			2
back in the day when @entity61 was there and they had a superb team , we did too			2
stadiums were full every week			2
‘ so @entity5 are missing @entity1			1
a lot of people will probably be trolling me for that but i think a lot of people will agree			2
’ @entity1 manager @entity56 believes @entity5 are missing the rivalry with @entity1 ex-midfielder @entity71 said of the advert : ‘ listen , that ’s just provoking things			1
if that ’s what they get their kicks from on the day , maybe it will take away from their performance ! ‘ seriously , good luck to them , they can conduct themselves like that if they want			2
‘ @entity1 , over the years , have tried to conduct themselves in the right manner , with a bit of dignity			1
‘ so it ’s not important what they do			2
what is important is how we conduct ourselves			2
’ and former defender @entity97 said : ‘ i have seen the same in @entity39 at @entity99 , the team i joined as a young lad			2
‘ when i came in , it was @entity99 , it was @entity99 when i played there and the name went back to @entity99			0
the shirt changed a little bit as well , but , overall , it is the same club			1
it is the same stadium , it is the same history			0
‘ you can never erase that			0
of course , i feel the same way about @entity1			1
it is a nice try , but no chance			0
it is in the heart of the people and that wo n’t change			0
@entity120 ( left ) of @entity1 in action against @entity5 's @entity122 ( right ) ‘ i think it is a bit of sarcasm			1
it is funny from their side			0
’ over 41,000 turned out for yesterday ’s benefit match for a visibly ailing @entity129 , @entity56 saying : ‘ it was great walking out and seeing another powerful moment involving @entity1 fans			1
‘ the noise they could make inside this stadium when it ’s full			0
it ’s so difficult to get it through your head rangers are n’t doing well when you see that support			0
‘ it ’s a brilliant tribute to @entity24 , these guys turning out like this a- nd i ’ve got to compliment the players turning out for helping a friend who ’s having a bad time			0
‘ he was emotional in the dressing room			0
he was trying to get things across to you and he was frustrated by that			0
‘ but the boys are very supporting of him and we just want to make everything as comfortable as possible for him			0
raising the funds from this game hopefully that can help him			0
’ @entity129 ( centre ) is carried by @entity161 ( left ) and @entity162 ( right ) after the tribute match @entity129 ( centre ) lifts the @entity165 trophy as a player for the club in 2005 an emotional @entity129 was carried around the stadium at the end of a tribute match at @entity21 @entity161 added : ‘ @entity24 was so full of spirit and a great fighter as a player and it is very sad when you see him			1
he is getting worse and worse , but the turnout was incredible and it was great to be back at the club			1
’ and @entity97 said : ‘ i last saw @entity24 about a year ago before @entity178 and he could move and speak much better than now			0
i was really shocked when i saw him because his hands were cramped , he was struggling with his balance and i can hardly understand him any more			0
‘ he is going backwards , but what the supporters did for him was unbelievable			0
they came here to support him and enjoy the old glories			0
they want to get that back , but that is a different story			0
