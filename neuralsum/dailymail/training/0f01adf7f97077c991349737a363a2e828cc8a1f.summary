scientists have grown ' fully - functioning ' human gut tissue inside a mouse - a breakthrough that could one day help many thousands suffering with intestinal disorders			1
by transplanting cells from a human into a mouse , paediatric surgeons successfully grew small intestine tissue that worked just like the ' real ' thing			1
doctors hope their findings will eventually help treat a range of digestive conditions as well as boost survival rates in sufferers of diseases such as short bowel syndrome ( @entity20 ) - a condition that kills nearly a third of young patients within five years			0
paediatrics have created tissue - engineered small intestine ( @entity26 ) tissue ( part of the small intestine 's duodenum ( pictured ) that replicates key aspects of a functioning human intestine			1
during tests the tissue proved it could break down sugars into glucose and release gastrointestinal hormones the research was led by dr @entity40 from the @entity41 ( @entity41 )			1
@entity41 had previously shown that tissue - engineered small intestine tissue could be ‘ grown ’ by implanting human donor tissue into mice			1
however , in initial studies - published in 2011 in the biomedical journal @entity47 , @entity48 - the intestine created had a limited range of functions			2
as part of the new study , the researchers created @entity26 that replicates key aspects of a functioning human intestine			1
in particular , the @entity26 developed contains the mucosal lining - or barrier - seen in fully - grown intestines			1
the small intestine is a tubular structure that carries food from the stomach up to the colon and its main function is to help with digestion			2
the small intestine increases 20 times in length as a person ages , from around 78 inches ( 200cm ) in a newborn baby , to almost six metres ( 20 feet ) long			0
it is typically three times the height of the child or adult and is the part of the intestines where 90 per cent of digestion and food absorption takes place			0
the remaining 10 per cent occurs in the stomach and large intestine			0
as food travels through the small intestine , it absorbs nutrients and minerals			0
chemical digestion uses enzymes to break down food into a form that can then be absorbed into tissues of the body			0
once at the colon , the large intestine carries it to the rectum			0
the main function of this organ is to aid in digestion			0
and , during tests the @entity26 proved it could break down sugars into glucose and release gastrointestinal hormones			1
mice were chosen for the study because mouse @entity26 is ‘ highly similar ’ to the @entity26 derived from human cells			2
for example , both contain important building blocks such as the stem and progenitor cells that continue to regenerate the intestine as a living tissue replacement			0
the researchers took cells from human intestine tissue and soaked them in a digestive enzyme solution			1
this solution was fitted onto a so - called polymer scaffold - a structure used to help the cells and tissue develop - which was then implanted into a mouse			2
four weeks later , the @entity26 was harvested and tested			0
scientists discovered it was able to break down sugars into glucose , and found the cells within the engineered tissue developed in close proximity to other specialised cells			1
these specialised cells are said to be necessary in healthy human intestine to create a fully functioning organ			2
‘ we have shown that we can grow tissue - engineered small intestine that is more complex than other stem cell or progenitor cell models that are currently used to study intestinal regeneration and disease , and proven it to be fully functional as it develops from human cells , ’ said dr @entity40			1
‘ demonstrating the functional capacity of this tissue - engineered intestine is a necessary milestone on our path toward one day helping patients with intestinal failure			1
’ @entity150 ( stock image ) were chosen for the study because mouse @entity26 is ‘ highly similar ’ to @entity26 from human cells			2
the researchers took cells from human intestines and soaked them in a digestive enzyme solution , which was then implanted into a mouse			1
four weeks later , the @entity26 was harvested and succesfully tested the research was published in the @entity161 : @entity162 , and brings surgeons a step closer to helping human patients using this regenerative medicine technique			2
in particular , it could be used to treat short bowel syndrome - a major cause of intestinal failure , particularly in premature babies and newborns with congenital intestinal problems			0
@entity26 may also , one day , replace intestinal transplantation and could solve the problem of donor shortages			0
without enough intestinal length , babies are dependent on intravenous feeding , which can cause liver damage			0
intestinal failure occurs in more than 24 out of 100,000 live births , with nearly a third of patients dying within five years .			0

scientists have previously grown small intestine donor tissue in a mouse
the *resulting* cells was *dubbed* tissue - engineered small intestine ( @entity26 )
however , only basic functions and components were created
new study has taken this a step further to create a fully - functional @entity26
it involved using cells from the human intestine soaked in a digestive enzyme solution that was implanted into a mouse
four weeks later , the @entity26 was able to break down sugars into glucose
it was also able to release gastrointestinal hormones and other functions seen in a fully - grown small intestine
