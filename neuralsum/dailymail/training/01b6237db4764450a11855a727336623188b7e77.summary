it barely measures half an inch long - but this tiny insect is capable of kicking up a stink			2
the halyomorpha halys is headed for our shores , experts say , and if you are there when it arrives you will certainly know about it			0
known as the marmorated stink bug , it is named after the putrid stench it releases from its glands as a defence mechanism			1
it has already created plague proportions in the @entity19 , has been spotted in @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 and biologists say it will ‘ inevitably ’ invade @entity25			1
two bugs have already been intercepted on imported timber on @entity25 ’s shores , and it is only a matter of time before more come into the country			1
the bugs , native to @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 , were accidentally introduced to the @entity19 in the mid- 1990s			1
they have since spread to 40 states and in 2010 ruined over £ 23 million worth of @entity19 apple crops alone			1
the distinctive brown adult bug is shaped like a shield and resembles several species common in @entity25			1
but the stench of rotten garbage it produices is unique			2
once mated , females lay up to 30 light green eggs on the underside of leaves that can hatch in three days			0
@entity63 @entity62 , of @entity65 ’s @entity64 , said : ‘ i think the brown marmorated stink bug will establish a population here			1
it is only a matter of time			0
‘ it will make its presence felt fairly quickly because it comes into people ’s homes in the autumn and winter			0
‘ ancestrally , it used to hibernate in abandoned caves and houses are the next best thing			0
‘ they are a nuisance and people wo n’t like brown stink bugs in their homes			2
in hotels in southern @entity19 states you have signs warning about stink bugs in rooms because that is the way it is			1
‘ it is very hard to get rid of them because they lay eggs and even if you get the exterminators in to vacuum them up , they come back the following year			0
the government ’s @entity99 ( @entity99 ) is warning people to check imported plants and containers for any sign of the pest			2
@entity99 ’s senior entomologist @entity106 said that the bug could well become a public nuisance in the @entity25			1
in the @entity19 , the brown marmorated stink bug has been detected in 41 states as well as two @entity112 provinces , posing severe agricultural problems in six states and nuisance problems in fifteen others mr @entity106 told @entity118 magazine : ‘ we have had a second interception on imported timber , so the bug has been found twice in the @entity25			1
‘ we have done a risk assessment			0
there is evidence the bug would be able to establish in the south of @entity128			2
‘ in @entity130 , it reaches plague proportions and there are records of hundreds or even a thousand in people ’s houses			0
‘ i do n’t expect plague proportions here but they make an evil , repellent odour to ward off predators , so a large number of bugs coming into your house is a rather compelling public nuisance			2
’ the bug usually produces up to five generations per year in warmer climates but only one or two in cooler climates			0
mr @entity106 said : ‘ later generations cause the most economic damage			0
the @entity25 climate means the bug would n’t have a significant economic impact on agriculture or horticulture like in @entity130			1
’ dr @entity160 , technical manager of pest management firm @entity161 , said : ‘ the bug is going to get here at some point soon			0
‘ it is already in @entity21 and @entity166 and they could hop into crates of goods or timber or plants being transported			1
and since it hibernates in buildings over the winter , once it is here there is a good chance that it will be a problematic pest			0
‘ these are bigger than ladybirds and when you try and disturb them or hoover them they produce a really foul smell			0
‘ researchers are trying to identify the chemical the stink bugs release to attract others , so that they can then be lured into pheromone traps			2
