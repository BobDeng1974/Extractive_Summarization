he is one fifth of the biggest boyband on the planet , created by the @entity3 in 2010			0
but today , as @entity5 is signed off the @entity7 tour due to ' stress ' , many are beginning to question whether fame is beginning to take its toll on the singer			1
indeed , there are some critics who suggest the 22 - year - old - who arrived at @entity14 early today - may be looking to make an exit from the group for good			2
in them , the singer is seen holding hands with a pretty blonde girl named @entity39 , despite the fact that he is engaged to @entity41 singer @entity26			1
clearly distressed by the release of the images , @entity5 tweeted : ' i 'm 22 years old ... i love a girl named @entity26			1
and there 's a lot of jealous f * * ks in this world i 'm sorry for what it looks like x ' @entity39 's friends have since come forward to defend her , and have said that there was nothing behind the intimate shots			2
a spokesman for the band revealed @entity5 's decision to take some time out saying : ' @entity5 has signed off with stress and is flying back to the @entity62 to recuperate			1
' the band wish him well and will continue with their performances in @entity65 and @entity66			0
' this photograph of @entity5 caused outrage as he is currently engaged to @entity41 singer @entity26 in this , it appears @entity5 is holding hands with @entity39			1
her friends have denied any wrong doing it has since been reported that the singer is struggling with having his personal life so publicly scrutinised			2
but even from the early stages of his career , @entity5 , who is known as the shyest member of the group , struggled with his fame - in particular , after he and his fellow bandmates @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 were catapulted onto a worldwide platform			1
and as early as 2012 , it appears that the cracks were beginning to show			0
in august of that year , @entity5 caused concerns among the ' directioners ' when he briefly quit @entity92			1
at the time he wrote : ' the reason i do n't tweet as much as i use to , is because i 'm sick of all the useless opinions and hate that i get daily goodbye twitter : ) ' however , he was back on the social media site 48 hours later saying : ' sorry , i was getting some abuse on twitter but i dont want to let my fans down			2
so i am back ! ! : ) x '			0
@entity5 and @entity26 , pictured here at @entity101 have been dating since 2011 , however , he has been accused of cheating on the @entity41 singer on more than one occasion it was around this time that @entity5 had been accused of cheating on @entity26 for the first time			1
he was filmed through the keyhole of a hotel room looking like he was trying to take a girl back to where he was staying			0
@entity5 and @entity26 's relationship had been rocked , and the singer 's personal affairs were been bought into the limelight , but it was only set to get worse			1
in february 2013 , @entity5 was accused of cheating on his fiance with an exotic dancer , @entity116 @entity115			1
in pictures - which were featured in @entity120 newspaper - the scruffy - haired singer was seen lying on a bed sleeping after allegedly having sex with the 23 - year - old			1
according to @entity115 , the pair met whilst out clubbing in @entity125 before the @entity7 star took her back to his Â£ 2.2million north @entity125 home			1
@entity115 said of the tryst : ' he 's an absolute s * * t. how dare he - not only to me but to @entity26 ? ' she added : ' i definitely do n't think it 's the first time he 's done this			1
i feel sorry for @entity26 - she does n't know this is going on			1
it 's wrong and it has to stop			2
' @entity5 is on fifth of one direction with bandmates l - r @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity83 and @entity86 @entity5 has been dating @entity26 since 2011 with the pair becoming engaged in august 2013			1
the @entity41 singer is yet to comment on the recent stories but was spotted last night leaving the house she shares with @entity5 , her engagement ring still on her finger			1
in november 2014 , he again caused concern for his well - being when he failed to make a trip to @entity150 with his group			0
and as rumours of drug use flew around the internet , @entity150 today show host @entity152 asked the rest of his bandmates : ' there have been rumours of substance abuse , what 's going on ? ' @entity5 told @entity120 that he had been hurt by the accusations saying : ' i 'm really angry and upset by what was said			1
i was really ill at the weekend , that 's why i could n't fly to @entity150			2
' and @entity5 has previously hinted that he would have never pursued a career in music it were it not for his bandmates			1
he once said : ' we all keep each other down to earth and there 's defo no way i could have done this as a solo artist			2
' i would have cracked up and given it all up and gone home by now			0
the lads keep me grounded and it 's good to know you 're not the only person going through everything			2
we 're sharing every experience			0
' in a video obtained by the @entity185 last year @entity5 was filmed smoking what looked like a ' joint ' in the back of a car with his bandmate @entity84 of course , if @entity5 was to leave the band , he would n't be the first person to quit when it all got too much			1
indeed , many have been quick to draw potential comparisons between him and @entity195			0
@entity195 famously quit @entity196 for the first time in 1995 amid rumours that his drug use had spiraled out of control			2
rumours which were later confirmed by @entity195 when he admitted to having been addicted to cocaine , saying there was a point in his life where he thought he might die			0
the singer said : ' i was so deep into addiction i knew i was probably going to die soon but i did n't care			2
' he added : ' i managed to escape by the skin of my teeth and i 'm lucky			0
i was days away from dying quite a few times on all manner of substances			0
' there could easily have been a @entity217 scenario			0
unfortunately i 've been in a place where i did n't care if i was on the planet or not			0
' although there is no evidence to suggest that @entity5 has a drug problem , he has previously been accused of substance abuse - something which he has denied			1
and last year , in a video obtained exclusively by the @entity185 , @entity5 was filmed smoking what appears to be a joint made of marijuana			1
in the footage , which is thought to have been taken by his bandmate @entity84 , the boys are driving through @entity232 in the back of a large car			0
@entity5 singing on stage with @entity7 , it is hoped that he will re-join the boys on tour next week at one point they spot a police officer riding a bike alongside their car , @entity239 is then heard saying : ' one nil b * * * h ! look at this b * * * h ! he 's having a look			1
he 's thinking , ' i 'm sure i can smell an illegal substance in there			2
' and he 's hit the nail on the head			0
' @entity239 also said : ' @entity5 takes his job very seriously			1
he makes sure he goes through a two - hour intense warm - up before every show			0
just to get himself in the zone for the show			0
' one very very important factor of @entity5 's warm up of course is @entity263 herself			1
in fact i will present it to him now for some fantastic singing			0
' @entity263 is a known nickname for marijuana			0
then , after a half - hearted attempt to film ' a bit of the culture ' with footage of the street beyond the suv , @entity239 pans back to @entity5 allowing the focus to drop to the smoking ' joint ' in his hand and asks : ' how 's that kind of culture ? ' @entity5 replies : ' it 's great			1
it 's going to be even greater culture when we get to @entity285			0
' at times , members of the band 's team can be heard talking about ' chicken '			0
at the beginning of the journey @entity239 asks ' are we all right for chicken ? ' it is n't clear what is meant by ' chicken ' as the guys joke and laugh in increasingly high spirits			0
@entity5 and his one direction bandmates found fame on the @entity3 in 2010 and have since gone on to have huge global success the boys have grown up a lot in the five years since their career first kicked off on the first occasion that chicken is mentioned one of the band 's support team can be heard saying ' we got a full chicken ' just as the crew member seated in the front passenger seat passes something back and across to his colleague seated in front of @entity239 in the six - seater suv			1
later , a member of the team can be heard saying ' i 've got an update			0
we got chicken in @entity319			0
' @entity5 and @entity320 in with much hilarity , ' we got @entity322			2
@entity322 baby ! ' in underground slang the word ' chicken ' has been used to describe quantities of cocaine			0
the term is derived from the term ' bird ' which some people use as code for a kilogram of coke			0
@entity5 is yet to make any further comment on his departure from the tour although it is hoped he will rejoin the band when they head to @entity340 next week			1
he was today photographed touching down in the @entity62 alongside one of the bands pr team and it has been reported that he will enter crisis talks during his time at home			0
@entity185 have contacted a representative for @entity5 , who said they would not be making any further comment .			2

@entity5 was this week taken off the @entity7 tour for stress
it followed photographs of him holding hands with a woman in @entity358
the woman in question was not @entity5 's fiance @entity26
however , this is not the first time concerns have been raised for the singer
last year he was caught up in a drugs scandal
and in 2013 he was accused of cheating on @entity26 with a dancer
