by @entity0 published : 10:25 est , 25 june 2013 updated : 17:39 est , 25 june 2013 @entity2 's sons may have done more harm than good this morning when they said that the racial slur scandal against their celebrity chef mom ' began as extortion and it has become character assassination '			1
now former employee @entity8 , who was suing @entity2 for discrimination and sexual harassment , is now adding another lawsuit to the mix by threatening to sue @entity13 for slander			1
' what @entity13 said was slanderous and libelous because he has accused @entity8 of a crime , ' a source close to @entity16 told @entity19			1
' it also constitutes retaliation against someone who has filed an an employment discrimination lawsuit , under the @entity25 ’s @entity24			0
' her recourse is to now sue @entity13 personally			1
' our mother was under oath asked in a deposition to pour over her entire life and to admit whether or not she had ever heard or used this word and it broke her heart to have to answer truthfully and say , yes that she had , ' @entity13 said during an interview with @entity51			1
the joint appearance was the first formal statement made by any member of the family this week following the two video statements that @entity13 released on friday			1
she was initially scheduled to be interviewed on @entity58 but failed to show up , and now she is expected to appear tomorrow morning			0
she has apologized about the claims that she used the n - word and wanted to hire an all - black waitstaff for her brother 's wedding but feared the pr - repercussions			1
' the important thing here is for people to know that that is not her heart , it is certainly not the home that we were raised in , ' @entity13 said on @entity51			2
under fire : @entity2 's testimony during a deposition has gotten her in trouble ' we were raised in a family with love and of faith and a house where @entity81 lived			0
and neither one of our parents ever taught us to be bigoted towards any other person for any reason and this is so saddening to me because our mother is one of the most compassionate , good hearted , empathetic people that you ’d ever meet			0
and these accusations are very hurtful to her and it ’s very sad			0
' his older brother @entity31 also leapt to her defense			2
it ’s completely absurd to think there is an environment of racism in our business and it 's really disrespectful to the people we work with , ' he said tuesday morning			0
' we have strong educated men and women of character that have been with us for 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 years			0
to think they would allow themselves to be in this position is simply baloney			0
' ' it was a different time when my mother was growing up			2
there 's been leaps and bounds generationally that has helped , you know , the chasm that we have of racism in this country			2
' their appearance comes just hours after the latest sponsor - @entity127 , a meat producer - cancelled their partnership with @entity2			0
financial fiasco : a number of the chef 's sponsors , including @entity127 , have withdrawn their support explaining her side : @entity13 was supposed to appear on the @entity58 on friday ( seen here at a different appearance in january ) but she did not show up and rescheduled for wednesday ' @entity13 and i are here today not to stem the tide for endorsements or any of those things			1
we 're here to speak out for our mother 's character and to say that our mother is a truly wonderful people that is inclusive of all people and spends a lot of her time and energies to help those people that are challenged , ' @entity31 said on the morning show			1
he went on to say that the millions that the @entity13 empire has raked has helped them to donate to non-profits and ‘ to do good things in our life and the power we 've been given through our media career ’			2
their mother is scheduled to make an appearance on @entity58 wednesday morning , after she failed to show up for her original appearance on friday			0
