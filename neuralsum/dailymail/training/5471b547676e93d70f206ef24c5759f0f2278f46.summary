' it ’s a part of the furniture now			2
i want it to become a family heirloom for my kids to cherish			1
' @entity7 , who works for an engineering firm , bought over 150 books on the ship so he could meticulously research every last detail to make sure his model was inch perfect			1
big paint job : @entity7 put the model in his garden when he sprayed the liner			1
he finished work on it on april 15 , the 100th anniversary of the sinking meticulous : the funnels , deck houses , fittings , masts and lifeboats were all built from scratch by @entity7 who researched the project to ensure every detail was correct luxury liner : @entity7 spent £ 2,500 on materials to build the doomed ship which was on its maiden voyage when it hit an iceberg but he admitted : ' it was a bit of trial and error			1
i had built some models before of the @entity21 , but nothing as big as this			2
' i did n’t want to build a model this size and skimp on anything			0
so i did a lot of research , looking at old pictures to make sure everything was correct			0
' most people would not even notice the detail , but i wanted to make sure that no one could pick holes in it			0
' @entity7 estimates he spent a staggering 25 hours a week working on the model			1

there were not enough for all the passengers and crew when @entity21 hit the iceberg labour of love : @entity7 spent two - and - a - half years making the model and has turned down offers worth thousands of pounds to buy it and since completing it he has already received offers in the thousands to snap it up , but rebuffed them all			1
@entity7 , who has previously built a smaller titanic and a replica of the ship as a wreck , said : ' once i finished it , the first thought on my mind was to sit back and enjoy it			1
' i wo n’t say never to selling it , but having sold two previously i just want to enjoy this one			0
' it took exactly two and a half years to make working pretty much every day			1
it shows that if you put your mind to something you can achieve it			0
' he added : ' the model definitely has the wow factor			0
people are blown away by the scale and level of detail when they see it			0
' at 11.40pm on the night of 14 april 1912 , the doomed @entity21 stuck and iceberg			0
it was on its maiden voyage from @entity156 to @entity157 when disaster struck - sinking less than 3 hours later with the loss of more than 1,500 lives , almost two - thirds of the people on board			2
the @entity21 was the largest ship afloat at the time of her maiden voyage			2
operated by the @entity168 , she was built by the @entity170 shipyard in @entity171			0
sunk : the passenger ship @entity21 which hit an iceberg as it sailed to @entity157 , claiming the lives of more than 1,500 people captained by @entity176 , her passengers included some of the wealthiest people in the world , as well as hundreds of emigrants seeking a new life in @entity184			2
the ship was designed to be the last word in comfort and luxury , with an on - board gymnasium , swimming pool , libraries , high - class restaurants and opulent cabins			2
she also had a powerful wireless telegraph provided for the convenience of passengers as well as for operational use			0
though she had advanced safety features such as watertight compartments and remotely activated watertight doors , she only had lifeboats for 1,178 people – slightly more than half of the number travelling			0
after leaving @entity156 on 10 april 1912 , @entity21 called at @entity206 in @entity207 and @entity208 ( now @entity208 ) in @entity209 before heading westwards towards @entity157			0
on 14 april 1912 , four days into the crossing and about 375 miles ( 600 km ) south of @entity212 , she hit an iceberg at 11:40 pm			0

over the next two hours and forty minutes , the ship gradually filled with water and foundered around 2:20 am			1
passengers and some crew members were evacuated in lifeboats , many of which were launched only partially filled			0
a disproportionate number of men – over 90 per cent of those in @entity232 – were left aboard because of a ' women and children first ' protocol followed by the officers loading the lifeboats			0

just under two hours after the @entity21 foundered , the @entity243 liner @entity244 arrived on the scene of the sinking , where she brought aboard an estimated 705 survivors .			2
