by @entity0 parents have hit out at a junior school which took pupils as young as nine to an art gallery displaying explicit images of naked women and dead bodies			1
children from @entity10 were invited to @entity11 in @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14 , to see their own artwork , which had been placed on display			1
but part of the visit included a tour of the gallery ’s own collection - including a collection horrifying images of women who appeared to have died violently			1

@entity44 said she was horrified that the school had deemed the gallery an appropriate place for her 10 - year - old daughter to visit			1
she fumed : ' i was mortified when i was told what she had seen			0
some of the children on the trip were as young as nine			0
' while at the gallery my daughter was shown what i would say is pornographic disturbing pictures			2
' she is 10 years old and other class friends who also went were nine years old			0
' when she came from school she told me what she had seen so i went to see the images my self			2
' as well as the pictures there is also a video of a naked man covered in white and red paint , also there where images on the wall of what was made to look like dead people			1
' i am horrified that @entity72 and the @entity73 would expose my 10 - year - old to these images			2
' scarred : children came home to their parents horrified after seeing an image of a blood - splattered bed and another of a naked woman slumped over the river bank in a series that the gallery defends as ' a visual display of fragility ' apology : the school for three - to 11 - year - olds has been forced to apologise for the trip another mother , whose 10 - year - old son was on the trip , added : ' it is a disgrace , surely they should have checked it out first			1
' that way they could have let us know what was there and each parent could have decided if they wanted their child to go			0
' my son has asked a lot of questions about death since looking at those horrible and vulgar images			0
he ’s been scarred for life			0
' it shook him up , he ’s used to watching @entity113 and @entity114 or @entity115 on the @entity116 - not seeing blood soaked naked women			1
' father - of - two @entity119 , 44 , added : ' i do n’t think it is right that a junior school is taking young children to view that sort of thing			1
' it ’s something that could corrupt young minds and stay with them for a while			0
' i can not understand their decision to take them to this sort of exhibition without doing a bit of research first			0
