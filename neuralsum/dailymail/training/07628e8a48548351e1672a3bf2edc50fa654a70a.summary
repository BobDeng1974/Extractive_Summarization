by @entity0 for the @entity1 more women will recognise the situation than will want to admit it			2
you 're young and a little tipsy , a delightful guy chats you up , you drink some more and end up at one or other 's flat			1
then you dance and laugh and drink some more ... ending up in bed together			2
in the morning , you can hardly remember what happened , let alone whether you used contraception			2
have you been there ? i have , all of 47 years ago , in my first year of university			2
and that 's the subject of a wonderful new film causing controversy in @entity28 , which has just opened here			1
obvious child tells the truth about abortion and that 's something few women would shout openly and which pro-life groups would rather suppress			1
for the fact is that for many people who have had one , including myself , an abortion is no big deal			1
not that the film treats the topic frivolously			1
the bitter - sweet comedy tells the story of how @entity47 , an edgy comedian in @entity48 who has just been dumped by her boyfriend , has a one - night stand - and then finds herself pregnant			1
at 28 , she 's better at cracking dubious jokes about flatulence and knickers in her weekly stand - up routine at a comedy club than doing her taxes			1
watching her made me wince and cringe , but she is undeniably real			0
with her parents nudging her to take control of her life , this kooky , unglamorous @entity60 girl has a lot of growing up to do			0
unsettled , immature , newly jobless and horrified at the thought of having a baby , she sees no choice - she wants an abortion			1
when the clinic advises her to think carefully about it , she replies with a seriousness we have n't yet seen : ' i have thought about it and this is what i want to do			0
' touchingly , @entity47 discovers that her super-efficient , academic mother is not furious ( as she expected )			0
she confesses that when she was a student in the @entity76 and abortions were illegal , she , too , went through the procedure			0
bitter - sweet comedy : in the controversial film , the main character becomes pregnant after a one night stand and decides to have an abortion it was the right thing for her to do at that time , she says , and she knows that it is right for her daughter			1
i realise that my use of the word ' right ' will make some people furious			0
what 's more , talking about this film requires using the words ' comedy ' and ' abortion ' in the same sentence , which is bound to greatly anger those who object to abortion on moral and religious grounds			1
@entity28 's pro-life movement has attacked the film and i 'm sure it will be controversial here , too			1
but i must point out that it does not tell a single joke about abortion			1
on the contrary , it shows a woman whose repertoire of crass jokiness covers up her inner vulnerability			0
she wants to be loved , but messes up			0
i recognise @entity47 - she is like so many people i 've known and others who write to my saturday advice column			0
because of that i certainly do n't judge her			0
when you reach the tender ending of the film , you realise that her decision to have an abortion as early as possible was wise and , yes , right			1
this is not about a ' lifestyle choice '			0
it is about realising that the decision to bring a child into this world is the most serious you can make			1
which is worse : to bring an unwanted baby into a chaotic life or to terminate the pregnancy at the earliest possible moment ? right to choose : bel with newborn daughter @entity136 in 1980 - months before she had an abortion unfortunately , far too many young women make the first choice , and society is paying an appalling price			1
to me , the ' crime ' is being reckless with your fertility and then irresponsibly and stupidly dithering so long about an unwanted pregnancy that an abortion is carried out very late			2
i would probably support a move to legislate that the abortion limit of 24 weeks ( established in 1990 ) is too high			2
but i still have no doubt that women have the right to choose an early abortion and that they are usually wise to do so			2
one of the most interesting things about @entity17 is that @entity47 's feelings about abortion are not over-dramatised			1
i have received letters to my advice column expressing guilt at abortions carried out years earlier - and naturally i sympathise			0
what else can i do ? yet there is another side : those women who know they have made the right decision and vow to get on with their lives			2
in a touching and true moment in the film , @entity47 asks her supportive best friend , who had an abortion years earlier , whether she thinks about it often			1
she replies without hesitation : ' i think about it sometimes - once in a while - and then i get sad			0
but i never regret it			0
' i can honestly say i 've never felt sad about having a very early termination at the end of 1980			2
my son was born in 1974 , smaller than average and treated in special care			0
then in 1975 i endured 16 hours of labour delivering a stillborn son at full term			0
in january 1980 , i had my daughter prematurely by caesarean section , contracted a dangerous infection and heard a succession of bleak warnings from doctors about my baby 's health			1
the prognosis was uncertain and the future looked frightening and exhausting in equal measure - though at the time i had no way of predicting just how hard it would be			0
that 's why , 11 months after my daughter 's birth and pregnant again at the age of 34 , i was so relieved to hear my new gp tell me : ' if you were my daughter , i would counsel a termination			2
' we 'd moved house to give the children a better life in the country , i 'd mislaid my pills during the chaos and bingo			0
like @entity47 in the film , i was thoughtful , but determined about having an abortion			1
and from that day until this , i have never experienced a moment of regret about that decision			2
for the sake of my health and in order to care for my sick child , it was the right thing to do			2
the night before the abortion , @entity47 has a gig at the comedy club			1
her chaotic life is the material for her act , but this time she plays it almost straight and tells her audience about the pregnancy and abortion			1
@entity232 , pictured with her son in 1979 , does not regret having an abortion a year after this picture was taken you can sense that the women in the audience are relieved to hear such honesty and the men respond to it , too , with warm applause			1
i found it moving when she concludes her act : ' i think it 's gon na be ok and afterwards ... i 'll be in my future ... and , you know , we 'll go from there			2
' it seems to me that such an attitude is healthy			0
sometimes i feel frustrated by the modern tendency to rachet up every single emotional upset into a trauma that will require counselling and scar you for ever			0
equally irritating is the refusal to admit there are degrees of seriousness , which is why when a judge or commentator suggests that date rape is less horrific than gang rape there is an hysterical outcry of indignation			0
i believe it diminishes the very real suffering of parents who have nursed a sick child who dies in their arms to treat an early miscarriage or abortion ( and i have had both ) as a life - changing heartache you will nurse for ever			1
people suffer terrible things and somehow continue to live with courage and determination			0
no advice columnist likes thoughtless cliches such as ' get over it ' and ' move on '			0
do you agree with @entity232 - or think her attitude is callous ? we want to hear your views and personal stories			1
please email : @entity290 - box text yet sometimes we have to accept what happens to us - accept the sadness as well as the change and continue with life			0
that 's what obvious child makes you realise : we all make mistakes and have to deal with the consequences , but that does n't mean there is no possibility of a happy ending			1
you have to embrace the fact you will be ' in your future ' - and cope			0
just as i did , and just as many thousands of women have , whether they will admit it or not			0

obvious child , a film causing controversy in @entity28 , has just opened here
tells the story of a comedian who has an abortion after a one night stand
@entity232 understands the character 's decision
she had an abortion in 1980
writes here how she has never regretted the decision
