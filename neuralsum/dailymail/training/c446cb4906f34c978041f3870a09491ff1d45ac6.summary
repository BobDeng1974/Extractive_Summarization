@entity0 embark on 12 months crammed with cricket knowing they still have much to do to show they have recovered from the year that ripped them apart			2
the tumultuous events of 2014 , culminating with the sacking of @entity8 as one - day captain on the brink of a @entity11 , give way to a non-stop diet of high profile competition that will make or break their still unproven new regime			1
@entity17 left @entity18 on tuesday with the prospect of his second coming as @entity0 coach being defined by how they fare during a year that includes a @entity11 , the @entity24 and high profile series against @entity26 and @entity27			1
@entity0 coach @entity17 says sacking @entity8 as @entity29 captain was ' the right thing to do ' only if @entity0 make significant progress in the hectic months ahead will the jury that is still out on both @entity17 and managing director @entity32 return not guilty verdicts on the massive changes that have swept through the game			1
the green shoots of recovery that saw @entity0 win three tests against @entity40 must now fully blossom if the fall - out which claimed @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and , in one - day cricket at least , @entity8 is to prove fully justified			1
@entity0 , who left for @entity47 yesterday and a @entity49 triangular series against @entity50 and @entity40 , are not expected to make much of an impact in the 50 - over game that they still struggle to master after all these years			1
yet if a mediocre @entity11 – and they really should make the quarter - finals – is followed by stuttering form in the @entity56 and beyond then the rancour that has enveloped them since their @entity24 debacle will claim yet more victims			2
@entity17 , who has had to take over on the back of two 5 - 0 thrashings by @entity50 , travels with @entity0 still adamant that they have the ‘ outstanding coach of his generation ’ at the helm for their busiest ever year			1
@entity17 , speaking before @entity0 flew to @entity50 , says the @entity8 decision was brave but necessary yet their backing for @entity8 , both publicly and privately , was total until they ruthlessly cut him adrift after the 5 - 2 one - day defeat in @entity71 so a vote of confidence in @entity17 will only stretch so far into the multiple challenges ahead			1
@entity17 is adamant that @entity0 travel with expectation as well as hope in their hearts			2
‘ we are going to @entity50 to win it , ’ he said of his @entity11 outsiders			1
‘ we know 2014 was tough , with the highlight of winning three tests in a row against @entity40 , but we ’ve not had a move forward yet in one - day cricket			2
‘ we will attack the tri-series and the @entity11 with a view to making the public excited about watching @entity0 play			1
this trip will be about @entity0 winning and not us making excuses			2
’ this one - day venture will certainly be a tall order			0
three and a half years of planning were ripped up when @entity8 was jettisoned at the last possible moment and replaced by a batsman in @entity94 who is in even worse one - day form			1
@entity0 fast bowlers @entity97 ( right ) and @entity98 embrace before check - in on tuesday @entity17 was adamant that @entity8 was still the right man for the job right up to the fateful selection meeting last month when it became clear that the man @entity0 have invested so much in had finally run out of one - day chances			1
‘ the goal we set going back eight months was to have the best 15 players going to the tri-series and then the @entity11			2
i think we ’ve got that but unfortunately for @entity8 he missed out at the last part of that , ’ said @entity17			2
‘ it ’s a tough one on @entity8 but we can look back and say he had every opportunity to try to get himself on the plane			0
plans are there to be changed at times			0
we ’d got to a position where it felt like the right thing to do			0
‘ it was a brave decision to change it , we moved on as a set of selectors and i ’m comfortable with that			0
i think we ’ve got the right people on the plane and we ’ve got to go there now and perform			0
we saw some good individual performances in @entity71 but it is the team ’s performance that counts now and we ’ve got to go there with a strong focus to try to win the @entity11			0
’ @entity8 ( left ) remains @entity0 's @entity135 skipper and will lead the side to the @entity137 after the @entity11 the scale of their task is summed up by the fact that four players who could feature in their first choice team – @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 - have 37 one - day caps between them while a key figure for group opponents @entity71 in @entity152 has almost 400 more on his own			1
yet @entity0 changed tact late on before their 2010 @entity155 victory and their chances of causing an upset this time can not really be harmed by the promotion of a canny and imaginative captain in @entity94			1
‘ it will be exciting to work with @entity94 and i think he ’ll bring a lot to the team , ’ said @entity17			0
‘ i think he ’ll be a straight - forward captain which will be a good thing for us and will have a strong desire to go out there and show not only what he can do but also what the team can do			2
‘ @entity94 had a great time the last time he went to @entity50 with @entity0 and he ’ll be desperately keen to make sure he fires as captain			1
he ’s not only a fantastic one - day player but also has a one - day mind - set in the way he goes about his cricket			0
he ’ll certainly be up for the challenge			0
’ @entity94 , who 's been playing for the @entity181 's @entity180 , will lead @entity0 at the @entity11 it is fascinating to ponder how many of @entity0 ’s players will still be standing this time next year after a gruelling schedule put together by greedy administrators with no thought to the well - being of players nor the quality of the product that spectators pay good money for			1
yet @entity17 was bullish about 12 months ahead that @entity194 for one calculates will see him spend 321 nights in hotel rooms if he somehow manages to stay fit and well for all the cricket that lies ahead in all its forms			0
‘ my message to the players is let ’s go for it , get in there , and play good , hard cricket , ’ said @entity17			0
‘ and let ’s enjoy representing our country			0
that goes for the whole year and if at any time anybody feels they ca n’t do that then let ’s move them on because that ’s what playing for your country is all about			0
’ the next 12 months will decide whether @entity17 is still around to make the same rallying call this time next year			0
