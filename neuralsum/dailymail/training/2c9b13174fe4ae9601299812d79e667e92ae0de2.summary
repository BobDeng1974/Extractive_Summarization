during the @entity2 period , the rauisuchid predator ruled the land while the phytosaur was the master of the sea - and experts have long believed the two large reptiles lived separate lives			1
but , a tooth found embedded in the leg bone of the land - dwelling rauisuchid may cast doubts on this theory			1
the 220 - million - year old tooth is said to have belonged to the semi-aquatic phytosaur and was left in the thigh bone following a savage battle between the two creatures			1
to study the tooth , without destroying the bone , researchers used computed tomography ( @entity21 ) scans to build a 3d model of it ( pictured in blue )			2
a selection of other , fossilised phytosaur teeth are pictured			2
the tooth was found in the bone of a rauisuchid , a large land reptile			1
until now , experts did not think the creatures interacted and multiple wounds suggest the two beasts may have clashed regularly , despite their different habitats			1
@entity34 typically had large heads , sharp teeth , long hind legs , and scales on their backs			0
they measured up to 25ft ( 7.6 metres ) tall , with 2ft ( 0.6 metres ) long heads			0
by comparison , the phytosaur , which means ‘ plant lizard ’ , typically grew to 6ft ( 2 metres ) long			2
professor @entity44 , of the @entity45 , said : ‘ to find a phytosaur tooth in the bone of a rauisuchid is very surprising			1
‘ these rauisuchids were the largest predators in their environments			1
‘ you might expect them to be the top predators as well , but here we have evidence of phytosaurs , who were smaller , semi-aquatic animals , potentially targeting and eating these big carnivores			1
’ a model skeleton of a phytosaur is pictured in the @entity62 , @entity63			2
experts believe the semi-acquatic creatures had 166 teeth and were predators of the @entity68 and @entity69 @entity34 typically had large heads , sharp teeth , long hind legs , and scales on their backs			1
they measured up to to 25ft ( 7.6 metres ) long , with 2ft ( 0.6 metres ) long heads			0
they were considered one of the most dangerous predators of the @entity68 and @entity69			2
rauisuchids were reptiles , but they resembled dinosaurs so closely that they are often mistaken for dinosaur ancestors			2
by comparison , phytosaurs resembled modern - day crocodiles			2
they had short legs , wide , heavy bodies with rows of armoured scales , long tails , and long toothy snouts			0
these teeth were sharp and cone - shaped			2
the name phytosaur means ‘ plant lizard ’ , and they typically grew to 39ft ( 12 metres ) long			0
they were considered one of largest water predators of the @entity2			1
although the bone was dug up in the western @entity102 , at the time the @entity2 reptiles would have been roaming the super continent @entity104 , which was just beginning to break up into the individual land masses we see today			1
it challenges beliefs about the lifestyles of these ancient creatures , who were distant relatives of modern - day crocodiles that would have towered over the early dog - sized dinosaurs			1
some lived on land , while others lived in water - and it was believed , until now , that they did n’t interact			1
the analysis of the bite marks in two thigh bones suggests both predator species at the top of their respective food chains not only crossed paths , but the smaller creature may have potentially eaten the larger			1
@entity34 typically had large heads , sharp teeth , long hind legs , and scales on their @entity133 measured up to 25ft ( 7.6 metres ) tall , with 2ft ( 0.6 metres ) long heads			0
the polonosuchus - a genus of rauisuchian - is pictured the bones are stored at the @entity137 , @entity138			0
to study the tooth , without destroying the bone , the researchers used computed tomography ( @entity21 ) scans to build a 3d model			0
this , along with an examination of the bite marks , revealed a story of multiple struggles			0
the team found tissue surrounding the bite marks revealed the rauisuchid was attacked twice and survived			0
but , evidence of crushing , impact and flesh - stripping , without healing , showed the animal later died in another attack			0
by comparison , the crocodile - like phytosaur , which means ‘ plant lizard ’ , typically grew to 6ft ( 2 metres ) long			1
this image is an illustration of the belodon - a genus of the phytosaur professor @entity44 said : ‘ finding teeth embedded directly in fossil bone is very , very rare			1
‘ this is the first time it has been identified among phytosaurs , and it gives us a smoking gun for interpreting this set of bite marks			0
’ the findings also suggest previous distinctions between water and land - based food chains from this time , the @entity178 , might be built upon mistaken assumptions made from fossil remains			1
@entity186 dr @entity185 , of @entity187 , added : ‘ this research will call for us to go back and look at some of the assumptions we have had in regard to the @entity69 ecosystems			0
‘ the aquatic and terrestrial distinctions made were oversimplified , and i think we have made a case the two spheres were intimately connected			0
’ the research also calls into question the importance of size in a fight			0
added professor @entity44 : ‘ both of the femora we examined came from some of the physically largest carnivorous species present at both locations			0
‘ yet they were targeted by other members of the region , specifically phytosaurs			0
thus , size can not be the only factor in determining who is at the top of the food chain			0

the tooth was embedded in the leg of a land - based rauisuchid
it is said to have belonged to a semi-aquatic reptile called a phytosaur
the two creatures were predators of their respective environments during the @entity2 period
however , until now , experts did not think the reptiles ever interacted
finding suggests they battled , and may have come to blows multiple times
