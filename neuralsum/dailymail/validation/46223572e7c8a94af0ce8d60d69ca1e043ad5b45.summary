the race for places in the @entity2 among the @entity4 's top clubs has just become more urgent after @entity5 announced significant increases in prize money for their top competition from next season			1
cash for appearing in the group stages onwards is leaping by up to 50 per cent , and for @entity14 clubs there will also be steep hikes in ' market pool ' money from @entity5 's tv incomes			1
the upshot is that if an @entity14 club were to win next season 's @entity2 , they would earn around € 100m ( or £ 74m at today 's exchange rates ) from central @entity5 funds alone			1
ticket income plus any commercial bonuses income would be on top			0
@entity29 's financial reward for retaining the @entity2 would be even bigger than last year @entity31 's @entity2 exit at the hands of @entity33 has cost them a share of more lucrative prize money to put that in context , @entity37 's highest - earning club in last season 's @entity2 was @entity40 , who earned € 44.8m ( £ 33m ) from @entity5 for reaching the quarter - finals			1
as things stand , the four @entity2 slots for next season are filled by @entity31 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity40 - with that quartet the favourites to reach @entity5 's top club competition			1
but @entity51 in fifth , @entity52 in sixth and @entity53 in seventh will still hold out hopes they can finish strongly and perhaps squeak into the top four			1
never has that fourth place been so lucrative			0
under current prize money arrangements , clubs reaching the group stage receive € 8.6m ( £ 6.4m ) each plus € 1m ( £ 750,000 ) per group win and € 0.5m ( £ 370,000 ) per draw			1
the basic fee will rise 40 per cent to € 12m ( £ 8.9m ) and each win will jump 50 per cent to € 1.5m ( £ 1.1m )			0
prize money for reaching the last 16 , quarter - finals and semi-finals will leap up to 57 per cent , respectively to £ 4m , £ 4.44m and £ 5.2m			2
the prize for being tournament runner - up will jump from € 6.5m ( £ 4.8m ) to € 10.5m ( £ 7.8m ) while the winner 's prize will jump from € 10.5m ( 7.8m ) to € 15m ( £ 11.11m )			0
@entity72 will have extra reason to celebrate if @entity47 qualify for the @entity2 next season @entity40 won £ 33m after losing their quarter - final last year - but that will soon look relatively small @entity77 and @entity78 will now be even more desperate to finish in the top four this term @entity46 flopped again among @entity5 's elite , but they are set for another windfall next season the most any team will be able to win will from ' basic ' prize cash - before tv market share cash - will jump from € 37.4m ( £ 27.7m ) to € 54.5 ( £ 40.4m ) , a hike of 46 per cent			1
yet it is the market pool money that promises to surge for @entity14 clubs especially , because @entity91 's £ 897m three - year deal with @entity5 for all @entity93 club football kicks in next season , and is worth double what @entity95 previously paid			2
a lot of the increase , if not all , will filter to the @entity14 clubs in the @entity2			0
last season the four @entity14 clubs shared around € 70m ( £ 52m ) in market pool cash , on top of performance cash , with @entity40 getting most , at € 24m ( £ 17.8m )			2
from next season , the total sum to @entity14 clubs is expected to leap by between 50 and 75 per cent , to between € 105m ( £ 78m ) and € 125m ( £ 93m ) , with exact amounts to be confirmed			0
the biggest single @entity14 earner could get as much as € 40m ( £ 30m ) of that pot alone , and more if only three clubs made it to the group stages			2
@entity111 won the @entity112 last season , and @entity5 's second - tier club competition is getting a cash boost the likes of @entity53 will benefit from the extra @entity112 cash , if they do not finish in the top four whichever way the sums are calculated , being in the @entity2 is about to become hugely more lucrative for @entity14 teams in particular			1
prize money for the @entity112 will also rise but it will remain very much the junior club competition			0
currently for every pound @entity5 give in prize money to @entity112 clubs , @entity2 clubs get £ 4.30			1
from next season the ratio will narrow to 3.3 to 1 from 4.3 to 1			0
but the highest - earning club in the lesser tournament will still only be able to earn a maximum of € 15.3m ( £ 11.3m )			0
' @entity5 is really pleased that the new distribution system not only provides for a substantial rise in monies received by clubs participating in the @entity2 and @entity112 , but also strengthens @entity5 's solidarity principle , namely ensuring an even more substantial increase in solidarity payments to clubs , ' said @entity5 general secretary @entity140			2
' in this way , the new system provides a better deal for everyone , especially those clubs which did not qualify to the group stage of either of the two @entity5 club competitions			0
this is a perfect example of the proper implementation of the solidarity principle which forms an essential part of @entity5 's key values			0

@entity2 prize money has been boosted by @entity5
appearance money from group stages on will go up by 50 per cent
extra ticket money on offer also means huge increase in potential rewards
@entity31 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity40 are in pole position to qualify next season
@entity51 , @entity53 and @entity52 are still hopeful of top four finish
