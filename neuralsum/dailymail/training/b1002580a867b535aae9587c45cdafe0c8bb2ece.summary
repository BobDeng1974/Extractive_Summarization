drivers who think their cunning short - cuts save time in the rush hour are kidding themselves , experts have revealed			1
in fact , using a so - called rat run to bypass gridlock on bigger roads is more likely to make a commute longer			1
congestion at the busiest times on smaller roads is twice as bad as on main highways , according to research by satnav experts @entity15			1
using a so - called rat run to bypass gridlock on bigger roads is more likely to make a commute longer , according to research by satnav experts @entity15 its annual congestion report revealed that traffic jams in @entity22 cities have become worse , with average journeys in 2013 taking 27 per cent longer than they would in free - flowing traffic – up from 26 per cent in 2012			1
@entity15 says @entity22 commuters spend the equivalent of ten working days a year stuck in traffic , up from nine a year ago			1
but those clever little escape routes on which millions of drivers pride themselves to escape the worst of the jams are most likely a false economy , say the experts			2
and the reluctance of motorists to believe that may be down to drivers preferring to ‘ feel ’ as if they are on the move and in control – even if it takes longer in reality – to the helpless feeling of moving at snail ’s pace in slow moving traffic			2
the @entity15 research notes : ‘ drivers using rat runs may actually be making their journeys slower			1
the data shows that local roads have twice as much lost travel time ( 32 % ) as main roads ( 15 % )			1
’ @entity15 spokesman @entity56 said : ‘ many motorists are very proud to tell others about their secret rat - run that helps them avoid the worst of the rush - hour gridlock			1
but the reality is that it probably takes them longer			2
’ @entity15 says @entity22 commuters spend the equivalent of ten working days a year stuck in traffic , up from nine days one year ago he said satnav systems update traffic information every two minutes and are more accurate measure of near real - time conditions			1
‘ it may be counter-intuitive , but the satnavs really are more accurate			0
but when you are sitting in a jam it may not feel that way at the time , ' he said			2
‘ psychologically , people want to keep moving , or at least feel they are moving and in control			0
so they will often use their favourite rat - run to ‘ get around ’ the problem , even if it takes longer or the traffic moves even slower on the local roads than on the major roads which they ’ve just left			1
on average the local roads move at half the pace			2
’ mr @entity56 said : ‘ pride and ego is also at stake			0
people do like to tell others about how they have beaten the traffic , even if in reality they have n’t			2
some drivers do simply think they know best and wo n’t be convinced otherwise			0
but the satnav is a better predictor			2
’ @entity97 president @entity96 agreed that rat - runs often do take longer – but feel better			1
he said : ‘ it is largely psychological			0
people do like to feel they are moving			0
you see it on clogged and congested motorways like the @entity104			0
some drivers divert off the motorway to find an alternative route along local roads			0
but often they ’d get to their destination quicker if they just stayed on the congested and slow - moving main route			0
’ @entity111 was the most congested city , with the worst periods 36per cent more congested than the free - flowing ones			0
@entity114 and @entity115 were the next worst - congested cities , followed by @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity121 - @entity120 and @entity122			0
of the 17 biggest cities , only two were less jammed in 2013 than in 2012 , with congestion worsening in 10 and staying the same in the other five			0
the biggest increases in congestion were in @entity122 and @entity128			0
the company also released world - city figures , which showed @entity131 was the most - congested destination , followed by @entity133 and @entity134 , which will be one of the main football @entity137 venues this summer			0
traffic experts estimate that time lost as a result of traffic congestion costs the @entity22 economy £ 2billion a year and warn that it is set to get worse despite a £ 28billion plan for road improvements in the @entity22			1
the government has forecast four million more drivers on @entity22 roads by 2030 and that , by 2040 , the volume of traffic will have risen by 40per cent .			1

short - cuts do not save time in rush hour , say satnav experts @entity15
using rat runs to bypass gridlock on bigger roads make a commute longer
