by @entity0 a primary school named in honour of a @entity4 hero who was killed in action is facing criticism after changing its name to shake off its ' association with failure '			1
@entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , was placed in special measures in 2012 and then removed after becoming an @entity14 earlier this year			1
as a result trustees decided earlier this month to rename it @entity14 because they believed its previous name was associated with its own ‘ legacy of failure ’ but angry parents , historians and relatives of the gallant soldier - who sacrificed his life for his country 70 years ago at the age of just 21 - have hit out at the move and branded it an insult to his memory			1
a primary school named in honour of @entity4 hero @entity34 ( pictured ) has been criticised after changing its name			1
mr @entity34 was awarded the @entity35 for bravery in the @entity37 @entity38 , the niece of @entity34 , is worried ' everybody will forget ' about her war hero uncle @entity34 was awarded the @entity35 posthumously in november 1944 for bravery during the @entity37 just months earlier in september 1944			1
he died while single - handedly fighting off @entity44 tanks after the rest of his regiment had been killed			0
@entity34 fought with the 2nd @entity47 in @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 and commanded two anti-tank guns at @entity37			1
having come under heavy fire from the @entity55 most of the regiment were forced back but @entity34 ’s section dug themselves in and fought			0
all his fellow soldiers were killed leaving @entity34 to man two anti tank guns to hold off the advancing @entity55			0
despite his actions , by the time the @entity59 sent a third wave of troops a @entity55 tank destroyed his position with a single shot tragically killing him in the process			0
@entity67 , in @entity68 , has now changed its name to @entity70 's @entity14 trustees at the school have said they decided on the rebrand because they believed the school 's name was associated with ' a legacy of failure ' the young soldier ’s body was never recovered but he was awarded the @entity35 a few months after his death and a statue put up in his honour in @entity11 in 1990			1
his niece @entity38 , 65 , from @entity84 , today said : ' nobody will remember him , everybody will forget and it will get pushed under the carpet			0
' she said : ' it was all done in his memory and now that has gone so it is really disappointing			0
it is heartbreaking really when you think about it and we had no warning at all			0
i was quite taken aback			0
' he was my father 's younger brother and there were two sisters and another brother in total			2
' i learnt a lot about him through the family so although i never met him i felt i knew a bit about him			0
@entity34 's niece @entity38 today said : ' young people need genuine heroes to look up to and my uncle was the ideal role model ' ' it just made you proud to think of what he had done and it was nice to know he is recognised			1
' it is a real shame the school has changed because now he will go from peoples ' minds and people will just forget what @entity34 did			1
no one will know in a few years ' time and that is a great tragedy			0
' young people need genuine heroes to look up to and my uncle was the ideal role model			2
' distant relative @entity132 , 65 , added : ' we have not got many heroes and it is good for children to have a sense of history			2
' i was very proud of having a @entity140 school			2
this decision is very silly and short - sighted			2
' instead of being associated with a @entity35 winner , those children will grow up associated with a saint i have certainly never heard of - and i read the @entity145			1
' the young soldier 's body was never recovered but he was awarded the @entity35 a few months after his death and a statue put up in his honour in @entity11 in 1990 the school has now officially adopted the new name after being awarded academy status on march 1			1
defending the decision executive principal @entity154 said : ' the trust is confident the school is moving from strength to strength			1
' we have come out of special measures by becoming an academy but the school has a way to go			2
' to continue with the @entity34 name would have continued with that legacy of failure			1
' to have that legacy of failure associated with a local @entity35 winner was n’t particularly good for him either			1
' they have thrown away the memory of a local war hero			1
the new name means nothing to the children ' - @entity174 , who has two grandchildren at the school ' we are a church school and the name reflects that ethos			1
we are in partnership with @entity181 ’s @entity14			2
' @entity181 is the name of one of @entity185 ’ disciples and @entity186 is the name given to @entity188 in @entity34 ’s gospel so we thought it was a good name			0
' mr @entity154 added the decision had also been made because some people thought the @entity35 - which stood for @entity35 - meant ‘ voluntary controlled ’ instead			1
but parent @entity193 , 33 , from @entity11 , said : ' the kids all knew about @entity34 and what he did for this country			0
he is @entity68 ’s proudest son			2
' in such a poignant year 70 years since d - day the children should be learning about that - not a saint that nobody has heard of			2
' i ’ve spoke to many parents and nobody really knows who @entity70 is			1
' it is a disgrace to the memory of one of the city ’s finest war heroes that he has his name and his legacy stripped away from the school			1
troops under fire at the @entity37 on the @entity217 / @entity55 border in september 1944 ' it ’s callous and cold - hearted and his family must be devastated			1
@entity34 would be turning in his grave			0
' how on earth can you associate the name of a @entity4 hero with failure ? they have lost their marbles			1
' @entity174 , 50 , who has two grandchildren at the school , said : ' they have thrown away the memory of a local war hero			1
the new name means nothing to the children			2
' they need to change the standards not the name			0
' the school was named after the lance sergeant who was awarded the @entity35 posthumously in november 1944 for bravery during the @entity37 in september of the same year			1
after initially becoming a butcher @entity34 was called up to the army in 1942 , joining the @entity244 and serving with the @entity246 's anti-tank platoon			2
the school 's executive principal @entity154 said : ' to continue with the @entity34 name would have continued with that legacy of failure ' he served in @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 before fighting in the @entity37			1
he was involved in the fierce confrontation near @entity252 , @entity253 , in september 1944 , which saw most of the regiment being forced back			0
@entity34 's section then mounted a serious defence of their positions , digging in near a road junction			0
his companions were all killed , while he was also badly injured in the leg			0
this however did not prevent him from bravely holding off the entire @entity55 troop single - handedly , in the hope of being able to attract the attention of nearby @entity268 soldiers			0
' we have come out of special measures by becoming an academy but the school has a way to go			0
to continue with the @entity34 name would have continued with that legacy of failure ' - executive principal @entity154 the @entity55 renewed their onslaught and continued to attack the position held by @entity34 alone , as no help arrived			2
he destroyed two armoured cars before a @entity55 tank destroyed his position in a single @entity284 was killed in the process			0
the @entity37 was part of @entity286 , a bid by @entity268 forces to break through @entity55 lines and take bridges in occupied @entity291 operation itself was turned into a 1977 epic war film , called @entity293 , based on the book by @entity295 , starring @entity296 , @entity297 , @entity298 , @entity299 and @entity300			1
local historian @entity301 said : ' i was very pleased when the school adopted the name of @entity140 , it recognised and acknowledged as a tribute to the amazing story of a local hero			2
' it is a pity that they feel the need now to drop that name			0
' @entity313 ’s @entity14 is a mixed school and has 420 pupils aged from three to 11			1
@entity316 ’s inspection in november last year revealed the school ’s progress since being placed in special measures was inadequate and progress since the previous monitoring inspection was satisfactory			0
@entity68 said the school was opened in 2001 as the ' @entity10 '			1
the @entity37 was known at the time as @entity286			2
it was one of the boldest plans of @entity4 and , if it had succeeded , would have ensured the war ended by @entity326			1
a total of 30,000 @entity329 and @entity330 airborne troops were to be flown behind enemy lines in september 1944 to capture the eight bridges that spanned the @entity217 @entity55 border			0
@entity329 tanks and infantry were to meet the airborne troops at the bridges and cross them			0
the @entity37 was one of the boldest plans of @entity4 and , if it had succeeded , would have ensured the war ended by @entity326 the plan was conceived after the d - day landings in june 1944 by general @entity341 , commander of the @entity329 forces in @entity343			1
over three days , the @entity268 airborne forces tried to parachute in , while tanks and infantry made their way to the bridges			0
they were surrounded by @entity55 troops and were eventually forced to fight their way out			0
almost 2,000 @entity329 soldiers were killed and 6,854 captured - a disastrous defeat for the @entity268			0
@entity55 artillery controlled the river and only 2,500 @entity329 soldiers made it out alive			0
it would be another four months before the @entity358 crossed the @entity359 again in early 1945			0
the war dragged on for another seven months until september 1945 .			0

@entity10 renamed @entity70 's @entity14
relatives of @entity4 hero have been angered by the decision
historians and parents of school children were also furious at the move
war hero was awarded @entity35 for role in @entity37 in 1944
@entity10 , in @entity68 , said it changed its name to shake off ' legacy of failure '
