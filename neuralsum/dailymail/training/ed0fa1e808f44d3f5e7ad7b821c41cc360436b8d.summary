a ' detoother ' is n't a doctor but a gold - digger and a ' side - dish ' certainly is n't something served by a waiter - it 's a mistress			2
these , along with phrases such as ' spewing out buffalos ' - which means that you ca n't speak proper @entity10 - are just a few examples of @entity13 's unusual , locally - adapted language called ' @entity14			1
' and for the first time , the unusual @entity13 version of adapted @entity10 is set to be published in dictionary form			1
@entity18 , a popular , locally - adapted @entity10 language will be published in dictionary form for the first time ' it is so entrenched right now that , even when you think you can not use it , you actually find yourself speaking @entity18 , ' @entity21 , the author of the first @entity18 dictionary , told @entity27			1
' even as i was researching , i was surprised that these words are not @entity10 because they were the only ones i knew			2
' a word like a ' campuser ' - a university student - i used to think was an @entity10 word			2
' @entity18 : a dictionary of @entity13 @entity10 , which went on sale in bookshops across the east @entity36 country late last year , contains hundreds of popular @entity18 terms , some coined by @entity13 as far back as the colonial period			1
author of the first @entity18 dictionary , @entity21 , used to this ' campuser ' - a university student - was actually a real @entity10 word @entity21 , 32 , said the informal phrases were greatly influenced by the local @entity46 language , and is a ' symptom of a serious problem with our education system ' that he claims has been deteriorating since the 1990s			1
@entity14 is largely dependent on sentences being literally translated from local dialects with little regard for context , while vocabulary used is derived from standard @entity10			1
meantime , @entity21 says , influence from the @entity60 , local media and musicians have seen additional words and phrases created and slowly enter the lexicon			2
the result is colourful but at times confusing expressions			0
the language is pervasive in all parts of the country , resulting in colourful , confusing expressions if you have n't seen someone for a while , for example , you 're ' lost ' , while if you ' design well ' , you are snappy dresser			2
today , @entity18 is used by people from all walks of life , but particularly popular with youths			0
however , @entity10 is still the country 's working language , and it remains the only medium of instruction in schools and in official business			1
but @entity21 said everyone from the president to simple farmers speak at least some @entity18 , which varies according to region , tribe and gender , and is regularly seen on signposts			1
' mps are almost notorious at using @entity14 , you see it in parliamentary debates , ' said @entity21			1
it 's so prevalent , in fact , that it 's even used in @entity98 ! @entity93 are notorious for using @entity14 in debates but it was n't until 2011 , a year after the term @entity18 - pronounced ' you - glish ' - had been coined on social media , that @entity104 began keeping newspaper cuttings , conducting interviews and searching online for material for his book			1
' i knew that people talked a lot about this , and my friends used to laugh about it , ' said the author , who also works for a think tank , which often takes him to the far reaches of the country			0
his book contains a brief history of @entity18 , and a glossary of terms relating to education , telecommunications , society and lifestyle , food , transport , sex and relationships			0
one phrase commonly used when discussing the latter is ' live sex , ' which means unprotected sex - a term thought to have derived from the live @entity137 football games @entity13 love to watch			2
' when the ministry of health is doing campaigns to warn young people against unprotected sex , they use ' live sex ' , because everybody will understand it , ' said @entity21			0
on the same subject , if you 're a ' side - dish ' , you are someone 's mistress			0
following the dictionary 's release , so many more phrases have been suggested that @entity104 has decided to do a second edition @entity21 's book has proven popular among the middle class , including academics , and with locals and foreigners alike			1
to date he 's sold about a thousand copies			0
' i 've had incredible feedback from professional linguists , ordinary readers - some even suggesting more phrases - so i 'll be doing another edition , ' said @entity21			2
' i do n't see it disappearing			0
i 'm looking forward to seeing five years from now how many new words and phrases have joined the lexicon , ' he said , adding some teachers , particularly in state schools , are passing @entity14 on to their students			0
though @entity10 is the country 's language of instruction , @entity14 is extremely popular with young people but , as the author stresses in the final chapter of his book , there comes a point when @entity14 stops being funny			1
in 1997 @entity13 introduced universal primary school education , which eliminated official school fees and made education accessible to millions more children			0
but literacy rates remain low : more than a quarter of the population can not read or write , according to the @entity186 , and critics say standards remain low in many schools			0
' @entity18 is not something that should be encouraged , particularly for young , impressionable children , ' he concluded			0
' they really should learn what they call proper standard @entity10			0

@entity14 is @entity13 's strange , locally - adapted @entity10 language
@entity21 has authored the first @entity18 dictionary
usage is so pervasive that even mps use it in parliamentary debate
