but unlike @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 , you wo n't possess them all at once			0
the average woman will own 372 cardigans and 558 pairs of trousers during her adult life , according to new research			1
the average woman will , over her adult lifetime , own 434 pairs of shoes , according to @entity23 a recent study from @entity26 celebrity fashion website mycelebrityfashion.co.uk revealed how many items of clothing a woman is likely to go through between the ages of 18 and 80			1
surveying women aged over 18 around the @entity26 , the website found the average number of each item of clothing a woman buys per year , with tops coming out on , er , top with 18 per year , dresses second at ten per year , and trousers and jeans coming third , with the average woman buying nine pairs every year			2
unless you are @entity12 , a woman is likely to go through seven pairs of shoes every year , six cardigans or jumpers , five skirts and four coats or jackets			2
when taking into consideration the averages revealed by the respondents , as well as the fact that a woman 's adult lifetime is , on average , 62 years from the age of 18 , it appears that women own on average , in a lifetime , 1,116 tops , 620 dresses , 310 skirts , 372 cardigans / jumpers , 558 trousers orjeans , 248 coats or jackets and 434 pair of shoes			1
most women will own 1,117 tops in a life time - probably far fewer than the number already owned by celebrity poppets @entity11 , left , and @entity12 , right over a quarter of the respondents ( 27 per cent ) , described their clothes shopping habits as ' impulsive ' , while 39 per cent admitted to buying ' in bulk ' during sales			0
@entity82 , editor of mycelebrityfashion.co.uk , commented : ' when looking at the bigger picture , you certainly would not imagine owning this many clothing items in your lifetime ! ' it does n't seem like a lot at the time , when you buy the odd dress or jacket , but when it 's all put together you do realise the amount you accumulate ! it would be quite interesting to find out how many different clothing items men buy in their lifetime and compare it to women			0
the website polled 1,246 women across the @entity26			0
how many pairs of shoes do you go through every year ?			0
