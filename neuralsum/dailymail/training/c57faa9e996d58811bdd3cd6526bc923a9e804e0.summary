@entity0 and @entity1 are thrashing out a deal to make @entity4 's loan deal a permanent one			1
@entity5 is keen on a full - time return to his old team and the two clubs are at the negotiating table now			0
@entity0 are keen to pay around £ 6million,inclusive of add - ons , but @entity1 are understood to want closer to £ 10m for a player that cost them £ 15m just two years ago			2
winger @entity4 could cost @entity0 £ 10m to make his loan deal permanent @entity0 are interested in bringing @entity16 ( left ) back to @entity17 after impressing on loan that would mean the south @entity21 club would write off the remaining £ 4m owed to them by @entity1 after @entity5 's move to @entity24			1
@entity5 's loan is set to run until the end of the season but if the two clubs can come to an agreement over the transfer fee it could go through on monday with a new five - and - a - half - year contract			1
the 22 - year - old recently claimed he felt back at home playing back at @entity17 where he became a fans ' favourite before leaving for @entity1			2
@entity5 failed to make an impact following his £ 15m move to @entity1 in january 2013 @entity5 , tipped as one of @entity40 football 's brightest prospects at the time , was signed under former @entity1 boss sir @entity42 in january 2013			1
but he was loaned straight back to the @entity0 for the remainder of the season and did not arrive at @entity24 until the following summer , by which time @entity42 had retired and been replaced by @entity46			0
during a disastrous campaign for the club under @entity46 , @entity5 made just four @entity1 appearances before playing out the second half of last season at @entity52			0
however , @entity5 is rejuvenated back at @entity0 and manager @entity53 hopes he can keep the talented winger , especially as he does n't fall into @entity56 's @entity1 plans .			0

@entity4 signed for @entity1 in 2013 for £ 15m
however , he was *frustrated* with the lack of first - team *opportunities*
@entity5 is currently impressing back on loan at @entity17
the winger is set to sign a five - and - a - half - year deal at @entity17
