published : 20:26 est , 19 november 2013 updated : 20:26 est , 19 november 2013 some manufacturers are charging more than a 1,000 per cent markup for extra storage on tablet computers , according to a which ? investigation			1
a @entity8 , for example , costs £ 399 while a @entity9 costs £ 479 – a difference of £ 80 for @entity8 of extra storage			1
this is despite the fact the market price for @entity8 of additional memory is only £ 5.95 , the watchdog claims			1
which ? magazine compared the prices companies including @entity18 and @entity20 charge for a @entity8 tablet , compared to the same model with @entity9 of storage			1
@entity18 was found to charge £ 80 for the extra storage on its new @entity9 , pictured , even though the market price for the same amount of storage is just £ 5.95 the report comes just weeks after figures from analytics firm @entity31 found @entity18 makes £ 225 profit on every @entity9 it sells			1
the @entity34 - based firm took the tablet to pieces and worked out how much each individual component would cost to manufacture			0
it discovered the cheapest @entity39 - only @entity9 costs $ 274 to make , based on preliminary results , yet sells for $ 499			2
@entity31 ’ @entity41 only looked at the price in dollars			0
if the figures are converted to @entity46 prices this works out at £ 170 production costs compared to a retail price of £ 399			2
this works out at a markup of 129 per cent			0
@entity20 charges an extra £ 50 to increase the memory on its @entity52 from @entity8 to @entity9 , while @entity53 charges £ 40 for the same storage increase on its @entity55 8.9			1
which ? described the markups as ‘ outrageous ’ and advised potential customers to buy a tablet with an @entity60 or microsd slot and add a memory card for a fraction of the cost			0
the report said : ‘ the best thing about using a tablet is filling it with apps , songs and videos that you love			0
but all of this content gobbles up storage space fast , and tablets use flash memory that 's limited in size			1
‘ unlike with pcs , tablet storage is difficult to upgrade after you 've purchased your model			2
that 's because most tablet bodies are sealed and do n't let you install further hardware			0
’ which ? also added the true amount of storage space is not the same as advertised because operating systems and built - in apps take up space			0
it found just @entity93 of free space was left available for the customer 's songs , apps and photos on a @entity8 @entity99 3 , for example			2
@entity20 charges an extra £ 50 for a @entity9 model of its @entity52 , pictured , compared to the smaller 16gb version			1
there is also a £ 40 difference between the @entity8 and @entity9 models of its @entity107 @entity108 of @entity109 , a @entity46 - based computer manufacturer which buys its flash memory from some of the same suppliers who make the flash storage components found in tablets , told which ? : ‘ @entity8 of flash memory is mind - numbingly cheap now			1
which ? also found full storage space is rarely what 's advertised			0
for example , there is only 10gb free space on a @entity8 @entity99 3 , pictured ‘ as a general rule , for manufacturers like ourselves , flash costs less than 40p per @entity8 , so for companies to charge so much for an extra @entity8 seems scandalous			2
‘ the difference in cost between manufacturing a product with @entity8 and @entity9 of memory would probably equate to less than $ 10 ( £ 6 )			1
’ which ? editor @entity134 added : ‘ with tablets in demand this @entity136 , buyers will be shocked to discover what a raw deal they 're getting on built - in memory			0
' @entity18 and @entity20 declined to comment on the which ? report , while @entity143 told which ? : ‘ it is @entity143 policy to provide the most reasonable market price to customers			1
’ the report comes just weeks after figures from analytics firm @entity31 found @entity18 makes £ 225 profit on every @entity9 it sells			1
the @entity34 - based firm took the tablet to pieces and worked out how much each individual component would cost to manufacture			0
the cheapest @entity39 - only @entity9 costs $ 274 to make , based on preliminary results , yet sells for $ 499			0
