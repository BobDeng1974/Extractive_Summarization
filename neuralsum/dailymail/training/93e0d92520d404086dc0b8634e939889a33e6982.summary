by @entity0 texting from behind the wheel could be made impossible after @entity2 launched plans to install a device that could stop drivers from sending messages			2
the electronic giants have filed a patent for a system that could bar access to an @entity12 's messaging apps while a user is driving			1
sensors installed in phones would be able to detect the speed of the vehicle and work out where someone was sitting			2
this would allow passengers to send messages without any restrictions			0
block : the new plans by @entity2 include senors installed in a phone or the vehicle itself that would stop a driver sending a message when travelling at speed messaging at the wheel is hard to detect and has become so common that many believe a law barring it would not make a difference			1
documents filed on behalf of @entity2 in the @entity36 suggest they are looking to develop ' lockout mechanisms that disable the ability of a handheld computing device to perform certain functions , such as texting , while one is driving '			1
other plans include technology installed in the car that would block out phone signals from outside			1
in the patent , they suggest police find it hard to catch drivers who are texting because the device ' can be used out of sight '			2

a study by @entity74 , the road safety charity , suggested that texting increased the risk of crashing 23 times and slowed a drivers reaction by more than a third .			0

electronic giants would use sensors to bar messaging apps
a patent filed with @entity36 *authorities* would include ' lockout mechanisms '
plans include devices installed both in the car and the phone
