gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that affects women during pregnancy			1
up to five per cent of women giving birth in @entity109 and @entity110 has diabetes			2
most of these women have gestational diabetes , but some have type 1 or type 2 diabetes			1
in most cases , gestational diabetes develops in the third trimester - after 28 weeks - and usually disappears after the baby is born			1
diabetes is a condition where there is too much glucose ( sugar ) in the blood			0
normally , the amount of glucose in the blood is controlled by a hormone called insulin			0
but during pregnancy , some women have higher than normal levels of glucose in their blood and their body can not produce enough insulin to transport it all into the cells			0
this means that the level of glucose in the blood rises			0
gestational diabetes can be controlled with diet and exercise but some women will need medication to control blood glucose levels			1
if gestational diabetes is not detected and controlled , it can increase the risk of birth complications , such as babies being large for their gestational age known as macrosomia			1
@entity157 is a term used to describe babies when they are born weighting more than @entity161 occurs because the excess glucose in the mother ’s blood is passed to the unborn baby			1
this causes the foetus to produce the growth hormone insulin that allows glucose to enter the cells , which results in growth			0
@entity157 can lead to a condition called shoulder dystocia			0
this is when the baby ’s head passes through the vagina , but your baby ’s shoulder gets stuck in the mother 's pelvis during birth			2
this can be dangerous as a baby may not be able to breathe while they are stuck			0
it is estimated to affect 1 in 200 births			0
other complications relating to gestation diabetes include risk of premature birth , neonatal hypoglycaemia – when a newborn has low blood glucose , which can cause poor feeding , blue - tinged skin and irritability - and perinatal death , the death of the baby shortly after birth .			1
