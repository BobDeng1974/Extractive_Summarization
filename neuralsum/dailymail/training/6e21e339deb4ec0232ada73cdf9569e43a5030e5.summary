with some 130million books in existence , it 's hard to fathom how the literary sphere 's wealth of storylines could be boiled down into just six different categories			2
but a professor is now claiming that there are only half a dozen possible plots which any novel can follow			0
@entity11 , from the @entity12 , has used a high - tech computer system to analyse more than 40,000 novels in a bid to find out the pattern behind storylines			1
man in a hole : a professor has claimed that there are just six possible plots for novels - and that @entity23 ( left ) and @entity24 ( right ) fall into the ' man in a hole ' category this graphic shows how the @entity30 novel follows a broad journey in which it starts on a positive note , plunges , and then re-emerges with positivity : a concept 46 per cent of novels follow , research shows instead of focusing on the narrative , the program , called @entity38 , automatically studies the emotional journey on which novels take their readers			1
mr @entity11 found the emotional pattern used in novels can be broken down into just two categories , both of which are then divided into three sub-groups			1
he has labelled the two basic forms as ' man on a hill ' - a mainly positive story in which there is a mid-way peak - and ' man in a hole ' , which tends to follow a character as they get into trouble and crawl back out again			1
according to mr @entity11 , 46 per cent of novels are made up of ' man in the hole ' - style storylines , the most prominent of which is a @entity65 as a @entity66 by @entity30			1
@entity11 analysed 40,000 novels through a computer system and found that novels follow these two broad emotional concepts - ' man in a hole ' and ' man on a hill ' @entity23 by @entity74 was also put into the same category , while the analysis shows loves music , loves to dance , by @entity78 , follows a similar format			1
intensity by @entity81 and @entity82 in @entity83 , by @entity84 , were two examples of the ' man on a hill ' format			0
the remaining four types come from variations of those two broader categories , mr @entity11 claims			2
mr @entity11 said intensity by @entity81 is one of the ' man on a hill ' novels , as this graphic shows a @entity97 in @entity83 , by @entity84 , is another variant of the ' man on a hill ' story mr @entity11 decided to create the program after attending a lecture by @entity104 , author of @entity105			2
mr @entity104 said there was no reasons why the ' simple shape of stories ' could not be fed into computers			0
it was mr @entity104 who initially coined the phrases ' man in a hole ' and ' man on a hill '			0
experts have long been trying to analyse how novels are formed			0
meanwhile , mr @entity11 shows that simple genius by @entity119 is a version of the ' man in a hole ' story in 2004 , @entity124 published @entity125 : why we tell stories			2
he suggested there were seven types of tales : rags to riches ; overcoming the monster ; the quest ; voyage and return ; comedy ; tragedy , and rebirth			0
in the 18th century , @entity141 playwright @entity140 said there were 36 dramatic situations , which included the revolt ; the enigma ; madness ; involuntary crimes of love ; self sacrifice , and ambition .			0

@entity11 used a high - tech computer system to carry out research
program looked at emotional journey on which novels take their readers
he said there are just two categories broken down into three sub-groups
' man on a hill ' - *54* per cent of books - is a positive story with mid-way peak
but ' man in a hole ' sees characters plunge into trouble and crawl out again
