the @entity1 bar is getting a slimmer sister with 20 per cent fewer calories			1
the @entity4 , which does not have the original 's thick layer of nougat , has already been a success in the @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 and will be available here next month			1
it weighs 45g and contains 204 calories , compared with a regular @entity1 bar weighing 58g with 260 calories			1
the new limited edition @entity18 bar that will be launched by @entity1			1
it is smaller than the original , and does n't have a nougat layer the new @entity4 will see the original @entity1 bar ( pictured here ) lose its nougat layer and weigh in at 45g and 204 calories the introduction of the smaller caramel bar is expected to be followed by slimmed down versions of the traditional @entity1 and the company 's other big brands , which include @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36			1
the measures are part of a so - called @entity39 where the company has promised that all its chocolate snacks will be cut to less than 250 calories by the end of 2013			2
for some this will involve a change in the recipe by , for example , cutting the amount of fat , however in most cases it will mean smaller bars			2
the company said @entity4 has already enjoyed success in the @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 , and would tap into growing consumer preference for caramel - now one of the top three flavours in the chocolate category			1
in june , @entity1 @entity60 managing director @entity59 said reformulation might not be enough to hit the 250 calorie target and that some bars would have to shrink			1
she told the trade magazine @entity64 : ' we 're looking at the options and experimenting with a number of different sizes with customer groups			0
' chocolate maker @entity1 is planning to slim down famous brands like @entity1 , snickers and @entity33 consumers may well question the health claims given by @entity1 for cutting the size of the bars			1
historically , chocolate manufacturers have a record of shrinking their products without delivering a matching cut in price			0
as a result , customers get less for their money , while the manufacturers are able to protect their profit margins			0
the @entity60 arm of the company cut the size of the @entity1 and @entity31 bars by 7.5 per cent in 2009 , bringing them down from 62.5g to 58g			1
however , there was no cut in price			0
in 2010 the makers of the iconic @entity1 chocolate bar rejigged the recipe to contain 15 per cent less saturated fat following pressure from the @entity99 to cut fat levels			1
the healthier bars now contain less saturated palm fat than the old recipe after it was replaced by healthier sunflower oil			2
@entity1 said the change will remove more than 600 tons of saturated fat a year from the @entity60 diet - equalling seven million bags of sugar			2
snickers , @entity110 and @entity36 bars were also altered , and the company assured consumers that they would not notice any difference in the taste of the product			1
a spokesman said : ' we believe that all of our products can be enjoyed as part of a healthy lifestyle and balanced diet - our commitment to making all our chocolate products no more than 250 calories per portion reflects this			0
' these changes form part of our on - going efforts to encourage responsible consumption , and will come into effect globally by the end of next year			0
' one of @entity1 biggest rivals , @entity135 , which is now part of the @entity9 confectionary giant @entity137 , has cut the size of a number of its products in recent years			2
however , it has admitted this has been a financial decision , rather than any effort to tackle obesity			0
last year , it reduced the size of the 140g bar of @entity150 to 120g , so losing the equivalent of two chunks			2
it then cut the size of its traditional circular @entity156 tins from 975g to 850g â€“ effectively snatching away 11 of the chocolate favourites			0
at the time , the company blamed increases in the cost of commodities , such as cocoa			0
consumer groups have been sceptical about cuts in portion sizes on the pretext of supporting healthy living			0
which ? and the official customer body @entity169 argue that firms should be up - front about any decision to shrink products and to match any reductions with a cut in the price			0
@entity169 said : ' as a tactic , shrinking size but not price wo n't go down well among savvy customers who may become inclined to be less loyal to their favourite brands			0

new @entity4 will be smaller and healthier than existing @entity1 bar
it 's expected to be followed by slimmer version of the original bar
snickers , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 will also be slimmed
