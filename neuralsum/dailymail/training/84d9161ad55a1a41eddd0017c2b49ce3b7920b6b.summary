apnoea of prematurity occurs when the central nervous system is not yet mature enough to allow non-stop breathing			1

apnoea of prematurity is when automatic breathing suddenly stops			1
it tends to occur in premature babies and occurs because the baby ’s central nervous system is not fully developed when they are born			1
most babies can be roused from an apnoea episode simply by tapping or rubbing them to make them more alert , and most grow out of the condition as their body grows and develops			1
although apnoea usually resolves itself by the time most premature babies go home , a few will continue to have episodes			2
in these cases , the baby will be discharged from the intensive care with an apnoea monitor			1

nine - month - old @entity6 was born 14 weeks prematurely and developed a condition called apnoea of prematurity
it occurs when the central nervous system is not yet mature enough to breathe non-stop and can , in the most serious cases , kill a baby
doctors had to *resuscitate* @entity6 up to six times a day as a *newborn*
but doctors have confirmed he grown out of the condition and should develop normally
