as prime minister @entity3 puts it , on @entity4 we should ‘ celebrate everything it is to be @entity2 ’			2
but what does it mean to be @entity2 ? from the @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 many hundreds of years ago to those from @entity12 , the @entity14 sub-continent and the @entity15 today , @entity2 has always been shaped by migration			2
to mark @entity4 today , with a little help from @entity19 , @entity17 reveals the seemingly very @entity2 things that have actually been brought to @entity2 by people from abroad - and you may be surprised by the origins of your favourite things			2
but just as tea originates in @entity14 or @entity52 , fish and chips is partly @entity33 and partly @entity34			1
the @entity30 can take credit for uniting these two @entity55 imports and creating a coupling that is loved the world over			2
one hundred and fifty years ago , in 1860 , on the streets of the @entity61 of @entity62 , 13 - year - old @entity59 boy called @entity63 had the bright idea of combining fried fish with chips			1
@entity63 's family were rug weavers			2
to increase the family income they had begun frying chips in a downstairs room of their house			1
it was @entity63 's idea to combine the chips - at that point a novelty in @entity62 - with fish from a nearby fried fish shop			1
fried fish already had a long history in @entity62			1
in a letter written at the end of the 18th century , future @entity84 president @entity83 described eating ' fried fish in the @entity59 fashion ' on a visit to the capital			1
battered fried fish had first arrived in @entity62 200 years earlier with @entity59 refugees from @entity33 and @entity92			1
they brought with them a way of cooking fish that would eventually become as @entity30 as @entity97			1
the actual origins of polo are unclear but historians are convinced it originated in @entity102 or amongst the @entity102 tribes of @entity104 and was introduced to brits by locals in the @entity14 state of @entity108 by the 1830s , the imported novelty had established itself firmly as a favourite among @entity62 's poor			2
it was tasty , cheap and filling and could be eaten hot or cold			0
in 1846 , a @entity59 cookbook published in @entity62 included a recipe for fried fish			1
eight years later , a @entity117 for the people by @entity120 chef @entity119 contained the first printed recipe for ' fried cooked potatoes '			0
the seal of respectability came when @entity126 cook @entity125 , the forerunner of @entity128 , suggested eating fried fish with vinegar to sweeten the taste			1
no one knows exactly how and where chips first originated			1
the most popular story credits a poor @entity34 housewife from the @entity136 with their invention			1
in the winter of 1680 , the river froze			0
unable to get hold of any fish for her family , she cut potatoes into fish shapes and fried them instead			2
polo is anything more @entity2 than rubbing shoulders with the high - rollers at a polo match at the height of summer ? the actual origins of the game are unclear but historians are convinced it originated in @entity102 or amongst the @entity102 tribes of @entity104			0
the first - ever recorded polo tournament was way back in @entity159 when the @entity160 beat the @entity161 in a match			0
the game of polo spread quickly across the eastern world and became popular among @entity14 , who were introduced to the sport by the early @entity168 invaders in the 13th century			0
did you know that the tea bag was accidentally invented by a @entity172 tea merchant ? yet @entity2 plantation owners actually learned polo from locals in the @entity14 state of @entity108 in the 19th century			1
later popularised by royalty , it became the sport of wealthy englishmen			0
@entity181 we all know the @entity2 love a good cuppa			0
a lot of people know that tea was first grown in @entity52 , which was then taken to @entity14 by the @entity30			2
but did you know that the tea bag was accidentally invented by a @entity172 tea merchant ? invented by tea merchant @entity191 in @entity172 in june 1908 , they can now be found in virtually every one of @entity30 's homes			1
but if it was n't for a handful of confused @entity84 , the tea bag may never have made it into our cups at all			1
they came about only after mr @entity191 , in an attempt to cut costs , sent samples of tea leaves to potential customers in small silk pouch - like purses			2
unsure quite what to do with the strange little bag , the @entity84 dunked it into a cup of hot water			2
and so was born the tea bag			1
after complaints that the mesh on the silk was too fine , mr @entity191 developed sachets made of gauze - a method which was instrumental in today 's tea bag design			1
but it was not until 1953 , when @entity30 tea producer @entity220 spotted the commercial potential of the bag , that it began to take off here			1
the firm now sells around 200million tea bags every week			2
pubs long have the @entity30 population relished a pint in the local pub , but their creation is all thanks to the arrival of the @entity8 almost two thousand years ago			0
when they created the roman road network , they opened little inns where a passer - by could enjoy a refreshing beverage en route to their destination			0
originally called @entity242 , they began selling food and wine as well as ale			0
after the departure of the @entity8 , @entity246 began opening up all over the country			0
@entity249 himself is thought to have been born in @entity251 during the late third century between about 275 ad and 285 ad @entity249 believe it or not , even @entity249 himself is thought to have been born abroad during the late third century between about 275 ad and 285 ad			1
although historians have argued the @entity258 soldier 's place of birth for over a century , it is believed that @entity249 was born to a @entity262 @entity261 noble family in @entity251			1
@entity263 to many , the name @entity265 is synonymous with code - breaking glory by the @entity30 during @entity267			0
after all , it was there that @entity2 @entity270 and his team of mathematicians cracked the ciphers of the @entity275 ' enigma machine - a feat credited with shortening the war by two years - and one depicted in award - winning movie @entity280 starring @entity281 and @entity282			0
but in 2012 , the @entity284 @entity283 launched a campaign to highlight the important - and overlooked - role played by its nation in solving the enigma code			0
@entity284 claim that @entity284 code breakers in @entity289 were the first ones to break @entity291 ’s @entity263 by understanding the mathematics , left			0
people from @entity295 , like the @entity293 , right , are often called ' scousers ' , which is short for ‘ @entity297 ’ , which was a @entity299 stew eaten by the sailors who visited the port in 1932 , a group of cryptologists from the @entity305 - @entity306 , @entity307 and @entity302 - discovered three ways of deciphering @entity310 readings			0
seven years later , just before war broke out , the @entity284 handed over their knowledge of the @entity263 codes , as well as @entity284 - built replicas of the machines , to @entity30 and @entity120 intelligence officers near @entity289			0
@entity317 people from @entity295 are often called ‘ scousers ’			0
the name is short for ‘ @entity297 ’ , which was a @entity299 stew eaten by the sailors who visited the port			0
local families adopted the dish , and the name stuck .			0
