@entity1 ’s @entity0 has been silently removed from the tech firm 's online store it managed to hold on for seven years , but the final generation of @entity1 ’s @entity0 has been silently killed off			1
the @entity6 was the @entity1 ’s first digital music player , and although the original debuted in 2001 , there were six generations released up until 2007			1
when @entity1 ’s online store came back online yesterday , following its @entity14 event , this later model was missing from the @entity0 lineup			1
@entity1 did not make any formal announcement about ceasing the line			1
according to an earnings report earlier this year , @entity1 's @entity0 sales in the final quarter of 2013 had dropped 52 per cent year - on - year			1
@entity1 also lost 55 per cent in revenue on all models of the music player , compared to the previous year , and the @entity0 makes up less than 2 per cent of the company 's overall income			1
the drop in sales is being attributed to the increase in music apps , cloud storage and streaming services including @entity32			0
additionally , @entity33 come with @entity34 built - in , making the @entity0 redundant for most @entity14 owners			0
the trend has n't been helped by the fact @entity1 has n't released a new version of the music player since the fifth - generation @entity40 , and seventh - generation @entity41 launched in 2012			1
@entity1 did not make any formal announcement about ceasing the line			1

although that was almost double the sales of the previous three months , it equated to a 52 % drop in sales year - on - year			0
the drop is being attributed to the increase in music apps , cloud storage and streaming services sales of @entity49 were at their highest during 2008 following the launch of the first @entity40 at the end of 2007			2
the @entity40 was designed to look like an @entity14 , played music and ran apps , but could not make calls			0
similar sales were seen across 2009 thanks to the launch of the third - generation shuffle , fourth - generation nano and second - generation touch			0
since january this year , reports claim @entity1 has sold around 12 million units , which is less than half of 2013 sales figures			2
the highest capacity @entity0 now available is the @entity78 version of the @entity40 , which costs £ 249 in the @entity79 and $ 299 in the @entity80			0
customers may still be able to get their hands on an @entity0 through third - party retailers , until stock runs out			0
