it 's never too late to get fit says @entity2 's oldest female @entity1 , who is still competitively swimming , cycling and running at the age of 71			1
grandmother @entity5 , who lives in @entity7 , @entity8 , has taken part in four @entity11 events and is currently planning to do another in @entity13 next year			1
the @entity15 - born retired social worker only started running when she turned 50 and has since completed physical challenges that people half her age would struggle to manage			1
she said : ' it 's never too late to get into physical activity			1
you can swim whatever your age			2
strength training you can do at home and build up quickly			0
' it can make such a difference as you age - you will be less likely to have a fall and you can be more independent and need less support			0
' she added : ' it 's good for both physical and mental health			1
i 'm often told i do n't look 71 or people tell me : " i wish my mum and dad did that "			0
i 'm toned and in good general health			2
' @entity5 was advised by her doctor to start exercising in her fifties when she started to go through the menopause			1
women in this phase of life are more at risk of osteoporosis due to the hormonal changes in their bodies making their bones weaker			0
physical activity - in particularly weight training - is one of the best ways for women to increase their bone density and keep their bodies strong			0
@entity5 took up running and strength training for this reason and entered the @entity67 to keep her motivated			1
swim , bike , run : an @entity11 involves a 2.4 mile swim , 112 mile bike ride and 26.2 mile run - and @entity5 does it all with a smile on her face she joked she also had another incentive : ' my husband said i would never be able to run a half marathon so i had to prove him wrong ! ' after that she went on to run the @entity83 four times , achieving an impressive time of three hours and 56 minutes			1
however , her running training was then curtailed after she sustained a knee injury when skiing			0
' i knew i could n't keep pounding the pavements so i took up triathlon , ' she explained			0
she was inspired by her sons , who had entered a triathlon , and they took part in the event together			0
' it 's great to do something like that with my family , even if they beat me ! ' she said			0
she hopes her example shows her three children and four grandchildren that it is possible to stay in shape as you age			0
' my grandchildren call me @entity106 , ' she joked , ' but i hope i am inspiring to them by showing them that you can keep exercising as you get older			0
' after successfully completing a number of triathlons and duathlons , @entity5 then took on her biggest challenge of all - the @entity11 - for the first time at the age of 66			1
the event involves a 2.4 mile swim , followed by a 112 mile bike ride , rounded off with a marathon run ( 26.2 miles )			1
ambassador for a good cause : @entity5 has been asked to front a campaign for @entity121 many who line up to take part in the events each year fail to finish			1
but @entity5 made it round in under 16 hours and qualified in her age group for a coveted place in the @entity129 - held in @entity130 every year			1
she 's now planning to do the @entity11 again in 2015			1
due to her knee problems , she keeps her running to a minimum - averaging around 12 miles a week - swims occasionally and cycles regularly doing long rides , spinning classes and getting on her bike to travel around @entity8			2
she also does regular strength training exercises such as balancing on one leg			0
as well improving her health and fitness , training for the event has enhanced her social life			1
@entity5 , pictured behind the scenes of the charity photo shoot , is often told she looks younger than her years she trains with @entity8 - based @entity148 , where she has made many friends			1
' running clubs are accommodating of all abilities and ages			0
you do n't need to be good to join and you get fit as well as enjoying the social side			2
i have made many friends of all ages at my running club			0
you have that common interest , ' she said			0
taking part in races has also given her the opportunity to raise money for charity			2
as she has been such a staunch supporter of good causes through her career and sporting achievements , she has now been named a ' @entity170 ' as part of @entity172			2
thanks to her sporting achievements , @entity5 has been named a ' @entity175 the week , which began on monday and runs until 14th september , aims to inspire the nation to think about leaving a charitable gift in their will			1
@entity5 said : ' it was a privilege to be asked to help promote remember a @entity182 and i enjoyed filming a video for the campaign in my local park			2
' taking on a challenge , however small , is a good way to raise money for charity but people can also leave money to charities in their @entity194			0
