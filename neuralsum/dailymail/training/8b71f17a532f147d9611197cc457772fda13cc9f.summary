one of @entity1 ’s most famous athletes was last night drawn into an investigation after it was claimed that the sport ’s governing body failed to act upon ‘ suspicious ’ drugs test samples			1
@entity7 , a former chairman of the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) , told @entity9 he had been asked to lead an inquiry into allegations that hundreds of abnormal readings could indicate doping was covered up			1
in a scandal now engulfing the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) , 225 athletes from 39 countries were revealed to have produced anomalous blood readings			1
they include three @entity1 athletes – one of whom is a household name and a star of track and field events			2
@entity7 , a former chairman of the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) , said he had been asked to lead an inquiry into allegations that hundreds of abnormal readings could indicate doping was covered up the star ’s name appears on a leaked list of 65 athletes whose tests scores were labelled ‘ @entity33 ’ – which experts say should have triggered an automatic check for the banned drug @entity36			1
the drug helps deliver oxygen to muscles by stimulating the production of red blood cells			1
but amid mounting concerns that the @entity17 did not conduct follow - up tests on most or all of the sportsmen and women , mr @entity7 – one of the sport ’s most senior figures – has been approached to establish what happened to the results			1
he said : ‘ what i understood … was that a great number of cases came back and were short of something that could be declared positive , but whoever had done the analysis clearly thought that there was something afoot			0
’ the @entity1 star has so far declined to comment , yet the scandal has already claimed several high - ranking executives and shows little sign of abating			0
the ‘ @entity33 ’ list is among a cache of documents sourced by @entity9 and said to have come from a whistleblower at the @entity17 ’s @entity69			0
although undated , the list is said to have been compiled between 2006 and 2008 before the introduction into athletics of much stricter tests for banned substances			2
under suspicion : @entity1 athletes are on the list it has been argued that it is unlikely any readings taken during this period could be used to investigate athletes retrospectively , but mr @entity7 said it may be possible to uncover past violations of cheating if these readings are used in conjunction with frozen samples			1
while being named on the list does not provide conclusive evidence that the @entity1 star was taking banned substances , experts have said it raises serious questions about whether proper checks were made			2
elsewhere in the documents are more detailed lists which do not mention the @entity1 athlete , but do suggest that @entity98 and @entity99 champions showed abnormal blood values that strongly suggest the use of performance - enhancing drugs			1
these more detailed documents relate to tests taken between 2001 and 2006			0
the two other @entity1 named are less high - profile , and the level of suspicion is lower and coded ‘ orange			0
’ the @entity17 does not dispute the authenticity of the information , which was first obtained by the @entity111 television station @entity110 and broadcast in a documentary last month			0
but it says it may not prove the stars had been cheating and suggested other factors might have produced high test results			2
however , last night the former head of @entity118 ’s anti-doping commission described the @entity17 ’s response to the scandal as ‘ completely unsatisfactory ’ and suggested there was more to the list ‘ than we are being told ’			0
@entity125 @entity124 , a respected campaigner for transparency in sport , added that the existence of the ‘ red ’ list ‘ raises serious concerns about what happened next ’			0
she said : ‘ that is the real issue here			0
being on such a list in the first place is in itself indicative that something irregular has been flagged up			0
‘ did the @entity17 target test the people on this list , as i would expect should have been the case , or not ? and if not , why not ? ‘ i think there is more to this list than we have been told and the @entity17 ’s response so far is completely unsatisfactory			2
what did they find when they did further investigation ? did they in fact do anything ? ‘ with everything going on and so much uncertainty , it is simply unsatisfactory to say there is no problem and expect people to accept that blindly			0
’ many of the names listed in the documents are accompanied by detailed readings of their blood values , with figures appearing under various headings			1
for instance , one is ‘ hgb ’ – haemoglobin , which transports oxygen in the blood			1
the documents also record the altitude level – which can affect red blood cell count – at which the tests took place			2
together , the results produce an overall figure known as the ‘ off score ’ level and anything over 125 is considered to be a marker of potential doping			2
the documents show that the highest ‘ off score ’ level for a male athlete was 167.63 – considered to be extraordinarily high – yet there is no record that he was charged with a doping offence			2
the highest ‘ off score ’ level for a female athlete is 170.03 and again there is no public record of the athlete being charged			0
more than a quarter of the athletes named in documents are @entity197 , lending credence to claims that @entity200 operated an ‘ @entity111 - style ’ doping regime			1
there is also a high number of @entity204 on the lists			0
the @entity1 star has so far declined to comment , yet the scandal has already claimed several high - ranking executives and shows little sign of abating the @entity17 has claimed that it did follow up ‘ suspicious ’ readings of blood levels and exonerated many of the names			1
it emphasised the appearance of a name on a list marking suspicion did not indicate that a doping offence had taken place			0
@entity17 general secretary @entity218 has insisted that the mere presence of a suspicious value does not indicate a positive test , and that the information provided by the documents ‘ was partial and misleading			0
’ he has also said in a statement that : ‘ athletes with a “ red flag ” reading may well be guilty of doping but equally – and we can prove it in the vast majority of cases – they may be innocent , which is why this information should have stayed locked up in a safe			1
’ last night , he told @entity9 in an email : ‘ we welcome the intervention of @entity8			1
in all our statements we have underlined that we will co-operate totally with @entity8			1
’ asked whether he believed the @entity17 had followed up suspicious blood readings , he replied : ‘ yes – but let @entity8 do their work now			1
’ mr @entity7 said @entity8 's inquiry has ' resulted from pretty extensive publication of materials that look pretty serious ' mr @entity7 will establish the terms of reference for the @entity8 inquiry before deciding whether to accept the invitation to lead it			1
he said : ‘ @entity8 has a general monitoring responsibility with respect to international standards and with respect to the anti-doping code			1
‘ we are meant to do that and it ’s part of our mandate			0
and this is a specific inquiry that has resulted from pretty extensive publication of materials that look pretty serious			0
‘ i think our stakeholders , the @entity258 , the international federations and the public authorities , would expect us to do something and our chairman has responded by saying yes indeed we agree and will set up a commission and give it the neces - sary resources to do whatever has to be done			0
’ there is already a separate @entity17 ethics commission inquiry into the doping lists			2
last week three key @entity17 figures – treasurer @entity273 , marketing consultant @entity274 , and legal adviser @entity276 – agreed to stand down while allegations against them were investigated by the ethics committee .			0
