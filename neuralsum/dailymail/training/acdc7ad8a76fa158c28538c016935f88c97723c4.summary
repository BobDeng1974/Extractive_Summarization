by @entity0 published : 23:32 est , 15 june 2013 updated : 00:36 est , 16 june 2013 @entity1 was 21 when he sentenced to 40 years in prison for a murder his friend @entity4 had implicated him in , despite @entity4 not remembering any details of the night in question			1
the only evidence that linked @entity1 to the murder of a sports editor , found strangled in his office car park in @entity11 , @entity12 , was testimony from two witnesses who have since recanted their statements under oath			1
but despite the appeals and extensive campaigns spearheaded by @entity1 's father , @entity21 , and documentary on @entity24 's @entity23 , the young man remains in prison for a crime he vehemently denies being involved in			1
appeal : @entity1 has always denied that he was involved in the murder of @entity29 two years after @entity30 sports editor @entity29 was discovered strangled to death by his own belt in the early hours of november 1 , 2001 , @entity4 told police he believed he was involved			1
he told police the pair , who had been 17 at the time , had been drinking underage at a nearby bar and that he could not remember what happened on the night in question			2
after reading a newspaper article about the murder he became convinced he was involved , saying that a photo fit of a man seen near the scene looked like him			2
in his police interviews @entity4 , who was a drug user , was unable to give details of the crime , wrongly stating that @entity29 had been strangled by a shirt , or a bungee cord , before the detective questioning him tells @entity4 it was a belt			2
he claimed however , that he struck the editor once , before @entity1 strangled him			1
' the police threatened me to implicate @entity1 or else i would be solely responsible for @entity29 â€™s death and be charged with first - degree murder and possibly sentenced to death , ' @entity55 said in an affidavit			1
confess : a mug shot of @entity4 , right , who said he was involved after seeing a photofit , right , in a paper memory loss : @entity4 , who says he can not remember the night of the murder , recently retracted his statement that @entity1 was involved despite fingerprints , a bloody footprint and other evidence found at the scene not matching @entity4 or @entity1 , police arrested the young men			1
' everything is wrong about this case , everything 's wrong about it			2
it makes absolutely no sense , ' @entity78 , who is working of @entity1 's appeal , told the court			1
@entity1 has denied being involved in the case , throughout his arrest , trial and seven appeals			1
he stated to police that on the night @entity29 was killed , he and @entity4 had gone to a bar and then he drove them home			0
when his latest appeal was denied , @entity1 told @entity24 : ' i just sat in this room by myself			1
and just stared at the floor ... and it 's frustrating because you do n't know , even with all the facts , if you 'll ever get your life back			0
' the appeal last year centered around the two witnesses who had implicated @entity1 both admitting they lied			1
tribute : @entity100 was the sports editor at the @entity30 and a father of two crime scene : the sports editor was leaving his office after 2am when he was strangled in the car park @entity4 , who is serving a 25 - year - sentence , is now saying that although he still has no memory of the night in question , he believes he acted alone			1
tribune janitor @entity109 , who said he saw the young men at the scene , also later admitted under oath that he had falsely identified them from a picture he was shown			2
in his police interview , @entity4 said : ' i could just be fabricating it all and not know			0
this is after reading the newspaper article in october and this is kinda what i put together with what could 've happened			2
' he went on to say : ' from there on i 'm just presuming what happened			0
i 'm making presumptions based on what i read in the newspaper			0
' according to the @entity30 , a key witness who was the last person to see the victim alive , was never thoroughly investigated			0
fellow sportswriter @entity130 had left the office the same time as @entity29 , who was married with two children			0
he says that he drove off before @entity29			0
the 1991 blue @entity133 he was driving that night was never searched , and he traded it shortly afterwards			0
police have never been able to trace it			0
a forensic pathologist , dr @entity136 , has examined evidence from the trial for ms @entity78 , @entity24 said			2
he claims that the tire tool @entity4 said he used to beat his victim did not fit the injuries			0
he added that the struggle lasted between six to eight minutes , meaning mr @entity130 put himself at the scene very close to the time the crime was reported			1
according to @entity24 mr @entity130 said he left the car park at about 2.20am , only six minutes before 911 was called			0
campaign : @entity1 , left , with his father @entity21 and sister , @entity149 , who are trying to have him released mr @entity130 , who has always cooperated with investigators and denied having anything to do with the crime , told 48 hours that he returned to the car park later that night after hearing about the murder			1
@entity1 's family and lawyer continue to fight for the young man 's conviction to be overturned			2
' i 've always felt that the system works , ' ms @entity78 said , as she explained her determination to have him freed			0
' he is absolutely innocent			0
... i do n't want to be part of a system that can not recognize and correct an error			0

@entity1 has always *maintained* his innocence
no evidence links the two friends to scene of killing in @entity12
only witnesses retracted statements that put @entity1 at the scene
despite seven appeals and no evidence , *27* - year - old is still in jail
