by @entity0 published : 08:49 est , 24 january 2014 updated : 09:27 est , 24 january 2014 tragedy : @entity3 died within 24 hours of returning home from hospital after doctors said his poor health was ' wind ' , an inquest heard a bereft mother has been forced to relive the harrowing moment she tried to revive her dying newborn baby hours after medics sent him home saying he had wind , an inquest heard today @entity17 , 35 , claims she told hospital staff three - day - old son @entity19 was grey , grizzly and not feeding properly but a @entity22 maternity unit believed he was fine and discharged them			1
just a few hours later @entity17 was watching tv with @entity3 's father @entity25 when the infant made a noise in his @entity29 basket as if he had taken his last breath , she said			1
she desperately gave her son mouth - to - mouth and he was rushed into a different hospital but was pronounced dead shortly afterwards			1
today miss @entity17 spoke out at her son 's inquest where she and her partner claimed doctors at @entity40 should not have allowed @entity3 to go home			1
but a coroner has ruled that doctors were right to send a newborn baby home , even though the child died just eight hours later			1
' he was grey in colour he just looked poorly			2
he would only settle if he was upright , he seemed uncomfortable			2
we had to keep him upright all the time , ' she told the hearing ' when he was born on the thursday he was a lovely pink , big chunky baby			1
on the saturday he was a totally different baby			1
' he had been grizzly all night			2
he looked a totally different baby			1
everyone commented that it was not the same baby			2
i had a photo of him taken that morning , he was not looking a healthy pink colour he looked grey			2
' everyone thought i was putting pictures of him up after he had died , i said no that was before			2
' tender : @entity3 's father @entity67 kisses his son in the minutes after his birth but he later turned grey and grizzly , his parents said bereft : @entity17 , pictured while pregnant with @entity3 , said within 24 hours of returning home her son was distressed and struggling to breathe moving : @entity3 's mother said ' all of a sudden i heard him make a noise ' , which she told the hearing sounded like his last breath the hearing was told @entity3 had been born on february 14 last year weighing 7lb 7oz and at 39 weeks after @entity80 underwent a caesarean section , as she had done when giving birth to her two previous children			1
miss @entity17 was told by midwife that upon his birth @entity3 looked healthy but he had a low set of ears and a small chin and a fat pad on the back of his neck			1
the secretary from @entity40 said : ' i was a bit shocked because i have read up on all sorts of things when pregnant and i had never heard of a low set of ears			0
i asked if it was a problem and she said that he would need to be referred to paediatrician			0
it was only briefly mentioned , when the paediatrician came round to do the checks i mentioned it and he said ' no it 's fine - no concerns '			2
' ' @entity3 was feeding fine for the first 24 hours			1
he was brilliant , he took it every two hours , he was perfect			0
but he gradually stopped over the next 12 hours			0
he did n't want to know , by friday evening he was n't feeding , he was constantly crying			0
he was very , very unsettled he was n't feeding at all			0
' blame : the parents say staff at @entity40 should not have discharged the baby when he was struggling to feed the inquest was told @entity17 told a midwife her son was n't feeding but added : ' she said that the baby of this size was a bit hit and miss with breastfeeding and to carry on persevering because he had fed. ' i was getting stressed			1
i thought he must be hungry			0
they said it was quite normal not to feed they did n't seem concerned			0
i wanted to breastfeed , this was the first baby who actually took to it			2
' family : @entity67 with @entity3 in hospital where he was born via c section and there were no concerns or any difficulties within the pregnancy she added that the nurses put it down to the baby being ' windy			1
' @entity80 said : ' how can i have a windy baby if he has not eaten ? i do n't remember him passing urine			2
i told the nursing staff he was was n't weeing			2
' i monitored his nappies , on the 15th i kept three nappies at the bottom of the bed			0
i asked the midwife to check them , they were bone dry but she said they felt alright and threw them in the bin			2
all they kept saying , he had wind			0
that 's what they put it down to			0
' the hearing was told hospital notes claimed @entity3 was passing urine and ' gulping milk			1
' further notes taken later recorded noth mother and baby were sleeping following breast feeding and at 3.40am that @entity3 had been unsettled for a few hours			1
the inquest heard hospital notes recorded the baby being ' a good colour , clear eyes and skin '			1
@entity17 was discharged from hospital at 4pm on february 16 and family visited later that evening			1
but she said : ' nothing settled him			0
i sent @entity67 to go and get some milk			0
he was n't feeding , he was still crying lots			0
we got him a bottle			0
he did n't take the bottle , he was n't opening his mouth , he was pushing away			2
he was a really funny colour			0
' the couple decided to bath him to try and settle him			0
miss @entity17 said : ' he seemed to cry less but obviously he was on a downward spiral			1
it was n't a cry , it was more of a dull cry , he was whimpering			0
i thought ' we have cracked it , it seems to be calming down '			0
we decided to stay downstairs with him that night			0
' she added that he was placed in a @entity29 basket and they watched him and @entity67 watched a film in the early hours of february 17			0
miss @entity17 said : ' i could hear him making a noise , all of a sudden i heard him make a noise ( demonstrated like a last gasp of breath )			1
i said to @entity67 to ring the ambulance he has stopped breathing			0
i was trying to blow into his mouth trying to give him air			1
i knew from picking him up he had just gone limp			1
' innocent : @entity17 and @entity3 were discharged from hospital on february 16 last year but the next day he fell ill and an ambulance was called he was taken to @entity204 where he died at 3.01am after attempts to resuscitate him			1
@entity207 dr @entity206 claimed in a medical examination @entity3 appeared healthy			1
dr @entity206 said : ' i found him to be a well looking baby , he had been reported to be breastfeeing well , he was pink			2
' he did have a heart murmur but normal heart sounds , no breathing difficulties , liver not enlarged			0
he did not look to have any unusual features			0
. ' he did n't strike me as unusual in any way			0
he cried when he was disturbed but did settle once given something to suck			0
he behaved as a newborn baby would do '			1
midwife @entity219 said : ' nobody raised any concerns to me about the baby 's colour			1
after 24 hours they can become paler , it 's not uncommon , the only difference i saw was the large fat pad on the back of the neck , other than that he seemed healthy to me and i had no other concerns			0
' i have no recollection of @entity17 raising concerns about her or her baby			1
we would advise to save the nappies if parents have got concerns i do n't recall seeing them			0
' returning a death by natural causes @entity241 coroner @entity240 : ' indeed the loss of a child is always a terrible thing whatever the age of the child , but in four - days of life , our hearts go out to you			1
' what then occurred after the first 24 hours with @entity3 , as in mum 's evidence was he did well with feeding and sleeping but then concerns were expressed of lack of wee , feeding and sleeping			1
it is very noticeable that none of the health care specialists thought these concerns were worthy of note or delay in discharge			2
' i did n't find that it was unreasonable to discharge @entity17 and @entity3			1
no one suggested there should 've been any delay after checks on him			0
the conclusion i have to return is one of natural causes , all we can say is that it was an unknown medical cause , the medical cause of death was not fully established			0
' speaking after the inquest @entity3 's dad , @entity25 27 , said : ' if i have another child there is no way i 'm going to believe the things they say but i 'm sure they wo n't have this happening again			1
i hold the staff accountable for this , it is a total disgrace			0
' the inquest continues .			2
