around 1.3million families face losing their homes after taking out mortgages which they have little or no hope of repaying , a major report reveals today			1
many householders on ‘ interest - only ’ deals have failed to make provision for paying back the capital , the @entity6 concludes			1
when their mortgages expire , they could be forced to sell their family homes or borrow money from friends or family to make up the shortfall			1
others face extending their mortgages well into their 70s			1
homeowners with an interest - only mortgage could be forced to sell their property or borrow money to pay back the capital asked how they planned to repay the capital , some admitted their only hope was that they will have died before their bank asks for its money back			1
the @entity6 believes the mortgage timebomb will hit 40,000 people a year between 2017 and 2032 , many of whom will be over the age of 65 when their loan matures			1
it said its report was a ‘ wake - up call ’ for the 2.6million householders with interest - only mortgages , which allow them to pay off only the interest			1
at the end of the term , they are supposed to have amassed enough in savings or equity to pay off the capital			0
however , the @entity6 found that the average amount owed on interest - only loans is £ 72,000 , with many owing more than double that			1
the @entity6 report warns that a shocking 48 per cent of such borrowers either have no way of repaying the loan , or will fall woefully short of the amount they need			1
around 260,000 have no strategy at all for repaying the debt			0
many said they planned to ‘ downsize ’ to a smaller home , while others were pinning their hopes on inheriting a lump sum from a relative			0
heartbreak : @entity63 and @entity64 have an interest - only mortgage and are worried they will be forced to sell their home in @entity69 @entity63 and @entity64 have no idea how they will pay off their £ 119,000 mortgage in 2028			1
mr @entity73 took out the interest - only loan on a three - bedroom semi-detached home in @entity69 in 2005			0
he was attracted by the £ 466 - a - month payments with a 4.7 per cent interest rate			0
the couple planned to switch to a repayment loan but mr @entity73 was made redundant last year			1
the couple now play in a @entity83 - style wedding band called the @entity84 , with 50 - year - old mrs @entity64 on the double - bass			2
a repayment mortgage would raise their monthly payments to £ 675 , which they could no longer afford			2
their house is now worth £ 150,000 and they are considering selling it before the capital is due			0
mr @entity73 said : ‘ i keep saying to @entity64 that when we need to retire we are going to be forced to sell up if we have n’t paid off the mortgage by then			2
that would be heart - breaking because i love everything about this place			0
in a worst - case scenario , we can take the equity and rent			0
‘ what would really scare me is if our bank tried to push us back on to a repayment loan tomorrow because there is absolutely no way we could afford it			0
’ in addition , many borrowers are already in dire financial straits , with one in ten having ‘ in excess of £ 25,000 of unsecured borrowing ’ , including credit card bills , overdrafts and payday loans			0
the report said 65,000 householders believe they were mis - sold the mortgages and claim they had no idea they would be expected to repay the original loan			2
over the next 12 months , homeowners whose loans are due to mature within the next seven years are to be sent a formal letter to warn them about the problem			0
interest - only mortgages were sold by many banks and building societies until 2009 , with some people allowed to borrow more than seven times their salary			1
interest - only mortgages have almost disappeared from the mortgage market , with lenders such as @entity135 refusing to sell them to new customers the @entity6 made it clear that borrowers – not their banks – must take responsibility for the loans that they took out			1
@entity142 , chief executive , said : ‘ my advice to borrowers is to not bury your head in the sand			0
’ the @entity149 echoed the @entity6 , saying : ‘ the responsibility for repaying the mortgage lies with the customer			1
’ @entity154 , executive director of consumer watchdog which ? , said : ‘ lenders should recognise their responsibility , communicate clearly with their customers and explain all the options available to help them			0
it is essential that customers trapped on their current mortgage are treated fairly , and lenders must show forbearance to people who are struggling			1
’ @entity166 , chief executive of mortgage broker @entity167 , said interest - only mortgages had helped many people to buy their first home , but added : ‘ it is not suitable for everyone			1
in retrospect , perhaps at the height of the market , interest - only mortgages were dished out rather too freely			2
’ interest - only mortgages have almost disappeared from the mortgage market , with lenders such as @entity135 and the co-op refusing to sell them to new customers			1
by @entity178 , of @entity179 's @entity177 the report suggests bright young things are trapped by big mortgages , says @entity178 the interest - only timebomb ticking away for borrowers has been laid bare again			1
we have long warned about this issue and have even built our own wake - up alarm calculator ( below ) to help people understand it			2
it 's important to note that not all interest - only mortgages are bad			2
used sensibly they can be an efficient and flexible way to borrow			2
but the new @entity6 report identifies in its great detail a band of borrowers we have warned about – dubbed the @entity198			1
these are young professionals with good career prospects who borrowed big to get on the property ladder in the late boom years			0
there is a disproportionate number of them in @entity207 and the @entity208 , where house prices are highest - many of them also carry large amounts of personal unsecured debt on credit cards and loans			0
a shift to a repayment loan would mean severe cutbacks to their spending - and hamper their chance of saving , especially for retirement			0
as someone in my mid- 30s , i know plenty of them - they are my peers in good jobs who can not really afford their sizeable mortgages			2
they bought properties before the 2007 peak and were encouraged by lenders and brokers to go for broke			0
in fact , when my wife and i bought our first flat in 2006 we were openly invited to borrow more and buy a more expensive home by going interest - only			2
we turned that offer down , but many did n't			0
the @entity6 report quite rightly identifies that this chunk of borrowers have the time and the earnings potential to switch to a repayment mortgage and get the debt cleared			1
the only problem is that while that may be true over the next two decades or so , it does n't mean they can afford to stump up the extra £ 500 a month they may need to switch to a repayment loan now			0
and with lenders having called time on interest - only loans that means they ca n't move or remortgage , putting their own crunch moment a lot closer than they think			0
this calculator shows borrowers with no plan to repay an interest - only loan , or whose investments have fallen short , how much extra you may have to find if your lender forced you on to a repayment mortgage			2
enter the amount still owed on your mortgage to find out how much a move to a repayment mortgage could cost you .			0

may have to borrow money from family or friends to make up shortfall
others face extending their mortgages well into their 70s
