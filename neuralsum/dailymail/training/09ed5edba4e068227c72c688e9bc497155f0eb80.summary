@entity2 's fourth taxpayer funded attempt to have his security downgraded was described as ' absurd ' by a judge a judge has dismissed a cop killer ’s attempt to move to a cushier prison cell as an ‘ absurd ’ waste of public money			1
@entity2 , 48 , who shot pc @entity11 in cold blood , demanded to have his security category downgraded despite being one of @entity17 ’s ‘ most dangerous ’ inmates			1
at the @entity19 today , mr @entity18 dismissed his claim as ‘ completely untenable ’ and designed to make his life in prison a ‘ little more comfortable ’			1
it is the fourth time the ‘ bestial ’ former @entity25 marine has used legal aid to sue the prison service for breaching his human rights and his claims have cost the taxpayer tens of thousands of pounds			1
last night , @entity33 ’s widow said it was ‘ disgusting ’ that her husband ’s murderer was able to sue the prison service and branded him a ‘ drain on society ’			0
speaking from her home in @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 said : ‘ i ’m very glad the judge threw the case out as i think he ’s a drain on society			0
it ’s not right that a convicted murderer can get legal aid to fund this			1
‘ it ’s a blight on my husband ’s memory that he has chosen to do this			0
it ’s been more than ten years since my husband was murdered and he is preventing me from moving on with my life			0
’ @entity2 shot the injured traffic policeman at point blank range as he begged for his life outside a betting shop in @entity60 on @entity61 2003			1
describing his crimes as ‘ bestial ’ yesterday , mr @entity18 criticised his use of legal aid			1
‘ since his incarceration , @entity2 has occupied himself by making numerous applications to the @entity19 about the conditions in which he is being held , ’ he said			2
‘ all of the claims he has made have been funded by legal aid , ’ said the judge , who normally sits in the family courts			1
‘ it is perhaps noteworthy that i have sat in this court , where i usually sit , with litigants in person before me - people who are desperate to see their children - from whom the government has withdrawn all legal aid			1
’ @entity2 entered the @entity17 in 1996 using the stolen identity documents of a dead child while on the run from the authorities in his native @entity25			1
police approached him on @entity61 , 2003 , after spotting that his false numberplates and he opened fire as they tried to arrest him			2
traffic officer @entity89 was shot in the back and fell to the ground			0
he ‘ pleaded for his life ’ as @entity2 approached , but the cold - blooded killer shot him in the head			1

however , his minimum term was later reduced to 37 years			0
@entity11 , pictured on his 2001 wedding day with wife @entity41 - who has described her husband 's killer 's attempt to move prisons as ' disgusting ' the murderer has been held in maximum security conditions ever since but has used legal aid to launch a series of legal challenges to improve his life behind bars			1
‘ this truly was a bestial crime , ’ mr @entity18 said , describing the remarks of the judge who jailed @entity2 as ‘ sobering reading ’			1
@entity117 , for @entity2 , argued that the killer ’s right to a fair hearing had been violated			2
justice @entity18 described @entity2 's case as ' untenable ' and ' absurd ' but , dismissing his challenge , the judge said : ‘ the offence here was at the upper end of bestial			1
for someone to have committed such a grievous crime he must have no control over when he has normal human contact			0
‘ it is therefore perfectly reasonable to suppose that somebody who has committed a crime as grave as this , and who has accepted in no respect at all the reason for his incarceration , would make every effort to escape from prison at the first opportunity			0
‘ the murder offence here must loom large in any judgment as to whether @entity2 is a high escape risk			2
’ he concluded : ‘ the arguments that have been put forward in this case are completely untenable			2
indeed , i would characterise them as absurd			0
’ @entity2 ’s earliest possible release date is set for 2041 and he would almost certainly be extradited to the @entity25 if he is ever freed from prison			2
he is considered to be ‘ one of the most dangerous people currently in the prison system ’			0
but he claims his status as a category - a exceptional - risk prisoner , which restricts his movements within @entity161 ’s high - security @entity159 , breaches his human rights			0
his security categorisation means he has to move cell every 28 days and change wing every three months , alongside other tight restrictions			0
earlier this year found to be unfit for a security downgrade due to the ‘ nature of his offending ’ , fears that he had ‘ access to finances , resources and / or associates that could assist with an escape attempt ’ and due to his very long sentence			0
he has attempted two prison breaks .			0
