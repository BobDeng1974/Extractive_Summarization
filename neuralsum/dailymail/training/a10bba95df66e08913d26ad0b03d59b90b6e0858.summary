by @entity0 published : 10:38 est , 17 october 2012 updated : 11:24 est , 17 october 2012 they were ordinary people doing an extraordinary job – a 20 - strong battalion individually serving queen and country			1
against a backdrop of statues depicting some of the most celebrated figures in @entity11 military history , their names were hardly familiar			1
but yesterday in @entity17 , in the shadow of @entity14 , @entity15 and others , 20 new statues temporarily went on parade in support of @entity20			1
in the shadow of @entity14 : @entity20 has unveiled 20 sculptures of injured servicemen in @entity17 roadshow : each sculpture will travel to the local community of the serviceman it depicts the two - dimensional , life - size figures were unveiled in tribute to those wounded in service , some in the bloody conflicts of @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 or @entity35			1
cast and sculpted in clear acrylic , they were designed to represent not only those they depict – but to maintain public awareness that lives and limbs are still being lost			1
and that thousands are still having to rebuild shattered careers after sometimes devastating injuries			2
soon the statues will embark on separate tours of @entity11 , visiting the victims ’ local communities , military establishments , schools and museums			1
the idea is to raise awareness of the sacrifices @entity11 ’s servicemen and women make			2
or , as sniper victim @entity61 put it yesterday : ‘ it ’s just another way of saying : “ look , we ’re normal guys , people from your town ”			1
’ awareness : each of the 20 figures depicts a soldier wounded in battle in @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 or @entity35 ' it 's a way of saying ' look , we 're normal guys " : @entity73 mechanic @entity61 , 33 , lost most of his sight when he was shot in the face in @entity33 in 2006 @entity73 ( @entity73 ) mechanic @entity61 , 33 , from @entity77 , was shot in the face during his second tour of @entity33 in 2006			1
he was hit while rescuing six colleagues under fire in what he described as ‘ a turkey shoot ’ after their vehicle broke down and stranded them			2
the rifle bullet went through his left cheekbone and out the other side of his face			2
he survived by shoving his thumb up to the palette of his mouth to stop himself choking to death on his blood , then stemming the bleeding while keeping his jawbone together			2
his mates survived because he hitched his truck to their vehicle and towed them to safety			2
the bullet destroyed @entity61 's left eye and permanently damaged his right , leaving him with only 19 per cent vision			0
standing beside his statue yesterday he told me : ' take a look at the guys with missing limbs , who still have smiles on their faces , and you realise your life is n’t that bad			0
if you can let people know they ’re appreciated , and give them a lift , it ’s pretty special to them			0
' poignant : @entity118 amongst the statues ' it 's a way of underlining what an extreme war @entity32 is ' : @entity123 , left , and @entity124 , right , stand by their cut - outs hope : @entity127 walks between the likenesses of battle casualties proud : @entity130 and @entity131 brave the elements former @entity133 , 26 , was shot in the ankle five years ago while serving in @entity32			0
he and two colleagues on a rooftop came under heavy fire from inside a @entity139 compound			0
his quick - thinking almost certainly saved their lives			0
' they were badly wounded and covered in blood ' , he said , ' i did n’t realise i 'd been shot at the time so i helped them			1
i say helped – i just pushed them off the roof into cover			0
they probably did n’t think i was helping at the time			0
' the statue of @entity123 , an ex-lance corporal , is likely to be going at some stage to his former barracks at @entity155 in @entity156			0
' with the amount of injuries and the amount of lads who wo n’t be returning , it ’s a way of underlining what an extreme war @entity32 is ' , he said			0
the @entity20 initiative is being sponsored by @entity165 's , which began its association with the armed forces by sending @entity169 to troops in the @entity171			1
it hopes to raise £ 1m for the charity through public donations linked to the statues , created by sculptor @entity176			0
@entity20 co-founder @entity177 stood alongside the statues and their subjects yesterday and said : ' a lot of these people have left the services but their battle injuries are going to be with them for life			1
there ’s a real danger that when we start moving out of @entity32 and we no longer have repatriation ceremonies , people will heave a sigh of relief and say the war ’s over			0
for these guys , the battle is just beginning			0
' ' you realise your life is n't that bad ' : @entity199 , left , and @entity61 , right , with their statues @entity202 walks between the figures , cast in clear acrylic by @entity176 support : the display is sponsored by @entity207 , which delivered scotch to troops in @entity171			1
