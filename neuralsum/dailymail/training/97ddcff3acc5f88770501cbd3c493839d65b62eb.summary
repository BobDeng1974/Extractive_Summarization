campaign : sir @entity1 last week called for a boycott of @entity3 until it stops selling foie gras			2
plans to build a foie gras factory farm in @entity8 have now been withdrawn plans to build a massive foie gras factory farm in @entity8 have been withdrawn after a campaign backed by @entity13 actor @entity1 , it was claimed today			1
@entity15 company @entity14 was to have funded the £ 10million project to build one of the world ’s biggest facilities producing the liver pate , made by force - feeding ducks and geese			1
animal welfare campaigners said they had received confirmation from @entity8 that the construction will not go ahead			2
the decision is said to have been taken after months of appeals and petitions in @entity15 and @entity8			1
in april , @entity14 posted a note on its website saying the foie gras operation had been suspended as a result of ' concerns from the public '			2
the company ’s directors called for a review ' to include input from animal welfare and environmental experts to address any issues which may or may not exist '			2
a spokesperson for @entity43 ( @entity44 ) , one of the animal welfare charities involved , said the project was ' definitely not going ahead '			1
the facility in @entity8 ’s @entity49 would have slaughtered eight million ducks and two million geese a year to produce 1,000 tonnes of foie gras			1
the news comes a week after sir @entity1 , 84 , who played @entity13 in seven movies , accused upmarket department store @entity3 of selling ' torture in a tin ' at its @entity59 store			2
he also claimed the retailer was trying to ' hoodwink ' shoppers into believing that foie gras is ethically sourced			0
sir @entity1 's comments followed an investigation by animal rights group @entity66 ( @entity66 ) , which he said found that some birds were unable to stand because they were so ' desperately ill '			0
the actor said in a petition letter : ' for years , @entity3 – one of the few remaining shops that still sell the vile product foie gras – have been attempting to hoodwink the public into believing that the foie gras it sells in its food hall and restaurants is " ethical "			0
' now , thanks only to @entity66 , we know that company ’s claims are a sham			0
' controversial : concerns have been raised about foie gras because its production involves force - feeding grain and fat to geese or ducks a geese farm in @entity91			1
the foie gras facility in @entity8 's @entity49 would have slaughtered eight million ducks and two million geese a year ( file picture ) the actor said that @entity66 's film showed terrible conditions at farms which supply the company that provides foie gras to @entity3			1
the retailer said it would investigate @entity66 's allegations , but said some of the footage was not taken at farms it used as suppliers			0
a spokesman told the @entity110 : ' we have instructed the appropriate individuals within the business to look into the allegations			0
' making the delicacy typically involves force - feeding birds by placing a tube down their throats and pumping large amounts of food directly into their stomachs			1
this causes the liver to become enlarged by up to ten times its normal size			1
foie gras force - feeding is banned in @entity15 , but the product is still available from fine food specialists and in restaurants			1
the campaign against the factory farm was backed by @entity44 , @entity132 , and the @entity133 , among others			0

investigation : @entity3 last week said it maintained ' rigorous quality control procedures ' @entity147 , the charity ’s director , said : ' the abandoning of plans to construct this massive foie gras production facility in @entity8 is a great example of animal protection groups across the world using their collective reach to challenge animal cruelty			1
' the forced feeding of birds for foie gras production is illegal in our own country , and the @entity15 public will not tolerate investments in such cruel practices by @entity15 companies overseas			1
' a man answering the phone at a contact number listed on @entity14 ’ website , who said he was authorised to handle press inquiries , refused to discuss the fate of the foie gras facility			2
he said : ' any announcements will be made to the market			2
