not content with journeying to remote lands , @entity0 has now decided to go underwater			0
using scooters with specially - designed cameras , divers are currently documenting sea life from the bottom of @entity7 as well as the waters of @entity10 and @entity11 beaches			1
the images , created with the help of @entity14 , could provide scientists with information about how the harbour is changing and reveal the incredible marine life beneath the surface to its one billion viewers			2
complete with their own propulsion system , the images are captured through a spherical camera housing that allows continuous high - resolution , 360 - degree imagery to be collected as divers steer through the reefs			1
on a typical run it will capture over 1000 panoramas , which are then stitched together to produce a virtual dive experience			0
so far ship wrecks , pink boulders , bull sharks , bright green kelp beds and discarded bathtubs have all been uncovered as part of @entity0 ’s adventures in @entity7			1
‘ we tend to think of the harbour as a monolithic and flat surface , but people will be blown away by what is happening underneath , ’ professor @entity48 , from the @entity49 told @entity50			0
‘ the amazing kelp forests , underwater gardens of sea tulips and sponges and fish that they have never seen			2
the diversity of sea life is greater than any harbour in the world			1
’ the first ever tablet - operated underwater camera , dubbed @entity67 , is being used to take the footage			1
divers using underwater scooters have begun filming footage from the bottom of @entity7 as well as @entity10 and @entity11 beaches to create a @entity0 ' @entity74 ' professor @entity48 , from the @entity49			1

the camera has already attracted the attention of bull sharks , which are prevalent in the area , because of the electrical impulses created by the equipment			1
as well as sharks , one of the challenges facing @entity0 is the turbidity of the harbour water would probably prevent them from filming further west than @entity88 and no deeper than 10 metres			0
similar surveys have previously taken place on the @entity115 and @entity116			0
the project 's launch comes as @entity0 began using its all - seeing backpack contraption called ‘ @entity120 ’ in @entity7 last month			0
@entity121 uses a 4ft , 40lb backpack fitted with a 15 - angle lens camera to take 360 - degree pictures every 2.5 seconds in public places , with the images added to @entity0 on @entity127			0
trekker is being used to collect imagery of places only accessible by foot to incorporate into @entity0			0
from @entity7 harbour , @entity0 will collect images for a launch at the @entity24 being held in @entity7 this november			0
to create the amazing underwater images , @entity0 and the @entity27 survey developed the first ever tablet - operated underwater cameras			1
