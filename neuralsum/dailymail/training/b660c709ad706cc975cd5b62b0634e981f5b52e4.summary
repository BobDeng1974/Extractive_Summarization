the @entity1 rugby team will have the weight of the nation on their shoulders at the @entity5 2015 on home soil , but they will at least know that a herbal cocoon body wrap will be close to hand			1
with all things going to plan , the @entity10 - coached hosts could spend the preparations for all but one game at the @entity5 - a group a match in @entity16 - in their favoured headquarters at @entity18 in @entity19			1
@entity20 and his team - mates will be based at the @entity23 facility and have access to not just the expertly kept football pitch but @entity26 , where whatever body or beauty treatment they could possibly desire will be found			1
headquarters : @entity18 in @entity19 where @entity1 's rugby team will stay during the @entity5 perfect preparation : @entity20 and his @entity1 side will be at their preferred @entity23 resort winding down : after a tough day @entity1 will have access to a wide array of spa facilities the hotel 's adjoining spa offers a wide range of treatments including de-stress hot stone or vitality massages that could prove a godsend after a battering 80 minutes of action at @entity49			1
and if they really want to feel special they could get a man - i - cure , pedicure for men or a @entity56 â€™s tonic facial			0
the football pitch is pristine , as discovered by the visiting @entity59 team the @entity60 during their recent stay there before their match at @entity64			1
the gym is fully equipped for elite athletes with @entity68 equipment , each with its own entertainment system , and a @entity71 sprung exercise studio			0
there 's also a wide range of classes such as pilates , yoga and aqua aerobics if they 're up for some ' extras '			0
if it 's outdoor relaxation that 's required , the nine - hole golf course , pools and hot tubs should do the trick			2
@entity87 : no two bedrooms are the same but each has handcrafted mattresses and a pillow menu paddock to plate : @entity95 's @entity94 has two @entity97 stars to its name deluxe : the pool at @entity26 , the luxury facility @entity10 's side will have access to extra comfort : one of the bathroom designs , @entity106 , has two free standing white volcanic limestone baths with a @entity109 chiller between them and a large flat screen television recessed into the wall dining wise , haute cuisine may not be on the menu for the burly rugby players mid-tournament but it 's on offer for the rest of us at two deluxe restaurants - two @entity121 - starred @entity94 , with chef @entity95 , and the more laid - back @entity122			1
no worries about @entity1 's chargers not getting a good rest between matches either , with the five - star accommodation extending to hand - crafted mattresses and a pillow menu in each individually designed room			2
but there could be a worry of them becoming a little too precious with their underfloor heated bathrooms , oversized shower heads and side rain bars			0
the country mansion - styled @entity139 is perfect place for a tipple at the end of the day also			0
though that will be largely off limits to the players until they have the @entity147 trophy in their grasp			0
winding down : an overview of @entity26 in the evening at @entity18 n @entity23 ultimate tourists : @entity59 team the @entity60 training at @entity18 last week			2

@entity1 's @entity5 team will stay at @entity19 resort @entity18
the hotel and resort has been the side 's training base *previously*
it *boasts* two @entity97 - starred restaurant @entity164 and the spa
their hard yards will be done on the football pitch and in high - tech gym
