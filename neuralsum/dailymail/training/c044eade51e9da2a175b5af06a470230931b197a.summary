by @entity0 published : 20:16 est , 16 february 2013 updated : 10:45 est , 18 february 2013 we might be appalled at having unknowingly eaten horse , but as a horse lover , i believe we need a horsemeat trade in @entity6			1
if used properly , it could solve some of our desperate horse welfare problems			1
i worked as head of news for @entity11 , the @entity6 ’s equestrian bible , for six years			0
during that time , i was horrified by daily stories of neglect			0
not necessarily the sort of neglect that results in an @entity18 prosecution , but nonetheless brought about by owners shirking responsibility			0
we call ourselves a nation of animal lovers , but there is a growing crisis in the horse world and our charities are awash with unwanted and abandoned equines			1
in a minority : horse lover @entity0 , pictured riding in @entity31 , believes that selling horses for food could put a stop to welfare problems such as neglect the sheer expense of keeping a horse means that prices – even of decent competition animals – have plummeted with the economy			1
these days , low - value animals and horses that can no longer be ridden – either through injury , old age or bad behaviour – can barely even be given away			1
as a result , they often languish , neglected and forgotten , in fields			0
last year , more than 700 horses were reported abandoned to the horse sanctuary @entity52 – up from 160 in 2009			1
another charity , @entity54 , last year rescued double the number of horses it did in 2006			1
why is this happening ? aside from financial issues , it ’s because we have bred too many low - standard animals for too long and we ca n’t face up to our responsibilities			1
when my ex-racehorse could no longer be ridden because of injury , i chose to have him destroyed			0
the alternative was to leave him in a field , unhappy and in pain			0
by having him put down , i knew his suffering was over			0
i am , however , in the minority of owners who choose humane destruction			0
one reason is that disposing of a horse is not cheap : a vet will charge at least £ 150 to put one down			2
neglected : hundreds of horses , such as this animal in @entity81 , have to be rescued every year as it is too expensive for owner 's to look after them , or have them put down even then it is illegal to bury a horse unless you get an individual licence , so the body must then be disposed of at a cost of between £ 100 and £ 400 , usually by either a local hunt kennels or a knackerman			1
the horse ’s carcass will be incinerated or fed to the hounds or animals at a local zoo			0
if you want your horse cremated and its ashes returned , you can say goodbye to nearly £ 1,000			2
but there is a ready market in continental @entity104 for horsemeat			2
and the slaughter trade provides a humane and logical way to dispose of unwanted animals			2
there is a financial incentive , too			0
if a horse has not been given drugs unsafe for human consumption , an abattoir will pay roughly £ 300 for it			2
in 2008 , @entity11 investigated horse dealer @entity116 , who was found with more than 100 horses in various stages of ill - health and decay on his farm in @entity123			2
at the time , no one could work out why he had them			0
there are an estimated one million horses in the @entity6 and the ones swilling around at the bottom of the market can be bought by dealers for as little as a fiver at auction – and sold on for meat			1
humane : @entity0 says horse meat is consumed by millions of people in continental @entity104 , such as shoppers at this horsemeat butcher shop in @entity141 people hoped this trade in unfit horses would slow in 2004 when the @entity144 introduced horse passports to track what drugs a horse had been given			1
if the horse had been given the painkiller phenylbutazone , or ‘ bute ’ , it would be signed as unfit for human consumption			0
but @entity154 failed to police the system and until recently it has been easy to circumvent the scheme			0
each year , about 10,000 horses are sold for meat in the @entity6			1
native ponies make up a proportion of that number , and around 1,000 racehorses end up in the food chain each year , too			1
however , the @entity164 has just announced that the number bred for racing in @entity6 and @entity167 has fallen by just under a third compared with five years ago – meaning fewer will finish their careers unwanted at an abattoir			0
so the majority must be leisure horses , finding their way there via a dealer			2
in all my years at @entity11 , and as a horse owner , i do n’t know of a single person who has sold a horse for meat – or admitted to it			1
but why not ? we eat cows , sheep and chickens , so what ’s wrong with allowing people to eat horse ? the horse is a meat animal consumed by millions in continental @entity104			2
if humane destruction at a well - regulated abattoir in the @entity6 is the kindest option , is n’t that preferable to allowing a beautiful animal to suffer ? i think so .			0

@entity0 believes horsemeat trade could end welfare issues
last year more than 700 horses reported as abandoned
horses can be bought for £ 5 at auction and sold as meat
