by @entity0 being a bridesmaid , especially for your sister , should be one of the proudest days of your life and certainly not one of the most embarrassing			2
but for mother - of - three , @entity8 , it was the latter scenario that turned out to be the case			1

then size 18 , she had ordered a dress one size too small in the hope she could lose enough weight for the wedding			1
but instead she managed to pile on the pounds and rip the dress just minutes before the @entity8 was forced to fashion a bow to tie around the middle to hide her modesty as she walked with her sister down the aisle			1
the extremely humiliating experience spurred her on to join her local @entity44 and has now dropped to a very svelte 9st 5lbs and a trim size 10			2

' it was not one of my best moments and i was really embarrassed and just felt really stupid			2
' i thought if i got the next size down it would spur me to lose weight , but i think i was in a little bit of denial			0
' it was just horrible , one of my lowest points , but it kick - started me into losing weight for good			2

' i decided i wanted my active life back , i wanted to enjoy my children growing up and be able to wear what i wanted , ' she said			2

i 'd lose most of it and then fall pregnant again			0

' it was great for me because i lost all enthusiasm to go to the gym and the group focused on healthy eating			0
' i cook everything from scratch now , it just tastes lovely , and i ca n't get enough fruit and veg			0
i just love my size now , i feel so much better			0
