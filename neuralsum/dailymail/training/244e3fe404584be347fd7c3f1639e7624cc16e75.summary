@entity1 striker @entity0 joined @entity2 three days before the transfer window shut in a player - exchange deal which saw @entity5 head the other way to @entity7			1
he scored his first goal for the @entity9 , his third @entity11 club , in last weekend 's 2 - 2 draw with @entity13			1
before you read his second @entity15 , check out his video … in football you have to be ready to make changes quickly and that has happened to me			1
i have moved from @entity7 to @entity2 and this is a new chance to make a mark , to show what i can do			1
i like what i am seeing so far			1
i have only been here a short time but already it feels comfortable and i ’m happy			2
the gaffer , @entity27 , is a man i like working with			2
his team talks , before and during matches , are very good			2
he is a passionate man who knows how to get a point across			2
he does n’t join in with training too much , but every now and then the ball will come near him and he ’ll do something – he can still hit a great volley ! i also like his tactics			2
we are playing some very good football and doing well , even if the @entity11 is crazy this year			1
but the manager has been calm about it			2
he knows what he wants us to do and we are doing it			2
when you have that clear idea of what a manager wants it makes changing team much easier			2
i scored against @entity13 and that helps too – it ’s always important to get going fast			2
city slicker : @entity0 ( left ) swapped @entity7 for @entity2 in the winter transfer window and is loving life under @entity27 ( right ) at the @entity54 the style of football is important			1
i must admit i was frustrated at @entity7			1
i enjoyed being there , with a really nice group of players and good people as well			2
but the style of football under @entity63 was not really right for me			1
it was effective in the @entity65 but not in the @entity11			1
we played a lot of long balls and sometimes we did n’t really have wingers			2
as a striker , you can get isolated that way			2
the spirit in the team was excellent , though			0
i stay in touch with @entity76 by text and i look forward to seeing the boys when we go there to play in april			1
things change and you move on			0
finishing touch : @entity13 's @entity86 ( left ) is unable to stop @entity0 's effort during the 2 - 2 draw bluebird buddy : @entity0 has maintained his friendship with @entity7 captain @entity76 , here celebrating his goal against @entity92 with @entity93 for me , football is always more important than just liking a place			1
i wanted to move on for the sake of my football			1
there is a hassle that goes with it that maybe people do not understand			0
you go through the process of leaving a place , finding a new home , getting settled in			0
luckily for me , my wife is very supportive			0
her and i and our baby have moved into a small apartment for now and we will move into our old house in the summer			1
i still have a house in the @entity113 from my time at @entity114 and there is a player on loan currently living there			1
we ’ll move in during the summer			0
my wife is expecting another boy in june so it is an exciting time for our family			0
@entity2 is probably a better fit for me in a football sense			1
we play the ball to feet more , which is great for me			1
and more often than not i am playing off someone , rather than being the target myself			1
it suits my game more			0
it creates more shooting chances and that is what every striker wants			0
i had n’t had a proper shooting chance in a while before the @entity137 game so to get that sight of goal and then to score felt great			0
these things matter to a striker			0
the whole place feels good right now			0
@entity2 have this brilliant training ground , and that is good when you are a player			1
it is where you go to work every day			0
and the medical team is very good , very professional			0
when i arrived , i was having cramps at first because i had not been playing 90 minutes – i had been getting taken off in games at @entity7			1
now i am feeling sharper and up to speed again			0
the @entity11 has been crazy so far			1
i have been around it for quite a long time and i have not seen it quite like this before			0
normally , you have some idea of who is going to win and who is going to go down			0
there are maybe a couple of teams in the top half of the table who look like they will stay where they are			1
the other 18 are moving all the time			0
what 's the @entity169 ? @entity0 clips the heels of @entity173 signing @entity169 during @entity2 's 2 - 1 win at the @entity54 the screamer : @entity0 reacts to missing a chance v @entity13 a few weeks ago you would have looked at the table and thought @entity179 and @entity137 were going down			1
new managers have come in and totally changed their circumstances			0
then you have @entity183 , who were struggling quite badly and then they get a draw against @entity186 at @entity187			0
it is hard to say what will happen			0
the top of the table is more exciting than it has been for years			1
as a player , you find it quite stressful but also very exciting			1
there is so much on every game			0
even now , at the start of february , it feels like the games mean so much			0
if you go four or five games without winning you are going to be in huge trouble			0
if you go four or five games without losing , you will jump up the table			0
i think this next month will be crucial .			0

i was frustrated with the football at @entity7 , it was effective for the *championship*
