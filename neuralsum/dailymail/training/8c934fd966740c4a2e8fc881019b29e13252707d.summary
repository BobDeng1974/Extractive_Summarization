' you have an etching by the artist @entity6 , a very famous @entity54 painter and printmaker , ' said @entity56 , the show 's appraiser			1
how much do you think it 's worth ? @entity1 's @entity56 ( right ) valued the etching at $ 250,000 @entity6 ( 1882 - 1967 ) : as an artist he was known for scenes of contemporary @entity54 life , including the famous painting of people in a diner , ' @entity67 ' and latterly his etchings @entity6 was a prominent @entity54 realist painter and printmaker			1
