' i am so concerned about my 13 - year - old grandson			1
he is ruining life for his parents and two younger siblings ' ( picture posed by model ) i am so concerned about my 13 - year - old grandson			1
he is ruining life for his parents and two younger siblings			2
i lose sleep at night worrying			2
he has a violent temper which erupts when he is told off , and although he is , or was , a very clever grammar school boy , he wo n’t do homework or take pride in his appearance			2
he steals food – a six - pack of desserts from the fridge , or a whole packet of biscuits			1
last week his dad had money taken from his wallet			2
we know it was him , to buy sweets			2
our gp suggested he has an eating disorder and we ’re now waiting for a specialist referral			2
but i wonder if he could have @entity31 ’s syndrome , or depression			2
can you advise us please and suggest coping strategies ? this is a terribly sad , complex problem made all the more difficult because of the ripple effect this boy ’s behaviour is having on the whole family			1
at the centre is a teenager who used to be happy and now is desperately in need of love and support from the family he appears to be rejecting			1
rather than looking for coping strategies , it ’s his change in personality that needs exploring			1
normal teenage angst could be the reason : not every child sails through adolescence			2
but it is equally possible that he is depressed , terribly anxious or suffering self - esteem issues			1
focusing on the food aspect is wrong : it ’s just one of many self - destructive symptoms			1
an eating disorder assessment can take time , and is not a holistic approach to his troubles			2
it is unlikely he has developed @entity31 ’s at this age given his lack of previous symptoms but i am concerned that what you describe is more than simply a difficult teenager			1
his parents need to go back to the @entity27 and ask for a mental health assessment with the child and adolescent mental health service ( @entity78 ) team : they not only offer assessment and therapy , they will also look at support for the family			2
although he appears to want to destroy everything around him he is simply trying to exert control over his life ; perhaps he feels out of control with his feelings or rules from home			1
could his choices for food be more flexible and free ? with a situation like this it is very easy for parents to slip into a very negative rhetoric , whereas what he needs is a more positive approach			2
given his behaviour , praising him must be hard			0
but love , support and encouragement as well as safe , clear boundaries are what he needs			0
my husband went to see his gp with a suspicious mole on his back – partly black , partly pink and bleeding intermittently – in september 2012 and was told it was ‘ nothing to worry about ’			0
malignant melanoma is not always easy to diagnose still worried , six months later he saw a different gp			1
by october last year there were tumours in his abdomen , bowel and spine			0
he passed away in february , and suffered greatly			0
we are devastated , as he was always careful in the sun – and want people to know more about this deadly cancer			0
i am so sorry for your loss			0
it is not always easy to diagnose melanoma – there are roughly 9,000 a cases a year so the majority of moles a @entity27 will assess will be benign			1
however , sadly , your instinct was right			0
a mole that is bleeding and has different colours warrants further assessment			0
other red flags are an irregular border , rapid growth and asymmetry : this should have instigated a referral to a dermatologist within the @entity149 guidelines of two weeks			0
we must never assume that someone who covers up in the sun will not get skin cancer : melanoma is associated with sun exposure particularly as a child but there are other risk factors too including being fair - skinned , having a lot of moles and family history			1
in any medical situation , it is never wrong to listen to your instinct and push for a timely second opinion			0
drug companies are yet to bring out a female version of @entity168 – despite spending billions on research			0
there are treatments , mainly available privately , such as testosterone or other hormonal therapies			0
but critics point out that for women , unlike men , the problem is n’t a mechanical one that can be fixed with a pill			0
@entity180 will soon play @entity181 in @entity181			1
' if only they could distill him into tablet form , ' said dr @entity185 we are more cerebral creatures			1
with this in mind , i have greatly enjoyed @entity190 on @entity191 , starring the delectable @entity180 , pictured above with @entity192			1
he is to appear as @entity181 in the film of @entity181 , a book that has undoubtedly done more to enhance women ’s sex lives than all the potions the pharmaceutical giants can muster			0
if only they could distil him into tablet form			1
not a week goes by without some new diet advice that promises to release the nation from the grip of obesity			0
dr @entity185 said it seemed ' rather ridiculous ' to opt for a supposedly ' healthier ' whisky if you consume vastly more alcohol this week , we ’ve been told which alcoholic drinks to opt for on the basis of lower sugar content			1
whatever the opinion of my esteemed colleagues at @entity217 , it seems rather ridiculous to opt for a supposedly ‘ healthier ’ whisky if you consume vastly more alcohol			0
while cutting sugar is the new fad , let ’s stick to proven sensible health advice for a nation of big drinkers : keep alcohol intake down , never mind the sugar			1
and a word of caution about the other big diet story this week – research seemingly showing we should aiming for seven or even 10 portions of fruit and veg a day			0
researchers claimed that those eating more portions of fruit and veg were less likely to die			0
but the study did n’t ask about other dietary intake nor exercise levels			1
so while they showed people who eat more veg live longer , they ca n’t say if it is because of this , or because they also tend to be the people who exercise and avoid junk food			0
a few more frozen peas is n’t a cure for an unhealthy lifestyle .			0
