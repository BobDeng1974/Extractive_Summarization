by @entity0 plain cigarette packaging has no branding or advertising on the box , instead coming only with a plain description of the product and a large warning label unbranded cigarettes may not stop people from smoking according to new research in @entity11 where cigarette packets are already unbranded			1
industry data from @entity11 has warned plain packaging could lead to a rise in the sale of cigarette packs , because smokers , and potential smokers , will no longer care about buying expensive brands			1
the industry data suggests the amount of tobacco delivered to retailers has actually risen since the move to plain packaging was introduced in 2012			1
health campaigners have been vying for the plain packages all over the world , saying the move will protect children and potential new smokers who are attracted to branded packaging			1
the thinking is that potential smokers are less likely to buy packs of cigarettes if they are unbranded			0
the data comes as leaders of the industry have announced that they intend to present an independent report to ministers , calling for a review of the banning of branded cigarette packs			2
@entity43 , the manufacturers of @entity45 cigarettes , released data from @entity11 , which introduced the ban on plain packaging on december 1 , 2012 , which suggests that they have had a rise in deliveries of tobacco for the first time in five years			1
their data suggests that unbranded cigarette packets have reversed the downward trend of the fall in people buying cigarettes , and that people may potentially be buying more			2
it says that in 2013 after a year of unbranded packaging , tobacco firms in @entity11 sold the equivalent of 21.074 cigarettes - a rise of 0.3 per cent after four years of bad sales , while the sales of loose tobacco used in roll - up cigarettes increased 3.4 per cent			1
health campaigners and anti-smoking groups previously said they were concerned about this potential result from instituting unbranded packaging			0
however , they also say a ban on branded packaging is not enough , and that harsher taxes to increase the price of cigarettes should also be instituted to dissuade people even more			1
the proposal for plain packs in the @entity84 was intended to reduce the amount of children and teenagers that would ordinarily be drawn to smoking because of branded packaging , which can make a cigarette packet seem more attractive			1
@entity89 has been toying with the possibility of a @entity84 ban , and in november 2013 they ordered an independent review of branded packaging to find out whether the ban would be effective			1
however , so far the issue is still under consideration , and no date has been given as to when a ban might be introduced in the @entity84			2
currently branded packaging in the @entity84 is still allowed , and the government has not set a date for the potential ban of branded packaging			1
however , parliament has been reviewing the issue , and have requested an independent review into whether banning branded packaging would be successful			2
the key facts on tobacco sales in the @entity84 are : the @entity107 banned all advertising of tobacco products as a part of the @entity111 in 2002 , which banned tobacco advertising in the following order : the new data from the tobacco industry suggests that the plain packaging in @entity11 has actually increased sales of cigarettes and loose tobacco , the reverse effect from the agenda of plain packaging the @entity84 wanted to wait for the results of the @entity11 ban on branded packaging in 2012 before making a decision			1
@entity127 , director of @entity128 believes that the data is a deliberate attempt to promote the agenda of the cigarette and tobacco companies			0
she said : ' we are repeatedly seeing attempts to undermine the case for standardised packaging			0
' it is about dissuading them from taking up smoking - and one year 's data from @entity11 about delivery levels of tobacco tells us nothing about that			2
@entity146 , director of corporate affairs for @entity43 in @entity84 believes that the implications that the data from his company bring to light need to be examined			0
he said : ' if people are buying cheaper stuff , maybe they 're smoking more of it			0
' it 's definitely a point of interest and that 's something that absolutely needs to be explored because that 's the counter of what this policy is seeking to achieve			0
' electronic cigarettes are classed as ' medicines ' since tightened of nicotine - containing products a new report from the university of @entity166 in @entity167 suggests that while e-cigarettes are promoted as aids to help people stop smoking , they are not stopping people smoking			0
the study was conducted with data from 949 smokers ( 88 of the smokers using e-cigarettes at baseline ) to determine if e-cigarettes were associated with more successful quitting or reduced cigarette consumption			0
but the results were that more women , younger adults and people with less education used e-cigarettes , and that e-cigarette use among their test subjects did not reduce cigarette consumption or help people quit			0
@entity190 , the author of the study , said : ' nonetheless , our data add to the current evidence that e-cigarettes may not increase rates of smoking cessation			0
' regulations should prohibit advertising claiming or suggesting that e-cigarettes are effective smoking cessation devices until claims are supported by scientific evidence			0

data from tobacco industry says plain packaging may increase smoking

lack of branding is *designed* to make packets less attractive
but tobacco sales in @entity11 increased despite brand - free packets
