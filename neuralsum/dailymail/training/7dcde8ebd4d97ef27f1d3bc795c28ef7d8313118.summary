@entity0 and @entity2 hooker @entity1 is likely to learn the outcome of his latest disciplinary hearing before @entity6			1
@entity2 look set to mount a robust defence of their captain after he was sent off for elbowing @entity11 centre @entity9 in the face at @entity13 on saturday			1
@entity1 could miss at least the start of @entity0 's @entity16 campaign following the latest episode in a career scarred by repeated disciplinary episodes			1
@entity1 ( right ) was adjudged to elbow @entity11 's @entity9 ( left ) before the pair had to be separated @entity0 international @entity1 seems perplexed at why he has been sent off at @entity13 @entity1 cuts a dejected figure trudging off the pitch after his sending off as his disciplinary woes continue april 2007 : banned for 26 weeks after gouging @entity24 ’ @entity26 and @entity27			1
march 2010 : claims of gouging versus @entity28 dropped when alleged victim , @entity31 , chose not to complain			0
march 2012 : banned for eight weeks for biting @entity33 flanker @entity32 during @entity34			0
june 2012 : sin - binned against @entity35 in first game as @entity0 captain			1
december 2012 : given a two - week ban for striking @entity40 ’s @entity39			1
may 2013 : eleven - week ban after being sent off for swearing			1
december 2014 : sent off for elbowing @entity11 ’s @entity9			1
the @entity43 has yet to confirm when 28 - year - old @entity1 's hearing will take place but moves are afoot for it to be held on tuesday evening			1
@entity1 was handed a 26 - week ban for eye - gouging in 2007 , and an 11 - week suspension for verbally abusing referee @entity50 during the 2013 @entity52 final against @entity11			1
that latter ban led to him missing the @entity55 tour of @entity56 , and @entity43 disciplinary chiefs could easily take a dim view of his latest indiscretion			0
it happened after just 17 minutes of a titanic @entity52 east midlands derby that @entity2 won 23 - 19 thanks to substitute @entity64 's 77th - minute try that fly - half @entity65 converted from the touchline			1
referee @entity68 initially seemed happy to award @entity1 a yellow card , but television match official @entity70 urged @entity68 to watch further replays , and he responded by sending 61 times - capped @entity1 off			2
@entity0 international @entity72 attempts to avoid the tackle of @entity74 on saturday afternoon ' it was disappointing , ' @entity2 rugby director @entity75 said			2
' @entity1 has got to keep his arms down , but he was being held and i do n't know there was any malice in it			2
' the nature of the game did n't justify a red card			0
i think @entity9 went down pretty easily , to be honest , which was disappointing			2
' it is a tough game			0
that 80 minutes of rugby was hard , physical with some great tackles , but i do n't think there was any malice in that			0
i think @entity68 's initial reaction of the yellow card would have been the correct decision			0
' @entity95 touches down his second try during the 23 - 19 defeat at @entity2 on saturday @entity0 open their @entity34 campaign against @entity99 in @entity100 on february 6 , and given @entity1 's poor record - biting and punching offences also appear on his charge - sheet - another lengthy suspension appears likely			1
' it 's a tough game , and @entity1 plays to the edge			2
you would n't change @entity1			0
he is competitive , ' @entity75 added			0
' it is a difficult one			0
i think he should have kept his arms down - we are not saying that what he did was right - but what i am probably saying is that the opposition made it a lot easier , and a yellow card was sufficient			0
' @entity2 replacement @entity116 crosses for the match - winning try three minutes before full - time asked for his reaction to the @entity1 dismissal , @entity11 rugby director @entity119 said : ' if you strike someone in the face you are liable to get yourself in trouble			1
that 's the nature of it			0
' you would have thought he might have learnt a lesson by now			0
that 's just the way it is			0
' @entity116 is mobbed his his team - mates as the 14 - man @entity134 celebrate a famous win over their arch - rivals			2
