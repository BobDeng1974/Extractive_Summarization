by @entity0 pregnant woman who eat junk food or consume sugary drinks prior to getting pregnant are 50 per cent more likely to have a premature baby , an @entity2 scientific study has found mothers - to - be who eat junk food and sugary snacks are more likely to have premature babies , according to a new report			1
university research has for the first time confirmed that women who eat a poor diet before they become pregnant are around 50 per cent more likely to have a preterm birth than those on a healthy diet			1
researchers at the @entity24 's @entity23 investigated the dietary patterns of more than 300 @entity2 women to better understand their eating habits before pregnancy			1
it is the first study of its kind to assess women 's diet prior to conception and its association with outcomes at birth			2
the results , published in @entity39 , show that women who consistently ate a diet high in protein and fruit prior to becoming pregnant were less likely to have a preterm birth , while those who consistently ate high fat and sugar foods and takeaway were about 50 per cent more likely to have a preterm birth			2
dr @entity49 , post doctoral @entity50 with the @entity23 said : ' preterm birth is a leading cause of infant disease and death and occurs in approximately one in 10 pregnancies globally			0
anything we can do to better understand the conditions that lead to preterm birth will be important in helping to improve survival and long - term health outcomes for children			1
' ' in our study , women who ate protein - rich foods including lean meats , fish and chicken , as well as fruit , whole grains and vegetables , had significantly lower risk of preterm birth			2
' a healthy diet increased the chance of a baby being born full - term while kebabs and sugary drinks made problems more likely dr @entity81 said : ' on the other hand , women who consumed mainly discretionary foods , such as takeaway , potato chips , cakes , biscuits , and other foods high in saturated fat and sugar were more likely to have babies born preterm			1
' ' it is important to consume a healthy diet before as well as during pregnancy to support the best outcomes for the mum and baby			0
' she added : ' diet is an important risk factor that can be modified			0
it is never too late to make a positive change			0
we hope our work will help promote a healthy diet before and during pregnancy			0
this will help to reduce the number of neonatal deaths and improve the overall health of children			0

@entity2 researchers find link between junk - food and *pre-term* babies
women hoping to get pregnant *warned* against eating take - aways and sugary drinks
eating healthily before pregnancy improves any baby 's long - term health as well
