from a camera perched atop a sideline tower on the @entity4 practice field , it seemed like @entity6 quarterback @entity5 misread a particular play			1
the camera hovering five feet over his head showed otherwise			0
with the help of an affordable $ 500 toy , @entity4 coaches and players are studying film like never before			1
the @entity6 are using a drone with a camera attached to capture their practices , now studying footage gleaned from its unusual vantage points along with what 's collected from more traditional places like sidelines and end zones			1
caught on camera : in this october 28 , 2014 , aerial photo provided by @entity28 , @entity4 quarterback @entity5 , front center , gestures before a play begins during an @entity34 college practice in @entity35 , @entity36 ' it 's all about getting the players information they need so they can play fast and execute , ' @entity4 coach @entity37 said			1
' this drone , in terms of quarterback play , i do n't know if there 's any other way to do it anymore			1
' @entity4 is n't the first to bring a drone into practices			2
@entity50 made headlines last spring when it revealed it has embraced the drone point of view , and @entity53 and @entity54 are among the few other schools who are known to have tinkered with the technology			1
@entity4 is n't just tinkering			0
the drone is necessary equipment now for the @entity6 , who are planning to acquire more and better ones soon , and it will soon be part of @entity4 's recruiting pitches			1
' we 've always been behind in sports when it comes to technology , ' @entity4 offensive coordinator @entity63 said			0
' coaches do n't like change			0
nobody does this , not the way we do this			0
' @entity63 said he started seriously thinking about bringing a drone into practice this summer			1
he was on vacation in the @entity77 and noticed one of the small devices hovering about			0
he eventually ordered a drone and five battery packs , since the flying time on each battery was only about eight minutes per charge			2
the @entity6 put the drone into regular use starting around late september , and it 's perhaps not a coincidence that @entity5 - the team 's true freshman quarterback - has been making better decisions ever since			1
' when you see from the drone 's point of view , you get a complete panoramic view of the field , ' @entity5 told @entity94			1
' you see what i 'm seeing			0
you see the whole field better and then it 's easier to show coaches what i was thinking at any given moment			1
' @entity63 calls it a game - changing advantage , and as he held a remote control monday inside the @entity4 offensive meeting room he eagerly displayed what he meant by showing the same play from various angles			0
@entity112 view : the @entity6 are using a $ 500 drone to capture scenes from their workouts , seeing things from players ' perspectives @entity5 was throwing the ball to a receiver on the right sideline , the far side of the field from where a camera atop a sideline tower was rolling			1
that angle , from perhaps as much as 60 yards away , suggested @entity5 's throw - which tailed back slightly toward the middle of the field before getting caught - should have been sent more down the sideline			1
without the drone , @entity63 would have chided @entity5 for the mistake			1
but the drone gave a much better angle of what the defender was doing , and why @entity5 moved his receiver slightly off the sideline to make the play			1
' you see that ? he did exactly what he was supposed to do , ' @entity63 said			0
' and i would n't have known that			0
that drone , we got to see exactly what he was seeing			2
we got to see his guy getting pushed toward the sideline , so he throws it away from the defensive back			0
there 's so much coaching that does n't happen because you do n't get all the angles			2
' the drone , which gets moved to show numerous angles in each practice , has also led to some interesting moments			2
players have been known to gesture wildly at the drone after making a big play			2
@entity5 had to learn to get used to having a machine buzzing - ' it 's like rabid @entity168 bees , ' he said - not far from his helmet			1
and during the week where @entity4 prepped for @entity171 , a higher - powered drone than what @entity4 uses was spotted at practice ; ultimately , it was deemed to be a fraternity prank			2
' i was thinking it was @entity171 , ' @entity5 said			2
' they 're pretty smart over there			0
' it was n't @entity171 , and spying is n't permitted under @entity34 rules			0
teams can use it at their own practices only , not games			0
one other small drawback : the angle is such that some players who suffer from motion sickness struggle to watch			0
' it 's close enough to the action , but you can see what 's going on in the whole field , ' @entity5 said			1
' every year , every college is looking to reinvent the wheel			0
you always have to come up with new ways , new technology			0
it 's good to keep up with the times			0

the @entity6 *football* team have started using a $ 500 drone to capture scenes from their workouts
