hundreds of dead animals are washing up along the shores of one of @entity4 's most biologically diverse estuary			1
more than 100 manatees , 300 pelicans and almost 50 dolphins were all found dead along the northern stretches of the @entity9 in @entity10			1
biologists are now trying to work out what the problem is , but there is no doubt that it is a serious one			2
murder mystery : two manatees out of 111 that have been found dead in the @entity9 in @entity10 dead in the water : day after day , dolphins are floating up dead , emaciated down to their skeletons saving wildlife : rescuers attend to a manatee affected by the unknown mystery killer			1
the manatees appeared to have abruptly sickened and drowned the lagoon contains more species than anywhere else in the @entity31 and to the towns along its edge — @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 , it accounts for hundreds of millions in revenue from angling , boating , bird - watching , tourism and other waterfront activities			1
its 156 miles of water boast more than 600 species of fish and more than 300 kinds of birds			1
the barrier island complex stretched across 40 percent of @entity10 ’s coast , around @entity53 , and consists of the @entity54 , the @entity55 and the @entity9			1
in the past , the lagoon has was constantly polluted by nutrients and fertilizers running off lawns and farms but now it appears some kind of tipping point has been reached			0
thousands of dead fish reported in @entity9 in southern @entity64			1
scientists believe it may be due to one or several causes from climate change to changes in water temperature and salt levels no obvious cause : @entity10 's @entity9 is considered one of the most diverse ecosystems in @entity4 investigation : @entity77 research assistant @entity76 during the rescue of a distressed dolphin in the @entity9 system in @entity10 manatees began dying in july 2012 , 43 of them in just one month			1
a total of 111 have died			0
the mysterious manatee die - off began in the northern part of the lagoon last july , hit its peak around march and now produces another dead manatee about every two weeks			2
biologists at a state laboratory in @entity91 examine every dead manatee that 's found in @entity10 for a cause of death			1
they appear to have abruptly fallen sick and drowned			0
people have reported between 250 and 300 dead pelicans since january			0
since january , the number of dead bottlenose dolphins has reached 46 - more than double the average recorded in previous years			2
the dolphins also look emaciated , similar to the pelicans			0
perplexed : so far , biologists are at a loss to explain the cause of the untimely deaths tests : two sub-adult @entity109 sea turtles , netted from the water , sit in a boat in the @entity9 with damp towels over their heads help to calm them recover : scientists believe it could take up to a decade before the lagoon recovers so far nobody can name the killer			1
biologists have some suspicions but are baffled about any connection among the species ' problems			1
the diets are different : manatees are vegetarians , while pelicans and dolphins eat fish			2
the symptoms are different : the manatees ' stomachs are stuffed , while the pelicans and dolphins are emaciated			0
this is not the first time that dolphins have perished in the @entity9			2
many died in 2001 and 2008 where again the cause of death was undetermined			0
it is difficult for scientists to work out why the deaths are occurring when there is not an obvious cause			2
with so much farmland , laws in @entity10 allow fertilizer to be poured into the coastal waters			1
this can have effects on acidity , changes in water temperature and salt levels			0
some are even suggesting global warming could be to blame			0
it is ideal for algae which need high levels of nutrients and salinity to survive			0
that can also have an adverse effect on the ecosystem 's food supply for other animals such as the dolphins			2
there are few positive signs			0
although the numbers pelican 's dying appear to have stopped , now a new brown tide bloom has been spotted			0
locals believe that if the lagoon is to ever recover , it could be close to a decade before things seem back to normal .			0

@entity9 of @entity10 contains more species than anywhere else in the @entity31
deaths of hundreds of animals , fish and birds have been occurring for more than a year
no specific cause can be found - biologists are perplexed
*theories* range from fertilizer pollution to climate change
