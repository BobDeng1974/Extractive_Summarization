by @entity1 reporter ' @entity3 's most patriotic rock band ' performed @entity3 's most patriotic song at @entity5 on saturday - and the reviews were far from proud			1
@entity8 's heavy rock rendition of the @entity3 national anthem had a few drivers chuckling and some fans shaking their heads before the @entity14 season opener			1

some of the athletes were not much nicer			0
' well , i wish they would just sing the damn song , ' driver @entity27 said after the race , which @entity29 won by a few feet			0
their rock version of @entity20 did n't sit well with the drivers and audience alike members of the band @entity8 perform the national anthem before the @entity14 auto race at @entity5 ' that is my reaction			1
' @entity50 described it as ' spectacularly awful ' and ' ridiculous '			1
the band 's version of @entity20 , a previous performance of which has more than five million views on @entity53 , was shortened for television purposes			1
nonetheless , the guitar - heavy interpretation seemed to catch @entity14 off guard			1
@entity27 and @entity61 had puzzled looks on their faces near the end of it			0
' yes , we took some liberties , ' lead singer @entity66 said before the performance			2
' but we were already taking some liberties with it musically and melodically			0
' we wanted to make it a rock song people could sing and enjoy			2
' the reverence is still there , but it has sort of taken on the death march in a way			0
' it 's very sullen and sung in a very sullen way			0
' we thought it should be more of a celebratory rock anthem			0
' not a fan : driver @entity27 is one people who spoke out against the performance @entity66 said the full version lasts about 4 minutes			2
the band , which performed a pre-race concert before the 2013 @entity14 finale in @entity89 , agreed to cut it in half for the race			1
' we knew it would be a door closer for us if it was n't accepted by @entity14 , ' @entity66 said			2
track president @entity96 defended his decision to bring in @entity8			2
' they 've played that rendition in the 2012 and 2013 @entity100 , ' @entity96 said			0
' they 've gotten very positive reviews socially and digitally in terms of that rendition			0
' the fact that they played the @entity106 was pretty impressive , but our fans are very opinionated and they make sure that they comment , and that 's their right			0
' we 'll listen to them , but at the end of the day , the band 's got a pretty good following and they 've done some really nice renditions at some very patriotic sporting events			1
