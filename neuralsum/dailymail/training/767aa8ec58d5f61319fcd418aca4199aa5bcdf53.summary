for @entity2 fans , @entity0 will see them wake up in receipt of a gift that not long ago was beyond even their wildest dreams			1
back in the dark days of relegation from the @entity14 in may , after administration and its accompanying 15 point deduction , little could those followers who merrily sang festive songs on repeat on tuesday night at @entity10 have dreamed of how 2014 would eventually pan out			1
this deserved win over @entity16 , achieved thanks to goals in either half from front two @entity20 and @entity21 , ensured @entity23 's relentless team streaked 12 points clear of nearest challengers @entity26			1
@entity21 doubles his side 's lead with a spectacular left foot strike from the edge of the box striker @entity21 volleyed into the top corner to seal a comfortable win for @entity2 @entity34 celebrates as his goal sealed the victory for the visitors at @entity10 on tuesday @entity16 : @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 ( @entity44 72 ) , @entity45 , @entity46 ( @entity47 81 ) , @entity48 , @entity49 ( @entity50 45 ) , @entity51 subs not used : @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 booked : @entity41 27 @entity2 : @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 ( @entity63 82 ) , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity21 , @entity20 ( @entity67 60 ) , @entity68 ( @entity69 87 ) subs not used : @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 scorer ( s ) : @entity20 25 , @entity21 62 referee : @entity77 attendance : 3,718 in wrapping up a remarkable 47 points out of the 51 available so far in the @entity82 , his side has outscored every team in the league , conceded less than any other and outclassed all			1
with @entity26 enmeshed in unprecedented turmoil this week – even by their miserable standards at troubled @entity88 – it 's tempting just to wrap up the title now and deliver it to @entity92 first thing on wednesday morning			1
@entity23 wo n't think like that , of course			0
ever the professional , the unexcitable @entity2 boss will instead preach the same mantra			1
that his side should merely focus on the next match , away to @entity98 on saturday , and aim to round off the year in style			0
but in truth would take a capitulation to far outstrip @entity102 in the 1956 @entity103 for the @entity105 club not to reclaim their place in the top flight after 12 months			1
indeed , @entity2 could even be 15 ahead by saturday evening , should @entity26 , in the wake of manager @entity109 leaving and his no 2 @entity111 's demotion , succumb to @entity113 at @entity114 in @entity116 's first match as a manager			1
@entity21 is congratulated by his team - mates as @entity2 opened up a 12 - point lead over @entity26 @entity20 wheels away in celebration after giving @entity2 the lead against @entity16 they used to say @entity109 the striker , long before his tough spell in management , could fall into the @entity127 and emerge holding a fish supper			1
the same , so far , is true for @entity23 in the dugout			0
he has barely put a foot wrong so far in his first post in management			0
given the unpredictable december weather , his bold decision to rearrange this match just 10 days after a frozen pitch rendered the game unplayable had been widely questioned			0
but @entity23 wanted it played , wanted it won , and last night he got his wish amid crisp and clear conditions on a decent playing surface			2
last night 's win was not luck , though , as @entity23 would surely point out			0
the @entity2 boss , who prides himself on his attention to detail , arranged a pre-season game here in the summer to familiarise himself with the dimensions of the @entity10 pitch			1
that prompted him to ditch his favoured 4 - 4 - 2 with wide midfielders in favour of a 4 - 3 - 1 - 2			1
it was left to his fullbacks @entity58 and @entity61 to prove the attacking width			0
@entity20 is mobbed by his team - mates after netting in the first half to set up an away victory @entity21 ( left ) vies for possession with @entity16 's @entity40 and it was a ploy that worked a treat with @entity61 's cutback setting up @entity20 for the crucial opening goal from six yards			1
it was the former @entity167 trainee 's third in his last three games , and his seventh of the season			0
it was full reward for @entity2 ' dominance from the first whistle , after both sets of fans had held an impeccably - observed minute 's silence in honour of all those affected by the horrific bin lorry tragedy in @entity181 on monday			1
@entity20 , the former @entity182 striker who elected not to go up with @entity182 to aid the @entity92 side 's promotion drive , nearly grabbed a quickfire second			2
but his fierce freekick from 20 yards beat keeper @entity187 only to smack back off the bottom left post and away to safety			0
as @entity2 searched for a second , @entity20 then set up @entity21 , whose shot fizzed narrowly wide of the post			1
@entity2 ' @entity68 ( right ) lunges into a challenge on @entity49 of @entity16 @entity16 were holding onto the ball well but @entity2 worked ever so hard to close them down the home side was largely restricted to shooting from distance in vain			1
on the one occasion they did slice through @entity2 , keeper @entity57 was the hero of the hour with a fine save from 16 yards			2
@entity51 , however , should have burst the net with his low drive			0
@entity23 then made the decision to replace @entity20 with @entity67 after 60 minutes ; a decision that was surely down to injury			2
if it was n't , no matter			0
the @entity2 boss ' @entity207 remained , as within 120 seconds his team was 2 - 0 up			1
@entity64 's cross was cleared and @entity21 first headed the ball , then chested it and finally blasted home a festive cracker from 20 yards			2
it was a quality goal that underlined the 20 - year - old 's versatility			0
@entity21 shone up front last night but in november he was called up by @entity219 for cover at his regular position , right back , after @entity222 had pulled out of matches against the @entity224 and @entity225			2
the @entity2 players observe a minute 's silence in memory of those who were tragically killed in an accident in @entity181 city centre on monday after that a shot fired into the side netting by sub @entity50 and a header from the same player saved by @entity57 was about as good as it got for @entity237 's men			2
they never looked like rescuing anything from this game and many home fans headed for the exits a good 20 minutes before time			0
the @entity2 fans , by contrast , remained to the end and were jubilant at the final whistle			2
they sported the delirious demeanour of a set of fans who have now not witnessed a league defeat on the road since at @entity252 on march 8			0
' we shall not be moved , ' they sang			0
and who , frankly , could disagree ?			0

hearts beat @entity16 2 - 0 at @entity10 in the @entity82
@entity20 opened the scoring for @entity2 the first half
@entity21 doubled the lead with a spectacular volley
win moves @entity2 12 points clear of @entity26 at the top of the league
