the bone - crunching , bloody world of rugby might seem an unusual place to find a shining example of ‘ new man ’			2
but according to @entity9 star @entity8 , his years on the pitch have given him the confidence to be hands - on with raising his children – especially when it comes to changing nappies			1
now he is fronting a campaign urging parents to take advantage of a new law that lets them share time off work after having a child			1
now he is fronting a campaign urging parents to take advantage of a new law that lets them share their parental leave something which should be no problem for the £ 200,000 - a - year @entity37 player and his pop star wife @entity26 , whose girl band @entity39 are said to be worth more than £ 2.5million			1
the @entity41 drive sees the fullback call on other fathers to take more time off to ensure their wives ’ earning potential is n’t hit by having a child			2
a law allowing parents to split time off after having a baby comes into force on april 5			1
it will mean that after an initial fortnight , they will be able to share the allowance of 50 weeks of leave and 37 weeks of pay			2
at the moment , men can take only two weeks off			2
@entity8 and @entity26 - pictured when she was pregnant with @entity27 in 2011 - are currently expecting their second child , they have one two year old daughter @entity27 already @entity8 , 29 , and his 33 - year - old wife have a two - year - old daughter , @entity27 , and are expecting a son next month			1
the player expects some mocking for his role in the @entity41 drive but believes rugby ’s rough and tumble world has made him a better father			0
he said : ‘ there will be some changing room banter			0
it ’s part and parcel of being a rugby player			0
‘ but to be honest , this campaign is making me look a lot cooler than some other stuff			0
there are six or seven young dads in the team and we take it seriously			0
being rugby players we are used to sweat , spit , blood and rolling around in the mud , so no one has a problem about getting their hands dirty changing nappies			0
‘ i do everything , all the nappy changing and feeding			0
i was there for @entity27 ’s first words and her first steps			0
’ @entity8 said the ‘ new man ’ approach is becoming increasingly common , even in the traditionally macho world of rugby			1
he added : ‘ in this day and age , women can just as easily be the main breadwinner as men			0
why should they have to give up their careers when they have children ? ’ @entity8 is already in a situation where his wife earns more than he does			1
@entity8 has been a hands on dad with his daughter @entity27 and is encouraging other men to follow his example @entity8 is a rugby player for the @entity37 and says he wishes he could spend more time with @entity27 the five members of @entity39 have had 13 top ten singles and were reported in 2012 to be collectively worth £ 2.6million			1
exact figures for her earnings and wealth are not known but her schedule will vary on whether she is recording and touring with @entity39 or working on a separate project or campaign			0
besides the £ 200,000 a year that @entity8 is thought to earn from his club , for which he will train for five to six hours a day , he was reported in 2013 to earn £ 15,000 for each @entity129 match with @entity9			1
@entity130 will this week encourage fathers to take advantage of the option to split leave			1
but a survey of 2,000 men and women by employment website @entity139 found three - quarters of men opposed the change , fearing loss of status and earning power .			2
