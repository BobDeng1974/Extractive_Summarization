@entity0 believes @entity1 have enough steeliness about them to succeed this season , despite a second - half collapse almost costing them in the @entity6			1
this is yet another campaign of transition in north @entity9 , with @entity10 the latest man charged with bringing success to @entity12			0
it has so far proven a bumpy ride for the @entity1 head coach , although thursday 's 2 - 1 defeat of @entity17 means they return to domestic action buoyed by three straight wins in all competitions			1
@entity0 rises to head home and put @entity1 2 - 0 up against @entity17 on thursday night the victory in @entity24 was far from straightforward , though , as a shocking , error - riddled second half allowed @entity17 to have 14 efforts of differing quality			1
a late @entity29 penalty and @entity31 red card led to a nervy ending , although first - half efforts from @entity34 and @entity0 proved enough of a cushion to secure the three points			2
' they came out of the blocks firing and they caught us on the back foot a bit , ' @entity0 said of the second - half performance in @entity44			2
' it 's disappointing the way we started the second half , but these are the sort of games where you have to hang in and dig deep			0
we managed to do that in the end and we are very happy			0
' @entity0 celebrates with @entity34 after his strike sealed the three points for @entity1 pleased with the result they may well be , but the performance again led @entity10 to speak of the need for his players to show more defensive resilience			1
it is a worryingly common complaint by the former @entity63 international , who rejected @entity66 coach @entity65 's recent suggestion that @entity1 are ' weak ' mentally			1
@entity0 , too , disagrees with such criticism and believes this week 's performances alone show they can move forward			2
asked if @entity1 have a steely enough mentality , he said : ' i think so			0
we had a great comeback in the @entity73 in the last game [ to win 2 - 1 at @entity75 ] and we dug deep to get the result here			1
' we 're doing well in this competition and if we win the next game at home to @entity81 that will see us through			0
@entity0 celebrates scoring a late winner for @entity1 at @entity75 last weekend ' you can develop it through results like this because it builds confidence			1
we all stuck together out there today when it got tough and you can only build from that			0
' when you go into other games you know that every player has got everyone else 's back and you 're going to fight through			0
' @entity1 will take that spirit into sunday 's @entity73 clash with @entity98 , when @entity0 will be hoping to make his first top - flight start of the campaign			1
many @entity1 fans have called for the 21 - year - old to get a role from the outset after a fine scoring run , which he made eight goals in as many games against @entity17			1
@entity1 manager @entity10 has been coming under pressure to play @entity0 from the start ' the most important thing was to get the three points , ' @entity0 said			1
' we got the win we wanted - it was a tough game but we got there in the end			0
' we 're very keen to get the three points on sunday in front of the home fans			0
we want to play well and impress and get the win			0
' if @entity0 starts to make a bigger impression in the league , expect him to be representing @entity66 sooner rather than later			1
fresh from helping the under - 21s side qualify for next summer 's @entity125 , senior boss @entity122 said at thursday 's squad announcement the senior team have their ' eyes on ' @entity0			2
@entity0 reacts as a chance goes by late on with @entity17 threatening to earn a share of the spoils ' i have n't heard about @entity122 but i will look out for it , ' he said when told of the comments			2
' it 's great that he has been talking about me and i have to keep my head down , keep doing what i 'm doing and i hope the rewards are there			0
' we 've got a lot of games coming up in a lot of competitions and i have to keep trying to impress and be ready when i 'm called on			0
