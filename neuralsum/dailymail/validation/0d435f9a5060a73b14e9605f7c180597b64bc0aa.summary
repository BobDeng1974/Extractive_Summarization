pharmacists will be drafted into gp practices to help ease pressure and combat a shortage of family doctors , under plans to be unveiled today			1
the proposals could see pharmacists stationed in surgeries to help meet the day - to - day needs of patients with long - term conditions , including diabetes and asthma			1
instead of seeing a gp , those patients could be given an appointment with a pharmacist			1
they would also liaise with hospitals , community pharmacists and care homes to ensure patients received seamless care			1
experts said the move would cut the time patients have to wait for appointments , while also addressing the chronic shortage of gps at a time when there is an oversupply of pharmacists			1
pharmacists are to be drafted into gp practices to help ease pressure and combat a shortage of family doctors in the @entity38 , under new plans many gp surgeries already work closely with pharmacists , and the proposals would see them working as part of the general team , in a similar way to practice nurses , the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) said			1
@entity48 , chairwoman of the @entity40 , said a ' hidden army ' of pharmacists could provide the solution to the pressures facing family doctors			0
she said : ' waiting times for a gp appointment are now a national talking point - and a national cause for concern , not least amongst @entity28 themselves			1
' but , even if we were to get an urgent influx of extra funding and more gps , we could not turn around the situation overnight due to the length of time it takes to train a gp			0
' yet we already have a ' hidden army ' of highly trained pharmacists who could provide a solution			0
' practice - based pharmacists , working as part of the clinical team , would relieve the pressure on gps and make a huge difference to patient care			1
' this is n't about having a pharmacy premises within a surgery , but about making full use of the pharmacist 's clinical skills to help patients and the overstretched gp workforce			2
' gp surgeries are predicted to make 370 million patient consultations this year - 70 million more than five years ago			1
an ageing population and an increase in those patients needing treatment for long - term and complex conditions , including diabetes and heart disease , is , in part , the cause of the mounting pressure			1
the @entity40 said according to their research , there will be 67 million occasions when patients will have to wait a week or longer to see a gp or practice nurse this year			2
pharmacists train for five years , one year less than a doctor and a year more than a nurse			0
as such , the @entity40 , which is being backed by the @entity104 , has argued they are ideally placed to treat patients directly within gp practices			1
the @entity40 is calling for general practice funding to be increased to 11 per cent of the @entity38 budget by 2017 - currently it stands at just over eight per cent			0
furthermore , the college is calling for 8,000 more gps in @entity112 by the end of the next @entity114			0
@entity115 , chairman of the @entity104 @entity112 board , said : ' general practice is the foundation of the @entity38 but it needs proper resourcing and support			0
experts said the move would cut the times patients have to wait for appointments , while also addressing the chronic shortage of gps at a time when there is an oversupply of pharmacists ' having a pharmacist as part of the team can make a huge difference to both patients and clinical colleagues			1
' pharmacists should be working in gp practices all over the country			2
it 's a win - win situation for everyone concerned			0
' we must be more strategic and change the services on offer to make best use of the @entity38 workforce			0
' patients deserve access to high quality care and services wherever they live and pharmacists are central to providing this			2
' dr @entity153 , @entity154 chairman at the @entity155 , said : ' placing more pharmacists into @entity154 practice teams is a move the @entity155 has been advocating for some time			2
' this proposal has the potential to improve the skills mix in local gp services and raise the number of healthcare professionals on hand to provide help to patients			2
' this will be a welcome step forward , given that @entity154 practices are currently under unprecedented strain from rising patient demand and falling resources			0
' the implementation of this programme will be key			0
for it to work properly , there will need to be additional resources to enable enough pharmacists to be placed in @entity154 surgeries			0
' a further limiting factor at present is that many gp practices are struggling because their buildings are inadequate or do n't have space to expand staffing			0

pharmacists could be stationed in gp surgeries to help treat patients
those with long - term conditions like asthma and diabetes could *benefit*
there is currently a shortage of @entity28 but an oversupply of pharmacists
experts say the move would cut patient waiting times for appointments
