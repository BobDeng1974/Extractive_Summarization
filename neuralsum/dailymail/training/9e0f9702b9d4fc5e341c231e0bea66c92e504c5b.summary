if anyone tells you that international football is in decline and dying a slow death it would be worth showing them this video below			1
euphoria : @entity10 players celebrated wildly in the changing room after beating @entity12 in the @entity13 dance : @entity15 ( centre ) jumps around in celebration in the changing room after the match in @entity19 that 's @entity15 you can see skipping - and skipping really is the only word for it - around the dressing room as @entity10 players celebrate after beating @entity12 in the @entity13			1
the song they are singing is their fans ' anthem , ' @entity19 , decirme que sientes ? / @entity19 tell me how it feels ? ' this is it how it feels to be a successful national team , something an entire generation of @entity37 players know nothing about			1
when was the last tournament match involving @entity37 that could have merited such a celebration ? possibly in @entity42 , when @entity43 were beaten 4 - 2 and @entity37 went into a quarter final full of confidence			1
that means anyone 20 or under has only fuzzy memories of an @entity37 side inspiring the nation			1
so that includes @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 ; @entity54 may have a distant memory of those times ; @entity57 and @entity58 could probably recall it ; only @entity60 has actually played in a team that made the country feel good about itself , albeit briefly			1
all as one : @entity37 celebrate as a team after @entity57 's opening goal in the 2 - 0 win over @entity68 double trouble : @entity57 slots home his , and @entity37 's , second goal as they saw off @entity68 @entity72 : @entity10 players celebrate after @entity75 's goal against @entity12 in the @entity13 quarter - final celebration : @entity75 runs off in joy after his goal against @entity12 in the @entity13 quarter - final to reach back to times when @entity82 players surprised the nation by captivating them this current team would have to ask coach @entity85 to tell them his war stories from @entity88 or quiz celebrities such as @entity90 , only known to them as tv presenters , about @entity92			1
and that is why monday night 's 2 - 0 win in @entity95 was so important			1
it 's not going to prompt celebrations to match @entity10 's , nor should it			1
there wo n't be a bus - top parade around @entity101 just yet			0
but perhaps we caught a glimpse of something on and off the pitch			0
it was there in the sight of @entity109 leaping into the arms of @entity58 at the end and in the way the team all went over to applaud the travelling fans after the match			0
perhaps it was even present in the way in which the team embraced , arms round shoulders , for the national anthem			0
it is a a tantalising glimpse of a generation beginning to understand what a successful national team could look like ; more importantly what it could feel like			0
reminiscing : @entity37 players may need to ask @entity90 what it feels like to be adored by a nation success : @entity131 ( pictured ) was part of the @entity37 side who reached the semi-finals at @entity92 in front : @entity57 peels away after putting his country ahead in their first @entity139 qualifier in @entity95 the narrative about the decline of international football is a peculiarly @entity82 obsession			1
it 's not a debate flagged up in @entity147 , even after last summer 's @entity13 debacle ; nor in @entity149			2
and that video clip shows some of the best players in the world celebrating in a manner which suggests that international football may have an awful lot of life left in it yet			2
the reason why this debate has traction in @entity37 is that our national team has been so bad for so long whilst , at the same time , the @entity162 has become steadily better			0
it 's essentially an @entity164 - centric view of the world			0
but i would hazard a guess that winning with your national team surpasses anything you achieve with your club			0
perhaps it 's because the shared cultural background with your team - mates can make you seem a closer - knit group : the jokes , the songs , the reference points you all have in common can not be shared as easily in a multi-national dressing room			0
pointing the way : @entity37 coach @entity85 ( right ) can also talk of @entity37 's success at @entity88 adoration : @entity37 were embraced and loved by supporters for their successes during @entity88 bright spark : @entity51 ( pictured ) and @entity37 's youngsters must deliver on the international stage conversely , as the world becomes more global and diverse , national identities become even more important			1
but probably it is because no matter how well you do with @entity194 or @entity195 or @entity196 you will never experience the gratitude of an entire nation			0
young players in @entity149 , @entity147 and @entity200 know that from experience ; at another level , so do those from @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 and @entity12			2
@entity37 's will have to learn it from the history books			2
but they too should look at that video clip of @entity15 skipping around his dressing room singing			0
there ca n't be a much better feeling than that for a professional footballer			0
altogether now : @entity37 perform a huddle before kick - off , showing what it means to play for your country			2

@entity10 's players , including @entity15 , celebrated @entity13 quarter - final win over @entity12 by dancing in changing rooms
they were able to feel the love of a nation after doing well internationally
@entity37 's young stars have yet to experience that love from their nation
only @entity60 at @entity42 performed in a successful @entity37 side
current youngsters would need to ask @entity85 or @entity90 how it feels to be adored by your nation for international success
international football can still mean more to players than club success
@entity37 beat @entity68 2 - 0 away on monday in first qualifying match
@entity57 braces gave @entity37 good start to @entity139 qualifying
