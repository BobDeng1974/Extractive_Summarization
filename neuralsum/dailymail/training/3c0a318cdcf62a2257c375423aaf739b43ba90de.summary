by @entity0 published : 10:25 est , 21 january 2013 updated : 03:31 est , 22 january 2013 a group of pensioners have been banned from holding a singalong concert at their local community centre – unless they hire security			1
the event was organised by 78 - year - old @entity7 to raise funds to help save the threatened venue			1
she wanted a bar so some of the 100 - plus elderly guests could enjoy a sherry but was told by council officials that , if alcohol was involved , she would need two bouncers			1
the former caretaker , from @entity18 , @entity19 , said : ‘ i do n’t know what they think might happen in a room full of pensioners – it ’s ludicrous			0
' never had anything like this before ' : @entity27 , from the @entity18 and @entity29 @entity28 is amazed by the local council 's demand to charge organisers for two bouncers a pensioner event at @entity35 ‘ we just wanted to put on a nice night of singing			1
‘ some people like to have a drink at these things but there is certainly not going to be any binge - drinking going on			1
’ the decision has angered residents because @entity45 - on - @entity46 has pledged to support them in their attempts to take over local community halls			1
mrs @entity7 said booking @entity35 would cost £ 120 before paying an extra £ 100 for security – eating straight into any potential profit			1
she added : ‘ it is coming straight out of people ’s pockets and those security men will have the easiest shift ever			1
’ the council said it would make a final decision on the security guards after looking over profit and loss margins			1
@entity60 , 82 , said : ‘ it 's not about ticking boxes but making a sensible decision			0
a load of @entity65 in their 70s and 80s are hardly likely to go wild are they ? we just want to have fun like everyone else			0
‘ now it seems that some jobsworths are , as usual , spoiling the party			0
it 's such a shame that people do n't seem to have any common sense anymore			0
for health and safety : organisers have since cancelled the event , which was raising money for an under threat elderly day home , because they can not afford the ' ludicrous ' fee on top of a £ 120 hall booking fee @entity89 , 72 , said : ‘ they do n't have doormen or bouncers on the door at my local pub when my son takes me on thursday afternoons and they have a bar there			1
‘ why does the community centre need one ? it does n't make any sense to me			1
’ @entity27 , 55 , who is secretary of @entity18 and @entity29 @entity28 , said : ‘ if they were organising drunken booze - ups then i could understand but not with fund - raising events like this one			2
‘ i think the council needs to consider every event on merit and it is hard to fathom why they have to pay extra for security			1
‘ the bar staff are already city council employees			0
i 'm sure if there was a problem they would be capable of calling the police			0
we have never had anything like that happen before			0
’ @entity116 , the council 's resident director of services , said that he and councillor @entity119 would make a final decision on the security guards after looking over the profit and loss margin in the coming months and a council spokesman confirmed it was investigating the matter			2
mr @entity116 said : ‘ i think the additional cost is going to deter people from booking the venue			2
it is almost double what it will cost for the hall and they are out - pricing themselves			1
’ speaking about the closures , he said : ‘ we need to establish whether community halls are going to be financially sustainable for the future			2
‘ in times of financial hardship , the funding that we have as a city council will mean we have to go through some very difficult decisions			0
’ yesterday other party - going pensioners who were expected to attend the bash reacted with shock to the ruling			2
@entity149 , 82 , from @entity150 , said : ' they might have needed the bouncers if i was going out 60 years ago , but not any more			2
we 're not really the rowdiest of bunches			0
. ' most of the girl 's will just sit there knitting , no doubt			0
either that or a crossword			0
' the only thing i might need a bouncer for is helping me up when my dodgy knees go at the end of the night			0
' her husband @entity164 , 84 , a retired delivery driver , added : ' i ca n't imagine it is ever going to kick off there really			0
' why on earth do they require doormen for a little fund - raiser at a community centre			1
' what do they think we are going to get up to ? our days of round - the - clock parties are long gone			2

organisers were *hoping* to raise money for a elderly day home under threat
they say they can not afford to pay for security as well as a £ 120 booking fee
@entity45 - on - @entity46 ruled that security was needed for health and safety
the community hall is one of 10 across the region under threat of closure
