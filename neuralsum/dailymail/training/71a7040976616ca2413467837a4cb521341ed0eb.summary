by @entity0 it 's all they 're talking about down @entity4 's local pub - just who is the notorious great train robber in their midst ? but two days on , and still no - one in the @entity10 village has let slip the name of the high - flying executive who avoided paying almost £ 43,000 in train tickets for his daily commute into @entity15			1
' i 've lived here 30 years and i 've never heard anything like it , ' said @entity19 , 78			0
' it 's hot gossip at the moment			0
' she 's not the only one eager to find out who the mysterious the fare - dodging hedge fund manager is			1
rural : the hedge fund manager , who dodged £ 43,000 in rail fares over five years , began his journey into @entity15 at @entity4 train station in @entity10 , which has no ticket barriers a hairdresser , who did not want to be named , said : ' i 've had lots of clients talking about it			1
no one knows who it is			0
i know a few hedge fund managers around here but i could n't possibly disclose their names			2
' on sunday it was revealed that over five years , the hedge fund manager dodged the £ 24.50 - each - way fare while travelling from his home in the sought - after village to his place of work in the city			1
the unnamed man , who is believed to be the biggest fare dodger in history , exploited a loophole that allowed him to pay only a third of the actual cost of his 1hour 22minute journey			2
in the nearby village of @entity59 , a waitress told @entity60 that @entity62 trains should have been ' more on the ball '			0
' it serves them right , ' she said			0
' how did he get away with it for five years ? it puts the rail system to shame			0
' he caught the commuter train from @entity4 - a rural station with no barriers or ticket machine and only a part - time ticket office - without purchasing a fare			2
free pass : he would arrive at @entity79 station and transfer to another platform , for a service to @entity82 , while avoiding the barriers final destination : he would reach @entity82 in @entity15 , only paying £ 7.20 - a third of the rail fare once in @entity15 , the executive was then able to pass through the barriers at @entity82 by simply ' tapping out ' with an @entity88 paying just £ 7.20			1
but his scam was finally exposed by a ticket inspector and , in an out - of - court settlement , he paid @entity62 trains back the £ 42,550 in dodged fares and £ 450 legal cost within three days			1
the cost of a standard - class single fare from @entity4 - where the average home cost half a million pounds - to @entity15 is £ 24.50 while an annual season ticket costs £ 4,548			1
cheating the system : the unnamed commuter would only ' tap out ' his oyster card once on his journey according to a report in the @entity105 , the senior executive is believed to have travelled into @entity15 without buying any ticket and avoiding detection from 2008 until the end of last year			1
he was able to get off his train at @entity79 and cross a platform to catch a service to @entity82 - again avoiding having to go through any barriers			1
at @entity82 , he used an oyster card to exit the barriers , paying the then maximum £ 7.20 fare incurred when a passenger taps out without having tapped in			1
but on november 25 last year a ticket inspector standing next to the barriers spotted he had paid £ 7.20 and not the £ 2.30 for a single ticket			1
after being challenged , the passenger later admitted to dodging the correct fare on five journeys between @entity79 and @entity82			1
however , suspicious investigators for @entity62 discovered that the man had for a number of years up until 2008 been purchasing an annual ticket from @entity4			2
and within five days of being caught out at @entity82 , the executive renewed his season ticket , leading @entity62 to believe he had been dodging the fare for his commute for five years			2
despite never admitting to this , the executive offered to settle the matter out of court and paid up within three days of being notified by the train operator the total owed in dodged tickets			2
@entity62 , who has not named the man , said all passengers have the option to avoid prosecution and settle out of court			0
the train company told the @entity105 that the executive wanted to protect his identity because he was concerned about the impact it would have on his job			0
a spokesperson added : ' all customers have the option to settle out of court and in this case he chose to pay the settlement fee that we put to him			0
' the customer wanted to protect his identity and did not admit to evading fares for five years at any point during the process			0
' however , crtiics have questioned why the fare dodging executive was allowed to escape being prosecuted and remain anonymous			0
@entity162 , leader of the @entity164 rail union , said in the report : ' it is not only extraordinary that the biggest fare dodger in railway history got away with it for so long , but has also now escaped criminal prosecution as well			0
' do you know the fare dodger ? contact the @entity174 news desk at editorial@mailonline.co.uk			0
