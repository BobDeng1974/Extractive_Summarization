but fewer than four per cent of eligible parents in three underprivileged areas took up the £ 100 vouchers			2
the @entity48 scheme offered mothers and fathers in @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 in @entity54 , and @entity55 in @entity57 vouchers to spend on classes covering discipline , diet and exercise , bullying and preparing children for school			1
miss @entity17 ’s document suggests the @entity8 now want to go far further to make parents sign up , by making receipt of benefits conditional on co-operation with training by charities and experts			1

education secretary @entity83 wants to dock child benefit from almost 20,000 parents a year whose children play truant from school			1

there were 41,224 penalty notices for non-attendance at school issued in 2011/12 – the latest figures available – of which only 22,043 were paid within the time limit of 28 days			0

ministers argue there is a problem with the enforcement of the current rules			0
currently , £ 1.3million a year is raised from truancy fines			0
but almost half the total issued since 2004 went unpaid			0
between 2004/05 and 2011/12 , there were 168,958 fines , yet only 86,787 were paid before the penalty notice lapsed			0
if fines are not paid within 42 days , the fine lapses and the only recourse for local authorities is to pursue prosecution			0

the document miss @entity17 was carrying into @entity132 also set out the government ’s commitment to offer ‘ tax free childcare ’ , with a subsidy of up to £ 2,000 a year per child for working parents			2
