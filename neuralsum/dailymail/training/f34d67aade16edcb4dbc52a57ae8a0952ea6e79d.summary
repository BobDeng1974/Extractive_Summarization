in many ways the current @entity0 has been highly successful			1
it has begun the long process of restoring sound money , made major reforms to a number of public services and managed to begin restructuring the bloated @entity8			1
unfortunately , this is not reflected in the opinion polls			1
between them , the ( small ‘ c ’ ) conservative parties have nearly 50 per cent , while the two major forces of the @entity14 are on 42.5 per cent			1
thus the split in the @entity28 family – demonstrated by @entity30 ’s defection last month – makes it difficult for the @entity31 to win an election , potentially paving the way for @entity35 to win despite having little more than one - third of the vote			1
the obvious answer is for the @entity38 and @entity24 to do a pre-election deal			1
in a first - past - the - post system there is no prospect of doing a @entity44 pact ; each party takes too many of its voters from the same pool so there would not be enough combined mps to form a coalition			1
now there are obstacles in the way of a pre-election pact , but these are more emotional than rational			1
it is said that the two leaders do not like each other , but @entity31 has shown that ministers from separate parties can work effectively with each other , and there is no obvious personal animosity between @entity63 and @entity17 or @entity64 and @entity65			2
it is in the nature of politics that leaders attack each other , but that ought not unduly to upset a thick - skinned statesman			1
bombshell : the defection of @entity75 mp @entity30 ( right ) has sent ripples through @entity38 despite being held back by @entity31 , the prime minister has still delivered some important @entity79 gains			2
he vetoed the fiscal compact , voted against mr @entity81 , managed to cut the @entity83 budget and enshrined in law a referendum lock on future treaties			2
against this he is idiosyncratically supporting the @entity88 , which is a notable aspect of the creation of a federal @entity91			2
nonetheless , this leaves the balance in his favour even if he seems sometimes to have responded to pressure			2
battling the @entity83 : @entity63 is at loggerheads with @entity97 such as @entity99 's @entity98 what is certain is that his promise of an in / out referendum if returned in 2015 is sincere and can only happen if he wins			1
this means that @entity24 can achieve its main policy objective only if the @entity38 win the election – yet it is the principal obstacle to this happening			2
sheer bloody mindedness is stopping the conservative family from dominating the @entity112 political scene to achieve what all of us want			2
regrettably , the @entity75 by - election will make it worse , as positions become more entrenched			1
therefore , some people have started suggesting that nothing can be done until after an election at which point there will be some re-alignment of the @entity124			2
this seems a defeatist view			2
@entity63 has the opportunity to solve the problem now if he is generous			0
the undoubted talents and charisma of @entity18 should be recognised			1
he appeals to not only traditional conservative members but also to those who have felt disenfranchised , people who feel that politicians are part of a too - cosy establishment while @entity24 is shaking it up			1
in some respects he appeals in a way that @entity138 does to those with conservative values who are not necessarily @entity28			0
prior to the election such an offer needs to help @entity24 in its ambition to win parliamentary seats			0
this could start with the @entity147 where , in spite of its recent electoral success , no new @entity24 peer has been created			0
it needs to be followed by deals in individual seats			0
there are a number vacant because of retirement , which may be suitable , as well as the ones where the @entity28 can not expect to win and where @entity24 is making inroads against @entity159			0
after the election , if this strategy were adopted , there would be four @entity164 posts available through the removal of the @entity166			0
@entity168 appeal : @entity169 mayor @entity138 appears to have a lure for those who have never voted @entity28 @entity18 would be a much preferable deputy prime minister to any true conservative than @entity17 , while replacing @entity172 with someone from @entity24 would have a pleasant irony			1
perhaps as a sign of good faith even the @entity175 could be a @entity24 mp			1
@entity178 : @entity18 has undoubtable talents , writes @entity28 mp @entity19 today if the prime minister were to do this he would suddenly have taken charge of events , no longer could his critics say – as sir @entity185 said of @entity186 – that he ‘ did it all by halves ’			1
he would have gone further than he needed to go , rather than leaving the impression of being pushed unwillingly into something , and it would provide the launch pad for a general election			0
in the current atmosphere where politicians are so distrusted , it would act as a guarantee of how a future @entity28 government would be run because it would be beholden to a second party			0
the promise of a referendum would clearly be of an unbreakable nature in coalition with @entity24 , while the tone of the @entity83 renegotiation would be considerably stronger			0
it would have to be taken more seriously within the @entity83 if a party that wanted to leave were in the government			0
it would also be a recognition that all political parties are coalitions covering a range of views			0
historically , one of the strengths of the @entity28 has been its ability to stretch from @entity217 to @entity218 in so civilized a way that @entity218 supported @entity217 ’s leadership ambitions			0
narrowing the base with a third of potential supporters in another similar party is a sure way to defeat			0
@entity226 , courage and sense pave the path to victory			0
sadly , i doubt this will be done in time , so i am looking forward to some fair weather in @entity75 for a spot of canvassing against a respected erstwhile colleague			0
it is the district in which my wife grew up , so it could be something of a family outing to join fellow conservatives opposing someone with whom they agree on most policy issues .			0
