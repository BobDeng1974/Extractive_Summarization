when word of the interview got out , the government said it would be speaking to mr @entity15 when he returned to the capital , @entity31			1
' mr @entity15 has broken the law by not seeking permission from the communication ministry to film , broadcast or conduct media related events on @entity9 , ' said mr @entity47 , joint secretary of @entity4 's tourism @entity48			1
