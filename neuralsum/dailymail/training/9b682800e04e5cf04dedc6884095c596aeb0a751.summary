by @entity0 last updated at 4:48 pm on 25th august 2011 those staying in @entity1 for the bank holiday - so - called ' staycationers ' - will have to brace themselves for nightmare journeys as some 16 million vehicles are expected to hit the roads			1
a number of festivals - including the @entity9 in @entity10 - and sporting events have been scheduled to take place over the @entity13 weekend , but those venturing out on the roads can expect major snarl - ups			1
in addition , those planning on using the @entity18 may also be left frustrated , as the @entity21 drivers are threatening to strike over the weekend , meaning that services between @entity23 and @entity24 could be jeopardised			1
@entity25 : this group of girls are all smiles , despite reaching the @entity30 site only to find cascades of water prepared for the worst : more festival - goers enter the muddy grounds at @entity30 , where water has been pumped from the site over the past week further , the @entity36 have warned brits to expect inclement conditions - showers are forecast and temperatures will be cold across the country			1
drivers will find that a number of roadworks on @entity45 's motorways and major trunk roads will have been completed by the start of the getaway , with others being suspended over the holiday			2

standing traffic : with some 16 million vehicles expected on the road this @entity13 weekend , journeys could be frustratingly slow ( left ) and @entity18 drivers are threatening to strike during the bank holiday weekend over a pay dispute ( right ) as thousands of @entity72 - clad revellers trudged their way into the grounds at @entity30 today , and with further rain expected , organiser @entity69 revealed that workers have been draining the site			1
he said : ' we 've worked night and day since [ last week ] to pump water off the ground , to pump water out of the ditches because we know we are getting more , so we needed to get as much off the ground as possible so that it 's got somewhere to go			1
' up to 100,000 people were expected to attend the event which will be headlined by bands including @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90			2
rainy day : heavy showers and cold temperatures are expected over the bank holiday weekend , though by monday there is a chance most of the country will be dry			1
meanwhile , to accommodate track works , there will be 3,428 buses laid on over the weekend friday : heavy rain is predicted across the country , and thunderstorms will punctuated the day			1
while there will be some sunshine , temperatures are not expected to rise above the late teens - 16 or 17 degrees @entity107			1

@entity120 provided to @entity121 by the @entity122 with so many cars on the road drivers have been warned to take extra care after a survey showed 71 per cent of motorists have lost concentration at the wheel in the last year			1
the poll by road safety charity @entity131 and insurance company @entity133 found this was caused by worries about work , tension at home or inconsiderate road users			0
further , motorists are being warned about huge tailbacks tomorrow behind by a convoy of steam engines travelling towards the coast - at 5mph			1
the 86ft long convoy , weighing more than 75 tonnes , will travel from @entity146 to @entity147 to take part in a rally next week			1
but the 115 - mile journey will take an estimated 30 hours to complete and cause huge tailbacks for tourists heading for the south coast			1
motorists are being warned of major delays on the @entity156 and @entity157 in @entity146 , @entity158 in @entity159 , @entity160 in @entity161 and @entity162 in @entity147			0
a spokesman for @entity164 warned motorists to allow extra time for journeys and said : ' due to the size of this " road train " it will be extremely slow moving and as it is travelling over a @entity13 it will have the potential to create congestion			1
' the estimated speed of this convoy will be 5 miles per hour			2
' wherever possible disruption will be kept to a minimum but hauliers and motorists are asked to please be patient if they come across this load			0
' on the move ? @entity182 is expecting more than 852,000 passengers to journey through the airport over the weekend meanwhile @entity21 workers with the @entity188 shuttle train company @entity18 are threatening a strike from tomorrow , having demanded an 8 per cent pay rise			1
@entity18 has suspended bookings for the @entity24 to @entity23 crossing on saturday , sunday and bank holiday monday to safeguard journeys for those who have already booked			1
the company said it still hoped to run a full service and its @entity1 staff were not involved in the dispute			1
over 25,500 vehicles - and 100,000 people - are scheduled to travel on the service from @entity21 to @entity45 during the three - day weekend			1
and between 12,000 and 15,000 travellers are expected to journey the other way , escaping to @entity206 for some bank holiday sunshine			2

there will be 3,428 replacement buses running over the holiday weekend , compared with 3,339 last august bank holiday			1

travel organisation @entity227 said around 1.8 million @entity1 would be heading abroad from friday to bank holiday monday - roughly the same number as travelled overseas this time last year			1
' this will be one of the busiest weekends of the year with most passengers on friday , ' said a spokesman for @entity236			0
' some people will be going for city breaks over the bank holiday , while others will be taking the chance for some sun before the kids go back to school			0

for those staying at home , the weather picture is mostly doom and gloom , according to forecaster @entity288 of the @entity122			1
she told @entity121 : ' on friday it looks as though it will be a showery day across the country			0
there will be some heavy and thundery showers , almost anywhere			2
' the heaviest of the rain is likely to be across the eastern side of @entity45			0
while there will be a bit of sunshine in between there will be predominantly heavy downpours and persistent rain			0
' temperatures will not be brilliant for the time of year , to be honest : they are expected to be in the high teens , so for most places they will be between 17 and 19 degrees @entity107			2
that is very low for the time of year			0
' jam - packed : some two million people are expected at @entity9 this bank holiday weekend party time : revellers dress up for the @entity9 , which began in 1964 in @entity10 music man : @entity313 plays one of his famous @entity313 sets at the carnival , but will the weather be as sunny this year ? however , mrs @entity288 believes that the weather will slowly improve of the course of the weekend			1
she continued : ' we will still see some showers on saturday , and it will be a breezy day , but there will be a mixture of sunshine and showers across the whole of the country			0
' some of those showers are likely to be heavy , particularly in the east and north			0
temperatures will again be in the high teens - we might just get up to 20 degrees in the south			2
' as we go in to sunday and monday i think we will see things improve a little bit more			0
sunday 's showers will be much lighter			2
temperatures could get up to 21 degrees @entity107 , especially in the south			0
' the further north you go , the windier it is likely to be , and there is also the risk of rain from time to time			0
in fact there will be something of a north - south divide , in terms of the weather			2
' sunday is also the biggest day of the @entity9 , and while 40 people have been arrested by police on suspicion of planning riots at the festival , up to two million revellers are expected			1
the carnival has been going since 1964 and is thought to be the second most popular street festival behind the @entity358 in @entity359 , and with luck the weather might be kind			2
mrs @entity288 said : ' there is a small chance that there will be showers , and it will be breezy			0
but it should be a bright day with sunny spells			0
temperatures should get up to 21 degrees			0
it is a favourable part of the country			0
' and on monday that slow improvement will continue and for most of the country it should be a bright day with sunny spells , and the winds should ease			0
' it will never be particularly warm over the weekend , and it will be very showery , but it will improve by monday			0
' in @entity251 , however , particularly on saturday and sunday , there will be fairly unseasonable weather with very heavy rain and strong winds			0
the further north you go , the worse the weather will be			0
