' i do n't see it as flattery , ' he said , ' i actually see it as theft			0
' sir @entity32 said seeing knockoff designs made him think of the lengthy development cycle that went into producing the originals			0
he said : ' when you 're doing something for the first time , for example with the phone , and you do n't know it 's going to work , and you spend seven or eight years working on something , and then it 's copied — i have to be honest , the first thing i think is n't " ooh , that was flattering "			2
' all those weekends i could have had at home with my lovely family but did n't , but the flattery made up for it			0
