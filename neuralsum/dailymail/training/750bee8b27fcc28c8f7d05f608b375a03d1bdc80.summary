ancient warriors armed with swords and spears from 3,000 years ago suffered from shell shock just like modern soldiers , according to a study			1
soldiers who experienced the horrors of the battlefield and were left with post traumatic stress disorder is not a phenomenon of modern warfare , say the researchers			1
an analysis of ancient texts shows @entity15 became common considerably earlier than previously believed , although the symptoms were explained away as ' the spirits of those enemies whom the patient had killed			1
' @entity21 researchers have found signs of @entity15 up to 3,000 years ago			1
they say soldiers experiencing horrors of the battlefield ( stock image shown ) is not just a phenomenon of modern warfare			1
the earliest reference had been from the @entity30 , @entity31			1
pictured is a @entity33 decorated with @entity35 warriors the earliest reference had been from the @entity36 but scientists traced mention of ' shell shock ' back to 1,300 bc in ancient @entity40 the study , published in @entity42 and @entity43 , said that while modern technology has increased the effectiveness and types of weaponry , ' ancient soldiers facing the risk of injury and death must have been just as terrified of hardened and sharpened swords , showers of sling - stones or iron - hardened tips of arrows and fire arrows			1
' ' the risk of death and the witnessing of the death of fellow soldiers appears to have been a major source of psychological trauma , ' the researchers from @entity59 and @entity60 wrote			2
' moreover , the chance of death from injuries , which can nowadays be surgically treated , must have been much greater in those days			0
' all these factors contributed to post traumatic or other psychiatric stress disorders resulting from the experience on the ancient battlefield			0
' previously , the first documented instance of @entity15 was @entity78 historian @entity77 ' account of an @entity80 spearman called @entity81 who lost his sight against the @entity84 in @entity85 at the @entity30 and whose ' psychogenic mutism ' followed			1
but it now appears much earlier traumas were suffered in @entity40 , now @entity89 , during the @entity90 between 1300 and 609 bc. post-traumatic stress disorder ( @entity15 ) is an anxiety caused by very stressful or frightening events			2
they may include military combat , terrorist attacks , assault , natural disasters , road accidents or witnessing violent deaths			0
@entity15 can develop immediately after a disturbing event , or can emerge months or years later			1
it 's thought that one in three people who have a traumatic experience are affected by @entity15 , @entity102 say			2
sufferers often relive the event through nightmares or flashbacks and can feel isolated , frightened or guilty			0
symptoms , including difficulty sleeping , can be persistent and severe enough to impact on a person 's day - to - day life			0
@entity15 is currently treated with cognitive behavioural therapy ( @entity113 ) or eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing ( @entity117 ) as well as antidepressant medication			2
the study said that while modern technology has increased the effectiveness and types of weaponry , ' ancient soldiers facing the risk of injury and death must have been just as terrified of hardened and sharpened swords			2
' shown is a stock image of a @entity131 servicemen returning home from @entity89 in 2006 writings uncovered from the time mention the @entity134 of @entity136 's ' mind changed ' , meaning he became disturbed			0
the researchers argue he may have been suffering from ptsd			0
@entity138 was also suffered by soldiers , with the male population of @entity141 called upon to fight in battles in every third year during their military service , also possibly the cause of post traumatic stress disorders			0
but the researchers said people would have found it difficult to diagnose these traumas and to treat sufferers accordingly due to a lack of understanding			2
clinical psychologist professor @entity153 , of @entity60 , @entity154 , said : ' for many years it has often been stated the first documented evidence of post traumatic symptoms dates back to the @entity30 , as chronicled by the historian @entity77			1
' this paper , and the research on which it is based , demonstrates post traumatic psychological symptoms of battle were evident in ancient @entity40			0
. ' well before the @entity78 and @entity171 eras , before the time of @entity164 and the biblical kings , @entity166 and @entity167 , and contemporarily with the time of the @entity169			0
there really is nothing new under the sun. ' especially significant is this evidence comes from the area known as the cradle of civilisation and , of course , the site of much recent conflict including the recent @entity182 and @entity183 in which many @entity21 service personnel were involved			0

@entity21 researchers have found signs of @entity15 up to 3,000 years ago
