@entity0 could return to @entity2 action next weekend after the hamstring injury that forced him to withdraw from @entity5 's squad was found to be less serious than first feared			1
the @entity7 defender will not play any part in @entity5 's @entity10 qualifier against @entity11 on saturday or next week 's international friendly against @entity13 after picking up the injury during training on friday			1
however , the @entity7 have confirmed that the 29 - year - old is expected to be back against @entity17 on saturday 22 november			0
videos scroll down to watch @entity0 ( @entity19 ) picked up a hamstring strain during training with @entity5 on friday @entity0 speaks with @entity5 manager @entity22 ( c ) and @entity7 teammate @entity23 ( r ) a statement of the @entity7 official website said : ' @entity0 could be in contention to face @entity17 next weekend after scans revealed the full - back 's hamstring injury is not as serious as first feared			1
' he returned to @entity30 for an assessment which has since showed that he has sustained a ' grade one ' hamstring injury â€“ the least significant on the scale of such injuries			0
' @entity0 will continue to be monitored by @entity7 's medical team and , although he remains a doubt for next saturday , he has not yet been ruled out of the game against @entity38 's @entity17			2
' @entity41 full - back @entity39 will replace @entity0 for the @entity10 qualifier against @entity11 @entity41 left - back @entity39 is the only option to replace @entity0 as manager @entity22 did not name @entity46 's @entity45 in his squad listed with @entity48 by the deadline on friday			1
@entity22 said : ' @entity39 is the one to come in as unfortunately we had given our squad at 11 o'clock as we are duty - bound to do to @entity48 and , because there were three left backs , i left him [ @entity45 ] out of the 23 as we had 24 players at the time			2
as it turns out now we ca n't use him			0
' the @entity5 manager conceded that he was aware of the rule , but had hoped @entity48 would show some leniency by allowing him to call up @entity45 as @entity0 ' injury occurred within half an hour of the squad list being submitted			1
@entity17 defender @entity45 was not included in @entity22 's original 23 - man squad to face @entity11 @entity22 had hoped that @entity48 would show some flexibility by allowing him to call up @entity45 he said : ' i ca n't pretend that i think it 's a great idea that you have to name 23 players almost 36 hours before the game because training injuries do occur and people do get injuries and fall sick			1
' i would like to think that if you are allowed to have 23 players in your squad that you should at least have the right [ to ] a little bit longer than 36 hours ahead of the game			0
' having said that , i did know about the rule			0
my hope was that because we were only 25 minutes late when we applied to bring @entity45 back into the squad that maybe @entity48 would look at that and say , ' it 's a reasonable request and we can show some flexibility , ' but they decided that was n't possible , that the rule is the rule , and that 11 o'clock is the deadline and because the injury occurred 25 minutes past 11 we missed it			2
