this is the vision of @entity6 , a @entity7 company , which has embarked on a radical experiment to grow a miniature house from fungus			1
founded in 2007 by classmates @entity12 and @entity13 from the @entity14 , @entity6 makes use of a part of the mushroom known as ‘ mycelium ’ to grow sustainable products			1
ecologically , mycelium 's function is to break down waste			0
as it does this it secrets various products including enzymes , lipids , proteins , which act as glue and hold things together @entity37 is the unseen part of a mushroom which consists of millions of tiny fibres			1
‘ @entity13 made the observation while he was taking a stroll in the woods , that fungal mycelium was growing on the wood chips and holding them together , ’ @entity41 told @entity42			2
‘ the thought process was — can we use mycelium as growing glue ? ’ ecologically , mycelium ’s function is to break down waste			2
as it does this it secrets various products including enzymes , lipids , proteins , which act as glue and hold things together			0
@entity6 built the tiny home structure from pine wood and poured the fungal mix inside the wall mould , where it was left to grow			1
this dried over the next month , in similar way to how concrete cures , leaving it with an airtight seal founder @entity12 said that the fungal flat is self - repairing - if a tree fell on the house , the wall would have to be rebuilt , but the insulation would grow back			1
the same fungal material can also be used to make other household items such as wine cradles ( pictured ) @entity6 was founded in 2007 by classmates @entity12 and @entity13 from the @entity14 in @entity80 @entity6 built the tiny home structure from pine wood and poured the fungal mix inside the wall mould , where it was left to grow			1
this dried over the next month , in similar way to how concrete cures , leaving it with an airtight seal			0
the company claims it saves on material costs , as it does n’t require any studs in the wall , and it gives high thermal performance since it provides one continuous insulated wall assembly			0
@entity41 told @entity42 that the fungal flat is self - repairing - if a tree fell on the house , the wall would have to be rebuilt , but the insulation would grow back			1
it also has its own ‘ immune system ’ which prevents microorganisms from starting colonies within			2
@entity41 and his team now hope to scale - up the process to meet growing interest in the home			0
the group has been selling it for a few years as protective packaging , helping big companies replace thousands of @entity111 , and other plastic foam packaging parts			0
@entity6 is also experimenting with a variety of other ideas , including marine buoys , car bumpers and shoe soles .			0

@entity7 firm @entity6 uses mycelium - the *vegetative* part of a fungus - to grow structure of the house
@entity37 is made up of millions of tiny fibres and used as ' growing glue '
the ' fungal flat ' claims to be self - repairing and has its own immune system
