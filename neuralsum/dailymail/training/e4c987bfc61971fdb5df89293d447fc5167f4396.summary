when one is the monarch , one is used to being given a comfy seat in the front row			0
but yesterday the @entity3 found herself perched several rows back as she watched the @entity6 swimming heats			0
she was given an ordinary plastic seat and then found her view obscured by a woman in a rather large hat			2
the offending spectator was her own lady - in - waiting , the @entity12 , who made matters worse by having chosen a very similar shade of green in which to dress			1
after a while , she appeared to be giving up trying to get a better angle , right @entity17 spent most of her afternoon trying to improve her view - which was somewhat obscured by her lady - in - waiting 's enormous green hat			1
as the swimming races got off to an exciting start below , she could be seen craning her neck to try and get a better view over mrs @entity26			2
the @entity3 began to look dejected as she dodged around her lady - in - waiting to catch a glimpse of the heats of the men 's 50m and women 's 100m butterfly			1
at one point , she even appeared to sit back in exasperation , as fellow spectators around her got heavily involved in the races			0
smiles at first : @entity50 speaks to the @entity3 as she takes her place at the the @entity52 swimming in @entity53 the view was made difficult by her lady - in - waiting @entity55 , who was wearing a similar - but slightly clashing - green ensemble to the @entity3 the pictures were a far cry from the @entity3 's expressions as she watched the hockey earlier that day			1
during that game , she had been seen laughing and joking with fellow spectators and getting wrapped up in the drama of the game			0
but it seemed the @entity3 was too polite to ask her lady - in - waiting to move - and instead spent her time dodging around @entity50 as she moved position			1
@entity50 , 71 , had already risked royal disapproval by wearing a green ensemble similar to the @entity3 - which actually appeared to clash			1
meanwhile , the @entity3 wore a green crepe coat by @entity71 , a floral silk dress and a blue hat with green trim by @entity75			2
she also sported a thistle brooch , one of a set of four pins gifted to her by the @entity80			0
the @entity3 looked fed up as she failed to see down to the pool and get involved in the excitement of the races at one point , as everyone looked animated around her , the @entity3 appeared to look exasperated with her lack of view			0
she was there to watch the men 's 50m and women 's 100m butterfly heats @entity50 has been on the royal lady - in - waiting circuit for some time , having been the temporary lady - in - waiting to @entity95 the princess margaret , countess of snowdon between 1971 and 1975			1
she was then an extra lady - in - waiting to @entity95 the princess margaret , countess of snowdon between 1975 and 1992 before becoming a lieutenant of @entity97 ( @entity97 ) in 1986			1
she was again lady - in - waiting to @entity95 the princess margaret , countess of snowdon between 1992 and 2002 , before becoming lady - in - waiting to the queen			2
the @entity3 expectantly took her seat as a spectator at the @entity6 , but seemed to struggle settling into the plastic chair - something in which she is not particularly well - practised it was a far cry from pictures taken earlier in the day , in which the @entity3 seemed to be having a great time as she shared a joke with fellow spectators at the @entity108 versus @entity110 hockey game unobscured : @entity50 ( bottom right in light green ) was well out of her majesty 's eyeline in the hockey game earlier today the @entity3 shares a joke with the @entity117 in the stands as they watch the @entity108 v @entity110 game at the @entity121 her majesty appeared to follow the @entity108 hockey team 's struggles with fierce intensity in 2002 , she was invested as a commander of the @entity97 ( @entity97 ) before becoming a @entity97 ( @entity97 ) in 2014			1
at the swimming centre , the @entity3 was introduced to volunteers by @entity131 's first minister @entity130 and @entity132 2014 chief executive @entity129			0
aquatics competition manager @entity133 was left in stitches when @entity17 expressed her amazement at the swimmers			0
the 30 - year - old @entity137 , who sat next to the @entity3 , said : ' @entity17 did say something funny - " they swim quite fast , do n't they ? it 's very close "			2
i said " yes , yes , this is the nature of the sport "			0
' regal : the @entity3 seemed to be enjoying herself at the hockey match her majesty shares a joke with the @entity149 @entity148 as she visits the @entity121 busy day : once the @entity110 hockey game ( pictured ) had finished , @entity17 ( left ) moved across to the @entity151 glum : @entity153 , @entity153 and @entity154 , @entity155 watch the @entity156 compete in the @entity157 at the @entity158			1
she seemed disappointed with the silver obtained by sir @entity160 et al			0

after watching the hockey , the @entity3 moved on to watch the swimming
her majesty sat in stands at @entity151
but her view was somewhat obscured by her lady - in - waiting 's green hat
like the @entity17 , she also wore a *bright* - but clashing - green ensemble
the @entity3 craned her neck to see over the @entity27 @entity26
