@entity0 said the fear of falling victim to another @entity4 upset inspired his @entity6 team to a 4 - 1 victory over @entity8			1
@entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 all exited the competition over the weekend while @entity13 were held to a draw at @entity15			2
but @entity6 did not fall into the same trap as their rivals as goals from @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 were enough to see off @entity23 @entity8 on monday night			1
@entity19 fired home a stunning volley in the opening minutes to put @entity6 in front against @entity8 @entity22 squeezed a shot in from near the byline to add gloss to @entity6 's victory at @entity8 @entity0 did not want his side to be knocked out of the @entity4 by lower league opposition ' i mentioned what happened to the players over the weekend before the match			1
it would have been foolish not to , ' the @entity6 manager said			1
' i needed to make sure there was a real focus to us as a group			0
' there was a reason why the television cameras were here - people were hoping for an upset , but we did n't want to be a part of that			1
we did n't want it to happen			0
' @entity20 put @entity6 2 - 0 up just after the break , then @entity22 scored a stunning curler for the @entity54 ' third and @entity21 rounded the win off from close range after @entity57 's consolation goal for the hosts			1
but the best goal of the night was @entity6 's first , which was scored by their star player @entity19			1
the 24 - year - old , who has now scored five goals since his move from @entity64 , hammered a left - foot - volley past @entity66 from 22 yards after @entity67 had looped the ball clear from their own box			2
soon after the in - form forward hobbled off with a knee injury			2
@entity19 receives treatment after falling awkwardly on his knee as he raced through on the @entity8 goal @entity19 had to be replaced by @entity20 and the @entity75 was later seen leaving the ground on crutches @entity0 hopes the @entity75 , who has been a revelation for the @entity54 this term , is not out for a long time			1
' there is a concern there for us , ' @entity0 said			1
' we do n't know how bad it is			0
he has gone back home and we will check him in the morning			0
' he is due for a scan so hopefully he will be okay			0
' hopefully if the scan is clear he will be okay and it is just a short - term thing but at the moment it 's a concern for us			2
' @entity0 thoroughly enjoyed watching @entity19 's effort fly in from just outside the box			1
' it was an outstanding goal , ' the @entity91 said			0
' he showed his qualities once again and it will be disappointing if we lose him for any length of time , but if you do others have to step up to the mark			0
@entity20 doubled @entity6 's advantage in the second half to leave them firmly in the driving seat @entity57 fired home in the final minutes to score a consolation for @entity23 @entity8 @entity21 restored @entity6 's three - goal advantage on the stroke of full time ' @entity20 came in and showed a lot of quality tonight			1
he always looked likely to score and he did tonight			0
' if one door closes for one player , another opens			0
' @entity0 is relishing a trip to his former club @entity114 in the fifth round			1
' it will be good to go back , ' said @entity0 , who managed the @entity118 club for two years			2
' i have good memories of my time there and there are lots of people i know still there			0
' we will have a great following and it will be a real cup tie to look forward to			0
' @entity8 manager @entity128 could have been celebrating a victory had his team taken their chances in the first half			1
@entity67 cut open the @entity6 defence with ease , but @entity135 and @entity136 failed to score			2
@entity128 said : ' we tried to attack with intent and press the opposition but they are an excellent side			0
@entity8 manager @entity128 ( right ) was proud of his players despite the 4 - 1 defeat to @entity6 ' the game is marginal no matter where you stand in the pyramid			1
fair play to @entity6 , they were worthy winners in the end			2
' the @entity19 goal was a great piece of skill but it did n't frighten us			0
' the lads have done the club credit			0
we were undone by four @entity157 quality goals			0

@entity6 won their @entity4 fourth round match against @entity8 4 - 1
boss @entity0 said they feared becoming part of another upset
but the @entity6 manager said they used it to inspire them to victory
