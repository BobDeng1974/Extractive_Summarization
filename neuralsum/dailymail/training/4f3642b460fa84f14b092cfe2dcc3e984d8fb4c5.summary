rating : a chatty young man called @entity3 is blowing frantically on the embers of a failing fire			2
he breaks off to show us our ground floor room at this handsome ( grade 2 - listed ) pub on the @entity12 , across the tracks from @entity15 railway station			1
the author @entity16 lives 100 yards upstream , and @entity17 is a couple of miles further along the towpath in this leafy stretch of @entity22			2
simply glorious : the @entity23 enjoys a remarkable setting on the banks of the @entity12 we are only paying £ 100 @entity26 but , even so , it 's a dull room - a box , with brown furniture and dated curtains			1
its one redeeming feature is a little fenced - off patio leading directly on to the canal at the back of the building			1
there is no middle ground in the bathroom , where the basin taps either trickle lifelessly or gush with such force that they give you a proper soaking - just where you do n't want it			1
but what we like about the @entity23 is how it 's popular with locals , and the staff are all in the mould of @entity3 - welcoming , efficient , down to earth			1
we are particularly impressed by a @entity53 girl who tells us she has been in the @entity54 for 11 years - which explains her flawless @entity56			1
a friend who lives nearby joins us for dinner			0
@entity3 explains that there is no head chef as such - ' we 're using agency ones at the moment ' - and it shows			2
my game pie is an unsightly mess and does n't taste of much , while my wife has a rubbery steak			0
our friend does better with her venison			0
but prices ( wine is particularly reasonable ) are good for this part of the world			0
a labrador strolls in for some respite from the cold			0
he seems to like the atmosphere , and might even be impressed by the bar decorated in polished old penny pieces minted in 1967 and by the wonderful array of real ales , including @entity84 and @entity85			0
yes , the dining room needs some love			0
but what a spot this must be once winter is over , when @entity3 wo n't have to act as human bellows , and when sitting by the river will be a glorious summer treat			0
the @entity23 53 @entity94 @entity15 @entity95 @entity96 01488 658 263 @entity97 doubles from £ 100 , @entity26 rating :			1

the @entity23 is a @entity100 - listed pub on the @entity12 , in @entity95
the *restaurant* is popular with the locals - although the food is *uninspiring*
