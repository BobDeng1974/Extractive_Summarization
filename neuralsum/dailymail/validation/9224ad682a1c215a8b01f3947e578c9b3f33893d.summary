it all started as an innocent attempt to find clams , but left a small fox in a tense standoff with a 500lb brown bear			2
as the two animals faced one another on the tidal flats of the @entity10 in southern @entity11 , it seemed there would only be one inevitable ending			0
but miraculously after running round in circles chased by the bear , the red fox was left to return to its search in peace as it appeared the @entity11 brown bear just wanted someone to play with			1
a red fox appeared to be facing an inevitable ending when it was locked in a stand off with an approaching bear but it appeared the grizzly brown bear just wanted a playmate , and the fox and bear played a game of chase @entity34 photographer @entity33 was photographing the fox when he saw the large bear approach from nearby woods and head straight for the animal - a fraction of its size			1
the 32 - year - old , of @entity42 , @entity43 , said : ' the bear appeared from the forest , located about a mile away , and began to make a beeline straight towards us			0
' the bear walked straight past me at a very close distance and kept going towards the fox , and began to chase it			0
' the fox , however , easily outmanoeuvred the bear as it was chased in circles a couple of times , and when they stopped they both squared off about thirty feet apart			0
' the agile fox managed to dodge the bear and neither animal seemed aggressive , not running at full speed and despite the tense stand - off it soon became clear that the bear just wanted to play			1
the pair were seen running in circles , neither at full speed , with the agile fox deftly managing to stay out of harm 's way			2
' most likely the bear just wanted to chase the fox , and it 's as simple as that , ' added mr @entity33			0
' it was n't aggressive enough in its behaviour to be meaning to actually kill , it just really seemed to want a chase ! the fox had been calmly searching for clams on the tidal flats of the @entity10 in @entity11 but the red fox 's relative calm was soon disrupted when a grizzly brown bear made a direct beeline for it the 500lb bear was seen to approach from a nearby forest and head straight for the fox that was clamming both animals faced eachother , and at first it appeared there would only be one outcome for the small fox ' soon after i took the photographs the fox walked off in the other direction and continued clamming , the bear lay there for a few moments before slowly getting up and sauntering away			1
' the @entity11 brown bear is the name of any member of the grizzly bear family that lives in the coastal regions of southern @entity11			2
they are the second largest type of brown bear in the world , only after the giant bears of @entity112			0
as the bear approached the fox began running and the game of chase between the pair began the fox managed to dodge the bear and both were seen running in circles across the @entity11 salt flats photographer @entity33 said neither animal was aggressive and both seemed to be playing a game			1

@entity33 was photographing a red fox searching for claims in @entity11
a large brown bear *emerged* from a forest and made a beeline for the fox
the two appeared to be locked in a stand - off but played a game of chase
neither animal was at full speed and fox ran in circles to evade the bear
after a *short* time fox went back to its search and 500lb bear slunk off
