no one knew what had befallen the pair until an investigation , completed last year but only recently released , pieced together the final 31 minutes of the young men 's lives			2
hero : an investigation found that navy petty officer 2nd class @entity5 could have saved his own life , but exhausted his oxygen trying to free his fellow sailor trapped under water a series of difficulties : the odds were stacked against petty officer 1st class @entity7 on the day he and @entity5 embarked on a training exercise that would claim both their lives the investigation , conducted more than 16 months ago , was finally released last week to @entity35 under the @entity36			1
it appears the dive , a pre-deployment training exercise , was doomed from the beginning			0

@entity5 and @entity7 were connected to each other and the boat			0
@entity5 could have cut the cord connecting him to @entity7 and swim free , but he did n't			1
