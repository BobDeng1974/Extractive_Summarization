by @entity0 a narrow three - wheeled electric vehicle could offer commuters the freedom to squeeze through traffic jams as if were driving a motorbike , while offering the stability and safety of being inside a car			1
@entity11 's i - road personal mobility vehicle is designed for negotiating busy city streets and is no wider than a standard motorbike , but can be driven like a car thanks to intelligent front wheels that automatically adjust to suit the driver 's actions			1
the trike uses ' active lean ' technology that allows its wheels to move up and down to calculate the best position for going round tight corners , or weaving in and out of traffic			1
the i - road could be the answer for people who like the idea of cutting through traffic on a motorbike , but like the creature comforts of their car			1
it seats two people under cover , is ' intuitive ' to drive ' and there is no need for a helmet , according to the company			0
the @entity55 technology is the key to the vehicle 's stability , safety and comfort , @entity11 told @entity61 , as it offers a stable ride without the driver having to maintain the balance of the vehicle			1
the i - road could be the answer for people who like the idea of cutting through traffic on a motorbike , but like the creature comforts of their car			2
it seats two people under cover , is ' intuitive ' to drive ' and there is no need for a helmet , according to the company part of @entity11 's eco range , the i - road prototype is electric and has a range of 30 miles on a single charge the system uses a lean actuator and gearing mounted above the front suspension member , linked via a yoke to the left and right front wheels			1
an engine control unit calculates the required degree of lean based on steering angle , gyro - sensor and vehicle speed information , with the system automatically moving the wheels up and down in opposite directions , applying lean angle to counteract the centrifugal force of cornering			2
the system also operates when the vehicle is being driven in a straight line over stepped surfaces , the actuator automatically compensating for changes in the road to keep the body level			0
this means that if a driver tries to park the trike and rides up on a kerb , it will stay level			0
a spokesman told @entity61 that anyone who can drive a car can ' jump in and drive the i - road as there is nothing special to learn - you do n't have to know how to drive a motorbike ' part of @entity11 's eco range , the prototype is electric and has a range of 30 miles on a single charge , which may not be a long distance , but the company believes this type of vehicle could serve as the main mode of transport for short urban journeys in the future			1
the vehicle 's speed can be limited to suit road laws for its class of vehicles			0
it can typically travel at up to 45km per hour ( 28 mph ) but has a maximum speed of 60kph ( 37mph )			0
a spokesman told @entity61 that anyone who can drive a car can ' jump in and drive the i - road as there is nothing special to learn - you do n't have to know how to drive a motorbike ' as the leaning motion happens automatically and while the driver experiences a ' different sensation ' to driving a car , it is no different to operate			2
he also said that the driver and passengers so not ' heave to one side ' of the vehicle like when a car takes a corner a little too quickly			0
despite the vehicle being narrow , its smart , moveable wheels mean that drivers do not need to stabilise the vehicle when it is stationary - like motorcyclists putting their feet on the road surface at traffic lights			2
@entity11 believes its concept trike could play a role in reducing traffic jams and pollution in cities and is going to roll out its vehicles in @entity173 's @entity172 : mo urban transport system the system uses a lean actuator and gearing mounted above the front suspension member , linked via a yoke to the left and right front wheels			1
an engine control unit calculates the required degree of lean based on steering angle , gyro - sensor and vehicle speed information , with the system automatically moving the wheels up and down in opposite directions , applying lean angle to counteract the centrifugal force of cornering			2
the system also operates when the pmv is being driven in a straight line over stepped surfaces , the actuator automatically compensating for changes in the road to keep the body level			0
because of this , the vehicle has a closed body with creature comforts such as lighting , heating , audio and @entity204			0
@entity11 said : ' people using this kind of vehicle want something that is more comfortable , offers better weather protection and is safer than a two - wheeler such as a scooter or motorcycle , but has similar benefits of low running costs , easy parking and around - town manoeuvrability			0
' the i - road is 2.35 metres long , 1.45 metres high but just 85 centimetres wide - similar to a motorbike - which @entity11 said is handy for manoeuvring through congested traffic and allows four of the vehicles to be parked in a single parking bay			1
the trike uses a lithium - ion battery to power its two 2kw motors mounted on the front wheels and emits no emissions			0
@entity11 believes its concept trike could play a role in reducing traffic jams and pollution in cities and is going to roll out its vehicles in @entity173 's @entity172 : mo urban transport system , which will combine different forms of public and private transport including electric car sharing and traffic routing in a large - scale trial			1
despite the vehicle being narrow , its moveable wheels mean that drivers do not need to stabilise the vehicle when it is stationary - like motorcyclists putting their feet on the road surface at traffic lights the vehicle has a closed body with creature comforts such as lighting , heating , audio and @entity204			0

@entity11 has not said if or when the vehicle will go on sale but it will be used in a futuristic trial transport scheme in @entity274 next year
