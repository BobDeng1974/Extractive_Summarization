@entity1 chairman @entity0 said many victims of crime do not call police because they feel ' nothing will be done ' many victims of crime do not bother to call the police because they feel ‘ nothing will be done ’ , a top officer admitted yesterday			1
thousands of offences are going unrecorded as people ask themselves ‘ what ’s the point ? ’ said @entity1 chairman @entity0			1
mr @entity0 , who represents more than 130,000 rank - and - file officers , said forces are not sending out police ‘ as they once would ’			1
and he said repeated @entity18 claims that crime is falling are false because many offences are instead simply falling below the radar			1
he also condemned comments made by the head of the police watchdog this weekend that police may pursue offences that ‘ matter most to people ’ above offences such as shoplifting			1
in an unusually outspoken response , mr @entity0 branded sir @entity32 ’s comments as ‘ disgustingly offensive ’ and ‘ extraordinarily ignorant ’			1
he said they are founded on the mistaken belief that there are fewer crimes for police to deal with and that forces will inevitably shrink			2
‘ crime is n’t falling , ’ he said			2
‘ many people do n’t report crime now because they feel nothing will be done and they are right			2
what ’s the point ? i have every sympathy with them			0
‘ forces have to decide on their local priorities because they do n’t have the resources or time to deal with everything			0
‘ that means officers are not being sent out to deal with incidents as they once would have been			0
‘ officers are being forced not to turn up to crimes because they have no time to deal with them			0
this is not what they signed up to do			0
‘ and while i do agree , some crimes are less serious than others , this is not the case for the victim			0
it is disgustingly offensive to suggest that one victim deserves a better service than another			1
’ mr @entity0 has personal experience of the phenomenon of unrecorded crime after his daughter , a university student in @entity70 , was robbed before @entity72			1
she did not dial 999 , despite being targeted by a cycling robber who snatched her bag , as she knew others had also been targeted and police seemed powerless			0
mr @entity0 said : ‘ she told me : " it happens all the time around here			1
they [ the police ] ca n’t do anything			0
i did n’t get a look at the man and there is no @entity85 so what ’s the point ? " ‘ the point is that unless you record the crimes the police do not know what has happened and they can not do anything about it			0
he said repeated government claims that crime is falling are false because many offences are instead simply falling below the radar ( file picture ) ‘ this is something that is reflected not just among students and universities but up and down the country from shed break - ins to vandalism			1
’ sir @entity32 described mr @entity0 ’s comments as ‘ regrettably intemperate and wholly misconceived ’			1
defending his understanding of the pressures on police , the watchdog denied suggesting some victims deserve a better service than others			0
he said : ‘ it is important that the police service , policing institutions and those who represent police officers work together to ensure that policing is improved			2
‘ that requires a debate conducted in a dignified and intelligent fashion			0
’ sir @entity32 , who was knighted in the new year honours list , also said police facing stringent budget cuts will need to ‘ work smarter ’			1
the chief inspector of the @entity128 suggested forces must analyse demand and target more serious crimes such as drugs , violent offences and the sexual exploitation of children			2
mr @entity0 also branded comments made by sir @entity137 ( pictured ) as ' disgustingly offensive ' he said : ‘ any crime that is reported to the police has to be taken seriously , however there are crimes that are more serious than others			1
‘ nobody would argue that shoplifting is as serious as a violent assault and therefore the police need to look for the crimes that matter most to people … ’ the row comes as forces continue to feel the impact of substantial budget cuts which led to them shedding more than 30,000 officers and staff			1
further job losses are expected as chief constables warn they have stripped back administrative and other costs to the bone			0
last month @entity162 chief constable @entity161 said his force will effectively go out of business within three years if funding is cut further			0
in november forces covering nearly half the population of @entity168 and @entity169 were criticised for failing to investigate crime properly			0
@entity171 said forces are stuck in the past , using out - dated methods to deal with modern - day offences such as cybercrime			0
the watchdog said investigations are sub-standard in 18 of the 43 police forces covering 28 million people including cities such as @entity180 , @entity70 , @entity181 and @entity182			2
the failures were laid bare a week after forces were criticised for ‘ indefensible ’ failures in crime recording which see almost a million offences a year disappear from official figures .			2

@entity0 said forces are not sending out officers ' as they once would '
he said claims crime is falling is only *due* to offences falling below radar
mr @entity0 also branded sir @entity137 *'s* comments ' disgustingly offensive '
sir @entity32 said police should pursue offences ' that matter most to people '
