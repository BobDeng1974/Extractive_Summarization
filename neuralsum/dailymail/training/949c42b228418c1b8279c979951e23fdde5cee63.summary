just two weeks ago @entity2 rushed to @entity3 ’ aid after he received the blow that so tragically cost the young @entity6 batsman his life			1
so it seemed only fitting that it was @entity2 who provided the perfect tribute to @entity3 with an emotionally charged century on day one of the rearranged first test against @entity13 in @entity14			1
@entity2 was quick to dedicate the hundred to @entity3 , saying : ‘ this is probably going to be the best ( century ) of my career			1
that ’s going to stick with me for the rest of my life			2
’ before the match , players , management and match officials lined up in front of a large white 408 — @entity39 number — painted on to the pristine outfield while a tribute played on the big screen			2
players wore black armbands , sported 408 on the chests of their playing shirts , and stood shoulder to shoulder to honour their mate			2
they also joined in 63 seconds of applause for the 25 - year - old , who was 63 not out when struck by a bouncer from @entity53 two weeks ago			2
‘ the initial part before the game started , my emotions took over and it was quite challenging , ’ admitted @entity2			1
‘ i came off to try to regroup a little bit , then i just played with my instincts			0
‘ the adrenaline was pumping and i slowly pulled it in a little bit			0
and i knew i had to , to survive			0
’ @entity2 punches a ball through the covers as he raced to a poignant century ‘ the hardest point of the day for me was when i was on 63 , ’ he said			1
‘ it was such a horrific incident and a rare incident that , in the back of my mind , even though a spinner was bowling , just being on that number , i felt it was n’t right			0
‘ i just wanted to try and get past that			0
@entity28 ( @entity74 ) asked me at the other end if i was ok , and i was			0
i had to step away for a couple of seconds , just to get my thoughts and my processes back			0
’ @entity2 duly found those processes and was already removing his helmet as he jogged the single that took him to three figures midway through the afternoon			1
he kissed the badge on his helmet with feeling , raised his bat and helmet to the sky , looked long towards the heavens , and after two weeks of tension and grief he finally leapt into the air and was engulfed in a bear hug from @entity28			0
as @entity2 buried his head in his captain ’s chest , his shoulders seemed to shake just a little			1
it was his 10th test century , but the most meaningful and highly charged of them all			2
he eventually departed to yet another ovation when he tried to hit @entity13 ’s leg - spinning debutant @entity103 into the @entity104 stand and was caught at deep mid-wicket			0
@entity2 readily admitted to having a tear in his eye as he put on 118 with @entity28 on the first day			1

@entity2 scored *145* from *163* balls as @entity24 *dominated*
tributes to @entity3 took place before the *delayed* first test
@entity2 said he had a tear in his eye during his innings
