just as @entity5 looked to be running out of ideas , @entity71 was caught on 21 off @entity100 ( one for 22 ) to keep the contest alive at 118 for six			0
@entity19 kept the runs ticking over but @entity5 - and @entity18 - refused to lie down as the @entity140 claimed his fourth lbw victim in @entity142 ( nine )			1
