by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:19 est , 31 january 2014 updated : 17:19 est , 31 january 2014 a 16 - year - old @entity5 girl who survived a fall of more than 3,000 feet in a skydiving accident last weekend will be discharged from an @entity9 hospital on friday , a hospital spokesman said			1
@entity10 was flown to the @entity11 on saturday after the accident at a skydiving school in @entity14			1
she will be transferred to a @entity17 - area rehabilitation facility , @entity11 spokesman @entity15 said			1
@entity10 's parents agreed to allow her to skydive as a 16th birthday present , and her father jumped ahead of her			1
when the teen , from @entity23 , @entity5 , jumped , her canopy opened but with a malfunction that she was unable to correct , and she did not deploy a reserve parachute as she had been taught to do			1
the impact of @entity42 's dramatic fall damaged her liver and broke her pelvis , lumbar spine in her lower back , a shoulder blade , several ribs and a tooth			1
doctors said it would be weeks before she could bear any weight , but described the speed of her recovery as remarkable			2
she has not yet had any surgery to correct her myriad injuries			0
' our trauma physician who saw her expected her not to make it when he first saw her , ' @entity15 said			0
' the family thinks this is a miracle			2
it 's remarkable that this happened on a saturday and she 's getting discharged today			0
' @entity31 has said the skydiving company erred in allowing someone so young to jump , even though he signed the company 's waiver			1
the company 's owner said the teenager was taught how to correct the malfunction she experienced during a six - hour training session that she attended with her father before they made their skydives			0
@entity31 described the moment he found out his daughter had fallen earlier this week			0
' the whole way over there , from the time that i knew ( the skydiver was ) going to hit the ground ... it was " please @entity79 , do n't be @entity10 , please please please @entity79 , do n't be @entity10			1
' she is now talking and has feeling back in her extremities			2
miracle : doctors in @entity9 are baffled at how 16 - year - old @entity10 , pictured , survived plunging 3,500ft to the ground after her parachute did n't open properly saturday alive : @entity10 , 16 , fell approximately 3,500 feet to the ground when her parachute apparently malfunctioned confusion : @entity31 , pictured here with his daughter , expected @entity10 to jump tandem with an instructor but he said the company made her go solo ' i was n't there , but if she truly fell 3,500ft i have no idea how she survived , ' @entity101 , the @entity11 trauma surgeon who treated @entity10 , said in the news conference			1
' when i saw her in the emergency department , i would have predicted she was not going to survive all of this			1
but i 'm always happy to be wrong about these things			0
' within 12 hours of arriving at @entity11 medical , @entity10 's internal bleeding had stabilized and she began regaining consciousness , @entity101 said			1
she is expected to be fully recovered after six to eight weeks of rehabilitation			0
@entity10 's parents have slammed the skydiving company , @entity114 , for failing to properly train their daughter ahead of the jump , and claim they offered her only a solo jump rather than tandem with an instructor			1
' she was n't prepared , ' @entity31 said			0
' we were n't walked through the steps for the malfunction that did take place , at all			0
' he added in the news conference : ' i do n't think she should have been allowed to go up there and i find it very hard to believe the rules and regulations in @entity9 are that lax			0
i think it is the company ... ' @entity10 drove to @entity114 in @entity133 , @entity134 for the jump after @entity10 said it was her dream to go skydiving on her 16th birthday			1
in @entity5 , the legal age to sky - dive is 18 but @entity134 allows 16 - year - olds to jump with parental permission			1
@entity10 , who was also in the airplane , successfully jumped before watching from the ground as his daughter tumbled through the air and landed with a thud			1
' she was screaming real bad and acting like she had the wind knocked out of her , wheezing , ' the emotional father recalled			0
' then she started screaming , " get off me , get off me , " and nobody was on her			0
then she told me to rub her back and she 'd start screaming real loud			2
' emergency crews arrived in 15 minutes and began administering aid			2
shocked : ' i was n't there , but if she truly fell 3,500ft i have no idea how she survived , ' @entity101 , the @entity11 trauma surgeon who treated @entity10 , said in a news conference tuesday @entity114 owner @entity159 said @entity10 and her father went through about six hours of training before they jumped , which is standard for new jumpers at @entity114			1
but @entity10 said it was closer to two or three hours			1
according to its website , the registered company requires four hours of training for first - time static line jumpers			0
during training , @entity159 said jumpers are taught how to respond in emergency situations and deploy backup chutes			1
as @entity10 was falling , a radio operator on the ground instructed her to deploy her backup chute , but she did n't do it			1
her parents , who are considering a lawsuit , said she was n't trained properly to respond to the emergency situation mid-air and she was n't strong enough to deploy the second parachute			1
they also suspect her equipment may have been faulty			0
according to @entity159 , who was in the plane with the father and daughter , @entity10 's chute opened fully but took a left turn after opening and spiraled to the ground			1
not so sweet : @entity10 was with her dad @entity188 , who took her to @entity9 to skydive for her 16th birthday excited : in most places and in @entity5 where the @entity192 live , you must be 18 - years - old to skydive			1
to get around the rule , the father and daughter drove to @entity9 , where 16 - year - old @entity10 could jump with her father 's consent ' all i 'm going to say is it had a bit of a turn , and it was n't corrected , ' the 46 - year skydiving veteran said			1
' it probably could have been corrected			0
' meanwhile , her father described his daughter as the ' toughest kid i ever met			0
' ' she never shed one tear , ' he told reporters			0
@entity10 's mother , @entity212 , said she was talked into signing the permission slip because she thought her daughter would be jumping tandem			1
' they talked me into it because of course they said it was safe , she 'd be on somebody 's back , it was n't going to be her responsiblity to do anything , so i did give her permission because she was very excited , ' she recalled through tears			2
' @entity79 's hand caught her , ' @entity10 's older sister @entity229 told @entity231 earlier this week			2
things looked grim after the jump but the teen exuded joy and excitement beforehand			2
@entity10 and her father were there to fulfill her dream to go skydiving			1
' you can be 16 with a parent consent			2
my dad is jumping with me , ' @entity10 tweeted leading up to her perilous fall			1
' she 's still alive and really she should n't be ' : @entity10 's sister @entity229 ( right with @entity10 at left ) says her sister 's survival is nothing short of a miracle it was one of many ecstatic dispatches she 'd send out friday			2
@entity10 's dad jumped first and @entity10 followed thereafter			2
another man decided he did n't want to do it and the instructor stayed behind			0
@entity31 landed safely on the ground and watched helplessly as his daughter spiraled down , her parachute apparently jammed			2
' my dad said that the guy on the ground was talking to [ my sister ] through the radio , ' @entity229 told @entity266			2
' they had a radio in their ears			0
and my dad just heard him keep saying , " reach up			0
you need to calm down , calm down			0
" ' the family believes @entity10 must have panicked and it kept her from fixing her chute or engaging the backup			1
she was rushed to an @entity9 hospital			0
' her vertebrae broke in half , ' @entity229 said			2
' her pelvic bone completely split in half			0
she has more broken bones in her back			2
she has two broken ribs â€¦ her teeth			0
' survivor : according to @entity229 , @entity10 has several broken vertebrae , a shattered pelvis , smashed teeth and serious internal bleeding			1
she was on a breathing machine , but miraculously she was breathing on her own after two days @entity10 also had serious internal injuries including bleeding in her brain , lungs and liver according to a @entity295 account the family set up to keep loved ones updated on @entity10 's well - being			1
she was on a breathing machine at first			0
but miraculously , after two days , she improved enough to start breathing on her own			0
@entity229 says her sister is able to wiggle her toes and can even speak a little			0
' she honestly keeps saying is , she just thinks it was her fault , because she could n't reach up and pull the shoot , ' said @entity229			0
whose fault it was remains unclear			0
@entity10 jumped with her father 's consent , but more often than not a jumper 's first skydive is done tandem - that is , while strapped to the back of a more seasoned jumper			1
this is what her father expected to happen , however , @entity312 only offered solo jumps			0
@entity10 is now focused on her recovery			2
' the whole thing that 's keeping us going is because she 's still alive and really she should n't be , ' @entity229 said .			0
