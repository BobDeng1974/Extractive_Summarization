@entity8 scientists have revealed @entity10 software that can do better than humans on dozens of @entity13 video games from the 1980s , like video pinball , boxing , and @entity26			1
the computer program , called deep q - network , was n't given much in the way of instructions to start , but in time it did better than humans in 29 out of 49 games and in some cases , like video pinball , it did 26 times better , according to a new study released wednesday by the journal @entity38			1
the idea is to create a ' general learning system ' that can figure tasks out by trial and error and eventually to stuff even humans have difficulty with			1
the aim is not to make video games a spectator sport , turning couch potatoes who play games into couch potatoes who watch computers play games			1
the real accomplishment : computers that can teach themselves to succeed at tasks , learning from scratch , trial and error , just like humans			2
the computer program , called deep q - network , was n't given much in the way of instructions to start , but in time it did better than humans in 29 out of 49 games and in some cases , like video pinball , it did 26 times better , according to a new study released wednesday by the journal @entity38			1
it 's a first time an artificial intelligence program bridged different type of learning systems , said study author @entity74 of @entity75 in @entity76			2
@entity77 ' can learn and adapt to unexpected things , ' @entity74 said in a news conference			2
' these types of systems are more human - like in the way they learn			0
' in the submarine game ' @entity84 , ' @entity77 came up with a strategy that the scientists had never considered			0
' it 's definitely fun to see computers discover things that you did n't figure out yourself , ' said study co-author @entity93 , also of @entity8			0
@entity94 , director of the @entity95 at @entity96 , who was n't part of the research , said in an email : ' this is very impressive			0
' most people do n't understand how far ( artificial intelligence ) has come			0
' and this is just the beginning			0
' nothing about @entity105 is customized to @entity13 or to a specific game			1

the idea is to create a ' general learning system ' that can figure tasks out by trial and error and eventually to stuff even humans have difficulty with , @entity74 said			1
this program , he said , ' is the first rung of the ladder			0
' @entity129 computer science professor @entity128 , who also was n't part of the study , said this learning despite lack of customization ' brings us closer to having general purpose agents equipped to work well at learning a large range of tasks , instead of just chess or just ' @entity2 ! '' to go from pixels on a screen to making decisions on what to do next , without even a hint of pre-programmed guidance , ' is really exciting , ' @entity128 said			2
' we do that as people			0
' the idea is that when the system gets scaled up , maybe it could work like asking a phone to plan a complete trip to @entity151 , book all the flights and hotels on its own ' and it sorts it all out as if you have a personal assistant , ' @entity74 said			1
@entity8 scientists have revealed @entity10 software that can do better than humans on dozens of @entity13 video games from the 1980s , like video pinball , boxing , and ' breakout			1
' but to some ways of thinking , @entity77 was n't even as smart as a toddler because it ca n't transfer learned experiences from one situation to another and it does n't get abstract concepts , @entity74 said			0
deep q had trouble with ' ms. @entity173 ' and ' @entity175 ' because they are games that involve more planning ahead , he said			2
next , the scientists will try the system on more complicated games of the 1990s and beyond , perhaps a complicated game like ' civilization , ' where gamers create an entire empire to see if it can stand the test of time			1
deep q is n't showing what @entity74 would call creativity , he said : ' i would call it figuring out something that already existed in the world			0
' creativity would be if the program created its own computer game , @entity74 said			0
artificial intelligence is n't there , he said			0
at least not yet .			0

system will eventually be used to work out complex problems
software can do better than humans on @entity13 video games from the 1980s
