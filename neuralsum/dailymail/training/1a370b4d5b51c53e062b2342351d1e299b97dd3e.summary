eighteen years after it was released @entity4 and @entity5 , two sisters from @entity7 , @entity3 made a parody video of @entity10 's ' @entity9 , ' that pokes fun at the original song which was famously ridiculed by scholars and fans alike for not actually being ironic			1
in the song @entity10 sings about several situations such as rain on your wedding day , finding a black fly in your drink , and being stuck in traffic when you 're already late , that though she labels ironic , are actually just a series of unlucky coincidences			0
now seen over half a million times , the @entity5 's parody embellishes on @entity10 's original lyrics to take the raw situations she presents and inject irony into them			1
though @entity10 's ' @entity9 ' was a popular song in the late 90 's her lyrics were ridiculed for lacking actual irony @entity35 came up with the idea to parody the song after she remembered a teacher criticizing @entity10 for using the rhetoric device incorrectly in the song 's chorus @entity10 sings , ' it 's like rain on your wedding day , ' to which the sisters add , ' a day and place you chose because it known not to rain			1
' other memorable funny lyrics include , ' an old man turned 98 , he won the lottery and died the next day , ' to which they added , ' from a severe paper cut from his lottery ticket			0
' in her music video @entity10 taking a wild road trip with three different sides of herself			2
she appears in different outfits and hairstyles throughout the video in the music video @entity4 and @entity5 ( seen here ) dress up as @entity10 mimicking everything down to her hairstyles the sisters , who imitate @entity10 in the video spoof , wearing their hair in braids and performing eccentric antics , sing , ' we 've got an editorial way of sneaking up on when you think your irony is ok and the examples in your song are right			1
' ' we 've got an editorial way of helping you out when your song about irony is wrong and everyone says it to your face , ' at the song 's bridge			0
@entity10 has taken a lot of criticism for her lyrics to ' ironic ' over the years			0
critics say she uses the device incorrectly , listing scenarios that are unfortunate but not ironic the @entity5 sister 's video went viral on @entity46 getting over half a million views @entity5 even repeatedly intones in a sweet whisper , ' and that really is ironic			1
we fixed it for you @entity10 , you 're welcome			0
' @entity5 and @entity4 told @entity122 that the inspiration for the song came after they remembered hearing an @entity126 teacher correcting the literary device improperly deployed in the lyrics			1
@entity10 claimed that the irony in her video lies in the lack thereof in her lyrics , however critics and fans have never quite bought that explanation the sister 's filmed the video in @entity3 , reenacting the most iconic bits for the parody @entity5 , a stand - up comedian , rewrote the lyrics and collaborated with @entity4 , who is pursuing a career in music to make the video , the paper reported			1
' we felt like [ a video ] would pack the most punch , ' @entity5 said			0
' we were hoping we 'd get a couple hundred views , but then [ ' @entity151 ' actor ] @entity148 tweeted about it and it just blew up			0
' there 's been no word yet from @entity10 on whether or not she finds the video funny , though hopefully this time she 'll be able to find irony in the situation			2
do n't you think ? watch the original @entity10 video here :			2

two sisters from @entity3 made a viral parody video of @entity10 1996 hit ' ironic '
the sister 's injected *blatant* examples of irony into the songs lyrics , which *glaringly* lacks the rhetorical device even though it claims to be sing about it
the parody video is a shot - for - shot remake of the original
