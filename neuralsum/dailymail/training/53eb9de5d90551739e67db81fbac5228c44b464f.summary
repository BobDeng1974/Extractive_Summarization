@entity1 would become a safe haven for rapists , murderers and child molesters if it leaves the @entity6 , senior @entity0 warned today			1

home secretary @entity7 and former immigration minister @entity15 warned @entity1 would become a honeypot for @entity11 's criminals if it leaves the @entity6 opponents of the @entity6 say it risks making it too easy for @entity1 citizens to be extradited			1
some conservative backbenchers have hinted at a revolt when the proposal comes to a vote in the @entity27			0
according to reports , @entity0 chief whipe @entity28 and justice secretary @entity29 have urged @entity31 to ditch the plan in the face of a large - scale rebellion			2
the vote is due within days of the @entity36 by - election , in which @entity38 is expected to triumph over the @entity0 , triggering more calls for a tougher line on @entity11			1
however , the prime minister has made clear that a revolt must be avoided			0
mrs may told the @entity45 : ' if we do n't have these measures in place , it will be harder to keep tabs on terrorists returning from @entity51 and travelling around @entity11 and we would have more foreign criminals in our prisons			2
' @entity1 criminals would be able to hop on to the @entity55 or fly to @entity56 , safe in the knowledge we would n't be able to get them back to prosecute them			2
' however we change our relationship with @entity11 , we will still need to have in place measures that allow us to share information about criminal records , extradite people in and out of the country to face justice and transfer prisoners back to their home countries			1
that would be true even if we left the @entity70 altogether			0
' she added that opting out would see the @entity1 become ' a honeypot for all of @entity11 's criminals on the run from justice '			1
the @entity6 is one of 35 measures the government is seeking to opt back into after having opted out of a raft of more than 100 @entity70 policies relating to justice and home affairs			0
supporters argue it has played a vital role in securing the return to the @entity1 of suspects in significant crimes , including 21/7 bomber @entity88 , who fled to @entity89 , or teacher @entity90 , who was returned from @entity91 to face trial over the alleged abduction of a 15 - year - old girl			2
mr @entity15 upped the rhetoric today , telling @entity97 's @entity96 show that refusing to sign up to the warrant would be ' much more than a sop to @entity38 , that would be really dangerous '			1
' rapists , murderers , child molesters and so on , would think ' @entity1 is the place to go where you 've got most chance of not being convicted for crimes you committed in the rest of @entity11 '			1
it would be very , very bad for the safety of our streets not to have the @entity6			0
' he added : i genuinely ca n't understand why my eurosceptic colleagues have chosen this as a battle to fight because , not opting back into the @entity6 would make this a less safe country			0
we would be the country in @entity11 where all @entity11 's criminals and terrorists would be inclined to come			2
' @entity31 has made clear that the vote later this month should see @entity1 opt back into the @entity6 but opponents claim @entity1 citizens could be extradited on relatively minor charges to countries where they may have no guarantee of a fair trial			2
earlier this month @entity131 , the chairman of the influential @entity132 - seen as the voice of rank - and - file @entity134 - became the most senior figure in the party to speak out and urge the prime minister to think again			0
' i feel very strongly we ought to be bringing powers back to the @entity1 , back to @entity1 democratic control , ' he said			0
' we should n't be ceding powers to the @entity11 institutions			0
i think it sends a message which is really very unhelpful			0
' shadow home secretary @entity147 urged mrs may to say when the government would be opting back into the @entity6 , pledging @entity151 support in a promised commons vote on the issue			1
mrs @entity147 said she was ' pleased ' that mrs may was supporting the measure .			0
