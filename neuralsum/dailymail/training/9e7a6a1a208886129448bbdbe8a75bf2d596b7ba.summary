@entity0 is to be sold off after its owner @entity1 gave up on its long legal battle today			1
the @entity6 company , which recently lost a @entity8 ruling over the @entity10 airport , said it would not make a further appeal and accepts it has to sell it			1
the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) ruled that @entity1 must dispose of @entity14 , @entity0 and one of its @entity17 airports following an inquiry into the company â€™s airport ownership			1
given up : @entity0 , pictured , will now be sold off after @entity1 dumped its legal fight to keep it but @entity1 had fought it for years saying that @entity0 is a completely different operation to @entity24 so it was not breaking competition rules			2
' having carefully considered the @entity8 's recent ruling , @entity1 has decided not to appeal to the @entity27 and is now proceeding with the sale of @entity0 , ' @entity1 said in a statement			0
but added : ' we still believe that the @entity13 ruling fails to recognise that @entity0 and @entity24 serve different markets			0
' the @entity1 decision today ends a process which began as far back as march 2007 when the @entity35 referred @entity1 airport services to the @entity13			0
blow : the @entity1 flag will soon be taken down at @entity0 , having already sold @entity14 and @entity39 they then ruled that @entity1 must sell off @entity14 , @entity0 and one of either @entity42 or @entity39 @entity43 in march 2009			1
@entity14 was sold to @entity44 ( @entity44 ) in december 2009 and @entity44 also took over @entity39 last year			0
but then @entity1 mounted a series of legal challenges to the @entity13 ruling , with the latest one - against the sale of @entity0 - ending in defeat at the @entity50 in july this year			2
after that latest loss , @entity1 said it would appeal to the @entity27 but today the @entity6 - owned company signalled an end to its fight to hang on to @entity0			2
@entity1 , which formerly ran seven @entity56 airports , will have responsibility for just four - @entity24 , @entity58 , @entity42 and @entity59 - once the @entity0 sale is concluded .			0

@entity13 said the @entity6 company must sell the @entity10 airport to avoid a *monopoly*
until today they *pledged* to fight it , which has *included* several legal actions
@entity1 has already sold @entity14 and @entity39 airports and @entity0 will now be next
