by @entity0 published : 05:53 est , 11 january 2013 updated : 05:53 est , 11 january 2013 this incredible video was taken from one of two @entity4 probes which crash landed on the @entity6 last month as they made their final lunar orbits			1
three days before it slammed it slammed into a mountainside , @entity4 's @entity9 spacecraft took this video as it hurtled 6 miles above the northern hemisphere of the @entity6 's far side			1
the video was recorded by the grail mission 's @entity15 ( @entity17 acquired by @entity18 ) which sent back images to @entity21 schools as part of an outreach project			1
desolate : the surface of the @entity6 as seen from the rear - facing camera of @entity4 's @entity15 spacecraft just days before it ended its mission by spectacularly crash landing into a mountain on the far side of the lunar surface flying in formation over the lunar surface , the two @entity4 probes - named @entity9 - helped further our understanding of the early solar system			1
but last month , in a dramatic climax to their mission , the two spacecraft plunged seconds apart into a mountain near the moon 's @entity44			2
the first clip in the video was taken by @entity15 's forward - facing camera and is made up of 931 individual frames			1
the second was taken from its rear camera and is comprised of 1498 frames			0
after the crash landing on december 17 , @entity4 said it had dedicated the impact site in honour of mission team member , @entity56 , the first @entity21 woman in space , who died earlier this year			1
projection : the @entity60 ' trajectory to crash into the moon on december 17 heavenly bodies : an artist 's depiction of the twin spacecraft ( @entity9 ) that comprise @entity4 's @entity15 ( @entity15 ) mission			1
mapping the moon : using a precision formation - flying technique , the twin grail spacecraft -- @entity9 -- have mapped the @entity6 's gravity field , as depicted in this artist 's rendering			1
by design , the spot was far away from the @entity77 landings and other historical sites			0
and even the keenest stargazer would not have spotted the two - washing machine sized probes as they impacted at a speed of 3,800mph , as the collisions occurred on the dark side of moon			0
honouring : @entity4 said it had dedicated the impact site in honour of @entity56 , the first @entity21 woman in space , who died earlier this year but @entity4 's @entity90 which circles the moon will soon be passing over the site and will attempt to photograph the skid marks after the craft slammed into the surface			1
the mission , codenamed @entity97 - was launched in september 2011 from @entity98 and has been deemed a success			2
the twin craft collected data about the moon 's gravity while orbiting at an average altitude of 34 miles , revealing its surface is much thinner than previously thought , gouged out by the impact of thousands of asteroids and comets			1
' it is going to be difficult to say goodbye to our little robotic twins , ' says @entity113 professor @entity112 , grail principal investigator			0
' planetary science has advanced in a major way because of their contributions			0
' @entity9 conducted one final experiment before their mission ends , firing their main engines until their propellant tanks are empty in a bid to determine precisely the amount of fuel left in their tanks			2
@entity4 engineers hope this information will help improve predictions of fuel needs for future missions			0
' our lunar twins may be in the twilight of their operational lives , but one thing is for sure , they are going down swinging , ' said grail project manager @entity139 of @entity4 's @entity140 in @entity141			2
trajectory : the twin lunar - orbiting @entity4 spacecrafts went on a controlled crash into a site named after @entity56 crash landing site : the map shows the region where the twin spacecraft of @entity4 's @entity15 mission will impact on monday a successful mission : the map created by @entity9 has revealed an incredibly pulverized lunar crust , suggesting the moon , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159 were pounded by long - ago impacts far more violently than previously thought			1
blast off : the $ 496 million grail mission - short for @entity15 - launched in september 2011 , and @entity9 reportedly arrived in lunar orbit about three months later			1
' even during the last half of their last orbit , we are going to do an engineering experiment that could help future missions operate more efficiently			0
' the twin craft focused exclusively on measuring the moon 's lumpy gravity field in a bid to learn more about its interior and early history			2
' after flying in formation for months , they produced the most detailed gravity maps of any body in the solar system			0
since the dawn of the @entity181 , more than 100 missions have involved the moon , including @entity4 's six @entity77 landings that put 12 astronauts on the surface			0
the last time the @entity21 space agency intentionally fired a man - made object at the moon was in 2009 , but it was for the sake of science			1
spectators on @entity156 barely saw the faintest of flashes , but the experiment proved that the moon contained water			2
' grail has produced the highest - resolution , highest - quality gravity field for any planet in the solar system , including @entity156 , ' @entity112 reportedly said			2
the resulting map has revealed an incredibly pulverized lunar crust , @entity112 added , suggesting that the moon , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159 were pounded by long - ago impacts far more violently than previously thought			1
mission managers on friday turned off @entity9 's science instruments and ordered a maneuver putting them on course for the rim of the crater , which reportedly sits at a latitude of 75.62 degrees north and a longitude of 26.63 degrees east			2
new moon : this locations on the moon that @entity4 considers ' lunar heritage sites ' and the path @entity15 will take to avoid hitting any of them impact : these 3d renderings show the lunar mountain targeted by the grail mission for controlled impact of the @entity9 spacecraft more than 100 missions have been flung to @entity156 's nearest neighbor since the dawn of the @entity181 including @entity4 's six apollo moon landings that put 12 astronauts on the surface			1
the demise of @entity9 comes on the same month as the 40th launch anniversary of @entity236 , the last manned mission to the moon			0
@entity9 focused exclusively on measuring the moon 's lumpy gravity field in a bid to learn more about its interior and early history			2
after flying in formation for months , they produced the most detailed gravity maps of anybody in the solar system			0
secrets long held by the moon are spilling out			0
@entity9 discovered that the lunar crust is much thinner than scientists had imagined			0
and it was severely battered by asteroids and comets in the early years of the solar system - more than previously realized			0
@entity255 so far also appeared to quash the theory that @entity156 once had two moons that collided and melded into the one we see today			0
besides a scientific return , the mission allowed students to take their own pictures of craters and other lunar features as part of collaboration with a science education company founded by @entity56 , who died in july of pancreatic cancer at age 61			1
bout 3,600 classrooms around the world participated , sending back 114,000 photos			0
scientists expect to sift through data and images from the $ 487 million mission for years .			0

final video taken and sent back to @entity156 as part of school outreach project
it shows the view from the @entity15 probe as it orbited six miles above the @entity6
@entity15 and its twin flow slammed into a lunar mountain on december 17
controlled impact followed year - long mission to map the @entity6 's gravity
crash site named in honour of the late @entity56 , first @entity21 woman in space
