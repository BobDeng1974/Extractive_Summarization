by @entity0 published : 05:11 est , 9 april 2013 updated : 11:09 est , 9 april 2013 a @entity2 barista who started doodling in the froth on top of the coffees he served has become famous for the astonishingly intricate portraits he creates			1
@entity10 , who is also an artist , began his unusual hobby out of boredom last year , trying to see what picture he could create in the lattes he made while working in a hotel in @entity2			1
now he has become the celebrities ' favourite and had stars including @entity19 queuing up to have him draw their portrait in the froth on their drink			0
he began by drawing simple images , such as hearts , but soon moved on to more complicated pictures of historical figures such as @entity28 and @entity55 , characters from popular culture like @entity58 , and celebrities including @entity61 ' @entity60			0
the downside of his work is that the pictures rarely last longer than three minutes - the life - expectancy of the crema on top of a latte			0
watch the full video here @entity70 hero @entity58 is one of the many stars of popular culture immortalised ( for three minutes ) in a latte @entity74 comes to life on top of this latte - but he will soon be drunk by an appreciative customer @entity78 from @entity79 is another character drawn by mr @entity10 on his coffees - @entity19 is a fan @entity81 is one of the @entity2 barista 's chosen subjects , as seen here on top of the coffee counter and the lattes can go cold while you 're admiring the artwork			1
but as a way to gain speedy fame on the internet - mr breach has his own @entity93 - a talent for turning lattes into art is surely a good one			2
the artist told visualnews.com : ' i kind of want to be like @entity101 with coffee - make it interesting and fun for people ; take the pretentiousness out of it , take the seriousness out of it			0
' it would feel like sacrilege to drink this latte , decorated with the image of @entity112 @entity113 as @entity114 was a difficult one to draw because of all the dark of her mask , but she comes out well @entity117 ? @entity118 ? the mother from @entity120 ? not all of mr @entity10 's artworks are immediately recognisable mr @entity10 began by drawing simple motifs then developed a more sophisticated style even cult film 1980s film star @entity125 features in the gallery of @entity10 's latte art marxist revolutionary @entity55 is one of mr @entity10 's favourite subjects and comes out well on top of a latte			2
