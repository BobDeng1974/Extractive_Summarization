one year ago , @entity0 was busy preparing for her fairytale big day , which would be held in a stunning @entity3 castle			1
but with just weeks to go before her wedding , she was dumped by her fiance and lost her Â£ 2,000 deposit - all because of her weight			1
at size 24 , @entity0 , 31 , tipped the scales at a massive 17 stone			1
but the @entity11 call centre worker has had the last laugh			1
not only has she lost seven stone and slimmed to a size 12 , her ex has been left ' stunned ' by her dramatically changed appearance			1
svelte : @entity0 , 31 , has lost seven stone in just one year and now tips the scales at 10 stone toned : @entity0 lost the weight by hitting the gym with a personal trainer and cutting out unhealthy food ' he ended the relationship because of my weight and the issues surrounding it , ' said @entity0 of her former lover - a serving soldier who she does not want to name			1
it was making him miserable			2
' devastated by the split , @entity0 finally decided to do something about her dreadful diet , which included lashings of curry , burgers and crisps plus two litres of @entity41 a day			1
' i was devastated but it was just the thing i needed to spur me on to lose weight , ' she says			2
' when i was 17 stone i had no confidence and i was very unhappy			2
' i used to hide away and i would n't go out			2
i even did my shopping online because i could n't face people			2
' now i feel amazing			2
i have regained my confidence and i do n't think my ex could quite believe his eyes when he saw me			2
' unhealthy : @entity0 's former diet used to include huge portions of curry , burgers and lashings of crisps @entity0 and her boyfriend first became a couple when they were 17 , when she was a size 14			1
she explained : ' i steadily put on weight throughout my teens and my twenties and things got gradually worse			2
' on a typical day i would have macaroni cheese and chips for lunch , snack on crisps and chocolate , then have curry followed by ice cream for tea [ supper ]			1
' i was comfort eating because my boyfriend was in the forces and he was often away for long periods			0
' i would eat large @entity81 meals and drink two litres of @entity41 a day			1
my weight made me feel very depressed			0
' i was moody and when my boyfriend came back i would hide myself away and not come out of the bedroom			0
' he kept on at me about eating healthily and he tried to help me but i was difficult to be with			0
' he proposed to me in 2009			0
i was still about 17 stone then and i made token efforts to control my weight			0
i 'd go to one or two classes , lose a couple of stone and then give up			0
' the couple were due to wed last august at @entity91 in @entity92 , @entity3			0
shock : @entity0 says that being dumped at the altar proved to be the wake - up call she needed fizz fighting : one of the easier parts of @entity0 's new eating regime was cutting out the @entity41 @entity0 said : ' we 'd put deposits down on the venue , the band and even a piper			1
but last march he came to me and said he wanted to end the relationship			0
i have to admit i was difficult to be with and i do n't blame him			0
' i was absolutely devastated but it was the spur i needed to finally do something about my weight problem			0
' @entity0 contacted personal trainer @entity110 of @entity111 , who uses a combination of hypnosis , psychology and gym training			1
@entity110 said : ' we did hypnosis to work on her mental attitude because when she came to me she was very emotional and had a lot of negative thoughts			0
' we worked on that before making a start on the physical side			0
she has been doing interval training - 30 - minute sessions five or six times a week			0
it involves cardio - vascular exercise - bikework and treadmill training			0
' @entity0 really is an inspirational example of what can be achieved			1
a lot of people come to me wanting to lose a lot of weight and they do n't think it 's possible			0
' but @entity0 has shown that with hard work , determination and a change of mindset from negative to positive , you can achieve great things			1
