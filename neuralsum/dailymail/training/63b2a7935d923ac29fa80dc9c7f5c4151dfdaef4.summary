@entity2 , 25 , is currently facing sentencing in @entity33 for the murder of @entity25 sailor , @entity23
he has refused to defend himself and his defense team believe this indicates he wants the death penalty

he was released in 2010 and received a payout of $ 8 million
@entity2 *reportedly* laughed when he was told the victim 's father had been found guilty
