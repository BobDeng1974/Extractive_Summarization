@entity0 has been the bedrock of @entity3 's defence for 12 seasons in a trophy - laden period at @entity7			1
the 35 - year - old 's honours include six @entity10 titles , a @entity11 , a @entity12 and two @entity13 , but despite all that he was told by @entity3 chief @entity15 on sunday that he has no future at @entity7 , making the 1 - 1 draw at @entity18 his 455th and final match for the club			1
the defender got off to a dream debut season at the club making 28 league appearances as @entity3 won the 2002 - 03 @entity10 title - finishing five points clear of second - placed @entity38			1
the following season was met with controversy as @entity0 was slapped with an eight - month ban by the @entity41 in january 2004 after missing a drugs test			0
the sanction resulted in the @entity45 centre half missing the rest of the season and @entity48			0
lean patch : @entity0 finished third with @entity3 during the 2004/05 and 2005/06 seasons after his ban , @entity0 was a virtual ever - present in the @entity3 defence as he played 31 times in the league for the club as they finished third behind @entity58 's @entity57			0
they also finished third in 2005 - 06 but it was better on a personal level @entity61 as he agreed a new four - year deal and also scored his first goal for the club in december 2005 against @entity66			0
@entity3 also beat @entity66 4 - 0 in the @entity68 final at the @entity69 to win their first piece of silverware in three years			0
the stats : @entity0 featured in 312 @entity10 matches for @entity3 , winning six domestic titles double joy : @entity0 was a virtual ever present as @entity3 won back - to - back league titles in 2007 and 2008 the 2006 - 07 and 2007 - 08 seasons were arguably @entity0 's greatest in a @entity3 shirt			1
having formed a formidable partnership with @entity81 - the duo provided the backbone for back - to - back @entity10 title successes			0
in the former campaign , @entity0 made 33 league appearances and 35 in the latter - chipping in with three goals and one assist			0
the 2007 - 08 season was extra special for the defender as he made 11 appearances for sir @entity92 's side en route to winning the @entity11 final against @entity57 in @entity95			2
three and easy : @entity0 won his third successive @entity10 title with @entity3 in 2008 - 09 ( left ) @entity3 again proved they were the team to beat in 2008 - 09 as they won a third consecutive @entity10 title - however , limited the @entity45 star to only 24 appearances			1
as defending champions of @entity103 's elite competition , the defender again featured 11 times as the club lost 2 - 0 in the showpiece to @entity107 in @entity108			0
back injuries started to plague @entity0 towards the end of his career and this showed as he only made 13 league appearances the following season as @entity3 lost the @entity10 to @entity57			2
injury years : back problems limited @entity0 to less than 20 league games per season in 2009 - 10 and 2010 - 11 things were to improve for @entity0 though , as he made 19 appearances as the club successfully regained their crown and eclipsed @entity122 's record of 18 league titles			2
during the 2011 - 12 season , the centre back played 30 times as @entity3 dramatically lost the @entity10 on the final day of the season to their ' noisy neighbours ' @entity128			0

in what proved to be legendary boss @entity92 's last season , @entity0 made 28 league appearances , scoring his final goal for the club in a 2 - 1 win against @entity143 in may 2013			2
@entity0 's final season at @entity3 was a frustrating one for the 35 - year - old			1
