should you fall for pr razzmatazz , there was supposed to be only one star on @entity5 ’s relaunched breakfast show this week : a brunette bombshell with a £ 1 million smile			1
that was the mooted pay cheque dangled in front of @entity11 to defect from the rival @entity13 programme to host @entity14 , a relaunch of the struggling @entity16			1
famous for her sultry routines on @entity19 and her flirtatious leg - crossing when interviewing guests , her appeal was confirmed this week when the lads ’ magazine @entity24 listed her at number 30 in its @entity28 list ( 12 places above ageing model @entity30 — but nine below @entity32 )			1
for the true star of the show is not @entity11 , whose decision to wear a short , thigh - skimming yellow skirt on yesterday ’s show was widely seen as an attempt to boost ratings — but an altogether more unassuming figure			1
step forward @entity36 , a vicar ’s daughter from @entity50 , whose reputation has skyrocketed since she took her place on the sofa alongside @entity11 and their male counterparts , @entity56 and @entity57			1
on monday morning , while her older colleague struggled with the autocue and was visibly angered by the inevitable glitches of a brand new show , @entity58 seemed to glide through with aplomb			1
not surprisingly , the reviewers — and viewers — noticed			1
and if these early signs are anything to go by , @entity11 will have a battle on her hands			1
@entity70 , tv editor of the influential @entity72 website , was in no doubt			1
‘ watched @entity14 this morning , ’ she tweeted			1
‘ @entity36 seems far more comfortable than @entity11 ; she ’s been the star so far			1
’ the general consensus was that the programme needs more of @entity58 and there are already whispers about some tinkering with the format			1
monday ’s debut of @entity14 attracted an improved audience share , but numbers quickly dropped over the next two days , lagging 970,000 behind the @entity13			1
in a cut - throat fight , @entity5 ’s bosses are desperate to prove they are not forever also - rans at breakfast - time , despite memories of the hapless relaunch in 2010 involving celebrity presenters @entity87 and @entity89			1
viewers were initially disappointed to see @entity11 behind a desk along with co-hosts @entity57 , @entity56 and @entity36 indeed , @entity93 , who was a relative unknown when chosen to present tv - am with great success in the @entity97 , had predicted that audiences would be alienated by tales of presenters on stellar salaries			1
and while the true size of @entity11 ’s contract is believed to be nearer £ 400,000 a year , @entity5 chiefs are keen to groom @entity58 , who earns less than a @entity107 head - teacher			1
one fan told me of the former @entity111 anchorwoman : ‘ it ’s almost as if she was made for television			1
she is beautiful , has a stunning figure , is cool under pressure and is professional to a fault			1
this is a woman who gets into work half an hour early , even when her working day starts at 4am			1
’ exactly the type of person that busy mums — the show ’s target audience — can associate with			1
aged 38 , @entity58 is only five years younger than @entity11 , but her career path has been more of a steady rise , without resorting to the hoopla of a celebrity show such as @entity19			1
indeed , her early life was far removed from the bright lights of showbusiness			2
she was raised in a rambling vicarage in the village of @entity136 in @entity137 , three miles south of @entity138 , where her father was the local vicar			2
however , ms @entity11 's legs were soon on show to the nation with what has been described as her ' shrinking skirts ' schoolfriends recall a good - natured , pretty girl with a zest for the outdoors			1
her social life consisted of barn dances , singing in the choir , acting in the village panto and windsurfing with her older brother off the golden sands at nearby @entity156			2
from a young age , she set her heart on becoming a journalist , writing articles as a youth reporter for her local newspaper and then taking shifts at a hospital radio station			2
her other passion was the @entity166 , graduating from being a @entity167 and remaining a committed member until she left school			2
such solid grounding gave her a sensible view of the burgeoning celebrity culture , telling @entity173 many years later : ‘ @entity175 too many celebrities are unhealthily thin and ridiculously materialistic			2
like most people , i buy a new dress and pair of shoes every now and again , but people should have a sense of proportion			2
’ @entity58 , who won the coveted @entity184 ( the ultimate @entity173 accolade ) , is unapologetic about her belief in the principles she learned as a teenager			2
‘ the whole ethos of @entity166 is a good one to follow , ’ she added			2
‘ it encourages honesty , reliability , politeness , cheerfulness and respect for others			2
these things are so important			2
‘ and i still do a good turn every day — whether it ’s holding a door open for someone , helping someone with a pram up some stairs or just taking the time to talk to someone i meet			2
’ such a belief in the merits of hard work saw her through a degree in @entity211 at @entity212 , followed by a postgraduate degree in broadcast journalism at the @entity215			2
her professional career began in radio , followed by a stint at @entity219 , where she rose from trainee to presenter of the main news			0
in 2007 , she moved to @entity223 , where she presented @entity224 , the breakfast news programme , with @entity226			0
meanwhile @entity36 , right , has been a critical success with viewers during the high - profile breakfast show an influential figure at @entity111 , the veteran presenter does n’t suffer fools gladly ( his description of @entity234 as ‘ @entity235 ’ after a torrid time working on @entity5 ’s breakfast sofa in the @entity237 has passed into broadcasting folklore )			1
yet in @entity58 he found a willing and able protegee			0
ever eager to improve , she would arrive to work an hour and a half early , get a grasp of all the news stories of the day and be primed by the producers			0
on one memorable occasion , the autocue went blank just as the titles rolled and the pair had to improvise			0
i ’m told @entity226 just looked into the camera and said : ‘ here ’s @entity36			1
’ ‘ she took over and did an amazing job			0
you could n’t help but be impressed			0
i know @entity226 was , ’ says a @entity111 insider			0
though part of her job means having to join the celebrity carousel ( such as attend a charity dance event laid on by @entity111 ) , she remains hearteningly down - to - earth			0
as for her personal life , @entity58 had been going out with @entity261 , now 40 , a senior executive at drinks firm @entity262 , for a decade before they married in 2008			0
the ceremony was at @entity265 ( thanks to her vicar dad ’s links ) , with the guests ferried to the reception in a specially decorated vintage red double - decker bus			0
@entity5 bosses are fearful that this week 's expensive relaunch of their vital breakfast show will follow the earlier failure hosted by @entity89 and @entity87 home is a three - bedroom @entity279 house in @entity281 , which the couple bought for £ 700,000			1
her husband wallpapered and fitted the bathrooms , while @entity58 painted the house herself			0
they had previously lived in a one - bedroom flat in @entity289 , @entity290			0
a comfortable existence then , but hardly @entity292			0
one friend says : ‘ @entity58 is a girly girl , not a big drinker			0
anyway , with the ridiculously early hour she has to wake up in the morning , i can assure you she ’s not out partying			0
‘ sometimes , she ’s a bit bewildered by any attention			0
once , we were in a pub watching football on the tv when this bloke said to her : “ @entity306 ! you ’re that gorgeous girl off @entity111			0
” ‘ @entity58 just smiled , said hello and then went back to watching the football			0
she prefers to live her life quietly and with a minimum of fuss			0
’ how different from @entity11 , who in recent months has been regular front - page news and celebrity magazine fodder following her split from her partner of 15 years , the father of her three children			0
away from the studio , @entity58 enjoys cycling , horse - riding and going for long walks with her dog , a terrier cross called @entity323 she adopted from an animal rescue centre			0
in the absence of children ( though they have certainly not been ruled out ) , she dotes on him			0
meanwhile , she spends much time concerned about the ailing health of her father , @entity330 , 77 , who was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2011			0
with her apprenticeship alongside @entity226 , @entity58 sees herself as a natural no 2			0
but if audience reaction to @entity14 is anything to go by , she could soon turn into a no 1			0
even in this age when only pushy divas seem to rise to the top , @entity36 has the innate talent to prove that theory wrong .			1

critics are praising @entity36 and her *understated* *performance*
insiders *suggest* that there may be some ' tinkering ' with the show 's format
@entity5 chiefs are keen to groom ms @entity36 for a starring role in future
