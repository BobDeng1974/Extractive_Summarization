gift : prime minister @entity1 claims the donations are a mark of @entity5 's compassion an @entity7 farmer has been given legal aid in the @entity5 to sue @entity5 – because he claims millions of pounds sent by the @entity5 to his country is supporting a brutal regime that has ruined his life			1
he says @entity5 taxpayers ’ money – £ 1.3 billion over the five years of the coalition government – is funding a despotic one - party state in his country that is forcing thousands of villagers such as him from their land using murder , torture and rape			1
the landmark case is highly embarrassing for the government , which has poured vast amounts of extra cash into foreign aid despite belt - tightening austerity measures at home			1
prime minister @entity1 claims the donations are a mark of @entity5 ’s compassion			1
but the farmer – whose case is set to cost tens of thousands of pounds – argues that huge sums handed to @entity7 are breaching the @entity37 ’s ( @entity37 ) own human rights rules			1
he accuses the government of devastating the lives of some of the world ’s poorest people rather than fulfilling promises to help them			0
the case comes amid growing global concern over @entity47 aid propping up corrupt and repressive regimes			1
if the farmer is successful , ministers might have to review major donations to other nations accused of atrocities , such as @entity54 and @entity55 – and it could open up @entity5 to compensation claims from around the world			1
@entity7 , a key ally in the @entity60 ’s war on terror , is the biggest recipient of @entity5 aid , despite repeated claims from human rights groups that the cash is used to crush opposition			1
@entity37 was served papers last month by lawyers acting on behalf of ‘ mr o ’ , a 33 - year - old forced to abandon his family and flee to a refugee camp in @entity75 after being beaten and tortured for trying to protect his farm			1
he is not seeking compensation but to challenge the government ’s approach to aid			1
his name is being withheld to protect his wife and six children who remain in @entity7			0
‘ my client ’s life has been shattered by what has happened , ’ said @entity86 , the lawyer handling the case			0
‘ it goes entirely against what our aid purports to stand for			2
’ mr @entity96 ’s family was caught in controversial ‘ villagisation ’ programmes			0
under the schemes , four million people living in areas opposed to an autocratic government dominated by men from the north of the country are being forced from lucrative land into new villages			1
their land has been sold to foreign investors or given to @entity7 with government connections			2
people resisting the soldiers driving them from their farms and homes at gunpoint have been routinely beaten , raped , jailed , tortured or killed			0
@entity115 : the farmer claims villagers are being attacked by troops driving them from their land ‘ why is the @entity60 , especially the @entity5 , giving so much money to the @entity7 government when it is committing atrocities on my people ? ’ asked mr o when we met last year			1
his @entity126 - based lawyers argue that @entity37 is meant to ensure recipients of @entity5 aid do not violate human rights , and they have failed to properly investigate the complaints			1
@entity132 has issued several scathing reports highlighting the impact of villagisation and showing how @entity7 misuses aid for political purposes , such as diverting food and seeds to supporters			2
concern focuses on a massive scheme called @entity143 , which is designed to upgrade public services and is part - funded by @entity37			2
force : @entity7 federal riot police point their weapons at protesting students in a square in the country 's capital , @entity152 critics say this cash pays the salaries of officials implementing resettlements and for infrastructure at new villages			2
@entity37 officials have not interviewed mr @entity96 , reportedly saying it is too risky to visit the @entity163 - run camp in @entity75 where he is staying , and refuse to make their assessments public			2
a spokesman said they could not comment specifically on the legal action but added : ‘ it is wrong to suggest that @entity5 development money is used to force people from their homes			0
our support to the @entity173 programme is only used to provide healthcare , schooling , clean water and other services			0
’ intimidation : riot police confront a man ( not the claimant ) near the @entity181 as officers beat rock - throwing students during a demonstration as he showed me pictures on his mobile phone of his homeland , the tall , bearded farmer smiled fondly			1
‘ we were very happy growing up there and living there , ’ he said			0
this was hardly surprising : the lush @entity194 of @entity7 is a fertile place of fruit trees , rivers and fissures of gold , writes @entity200 that was the only smile when i met mr @entity96 in the @entity203 refugee camp in @entity75 last year			0
he told me how his simple family life had been destroyed in seconds – and how he blames @entity5 aid for his misery			2
‘ i miss my family so much , ’ he said			0
‘ i do n’t want to be relying on handouts – i want to be productive			0
’ his nightmare began in november 2011 when @entity7 troops accompanied by officials arrived in his village and ordered everyone to leave for a new location			0
men who refused were beaten and women were raped , leaving some infected with @entity218			0
i met a blind man who was hit in the face and a middle - aged mother whose husband was shot dead beside her – she still bore obvious the scars from her own beating and rape by three soldiers			1
unlike their previous home , their new village had no food , water , school or health facilities			0
they were not given farmland and there were just a few menial jobs			0
‘ the government was pretending it was about development , ’ said mr @entity96 , 33			0
‘ but they just want to push the indigenous people off so they can take our land and gold			2
’ after speaking out against forced relocations and returning to his village , mr @entity96 was taken to a military camp where for three days he was gagged with a sock in his mouth , severely kicked and beaten with rifle butts and sticks			0
‘ i thought it would be better to die than to suffer like this , ’ he told me			0
afterwards , like thousands of others , he fled the country ; now he lives amid the dust and squalor of the world ’s largest refugee camp			1
he says their land was then given to relatives of senior regime figures and foreign investors from @entity266 and the @entity267			1
‘ i am very angry about this aid , ’ he said			2
‘ @entity5 needs to check what is happening to its money			0
‘ i hope the court will act to stop the killing , stop the land - grabbing and stop your government supporting the @entity7 government behind this			1
’ as the dignified mr @entity96 said so sagely , what is happening in his country is the precise opposite of development .			2
