@entity0 opened his @entity2 challenge with a 6 - 3 6 - 3 win over @entity4 , although his performance failed to inspire in the @entity7 city			1
in a match littered with poor serves and unforced errors , the third seed , who won the title here in 2009 , just about held the edge to progress through to a second - round meeting with @entity18 's @entity17			2
@entity0 is playing in his fifth consecutive tournament , having won in @entity20 last weekend , and is looking to secure his place at the @entity22 next month , but will have to improve significantly if he is to better the result of rival @entity24 , who is the top seed in @entity7 and aiming to bump the @entity26 from his current eighth place in the race to @entity29			1
@entity0 defeated @entity4 to move a step closer to securing his @entity22 spot @entity0 keeps his eye on the ball as he looks to return a shot from @entity35 's @entity4 7			1
@entity36 ( @entity37 ) - 4,105 8			0
@entity0 ( @entity38 ) - 3,885 --- --- --- --- - 9			2

@entity24 ( @entity41 ) - 3,775 11			0
@entity42 ( @entity43 ) - 3,555 * standings on wednesday october 22 @entity0 , who came into the contest with a 6 - 0 head - to - head record against the @entity35 , looked settled in the early stages and was a break up in just the third game when @entity4 put a weak forehand into the net			1
however , his serve then went off the boil and a double fault from the @entity26 gave his @entity35 opponent an immediate break back , although @entity4 's wide return in game five again put @entity0 in the driving seat			1
@entity0 battled once more to hold his next service game but this time the outcome was more favourable as the third seed took a 4 - 2 lead			0
and although the world no 10 continued to perform below par , the occasional flash of brilliance - coupled with an ill - timed and costly double fault from @entity4 - saw the @entity26 secure the opening set in 41 minutes			0
it was @entity4 who drew first blood in the second set , breaking in the opening game with a tidy forehand across the court			0
@entity0 was far from at his best against @entity4 but managed to beat the @entity35 in straight sets @entity0 currently occupies the last race to @entity29 but faces competition from @entity7 's @entity24 it was not a match for tennis purists , with too many unforced errors and ugly shots from both sides of the net , and it was no surprise when @entity0 broke straight back after @entity4 fired wide			1
an upturn in form then looked on the cards when @entity0 won his next two service games to love , and his fortunes improved further in game six when he fought back from 0 - 40 to break once more			2
@entity4 's temper spilled over and the world number 121 smashed his racquet frame in frustration , earning a warning from the umpire			2
yet the @entity97 could not hold on to his advantage , and another poor forehand found the net to leave the set back on serve			0
the topsy - turvy nature of things continued as a lazy , under - hit shot from @entity4 gifted his opponent one more break and left @entity0 serving for the match			1
and although he did it the hard way , saving two break points , the @entity108 eventually emerged the winner thanks to another error from @entity4 .			0

the @entity115 won in straight sets against @entity35 's @entity4
@entity0 is eighth in the current race for @entity29 standings
@entity24 is *hoping* to take @entity121 to @entity29 spot
