i still ca n’t believe and ca n’t know how it happened			0
' i saw the vehicle but there were no hazard lights			0
i did n’t realise it was stopped , it was too late for me to much brake			0
' he said he left the @entity38 because he was afraid he would be jailed and deported , and went to @entity50 with his partner where they married three months after the crash			2
the couple , who now have two children aged seven and two , returned to the @entity38 for good in 2007			2
asked by police why he had not handed himself into them before , @entity10 replied : ' now i have small kids and imagine being far from them			2
i was in too much distress and in too much fear of going to prison and being apart from my children			0
' i can never forget this , it changed my life upside down			0
i could n’t sleep at night , it would all come back every time i tried to sleep			0
' now i am feeling relieved to be facing this once and for all and to get my punishment			0
i did n’t come forward , that was my mistake and i very regret this			0
