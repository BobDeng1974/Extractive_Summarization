by @entity0 switched off : the lamps in @entity2 , @entity3 , had been extinguished to cut costs when a series of cars were broken into in quick succession , victims were quick to dial 999 to call for help			1
and the police were soon on the case , using dogs to hunt the culprit before bravely giving chase when a suspect was seen running away			1
until , that is , the manhunt was abruptly called off – because it was ‘ too dark ’ for it to continue			2
last night it was still not clear whether the officers were scared of the dark , or concerned about the risk of tripping			2
but angry local residents said it was ridiculous that a criminal had been allowed to escape when they were on the verge of being caught red - handed			2
the incident took place in @entity2 , @entity3 in the early hours of saturday a fortnight ago			1
residents called the police after they discovered somebody had broken into several cars and swiped wallets , electrical gadgets , designer sunglasses and a mountain bike			1
officers from @entity39 immediately responded and arrived with dogs to track down the thief			1
they managed to catch sight of a suspect – but he was able to escape after officers decided it was too dark to pursue him on foot			1
a statement from a @entity48 volunteer who was briefed by police blamed a new streetlight switch - off scheme which is meant to save the council £ 1million a year			1
the statement read : ‘ a figure was chased but due to the light switch - off it was almost impossible for officers to search the area effectively and no one was detained			1
’ growing areas of @entity57 are seeing streetlamps switched off at night by cost - cutting councils , despite fears that the measure will lead to a rise in crime			0
a survey suggested two - thirds of councils were either dimming street lights or turning them off to cut bills			0
around 750,000 lights in 81 local authority areas are thought to be involved in the switch - off			1
@entity71 launched its @entity73 and @entity74 lighting scheme a few months ago , saying 70,000 street lights would be turned off between midnight and 5.30am			0
nothing we can do : police spotted the suspect but were unable to apprehend him ( file photo ) but residents of the @entity83 estate said the measure has left them feeling unsafe at night			2
@entity85 , 42 , said : ‘ there are places that were safe where you just ca n’t go now after the lights are off			0
it ’s pitch black up there and people just do n’t feel safe			0
‘ i ’m getting security lights fitted today and i know a number of my neighbours are thinking about doing the same			0
’ a council spokesman said : ‘ we continue to work closely with police to monitor crime			0
we will review the lighting requirements if any increase can be attributed to the absence of street lighting			0
’ and a police spokesman added : ‘ it is too early in the scheme to give any indication as to whether the reduction on lighting levels has impacted on crime			0
’ they were unable to say whether the officers involved were afraid of the dark .			0

residents in @entity2 , @entity3 , called police when thief broke into several cars
