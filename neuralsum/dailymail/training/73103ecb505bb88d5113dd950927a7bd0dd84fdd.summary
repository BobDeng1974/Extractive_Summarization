sir @entity0 has risked the wrath of @entity3 cycling fans by setting himself the astonishing target of delivering a first @entity6 winner in 30 years			1
after masterminding @entity9 ’s @entity8 cycling success , @entity0 created a ‘ @entity3 ’ pro team at @entity11 with the sole intention of delivering a first @entity14 winner			1
it was central to his mission statement at the launch of @entity11 in february 2009			0
but in an interview with the @entity21 sports daily @entity19 , @entity0 said : ‘ we have won the tour with a @entity3 rider , but when are we going to see a @entity21 rider win the @entity23 ? that would be enormous			1
‘ i think it needs to happen			0
for the @entity23 , for @entity21 , for the @entity21 , for the sport , having a @entity21 winner would be massive			1
‘ i think about it often			0
@entity21 deserves a @entity21 winner			1
’ it was only a few months ago that @entity0 stepped down as performance director of @entity3 cycling , having concluded it was proving too much to combine the role with his job as team principal at @entity11			1
but there is no doubt that @entity11 has benefitted from the relationship that continues with @entity3 cycling – and vice versa of course - and the desire to deliver a @entity21 champion could be unpalatable to many of those involved			1
particularly when there is such a sharing of resources that has even extended to their headquarters in @entity59			0
popular : @entity3 cycling fans have been happy with @entity62 's impact but may not like his latest comments winning formula : @entity0 's work helped make @entity68 winner ... winning formula : ... and then helped @entity69 to celebrate another @entity14 triumph @entity0 is now looking to establish a permanent hq in @entity72 for the pro team			1
but there is £ 30million of public money invested in the @entity3 team building towards the @entity77 in 2016 and that will be supporting some of @entity11 ’s riders			2
when @entity11 announced their plans to launch a pro cycling team in february 2009 , they celebrated ‘ the creation of a professional @entity3 road cycling team ’ to be ‘ managed by @entity9 @entity8 performance director @entity85 ’			1
the statement added : ‘ @entity11 will build on the principles that make @entity3 riders a consistent success on the track and will support @entity11 ’s work as principal partner of @entity93 , fuelling the sport from grass roots to elite level			2
‘ @entity11 will aim to create the first @entity3 winner of the @entity6 , within five years			2
’ in the statement @entity0 said : ‘ this will be an epic story ; building a @entity3 team to take on the best in professional cycling , and win			2
’ it added that ‘ @entity11 will have a core of @entity3 riders ’			2
@entity0 has delivered , with @entity69 following sir @entity106 in becoming the second @entity3 winner of the @entity23 in two years last time round			0
@entity69 is the favourite to win again this year to establish an era of dominance for @entity11			0
not since @entity111 in 1985 have the @entity21 had a winner of their race			0
willing public : interest in cycling is on the rise , topped by @entity9 's @entity6 hosting management : @entity62 is shown here with @entity3 favourite @entity69 but it seems he prefers the @entity21 a fluent @entity21 speaker , @entity62 may be guilty of nothing more than trying to please his audience the day before the @entity23 rolls into @entity21 , but with @entity125 and @entity126 among those omitted from @entity11 ’s nine - man @entity128 , there are only two @entity3 riding in @entity130 and @entity131			1
many of @entity11 ’s rivals select riders predominantly from their country of origin			0
@entity137 has nine @entity21 riders , @entity138 eight @entity21 , @entity140 seven @entity139 and @entity142 seven @entity141			0
in fairness to @entity62 , he has long insisted riders would not be selected based on their passports			0
from a total squad of 28 at @entity11 , there are in fact nine @entity3 riders			2
leading the pack : but unlike other teams , @entity11 do n't just boast cyclists from their main country @entity155 takes yellow jersey after stage two win - highlights			0

@entity11 has links with @entity3 cycling but @entity62 wants a @entity21 winner
he masterminded @entity166 's @entity8 cycling success before *joining* @entity11
and helped produce back - to - back @entity14 winners
he tells @entity19 @entity21 win ' needs to happen '
