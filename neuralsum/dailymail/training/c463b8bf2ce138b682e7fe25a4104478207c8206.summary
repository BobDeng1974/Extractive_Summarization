by @entity0 published : 05:29 est , 12 july 2013 updated : 08:06 est , 12 july 2013 @entity1 : @entity2 , 24 , was catapulted from the @entity4 ride and landed on her head but did n't realise she had broken her neck until two days later a hardy thrill - seeker who was thrown out of her seat on a fairground ride put in a six hour shift at work the following day without realising she had broken her neck			1
@entity2 , 24 , was catapulted from the @entity4 ride - which spins around and is tilted up and down as passengers sit along the inside of a wall without seat belts or straps to restrain them			1
she was thrown up in the air and landed on her head in the middle of the metal enclosure - smashing her fifth vertebra			1
her friends said it was ' the funniest thing they had ever seen ' but despite being in pain , @entity2 shrugged it off and got back in her seat			1
she finished the ride unaware she had a broken neck and the following day did a six - hour shift at work as a cleaner			2
but after two days of being in pain she was unable to lift her head from her pillow and went to hospital where doctors diagnosed a fracture of the fifth vertebra on her spine			1
stunned medics told her she could have been paralysed following the incident at @entity42 in @entity43			0
@entity2 , of @entity44 , @entity45 , was with friends and her boyfriend @entity47 on the ride on june 28			1
she said : ' you 're supposed to hold on to the bars behind your head but when it 's in motion the workers operating it tell you to put your hands up in the air and then bounce the carriages up and down along to the music			2
' i bounced off the seat a few metres into the air at a vertical angle and did a little flip and landed on my head on the metal floor in the centre of the ride			1
' they stopped the ride and asked if i was alright but because i was a bit embarrassed about it i put my thumb up and they just told me to get back on the seat			1
diagnosis : @entity2 only went to hospital two days after the incident , where she discovered she had a fracture of the fifth vertebra on her spine ' my neck and my head were really painful but everyone was watching me and i was in shock so i got back on my seat and they set the ride off again			1
' my friends were all laughing saying it was the funniest thing they had ever seen			2
they felt terrible for laughing when they saw me in bed with a neck brace a few days later			0
' the day after the incident @entity2 woke up with a stiff neck and took painkillers thinking it might be whiplash and did a six - hour shift at work			2
she said : ' when i woke up the next morning my neck was really stiff and sore but i had to quickly get ready for work so i did n't have much time to think about it			0
fairground : the @entity4 ride spins passengers around and tilts them up and down as they sit along the inside of a wall without seat belts or straps to restrain them ' at work my boss suggested i had whiplash because of the way i was walking			1
i had been thrown forward by quite a force so it made sense that i had whiplash			0
' injury : @entity2 was immobilised in hospital for three days and must wear a collar for at least six weeks the next morning she could not lift her head from the pillow and went to hospital where medics immediately put a collar round her neck			1
a scan then showed part of the fifth vertebra had broken off and three others were bruised			0
she said : ' when i woke my upper body felt paralysed to the bed and i knew something was seriously wrong			0
' when i got some feeling back in my body i drove myself up to the hospital because i still did n't think it was as serious as it was			2
' at the hospital the doctor said i must have hit my head at some force			2
' @entity2 was immobilised in hospital for three days and must wear a collar for at least six weeks			1
she said : ' i 've been very lucky			0
it 's scared me to death what might have happened to me			0
i used to love roller coasters but i think i 'll be steering clear from now on			0
' the @entity148 has launched an investigation into the accident			0
@entity151 , of @entity152 , said : ' all i can say is that it has been reported to the @entity148 and our insurance company			0
' it is up to people using it to sit down and not mess about			0
plenty of these rides are operating and this one is in first - class condition			0
