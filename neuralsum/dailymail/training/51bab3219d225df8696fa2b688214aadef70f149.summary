inspired by the self - driving hoverchairs in @entity2 , an inventor has created a one - wheeled vehicle controlled using signals from his brain			2
@entity6 , the rechargeable device connects to a smartphone app and a pair of specially - designed goggles			1
these goggles register the rider 's brain impulses before sending them to the app , which controls the novel mode of transport			1
it is controlled using electrical impulses in his brain via specially - designed goggles ( pictured )			1
the goggles then send these signals to a smartphone app via @entity24 it was created by 24 - year - old inventor @entity18 from @entity26 , @entity19			1
the goggles pick up signals by monitoring changes in electrical impulses released by his brain			1
these signals are sent to the app via @entity24 and are converted into commands , including accelerate and decelerate			2

@entity38 weighs almost four stone ( 55lbs or 25kg ) and reaches speeds of 16mph ( 25km/h )			0
it then travels up to 18 miles ( 28km ) on a four - hour electric charge			1
it can also be steered by leaning to the side , similar to how @entity45 and the @entity47 work			0
the freelance designer said : ‘ the original idea came after watching 2008 @entity51 film @entity2 in which human beings control hover crafts with their brains			0
‘ i wanted to create the @entity6 to use the least amount of energy possible			2
‘ i worked alongside mechanics in order to create my design , before ordering the plastic mould from @entity61			0
’ his @entity62 weighs almost four stone ( 55lbs or 25kg ) and reaches speeds of 16mph ( 25km/h )			0
it then travels up to 18 miles ( 28km ) on a four - hour electric charge , which works out at just 25p a trip			1
mr @entity18 additionally designed the goggles to detect risk and safety impulses released by different areas of the user 's brain			1
when the goggles detect these impulses they communicate with the @entity6 via the app to accelerate or slow down			2
this is named ' psycho mode ' , because the device is psychologically controlled			0

mr @entity18 continued : ‘ it is still early days , at the moment there is no restriction for road use			0
‘ i am constantly working on the @entity99 , incorporating new technologies day - by - day , in order to eventually have the product market - ready			0
’ the latest addition to the @entity6 is a @entity24 based motion sensitive tracker			0
mr @entity18 , who has spent the last 18 months working on this incredible invention , admitted he has ended up in hospital during tests , fracturing both of his wrists			2

’ ‘ money is not important to me , i would much prefer that my design helps people that have to travel miles for water every day			0
‘ i 'd love for it to be available to those that have to walk for hours just to get to school			0
‘ i am planning on continuing to work on the @entity6 and look forward to adding and altering the design until i 'm happy that it is complete			0

the @entity6 was designed by @entity18 from @entity19
it is controlled using electrical impulses in the 24 - year - old inventor 's brain
these impulses are registered by goggles , which send the signals to an app
the rechargeable device travels for 18 miles ( 28km ) on a four - hour charge
it is currently a *prototype* and needs further testing before being released
