if you 've taken up running to lose weight but have found you 've gained more pounds than you 've shed , a personal trainer has the reason why			1
fitness fanatic @entity4 has helped hundreds of people get into shape after they have failed to lose weight despite following a tiring exercise regime			1
writing on her blog , @entity4 explains that the problem is many people are doing the wrong kind of exercise to shed fat			1
her motto is to ' go harder , not longer '			0
she believes that if people only do long , steady exercise - like slow marathon training runs - they wo n't lose weight			1
in fact , their bodies will cling to fat to help them keep running for miles			0
it will then want to store energy as fat to ensure it has plenty of reserves to get through all the miles it is used to			2
' people often also reward themselves after a run by over-eating and consuming more calories than they burnt off making their fat burning efforts futile			0
of course , @entity4 agrees that running is a great form of exercise with numerous health benefits and many people take pleasure from the sport for reasons beyond dropping a dress size			1
raising the heart rate : @entity4 demonstrates a jumping exercise that involves moving from side to side of the step no need to join a gym : using weights at home have helped @entity4 get into shape but @entity4 said if your primary goal for running is to lose weight , then long , slow runs are not the best way to shed fat			1
you may drop pounds initially , but then find your weight stagnates			0
the 37 - year - old has learnt this from her own experience			2
when training for marathons and ultra marathons , she spent hours pushing herself to run long distances but did n't lose any weight			1
she thought the answer was to put even more time - consuming miles in - which eventually led to illness and injury - and she still did n't have the body she wanted			2
she says : ' i 've never been obese but i certainly had some stubborn extra pounds i just could n't seem to shift			2
and for a fitness writer , that is not a good a look			0
' but now @entity4 has a healthy lean and toned physique without an inch of fat , and she says it 's all thanks to high intensity exercise and pumping iron			1
hold it : core stability moves like this one help @entity4 get her flat stomach join in : the personal trainer has recorded her workouts so clients can follow the routine she said : ' when i switched from long steady exercise to short , high - intensity sessions and added more variety and strength training into my training mix , my body changed			1
the fat came off , my energy levels soared and i became healthier , stronger and fitter			0
' now @entity4 spends less time working out than she did when she was going for 50 mile runs but is in much better physical shape			2
her workouts - which she is sharing in a new online programme , @entity117 , that begins next week - includes weight lifting , core stability exercises and short bursts of efforts which raise the heart rate			1
she said these 20 - 40 minute workouts are much more effective for weightloss because of the “ afterburn ” effect			0
she explains : ' your metabolic rate goes through the roof and stays elevated even after you finish training while your body adapts and recovers			2
this will cause you to burn more fat for 24 - 48 hours after exercising , depending on how intense the training was			2
of course , you also get the health and fitness improvements that come as a result of working your heart , lungs and muscles harder			0
' on top of her workouts , @entity4 still runs but instead of doing long , slow plods , she does shorter , faster ones			1
she recommends her clients stick to running no more than 30 minutes at a time if their main aim for exercising is fat loss			0
one of @entity4 's clients , @entity150 , 40 , from @entity151 , said it certainly worked for her			0
she explains on her blog how she lost a stone after swapping long slow runs for weight lifting and high intensity training			1
new fitness regime : @entity150 has lost weight , left , even though she does n't run as much			2
she was a stone heavier before she did weights and high intensity training , right slimmer : @entity150 before , left , and after she followed @entity4 's advice on exercise she said : ' i 'm not saying that running makes you fat or that it 's impossible to lose some fat through long distance running			1
however , there are other forms of exercise that give much greater bang for the buck in terms of torching fat			0
so if fat loss is your top priority then in my experience your time would be better spent on lifting weights or exercising at high intensity for short bursts			1
' @entity150 explains that when she trained for her first marathon , she over indulged on the wrong foods as the endurance - based training made her hungry			0
she said : ' when i was training for my first marathon i ate all the carbs			0
i fuelled my runs on pasta , rice , bread , porridge , pizza , sweets , chocolate , cake			0
' she added : ' it 's so easy to reward yourself with a carby sugary treat after a long run			0
" go on , have that slice of cake , you 've run for miles - you deserve it "			0
all fine , except that if fat loss is your priority then rewarding yourself with cake and chocolate probably is n't going to help your progress too much in the long run			0
' since taking advice from @entity4 , @entity150 has learnt to eat carbs on moderation , re-fuel with protein - based snacks instead of sugary ones , and eat more vegetables			2
as a result , she 's found not only has she lost weight , she 's also become a faster runner , gaining personal best times over 5k to marathon since swapping her long - distance jogs for @entity4 's strengthening exercises and high intensity training			1
