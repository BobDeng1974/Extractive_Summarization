by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity3 regulators are crafting a rule that would require all new vehicles to be able to ' talk ' to one another using wireless technology , which the @entity8 said would significantly reduce accidents on the roads and alleviate traffic congestion			1
a rule mandating so - called vehicle - to - vehicle communication technology should be put in place before president @entity16 leaves office in early 2017 , @entity8 officials said on monday			1
a radio beacon would continually transmit a vehicle 's position , heading , speed and other information			2
cars would receive the same information back from other vehicles , and a vehicle 's computer would alert the driver to an impending collision			2
some systems may automatically brake to avoid an accident if manufacturers choose to include that option			2
acting @entity36 administrator @entity35 ( right ) and transportation secretary @entity37 ( left ) announced the tracking program today the @entity36 , which has been working with automakers on the technology for the past decade , estimates vehicle - to - vehicle communications could prevent up to 80 percent of accidents that do n't involve drunken drivers or mechanical failure			1
' when these technologies are adapted across the fleet , the results could be nothing short of revolutionary for roadway safety , ' said @entity35 , acting administrator of the @entity8 's @entity36			1
the details of implementation are still unknown			0
mandating the use of technology once thought to be science - fiction will ' pave the way for market penetration of vehicle - to - vehicle safety applications , ' the @entity8 said in a statement			1
this ' @entity61 ' technology allows cars on the road to trade basic safety data , such as speed and position , at a rate of ten times per second			1
this exchange of information might help avoid or reduce the severity of 80 percent of crashes that occur when the driver is not impaired , @entity36 said			1
" think of all the everyday situations that this technology could help with ; when folks pull up to a four - way stop , driving behind a big truck or an suv that limits your visibility or even making a lane change and a car moves into your blind spot , " @entity3 transportation secretary @entity37 told a news conference			0
the tracking system , which allows other cars to communicate with your vehicle , could prevent gridlock like the kind seen here in @entity94 this data does not include personal details about the driver or vehicle , the @entity8 said			1
vehicles or a group of vehicles can be identified through a defined procedure ' only if there is a need to fix a safety problem			0
' the announcement comes as @entity36 finishes its analysis of data gathered during its year - long pilot program of @entity61 technology in @entity111 , @entity112			0
in that program , @entity3 officials and the @entity114 outfitted nearly 3,000 cars , trucks and buses with wireless devices that tracked other vehicles ' speed and location , and alerted drivers to congestion			2
those findings , as well as a preliminary estimate of the costs of this technology , will be published in coming weeks			0
an industry trade group aligned with auto manufacturers said it is willing to explore the idea but that a lot of questions remain			0
' many pieces of a large puzzle still need to fit together , ' said @entity137 , head of communications for the @entity139			0
' what remains to be addressed is security and privacy , along with consumer acceptance , affordability , achieving the critical mass to enable the " network effect " and establishment of the necessary legal and regulatory framework , ' she said			0
' automakers have invested significantly in safety technology and systems , and we will review today 's announcement and engage with @entity36 in next steps			0

@entity8 is working on the new rule right now
estimates that chips in cars could prevent up to 80 percent of accidents on the road
could also help drivers avoid traffic jams and prevent gridlock
