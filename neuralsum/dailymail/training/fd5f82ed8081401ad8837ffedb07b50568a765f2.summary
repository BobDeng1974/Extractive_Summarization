the @entity0 paid a sartorial nod to the icy weather that was creeping across @entity3 with her sunday worship outfit this morning			1
her majesty conjured up images of the @entity0 in the @entity8 fairy tale in her chic cream ensemble , complete with large fur hat and matching cuffs as she arrived at st. mary magdalene church for the 11am service			1
to ward off the chill , the royal also added a blue blanket to her layers during the short drive in her chauffeur - driven @entity19 across the @entity20			2
so instead , she attended @entity37 on the @entity20 estate a last minute change of plans had forced the @entity0 to change her sunday worship routine due to a health and safety hazard at the church she was scheduled to attend today , but she still saw the day through in perfect regal style			1
the royal was supposed to visit @entity47 church at @entity33 , slightly further away on the @entity20 estate , but the service was cancelled after a lump of plaster fell off the ceiling on @entity53			1
church officials decided it was too dangerous to admit members of the public because of the risk of more plaster falling and injuring someone			1
so , instead of journeying three miles to @entity33 , the @entity0 , 88 , was chauffeured in a @entity19 to st. mary magdalene church instead , which is around 400 yards from @entity20 , for the sunday morning service			1
the @entity63 braved the cold and walked to the church for the service			2
he appeared to say something to the police officer who saluted him as he walked past on the way to @entity37 this morning the pair seem to have cracked a joke , as they pass each other in high spirits her husband @entity63 , 93 , decided to brave the elements by walking to join her at church in the winter sunshine , wearing his trademark long brown coat			1
@entity33 church warden @entity84 , 64 , admitted that locals had been disappointed not to be hosting the @entity0 at their church this weekend			1
he said : ' we had a bit of plaster fall on the pulpit on @entity53			0
it was not really a big deal - it was really just a dustpan and brush job to clear up			0
' but it was decided that we could not hold our service on the first sunday of the month or the one this sunday , in case something else happened			0
' the plaster certainly did not fall in the area where the @entity0 normally sits , but it was agreed that we should not take any risks			2
' it is a shame for @entity102 because people were looking forward to the queen visiting			0
we hope she will be able to come next year instead			0
' the @entity0 and prince @entity63 worship most sundays at @entity37 church during their festive break as well as on christmas day when they are joined by other members of the @entity112 on the third sunday in january , the 11am service which they attend is traditionally moved to one of four other churches in the area mr @entity84 said that scaffolding was due to be erected inside the church this week to allow a repair to be made			1
surveyors will also carry out an inspection to make sure that no other parts of the ceiling are in danger of collapse before officials agree to re-open the church			2
he said it was possible that the plaster collapse had happened because of a tile on the roof becoming dislodged more than two years ago , which may have then let in water			0
he said : ' the tile was repaired at the time , but a small amount of water may have entered			0
' the bit of plaster that fell away was directly below the tile so it may be linked			0
' it was only the plaster that fell , not the wood part of the ceiling			2
' the @entity0 complemented her wintry look with ruby red lipstick and a pair of elegant pearl earrings @entity143 heads back to her @entity19 after the church service this morning in @entity34 the @entity0 and prince @entity63 worship most sundays at @entity37 church during their festive break as well as on christmas day when they are joined by other members of the royal family			1
but on the third sunday in january , the 11am service which they attend is traditionally moved to one of four other churches in the area			0
the honour is usually given to a different church every year and on sunday it was due to be @entity102			0
a notice explaining the cancellation of the service and expressing ' great disappointment ' was posted on the church door .			0

@entity0 forced to cancel a visit to @entity32 church in @entity33
