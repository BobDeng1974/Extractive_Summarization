the @entity0 found himself up a creek without a paddle when he visited a floating farm on the first day of the royal tour of @entity5			1
instead of sitting in the flat - bottomed boat of the farm on the outskirts of @entity9 , prince @entity10 and a few members of his entourage had to stand precariously as they were punted across the water			1
@entity10 laughed as the boat sailed across the murky waters to the floating farm , called a @entity18 , waving his arms up and down as he enjoyed the wobbly experience			0
when he reached the plot of land he found farmers at work planting spinach in immaculate rows			0
not one to shy away from working the land , prince @entity10 , who started his @entity54 in the early 1980s , joined in with raking the soil and even planting spinaches			1
the rectangular plot of land was surrounded on all sides by water and is part of an agricultural system created 800 years ago from reclaimed swamp land that covered much of the area in and around @entity9			0
the @entity18 have been lost over the decades to the urban development of @entity5 's sprawling capital , but there are efforts to preserve the remaining sites whose produce - from tomatoes to radishes - are used to feed @entity9			0
meanwhile the @entity39 visited a human trafficking centre in the @entity5 capital , meeting officials and stopping for a cup of tea			1

earlier today @entity79 was left in tears of laughter after being shown a photo album			2
exactly what the album contained is unknown , although it is likely that the images showed prince @entity10 during one of his earlier visits to @entity5			2
@entity104 , who is famous for her sense of humour , was left chuckling after seeing her husband 's attempt at a @entity5 pasty - made during a visit to @entity112 's pasty museum			2
fresh from a successful four - day tour of @entity115 , @entity79 and husband @entity10 were making their first stop on the @entity5 leg of their journey in a town famous for its links with @entity123			1
entertaining : the @entity39 burst into laughter after being shown this photo album tears of laughter : @entity79 was left in tears of laughter after being shown a photo album welling up : quite which photo caused @entity79 to cry with laughter remains unknown amusing : @entity79 had spent the morning making a @entity5 pasty which swaps meat and potatoes for tomatoes and chilli how does that work then ? prince @entity10 gets entangled in his apron as the cooking session gets underway tasty : prince @entity10 , who is also the @entity139 , reveals how much he loves his home county 's baked goods although neither the @entity39 nor prince @entity10 are known for their cooking skills , both tried their hand at making @entity5 's take on the @entity146 , which swaps meat and potatoes for tomatoes , spices and a dash of salsa verde			1
hundreds of @entity154 miners travelled to the town to work in its silver mines during the 19th century , leaving a legacy that includes an appreciation for pasties and cream teas behind them			0
but it was the @entity5 version that left @entity79 smiling during the demonstration , although the very @entity165 duchess did toast her culinary efforts with a well - earned cup of tea			0
as they each took a circular piece of pastry , prince @entity10 asked cook and pasty expert @entity172 how much filling he should use , to which , in true @entity154 style , she replied : ' as much as you can ! ' @entity10 laughed as he put his effort down on the metal work surface but the @entity39 spent longer perfecting hers and finally handed it over with a smile			2
speaking after waving the couple off , ms @entity172 said : ' i think they did great - you do have to practice how to seal it			0
i do n't know if it 's the first time they did it but i think they did a great job and it looks like they had fun doing it , they really enjoyed themselves			0
' as well as their mining expertise , the @entity154 also brought football to @entity198 , which their new friends in @entity5 enthusiastically adopted as their own			0
how much filling ? prince @entity10 was fascinated by the pasty making process and asked for tips on how much filling to use better cook : @entity79 's neatly crimped pasty was the better of the two according to local chefs well - earned : the couple toast their pasty making efforts with a well - earned cup of tea celebrations : @entity10 and @entity79 had arrived in @entity213 in time to experience the country 's famous @entity216 festivities remembrance : the @entity216 is a major event in the @entity5 calendar when families pay tribute to loved ones who have died holiday : the royal couple were greeted with women in eleaborate dresses who painted their faces to look like skulls , as above festivities : the royal couple were greeted by a host of ghoulish figures as they flew in on the latest leg of their tour welcome committee : hundreds of members of the public cheer for the royal couple in @entity213 on the first day of their tour tradition : @entity10 and @entity79 joined celebrations in @entity112 ’s town centre where they saw traditional altars made to mark the occasion known as @entity247 many , however , never made it home and the @entity0 and the @entity39 visited a cemetery where many of the men are buried as part of the colourful @entity216 celebrations			1
the @entity216 , which sees women paint their faces as skulls , is a major event in the @entity5 calendar when families remember loved ones who have died and celebrate them			0
hundreds of residents packed the town ’s main square close to the cemetery where the royal couple admired a brightly - coloured shrine that had an enormous skull as its centrepiece			0
there they posed for photos with women dressed as @entity272 - skull faced characters in elaborate gowns who have come to symbolise the festival , which is known as @entity216 in @entity277			0
