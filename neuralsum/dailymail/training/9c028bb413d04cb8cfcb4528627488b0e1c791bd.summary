it was a job advert designed to find the best mathematical minds in the country by hiding a phone number inside a complicated numerical puzzle			1
but the @entity5 , which posted the ad , has been left red - faced after failing to spot a mistake in the numbers , therefore making the puzzle insolvable			1
the typos were eventually spotted by users of the website @entity11 and the formula has now been corrected			1
a job advert for an engineer at the @entity5 was meant to hide its recruitment phone number inside a maths puzzle			1
the first four terms shown in the formula added together give this number but the final terms should have then equaled zero			0
the two typos , highlighted , made the task impossible according to @entity26 ( @entity26 ) , the @entity25 recruiters got the formula from a @entity29 professor			0
@entity30 told the website that the formula was designed as a ' means of driving engagement , and not a formal test			0
' the site said : ' that ’s good , because the formula – which involves infinite sums , integrals , complicated trigonometry and imaginary numbers – does n’t produce the intended phone number			1
' reddit users solved the first four terms shown in the formula and added them together to get the @entity48 phone number of 131901			2
@entity49 has since corrected the formula on its website , pictured , by replacing sin 2 x with sin ( 2x ) in the third to last line , and ( 2k - 1 ) ! with ( 2k +1 ) ! in the penultimate line			0
@entity30 thanked the @entity11 members who spotted the mistake , adding : ' you are exactly the kind of people we 'd be looking for ' however , they discovered that the remaining terms were meant to equate to zero but two typos in the formula made this impossible			2
the incorrect formula showed ' sin to the power of two x ' when it should have read sin ( 2x )			0
to get zero in the penultimate line the formula should have said ( 2k +1 ) ! instead of ( 2k - 1 ) ! @entity49 has since corrected the formula and told @entity26 : ' our original formula included two small typos , which we have now fixed			2
' we hope people still enjoy the inherent fun and hidden challenges			0
' our thanks go to the eagle - eyed @entity11 users who spotted them first ; you are exactly the kind of people we ’d be looking for			1

the @entity83 @entity5 posted a job advert looking for a engineer
new recruits were told to solve a complicated maths puzzle to get the phone number needed to apply - yet the puzzle proved to be insolvable
the typos were spotted by @entity11 users and formula has been corrected
