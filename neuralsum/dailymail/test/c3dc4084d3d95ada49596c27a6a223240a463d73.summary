the light in these extraordinary images has travelled so far that it has taken 4,200 years to get here			0
but , despite the distance , scientists say the photographs reveal , like no others before them , the immense forces unleashed when a star is born			2
the two images were taken 18 years apart , the first with the @entity10 in @entity11 in 1996 and the second by an international team of astronomers led by the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) last year			1
this simulation shows how the outflow of material from the star has dramatically expanded as it takes shape			2
a simulated image from 1996 is on the left , and another from 2014 is on the right the star – known as @entity30 ( @entity29 ) - @entity31 – is 300 times brighter and eight times bigger than our sun , although it is masked by a black cloud of space dust			1
but what has most excited astronomers is the change in shape of the violet area of super-hot electrified winds that are being ejected by the young star			1
the dramatic changes , in a cosmic blink of an eye relative to the age of the universe , is giving an unprecedented look at how young ‘ protostars ’ develop into fully - fledged stars			1
the pictures , created by data from 27 radio telescope antennae in the @entity11 desert in the @entity57 , show the electrified wind expanding away from the star until it is slowed by the black and yellow cloud of dust surrounding it			1
these images of the star were taken by the � � @entity10 in @entity11			1
on the left is the star as seen in 1996 , with its dust wrapped tightly around it , while by 2014 in the image on the right , this outflow has been pushed out into an elongated shape this artist 's illustration shows the development of @entity30 ( @entity29 ) - @entity75			1
on the left , a hot wind from the young star expands nearly spherically , as seen in 1996			2
on the right right , as seen in 2014 , the hot wind has been shaped by encountering a dusty , doughnut - shaped torus around the star and appears elongated in the 1996 picture there is a relatively small region of space wind surrounding the star			1
but 18 years later that has expanded into a rugby - ball shape – because the dust has formed a doughnut shape around the star and offers less resistance to the space winds at its poles			2
astronomer @entity96 of the @entity15 , said : ‘ the comparison is remarkable			0
‘ we 're seeing this dramatic change in real time , so this object is providing us an exciting opportunity to watch over the next few years as a very young star goes through the early stages of its formation			2
’ the team will now continue to observe the star and see how it develops over the next few years			0
‘ our understanding of how massive young stars develop is much less complete than our understanding of how sun - like stars develop , ’ dr @entity96 said			2
‘ it 's going to be really great to be able to watch one as it changes			0
we expect to learn a lot from this object			0
' take a look at the amount of fuel for star formation in the universe , compared to the number of stars , and you 'll notice something strange - there should be 10 times as many stars as there are			1
it 's a problem that has perplexed scientists , but a study in early march claimed to have an answer , saying that the heat in star - forming clouds may be hindering stellar formation			0
they say that the temperatures are likely too hot to allow reasonable amounts of star formation , which leads to the lower number of stars we observe in the cosmos today			0
' the amount of fuel for star formation outpaces the amount of stars 10 times , so these clusters should be really star - rich , ' said dr @entity151 , a @entity152 fellow in @entity154 's ( @entity154 ) @entity153			1
' you really need some mechanism to prevent gas from cooling , otherwise the universe would have 10 times as many stars			0
' the theory proposed by the researchers from @entity154 and @entity162 suggests a number of reasons for why this is so			0
researchers say that for some galaxy clusters the intracluster gas may simply be too hot - on the order of hundreds of millions of degrees @entity170			0
even if one region experiences some cooling , the intensity of the surrounding heat would keep that region from cooling further - an effect known as conduction .			0

astronomers have used a telescope in @entity11 to watch a star form
named @entity30 ( @entity29 ) - @entity184 it is 300 times brighter than the sun
images from 1996 and 2014 show how it is beginning to take shape
it could provide unprecedented *insight* into how huge stars are born
