by @entity0 published : 11:13 est , 18 october 2012 updated : 16:50 est , 18 october 2012 police are investigating claims that a leading anti-terrorism officer enjoyed secret nights of passion in the home of maverick mp @entity7			1
according to the controversial politician , detective inspector @entity8 had an affair with mr @entity7 ’s aide @entity11			2
and he claims the pair conspired to run a ' dirty tricks ' campaign against him and his respect political party			1
' lovers ' : the picture said to show @entity19 with @entity21 officer detective inspector @entity8 @entity22 , a member of the @entity25 ’s elite @entity24 anti-terror squad , has been moved to ‘ restricted duties ’ while the matter is investigated			1
mr @entity7 has suspended miss @entity11 , 32 , a mother of one , from her post and police are believed to be seeking her to discuss the matter			2
a spokesman for the mp claimed last night that the pair ’s smear campaign included encouraging the @entity37 newspaper to run a lengthy piece claiming @entity39 was involved in political thuggery in @entity41 , where 58 - year - old mr @entity7 won a shock by - election victory over @entity44 in march			1
it was claimed that the couple slept at the mp ’s house in @entity48 , south @entity49 , while he was away in @entity50			1
as well as making a formal complaint to the police , the mp has tabled a motion in @entity54 calling on the home secretary to make a statement on the issue			1
mr @entity7 said he felt ‘ violated ’ by the events , and called for the officer to be sacked			1
' it could not look worse than that a person whose job is essentially to police @entity65 ’s @entity64 community could have been coming and going , sleeping in my house when i was away , when i am the mp for tens of thousands of @entity64 and heavily involved in issues that vitally affect the @entity64 community , ' he said			2
@entity7 , pictured with wife @entity70 , claimed the @entity25 officer had sex with his aide in his house while he was abroad ' if he could not see that then he is too stupid to be a detective inspector in @entity24			1
it is not enough for me that he has been placed on restrictive duties , which means counting pencils			2
' mr @entity7 ’s spokesman and associate for the last 36 years , @entity84 , said : ' @entity11 had become @entity7 ’s aide after turning up at the @entity39 headquarters in @entity87 before his election campaign			2
i think she used to be a teacher			0
' there was some concern that she had been involved with the @entity44			0
she worked for @entity7 in @entity87 and in @entity49 – and while he was away in @entity50 in june he gave her the keys to his house in @entity48			0
' a short while after @entity7 came back there was a break - in at his house when he , his wife and @entity11 were in , and the burglars made off with a parliamentary computer			0
' local police were investigating – but it was then that @entity11 introduced @entity8 to @entity7 as a police officer and security expert who could help him beef up his home security			1
' it transpired a few hours later that @entity22 had declared to the cops investigating the burglary that they would find his fingerprints in the house because he had been sleeping in the house with @entity11 while @entity7 was away			0
' that was @entity7 ’s rude introduction to what had been going on			0
@entity21 said the officer has been placed on restricted duties pending an investigation by the @entity117 ' since then @entity7 has been given incontrovertible evidence from emails that @entity22 had been using his @entity25 police email account and two fictitious accounts to communicate with her and use her as his agent to indulge in a dirty tricks campaign			1
' we also found @entity11 was the instigator of a @entity37 story criticising @entity39			0
we ’ve got the emails between her and the @entity37 and between her and @entity8			0
one email from his police account claims there was electoral fraud in @entity7 ’s by - election			2
' it ’s clear he was keeping a close eye on @entity7 in his constituency			0
' mr @entity7 ’s team supplied a picture said to show the couple together			0
miss @entity11 refused to comment on the allegations against her , while @entity142 could not be contacted			0
former @entity44 mp mr @entity7 is renowned for courting controversy over a long and flamboyant political career			2
days after his by - election victory in @entity87 , he took a fourth wife , @entity70 , who is 30 years his junior			0
only two months ago he was criticised for taking £ 80,000 a year from a tv station linked to @entity149 and @entity150 , and for using the insulting term ‘ window licker ’ against a disabled person on @entity153			0
in his parliamentary motion , he complains about ' the involvement of a very senior officer in @entity24 in an apparent dirty tricks operation against the @entity158 for @entity41 '			1
he claims : ' the officer , @entity8 , entered the @entity158 ’s @entity49 home without his knowledge or consent , the @entity158 never having met or heard of him , and he slept in the @entity158 ’s home			1
' and he adds : ' @entity8 sent emails to an individual in the @entity158 ’s office who acted as his agent and co-ordinated this operation from his police email account and from at least two other fake email accounts , duping , amongst others , the @entity37 newspaper as to his true identity			0
' the mp ’s motion also alleges that @entity142 used an alias to attack him on @entity176 and elsewhere , ' all the while concealing that he was a senior serving police officer at @entity21 ' .			1

respect mp claims the pair had sex in his home while he was abroad
