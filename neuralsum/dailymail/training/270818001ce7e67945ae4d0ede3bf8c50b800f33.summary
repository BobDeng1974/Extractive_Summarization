by @entity1 reporter poppy sellers are to be given ‘ minders ’ after the collectors were subject to a string of vile attacks last year			1
in an unprecedented move , teenage volunteers will be chaperoned as they raise money for the @entity10 in @entity11			1
last year there were a spate of assaults on those asking for the donations , which go to help the families of soldiers who have been injured or lost their lives			1
protection : the @entity22 collectors in @entity11 will now be chaperoned after a string of attacks three young collectors were attacked in @entity11 whilst raising money for the @entity22 - one of whom was just 13			1
this year the youngsters will be accompanied by older members of the @entity10 and ex @entity31			1
the @entity33 is also going into at least one local school to talk to youngsters about the need to honour the fallen and overcome cultural barriers			2
army cadet @entity38 , then 13 , was one of those attacked last year			1
she was spat at three times while collecting for the first time			2
her mum @entity42 , 43 , a teaching assistant , said : ‘ she gave up her whole day and raised quite a bit of money			2
appeal : three young collectors have been attacked in @entity11 while raising money for the @entity10 ‘ she was not in uniform because she had only just become old enough to join the cadets but was with another lad who was in uniform			1
‘ three @entity53 boys who were younger than her - about 11 or 12 - came up while she was stood outside a shopping centre			1
‘ one of them pinched a poppy from the box , turned his back to her , and spat on it unknown to her			2
’ @entity64 ordered the boys to return the poppy and was appalled when she realised what they had done			0
‘ then he tried to spit on another poppy and when she grabbed him he spat in her face , ’ added mother - of - two mrs @entity38			2
‘ she was very upset by what happened at the time and we got a letter from the @entity10 saying how sorry they were - and how horrified			1
‘ she was out there from 9.30 in the morning until five o’clock and this was her reward			0
‘ it happened 15 minutes before i came to pick her up			0
‘ so i think providing chaperones is a good idea - but it is also a sad sign of the times			0
’ the incident was reported to police but mrs @entity38 said none of the yobs was ever traced			0
mrs @entity38 works a multi-cultural school - @entity92 in @entity11 - and said the @entity33 was coming in to explain the importance of @entity94			0
‘ they will be giving a talk explaining that everyone was involved in the war and the boys should appreciate that and be respectful , ’ she said			0
as a result the local branch of the @entity10 has accepted an offer to provide personal protection to its younger collectors			1
@entity64 , now 14 , has now put the incident behind her and is determined to do her bit for @entity108			0
‘ i just do n’t want any fuss , ’ she said yesterday			0
it might be a good idea but i do not want this			0
’ in separate incidents last year yobs also hurled abuse at two @entity53 girl cadets and two other sellers were sworn at in the city centre			1
one young poppy seller had her tin grabbed from her shoulder			0
grandmother @entity122 , @entity22 organiser for the @entity125 branch for 13 years , said it had never happened before			2
fears that young collectors , aged from ten to 17 , could be too frightened to take part this year prompted the @entity10 ’s riders branch to offer their services as chaperones			1
the riders is a branch of the @entity10 and was set up in 2004			1
concerned : the @entity10 now fears young collectors will be put off its members are all ex-forces motorcycle enthusiasts who wanted to support the poppy appeal and include riders of all ages from youth members to veterans in their 80s			1
the @entity145 branch of the riders will follow the youngsters around during their collections			2
mrs @entity122 said : ‘ it is something we need and it ’s ideal because it would keep the cadets safe			0
’ riders @entity145 official @entity154 said : ‘ after what happened last year we thought our job should be to support the branches			2
‘ you have to remember the cadets who are affected by this are very impressionable and in some cases they will turn out to be our future armed forces			1
‘ we have to educate the public why we are doing these collections			0
’ lord mayor of @entity11 @entity167 said it was a ‘ sad reflection ’ that some youngsters were targeted by mindless thugs last year			1
‘ there are numerous events on november 11 to commemorate the fallen , ’ he said			0
‘ we are strong supporters of the appeal			0
' it deals with the past and present generations of service men and women who are always in our minds			0
‘ it is very important the younger generation are continually reminded - and it is a sad reflection that this small minority did abuse some of the younger collectors last year			2
‘ i welcome that the motorcycle section will be keeping a watchful eye - but hope their services will not be needed			0

one , a 13 year old girl , was spat at while she stood outside a shopping centre
now the youngsters will be accompanied by older members of the @entity10 and ex armed forces
