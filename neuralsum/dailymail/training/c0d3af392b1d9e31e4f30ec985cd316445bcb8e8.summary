@entity7 was only 16 when he started illegally streaming @entity8 matches to a website he set up , and undercutting prices charged by official broadcaster , @entity12			1
he used a huge satellite dish , seven computers and nine satellite decoders to run the ' freelivefooty ' website from his home in @entity18 , near @entity19			1
reading @entity20 : judge @entity21 gave @entity7 , now 24 , a suspended prison sentence thousands of viewers worldwide were believed to have tuned in to the illegal website , paying through a @entity26 online account set up by an accomplice			1
today , in a court case described by copyright enforcers as ' groundbreaking ' , @entity7 , who is now 24 , was convicted of his illegal soccer streaming and given a suspended prison sentence			1
sitting at @entity34 , judge @entity21 heard that prosecutors were unable to establish how much financial damage the operation caused the broadcaster			0
his accomplice , @entity39 , allowed his @entity41 account to be used by @entity7 to process some of the money the enterprise brought in			1
both @entity39 and @entity7 , who met for the first time at court , were convicted by a jury after a trial			1
judge @entity21 told @entity7 : ' companies in this country , such as the broadcasters in this , and the @entity8 , are entitled to their copyright and entitled not to have other people using it illegally , as you did			1
premises : @entity7 used to run his business from his home in @entity18 near @entity19 ' the trouble is that ultimately in cases like this it will be the consumer that ends up paying because if there are less people using it then the prices have to go up			1
' the fact , i 'm told , that there are a number of other websites and enterprises conducting the same illegal operations , does not help you			0
' if anything it calls for the courts to impose deterrent sentences			0
' the @entity81 ( @entity81 ) launched an investigation on behalf of the @entity8 and supplied evidence to the @entity84 , who arrested @entity7 and @entity39 in november 2010			1
' this is a ground - breaking case , proving conclusively that operating a website that rebroadcasts copyrighted works without permission is a criminal offence			0
' @entity91 , @entity81 they sent a number of ' cease and desist ' notices to the website on behalf of the @entity8 but @entity7 's activities continued			1
investigations showed that @entity39 had processed the money through his @entity41 account , and both men were subsequently charged on june 27 2011			2

@entity91 , fact director general , said : ' this is a groundbreaking case , proving conclusively that operating a website that rebroadcasts copyrighted works without permission is a criminal offence			0
' detective constable @entity116 , from @entity117 's @entity84 , said : ' @entity7 is believed to have made tens of thousands of pounds through illegally streaming football matches to subscribers to his website , although no exact figure is available due to the complexity of the investigation			1
' @entity124 , defending @entity7 , said in mitigation : ' it is very difficult to know if people would have subscribed to @entity12 rather than freelivefooty.com but at the time of these offences @entity12 was not available online anyway			2
' i accept they could have subscribed to @entity12 on the television			0
' official broadcasters : @entity7 undercut @entity12 when he illegally streamed the football matches ( file picture ) he said his client 's service had also streamed matches that were not available on @entity12 , adding : ' so it is difficult to know if @entity12 lost anything			1
' mr @entity124 went on : ' this website started in 2005 when he was only 16 and even when he was arrested he was only 20 years old			0
' he is a young man and he has acted naively and that is how he should be treated			0
' he said @entity7 was currently working as a mechanic			0
@entity144 , defending @entity39 , told the judge : ' he had nothing to do with the computing , the streaming , the running of the website , the setting up of the website , the administration of the website			2
' he only became involved in november 2009 and his @entity41 account was stopped in august 2010 and the website continued with subscriptions			0
' so it was running long before he got involved and was running after he stopped			0
' he said his client had not tried to hide his identity but had allowed his account , his girlfriend 's and his father 's accounts to be used despite suspecting that something was not right			0
' i bear in mind you were only 16 years old when you started this enterprise and are still relatively young			0
' judge @entity21 to defendant @entity7 some £ 26,000 passed through his account although he was only left with around £ 3,000 , from which various bills also had to be paid			2
when mr @entity144 told the judge that the latest @entity12 worldwide football rights package had been sold for £ 5.6bn , meaning his client 's actions had little impact , the judge replied : ' i 'm not sure that 's a good argument because if other people are doing it , a deterrent sentence should be imposed			2
' the judge told @entity7 : ' i bear in mind you were only 16 years old when you started this enterprise and are still relatively young			2
' i have no doubt at all that you were soon aware that what you were doing was illegal and ignored correspondence that pointed out to you that what you were doing was illegal			0
you carried on and you made not vast profits but some significant gain			0
' he passed a six - month jail term , suspended for two years , and ordered him to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work and pay £ 1,750 towards the prosecution costs			1
he also ordered that all of the equipment used to run the website be forfeited			0
the judge then told @entity39 : ' i do accept that your role was very subsidiary but you did allow your @entity41 account to be used for subscribers to make payments			2
' despite your suspicions you continued to provide the account to be used for it and a considerable amount of money did pass through it , from which you were paid some relatively small amount			0
' he ordered @entity39 to carry out 140 hours of unpaid work and pay £ 500 pounds towards the prosecution costs .			1
