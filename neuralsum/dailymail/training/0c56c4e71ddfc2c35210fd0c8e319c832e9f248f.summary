sat in a luxurious meeting room in a hotel in downtown @entity3 , @entity0 was talking about the past , the present and the future			1
it was july 27 , @entity5 had just breezed past @entity6 in a pre-season friendly			1
after @entity0 had dealt with the thorny issue of what happened during the title run - in last april , then discussed what would happen in the post @entity14 era , the conversation turned to @entity16			2
his old @entity18 colleague had just decided to embark on a fresh challenge in the @entity20 and it was put to @entity0 whether he could ever envisage a life beyond @entity5			1
@entity0 has only ever played for @entity5 , winning the @entity25 in @entity26 in 2005 @entity0 has been an inspirational captain for more than a decade , leading the team since 2003 @entity0 was instrumental in his sides run to the @entity25 final in 2005 to win their fifth @entity31 title ‘ at his age of 36 , he ’s had a wonderful career and i do n’t think he has anything to prove in @entity18 anymore , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ he ’s broken records with @entity38 and won everything with them			0
i think it ’s a perfect move for him at his time			0
one day that might happen to me , i do n’t know			0
‘ i ’ve never really discussed it with anyone or thought about it			0
maybe one day i would like the chance to go away from @entity5 for a short time and try something different			2
but i have n’t given it much thought			0
that carrot has n’t been dangled yet			0
’ now it has and it has prompted @entity0 to make a heart - rending decision			2
from may 23 , @entity5 will no longer have their talismanic no 8 to turn to			1
there was always going to be a day when @entity5 and @entity0 were no more but , even still , the news takes some getting used to			1
like @entity60 ( left ) @entity0 's departure will leave a void that is impossible to fill @entity5 now have a job to do replacing two club legends who will leave within two years of each other @entity0 has been offered a new deal by his club , but will not sign a deal beyond the end of the season @entity0 was man of the match in the 2006 fa cup final , scoring twice to help @entity5 lift the trophy @entity0 fast established himself as a fans favourite and has stayed with @entity5 for 17 years there has been a lot of noise this season about @entity0 , his form and whether he can still contribute in the @entity79			1
he might not be the rampaging force of nature who , 10 years ago , inspired that night in @entity26 but his role runs deeper than what happens on the pitch			0
@entity0 , along with @entity60 , provided the heart and soul to @entity5 during countless changes since the turn of the @entity90 and has always been on hand to say or do the right thing at the right time			1
they had been the link between the terrace and the squad			0
@entity60 has never been adequately replaced in the 18 months since his retirement but if manager @entity99 had a hard job looking for a new no 23 , he is now faced with an impossible challenge to find someone who will adequately fill that no 8 jersey			2
@entity0 has never won the @entity79 title , coming closest last season when @entity5 fell just short since making his @entity5 debut in 1998 @entity0 has played almost 500 league games for the club this decision is something @entity0 has been wrestling with for months , the excitement of pursuing a new challenge somewhere else always being counterbalanced by the love and affinity he has for @entity5 , the club he grew up dreaming he would one day represent			1
he will not want the next five months to become overly nostalgic and he will be committed to helping @entity5 obtain their highest possible finish in the @entity79 , while hoping that , perhaps , there will be one final day at @entity118			2
once the end of may arrives , though , that will be it			0
and @entity5 will never be the same again .			0

@entity0 *confirms* he will leave @entity5 at the end of this season
@entity0 has been a *key* player since his debut in 1998
replacing the talismanic captain will be an impossible job for the club
