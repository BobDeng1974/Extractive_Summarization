read the full match report from the @entity3 men 's final in @entity4 @entity5 allowed himself to be mugged in this @entity3 final			1
he knows it , and so does @entity8			1
the angry cracking of two rackets back at his chair after a cursory handshake at the net spoke more articulately than the @entity16 ’s more measured reflections after a shattering defeat by his long - time rival			1
the smashing of his implements was a way of expressing what he felt about getting distracted by @entity8 ’s oscar - contending displays of frailty			1
@entity5 loses his cool during the 7 - 6 , 6 - 7 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 0 defeat to @entity8 in @entity4 the @entity31 no 1 won only 34 per cent of points on his weak second serve in the final @entity5 looks on as world no 1 @entity8 gives his winner 's speech ‘ i play enough matches to be able to handle that situation better , ’ he admitted			1
but while the wildly undulating physical demeanour of the champion is what will be remembered about this encounter , there were more prosaic reasons for the result			2
a continuing problem for @entity5 is his second serve , which still requires a protection order to be slapped on it			1
he may have varied it better at this event but it is still too vulnerable			0
@entity8 won 62 per cent of his second serves to @entity5 ’s 34 per cent , but it was 15mph faster			1
more startlingly , the 83mph average of the @entity5 second delivery in the final was 10mph slower than @entity57 and 12mph slower than @entity58 managed in the women ’s final			1
@entity5 seemed distracted by @entity8 's requests for medical attention during the game @entity5 's fiancee @entity63 looks up at the big screen in @entity4 after they notice her choice of top the former @entity69 champion takes his frustration out on a pair of rackets former @entity69 champion @entity73 has accused @entity5 of losing the plot he lacked the same ruthlessness as @entity8 , particularly in the way he allowed himself to become distracted by the drama at the other end of the court as his opponent went through his physical troughs			1
you see this kind of thing happening more commonly in junior tennis , one player being befuddled by another ’s struggles			0
more profoundly , you have to take your chances when they present themselves against the best			0
@entity5 could have won all three sets , having been 4 - 2 up in the first tiebreak and 2 - 0 up in the third set , which was the time when the hammer had to come down			1
yet in comparing him with @entity8 , we are judging him by stratospheric standards , and that should not be overlooked			2
indeed , it is possible that the unfolding story of this year in men ’s tennis will be whether anybody can mount a credible challenge to the 27 - year - old , whose game is near impenetrable			0
@entity8 gives @entity5 a backwards glance as he holds the @entity3 winner 's trophy the @entity16 tries not to watch as @entity8 kisses the trophy after his four set victory djokovic and his team , including coach @entity113 ( right ) , celebrate in the locker room if there is a volunteer for the role it might turn out to be @entity5 , seeing the improvements that he has come up with since returning from the off - season			1
taken as a whole , his form here has been immensely encouraging , a swift turnaround after the shambolic way he ended last year with an embarrassing defeat by @entity127 and abrupt changes in his coaching team			0
he played impressively in the lead - up during some competitive exhibitions , and then showed that was no mirage in particularly outstanding performances to beat @entity135 and @entity136			0
the necessary aggression was there to see			0
@entity5 lost his way after winning the second set and going 2 - 0 up in the third set @entity5 screams as he comes up short in the sixth grand slam final of his career the @entity16 's coach @entity144 accepts that her charge 's performance was not good enough while the 6 - 0 scoreline in sunday 's final set looks ugly , it was apparent that whoever won the third set could romp away with it			1
the damage was done then , and that is what will keep @entity5 awake on the flight back to @entity155			2
coach @entity144 ’s reaction later deserves as much weight as that from scathing @entity160 commentators such as @entity73 and @entity161			2
‘ it was n’t enough , it is not yet enough , ’ she said			0
‘ you can see @entity8 produced his best play at the important moments			2
@entity8 served really well — better than @entity5			1
the two things made the difference			0
these are two really good weeks compared to the end of last year , but to beat @entity8 , who is superb , it is not yet enough			2
‘ we have already made important progress — the little things are still to be worked on			0
there is not a lot of frustration			0
it is really a step forward			0
there remains a big one to make and we are going to try to do it			0
‘ the improvement he has made since the end of last year and then the first month and first @entity183 is really positive			0
we will all look back on where he has come from to where he is at now			0
still there are a few steps to climb before holding a @entity183 trophy again , but the gap is closing			0
’ the new rankings will back up that assertion , with @entity5 up from no 6 to no 4 in the world			2
he is in familiar company , with the trinity of @entity8 , @entity195 and @entity127			2
but after an @entity3 that always had swirling undercurrents of acrimony , @entity8 is in a group of one right now			1
a security guard carries away a protestor who ran on court during the men 's final @entity5 tries to come to terms with defeat in a press conference after the game @entity8 will take some beating in 2015 after winning the @entity3 for a fifth time			1
