by @entity0 for @entity1 a stunned @entity2 was at a loss to explain her crushing first round @entity6 defeat after a summer which had promised a decent run at the year 's final @entity9			1
as it was the 22 - year - old @entity10 lasted just 54 minutes of the morning session before going down 6 - 1 6 - 1 to world number 81 @entity14 of @entity15 , who she had beaten three times before			1
@entity2 served eight double faults and won only three points on her second serve as she heavily punished by @entity14 , who played way above expectations after winning just one match since @entity22			1
earlier this month she beat @entity38 runner - up @entity39 , but that kind of form was completely absent			0
' i did n't expect to play like this , ' said @entity2 , who at one point shouted out ' it ca n't get much worse ! ' as she lost eleven of the last twelve games			1
' she has n't been in good form and i 've been having a good run and playing well in practice			0
i 've got to try and make sure this does n't affect me going forward			0
' despite winning the junior title in 2009 @entity2 has yet to win a senior match at @entity53 after four attempts			2
the only consolation is that @entity2 has no ranking points to defend from last year for the rest of this season , and she will shortly embark on a series of four tournaments in @entity61 starting in @entity62			0
campaign over : @entity2 was heard to say during the match , ' it ca n't get much worse than this ' it 's not too late to play @entity67 … there 's £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest scoring manager			2
