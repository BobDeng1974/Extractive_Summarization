@entity0 vowed to end casual employment contracts yesterday but his crackdown backfired spectacularly as he forgot @entity3 use them @entity0 was accused of hypocrisy last night after @entity3 town halls and mps were revealed to be hiring thousands of workers on zero - hours contracts			1
the @entity3 leader yesterday vowed to end casual employment contracts that ‘ undermine living standards and family life ’			1
but his crackdown , which was intended to regain the political initiative after boosts for the @entity16 on jobs and incomes , backfired spectacularly			2
in a disastrous day for @entity3 ’s general election hopes : speaking in @entity20 , mr @entity0 said a @entity3 government would legislate to require employers to offer a contract to anyone who had been working regular hours for 12 weeks			1
he made a stinging attack on both @entity26 and firms that use ‘ exploitative ’ contracts which fail to guarantee minimum hours of work			2
but , far from being the preserve of business , the contracts are being routinely used by charities , the public sector and the @entity3 itself			2
it emerged that 68 @entity42 had also signed up researchers and other staff on zero - hour contracts in the last two years including shadow health secretary @entity46 ( right ) and shadow chancellor @entity47 ( left ) freedom of information requests circulated by the @entity32 reveal that @entity3 councils are behind 21,798 zero - hours contracts			1
in december last year , the director of finance at @entity53 admitted to still having 300 relief workers on their books			0
among the worst authorities are @entity57 , which had 738 staff on zero - hours contracts as of may 2014 ; @entity60 with 442 as of september 2014 ; and @entity61 with 278 as of january 2015			1
in an even greater embarrassment , it emerged that 68 @entity42 had also signed up researchers and other staff on the deals over the past two years			2
they included shadow health secretary @entity46 , shadow chancellor @entity47 , mr @entity0 ’s parliamentary bag carrier @entity66 and his election supremo @entity68			1
the @entity3 politicians said they had been told by the parliamentary expenses watchdog to use the contracts in order to pay a living wage			0
freedom of information requests found 22,000 zero - hours contracts were handed out by @entity3 - run councils , including @entity53 ( pictured ) where mr @entity0 is standing for mp @entity32 chairman @entity78 said : ‘ it ’s the same old hypocrisy from @entity0			1
' on the day he generates a load of hot air about zero - hours contracts it emerges that his party is one of the most prolific users of them			1
‘ it ’s chaos in the @entity3 that would cause chaos for the country			2
@entity0 ’s not up to the job because he says one thing and does another			0
a hung parliament could send financial markets into a tailspin and the pound and shares crashing , experts warned last night			0
@entity98 has already fallen nearly 5 per cent against the @entity100 dollar in the past five weeks amid jitters about the outcome of the @entity103			0
@entity104 of @entity105 said : ‘ the 2015 general election is set to be the most unpredictable for nearly a century			0
there may be no good outcome for investors			0
’ @entity110 , of stockbroker @entity111 , said : ‘ markets are incapable of dealing with uncertainty			0
’ ' if you ca n’t trust him on the basics you ca n’t trust him to lead the country			0
’ conservative candidate @entity117 added : ‘ this is total hypocrisy from @entity0			2
' @entity3 did nothing about zero - hours contracts during its 13 years in power , and now we learn that @entity42 and councils use them routinely			1
’ the spotlight was also turned on a number of startling claims made by mr @entity0 yesterday – whose speech worsened already bad relations with big business			1
his suggestion that @entity132 has an ‘ epidemic ’ of zero hours contracts was rubbished by official statistics from the @entity136			2
the @entity136 had explicitly warned the 697,000 people who reported having a zero - hours contract between october and december 2014 should not be compared with the 586,000 in the previous year			2
the @entity132 ’s official statistician said : ‘ it is not possible to say how much of this increase is due to greater recognition of the term zero - hours contracts rather than new contracts			1
’ however , mr @entity0 still made the claim the centre - piece of his headline grabbing announcement yesterday			1
the organisation @entity150 said the @entity152 ’s claims were unjustified			0
the @entity16 say they have tightened the law to end abuse of zero - hours			1
employers can no longer insist on ‘ exclusivity ’ deals which ban staff from working for other firms			2
last week @entity26 said he could not live on an ‘ exploitative zero - hours contract ’			2
@entity3 mp @entity66 ( left ) and mr @entity0 's election supremo @entity68 ( right ) also use zero - hours chancellor @entity162 made similar comments last night , saying : ‘ of course it would be very difficult … there are some zero - hour contracts that people want			1
’ @entity168 of the @entity169 said @entity3 ’s plans ‘ go too far ’			2
@entity171 , associate at the law firm @entity173 , said : ‘ to many this will seem an eye - catching and attractive policy with @entity0 championing workers rights over capitalist employers who are putting profit above workers ’ welfare			1
the risk , however , is that this proposal goes too far and would endanger the continued economic recovery			0
‘ in reality , employers may well choose to dismiss workers before they reach 12 weeks or be reluctant to offer work in the first place			0
' @entity0 ’s proposal would potentially undermine job creation , jeopardise zero - hours workers ’ current jobs and increase their insecurity			1
’ yesterday , opening up yet another front in his war on business , @entity0 pledged a @entity201 would ‘ end the exploitation of zero - hours contracts ’			1
@entity204 sorts the @entity152 ’s emotive claims about the contracts from the very different reality			0
@entity208 : we have an epidemic of zero - hours contracts in our country			1
reality : according to the @entity136 , between october and december last year a total of 697,000 people said they were employed on zero - hours contracts in their main job			1
this represents only 2.3 per cent of people in employment – or one in every 43 workers			0
this hardly constitutes an epidemic			0
@entity208 : there has been a 20 per cent increase in the last year alone			0
reality : it is true the number of people reporting they were on a zero - hours contract rose by 110,000 in the year to december 2014 , but the @entity136 says the two sets of figures are not comparable			0
in some cases , they will have been on the contracts for years but only just become aware of the fact … because @entity0 had spent so much time talking about them			0
@entity3 was warned by statisticians not to use the figures – but carried on regardless			0
@entity208 : zero - hours contracts ‘ undermine hard work , undermining living standards , undermining family life			1
’ reality : far from inflicting untold misery on the majority of workers , by making it impossible for them to make ends meet , 66 per cent said they did not want to work more hours			0
only one in ten on zero - hours contracts said they would like a different job			1
the average number of hours worked was 22.6 per week			0
almost one in five were in full - time education , which would make it hard for them to work any more hours even if they wished to			0
@entity208 : the @entity16 wo n’t end the exploitation of zero - hours contracts			1
reality : last june the @entity32 - led government took action to ban so - called exclusivity deals which prevented people on zero - hours contracts from working elsewhere			1
@entity3 ’s record , by contrast , is nothing to boast about : @entity269 promised in 1995 to ban them after it emerged they were used in @entity132 fast food chains but his government failed to act in three terms in power			0
@entity208 : if it ’s not good enough for us , it ’s not good enough for you			0
reality : mr @entity0 said he could not survive on one of the contracts – but plenty employed by @entity3 councils and officials have to do so			1
some 68 @entity3 mps are reported to have employed staff on the contracts over the last two years , including @entity47 , mr @entity0 ’s parliamentary bag carrier @entity66 and his election chief @entity68			1
meanwhile , @entity291 requests show @entity3 - run town halls are responsible for 21,798 of the contracts – including 300 in @entity53 , where the @entity3 leader is seeking re-election as the local mp			1
@entity208 : the conservatives believe by looking after a few big firms and individuals at the top , everyone else will be ok			0
reality : it ’s by no means only big business that appreciates the flexibility the contracts can provide			0
a survey of employers by the @entity308 found that a third of voluntary sector organisations used zero - hours contracts , along with a quarter of public sector employers			1
the figure for private firms – once again the target for an attack by mr @entity0 – was only 17 per cent			2
@entity317 : even the ever - meddling @entity318 does not object to zero - hours contracts			2
despite intense lobbying by @entity321 and the party ’s trade union paymasters , @entity319 has opted to stay out of the row			0
it insists only that workers should not work more hours than permitted by the @entity327 and should be entitled to any holiday rights they have accrued .			0
