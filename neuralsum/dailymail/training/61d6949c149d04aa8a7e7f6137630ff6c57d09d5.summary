by @entity0 @entity1 lingered by the touchline , his hand theatrically cupped to his ear as the boos and jeers came tumbling from the main stand at @entity8			1
he attempted a mocking smile but he could not disguise his confusion			1
it was a curiously compelling image			1
a few moments earlier , @entity12 had completed a fortuitous win over a @entity16 side which had played for more than an hour with 10 men			1
but a win is a win , three points are three points			1
as the perplexed manager put it : ‘ i ’ve never been in a place where we have won and got booed			1
i could n’t believe it			1
’ it was a pity that he was n’t around to hear the call which a gentleman named @entity30 made to @entity31 shortly afterwards			1
@entity30 , it seems , has been a @entity12 season - ticket holder for more than 30 years			1
he sounded informed , reasonable and thoroughly exasperated			1
ca n't hear you : @entity1 was booed despite @entity12 beating @entity16 on wednesday on the up : @entity36 scored the opening goal against @entity16 as they pulled clear of the relegation zone he acknowledged that , as a @entity12 fan , he did n’t expect to win titles or trophies			1
but he did expect something better than this			1
‘ it ’s just the turgidness of the performance , ’ he said			1
‘ it ’s £ 42 to get into each game , sometimes more , depending on the opposition , and it ’s just boring			1
this is the most turgid , boring side			2
if i was n’t a @entity12 supporter and you gave me a ticket , i would n’t watch it			1
it ’s so one - dimensional			2
it ’s just awful to watch			2
’ he appreciated that there are only so many good players to go around the @entity59 game			2
but he explained : ‘ if you ca n’t get your head up and buy yourself a little bit of time , if you have n’t got the quality to do that and play simple 10 - yard passes , if the only thing you ’ve got is a smash - up ball to @entity69 , well ... ! and you want me to pay £ 42 to watch it ! ’ there is a patronising assumption that football fans are unconcerned with frivolous qualities such as touch , technique and imagination			1
they want grafters , scrappers , uncomplicated battlers			2
and certainly it is much easier to hire muscular journeymen than to develop creative artists			2
and yet , when they are offered something more adventurous , more demanding , they may react with enthusiastic approval			2
consider the work done by @entity91 at @entity92 and now @entity93			2
or the way in which @entity94 operated at @entity92 and now @entity97			2
or the influence of @entity99 at @entity100			2
not one of these men could have tolerated the kind of scowling , intimidating sides which @entity1 churned out at @entity106 , briefly at @entity107 , at @entity108 and now at @entity12			1
@entity109 : @entity99 ( left ) at @entity100 and @entity94 ( right ) at @entity97 are more adventurous exciting : @entity97 have passed their way into fifth place and a possible spot in the @entity113 in truth , at each place he found a degree of approval , especially in the early days			2
but as time went on , his joyless pragmatism provoked precisely the same kind of reaction which @entity30 articulated the other evening			2
yet disapproval will scarcely dent @entity1 ’s self - esteem			1
this , after all , is the man who criticised the influence of foreign managers on the @entity59 scene and famously declared that he would have been offered the @entity131 job if his name had been ‘ @entity133 ’			2
equally celebrated was his contention that he was n’t much suited to the likes of @entity106 or @entity108			2
‘ i would be more suited to @entity136 or @entity137 , ’ he mused			0
‘ it would n’t be a problem for me to manage those clubs because i would win the @entity141 or the league every time			0
give me @entity144 or @entity145 and i would do the same			0
it would n’t be a problem			0
’ and even as we mocked his shameless self - delusion , we marvelled at his ability to persuade people to offer him lucrative employment , equip him with a handsome transfer budget and entrust him with the future of their football club			0
not pretty : @entity1 spent £ 15million on @entity69 which is why we find the man who paid £ 15million for @entity69 pacing the dugout at @entity8 , watching the ball being battered high and hopeful , occasionally stepping on a sign which proclaims the place : ‘ @entity163 ’			1
the boos and jeers are growing louder as the prevailing ugliness is emphatically rejected but @entity1 can not comprehend , much less sympathise with , the disapproval			1
for in his world , ends justify means			0
or , as he has frequently observed : ‘ we are in a results business			0
’ it is an unthinking cliché			0
it is also quite mistaken			0
the @entity174 is a ‘ results business ’ , likewise the @entity176			0
football is something quite different			0
its appeal was defined most beautifully by a dreamer named @entity181			0
‘ the game is about glory , ’ he said			0
‘ it is about doing things in style , with a flourish , about going out and beating the other lot , not waiting for them to die of boredom			0
’ in a couple of sentences , @entity181 distilled all the charm , the wonder , the timeless appeal of the game he loved so well			0
i can imagine @entity1 listening to those words with his hand cupped to his ear ; smiling his mocking smile , and failing to conceal his abject confusion			1
@entity203 pompous and blinkered to the bitter end on thursday , september 18 , the members of the @entity206 may decide to admit women to their ranks			1
in the year of grace 2014 , that opening sentence seems a ludicrous anachronism			0
but when @entity213 , the chief executive of the @entity203 , can commend the move by reflecting that ‘ society is changing , sport is changing ’ , then truly we are living in revolutionary times			1
if club ties and brass - buttoned blazers could speak , then they would sound just like @entity213			0
for year after year he has defended the exclusion of women by mumbling the same , fatuous mantra : ‘ there ’s no particular pressure from inside golf about this but the media clearly have it on their agenda			0
it ’s not an issue people talk to me about very much			0
’ in short , it is just a conspiracy of ‘ the chattering classes ’			0
progress : @entity213 has commended the move to allow women into the @entity203 so the @entity203 continued their 260 - year - old custom of denying membership to more than half the population of the planet , while awarding the @entity246 to clubs — @entity248 , @entity249 , @entity250 ’s — who operate the same indefensible policy			1
so what has brought about this tectonic shift ? we may discount considerations such as conscience , morality and an awareness of their own absurdity			0
no , they have been pushed by commercial and political pressures , as well as the powerful @entity266 movement , which recently adopted golf as an @entity266 sport and now requires it to behave in a civilised manner			0
regrettably , neither the @entity203 nor its chief executive are quite ready to embrace the 21st century			1
@entity213 refuses to give an assurance that men - only clubs will never again stage an @entity246			0
and , astonishingly , he is allowing the members ’ vote to clash with the @entity278 independence referendum			0
he explains : ‘ it is enshrined in our constitution that the business meeting takes place the day before the last day of @entity284 week			0
’ it is unwittingly hilarious , a classic case of blinkered pomposity			0
quite frankly , the women ca n’t get there soon enough			0
@entity290 @entity291 coaches @entity293 club			1
on sunday they visit @entity107 for an @entity296 match			0
@entity293 have had a difficult season but is their coach downhearted ? not at all			1
‘ despite being 12 points adrift at the foot of the table , i feel we ’re in a good place , ’ he declares			0
@entity293 may yet survive but , even if the worst happens , then mr @entity291 should not worry			1
instead , he should look beyond the oval - ball game			0
a coach capable of delivering a line like that would stroll into any job the @entity310 has to offer .			1

*disgruntled* @entity12 fans will not affect @entity1
regrettably , neither the @entity203 nor its chief executive are quite ready to embrace the 21st century
@entity293 coach @entity291 is the pinnacle of positivity
