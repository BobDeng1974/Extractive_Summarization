by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 objecting to the referee only four days before the biggest fight in post-war @entity4 is just the latest quirk from @entity6 and he will enjoy the war of nerves even though his appeal failed			1
@entity6 , who will exchange grudge - laden championship blows with @entity11 at @entity12 on saturday night , is clearly a boxer with a difference			1
he split with his trainer just before his first tilt at @entity11 ’s world super-middleweight title , and this is the same eccentric who has just signed for a @entity20 promoter on the eve of the rematch which will make him a superstar in @entity4 , win or lose			1
since @entity11 ’s promoter @entity48 had already asked for another @entity45 referee , @entity49 , to be replaced , this may have been as much a tit - for - tat reaction as a suspicion that @entity51 ’s style might help his opponent			1
boxers usually leave the wheeling and dealing to their managers			0
when @entity6 dispensed with @entity57 , who doubled as his trainer , on the november eve of @entity59 , he then had to hire the lesser - known @entity60 to work his corner			1
@entity62 is now established as his trainer but @entity6 takes care of his own business			2
but why burden himself with the potentially distracting extra workload ? ‘ that part ’s simple , ’ he says			0
‘ i no longer trust anyone else to look after me and my money			0
’ so , as if preparing to fight a three - time champion in @entity11 ’s 12th consecutive world title fight is not enough , the 26 - year - old @entity6 took out a @entity74 licence to manage himself			1
shortly before his work - out in front of hundreds of fellow londoners at the @entity79 shopping centre on tuesday , he found time to lodge his complaint about the ref. popular : hundreds of fans turned out at @entity79 shopping centre to see @entity29 get put through his paces raring to go : @entity6 has predicted he 'll knock out @entity11 in three rounds on saturday night he did so knowing that it might not be possible for a second substitute to be found and flown to @entity88 in time to undergo the @entity4 board ’s stringent medical checks			1
by now the @entity91 , whose world super-middleweight title is at stake along with a @entity96 belt , could be forgiven for wishing they had not acceded to @entity6 ’s petition for this rematch following @entity11 ’s controversial win first time out			1
@entity6 scorned legal representation at that hearing , paying for his trip to @entity105 and arguing his own case			2
he then opposed the use of any @entity4 officials , so upset was he with the premature stoppage inflicted by home referee @entity35			2
gloves on : @entity11 's ( right ) rematch with @entity6 ( left ) will take place on saturday at @entity12 controversy : there has been bad blood between the pair since @entity11 was deemed to have beaten @entity6 in november again he succeeded , though by laying claim to the position of mandatory title challenger he shot himself in the foot financially			1
in these circumstances , the @entity91 stipulate that the defending champion receives up to 85 per cent of the purse			0
so while @entity11 can bank between £ 5 - 10million for saturday night ’s work , depending on the size of the pay - per - view audience , @entity6 is believed to be receiving around £ 1.5m			1
he shrugs and says : ‘ after i ’ve knocked out @entity11 my big pay - days will come			2
’ @entity6 has also vetoed one of the three foreign judges , because he hails from @entity130 , where @entity11 ’s family have their roots			2
‘ ca n’t be too careful , ’ he grins			0
all smiles : @entity6 was in relaxed mood at his public work - out session just four days before his fight with @entity11 rejected : @entity11 's promoter @entity48 has already turned down @entity49 as a possible official for the fight maybe it ’s all part of the mind games with which he drove @entity141 into getting so angry and careless in their first fight that he lunged on to the blow which floored him in the first round			1
‘ i leave nothing to chance , ’ @entity6 continues			0
‘ he needs to understand that his destiny is dawning			0
and while i ’m sure he ’s good enough to win i wo n’t allow him to win			0
’ statements like that irritated the public too , five months ago			0
so having predicted , in the idiom of @entity154 , the precise right - hand punch and the moment he would knock @entity11 down , he compares himself with @entity157			2
‘ @entity154 was very unpopular in @entity45 for some time but he became an idol there and worldwide , ’ he says			0
do not discount more disputes at the final eyeball to eyeball press conference on thursday			0
@entity162 will be televised live on @entity163 on saturday night , at £ 16.95			0

@entity6 has failed in his protest about referee @entity26
@entity51 will referee @entity6 ' super-middleweight bout against @entity11
@entity11 won the first bout with a ninth - round stoppage at @entity171 in november
@entity6 is concerned that @entity51 's *preference* for a free - flowing fight might benefit @entity11
@entity48 , @entity11 's promoter , turned down @entity49 as an official
