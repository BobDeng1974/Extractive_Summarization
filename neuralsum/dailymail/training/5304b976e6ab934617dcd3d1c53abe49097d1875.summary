a company marketing guns to children as ' @entity2 ' has removed its website after a five - year - old boy shot dead his two - year - old sister while playing with one of the weapons			1

he fatally shot his sister , @entity14 , in the chest only minutes after her mother says she stepped outside their home in @entity19 , @entity20 on tuesday			1
the website , which was not accessible on thursday , showed children of all ages firing the mini rifles , which come in a variety of colors , including blue and pink			1

the company 's slogan is ' my first rifle ' and its website has a ' @entity52 ' section where pictures of boys and girls are displayed , most of them showing the children at shooting ranges and on hunts			1
the shooting highlights a cultural divide in the gun debate			1

controversial : the crickett.com website carries the slogan ' my @entity2 ' and sells a range of weapons popular : the website has a ' @entity52 ' where pictures of young boys and girls are displayed , most of them shown at shooting ranges and on bird and deer hunts			1

' you start at a young age with guns for hunting and everything			2
' what is more unusual than a child having a gun , he said , is ' that a kid would get shot with it			1
' ' the goal of @entity11 is to instill gun safety in the minds of youth shooters and encourage them to gain the knowledge and respect that hunting and shooting activities require and deserve , ' the site said			2
the company said that the site was experiencing difficulties because it was inundated with traffic following the little girl 's death			0
attorney @entity119 , who spoke on behalf of the company , told @entity121 that they were working to get the site running again , but could not specify a time			0
@entity119 added that it was not the time to discuss gun control			2
loss : the family said they did not know the gun still had a round left inside , which killed little @entity14 killed : @entity14 's mourning family said they are dealing with the tragedy by turning to their faith ' this is not about @entity137 , ' he said			1
' we need to respect the privacy of these people , this family is going through a lot			2
we 're not going to analyze and evaluate what happened here until a full investigation has been conducted by law enforcement			0
at that point we 'll comment			0
' the coroner said the gun was kept in a corner and the family did n't realize a shell was left inside it			1
it 's ' just one of those crazy accidents , ' @entity84 said			0
the gun was given to the 5 - year - old as a gift last year , ' it was god 's will			2
it was her time to go , i guess , ' @entity14 's grandmother , @entity161 , told @entity164			2
' i just know she 's in heaven right now and i know she 's in good hands with the lord			0
' in a brief news release , state police said the shooting occurred when the boy was ' playing ' with the rifle , but did not elaborate			0
it is not clear whether any charges will be filed , said @entity176 spokesman trooper @entity175			0
weapon : the 5 - year - old boy shot dead his sister with a @entity180 ( like the one pictured ) that he was given a year ago tailored for youngsters : @entity11 also makes guns for adults , but most of its products are geared toward children			1
the smaller guns come in all sorts of colors , including blue and pink scene : the dilapidated home in @entity85 , where the young girl was shot by her brother ' i think it 's too early to say whether there will or wo n't be , ' @entity175 said			1
@entity19 is a small town , with a population of just under 1,800			0
it is located in foothills of @entity203			0
the median household income in 2009 was estimated to be $ 17,747			0
