by @entity1 reporter published : 19:10 est , 11 november 2013 updated : 07:05 est , 12 november 2013 problem ? @entity4 's vouchers are said to be a bid to boost breastfeeding in the @entity7 new mothers will receive up to £ 200 of store vouchers in return for breastfeeding under a controversial scheme partly funded by the taxpayer			1
they will be given coupons for stores such as @entity4 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 as a reward for not relying solely on formula milk			1
the pilot scheme will involve 130 women in @entity22 and @entity23 , but it could later be rolled out nationally			1
but critics say it is a form of bribery , with the nanny state trying to control mothers			2
there are also concerns it is a short - term fix that will not help those who do not breastfeed due to stigma or discomfort			2
@entity7 has one of the lowest breastfeeding rates in @entity36 – only a third of women feed for the recommended six months			1
yet it is known to protect babies from stomach upsets , chest infections , allergies and obesity and may even boost @entity45			0
it also reduces a woman ’s risk of breast cancer and can help her to bond with a newborn			0
the trial , which starts today , will see women offered £ 40 in vouchers if they breastfeed for two days , another £ 40 if they do it for ten days and another £ 40 if they carry on for six weeks			2
they will get £ 40 at three months and again at six months			0
women still breastfeeding by then will have received £ 200			2
the team in charge admit they have no way of proving whether someone is breastfeeding			1
women will simply fill in a form saying they are doing so , and it will be signed off by a midwife			1
the trial is based in areas where breastfeeding rates are half the @entity7 average and strong social stigmas about breastfeeding in public persist			1
it is run by researchers from @entity73 and @entity74 universities , who also oversaw an @entity77 scheme that paid obese patients up to £ 425 to lose 50lb ( 23kg )			0
it has since been abandoned			0
the team insist the latest trial is at a very early stage			0
if it is deemed successful , a national study will be carried out next year and eventually it could be used across the @entity77			0
dr @entity84 , of the @entity85 , said : ‘ we think there are benefits to babies , mums and to society for breastfeeding			0
we are exploring one particular way that might improve breastfeeding rates			1
’ @entity95 , of the @entity96 , said : ‘ whilst we are not against financial incentives for the right reasons , there is a much bigger social and cultural problem here that needs to be tackled instead			0
@entity102 : research reveals 34 per cent of @entity7 women feed their babies milk formula for the first six months ‘ in many areas , including those in this study , there are generations of women who may not have seen anyone breastfeeding their baby , meaning it is not the cultural norm			1
’ @entity119 , of the @entity120 ’ @entity118 , said : ‘ this is yet another example of public health officials believing that the nanny state knows best for every single family			0
’ just 1 per cent of @entity7 women feed babies only breast milk for six months , as recommended by the @entity128			1
around 34 per cent give them a mixture of breast milk and formula for this period .			2

@entity22 women will be given vouchers to *spend* on things other than formula milk and must fill out a form to say they are breastfeeding
team *leaders* admit they have no way of knowing if it is working
@entity7 has one of lowest breastfeeding rates in @entity36 - only a third do
