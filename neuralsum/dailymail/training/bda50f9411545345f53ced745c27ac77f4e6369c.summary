a report was critical of the employee 's manager for creating an atmosphere that permitted ' inappropriate sexual boundaries '			2
the fresh investigation followed a recent meeting with @entity0 when new evidence came to light , according to a council whistleblower			0
' no one in the senior levels of the department was taking this seriously enough , so i felt it was my duty to report it to police myself , ' he told the @entity75			0
' i could not say whether [ the police ] were already aware of it but it seems the issue is now being investigated properly			0
