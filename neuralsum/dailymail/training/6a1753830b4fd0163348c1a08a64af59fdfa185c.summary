by @entity0 published : 06:27 est , 19 november 2012 updated : 12:04 est , 19 november 2012 abuser : 15 - year - old @entity2 raped an elderly man while high on the drug mcat and drunk on vodka a 15 - year - old boy has been jailed after raping a disabled male pensioner while ' out of his own mind ' on a cocktail of vodka and the drug mcat			1
@entity12 pushed his terrified victim , 65 , into a field before attacking him , forcing him to perform a sex act on him and then attempting to rape him again			1
his elderly victim was unable to fight back as he suffers from a condition which restricts the use of his limbs , @entity16 heard			1
the judge took the unusual step of naming and releasing a photo of the teenager because of the seriousness of the crime			1
@entity12 was jailed indefinitely for ' public protection ' but must serve at least three - and - a - half years behind bars after a judge heard the drunk and drug - crazed teenager had subjected his victim to the sickening ten minute assault on august 4 , saying ' we ’re going to have some fun together			1
' he pleaded guilty to three serious sexual assault charges , plus two charges of robbery and charge of theft			0
hours earlier , @entity12 and an accomplice had been involved in the robbery of a mobile phone from a 24 - year - man			1
the robbery occurred on the site of the old @entity47 when the pair , who were part of a larger group , followed the 24 - year - old			1
the first male - who was never identified - hit the victim around the head with a bottle before @entity12 grabbed him in a bear hug			1
the victim fell to the floor and was kicked unconscious , although he recalled @entity12 ordering the other perpetrator to stop because the victim was disabled			1
the victim later woke up and realised his mobile phone and keys were missing			2
the next morning , @entity12 was part of a group who entered @entity66 in @entity67 at around 6.30am , with @entity12 stealing a bottle of vodka			1
around 90 minutes later and still carrying the stolen vodka , he approached the disabled 65 - year - old victim near an allotment site , before escorting him to a field			1
@entity12 made the man perform a sex act on him as well committing rape and attempted rape			1
following the ordeal , @entity12 asked the man if he had any money on him and took his mobile phone before throwing it away			1
he then ordered him lay down until he had left the area			0
shocking : @entity16 heard how the teenager forced himself on the 65 - year - old who could not fight back because of his disability @entity12 then went to a house in @entity87 in which he knew the occupants , but stole a laptop a short time later			1
in the process he left the vodka bottle behind			0
he was later arrested and initially denied the charges until forensic evidence was found on the vodka bottle			0
at least one person a week dies after taking mephedrone , which until two years ago was legal			2
yet despite the dangers the drug , known as ' plant food ' or ' mew meow ' , has been hugely popular because of its cheapness and easy availability			0
it is now a class b drug			0
in 2010 clubbing magazine @entity105 christened mephedrone ' the @entity109 's favourite new drug '			0
used as a replacement for ecstasy or cocaine , it is sold on hundreds of internet sites for around £ 10 a gram			0
and unlike cocaine , it is unlikely to be cut with baking soda , paracetamol or more dangerous substances			0
buying it online with your credit card is straightforward and avoids any contact with drug dealers or the danger of a run - in with the law			2
a survey for the magazine found four out of ten of those surveyed had tried it and a third had taken it within the previous month			0
one in six said they took it every week			0
it is most often snorted in powder form but can also be obtained in pills and capsules			0
side - effects include headaches , palpitations , nausea , high blood pressure , a burning throat , nose bleeds and purple joints , especially the knees and hands			2
defending , @entity150 said @entity12 had a difficult upbringing and was physically abused as a small child by his mother ’s former drug - addicted partner			1
he had gone to live with his grandparents which mr @entity150 said were ' the only stable force in this life ' , but he was eventually diagnosed of suffering from @entity158 ( attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ) at the age of 13 and put on medication to combat the illness			0
mr @entity150 said in the six months leading up to committing these crimes , he had begun to take the mind - altering class - b drug @entity164 , was smoking cannabis and drinking			1
mr @entity150 said : ' one can only guess what it did when it was mixed with @entity158			0
it was in that state of mind that he committed these offences			2
he was in no way in his own mind and is shocked , disgusted and sickened by what he did			2
' he also argued that the motive behind the sexual offences was not for sexual gratification , but rather to degrade and humiliate the victim			2
this was agreed by @entity182			0
the judge jailed him for three years and four months for the robbery , rejecting the claim that it was not premeditated after arguing @entity12 and his unnamed assailant had followed the victim			1
he then jailed him for three years and eight months for the three sexual offences			2
he said he must serve at least three - and - half years in total , and would only be released when he was deemed no longer a risk to the public			1
he must also sign the @entity192 for life			0
judge @entity182 said : ' i ca n’t form a reliable view that an extended detention would achieve the protection of the public from serious harm			0
' detective constable @entity200 , from the @entity201 , said : ' the men @entity12 attacked continue to have problems to this day and the impact his violent and cruel crimes had on them can not be understated			2
' @entity12 had been drinking vodka and taking @entity164 during his two - day crime spree , which had a significant impact on his behaviour			1
the alcohol and drugs was a recipe for disaster , and innocent people paid the price			0
' he will have to live with what he ’s done , and the pain and suffering he ’s caused , for the rest of his life			0
i hope that today will signal an end to this incredibly painful chapter in the lives of his victims and they can at least take some comfort in the fact that he ’s had to answer for what he did			0

the 65 - year - old victim could not fight off @entity12 because of his disability
the teenager was ' out of his mind ' on drink and drugs during sick attack
he pushed pensioner into field and shouted ' we ’re going to have some fun '
@entity2 jailed ' indefinitely ' but must serve at least three - and - a - half years
judge names him and releases picture because of *ferocity* of perverted crime
