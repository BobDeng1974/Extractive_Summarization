by @entity0 the @entity1 may owe its origins to iron - rich dust blown over from the @entity6 desert			1
this dust nourishes microbes that produce calcium carbonate , the core building block of the @entity1 , a study has found			1
over the last 100 million years the carbonate has formed into the @entity13 , a 2.8 mile - thick ( 4.5 kilometre ) platform located in the western @entity15			1
a satellite image of the @entity13 is shown on the left			0
on the right is the distribution of insoluble material in the sediments and collection sites re shown			0
the insoluble material ( shown in red ) is derived from atmospheric dust without this dust , the @entity1 would n’t exist , scientists say , and we would instead have a wide open ocean with a slight underwater bump on sonar			1
researchers from the @entity33 analysed concentrations of two trace elements characteristic of atmospheric dust – iron and manganese – from 270 seafloor samples from the @entity1			1
the team found that the highest concentrations of elements occurred to the west of @entity44 , an area which has the largest concentration of whitings			0
the @entity6 is the major source of mineral dust , which is blown by persistent winds across @entity51 's 3.5 - million square mile desert the @entity6 is the major source of mineral dust , which is blown by persistent winds across @entity51 's 3.5 - million square mile desert			2
this dust subsequently spreads across the @entity56 , where it is the origin of rain dust			0
these winds , which lift mineral - rich sand into the atmosphere , also travel the nearly 5,000 mile ( 8,000 km ) north west journey towards the @entity63 and @entity64			2
here , the dust nourishes microbes that produce calcium carbonate , the core building block of the @entity1			1
whitings are white sediment - laden bodies of water produced by cyanobacteria , which obtained their energy through photosynthesis			0
' @entity77 needs 10 times more iron than other photosynthesisers because they fix atmospheric nitrogen , ' said professor @entity82 , lead author of the study			0
' this process draws down the carbon dioxide and induces the precipitation of calcium carbonate , thus causing the whiting			2
’ they claim the dust particles blown into the @entity1 ' waters and directly onto the islands provide the nutrients necessary to fuel cyanobacteria blooms			2
this is in turn , produce carbonate whitings in the surrounding waters			0
the dust is blown by persistent winds across @entity51 's 3.5 - million square mile @entity6 lifts mineral - rich sand into the atmosphere			1
it then travels the nearly 5,000 mile ( 8,000km ) northwest journey towards the @entity63 and @entity64			0
these winds , which lift mineral - rich sand into the atmosphere , also travel the nearly 5,000 mile ( 8,000 km ) north west journey towards the @entity63 and @entity109 , the dust nourishes microbes that produce calcium carbonate , the core building block of the @entity1			1

scientists in @entity116 claim without this dust , the @entity1 would not exist
the iron - rich dust nourishes microbes that produce calcium carbonate
over 100 million years , carbonate has formed the @entity13
