by @entity0 published : 03:57 est , 24 october 2012 updated : 04:26 est , 24 october 2012 a 27 - year - old woman suffering from a rare cancer is desperate to raise £ 25,000 to fund an operation that could save her life			1
@entity5 was diagnosed with cancer of the appendix last year , which affects just one in two million people			1
she had surgery to remove the deadly cancerous tissue in june but was told it had started to regrow in august			1
experts now say she has just six to eight months to live			0
but determined not to give up hope , @entity15 , of @entity16 , @entity17 , found a top doctor in @entity19 who believes he can save her life			1
the operation alone will cost £ 25,000 , however , while she will need extra cash to cover @entity24 and her friends and family have so far collected about £ 7,000 towards their vital target			2
determined : @entity15 , with her pet dog , and with boyfriend @entity30 , says she is not ready to give up fighting miss @entity5 said last night from her bed in @entity33 , @entity34 : ' the operation in @entity19 is with the hope of removing all or controlling the cancer			1
' i do n't know which it will be yet , but doing nothing ... it will kill me			2
' doctors in @entity19 are confident they can do a good job to hopefully remove it			1
i 'm guessing that this is my last chance			0
' @entity15 added : ' it 's either that or admit defeat			2
what would other people do at my age and in my situation ? ' i 'm not ready to just give up			0
' @entity52 , or @entity52 is a cancer of the appendix			2
it usually starts as a small growth that breaks through the appendix wall and spreads tumour cells to the lining of the abdominal cavity			0
it produces a mucus , which contains the cancer cells , that spreads to the abdominal organs such as the intestines , liver and pancreas			0
in june , @entity15 had a nine - hour operation at @entity68 - one of two @entity52 specialist centres in the @entity70 - to remove her affected organs , including parts of her small intestine			1
the surgeon left small bits of cancerous tissue because of the length of surgery amid hopes of not damaging more of her liver and small intestine			0
doctors tried to kill the remaining cancerous cells through heated chemotherapy treatment			0
but in august , miss @entity5 was told the cancer had started to grow again in her bowel and was given six to eight months to live by doctors at @entity33 's giving hope : prof dr @entity89 at @entity90 , @entity19 , believes he can help @entity15 @entity15 , who works for golf ball manufacturer @entity91 in @entity16 , refused to accept the diagnosis and looked for doctors overseas who would be able to operate			1
' when the cancer started growing back where they left it on the bowel and liver , i was told there was not going to be a second operation , ' she said			2
' @entity104 and the @entity105 in @entity106 - the other @entity52 specialist hospital - do n't feel they can operate because of where the cancer is			2
' they do n't have the expertise			0
' after desperately searching for doctors in @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 , @entity15 found prof @entity89 at @entity90 , @entity19			1
prof @entity117 has carried out more than 450 of the operations that @entity15 needs			2
her mother @entity119 said : ' we have to raise the money for her			0
some days i wake up and think it 's a dream and then i realise it 's actually happening			0
' it 's absolutely devastating for it to happen to someone so young			0
' there are times when @entity15 seems to be coping , then the next moment she is very angry and cries			1
' she asks - why is it happening to me ? what have i done to deserve this ? ' she 's a nice girl and has n't done anything , so it 's very hard			0
' mrs @entity5 added : ' the doctors at @entity33 's have said they do n't have the knowledge and they say that if they operate , @entity15 will die on the table			1
' but the doctor in @entity19 says they have done the operation before and it will be successful			1
' the @entity142 wo n't pay for the operation because @entity144 's says the cancer is terminal , but they have said they will reimburse her part of the money if she survives			1
' that money would then be given to the @entity149 charity to put the money into research to stop this from happening to anyone else			0
' @entity15 would have her operation within two weeks before spending a month in hospital in @entity155 recovering if she can raise the money			1
