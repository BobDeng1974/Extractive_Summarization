there are two things women are almost guaranteed to wake up with after a night out dancing in high heels : sore feet and at least one twisted ankle			1
but did you know you could also wake up with a more toned bottom and slimmer thighs ? for while the effect of high heels on women 's bodies is widely thought to be negative - stilettos are known to cause everything from joint problems to bunions - fitness fans are increasingly claiming that they are actually the secret to a sculpted physique			1
a tall order : @entity21 tries out kicks in her heels there 's just one catch : to feel the full benefit , you have to exercise in sky - high shoes			1
high - heel workouts are growing in popularity in the @entity32 - with classes including ' the @entity34 ' and ' @entity35 ' , in which women walk , squat and even do sit - ups in heels , on offer in @entity42 and @entity43 gyms			1
and now the trend is coming to the @entity45			1
celebrities here already seem to be getting in on the act - high - heel lover @entity48 recently tweeted a picture of herself in 5in - high stiletto boots walking on a treadmill with a desk attached			1
which is why i find myself - a 45 - year - old who gave up high heels 20 years ago ( bar the odd , painful wedding reception or girls ’ night out ) - standing in my local park wearing @entity61 leggings , a vest … and red skyscrapers			1
here to teach me the basics of working out in killer heels is @entity45 personal trainer @entity66 , who has developed a high - heel workout that claims to tone legs , bottoms , hips , thighs and core abdominal muscles in ways they ’ve never been toned before			1
shape up : squats like these in heels are said to tone up the legs and bottom @entity80 - based @entity66 , 29 , began devising the routine 18 months ago while trying out a range of fitness dvds , including one based on pole dancing in which participants wore heels			1
' this particular workout required you to do squats and lunges while wearing them , ' remembers @entity66			1
' i had never felt my leg muscles work so hard			0
' it instinctively made sense to me			0
the best workout is done on a hill because doing lower body moves with the ankles lifted slightly higher make the calf , hip and leg muscles work much harder			1
' wearing heels at least 3in high means anything you do that works the lower body is not only more effective , it works the smaller muscles , too			1
' you discover soreness in areas that you do n't when you ’re wearing trainers , especially the bottom muscles , the calves , inner thighs and outer hips			2
' according to @entity66 , the results have been astounding			1
after 12 months of doing this workout three times a week , her clients have narrower hips , tighter bottoms - and no broken ankles			1
yet can this way of exercising really be sensible ? after all , podiatrists have been preaching the evils of heels for years , warning that they shorten the @entity124 in the ankle and put pressure on discs in the spine by forcing wearers to push their hips forward for balance			1
personal trainer @entity66 shows @entity21 how the workout is done last year , the @entity134 found that one in ten @entity45 women had joint problems , arthritis and muscular issues , and more than half had bunions , as a result of walking in high heels			1
despite all this , the prospect of looking great in skinny jeans is tempting - hence my appointment with @entity66			1
thankfully , the first thing she does is make me change back into my trainers for a 20 - minute run			2
' running in heels is just downright silly , as the risk of falling over and jarring the joints is so high , ' she tells me			1
but as soon as the run is over , it 's high - heel time			1
i pull them on and , feeling rather silly , start three sets of 20 squats			0
squat exercises are tough enough in functional footwear : with your legs apart , you lower your bottom on to an imaginary seat using all the strength you can muster			2
with three inches from the heels added to my 5ft 3in frame , i have to lower my bottom further , which works my calves and hips so hard they burn			1
i ’m pouring with sweat by the end of the third set			0
i include squats in my daily workout and usually find them perfectly manageable - but these ones hurt in whole new areas , most notably my inner thighs			1
' right , kick - boxing next , ' shouts @entity66 , pulling out a pair of sparring pads from her bag of props			1
' what , in heels ? ' i ask			2
can she be serious ? @entity21 did get some unusual looks when she did moves like tricep dips on a park bench in her heels oh yes			2
i have to get into fighting stance and kick my back foot forward to various heights , hitting the pad with the side of my calf			2
to balance requires a laser - like focus , which means i can think of little else but staying on my feet - and how much my tummy muscles are hurting			0
we move on to walking lunges with bicep curls - putting one stilettoed foot in front of the other and lowering my body weight almost to the ground before lifting the back foot up and doing it again , curling my arms at the same time - for 100 metres			2
by the halfway point i 'm gasping for breath , my bottom and leg muscles crying for mercy			0
we 're also getting stares from passers - by : working out in heels is n't for the shy and retiring			2
yet when a truck goes by with a catchy song blaring from its open windows , i break into a dance - normally reserved for wedding receptions - and begin joyously waving splayed arms about , shaking my booty and doing my best mum - dancing			0
suddenly , i feel 25 and sexy again			0
it 's as if i 've had a glimpse of the reckless young woman i used to be , teetering in my thigh - high stilettoed boots on the dance floor or strutting across town in bright - red patent @entity236 , and loving the powerfully sexy feeling it gives me			2
' high heels make you feel sexy and more confident , ' says @entity66			1
' for clients who hate working out , it 's a great way of forgetting they ’re trying to get fit and making the workout more fun			0
' and exercising in heels can make you feel more comfortable in them on nights out			0
' word of warning : physios warn that exercising in heels can cause damage to the joints the next day , i can hardly walk and my inner and outer thighs are so sore that just sitting down causes moans of agony			0
but it 's the good pain that a tough workout can bring , and makes me wonder if i should pop on some heels while using my favourite workout dvds			2
however , physiotherapist @entity263 has some words of warning : ' working out in high heels is absolutely crazy and completely ridiculous			2
' you 're increasing the stress through your legs because you 're working out with your feet in an abnormal position			0
most of the force is going into the big toe , which can lead to bunions			0
' it can also damage joints , he says			0
' if you work out wearing heels instead of trainers , the foot does n't adequately absorb the force of movements such as lunges and squats			0
that force has to go somewhere , so it adds unhealthy pressure to the knees , the hips , the ankles and back			0
' this can also increase the risk of back pain , injury and inflammation , he warns			0
' the lower back is under so much pressure in heels because all your weight is shifted forwards			0
that means the discs in the lower spine are at greater risk of becoming stiff and inflamed , and this could lead to serious back injuries such as prolapsed disc where a spinal disc presses against a nerve root in the back causing severe pain			0
' so is there any merit in high - heeled workouts ? ' i can see how it can strengthen the calf muscles because the calves have to work harder with the ankle on an incline , ' admits @entity324 ' it can also potentially improve balance because there is less contact with the ground , so other muscles are forced to work harder to keep you upright and stabilise your body			1
' in fact , every muscle in the leg will work harder if you 're wearing high heels			2
' but there are much better and safer ways to strengthen leg muscles - starting with good supportive trainers			0
' maybe i wo n't be throwing my stilettos into my gym bag just yet			0
but i might make the effort to go out dancing with the girls again - my thighs will thank me for it			0
