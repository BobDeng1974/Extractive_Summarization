@entity0 believes the summer of change at @entity2 helped rather than hindered him as an incoming manager			1
saints have been the surprise package of the @entity5 season so far , after a player exodus that many thought would harm the club 's chance of making progress actually providing the perfect platform for an early charge out of the blocks			1
@entity2 head to @entity15 on saturday with 19 points from their opening nine @entity5 fixtures - a points haul bettered only by leaders @entity21			1
new boss @entity0 ( @entity22 ) has guided @entity2 to second in the @entity5 after nine games @entity0 saw star players including @entity25 ( @entity22 ) and @entity26 ( r ) leave @entity27 's when the likes of @entity30 , @entity25 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity26 all left during the summer , the doom - mongers gathered to predict tough times ahead for @entity0			1
however , the @entity33 thinks being able to stamp his mark on the team from the off has contributed to @entity2 ' flying start to the campaign			1
' it helped , although ( @entity41 ) @entity40 was already on the scouting list at @entity2 , ' said @entity0			1
' it also came down to positions			0
@entity25 left , so we have to bring in a similar player to @entity25			1
@entity31 goes , so we have to bring in another striker			1
spending the money in the positions that we needed was the most important thing			0
' but what happened is not normal			0
normally you would have to change one or two new players , instead of six or seven players			2
but this way it is more my team as i have my own players rather than what was left by the other manager			1
' good players , good quality players , can adapt , although it usually takes some time			2
this team looks like it has already been together for two seasons			0
but that is down to the players because they are good players			0
' the @entity33 revealed that star playmaker @entity40 was already being scouted by @entity2 @entity68 ( c ) has been one of the finds of the season after replacing @entity31 up front asked if he thought @entity2 could maintain their momentum and realistically challenge for a top - four place this season , @entity0 replied : ' we can keep this , i 'm not afraid about the situation			1
' if i look at the rest of the teams , i do n't think a lot of them are better than @entity2			2
' i think we have gone under the radar			0
maybe some people are very surprised but from the start of the season i saw what i had and i had belief , belief in the players and their spirit			2
' okay , maybe not to be second in the league at this moment , but we have good players and we play good football and everybody enjoys how we play			0
' it is not only in the league that @entity2 have excelled this season			2
saints won at @entity100 in midweek to reach the quarter - finals of the @entity102 , where they will face @entity104			0
this graphic shows how much the @entity2 have improved in attack and defence this season while @entity0 accepts being paired against the @entity109 side gives his team an excellent chance to progress , the @entity33 is not getting carried away by thoughts of @entity113 just yet			1
he said : ' i think it is a good draw because i think it can be worse , maybe @entity21 , @entity117 , @entity118 away			0
' you have to be lucky about the draw in a cup			0
again it is an away game , that 's a pity , but it is a good chance to reach the semi-finals			0
' we are doing a good job in the @entity102 , we have played three matches away and we have three wins , we have to keep that up in the next game			0
' ' but it is too early ( to start thinking about @entity113 ) , maybe if we reach the semi-final when it is more clear , then it is more realistic			0
' another new signing @entity136 ( @entity22 ) is expected to return against @entity15 after sitting out of the @entity102 win @entity138 could return to the @entity2 squad at @entity15			1
@entity136 was rested as a precaution against @entity100 on wednesday night			2
the midfielder was expected to train on friday in the hope that he will be included in the squad that travels to @entity144			0
@entity0 , whose team have won six of their last seven @entity5 matches , otherwise has a full squad to select from .			1

@entity2 are second in the @entity5 table after a storming start
new manager @entity0 believes summer *upheaval* assisted him
players including @entity30 , @entity25 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity26 all left @entity27 's
@entity136 is expected to be back in contention to face @entity15
