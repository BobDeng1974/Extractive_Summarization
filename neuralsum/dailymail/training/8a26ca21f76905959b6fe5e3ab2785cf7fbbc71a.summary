by @entity0 @entity1 is not altering flight paths over @entity3 despite alliance partner @entity5 ' plans to stop flying above the area within 10 days due to fears of @entity10 - style attacks			1
the @entity13 airline 's decision to keep flying through @entity3 airspace on @entity15 to @entity17 flights is based on its latest security assessments			2
@entity5 has decided to re-route planes along different flight paths amid concerns about the dangers posed by @entity24 militants on the ground and the risk of missile strikes following the loss of @entity29			1
@entity5 route change comes after @entity10 was shot down by a surface - to - air missile while travelling over eastern @entity40 , killing all 298 on board , on july 17			2
sir @entity42 , president of the @entity15 - based airline , said he believed other airlines would soon follow suit as he called for government agencies to offer more advice about flying over conflict zones			1
mr @entity42 said @entity5 flights would be re-routed over the next week to ten days and confirmed routes being considered included over @entity51 and the @entity52 , over @entity53 and into @entity55 airspace , or over @entity56			1
he said he had taken action because he was no longer ‘ comfortable ’ with planes flying over @entity60 - held territory in @entity3			1
sir @entity42 , president of @entity15 - based airline @entity5 , said planes would be re-routed along different flight paths over the next week to 10 days amid concerns about missile strikes and the dangers posed by militants ' this is a political animal but the fact of the matter is @entity10 changed everything , and that was very nearly in @entity55 airspace , ' he told @entity74			1
' we can not continue to say , " well it 's a political thing "			0
we have to do something			0
we have to take the bull by the horns			0
' a @entity1 spokesman said the airline constantly reviewed its flight paths and made changes when needed , reported @entity84			1
' there is no suggestion that flying over @entity3 is unsafe for commercial airlines , particularly given the cruising altitude that most , including @entity1 , maintain , ' he said			1
' we will continue to monitor the situation , with safety as our top priority			0
' @entity1 has two daily @entity93 flights on the @entity15 - @entity17 route , which fly at an altitude of 38,000 to 41,000 feet over @entity3			1
the above map , which shows routes taken by major airline carriers this month , shows how planes are flying over dangerous areas of the world			2
dotted lines are probable routes for which exact data is not available the @entity105 provides advice to @entity1 from @entity108 and @entity55 regulators and the airline is currently avoiding @entity111 airspace			2
the move by @entity5 could result in longer flight times and increased costs such as fuel and staffing , all of which could be passed onto passengers unless the airline is prepared to cover the costs			1
according to an aviation analyst , consumers were unlikely to be prepared to wear these costs when @entity1 is seen as one of the world 's safest airline			0
@entity5 currently operates the largest number of flights over @entity3 as well as flights to @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132 in the country , although no changes to these flights have been outlined as yet			1
the country lies on the border of the main flight path between @entity55 and @entity139 , with hundreds of aircraft passing over it each day			0
a popular route is over the @entity3 city of @entity144 , a stronghold of @entity60 militants			2
on monday , @entity5 as well as @entity148 , @entity146 and @entity147 were flying in @entity3 airpace , according to @entity150			1
the above graphic shows the flight paths of a snapshot of planes flying over @entity144 , an @entity60 stronghold in @entity3 , last weekend			1
the prospect has been raised that @entity60 has missiles which could shoot down a plane @entity60 , the terrorist group which took over swathes of @entity3 in june and declared it an ' @entity159 ' , are a brutal , @entity160 group which has boasted of holding mass executions , crucifixion and imposing hardline @entity24 law on its conquered territory			1
the move by @entity5 comes ahead of a scheduled meeting between airline industry groups today , which will see chiefs discuss possible ways to reduce the risks of flying over conflict zones			2
the meeting , held by the @entity173 – a @entity175 body – comes following two major air disasters this month			0
as well as @entity10 being shot down , an @entity178 plane crashed in @entity179 , north @entity180 , on thursday , killing all of the 116 passengers on board			0
it is not yet clear what brought down the plane			0

it was has been reported that the @entity108 is investigating if @entity3 fighters have missiles able to bring down a civilian aircraft			0
until the @entity10 disaster , @entity5 flew over eastern @entity40 along with @entity196 , @entity148 and @entity197 while @entity198 and @entity146 were not			0
since moving its @entity55 hub from @entity200 to @entity15 last year , @entity1 has avoided eastern @entity40 and stopped flying over @entity201 in the country 's south in april because of escalating conflict with @entity205			2
