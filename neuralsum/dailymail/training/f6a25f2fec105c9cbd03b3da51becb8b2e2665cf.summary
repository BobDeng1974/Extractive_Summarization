almost 140,000 people have signed a petition demanding that retailer @entity2 pay its cleaners a living wage of £ 7.85 an hour			1
despite the @entity7 - which made a £ 424million profit last year - offering competitive benefits and a bonus scheme , cleaners are employed by an external contractor and are not paid the same as staff at the company 's stores			1
last month @entity16 reported that protesters supporting the petition were arrested as they took part in a demonstration at the flagship @entity2 store in @entity22			1
@entity34 argue that the @entity39 is £ 7.85 in the @entity28 and £ 9.15 in @entity22 - in comparison to the actual minimum wage of £ 6.50			1
the petition , on website @entity25 , states : ‘ @entity2 brands itself as a company that is committed to treating its suppliers , customers and partners with fairness			2
‘ but it has contracted out its cleaning services			0
its cleaners receive less than the living wage and are not entitled to the bonus payments paid to directly employed staff			1
‘ given @entity2 ’s impressive profit levels , it is very troubling that it refuses to show moral leadership and pay its cleaners the living wage			1
’ the company 's flagship @entity2 store on @entity63 , @entity22 , which was the scene of a heated protest last month - campaigners supporting the petition stormed the shop and demanded fair pay for cleaners @entity71 , a @entity2 customer , set up the petition after reading an article which said that despite recording impressive profit levels , the company did not pay cleaners a living wage			1
she told @entity16 today : ‘ i was hoping there would be a good response , and there has been			0
‘ we ’ve had 10,000 new signatures over the last week or so , so momentum is growing			2
‘ we are next hoping to set up a network of local groups to raise the profile of the petition			0
‘ i think the petition is potentially quite a powerful weapon because it ’s a good way or communicating and it does put pressure on @entity2			0
‘ they pride themselves on being ethical and fair retailers and this does not fit with that ethic really			0
‘ talking to customers coming out of the store , most customers were not aware that @entity2 does not pay a living wage and were quite shocked			1
' i think if we are able to raise the profile of the petition and get a lot more signatures , that can only help in terms of putting pressure on @entity2			2
’ the group also want cleaners to be included in the partnership 's annual bonus scheme and given the same rights as other workers			2
the @entity7 , which employs around 90,000 people , says while it believes in fair pay , it can not enforce pay levels well above market rates on the contractors it uses			1
@entity7 is owned by a trust on behalf of all its employees , who are known as partners			2
it runs the @entity2 department stores as well as @entity124 supermarkets			0
partners have a say in how the company is run , as well as a share of the annual profits through a bonus scheme			2
it is one of the largest private companies in the @entity28			0
last year partners received a bonus of 15 per cent of their annual salary - equivalent to almost eight weeks ' pay			1
@entity7 employs around 90,000 @entity138 are employed by an external contractor but @entity140 wants them to receive the same benefits as @entity2 partnership staff			1
@entity2 spokesman @entity143 said : ' we share the @entity39 campaign ’s objectives to pay employees fairly , but we also think that outsourcing is a perfectly legitimate business function ; that pay is rightly a core responsibility of the individual employer ; and that the issue of low pay in the @entity28 and the solution , is much more complex than raising a higher wage floor			1
' within the @entity7 , our policy is to pay the market rate for a job and as much above that as can be justified by performance			1
' our pay ranges typically extend further than those in many of our competitors			0
' on top of that our partners receive a share of our profits as well as other benefits such as a final salary pension			2
' we do n’t believe it is appropriate , therefore , for us to set pay rates well above market levels for subcontractors or suppliers , particularly as it would be inconsistent with the broader pay and reward policy we adopt for 90,000 of our own partners			0
' in december police were called after a group of chanting protesters descended on the @entity2 @entity184 in @entity22			0
the incident took place as dozens of customers were doing their @entity189 shopping on one of the busiest weekends of the year			0
at least one protester was bundled to the floor as officers tried to contain demonstrators and get them to leave the busy shop			0
the flagship branch of @entity2 in @entity63 , @entity22 , which protesters stormed in december one shopper , who did not want to be named , said : ' it 's bad enough shopping in @entity63 two saturdays before @entity189 without a load of idiots coming between you and the kitchenware section			2
' it was absolutely packed in there and so when they started shouting i think the staff panicked a bit and then before we knew it there a load of police officers descended on the place			0
' they were trying to get them to leave but the protesters were having none of it			0
' some demonstrators were seen hanging banners over the railings which said : ' justice for the @entity225 ' and going down the escalators blowing horns			0
other campaigners were seen holding boards which said : ' @entity2 your customers say pay your cleaners the living wage			1
