flat pack furniture - three words that drum fear into the hearts of any women and men across the world who have ever walked the aisles of @entity9			2
but brace yourselves , because we could soon be buying flat - pack clothing from the @entity14 furniture giant too			0
@entity16 business consultant @entity15 has predicted a new way of clothes shopping that works perfectly with @entity9 's business model , where customers buy ready - to - assemble furniture			1
@entity14 business consultant @entity15 predicts ready - to - assemble clothing is the future			1
he thinks @entity9 has the perfect business structure to kick - start the trend he believes that the company could sell both fully - made items of hard - wearing clothing and separate parts that people could take home and make themselves			1
the idea would mean that people could create clothing tailored to individual tastes by piecing together separate parts , with only basic sewing needed - the same level of skills necessary to build a bedside cabinet			0
on a grand scale , this would allow customers to choose from a wide range of style changes , including colour , button shape , sleeve length , pocket shape and trouser length and shape			1
@entity15 told @entity53 magazine in @entity54 : ‘ emotionally , this connects people to how life was in the beginning - customers can personalise and “ hack ” the designs			2
’ customers would be able to choose from different colours , buttons and sleeve length and take the separate pieces home to construct he believes the new way of buying clothing could be such a huge success that it might even be applied to shopping for wedding dresses - a notoriously difficult procedure because of the detailed wishes that brides have			1
he also thinks that @entity9 could become a go - to place for hard - wearing garments , similar to the reputation it has built around furniture			0
he said : ' we ’re already seeing some shoppers go to outdoor and living stores to buy longer - lasting clothing			0
' customer would need only basic sewing to make the garments - the same level of skills necessary to build a bedside cabinet he continued : ' @entity9 already sells reusable kr 4 bags that are good and cheap ; their clothes could be equally practical , as strong as work clothes			0
' @entity9 has said that it has no current plans to start a clothing line , but if they did decide to , they would be wise into account @entity15 's ideas for the project			2
he has even come up with an extensive loyalty scheme , which would include discounts for furniture customers who are wearing the company 's clothing , to make people feel as though they are part of a worldwide community .			0
