@entity2 's public health spokesman @entity0 says there is a culture of ' sexting , slut - shaming and striptease ' in @entity9 schools children are being seriously damaged by the ‘ pornification ’ of @entity9 culture , a senior @entity2 figure will warn today			1
shadow public health minister @entity0 will admit that the notion that overt , public displays of sexuality were ‘ enlightened liberation ’ was wrong – and has instead created a ‘ prison ’ for a generation of young women			1
following yesterday ’s warning by the prime minister ’s new childhood guru @entity22 that parents must challenge children about their text and internet messages , miss @entity0 will agree there is a pernicious culture of ‘ sexting , slut - shaming and striptease ’ in @entity9 schools			1
parents are ‘ struggling to cope ’ and need help to block inappropriate content on the internet and mobile phones , she will say , adding : ‘ we need to start a national conversation between parents and their children about sex , pornography and technology			1
‘ for so long , it ’s been argued that overt , public displays of sexuality are an enlightened liberation			1
' but i believe that for many , the pressure of conforming to hypersexualisation and its pitfalls is a prison			2
and the permanence of social media and technology can be a life sentence			0
’ ’ the @entity2 frontbencher ’s intervention , in a speech to the @entity57 , suggests an emerging political consensus on the need for radical thinking on the commercialisation and sexualisation of childhood			2
in yesterday ’s @entity69 , mrs @entity22 , appointed by the prime minister as his adviser on the issue last month , set out a range of proposals including better systems for parents and children to report inappropriate behaviour online , restrictions on access to sexually explicit music videos and ‘ lads ’ mags ’ , and better teaching of internet safety in schools			1
most controversially , she insisted parents should challenge the culture of ‘ children ’s rights ’ which suggests they should be able to communicate with friends and strangers online or by text in private			2
miss @entity0 will today agree that parents must be put ‘ back in control ’			1
‘ i want to highlight what i believe is the rise of a secret garden , striptease culture in @entity9 schools and society , which has been put beyond the control of @entity9 families by fast - developing technology , and an increasingly pornified @entity9 culture , ’ she will say			2
‘ there ’s something wrong with a society as a whole when children say they have no - one to turn to for advice because their parents – outwitted by technology , and struggling to juggle work and home life – do n't really know what 's going on			1
‘ there ’s something wrong with a society when many young girls of all classes are pressurised into exposing themselves online , and are then humiliated			1
‘ there ’s something wrong with a society when most children say their sex education is out - of - touch , irrelevant and too little too late			0
and where boys end up turning to hardcore online pornography to teach them what they think they need to know			0
many young girls are being forced to conform to hypersexualisation ( picture posed by model ) ‘ there ’s something wrong with a society that normalises children of every background “ sexting ” from their bedrooms			1
there ’s something wrong with a society that sells t - shirts for little girls emblazoned with " future porn star " , and when padded bras , thongs and high heeled shoes are marketed and sold to children			2
‘ there something wrong with a society that has gangs of disenfranchised young men who use rape and sexual assault as the weapon of choice			2
’ miss @entity0 will reject the idea that she is ‘ hankering after some rose - tinted picture of childhood ’			1
she will insist : ‘ do we really have to just accept things as they are ? as parents we 're told - often by our own kids - that we 've just got to live with it - that the world has changed			2
' but i do n’t think we should simply throw our hands up and accept the world – and the all - consuming market - as it is			0
‘ we need to talk about how we put families , and not the lowest common denominator of the market , back in control			0
we ’ve got to build a society based on open - minded family values , and not ‘ anything - goes ’ market values			0
‘ parents and teachers have a duty to ensure that children develop a healthy view of sexuality , distinct from this porn version that is swamping and infiltrating @entity9 life			1
' because it ’s a very specific form of sexuality that ’s being imposed , on children and adults : a porn version			0
this is what kids are dealing with on a daily basis			0
‘ young people are accessing far harder pornographic images than ten or 15 years ago			0
we have to ask , does that influence what they themselves put out on the internet ? ’ miss @entity0 will say that while most parents would not allow their children to watch an 18 - rated film , they are often ‘ powerless ’ when it comes to what they access online and by mobile phone			1
‘ i think one of the symptoms of the culture that has grown is that young girls and women are subject to " slut shaming " and sexual bullying in schools			1
‘ it ’s hypersexualized @entity9 culture in which women are objectified , objectify one another , and are encouraged to objectify themselves ; where homophobic bullying is normalised ; and young boys ’ world view is shaped by hardcore @entity214 pornography and other dark corners of the internet , ’ she will say			1
@entity219 's new childhood guru , mp @entity22 wants parents to ask their children about their text messages @entity2 is calling for a ‘ sex education revolution ’ in schools – with lessons focused on ‘ preparing young people to form healthy , respectful , emotionally fulfilling relationships ’			1
miss @entity0 will also say it must be ‘ easier for parents to block adult and age - restricted material across all media ’			1
‘ internet users should have to make an active choice over whether they allow adult content or not			0
we must look at ‘ child friendly ’ computers and mobile phones where adult content is filtered out by default , ’ she will say mrs @entity22 told the @entity243 ’s @entity242 : ‘ parents are feeling a powerlessness about their kids ’ lives			1
when we were growing up , if someone was phoning our houses or sending letters to the home , parents would feel they had a responsibility to intervene			2
‘ somehow we have kind of ceded that responsibility			0
we feel a nervousness about becoming involved in our kids ’ online lives			0
‘ i ’ve got three children – it ’s not an easy thing to do			0
of course children should have privacy in childhood , but we have exposed them to third party dangers and almost become complicit in that			0
‘ we are usually paying for these mobile phone contracts and devices			0
have n’t we got a responsibility to monitor what ’s going on ? we need a return to common sense			0
’ @entity272 , director of the @entity273 campaign group , insisted there was ‘ total lack of evidence ’ to support what he branded mrs @entity22 ’s ‘ @entity279 2.0 campaign ’			2
‘ parenting is dependent on a relationship of trust , and spying only undermines the parent - child relationship			0
whether reading a diary or reading a text message , privacy is not something to be brushed aside in a wave of hysteria and cheap headlines , ’ he said .			0
