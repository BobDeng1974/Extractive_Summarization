by @entity0 taking inspiration from the forbidden fruit that tempted @entity3 in the @entity4 , a bio artist wants to create his own version of the tree of knowledge - using @entity9			1
@entity10 from @entity12 ’s genetics lab has devised a mathematical formula to add layers of data to @entity16			1
he now plans to add a decoded version of the online encyclopaedia into the dna of a 4,000 - year - old strain of apple , which he claims is the closest he could get to fruit from the biblical tale			1
one number is the @entity16 itself , the protein it ’s translated to creates another number , and then there ’s the redundant codons			0
@entity10 wrote a mathematical genetic code to add layers of information to @entity16 by inserting it under areas occupied by these redundant codons			1
the apple genome can be described as a 750 million letter book , using the four letters of @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 the words are translated into these letters of @entity16 using a code , similar to how @entity60 and shorthand compress words to single marks			0
once coded , these letters are placed within the apple using bacteria that evolves to inserts its genome through the cell walls			2
by inputting the information into the gaps in the @entity16 , it should n’t affect the taste or texture of the apple			2
@entity10 , 63 , is the artist in residence at @entity76 ’s genetics lab , at @entity29			1
the apple he is creating has been dubbed @entity77			0
@entity26 is the apple 's @entity79 genus name that means ‘ evil apple tree ’ , while ecclesia is @entity79 for church which works both in a religious sense , and represents the name of @entity10 ' lab. along with scientists and mathematicians @entity89 and @entity90 , @entity10 searched for years to find an of apple old enough for the project , and was sent the roots and leaves of the 4,000 - year - old strain at the end of last year			1
during the 30c3 conference in @entity98 in december , @entity10 said : ‘ i could n’t stop thinking and maths and @entity16			2
' i came up with a way to not only put one layer of information under a gene , but lots and lots of layers – like @entity109 dolls			2
‘ every dna molecule has three pages of information available			1
' this is because @entity16 can be represented by three unique numbers			0
one number is the @entity16 itself , the protein it ’s translated to creates another number , and then there ’s the redundant codons			0
along with scientists and mathematicians @entity89 and @entity90 , @entity10 is planning to add the top 50,000 pages of @entity9 , stock image pictured , to the fruit			1
this equates to 50 per cent of the most visited pages and contains around @entity127 data every dna molecule can be represented by three unique numbers , a slide taken from @entity10 ' recent conference talk in @entity98 is pictured			1
@entity10 will translate the words from @entity9 into the four letters of dna , then use bacteria to add these letters to the apple 's genome without affecting its taste ‘ so then i made this mathematical genetic code that let me write three layers of information using these numbers , inserting it under areas occupied by the redundant codons			1
‘ during the conference , @entity10 also said he wanted to ' create fruit that would tempt the devil			2
' @entity10 , pictured , won the @entity148 of the @entity149 in 2012			2
he previously inserted the words of a @entity152 philosopher into the genes of a fly due to the size of @entity9 , @entity10 and his team chose to decode only the top 50,000 pages of the online encyclopaedia , which make up 50 per cent of the most visited pages across the site			1
the amount of data equated to around @entity127			0
@entity10 told the @entity163 the apple genome is like a 750 million letter book , made up of the four letters of @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 the words are translated into these letters of @entity16 using a mathematical code , similar to how @entity60 and shorthand compress words to single marks			1
once coded , these letters are placed within the apple using bacteria that evolves to inserts its genome through the cell walls			0
by inputting the information into the gaps in the dna , @entity10 said t should n’t affect the taste or texture of the apple			1
@entity10 ’ first project , using a similar technique , was to put the writings of @entity152 philosopher , @entity188 into the genes of a fly			1
‘ [ the project ] draws together science and religion in very close proximity , ’ @entity10 continued			2
the fruit has also been dubbed forbidden because eating genetically modified plants in the @entity196 is strictly governed by the @entity196 @entity197			0
in the book of @entity199 , @entity3 were described as living with @entity200 in the @entity4			0
in the garden were two trees - the @entity203 , and the @entity204			0
the @entity205 claims @entity200 had forbidden eating fruit from these trees , but a serpent took an apple from the @entity203 and tempted @entity210 into eating it			0
she was then said to have consequently corrupted @entity3			0
@entity200 banished them from the garden to prevent them from eating more fruit , especially from the @entity204 which would have made them immortal			0
many @entity217 refer to this as the @entity219 and believe the sin corrupted the natural world and meant people were born into original sin , meaning believers ca n't attain eternal life without the grace of @entity200 .			0

the @entity26 ecclesia project is the brainchild of bio artist @entity10
he created a mathematical formula to add layers of information to dna
the top 50,000 pages of @entity9 will be added into the dna of an apple
@entity10 , 63 , used the roots and leaves of a 4,000 - year - old strain of apple to make it ' the closest fruit to that grown in the @entity4 '
the 63 - year - old previously coded @entity152 writing into the genes of a fly
