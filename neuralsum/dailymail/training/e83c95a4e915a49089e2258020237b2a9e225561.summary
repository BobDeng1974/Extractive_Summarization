by @entity0 a @entity2 fan has become an internet sensation after his tattoo of the singer looked more like @entity6 than the @entity8 star			1
the inking has been branded a ' tattoo fail ' by @entity12 actor @entity11 who tweeted : ' imagine all the wizards * '			2
the hilarious image was sent to a specialist @entity16 account that deals with unfortunate tattoos before going viral			0
imagine there 's no resemblance			0
it 's very easy if you try : an un-named @entity2 fan wanted to get a tattoo featuring the image of the former @entity8 star , right , but ended up with one looking like @entity6 , left social media users began immediately sharing the image including their own acerbic comments on the artwork			1
one @entity16 user called @entity31 said : ' it looks like @entity2 after a stroke			1
' a second , @entity34 added : ' @entity36 looks like @entity6 with a broken nose			2
' it is unlikely that the artist intended drawing the popular fictional wizard after including the word ' imagine ' and a peace sign underneath the dubious portrait			0
a charitable @entity44 said the image resembled ' a young @entity2 ' , although another user suggested @entity6 would be able to ' magic all the spots away '			1
the tattoo is being widely lampooned on @entity16 as it looks far more like @entity6 than @entity2 @entity49 , manager of the into you tattoo studio in @entity54 , @entity51 said : ' obviously this is the work of a very bad tattoo artist			1
it is unforgivable for a client to go in looking for an image of @entity2 and go home with @entity6			1
' before getting any tattoo a client should fully research the studio beforehand			0
there are very good studios with excellent artists			0
they will have extensive portfolios in the studio and in many cases online so you can assess the quality of this work			0
' in cases such as this , it is possible to get the tattoo removed by laser although that is incredibly expensive			0
maybe it would be cheaper for the person involved to buy a few @entity6 books and become a fan			2

the un-named man posted the *photograph* of his ' @entity2 ' tattoo online
soon internet wags noticed the almost *uncanny* resemblance to @entity6
one commentator *admitted* that it could have been a young @entity2
