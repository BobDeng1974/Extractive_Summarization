@entity0 battered @entity2 ’s students for 170 off 149 deliveries in his first game of red - ball cricket for 15 months – then insisted the incoming @entity7 chairman @entity6 has told him everyone has a ‘ clean slate ’			1
@entity0 ’s quest for an improbable return to international cricket began as his scriptwriter must have known it would : with sumptuous strokes , a standing ovation and much of the old bravado			2
the fact that his first hundred since the @entity17 against @entity18 in august 2013 came against a modest attack , at a windswept @entity2 , in a game not deemed first - class , is beside the point			1
@entity0 ’s only hope of playing for @entity26 again is to score lots of runs for @entity29 – wind , rain or shine			1
here was the first box ticked , in style			0
@entity29 's @entity0 ( right ) celebrates reaching his 100 during the three - day match at @entity35 @entity0 makes his way out to the crease following the dismissal of @entity39 it was the 34 - year - old 's first appearance for @entity29 since the @entity42 in june 2013 asked what @entity6 had said to him when the pair spoke over the phone last month , @entity0 replied : ‘ he said he wants the best players playing for @entity26 , and everyone has a clean slate			1
right now , it ’s just about me hitting the red ball			0
i think it can help @entity26 going forward			2
‘ i took confidence from the way i played in @entity18 [ at the @entity55 ]			0
it was as well as i ’ve ever batted			0
i ’ve been given a lifeline , and i have an opportunity to get back to doing something i love that was taken away from me prematurely			0
’ @entity26 meet @entity61 in @entity62 on monday , and comparisons will be inevitable			1
there will be mixed feelings both in the @entity66 and at @entity67			0
whether @entity0 ’s journey will prove more futile than fruitful is another matter			2
the first aim of the new regime at the @entity7 has been to stop the sniping ; the second may be to keep @entity0 sweet in case @entity75 cricket needs him after he retires , possibly in a mentoring capacity			2
regardless , the evidence here – as if it were required – suggested he is deadly serious about reclaiming his place			0
@entity0 has played exclusively @entity82 cricket throughout the world since being axed by @entity26 a young spectator points to a dent in her mother 's car made by one of @entity0 's shots @entity0 made 62 on his only prior appearance at @entity35 , for @entity91 in april 2004 with @entity29 122 for five at lunch , @entity0 ( left ) found himself on 47 not out from 58 balls nearly 10 years on from his ashes - clinching century at @entity95 , @entity0 can not have imagined he would need to prosper in the @entity96 simply to stay afloat			1
but in front of a crowd of several hundred – almost unheard of in these parts – and with @entity29 stumbling to 113 for five , he had a captive audience and a job to do			1
@entity0 was careful at first , waiting until his eighth delivery to pinch his first run in red - ball cricket since the @entity106 of january 2014 , and not finding the boundary until his 31st			1
his fifty came from 63 balls , his hundred from 110 , and his 150 from 137			2
by the time he was out for 170 , caught at mid-on off the bowling of @entity113 , a human sciences undergrad from @entity115 , the total was only 310			0
he knocked one spectator off his stool with a fierce drive , dented a @entity119 207 with the first of two successive straight sixes , and unveiled his full repertoire			0
stealing headlines and causing damage , @entity0 might never have been away			0
@entity0 's inclusion in @entity29 's line - up attracted several hundred spectators and a number of photographers			1

@entity0 scored a century for @entity29 against @entity131
the 34 - year - old scored an *impressive* 170 off 149 balls
it was @entity0 's first hundred since the @entity137 in 2013
