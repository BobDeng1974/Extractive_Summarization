by @entity1 reporter published : 09:19 est , 13 january 2014 updated : 09:27 est , 13 january 2014 the driver of the train that derailed in @entity6 last month , killing four people and injuring dozens more , had consistently been working a demanding overtime schedule in the years leading up to last month ’s fatal derailment , payroll records have shown			1
@entity11 , who has been suspended without pay since the crash , worked an average of 762 overtime hours per year in 2010 , 2011 and 2012 , according to @entity17 data			1
on the basis that @entity21 drivers work a typical 40 - hour work week of five eight - hour shifts , that 's the equivalent of working a sixth day every week for three years straight			2
@entity11 , who has been suspended without pay since the @entity21 crash in early december , has worked an average of six days a week for the past three years the reliance on overtime scheduling along the @entity28 has been described as ‘ shocking ’ by @entity30 rep. @entity29 , a @entity31 who represents the @entity33 district where the train derailed			1
as well as requesting payroll records for @entity11 , @entity35 @entity6 also requested information for 20 of the highest paid @entity21 engineers in 2010 , 2011 and 2012			1
they found that one train operator worked 1,183 overtime hours in 2011 , which works out to an average of 23 hours of overtime every week			1
another top overtime earner made a staggering $ 71,000 in overtime on top of $ 98,000 in regular pay in 2011			2
that works out to 1,222 overtime hours in a single year or the equivalent of working eight days a week			1
horrifying : the high - speed train derailment that killed four people has led the @entity17 to adopt several new safety measures the records show that @entity11 earned almost $ 45,000 in overtime pay in 2012 , almost double the $ 23,000 average for @entity21 engineers that year			1
union rules allow the most senior @entity21 train operators to have first claim on overtime hours , but this can lead to a handful of veteran engineers working extreme loads of overtime , while others get relatively few extra shifts			1
@entity29 has said that he will ask the federal government to make recommendations on reforming overtime rules for train operators			1
‘ it may be that people will have to be hired , because obviously if there are shifts people are working - all kinds of hours , day - in , day - out , month - in , month - out , year - in , year - out – it ’s not good for anybody , ’ he said			0
an @entity17 spokesman stressed to @entity35 that @entity21 fully complies with hours of service rules enforced by the @entity82			2
union rules allow the most senior @entity21 train operators to have first claim on overtime hours , but this can lead to a handful of veteran engineers working extreme loads of overtime @entity11 claims he fell into ' a hypnosis - like daze ' when his train ran off the rails along a curve on the outskirts of @entity6 while travelling at 82 mph at the beginning of december			1
his lawyer @entity95 said the engineer experienced a nod or ‘ a daze , ’ almost like road fatigue or the phenomenon sometimes called highway hypnosis			0
he could n't say how long it lasted			0
what @entity11 remembers is ‘ operating the train , coming to a section where the track was still clear - then , all of a sudden , feeling something was wrong and hitting the brakes , ’ @entity95 said			2
‘ ... he felt something was not right , and he hit the brakes			0
’ he called @entity112 ‘ a guy with a stellar record who , i believe , did nothing wrong			0
’ ‘ you 've got a good guy and an accident , ’ he said			0
‘ ... a terrible accident is what it is			0
’ @entity11 ‘ basically nodded , ’ said @entity122 , leader of the rail employees union , relating what he said the engineer told him			2
‘ he had the equivalent of what we all have when we drive a car , ’ @entity122 said			0
‘ that is , you sometimes have a momentary nod or whatever that might be			0
’ in the wake of the crash , investigators quickly determined that the deadly train derailment was not caused by any technical problems with the train itself as the driver had originally claimed .			0
