blessed with children as well as a career outside the home , working mums may seem to have it all			0
but actually they suffer a double guilt burden – that they are bad mothers because they work and bad employees because they have a family , a study shows			1
researchers found that working mothers agonised more about their job outside the office than fathers and had more negative thoughts about their family while at work			1
guilt : mother - of - four @entity20 ( with husband @entity21 and sons @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 ) admitted to vogue last year that she feels ' guilty ' every time she goes out to work both parents think about their families , but only for mothers is this type of thought associated with increased stress and negative emotions			1
@entity34 , an assistant professor in the @entity36 at @entity37 in @entity38 , studied mental labour in working parents in pressurised jobs			1
she defines the term as thoughts and concerns that can impair performance , make it difficult to focus on tasks , and even hurt our sleep			0
the study , presented to the @entity51 , relies on data from the @entity53 , which investigates how middle - class families balance family and work experiences			1
the study looked at 402 @entity58 mothers and 291 fathers in dual - earner families who completed a survey and a time and emotions diary			2
asst professor @entity34 found that working mothers engaged in mental labour in about one fourth of their waking time			0
working fathers spent one fifth of their working time engaged in it			0
this amounts to approximately 29 and 24 hours per week of mental labour for mothers and fathers , respectively			1
working guilt : @entity74 starred in the film ' @entity76 ' , playing ever - juggling working mother @entity77 however , mothers and fathers both spent about 30 percent of the time they were engaged in mental labour thinking about family matters			1
last year , @entity20 spoke of her guilt of going out to work			0
mrs @entity85 - mother to @entity25 , 14 , @entity23 , 11 , @entity24 , eight , and @entity87 , two , - admitted balancing her parenting duties with managing her clothing empire leaves her feeling ' constantly guilty '			0
speaking at @entity93 's @entity92 , the 39 - year - old , said : ' i think you feel so torn , do n't you ? but i 've got great people who handle my schedule and everything does revolve around the children			0
' commenting on her research , asst professor @entity100 said : ' what my research actually shows is that gender differences in mental labour are more a matter of quality than quantity			0
' i assume that because mothers bear the major responsibility for childcare and family life , when they think about family matters , they tend to think about the less pleasant aspects of it and are more likely to be worried			1
' asst prof @entity34 added : ' we know that mothers are the ones who usually adjust their work schedule to meet family demands , such as staying home with a sick child			1
' desperate to be with her ' : daybreak presenter @entity127 said last year that she ' suffered terribly from working mother guilt ' ' therefore , mothers may feel that they do not devote enough time to their job and have to ‘ catch up , ’ and , as a result , they are easily preoccupied with job - related matters outside the workplace			2
' this illustrates the double burden , the pressure to be " good " mothers and " good " workers , that working mums experience			0
' i thought that highly educated fathers holding professional and managerial positions would often be preoccupied with job matters when doing things such as housework or during their free time			2
' it appears , however , that fathers are quite adept at leaving their work concerns behind and are better able to draw boundaries between work and home			2
' i believe that fathers can afford to do that because someone else , namely their spouse , assumes the major responsibility for the household and childcare			0
' she added : ' it is true that fathers today are more involved in childrearing and do more housework than in previous generations , but the major responsibility for the domestic realm continues to disproportionately fall on mothers ’ shoulders and this has to change			2

mothers agonise more about their job outside work hours than fathers
they also worry more about family life while at work , say @entity38 researchers
this may be because fathers know their partner will worry on their behalf
