rare coins : one of the finds was a 17th century @entity26 ' cob ' ( left ) and another was a piece of eight ( right ) amazing find : the rare coins were recovered from @entity17 , which launched from @entity18 in 1697 but sank in 1707 off the @entity19 in what was called the ' greatest maritime disaster of the age ' remarkable : @entity32 head porter @entity31 poses with a piece of eight ( left ) and @entity26 ' cob ' ( right ) the @entity19 is known for having one of the highest concentrations of shipwrecks in the country , with 530 registered wrecks around the archipelago , but their most famous is the @entity17			1
@entity17 was a 96 - gun ship of the line weighing 1,459 tons and served as the flagship of naval officer sir @entity43 during the @entity44			1
the war , which involved various @entity47 countries including @entity14 , lasted from 1701 to 1714 and was fought over the feared joining of @entity26 and @entity48 under one monarch			2
@entity17 sank in 1707 when captain @entity50 was returning from the @entity51 with 20 other ships which entered the mouth of the @entity54			2
she struck the @entity56 off the @entity19 , and lost her entire crew of 800 men			0
it was believed that the ship had lost its way due to navigational errors			0
the wreck was left at the bottom of the ocean until it was dredged up in 1967 , and held many treasures - including the two pictured rare coins , which were the currency of pirates			2
one was a 17th century @entity26 ‘ cob ’			2
this unusually - shaped coin details the history of @entity26 , as the currency was cut crudely into shapes of an accurate weight in preparation for its melting down and usage in jewellery			1
also uncovered from the wreck was an example of the infamous ‘ piece of eight ’ , which was known as the world ’s first global currency , used across the @entity85 and often outside as well			1
the legacy of these coins endures , and in @entity92 ’s famous novel @entity90 , @entity89 ’s parrot had been trained to cry out ‘ pieces of eight ’			0
in @entity96 's @entity95 , a boy is sold for 60 pieces of eight , despite @entity99 admitting : ‘ i was very loth to sell the poor boy ’s liberty , who had assisted me so faithfully in procuring my own			0
’ a spokesman for @entity104 said : ' the sole association of pieces of eight and pirates has grown , and now they are commonly used in films such as the @entity109			0
' the piece of eight and @entity26 ' @entity112 ' coins are only expected to fetch up to £ 50 together , with the auctioneer telling @entity114 that this was a reflection of the price a wholesaler is likely to pay .			0
