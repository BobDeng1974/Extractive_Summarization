people who are friendly and open are typically more concerned about topics such as the environment , scientists have claimed / and now new research has shown that if enough people in a country have these traits , it can determine the ‘ personality ’ of an entire nation			1
in turn , this directly impacts on how environmentally - friendly that country is , and the measures it takes to protect and improve the planet			1
researchers from the @entity18 compared @entity20 ( @entity20 ) ratings for 46 countries to nation - level personality traits			1
it discovered that countries which scored high for agreeableness ( pictured ) had higher @entity20 ratings , and were therefore more environmentally - sustainable			1
@entity26 was the most agreeable , open and environmentally - friendly country ‘ we used to think that personality only mattered for individual outcomes , ’ said professor @entity27 from the @entity29 ’s @entity28 , ‘ but we ’re finding that population differences in personality characteristics have many large - scale consequences ’			1
professor @entity27 ’s previous work looked at how personality traits predict an individual ’s attitudes about the environment			0
the @entity41 ( @entity20 ) , developed at @entity42 and @entity43 , ranks countries across 20 environmental fctors , including co2 emission levels , use of renewable energy , and air quality			1
the two objectives of the index are @entity41 and @entity52			0
@entity41 measures the ' protection of human health from environmental harm '			0
while @entity52 measures ' ecosystem protection and resource management '			0
these two objectives are further divided into nine categories that cover issues , including air quality , forests , fisheries , and climate and energy , among others			0
underlying the nine issue categories are 20 indicators based on data and statistics taken from the records of individual countries			0
his latest study takes this research a step further , examining how those traits play out across whole nations			0
the study examined nation - level personality traits from a database of 12,156 people in 46 countries			1
national personality differences , reflecting average trait profiles of a country ’s residents , were t5hen used to predict scores on the @entity20 ( @entity20 )			1
the @entity20 , developed at @entity42 and @entity43 , ranks countries across 20 environmental indicators , including co2 emission levels , use of renewable energy , and air quality			1
higher scores on the @entity20 , reflecting more environmentally sustainable policies and practices , directly correlated with national levels of two personality traits			1
namely agreeableness , which reflects empathy and compassion , and openness , which suggests ' cognitive flexibility ' and the appreciation of objects and ideas			0
the countries featured in the study included @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity26 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 and the @entity156			2
@entity26 topped both the agreeableness and openness charts , and was also the highest ranking country on the @entity20			2
at the bottom end of the scale for agreeableness were @entity140 and @entity142 , which rank 81st and 134th from the list 178 countries ranked on @entity20			2
@entity127 , the @entity155 and @entity123 were high scorers on the openness scale and ranked 6th , 12th and 13th respectively for @entity20			2
these results highlight the psychological factors that can shape a nation ’s environmental policies , said professor @entity27			0
‘ not only can a person ’s attitudes about the environment be predicted from his or her personality traits , but the environmental practices of entire nations can be predicted from the personality profiles of their citizens ’			0
the @entity41 ( @entity20 ) , developed at @entity42 and @entity43 , ranks countries across 20 environmental indicators ( pictured ) including co2 emission levels , use of renewable energy , and air quality the study examined nation - level personality traits from a database of 12,156 people in 46 countries			1
@entity127 , the @entity155 and @entity123 were high scorers on the openness scale and ranked 6th , 12th and 13th on the @entity20 respectively ‘ previous research has linked higher levels of the personality traits agreeableness and openness with greater concern about environmental issues , ’ explained the researchers			1
‘ while these traits are important predictors of environmental attitudes among individuals , a growing literature has begun examining the broader consequences of population differences in personality characteristics			0
‘ the present study examines whether nationally aggregated personality traits can be significant predictors of a country ’s environmental sustainability			2
‘ just as agreeableness and openness predict environmental concern at the individual level , countries with higher population levels of agreeableness and openness had significantly better performance on the sustainability index			2

researchers compared @entity20 ( @entity20 ) ratings to nation - level personality traits
@entity20 ranks country *'s* based on 20 environmental factors including co2 emissions and use of renewable energy
national traits were taken from a database of more than 12,000 people across 46 countries
countries which scored high for agreeableness and openness also had higher ratings on the @entity20 scale
the @entity118 study claims this shows personality differences in populations have ' large - scale consequences '
@entity26 was the most agreeable , open and environmentally - friendly country according to the comparisons
