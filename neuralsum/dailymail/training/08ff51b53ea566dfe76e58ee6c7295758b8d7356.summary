by @entity0 less than 12 hours before i ’m due to have a c - section to bring my twin daughters into the world and i ’m on the phone to my younger sister @entity6 , begging her to come to my flat			1
sensing the urgency in my voice , she drives across @entity10 to be with me			0
like any mother - to - be , i want my babies to arrive safely			1
but i ’m also concerned that a vital piece of equipment , one that will smooth my ride into the first few days of motherhood , has broken			0
luckily my sister has a spare			0
a breast - pump , perhaps ? maybe a nappy - disposal system ? er no ... hair straighteners			1
less than 12 hours before she was due to have a c - section to give birth to her twin daughters , @entity28 ( pictured ) asked sister @entity29 to borrow her hair straighteners the fact that i was even thinking about my hair when my main focus should have been my babies came as no surprise to my family			1
for decades , they have listened to me moan about my mop of unruly curls			1
it ’s not only that it has more twists and turns than an underground map , but it ’s thicker than the entire cast of made in @entity44			0
if i was going to look anywhere near presentable in the post-partum snaps , it was going to need straightening			2
was i being ridiculously vain ? absolutely			0
but i also knew that by fighting the frizz , i ’d feel more in control as i embarked on the overwhelming journey into motherhood			0
it will come as no surprise that once @entity55 and @entity56 arrived , and were then whisked off to the special care unit because they were premature , i barely gave my hair a second thought			2
and since that day i can count on one hand the number of times i ’ve sported straight hair			1
as a result , i ’m finally coming round to the curly mane that used to be the bane of my life			1
like @entity28 , @entity69 has tried to hide her curly hair by straightening it seems i ’m not alone			1
earlier this week , fellow frizzhead @entity69 admitted that after years of loathing her curly hair , she is learning to love it			1
the @entity74 - winning actress said that her three - year - old daughter @entity76 has inherited her corkscrew ringlets and prefers it when her mother wears her hair au naturel			1
‘ i almost never straighten it any more ; i let it go curly and wild , ’ she said			2
‘ it ’s taken me 40 - something years , but i embrace the curl			2
’ the @entity74 - winning actress said that her three - year - old daughter @entity76 has inherited her corkscrew ringlets and prefers it when her mother wears her hair au naturel			1
i ’m approaching 40 and it ’s only since becoming a mum that i have appreciated my ringlets			0
it ’s not simply a question of saving precious time — although drying my hair curly takes five minutes whereas having it straightened takes about 45 minutes , a myriad smoothing products and , often , a hairdresser			1
no , it ’s because suddenly i ’m happier in my hair			2
the smooth look that gave me such confidence when i worked in a stressful office environment no longer reflects my personality or circumstances			0
life with two marauding toddlers is about as smooth as a @entity107 ferry crossing			2
curly , wild hair matches my circumstances			1
yes , it ’s slightly out - of - control , but it ’s more relaxed , less bothered about what others think about it			2
i inherited my bouncy hair from my father , @entity116 , whose dark head of curls has made him look like a cross between footballer @entity120 and comedian @entity121			1
my late grandmother — whose hair was wavy , but not the full frizz — blamed the fact that she ate walnuts throughout her pregnancy , which always made us laugh			2
as a baby , i had a mop - top of curls , but oddly in my early childhood my hair straightened out to a glossy reddish brown			1
then , in the @entity135 i had a bubble perm			0
as soon as i looked in the mirror i regretted it			0
sure enough , at school i earned a range of nicknames from @entity142 — the @entity144 cartoon character with wild hair — to @entity146 , the lion from @entity148			2
still , i felt sure it would grow out			0
@entity28 's perm left her looking like @entity152 except it did n’t			1
although perms are known to damage the hair , some experts believe the texture can also change during puberty thanks to hormones making each strand of hair thicken			2
what followed were years full of hair - angst			1
these were the days before serums banished frizz			0
i improvised with greasy concoctions of my own invention — one involving baby oil and @entity170			0
if any boys had shown any interest — and they did n’t — they would have had to approach me in protective clothing			0
at university , i had to leave it curly as i could n’t afford expensive hair products			1
but i ’d tie it back , up or even wear hats indoors			0
over the years the teasing continued , but i figured it was better to be talked about than ignored			0
it was during this time that hair straightening came into fashion			1
@entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187 all became purveyors of the poker - straight look			1
when i could afford it , i would get my locks smoothed professionally			0
suddenly , i noticed i was taken more seriously			0
@entity28 found she was taken more seriously when she straightened her hair it got me thinking about wavy hair and success			1
apart from interior designer @entity198 and the @entity200 founder @entity199 , there are few women with curls in positions of power			2
straight hair means straight - talking and i recall an interview with a female @entity208 reporter who said she straightened her hair as curly hair was n’t acceptable on air			1
apparently , newsreader @entity211 also religiously straightens her naturally frizzy hair			1
yet now , as i ’m coming around to the idea of leaving my hair as nature intended , it seems i ’m on trend			1
a survey of more than 2,000 women found that 74 per cent of those with wavy or curly hair say their look gets compliments			1
my husband @entity225 says my hair was one of the first things that attracted him to me and does n’t like it when i straighten it			2
my daughters also seem to prefer curly mummy to straight mummy			1
when they see pictures of me looking glossy and groomed , they look confused			0
when they see me with a wild mane , they smile and say : ‘ @entity235 ! ’ which melts my heart			0
@entity237 @entity69 , @entity28 will remain natural from now on for the sake of her daughters like @entity69 , i will remain natural from now on for the sake of my daughters			1
their baby - soft strands may be straight now but the curly gene is beginning to take hold at the edges			1
i want them to know that it ’s ok to be different			0
of course , it ’s inevitable that they will go through phases of hating their hair and i know i wo n’t be able to keep them away from straighteners for ever			2
but for now , i ’ll be steering clear			0
in a world so obsessed with fixing every flaw , i ’d hate for my girls to think they must iron out every imperfection just like mummy irons out her hair			2
making a mane of corkscrews look ‘ naturally beautiful ’ can be an awful lot of hard work			2
here are my top tips			0
tame the @entity267 brushing curls results in a cloud of fluff , but brushing before you get in the shower gets rid of tangles and means shampoo and conditioner work more effectively			2
try @entity278 ’s @entity277 ( £ 5.59 , boots.com ) which you can even leave in overnight			0
when it comes to the final rinse , curly - haired @entity281 , stylist at @entity10 ’s @entity278 salon , recommends tipping your head upside down and rinsing from the nape of your neck to the tips			1
‘ this stops the hair going flat at the roots , ’ she says			2
use a primer because of their shape , curls never looks as shiny as straight hair			1
sorry , laws of physics , flat surfaces reflect light better than curved ones			0
for a glossy look , try a primer			0
living @entity303 ( £ 18 , spacenk.com ) seals hair against water and the dreaded frizz , while @entity307 ( £ 24.75 , beautyflash.co.uk ) renders even the coarsest hair sleek			0
@entity281 suggests combing primer through using a @entity310 ( £ 10.20 , lookfantastic.com )			0
find a great gadget if , like me , you ’d rather not leave your curls to chance by letting them dry naturally , there are some excellent options			1
@entity319 ( £ 10 , thisisbeautymart.com ) are the modern version of rolling your hair with rags but with spiral tubes			0
@entity325 ’ @entity324 ( £ 119 , johnlewis.com ) might be pricey , but ca n’t be beaten			0
you clamp the gadget on a section of dry hair , then it winds the hair into the heated chamber and , releases a perfect curl			0
sleep in a @entity334 however you create curls , sparing use of a serum or oil is essential to give shine			0
my favourites include @entity342 ( £ 5.99 , boots.com ) and @entity343 ( £ 9.99 , boots.com )			0
to preserve your curls overnight , tie up your hair as high and as loose as possible — an old school scrunchie is ideal .			1
