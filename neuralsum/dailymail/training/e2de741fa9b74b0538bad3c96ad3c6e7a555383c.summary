@entity0 has reportedly been diagnosed with @entity2 's disease which may be the reason why control of the @entity4 has been handed over to his estranged wife @entity5			1
it was reported today that the contractual agreement that governs the team dictates that , since he and @entity5 each own half of the team , their health has to be ruled sufficient to rationally lead the team and @entity0 has been deemed mentally unfit			1
the disgraced owner is also suing the @entity15 for $ 1bn over the way the aftermath of his race row as been handled			0
the terms of the deal mandates that in order for one of them to be ruled incompetent , two doctors have to agree on the individual 's health and apparently that has happened to @entity0			1
company you keep : the scandal began when a love interest of @entity31 taped a racism - filled phone conversation ( @entity0 seen here with and unidentified woman on wednesday ) mental health : two doctors reportedly diagnosed @entity0 with @entity2 's disease which resulted in his wife @entity5 being given full control of their previously - jointly - owned team the 80 - year - old is believed to have met with two unidentified ' prominent neurologists ' earlier this month and they both concurred that he had alzheimer 's disease			1
their diagnosis stipulated that he may have had the degenerative neurological disease for up to five years			0
there are a number of implications beyond the disgraced team owner 's health that come with the diagnosis			2
@entity50 reports that the terms of the trust agreement that controls the team stipulates that if either of the @entity31 shows ' an inability to conduct business affairs in a reasonable and normal manner ' then they will have their controlling stake taken away			1
that may explain how , in spite of his earlier declarations in the immediate aftermath of the release of his racist recording , he handed over his controlling stake to his wife			0
however , his legal team could use the diagnosis to help him get it back by arguing that the decision to hand over the team should be invalidated because of his illness			0
out in public and out of his job : the bylines of the trust that was set up to control the team stipulate that if two doctors deem one of the owner 's health puts the team at risk , then they will be forced to hand over their portion ( @entity31 pictured on may 27 ) though the family has not confirmed these reports , it would fit with @entity89 's earlier statements that she was concerned that her husband had dementia since @entity2 's is a cause of that condition			1
earlier this month , she told @entity94 that when she asked @entity0 about the recordings , he said : ' i do n't remember saying that			2
i do n't remember ever saying those things			0
' ' ( @entity100 ) knocked their socks off , they bonded , had a good connection ' - an unidentified individual with knowledge about the @entity4 sale negotiations ' i said , " well , this is the tape			1
" and he says , " hmm			0
i do n't remember it			0
" that 's when i thought he had dementia , ' @entity5 said during the interview			1
it is also not the first time that his health has come into question since there were also earlier unconfirmed reports that @entity0 has prostate cancer			2
the news about his @entity2 's diagnosis comes hours after it was announced that @entity5 has signed a deal with former @entity125 ceo @entity100 agreeing that he will buy the team for $ 2billion			1
@entity89 said in a statement issued late thursday that she 'd signed a binding contract for a sale of the @entity4 by @entity130 to @entity100 in what would be a record deal if approved by the @entity15			1
@entity100 ' will be a terrific owner , ' @entity0 said			1
' we have worked for 33 years to build the @entity4 into a premier @entity15 franchise			0
i am confident that @entity100 will take the team to new levels of success			1
' basketball fan : @entity100 , pictured here in january shaking the hand of basketball icon @entity143 at a college game , said that he is excited to own the beleaguered franchise @entity125 money : @entity100 was the ceo of the computer company from january 2000 until february of this year ( pictured at the annual shareholder meeting in november ) @entity89 's statement noted that she made the deal ' under her authority as the sole trustee of @entity130 , which owns the @entity4 '			1
@entity0 's attorneys contend that he is a co-owner and therefore must give his assent for the deal to go through			1
they also say he wo n't be giving it			0
' @entity31 is not selling the team , ' said his attorney , @entity159			0
' that 's his position			0
he 's not going to sell			0
' @entity100 beat out bids by @entity162 and a group including former @entity15 all - star @entity164 after presenting an ' all - around superior bid , ' according to an individual with knowledge of the negotiations			2
the individual , who was n't authorized to speak publicly , said @entity100 made more than an hour - long personal visit to @entity89 's @entity171 home sunday and laid out his plan			2
' he knocked their socks off , they bonded , had a good connection , ' the individual said			0
the amount was also the largest of the offers , and @entity100 was one potential buyer to deal with rather than numerous members of a group			2
woman at the center : @entity0 was talking to @entity183 ( pictured today ) when he made the racist remarks @entity100 said in a statement that he is honored to have his name submitted to the @entity15 for approval and thanked the league for working collaboratively with him throughout the process			1

' it includes the line ' read and approved ' and @entity0 's signature			2
@entity159 said @entity0 has had a change of heart primarily because of ' the conduct of the @entity15			2
' he said @entity15 commissioner @entity224 's decision to ban @entity0 for life and fine him $ 2.5million as well as to try to oust him as an owner was him acting as ' judge , jury and executioner			1
' ' they 're telling me he should stand back and let them take his team because his opinion on that particular day was not good , was not popular ? ' @entity159 said			0
' it does n't make sense			0
he 's going to fight			0
' she 's the boss : @entity89 ( pictured in 2008 ) was put in charge of brokering the deal it 's unclear how the agreement will affect a special hearing of @entity15 owners planned for tuesday in @entity244 to consider the charge against @entity0 for damaging the league with his comments			1
a three - quarters vote of the 30 owners to support the charge would have resulted in the termination of both @entity31 ' ownership of the franchise			0
the deal is expected to be presented to the league before tuesday , according to the individual			0
silver has said his preference would be for the franchise to be sold rather than seized — and that means sold in its entirety , with neither @entity0 retaining a stake			2
though according to the deal 's terms @entity100 will own 100 percent of the team , @entity89 may continue to be involved under conditions worked out privately with @entity100 , the individual said			1

@entity100 and investor @entity282 headed a group that agreed to a deal to buy the @entity277 from the @entity286 in january 2013 with the intention of moving the team to @entity289 , where the @entity290 played until 2008			1
but @entity292 mayor @entity291 lobbied the @entity15 for time to put together a bid to keep the team in @entity296 , and though the @entity284 later increased its offer , owners voted to deny the bid for relocation and the @entity277 were sold to @entity275			0
