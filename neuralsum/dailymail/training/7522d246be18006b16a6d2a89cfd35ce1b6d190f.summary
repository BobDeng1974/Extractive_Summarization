by @entity0 published : 14:11 est , 17 january 2013 updated : 10:27 est , 18 january 2013 from snakes to lizards , geckos and even stick insects , the animal - loving @entity2 are n't afraid to take unlikely pets to heart			0
but the slimy jellyfish has confounded all attempts to domesticate it - until now that is			0
so delicate are the wobbly fish , attempts to keep them as pets have ended in death for the jellyfish thanks to the filters used in tanks for tropical fish			0
expensive : @entity22 's specially designed jellyfish aquarium comes complete with wibbly residents but now a @entity25 company has managed to design a filter - free tank , which comes complete with a family of moon jellyfish to enjoy			1
the world ’s first domestic aquarium designed specifically for the translucent medusas is available from @entity22 and comes fitted with led lights to brighten up the tank and its colourless occupants			2
the seven - gallon tank is circular in shape and uses a unique pump system to circulate water in a controlled swirl , nudging the fish gently away from the sides of the tank and clear of the dangerous filter valves			0
the specially designed jelly keeping kit costs $ 382 ( £ 238 ) plus vat and shipping charges , and includes the tank , a small family of moon jellyfish and a three ounce bag of specialist jellyfish food			1
although the website is based in @entity25 , it will fedex the jelly kit to the @entity2 , although it wo n't ship live jellyfish abroad			2
peaceful : watching moon jellyfish drifting about their business is said to have a soothing effect @entity22 sells the tanks and the moon jellyfish to go in them , as well as cleaner snails and hermit crabs @entity2 would - be jellyfish owners can pick up theirs from @entity67 , which will happily source moon jellyfish ( £ 65 each plus £ 95 overnight delivery charges ) and other marine life for @entity2 clients			1
the @entity2 company is also licensed to sell the tanks , although they cost a lot more than the @entity25 equivalent - £ 475 for a standard tank containing a single jellyfish			0
so are the translucent fish good pets ? according to @entity22 , they are a soothing , low maintenance alternative to tropical fish			2
a spokesman for the website said : ' i would have to have to say the fact that they are kind of ' exotic ' is probably a draw for a lot of people			0
' being one of the first to own a new thing			0
another thing i hear people mention is that they want them to be a form of relaxation and just sit around and watch the jellies float around			0
' the website also sells special jellyfish feeding kits , as the marine beasts ca n't survive on regular fish food			1
' @entity22 provides a @entity101 specifically formulated for jellyfish made from plankton high in @entity104 ( highly unsaturated @entity105 ) , which are essential for proper nutrition , ' adds the spokesman			2
' we strongly suggest only feeding jellyfish with our recommended food			0
other fish foods that claim to be suitable for jellyfish are often low quality			0
' but whether or not you feed your jellies the @entity117 mix recommended by @entity22 , your time as the proud owner of your very own jellyfish could be brief , as moon jellyfish are notoriously short - lived			1
the would - be pets survive less than two months in the wild , although they do replace themselves quickly - wild adult moon jellyfish produce larvae every day			1
if yours prove less fertile , @entity22 or @entity67 will send replacements but they do n't come cheap : a small jellyfish costs $ 39 ( £ 24 ) while a large one is $ 55 ( £ 34 ) plus postage and packaging			1
but be careful if you decide to replace your lost jelly with one of the site 's $ 5 hermit crabs			0
unlike the short - lived jellyfish , hermit crabs can live up to 32 years in captivity so you could find yourself with a pet for life ! 1			2
it does n't sting : unlike poisonous relatives such as the @entity144 man @entity143 , the moon jellyfish does n't sting			1
that ought to make cleaning the tank a bit easier ! 2			0
it only lives for six months in the wild : although wild moon jellyfish live for less than six months in the wild , they can live for several years in an aquarium if professionally cared for			1
although it 's transparent and tiny , it has four names : along with its latin name , @entity157 , @entity157 are also known as ' common jellyfish ' and ' saucer jellyfish '			2
moon jellyfish are found everywhere : the jellyfish are found in seas all over the world , including those that lap the @entity2 shore			1
if you do n't fancy splashing out $ 39 on an @entity25 jelly , you could always head to @entity170 , where moon jellyfish are regularly seen floating just off beaches and in harbours			1
it does n't have the ability to poo : the moon jellyfish is one of the world 's most basic animals and has very few body parts			1
although it has tentacles and four gonads , which it uses to digest its food and reproduce , it has no circulatory , respiratory or excretory systems .			0

jellyfish ca n't be kept in regular aquariums because they get sucked into the filter and *shredded* by the fan
@entity22 's aquarium includes special fans to blow them away to *safety*
unfortunately the *non-stinging* moon jellyfish that come with it only live for a *maximum* of six months
