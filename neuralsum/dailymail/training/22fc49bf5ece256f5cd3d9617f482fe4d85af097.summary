taken before and after @entity2 brought colossal devastation to @entity6 's @entity5 coast , these @entity1 satellite images show the massive impact hurricane - strength winds and storm surges had on the electricity infrastructure of @entity10 and @entity11			1
what were clear clusters of twinkling lights just a few days earlier were turned to great swathes of darkness by the ferocity of the storm as power lines and substations offered little resistance to the extreme elements			2
the photograph of the @entity24 was taken in the early hours of november 1 , two days after @entity2 made landfall near @entity26 in @entity11			1
the same area had been photographed by the @entity29 satellite on october 21 and clearly shows a much brighter @entity10 ( right ) , @entity30 ( centre ) and @entity32 ( left )			1
before and after : these @entity1 satellite images show ( left ) the @entity5 coast on october 21 before the storm and ( right ) on november 1 , after @entity2 struck while the centre of the cities remain illuminated , suburbs and more outlying areas have been plunged into darkness			1
interstate routes 444 and 18 which extend towards the @entity11 shoreline appear darker in the second image			2
in total , eight million people were left without electricity from @entity46 down to @entity47 , and as far inland as @entity48			1
it took several days to restore power to the @entity10 area , with at least 643,000 @entity10 clearing up from the storm in the dark			2
the lower half of @entity55 blacked out after an electrical substation close to the @entity57 blew up after being overwhelmed by flood waters			0
engineers had to wait for flood waters to recede before they could assess damage to electrical infrastructure , most of which is underground			0
enormous : this @entity1 satellite image taken on october 29 shows the magnitude of @entity2 as it was about to make landfall on the east coast of the @entity6 the view from space : this @entity1 clip shows a satellite tracking the progress of the superstorm as it bears down on the @entity6 above ground wiring knocked out by high winds and falling trees in other districts was repaired in less time			2
power firm @entity80 said 100,000 primary electrical wires were knocked down in the city and nearby @entity83 to the north , affecting about 810,000 people in total			0
in @entity48 , high winds knocked out power to more than 250,000 homes and in @entity89 , 1.2m went without power			0
freak snow storms affected supply in @entity93 and @entity94			0
@entity1 launched the @entity29 satellite on october 28 , 2011 from @entity96 in @entity97			1
in its first year , the satellite has orbited the @entity98 more than 5,000 times and is returning thousands of images which are being used to predict weather and climate patterns			0
eerie : large swathes of downtown @entity55 were plunged into darkness after @entity2 's high winds and water surges brought down power lines and flooded electrical subatations			0

the storm , which struck the @entity5 coast last week , left some 8 million people without electricity from @entity46 down to @entity47
these images , taken by the @entity29 satellite before the storm on october 21 and afterwards on november 1 show how the @entity10 and @entity11 area was plunged into darkness
