scientists believe that more than 100 dolphins washed up dead along the @entity3 coast were struck down by a killer strain of measles			1
a total of 101 dolphin carcasses have been counted on the west coast of @entity3 since the beginning of the year			1
all are the same species - striped dolphins which have a distinctive blue and white pattern and grow to about eight feet long			2
they usually live for 50 or 60 years			0
concerns : more than 100 striped dolphins have washed up on the west coast of @entity3 during the last three months the bodies have appeared on beaches spanning more than half the western coastline of @entity3 , from @entity19 to @entity20 , as well as the island of @entity22 - which suggests that the problem is not caused by humans pollutants such as oil			1
instead the deaths are being attributed to a possible outbreak of @entity28 , the virus that causes measles in humans , which scientists believe created a gateway for other illnesses among the animals			1
thirty - five per cent of the corpses tested positive for dolphin measles , @entity3 's @entity37 said			1
a statement from the ministry read : ‘ at the moment the suspected cause of the mass cetacean deaths is measles ( morbillivirus delphini ) and the bacterium @entity46			2
‘ the deaths could be caused by food shortages which weaken the animal making them more easily exposed to diseases and parasites			0
’ a similar epidemic decimated @entity56 dolphin populations between 2006 and 2008			0
bodies : the bodies have been found all along the @entity3 coast , from @entity19 in the north to @entity22 in the south the current strain has mostly affected young dolphins between the age of 15 and 20 , who have not come across the disease before			1
animals born after a 1990 - 92 epidemic are devoid of the antibodies needed to defend them against the disease , scientists said			0
none of the dead dolphins had food in their stomachs , which suggests that they may have starved to death because the virus left them weakened			1
overfishing which has left the @entity82 with sparse reserves of dolphin prey could also be a factor , the government agency said			0
striped dolphins feed on small prey including hake , cuttlefish , squid , mackerel and sole , all species subject to intensive fishing			0
the species is found in all the world ’s tropical oceans			0
they are very sociable , travelling in large pods which can include hundreds of dolphins and are among the most acrobatic breeds			0
there are thought to be around two million striped dolphins in the world .			2
