what we may be witnessing in these opening jousts of the season is the mental disintegration of @entity5 as a racing driver			1
his reaction to losing to @entity8 – blaming the @entity9 for slowing down and bunching him up as the attacking @entity10 of @entity11 closed on him – told us more about his own state of mind than it offered fair criticism of @entity8			1
@entity5 was , i thought , disgruntled by his failure to match his team - mate during a run of eight wins in the last 10 races			1
in those emotionally charged minutes after the @entity22 nothing seemed to make sense to him , rational thought was fuzzy and @entity8 appeared in his mind as a blurry figure of hate			1
@entity5 ( left ) looks less than impressed after finishing second to @entity29 team - mate @entity8 the @entity31 driver blamed @entity8 for slowing down and bunching him up as @entity11 closed in @entity5 ( left ) , @entity8 ( second right ) and @entity10 driver @entity11 celebrate on the podium in @entity34 it was all the more remarkable given that @entity5 was for so much of last season the ultimate expression of focus , coolness , intelligence and calculation			1
there was no chink in his well - tailored shell of composure			2
that changed in the aftermath of @entity47 last august , when @entity5 was punished by the team ( he was made to pay for the damage caused rather than fined as such , contrary to everyone ’s interpretation at the time ) for his part in an early crash with @entity8			1
@entity5 's attitude seems to have changed in the aftermath of his crash with @entity8 in @entity47 last august it was my view then and remains so that @entity5 was marginally more to blame for the collision , but that it was no more than a racing incident			1
they did not penalise either man			2
yet , @entity29 made @entity5 a very public scapegoat , denting his confidence at a crucial moment in the season			1
@entity8 immediately seized the initiative , which he has never ceded in the slightest measure from that day to this			1
when on form , @entity8 is an extraordinary racer , maybe utterly unbeatable			1
and he is on form now , perhaps more so than ever in his life			2
that must eat at @entity5 ’s heart			1
i am not writing off the @entity31 quite yet			2
i believe he is far tougher than his nickname @entity78 , as in @entity79 , suggests			2
he can be ‘ nasty ’ as @entity80 said of him			2
we can all recall examples of his cunning			0
but he is at a fork in his career , it seems			0
for if he can not find a way to beat @entity8 soon , he could ebb away as @entity88 did at @entity89			1
@entity88 , a feisty competitor and a talented driver , was a genuine threat to @entity11 in their first season fighting for the title , as @entity5 was to @entity8 in their intitial championship contest			1
but that was it for @entity88			0
@entity11 soon took total command , and his one - time rival was left to complain about his supposedly unfair treatment by the team , before fading into the distance and finally into retirement from @entity105			0
the 17 - year - old @entity107 driver @entity106 showed he has what it takes my highlight of the @entity22 was the pure , instinctive racing of @entity106			1
his ability to go on the inside of his prey and brake at precisely the last moment was remarkable craftsmanship from a boy of 17			2
it reminded me of @entity122 ’s tribute when a young , floppy haired @entity124 began his @entity126 career with a nonchalant four			0
‘ oh , what a princely entry , ’ he growled			0
@entity128 recently highlighted that commentators ' do n’t fully understand ' technical terms @entity105 has a greater than average obsession with its own navel			0
it never stops asking where it can improve itself to an extent that must bore any outsider to distraction			0
over complicating the whole sport is an associated abomination that has increased in recent years through saturation coverage on television and the internet			0
every smart aleck wants to show just how clever he is , however slight his underlying knowledge of the sport may be			0
@entity128 recently picked up on this phenomenon , saying : ‘ commentators explain for an expert audience and not for people wanting to have an entertaining afternoon in front of their tellies			0
‘ and many times these commentators hide behind technical terms because they themselves do n’t fully understand what is going on			0
’ the nadir of this nerdy jargon is surely the description of tyres as ‘ prime ’ and ‘ option ’ , terms that even the suppliers , @entity165 , wanted discontinued			0
so , to clarify : super soft tyres are always known as the ‘ option ’ tyres , when they are in use , which they are not always ; softs can be ‘ prime ’ or ‘ option ’ , so can mediums , though hards are ‘ prime ’ whenever they are available , which they are not always			0
it could n’t be clearer , could it ?			0

are we seeing a mental disintegration of @entity5 as a racing driver ?
last season @entity5 was the *epitome* of focus , intelligence and calculation
since his @entity47 collision with @entity8 his composure has *diminished*
@entity106 , 17 , impressed with classy driving ability in @entity34
@entity5 : attempting to *overtake* @entity8 could have cost me second
