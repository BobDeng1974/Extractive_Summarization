@entity0 , 18 , was diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disease at age 17 every night after her family meal , @entity4 went to her bedroom where she stayed alone for the rest of the evening			1
but the teenager was n't being moody - she was embarrassed			0
from the age of 13 she 'd suffered from gastric reflux and within a few years it occurred whenever she ate or drank , coming up for as long as two hours afterwards			1
' it was really unpleasant , ' recalls @entity0 , 18 , a student at @entity13			1
at 17 her condition was properly diagnosed - she suffers from gastroesophageal reflux disease ( @entity2 ) , characterised by heartburn , burping and nausea ( although she did n't have these symptoms ) , and regurgitating food			1
also called acid reflux , it is largely considered an adult 's disease , with one in five adults suffering from it at least once a week			1
but about 5 per cent of children and teenagers experience these same symptoms on at least a monthly basis			0
@entity2 causes stomach acid to spill up the oesophagus ( gullet )			2
usually it 's due to weakness of the lower oesophageal sphincter , the valve at the bottom of the oesophagus that lets food into the stomach and closes afterwards to ensure acid does n't leak back up			1
long term , @entity2 can damage the cells in the gullet 's lining , increasing the risk of @entity48 's oesophagus			1
this condition affects one in ten people with @entity2 and one in 200 people with @entity48 's goes on to develop oesophageal cancer			1
two weeks ago the @entity54 on @entity56 campaign was launched , urging people with heartburn most days for three weeks to visit their doctor because this can be a sign of oesophagael or stomach cancer			0
the rise in childhood obesity means more young people are suffering with acid reflux , says @entity67 , a consultant gastroenterologist at @entity68 , @entity69			2
' if the stomach is overfilled it makes more acid , so more can leak upwards , ' he says			0
he says : ' often adults with acid reflux realise they had it during childhood without knowing what it was			2
and even gps do n't always recognise that children and young people can suffer acid reflux , delaying their treatment			2
often the symptoms can be vague			0
but acid reflux should be considered by @entity88 if children experience pain when eating or when they wake up			0
' ( acid is more likely to splash back up the gullet in a horizontal position			0
) in july 2014 she underwent a keyhole procedure to place a ' bracelet ' of magnetic beads around the lower part of her oesophagus			0
the device , called the @entity107 , is available privately and on the @entity108 @entity2 is different from the kind of reflux affecting newborns			1
here the lower oesophagael sphincter relaxes at the wrong time , allowing acid to rise up the gullet ; this tends to resolve itself when children start to walk - ' being in a upright position helps the food go down more easily , ' says dr @entity67			2
in january , the @entity121 ( @entity121 ) published guidelines for doctors , stressing the need to differentiate between infant reflux and @entity2 ; they should also review a child 's symptoms if regurgitation becomes more serious and refer them to a specialist			1
as professor @entity130 , the director for the centre for clinical practice at @entity121 , pointed out : ' if not treated , gord can lead to malnutrition in children , cause ulcers in the oesophagus and can have psychological effects on a child 's relationship with food			0
' @entity0 underwent a barrage of hospital tests to find out what was wrong after first seeing her gp at 15 , including gastroscopies - where an endoscope ( a tube with a camera at the end ) is inserted into the stomach to inspect it			2
she was given the same treatments as adults - antacids to neutralise stomach acids , then proton pump inhibitors , drugs that suppress the amount of acid the stomach produces , but neither helped			0
by 17 @entity0 had lost about a stone in two years ( she 's 5ft tall ) , because eating had become so difficult , and her parents decided to see a private gastroenterologist			1
he carried out a gastroscopy and another test , which involved squirting water down her throat			0
they revealed @entity0 's lower oesophageal sphincter muscle had no strength , though she was told there was no reason for this			1
and no @entity108 doctors had previously even mentioned the muscle			0
in july 2014 she underwent a keyhole procedure to place a ' bracelet ' of magnetic beads around the lower part of her oesophagus			0
the pressure of the food passing down the gullet gently pushes the beads apart ; but the magnetic pull prevents food passing back up			0
the device , called the @entity107 , is available privately and on the @entity108 at four hospitals in @entity69 and one in @entity189			2
' after surgery the team wanted me to use the muscle by eating soft foods which were easier to go down , ' says @entity0			1
' when it did n't come back up i felt very emotional , knowing i could eat normally again			0
' dr @entity67 warns it may be too early to know how effective the @entity107 band is long term but added it was ' promising ' as two - thirds of patients have come off other medication			1
@entity0 , who lives with fellow students in term time , says : ' i would n't have been able to go to university without the procedure - it 's transformed my life			2

@entity4 , 18 , suffered from gastric reflux since she was 13
at 17 she was diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disease ( @entity2 )
@entity0 's lower oesophageal sphincter muscle had no strength
the student at @entity13 had a @entity107 band fitted
