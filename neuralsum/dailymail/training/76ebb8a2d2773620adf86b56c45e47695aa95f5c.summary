by @entity0 published : 05:43 est , 28 may 2013 updated : 07:18 est , 28 may 2013 travellers are finally fleeing the infamous @entity3 site they fought for more than a decade to defend as they say the former greenbelt site is contaminated with raw sewage			1
@entity3 residents had fought a 10 - year legal battle with @entity8 in @entity9 to defend their right to live illegally on the six - acre site in @entity12 , @entity9			1
hundreds of police and bailiffs were mobilised in october 2011 as part of a £ 7.1million eviction but despite the costly action a large number of touring caravans continued to line the road leading into the site			1
' filthy ' : a line of caravans parked along an access road near the @entity3 camp , which has allegedly become rat - infested and covered in excrement action : travellers and protesters manoeuvre a caravan to block a road during the eviction of @entity3 last year , as residents complain about conditions there it is alleged families have no access to toilets which has resulted in the site becoming infested with rats and covered with human excrement			1
illnesses such as impetigo , chickenpox and diarrhoea are rife and children have been struck by bouts of vomiting since the £ 7.2million eviction operation 12 months ago , an @entity45 report said last year			0
but now travellers are exiting in their droves after suffering health problems due to their poor living conditions			0
@entity58 , a campaigner for the travellers , said : ' most of them have left			0
' the conditions left by the council after the eviction , with raw sewage still leaking , has led to a lot of illness			1
' some have gone to @entity68 and others to @entity70 to stay with family			0
' they will be coming back though because they ca n’t stay there indefinitely			0
' infamous : the work of police and bailiffs to move in on @entity3 led to protesters setting fire to tyres and wood at their barricades row : @entity3 has been at the heart of a decade - long battle between @entity8 and travellers travellers who had continued to live illegally on the roadside had previously complained of a lack of electricity , running water and toilet facilities			1
the complaints came despite enforcement notices from the council last july demanding they leave the roadside immediately			0
the enforcement notices prompted failed appeals to the @entity95 and @entity96 although legal action is still believed to be on - going despite the exodus from the site			2
refusal : despite costing the taxpayer £ 7.1m , people have not all left the area councillor @entity104 , leader of @entity8 , said : ' the travellers have asked for their application to be heard in open court by another judge			2
' we will not take action until the outcome of that			0
' an @entity114 report into dangerous contaminants - including asbestos and engine oil - at @entity3 is expected to be published in the coming months .			2
