by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:27 est , 10 july 2013 updated : 05:43 est , 11 july 2013 suspended : consultant obstetrician @entity2 is being investigated by the @entity3 a surgeon has been suspended over fears that he botched the operations of hundreds of women			1
@entity2 , a consultant obstetrician , is being investigated by the @entity3 after it emerged that he may have made potentially life - threatening errors during routine operations			1
hospital bosses have written to 2,000 women who have undergone surgery with mr @entity2 in the past ten years warning them that their treatment is under review			1
an initial investigation has found he made some form of mistake in a quarter of all procedures			1
such a rate could mean that up to 500 women have suffered under his hands			2
mr @entity2 , 60 , had worked at @entity25 ’s hospital , @entity26 , @entity27 , since 2002 and also practised at @entity28 ’s and @entity30 ’ hospitals in central @entity27			1
he specialised in procedures including hysterectomies , the removal of cancerous tumours , screening for cervical cancer and caesareans			2
he also worked for several private @entity27 hospitals including the @entity38 , the @entity39 and the @entity40 in @entity41			0
concerns were raised last year when a routine audit of his operations at @entity25 ’s revealed an abnormally high number of complications among patients			2
the hospital subsequently reviewed the treatment of 255 of his most recent patients and found that mistakes had been made in 66 cases			1
these included 17 women where there was a ‘ serious cause for concern ’			2
some are believed to have suffered a perforated bowel , which is fatal in 10 per cent of cases			0
concern : the investigation began after a routine audit of mr @entity2 's work at @entity67 in @entity26 , @entity68 the hospital would not confirm whether any women had died and it said it was too early to say how many had been harmed			1
the women have been told that their medical records will be checked to see if there is any evidence they suffered complications caused by incompetence			1
most of the women had surgery several years ago and the hospital played down the chance that some had been harmed without yet being aware anything was wrong			1
however , women will be urged to come forward for treatment to correct any mistakes that may have occurred			0
only last month the @entity88 began publishing the death rates of thousands of surgeons amid concerns that badly - performing doctors are being allowed to make mistakes unnoticed			0
mr @entity2 also worked at @entity94 in central @entity27 mr @entity2 was suspended in november last year when concerns were first surfaced			1
he is now being investigated by the @entity3 , which could decide to strike him off the register			0
the watchdog has temporarily banned him from carrying out any private work			0
@entity25 ’s hospital is run by @entity100 , which last year became the first @entity88 trust to be put into administration after accumulating debts of £ 150million			0
dr @entity104 , its medical director , said : ‘ it is unlikely that patients will need treatment			0
but it ’s important that we review the relevant patient notes to check whether anything went wrong , to acknowledge any mistakes that may have happened , and – if necessary – to put things right			0
‘ all surgery involves risk and can lead to complications			0
but wherever we find cause for concern it ’s important that we explore the reasons for this			0
that ’s why we have written to the women concerned and explained that we will be reviewing their clinical notes			1
’ emerging from his large detached home in @entity127 , @entity128 , last night , mr @entity2 refused to comment			2
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
