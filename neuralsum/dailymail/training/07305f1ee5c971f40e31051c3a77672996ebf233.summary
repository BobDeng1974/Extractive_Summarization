by @entity0 published : 16:38 est , 12 march 2013 updated : 16:47 est , 12 march 2013 a forced kiss will no longer be considered rape in the @entity4 , a court ruled today			1
the @entity4 @entity5 narrowed its definition of rape , saying that a ‘ forced tongue kiss ’ should no longer be regarded among the worst forms of sexual assault			1
the ruling came as the court overturned a rape conviction of a 36 - year - old @entity4 who forced his tongue into a woman 's mouth in a hospital toilet			2
overturned : a ' forced tongue kiss ' will no longer be considered rape in the @entity4 while still illegal , a ' forced kiss ' is not as serious as forced sexual intercourse , and should be considered indecent assault , the court ruled			1
it reversed a 1998 @entity5 decision that broadly defined rape as any form of unwanted sexual penetration			1
the judges ruled that a forced kiss should be considered an indecent assault , a crime which carries a maximum sentence of eight years in the @entity4 , as opposed to rape , which has a maximum 12 - year sentence			1
lawyers for the 36 - year - old welcomed the ruling , saying that defining a forced kiss as rape could have serious consequences if a person is convicted			2
‘ if a person has to judge whether somebody is eligible to work in health care , for example , and sees that the person has a rape conviction , then nine times out of ten he wo n't be considered suitable , ’ lawyer tjalling van der @entity51 said			0
‘ the effects ( of a conviction ) can be much more severe than they should be			0
’ new rule : although previously broadly defined as any form of unwanted sexual penetration , the definition of rape as a crime in the @entity4 will no longer include ' forced kiss ' the case will now be sent back to a lower court for reconsideration			1
the man involved denies he forcibly kissed the victim			0
legally defining rape has been open to interpretation in several @entity69 courts			0
neither @entity72 not @entity71 courts would qualify a forced tongue kiss as rape			2
in @entity76 , it qualifies as rape , although is rarely prosecuted as such			0
@entity4 groups dealing with victims of sexual abuse have yet to comment on the ruling .			0

@entity5 overturned rape conviction where man ' forced tongue kissed ' woman
reversed 1998 ruling defining rape as any unwanted sexual penetration
' forced kiss ' to be considered indecent assault , say @entity4 @entity5
