@entity0 is teaming up with @entity2 - based aerospace firm @entity1 to create a supersonic jet that can fly from @entity4 to @entity5 in three hours and from @entity6 to @entity7 in six			1
the @entity9 business jet will fly at 1,217 mph , using proprietary supersonic laminar flow technology - almost as fast as @entity11 , which flew at 1,350 mph			1
the two companies announced this week that they will be joining forces on the project , sharing ' capabilities in design , manufacturing and certification '			0
supersonic : the @entity9 jet will use proprietary supersonic laminar flow technology , flying at 1,217 mph engineers from @entity0 ' @entity23 will work with @entity1 at its base in @entity25 , @entity26			1
the cost of the @entity9 is thought to be more than $ 100million - over £ 60million - and @entity1 hopes test flights will begin by 2019			1
the jet , which will fly between major global cities , will be made mostly from carbon fibre composite material			0
the cost of the @entity9 is thought to be more than $ 100million - over £ 60million - and test flights will begin by 2019 design features include wings which reduce overall drag by 20 per cent , allowing for lower fuel consumption and longer range and a luxurious 30 - foot - long cabin will seat up to 12 passengers			1
@entity1 chairman @entity40 , said in a statement : ' this is a major step forward for @entity1			0
it puts us solidly on track toward our objective of certifying the world 's first supersonic business jet in 2021			2
' after 27 years of service , @entity49 retired the @entity0 ' concorde airliner - which travelled at more than twice the speed of sound - in ocotber 2003 , signalling the end of the supersonic passenger jet			2
@entity55 : a 30 - foot - long cabin will seat up to 12 passengers in business - style comfort modern commercial long - haul jets typically cruise at speeds between 480 and 560 mph the plan is to certify the plane in 2021 with first delivery in 2022			1
flight testing would begin in roughly 2019			0
@entity1 officials knew it would take a well - established original equipment manufacturer to complete the project , he said			2
' we could n't be more delighted with the choice of @entity0 , ' @entity68 said			0
' we think that their footprint around the world is clearly going to help us as we develop the airplane			0
' flight testing could begin on the supersonic jet as early as 2019 with it becoming available in 2021 @entity77 has been open about his personal mission to offer the first business jet to fly faster than the speed of sound , a project begun in 2002			1
@entity1 , chief executive officer @entity82 , told @entity83 : ' the collaboration with @entity0 was an essential piece in order to bring the expertise of a premier aircraft development concern into the fold			0
' the @entity2 forbids civilian planes from the sound barrier - about 750 mph per hour - while flying overland due to noisy sonic booms , but the @entity9 model will fly at subsonic speeds until it reaches the ocean , when it will speed up			2
over @entity97 it can fly at supersonic speeds without detection .			0

@entity1 hopes test flights for @entity9 supersonic business jet will begin by 2019
flies 1,217 mph compared to *regular* planes which fly between 480 - 560 mph
a luxurious 30 - foot - long cabin will seat up to 12 passengers
