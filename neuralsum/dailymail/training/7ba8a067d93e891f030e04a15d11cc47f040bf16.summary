@entity0 suspended @entity1 indefinitely friday after a judge said the former champion almost surely choked and beat a former girlfriend last fall and there was a ' substantial likelihood ' of more domestic violence from him in the future			1
in a stunning move two days before the season - opening @entity12 , @entity0 said @entity1 would not be allowed to participate in any series activities until further notice given the ' serious nature of the findings and conclusions ' made by a @entity19 judge involving the driver known as @entity21			1
@entity23 commissioner @entity22 concluded that it was more likely than not that @entity1 abused @entity25 by ' manually strangling ' her and smashing her head into a wall inside his motorhome at @entity29 last september			1
busch attorney @entity45 said the driver will appeal , and @entity0 said it will be expedited			2
still , @entity40 said @entity47 will drive @entity1 's car in the @entity12 regardless of the appeal outcome			1
' we assure everyone , including @entity0 , that this action against mr. @entity1 will turn out to be a travesty of justice , apparent to all , as this story continues to unfold , ' @entity45 said in a statement			1
' it is important for everyone to remember that the commissioner 's report has to do with a civil , family law matter and no criminal charges have been filed against mr. @entity1			2
' @entity1 becomes the first driver suspended by @entity0 for domestic violence			1
chairman @entity64 had maintained the series would let the process play out before ruling on @entity1 's eligibility - and the series came down hard in finding that he committed actions detrimental to stock car racing and broke the series ' behavioral rules			2
@entity73 , who qualified second for friday night 's @entity75 race , was arrested and charged with assault of his wife in 2013			0
@entity0 took no action against @entity79			2
@entity80 immediately suspended its relationship with @entity1			2
a short time later , on the glass outside of @entity1 's garage stall at @entity12 , someone had scrawled in black marker ' # 41 @entity86 , ' a reference to the former @entity88 running back whose own case of domestic violence dominated much of last year			1
@entity1 drives the no. 41 @entity80			0
@entity25 ( left ) arrives for her protective order hearing against @entity1 ( right ) at @entity93 in december driver @entity1 , left , gives his new girlfriend @entity96 a kiss on feb. 15 the 36 - year - old @entity1 has denied the alleged assault , which is the subject of a separate criminal investigation , but the judge said @entity25 's version of the incident was more credible than @entity1 's			1
@entity25 said she was never motivated to have @entity1 punished by @entity0			1
' i reported a crime , just like anybody else who has been abused should do , because no one is above the law , ' @entity25 said			0
' i 'm very encouraged that @entity0 is taking steps to recognize that domestic violence is a serious issue , and i hope that we see them develop a very clear policy on it			1
' she urged @entity0 to develop a confidential reporting mechanism that partners of drivers could use to report domestic abuse without fear of threats or reprisals for coming forward			1
' @entity0 has made it very clear to our entire membership and the broader industry that any actions of abuse will not be tolerated in the industry , ' @entity0 executive vice president @entity122 said			1
' i want to make it clear that any inference that there 's a culture or a tolerance for this type of behavior is patently false			0
' @entity1 and @entity25 on the red carpet for the @entity138 in december 2013 it was the weekend of the first elimination race , at @entity29 , where @entity25 alleged @entity1 assaulted her in his motorhome			1
she said she drove to the track out of concern for @entity1 , who sent her alarming text messages following a poor qualifying effort			0
she said the two argued in the bedroom section of the motorhome before he slammed her head against a wall three times			0
@entity25 did not file charges until november , and the @entity19 attorney general has not decided if @entity1 will be charged			1
but @entity25 sought a no - contact order , and the couple spent four days over december and january in a @entity19 court presenting their sides			0
at one point , he accused of her of being a trained assassin			0
@entity22 noted that @entity25 presented false testimony that conflicted with that of a chaplain who saw her immediately after the alleged assault and said he did n't see any marks or bruises on her			0
@entity22 nevertheless said he did n't believe @entity25 's false testimony amounted to perjury or intentional falsehood			0
the judge concluded that @entity1 did not appear to be a prototypical batterer who uses violence to subjugate or control , but that the incident instead was most likely a " situational " event in which @entity1 was unable to cope and to control his tendency to act out violently in response to stress and frustration , causing him to " snap			1
" at the same time , however , @entity22 said he believes there 's real possibility that @entity1 will lash out again			0
@entity22 added that because @entity1 has a propensity to lose control in response to disappointing or frustrating situations involving racing and that those who love him are likely to be around him at those times " there is a substantial likelihood of acts of domestic violence by respondent against future intimate partners			1
" @entity1 's attorneys filed a motion thursday asking @entity22 to re-open the hearing so that they can present testimony from three acquaintances of @entity25 who they say were previously reluctant to get involved but have now come forward to contradict statements @entity25 has made about her relationship with @entity1			1
it is @entity1 's third career suspension			0
he was suspended in 2012 by @entity0 for threatening a reporter , and parked for the final two races of the 2005 season by @entity208 after he was pulled over by police in @entity210			2
he now races for @entity40			0
the 2004 @entity0 champion has 25 career wins , but only one since 2011			0
it came last year , his first season with @entity40 , the team that helped resurrect his career			2
team co-owner @entity217 hand - picked @entity1 to drive a car paid for out of pocket by @entity217 because the machine tool manufacturer wanted to see a driver take his company to victory lane			2
@entity1 was fired at the end of 2011 by @entity226 for a series of on - and off - track incidents , and he spent two seasons driving for low - budget teams before @entity217 extended the olive branch			0
@entity1 had been on a resurgence of sorts at @entity40 , which allowed him to compete in both the @entity234 and the @entity235 on the same day last year			2
he finished sixth at @entity236 last may and was named rookie of the race			0
but his season began to unravel late last summer as his performance tailed off			0
although he made the @entity241 for the @entity243 championship , he was eliminated after the first round .			0

@entity0 has suspended @entity1 after a domestic abuse incident that allegedly took place last fall
a judge ruled @entity1 ' manually strangled ' his ex @entity25 , and there is a ' substantial likelihood ' of more domestic violence from him in the future
' @entity1 and his @entity40 team are fully aware of our position and why this decision was made , ' @entity0 said in a statement
