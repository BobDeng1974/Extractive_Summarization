by @entity0 published : 18:57 est , 24 september 2013 updated : 18:57 est , 24 september 2013 @entity1 has emerged from his self - imposed silence of seven months to deny covering up the sexually abusive priests scandal and defend @entity4 to non-believers			1
the emeritus pope released a letter to one of @entity10 's best - known atheists , which was his first work published since he retired - and his first - ever denial of personal responsibility for the sex scandal			1
but what made the letter published yesterday in @entity10 's @entity17 more remarkable was that it appeared just two weeks after @entity18 penned a similar note to the newspaper 's atheist editor			1
in and out : @entity18 ( left ) and pope @entity22 pray together in @entity23 , @entity10 , in march it gives evidence that the two men in white , who live across the @entity28 gardens from one another , are of the same mind about the need for such dialogue and may even be collaborating on it			2
the @entity28 said the letters ’ appearance was just a coincidence			0
@entity1 wrote his to mathematician and atheist @entity38 , who in 2011 penned a book titled ‘ @entity22 , i 'm writing to you			1
’ the book was mr @entity38 's reaction to @entity1 's classic ‘ @entity43 ’			2
in his book , mr @entity38 posed a series of arguments about @entity47 , including the sex abuse scandal			1
for nearly a quarter of a century , the former cardinal @entity22 headed the @entity28 's @entity49 , the @entity28 office responsible for handling abuse cases			2
he was prefect when the scandal first exploded in the @entity52 in 2002 and was pope when it erupted on a global scale in 2010 with revelations of thousands of victims in @entity57 and beyond			2
it emerged bishops had covered up for paedophile priests and @entity28 officials turned a blind eye to the crimes - in some cases actively interfering with bishops trying to report paedophiles to police			0
in his letter , @entity1 denies responsibility			1
‘ i never tried to cover these things up , ’ he wrote			0
greetings : @entity18 ( left ) meets pope @entity1 ( right ) xvi in @entity23 in march			1
@entity1 has emerged from his self - imposed silence to publish a lengthy letter to one of @entity10 's most well - known atheists ‘ that the power of evil penetrated so far into the interior world of the faith is a suffering that we must bear , but at the same time , we must do everything to prevent it from repeating , ’ he wrote , according to @entity17			1
‘ neither is it comforting to know that , according to research , the percentage of priests who commit these crimes is n't any higher than the percentage of other similar professions			0
‘ regardless , one should n't present this deviation as if it were something specific to @entity47			0
’ as prefect , @entity22 in 2001 compelled bishops around the world to send all credible cases of abuse to his office for review			0
' i never tried to cover these things up			0
that the power of evil penetrated so far into the interior world of the faith is a suffering that we must bear ' emeritus pope @entity1 he took the move because it had become clear to him that bishops were merely shuffling abusive priests around , rather than subjecting them to church trials			2
he actually tried in 1988 to get around the cumbersome church trials , asking the @entity28 's legal office for quicker ways to permanently remove priests who raped and molested children			0
but he was rebuffed , with the legal office saying that doing so would compromise the priests ' ability to defend themselves			0
@entity22 was hamstrung by @entity118 's unspoken policy against letting young men leave the priesthood and his overriding concern with preserving the rights of accused clerics , often at the expense of victims			0
this was a concern formed in part by his experiences in communist - controlled @entity130 , where priests were often accused of trumped - up charges			0
eventually , a year after the abuse scandal exploded in the @entity52 , @entity22 pushed through administrative changes in 2003 and 2004 that enabled his office to permanently remove abusers without going through a church trial			1
big problem : the former cardinal @entity22 ( left ) was hamstrung by the unspoken policy of @entity118 ( right ) against letting young men leave the priesthood but that decision came decades after his office began receiving a steady stream of documentation about the scale of abuse in the @entity52 - far too late , according to victims			2
‘ in the church 's entire history , no one knew more but did less to protect kids than @entity1 , ’ said @entity148 , outreach director of the @entity52 - based victims ' advocacy group @entity149 , the @entity149			1
‘ as head of @entity49 , thousands of cases of predator priests crossed his desk			0
did he choose to warn families or call police about even one of those dangerous clerics ? no. that , by definition , is a cover - up			0
’ ' in the church 's entire history , no one knew more but did less to protect kids than @entity1 ' @entity148 , @entity149 after the 2010 explosion of abuse cases , the @entity28 issued informal guidelines ordering bishops to report suspected abusers to police in countries where it is required			1
but the @entity28 has yet to remove or sanction any bishop who covered up for an abuser			0
@entity1 became the first pope in 600 years to resign when he retired on february 28 , setting the stage for the election of @entity18 two weeks later			1
@entity1 said at the time that he would spend his final years ‘ hidden from the world , ’ living in a converted monastery tucked behind @entity182 , reading and praying			2
his decision to cloister himself was in part due to his own shy , bookish nature , but also to make clear that he was no longer pope and that his successor was in charge			0
@entity1 has been seen only a handful of times since his retirement and only once with @entity18 , at an official @entity28 ceremony in july			1
speaking : pope @entity1 delivers a message and blessing to faithful from the central loggia of @entity182 after the @entity197 at the @entity28 in april 2012 a prolific writer , he has published nothing since retiring except for the encyclical ‘ @entity200 , ’ which was signed by @entity18 but was actually written almost entirely by @entity1			1
pope @entity18 responded in the same pages to a series of questions posed to him by @entity17 's atheist editor in editorials this summer			1
pope @entity18 's letter was clearly not penned by his own hand : it involved language that is much closer to @entity1 's style , including arcane references to early church fathers like @entity213 whom only @entity1 and a few others at the @entity28 have ever cited			1
but @entity28 spokesman , the reverend @entity215 , denied the two had collaborated on it			0
‘ they are autonomous and distinct initiatives , ’ he said			0
' if you want to substitute @entity221 with nature , the question remains : what does this nature consist of ? ' emeritus pope @entity1 in @entity1 's letter , he takes mr @entity38 to task for what he said was the ‘ aggressiveness ’ of his book , and responds to many of the arguments with piqued criticism himself			1
‘ what you say about the figure of @entity233 is n't worthy of your scientific standing , ’ wrote @entity1 , who authored a highly praised , three - volume work on the @entity233 during his pontificate			2
he similarly criticizes mr @entity38 's ‘ religion of mathematics ’ as ‘ empty ’ since it does n't even consider three fundamental themes for humanity : freedom , love and evil			0
on evolution , he wrote : ‘ if you want to substitute @entity221 with @entity222 , the question remains : what does this nature consist of ? nowhere do you define it and it appears rather like an irrational divinity that does n't explain anything			0
’ mr @entity38 , for his part , wrote in an accompanying piece yesterday that he was stunned to have received the letter , though he said he wrote the book precisely in hopes @entity1 might read it			2
he said he sought , and obtained , @entity1 's permission to publish the letter			2
he planned to re-issue his book with @entity1 's letter included , calling the exchange ‘ an unprecedented dialogue between a theologian pope and an atheist mathematician , divided in most everything but drawn together by at least one objective : the search for @entity270			1
