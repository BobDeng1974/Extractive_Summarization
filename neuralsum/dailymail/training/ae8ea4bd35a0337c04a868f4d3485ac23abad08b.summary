by @entity0 published : 16:33 est , 19 august 2012 updated : 01:55 est , 20 august 2012 like most new mothers , @entity1 readily admits she is besotted with her baby son			1
but the 29 - year - old has more reason than most to feel blessed by @entity7 ’s safe arrival – because he is the child she was afraid it would be impossible for her to have			0
miss @entity1 and her partner @entity9 , 28 , were planning to get married and start a family when their world was turned upside down two years ago			1
blessed with child : @entity1 and partner @entity9 were relieved when baby @entity7 arrived safely after she was diagnosed with cervical cancer two years ago following a routine smear test , miss @entity1 was diagnosed with cervical cancer and warned she could die without a hysterectomy			1
but , distraught that she would never be able to have children of her own , she was offered the chance to undergo pioneering surgery to save both her life and her fertility			1
the operation , which has been performed on just a handful of @entity25 women , was a success			0
to her doctor ’s amazement , miss @entity1 became pregnant six months later and @entity7 was born by caesarean section weighing a healthy 7lb 11oz			1
miss @entity1 , a dental hygienist , said : ‘ @entity7 in my arms for the first time was the most amazing feeling ever , it was the best day of my life			1
it was very , very emotional			0
i was in tears , @entity9 was crying , even some of the doctors and nurses were blubbing , it was very special			2
' little miracle ' : miss @entity1 underwent pioneering surgery to save her life from cervical cancer and her fertility and to her doctor 's amazement miss @entity1 fell pregnant with @entity7 within six months ‘ to be told i had cancer and that i may never be a mother was heartbreaking , but then to be given this chance and to manage to get through the pregnancy and birth with a healthy little boy – we are just over the moon			1
‘ people say @entity7 is a happy little boy , but we are just so pleased to have him			0
we look at him every day and ca n’t quite believe he ’s here			0
he ’s our little miracle			0
’ radical surgery : miss @entity1 had a pioneering procedure devised at @entity57 , pictured , and the @entity58 miss @entity1 was diagnosed with cervical cancer in september 2010			1
doctors warned her that it was likely that she would need a hysterectomy to save her life			2
but , by chance , her consultant knew a doctor pioneering a little known procedure , known as a radical abdominal trachelectomy			2
the operation , devised by doctors at @entity57 and the @entity58 , both in @entity71 , involves most of the cervix – the muscle which holds a baby in the womb – being removed , together with the upper part of the vagina			0
the womb and the upper opening of the cervix , where it joins on to the womb , are left behind and rejoined to the vagina			0
a stitch is then inserted on to the upper opening of the cervix to hold a baby in place in the womb until it is ready to be delivered			0
‘ the doctors explained that i could have a hysterectomy or radiotherapy but i knew both would rob me of my fertility , ’ miss @entity1 , who lives with mr @entity9 , an it research analyst , in @entity89 , @entity90 , said			1
‘ this new operation seemed like a much better option			0
the consultant told me only a handful of women in the @entity25 had had the surgery but it had a good success rate			2
’ if the doctors had discovered during the operation that the cancer had spread they might still have had to perform a hysterectomy			0
but fortunately , that did n’t happen			0
delayed wedding plans : the couple put their wedding on hold and began trying for a baby six months after the successful operation miss @entity1 and mr @entity9 put their wedding plans on hold and began trying for a baby six months after the successful operation at @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity90 , in november 2010			1
she became pregnant almost immediately , in may last year , and after a normal pregnancy , @entity7 was born by a planned c - section at 38 weeks in february			2
‘ when i was diagnosed with cancer i ’d thought i ’d lost my chance to have children , but having @entity7 was made possible thanks to this amazing surgery , ’ added miss @entity1 , who is in remission from her cancer			1
‘ i just want other women to know that having a hysterectomy is not the only option if you have cancer , i ’m proof that fertility can be preserved and miracles do happen			2
