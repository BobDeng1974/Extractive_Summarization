but as this comical picture shows , this bear appeared to be doing just that as she held a bamboo stick up to her face as if she was playing the flute			1
crowds gathered around the panda enclosure at @entity15 in @entity16 , in the eastern @entity18 province of @entity19 , as one of the female bears put on the adorable show			1
the black and white giant panda then started gnawing on the bamboo branch - a staple in the bears ' diet			1
giant pandas , which are native to central @entity18 but are often kept in captivity to encourage the endangered species to breed , eat between one and five stone of bamboo branches , stems and shoots every day			2
female giant pandas can reach up to 19 stone , but those in the wild often weigh less as deforestation has led to bamboo being harder to find			0
there are thought to be slightly less than 2,000 pandas left in the wild , a number which has gradually increased since the 1960s after international efforts to save the species were increased			0
as well as this , there are about 240 giant pandas in captivity in @entity18 , while 49 live in zoos around the world , including two at @entity73			0
