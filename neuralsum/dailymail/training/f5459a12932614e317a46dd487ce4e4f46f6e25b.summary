the elusive spring weather will once again be eclipsed by low temperatures , although forecasters predict that the sun will make an appearance			1
after what is thought to be the coldest march in decades , the @entity11 weekend will also be accompanied by temperatures up to four degrees lower than the seasonal average			1
and despite the promise of widespread @entity30 sunshine , temperatures will only climb to between @entity41 , significantly below the @entity42 normally expected at this time of year			2
meanwhile , spectators hoping to watch the @entity44 between @entity45 and @entity46 might be wise to bring their wellies after the @entity25 burst its banks			1

flooding is also possible in the south east of the city near @entity91 , according to an @entity83 amber warning			1
the high water levels are caused by spring tides , which are especially strong tides occurring when the moon is full or new and aligned with the @entity96 and the sun. spring tides are not affected by the season of @entity100 but by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun combined			2
no floods caused by rain are expected over @entity30 , with the @entity106 predicting the weather to be mostly dry			1
the wheels of parked cars along the riverside were submerged in water after the @entity25 burst its banks in south west @entity67 water levels were much higher than usual in @entity29 and the path along the riverside became impassable on foot temperatures dropped to @entity118 in the @entity120 highlands last night and the weather will continue to be colder than normal for spring			1
forecaster @entity122 said : ' there has been sleet and snow showers in eastern areas like @entity127 and down towards the south today but the snow has been scattered and light			2
' these showers have been coming in from the east and may just about reach the east of @entity134			2
' for @entity30 it 's looking dry across most of the @entity5 with long sunny spells			1
temperatures over the bank holiday could drop to -2c and could fall further to -10c in the north of @entity120 overnight			1
' tomorrow we could see wintry showers in the afternoon in areas such as @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 but any snow will be more like sleet , and should n't stick or cause any travel problems			2
' for the @entity150 there will be a dry cold start to the day , with isolated wintry showers in the afternoon			2
most of the @entity5 will avoid snowy conditions over @entity30 but @entity155 , @entity156 in the @entity157 will remain covered hill walkers enjoyed snowy conditions in the @entity157 today while elsewhere in the @entity5 sunny spells are expected over the @entity30 weekend in @entity46 tourists got in the boating spirit and braved the snowy weather on the @entity164 snow flurries did not deter these tourists from enjoying themselves on the @entity164 in @entity46 a pub garden in south west @entity67 was left underwater ahead of sunday 's @entity150 the river burst its banks and cars parked in the streets adjacent had their wheels submerged in water ' we can expect lighter winds through tomorrow			1

' the floods along the @entity25 are likely to affect those hoping to watch the @entity44 if the high water levels continue			1
tomorrow 's clash between the @entity45 and @entity46 rowing teams will see the two elite universities go head to head in the 159th @entity150			0
as @entity45 and @entity46 rowing teams prepared for sunday 's race the @entity46 team 's car became submerged on the river bank the cars of the @entity46 team were left under water as they trained for the @entity44 on the @entity25 the @entity46 crew parked up on the river bank but their cars were left soggy when the @entity25 reached high tide every year crowds line the four - and - a - quarter mile course from @entity29 to @entity202 to support the two teams in a race which tends to last just over 15 minutes			1
earlier this week the @entity46 team were caught out by the @entity25 tides after their vehicles parked up nearby were submerged in water from the flooding river			1
both teams have had to take care to avoid large pieces of debris coming down the river in high tides as they prepared for sunday 's contest			2
@entity150 spokesperson @entity216 said : ' as the race is just over four miles long that gives the crowds eight miles of riverside to watch from			0
' so while there are areas that may flood , other parts of the stretch will be fine to watch from			0
' as high tide is just after 6pm and the race starts at 4.30pm so the race does n't take place when the tide is at its highest			2
' last year 's @entity31 was interrupted when 36 - year - old anti-elitist protester @entity229 swam in front of the rowers			1
he was handed a six - month prison sentence			0
the @entity45 crew departed from the slipway as they went out on a training outing on the @entity25 today @entity239 of @entity45 throws his wellies to the shore as they prepare for the 159th @entity150 since the @entity150 began in 1829 , the @entity45 rowing team have won 76 races to @entity46 ¿ s 81 the two teams will go head to head on @entity30 in the @entity31 from @entity29 to @entity202 last year 's race was interrupted when anti-elitist protester 36 - year - old @entity248 swam in front of the rowers it might not just be the rowers getting their feet wet at tomorrow 's race if the tides are as high as they were yesterday @entity255 will be drafted in to patrol the @entity31 tomorrow as security is beefed up to ensure the event is not disrupted by another protester			1
last year 's race had to be halted when @entity229 swam into the path of the @entity45 and @entity46 university crews , narrowly avoiding being struck by an oar			0
organisers have warned against a repeat of anyone taking to the water for the 159th race , with the @entity255 set to patrol eight miles of the @entity25 in inflatable boats			1
@entity31 executive director @entity268 said : ‘ we are taking additional measures this year and have reviewed all of our actions last year in detail			1
‘ @entity150 course is four and a quarter miles long so we have eight and a half miles of riverbank to manage and monitor			0
‘ what i would say to anybody thinking of disrupting the race is that it 's unbelievably dangerous			0
you risk injuring yourself , the crews and the other people following the race			0
‘ nobody wants that to happen			0
this is just a sporting event			0
’ @entity229 , 36 , was released from prison in december having served seven weeks of a six - month sentence after being found guilty of causing a public nuisance			0
he has since been contacted by the @entity292 by letter and on @entity294 to establish whether he was planning any action this year , saying they were ‘ keen to facilitate any peaceful protest ’			0
in a statement , the police stressed they were not offering to organise a protest but to afford him the opportunity to exercise his ‘ lawful rights without causing disruption or danger to themselves or others ’			0
however , @entity248 told the spectator he would ‘ probably have a ramble across the @entity310 instead ’			0
@entity45 have emerged as clear favourites to win the race after more than 70 per cent of bets were placed on the @entity314 , according to bookmaker @entity315			0
spokesman @entity317 said : ‘ @entity45 are certainly the best backed crew as of yet , although that was very much the case at this stage of proceedings last year			0
‘ last year , however , we took nearly £ 40,000 on the day of the race and @entity46 became best backed by the time the race started			0
maybe history will repeat itself this time around			0
’ there have been calls for supporters to boycott the @entity46 team over claims that it plans to build a new boat house which will threaten wildlife			0
@entity334 , the former head of conservation at the @entity337 and @entity46 student , told the @entity338 that the building project is in danger of wiping out otters and bitterns on the @entity344 river			2
‘ i hope that the @entity46 boat sinks in sunday 's @entity150 , ’ he said			0
‘ why ? because the @entity346 is planning to build a new boathouse ( although it is far more than just a boathouse ) on one of the best sites for otters in @entity351 , and its impact on local wildlife will be severe			0
’ but @entity355 , the group working to provide the new facility , have stressed the boat house would be built sensitively to protect its natural surroundings , the paper reported .			0
