in the 1950s , biologists claimed large , long necked dinosaurs were so heavy and with such short legs that the only way they could support the weight was by wallowing in water			0

@entity50 researchers discovered 100million - year - old markings on the floor of an old river bed known as @entity54 because of the number of fossilised finds there			1
but unlike the footprints previously found , these were scratchmarks from a two - legged , land dwelling beast rather than a water - dwelling species of the time			1
the size of the clawmarks suggests it may well have been a tyrannosaur or other , similar sized carnivore , said the @entity68 fossil hunters			1
and the way they were scratched on to the surface show it was not running , as it would on land , but propelling itself as if in water - a kind of ' dino paddle ' action			1
@entity80 researcher @entity78 , who made the find in @entity83 's @entity82 , said the markings show a co-ordinated ' left - right , left - right ' movement of the feet			1
the area is known as @entity54 because it has provided evidence of so many different species of the beasts moving through the area			1
@entity78 told the journal @entity93 : ' what we have are scratches left by the tips of a two - legged dinosaur 's feet			2
' the dinosaur 's claw marks show it was swimming along in this river and just its tippy toes were touching bottom			2
' it is estimated the creature paddled at least 15 metres but the scratches are not enough to positively identify exactly which species it was			0
however , the overall size would suggest it was a large predator such as a @entity2 or a @entity113 , both of which were common to the area of @entity83			0

opinion has see - sawed backwards and forwards since then depending on the interpretation of each subsequent major discovery .			2
