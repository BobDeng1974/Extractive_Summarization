by @entity0 published : 22:56 est , 6 october 2013 updated : 23:49 est , 6 october 2013 @entity1 , who prefers to be called @entity2 , is 67 years old with the build of a linebacker and a fondness for beer , barbecue and rodeo - as well as ruffled skirts and anything with a bow			1
for years , @entity1 struggled with his compulsion to wear women 's clothing , and living in @entity16 , the @entity16 , with its attendant bigotry and intolerance , did n't help			1
whenever @entity1 tried to quash his urge to wear women 's clothing - to deny what makes him him - he has suffered breakdowns , depression and suicidal thoughts			1
free spirit : the 67 - year - old college science instructor @entity28 just prefers to do most things in a skirt many years ago , with the help of his wife @entity32 and doctors , @entity1 came to understand his cross-dressing - and to accept himself			1
but the same ca n't be said for @entity16 's conservative population			1
when @entity1 began wearing skirts and blouses in public , he faced hostility at every turn , being kicked out of hotels , stores and restaurants and enduring public ridicule			1
despite its self - bestowed moniker , ' @entity16 , ' @entity1 says equality exists only for the majority			1
over the years , @entity1 has been beaten and insulted in public , but he says the worst pain has been from people he knows snubbing him in public , and knowing the embarrassment and shame his family has had to endure because of him			1
' the physical wounds from a beating eventually heal , ' he told the @entity57			2
' but the pain of being shunned by people you know lasts a lifetime			2
it 's worse than getting kicked in the kidney			1
' being who he is : @entity28 has spent 30 years fighting intolerance ' i ’ve been arrested in @entity68 and @entity69 for wearing a dress			1
i ’ve been physically assaulted twice			2
once in my own front yard i was kicked in the head			2
several of my teeth were kicked in and bones were broken in my mouth , ' he told the now - defunct @entity78			1
' the other time was at the @entity80			2
this man just walked up and blind - sided me , just sucker - punched me			1
he split my ear wide open , and i was bleeding down the side of my head			0
' more recently , he says , his own neighbor taunted him for his choice of clothing			0
' i baited him - i admit it , ' @entity1 told the @entity57 , explaining that he asked the man whether he was a coward as well as a bigot			1
i might have done the same thing			0
' family man : @entity1 is happily married to his wife of 45 years and the couple have two children @entity1 grew up in the town of @entity97 , @entity16 with an alcoholic mother and an abusive stepfather			1
he told the @entity57 that dressing up in girls clothing as a boy gave him ' a safety valve ; an escape from a hostile environment			0
' the compulsion continued into adulthood even as @entity1 became a real @entity16 man 's man , competing in rodeos - albeit wearing ladies underpants beneath his chaps - and becoming an @entity113 crew chief in the @entity114			1
his secret was discovered while he was on duty in @entity117 when an officer caught sleeping in a pink nightgown			0
he was given an honorable discharge for the offense			0
accomplished : when @entity1 gained the confidence to be himself , he was able to build aircraft , gain a mathematics degree and become a teacher cross-dressing is still taboo , even in the country 's most liberal cities , but in @entity16 , the country 's least populated state , it 's particularly loathsome and misunderstood			1
@entity16 is the state in which college student @entity132 was tortured and killed in 1998 for being gay			1
despite this , or perhaps because of it , @entity28 has spent 30 years being exactly who he is			1
his compulsion is n't linked in any way to his sexuality - @entity1 has been married to his wife @entity32 for 45 years and the couple have two grown - up children			1
rather , he told the @entity57 , it 's something he calls gender independence : he just prefers to do most things in a dress			2
when he was younger , @entity1 did n't know what to call his urge to cross-dress , having never heard the term ' transvestite ' , so he called himself a @entity155 - gender enhanced male			2
' i do n't dress any differently in @entity157 or in @entity158 than i do at home , ' @entity1 says			0
' just because i go somewhere does n’t change who i am			0
' dressed up : cross-dressing remains a taboo even in the most liberal @entity164 states @entity1 prefers to be called @entity2			2
he took on the name when a woman called him a sissy , appropriating the slur and possessing it			0
' first i was offended , ' he told the @entity57			0
' then i saw it : " that 's who and what i am			2
i wear women 's clothes			2
" ' @entity28 faced another battle 30 years ago when his place of work tried to have him conform to a male style of dress or face termination of his employment			1
' i complied for about three months and then i had a nervous breakdown			0
i saw a therapist and found out through counseling that i am the way i am and that that ’s okay , ' he told @entity78			0
friends and supporters : @entity1 says he 's slowly noticed more acceptance among friends and strangers in conservative @entity16 ' about that time the union stepped in and said , “ this is a good employee , he ’s skilled and experienced			1
” we went into binding arbitration with the company and when we were done i was allowed to keep my job and my dress			0
' now , @entity1 turns up to his job as an instructor at @entity203 's power technology lab. he tells his mostly male students to call him @entity2 and carries his lunch in a pink cooler bag			2
he told the @entity57 that he has asked his classes to keep an open mind and not judge him on the way he dresses			0
once , his class arrived in hoodies and removed them in unison to reveal pink ribbons in their hair and matching pink shirts to show solidarity to @entity28			0
in another encouraging gesture , a stranger recently apologized for driving past him and yelling a slur			0
despite the slow moves forward , @entity1 has no intention of leaving his home - state of @entity16			1
once , in 1979 , after a particularly terrifying experience when he was arrested in a department store for cross dressing , he put his house up for sale			0
but @entity1 changed his mind : ' when someone does n't meet their expectations of what a man should be like , they run him out of town , ' he said to the @entity57			2
' i was n't going to go			0
' despite the moniker , it 's surely no small act of bravery just for @entity28 to leave his home every morning dressed in women 's clothing			1
leave the house he does , a man in the @entity16 dressed as a woman and fighting to be allowed to be who he is			1
at the state fair this year he felt someone kick him in the behind , and wheeled around to find five cowboys staring him down			0
never one to back down from a fight , he pointed to his blouse : ' see that buddy ? do n't let it fool you and do n't let it happen again			0
' @entity28 's advice to anyone facing intolerance ? ' we are normal , i ’d like to tell them			2
grasp on to all that you are			0
we are all individuals , and it ’s okay to be different			0
@entity272 in your family and friends			0
do n’t hold your head in shame			0
@entity278 should be respected just like any other human being			0

@entity281 has been cross-dressing in @entity16 for 30 years
he 's endured *violence* and ridicule but defends his right to be himself
the married father of two says small - town *ignorance* in @entity16 has made his life *difficult* but he refuses to let bigotry drive him away
