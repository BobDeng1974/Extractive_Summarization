that 's me and ' @entity2			2
' @entity3 and @entity4 her trademark hair is thick , glossy and silky smooth			1
her sapphire blue eyes are piercing and stare icily ahead making little effort to disguise the contempt she feels for all before her			2
the lady in question is @entity4 , the moody @entity13 sensation taking the modelling world by storm and who , last year , clawed in over £ 2 million in fees , outstripping the earnings of bushy - eyebrowed supermodel - of - the - moment @entity19			1
designer @entity3 says : ‘ she is the centre of the world , when you see her you understand			1
she is kind of @entity25			1
it ’s the way she moves , the way she plays			2
there ’s something unforgettable about her			0
she is an inspiration for elegance			0
’ but this starlet who has bewitched the creative director of fashion house @entity35 is no leggy clothes horse , in fact her legs — all four of them — are on the short side			0
for @entity4 is a three - year - old @entity42 cat and the pride , joy , and slightly disturbing obsession , of @entity3 — or ‘ @entity2 ’ as he calls himself when talking to his pet			1
@entity4 is so famous she has notched up over 100,000 followers on @entity48 and @entity49 , boasts a @entity51 entry and does n’t get out of her bed for less than a million quid			1
her earnings came from just two jobs , one for @entity58 cosmetics company @entity56 to whom she lent her name for a special capsule collection			2
the other was posing for @entity64 car brand @entity63			0
in keeping with her first - class pedigree , @entity4 would never promote cheap brands			1
‘ i do n’t allow it , she ’s far too sophisticated for that , ’ sneers the pony - tailed @entity3 , who admits to being in love with his feline muse			1
‘ there is no marriage allowed between humans and animals , ’ he said regretfully in an interview recently			0
‘ i never thought i would fall in love with a cat			0
’ @entity4 and the @entity35 chief are rarely apart , living , eating and sleeping together with their respective entourages trailing in their wake			1
yes , @entity4 has her own six - strong team at her beck and call whether they ’re catering for her very faddy diet , stocking up on her favourite beauty products or just tickling her furry tummy			1
while most moggies start their day with a tin of supermarket pet food , @entity4 ’s tastes are a little more refined			1
she ’s not so much the cat who got the cream as the cat who got the bespoke mineral water , specially blended for her using a cocktail of @entity98 , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity64 water by @entity102 in @entity103			0
let me eat cake - as that other famous @entity13 glamour puss , @entity107 , almost said i travel in style and i refuse to go anywhere unless it 's in this £ 1,660 @entity113 pet carrier she does n’t demean herself by eating her food from the floor but dines perched on the table beside her @entity2			1
when it comes to her diet she laughs in the face of @entity121 and @entity122			0
all her food is prepared by her personal chef @entity124 who creates several dishes at a time including liver pate , chicken and asparagus and fresh fish			0
all morsels are served in her favourite silver dishes made for her by @entity13 luxury goods company @entity132			1
when not dining at home @entity4 likes to eat in some of the finest eateries			1
restaurants in @entity103 are n’t exactly known for welcoming humans with open arms , let alone animals , but when you ’re a superstar like @entity4 , escorted by the head of @entity13 ’s most iconic fashion house , then no maitre d ’ is going to tell you to ‘ casse toi ’ ( get lost )			1
flicking through the apps on my @entity145 keeps me entertained on my private jet , before a little catnap on the pilot 's lap the famous @entity151 on the banks of the @entity153 will prepare a special ‘ @entity159 ’ dish for their fussy feline diner , a concotion of chopped boiled eggs infused with fresh mint			0
over at @entity160 they offer croquettes a @entity163 ( potato croquettes with minced beef )			0
the one thing her personal vet @entity166 has put her foot down about , however , is her penchant for beluga caviar			0
no , it ’s not the extortionate price ( as if ) , rather the fact it ’s far too high in salt and fat			0
besides , a girl needs to watch her weight and @entity4 likes to stay at a trim 7lb 11oz			1
perhaps the extraordinary thing about @entity4 is that , strictly speaking , she was stolen — catnapped — by @entity3 who was only meant to look after her for her a fortnight as a favour to her original owner , @entity13 model @entity181			1
when @entity181 returned from his skiing trip he was told that @entity3 had taken such a shine to his kitty that he would n’t be handing her back			2
given that @entity181 was the male face of @entity35 , he was hardly going to argue with the boss			0
i told my @entity48 followers : ' the @entity13 do n't need to bathe so much , that 's what perfume is for , oui ? @entity3 perfume , naturally this is me promoting @entity63 cars			1
it was exhausting work but i must say the money was rather good since then @entity4 has published an autobiography — a glossy 128 - page coffee table affair called the private life of a @entity201 in which her two personal maids @entity203 and @entity204 ( one for day , one for night , darling ) regale us with details of her fabulous life			2
it was in the book that we learned @entity4 ( who @entity3 claims : ‘ is like a woman spoiled to death ’ ) travels everywhere by private jet			1
she likes to curl up in the lap of the pilot for the duration of the flight or ( i kid you not ) entertain herself flicking through pages on her personal @entity145			0
@entity4 likes to summer in @entity222 and splits the rest of the time between @entity103 , @entity224 and @entity225			2
she ’s backstage when her @entity2 exhibits his new collections but snubs the after - show bashes			0
‘ she ’s not a party animal , ’ says @entity3			2
‘ she likes her sleep			0
’ and , just like @entity2 , @entity4 hates to be around children			2
it ’s the job of maids to pack her custom - made @entity113 trunks for her trips away and be sure to include her array of beauty and grooming products , including eye drops and brushes and oils for her fur which is combed every day — no fur balls			0
with so much effort put into her looks , it ’s no wonder @entity4 has already graced the cover of @entity248 on two occasions			2
in december 2014 she featured on the front of @entity251 @entity248 in the arms of model @entity253 and , back in july 2013 , she snuggled up to @entity255 on the cover of @entity64 @entity248			0
this is the bed i share with my fashion designer ' @entity2			0
' we both love antique @entity13 lace the fashion designer said of @entity4 , ' it ’s all in the eyes , the eyes , the eyes			1
it ’s how she communicates ’ it must be said that @entity4 has only one look but , according to @entity3 , that does n’t matter : ‘ it ’s all in the eyes , the eyes , the eyes			1
it ’s how she communicates			0
’ @entity3 has already designed a range of accessories ( @entity277 ) in his pet ’s honour			1
items in the collection include socks for £ 25 , a keyring for £ 90 and £ 300 shopping bags , all adorned with a white cat motif			2
he ’s not saying what ’s next in the pipleine for his ‘ moody little princess ’ , but one thing ’s for sure , when it comes to glamour pusses they do n’t come any bigger — or richer — than this one .			0

@entity4 earned £ *2million* in fees and has over 100,000 @entity48 followers
@entity13 cats earnings outstripped those of supermodel @entity19
@entity3 compared his pet to @entity303 legend ' @entity25 '
