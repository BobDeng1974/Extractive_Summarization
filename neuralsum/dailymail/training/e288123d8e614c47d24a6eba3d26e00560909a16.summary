a patient believed to have been in a vegetative state for more than a decade has been able to communicate using the power of thought			2
@entity5 , who was left severely brain damaged after a car crash , has managed to tell his doctors he is not in any pain			1
he is one of several such patients being treated using a pioneering technique developed by researchers at @entity13			0
it also means he can communicate in a way that could help doctors improve his quality of life			1
professor @entity30 uses functional magnetic resonance imaging ( @entity32 ) scans to detect changes in the flow of the blood around the brain			1
@entity5 , from @entity37 , @entity38 , and @entity40 patient @entity39 both feature in a @entity43 programme on the groundbreaking approach to brain - injured patients tonight			1
a team led by professor @entity30 ( pointing at screen ) study brain scans from @entity5 mr @entity5 has been able to confirm his father 's name and that he has a niece first , patients are asked to imagine they are playing tennis			1
this prompts an increase in blood - flow to an area at the front of the brain called the premotor cortex , which can be detected by the scan			1
patients are then told to picture themselves walking around different rooms in their house			1
this activates an entirely separate area of the brain , the parahippocampal gyrus , situated in the middle			0
a functional @entity72 ( @entity32 ) machine measure real - time activity of the brain by tracking the flow of oxygen rich blood in the brain			2
patients are asked repeatedly to imagine playing tennis or walking around their home			1
in healthy volunteers imagining the scenarios produces distinct patterns of activity in the brain			2
scientists have matched these to a minority of severely injured patients			0
once these patterns have been established , patients can answer yes or no by imagining either walking around the home or playing tennis			1
they are then asked a question and told to imagine they are playing tennis if the answer is no and if yes , to pretend they are walking round the house			1
from the subsequent changes in blood flow , doctors can work out their answers			2
the technique has been successfully used on a number of vegetative patients at @entity106 in @entity107 and by @entity108 at the @entity109 in @entity110 , @entity38			0
prof @entity30 said : ' asking a patient something important to them has been our aim for many years			0
in future we could ask that we could do to improve their quality of life			0
' @entity5 is the first to have been able to answer whether he was in pain			2
on two occasions in the last six months he has told doctors ‘ no ’ by imagining he was playing tennis			1
until then patients had responded to basic questions such as ‘ is your father ’s name @entity127 ? ’ or ‘ do you have a niece ? ’ doctors hope that over the coming weeks @entity5 will be able to answer questions such as what time he prefers to be bathed or given his dinner			1
his family also want to know whether he likes listening to ice hockey on the radio			0
‘ @entity5 has been able to show he has a conscious , thinking mind , ’ professor @entity30 said			1
‘ we have scanned him several times and his pattern of brain activity shows he is clearly choosing to answer our questions			0
we believe he knows who and where he is			0
’ @entity5 's parents said they always thought he was conscious and could communicate by lifting a thumb or moving his eyes , but this was never accepted by medical staff			1
professor @entity148 of @entity149 in @entity110 , @entity37 , who has been @entity5 ’s neurologist for a decade , said : ‘ he had the clinical picture of a typical vegetative patient – no emotional response , no fixation or following with his eyes			2
he did n’t have any spontaneous movements that looked meaningful and i was quite impressed and amazed that he was able to show these cognitive responses with @entity32			0
’ the medical team use brain scanning to detect hidden awareness in patients and to enable them to communicate the @entity38 was asked to imagine playing tennis if he wanted to answer no to various questions while he was in an mri scanner not all vegetative patients can respond using this technique as it requires so much concentration			1
professor @entity30 says that about one in five who have scans can answer questions			0
@entity172 , 20 , suffered severe brain injuries last year when he jumped off a moving bus			2
he had to have a large section of his skull removed due to internal bruising			0
@entity39 was too ill to have a full assessment at the @entity179 in @entity180 , which collaborates with the team at @entity13			0
however , despite appearing vegetative his brain scans show he is minimally conscious			2
he has some periods of awareness and may be able to recognise the faces of his family and friends			0
the mind reader : unlocking @entity189			0
a @entity190 , 10:35pm , @entity43 tonight .			0

@entity5 was left severely brain damaged in a car crash 10 years *ago*
his parents were *convinced* he was conscious and trying to respond by moving his thumb , but medical staff did *n't* believe them
he has now managed to communicate with doctors by imagining playing tennis for ' no ' and walking in his house for ' yes '
blood flows to different parts of the brain depending on what he imagines
