by @entity0 published : 20:58 est , 8 december 2012 updated : 21:14 est , 8 december 2012 in a large part of this country , it is against the law to fly the @entity5 from government buildings for 348 days of the year			1
this has been so since the year 2000			1
as a special treat , it can be flown for the other 17 days			1
the rest of the time the flagpole stays bare			1
the place where this law operates is @entity14			1
i wonder how much longer we shall be able to fly our national flag in the rest of the @entity19 , or even how much longer that flag will exist at all			1
i think this is a shocking fact			1
i am one of the few @entity19 journalists who bothered to read the so - called ‘ @entity29 ’ agreement under which this country capitulated to the gangsters of the @entity26 , under @entity28 pressure			1
' no surrender ' : protestors wave @entity32 in front of @entity35 's @entity34 earlier this week after the @entity5 flag was removed from the building i know that we released hundreds of grisly criminals , destroyed our security apparatus and withdrew the @entity41 in return for various unsigned and unenforceable promises from @entity44 and the @entity26			1
but even i did not know that this was one of its effects			1
our national flag , you see , might offend someone			1
that is also the excuse for its recent removal from @entity54 , which has led to so much bitterness and turmoil in that city			1
but the reality is this			1
you haul down your flag when you surrender			1
and it was a surrender			1
i was amused to see that mrs @entity62 , that nasty hard leftist now aiming for the @entity64 , had her vote - winning visit to @entity14 spoiled by the flag riots on friday			1
how can you have riots and peace ? the great pretence , that giving in to organised crime brings peace , was for once exposed			2
@entity14 ’s poor and weak have never been so subject to intimidation and gangsterism , and i wonder if i will live to see the ( sadly inevitable ) day when @entity74 troops are putting down @entity76 riots on the @entity77 , probably caused by illegal displays of the old @entity5			1
the squalid history of this event is a warning we refuse to heed and which is barely known @entity83 saw it happen , in @entity85 , astonished by the brusque and scornful treatment of my country by a nation i had foolishly seen as an ally			2
i remember one very senior @entity64 official letting slip to me that she thought of @entity19 as a sort of @entity93 , just another place to intervene in , as @entity95 is now			2
i have laughed at the phrase ‘ special relationship ’ ever since			2
i followed @entity44 ’s @entity98 round the @entity28 , as this coffin - faced apologist for violence and terror was feted and adulated by @entity28 who would have shrunk from him had he spoken for any other cause but the @entity74 one			2
i annoyed him so much with my inconvenient questions that he publicly said i should be ‘ decommissioned ’ and – on the one occasion we were ever alone together – showed me his less diplomatic , less humorous side			2
what was this about ? mrs @entity62 ’s husband @entity111 needed working - class @entity114 votes to win the @entity64 , votes his party had lost by backing abortion			2
so he discovered the @entity74 cause , about which he knew little and ( i suspect ) cared less			2
he also took a lot of @entity74 - @entity28 campaign money			2
in 1993 , @entity120 , which these days means some very big business , tired of waiting for results and demanded action			1
and so he acted , and so we were forced to make a shameful peace with the @entity26 , and haul down our flag over part of our own territory			0
by the time the whole thing ’s finished , @entity129 will have to come out of that flag , and the harp will depart from the @entity133			0
i think that when countries suffer defeats , they should admit to them and grieve over them , not pretend they have won			0
that way lie more defeats and more humiliations			0
i am glad @entity143 has pulled out of the latest propaganda campaign against anti-drug laws , a documentary by sir @entity148 ’s son , @entity147 , called breaking the @entity149			0
breaking the taboo : @entity143 briefly featured in a @entity151 promoting a new documentary on drugs far too many celebrities and politicians have been beguiled by the case for surrender			0
sir @entity148 himself ( who was barely coherent in a drugs debate i had with him on @entity160 last thursday ) is one of them			0
whose interests do they serve ? i can only assume that they simply do n’t understand what they are doing , or the dangers they are playing with			0
a request to any prominent person asked to back this campaign : arrange a visit to the locked wards of @entity19 ’s mental hospitals , and ask the relatives of their occupants what they think caused the problem			0
why are we such cringing serfs about tax ? our money belongs to us			0
it is n’t pocket money from the state , but our own			0
if they want it , they should prove they know what to do with it			0
what evidence is there that the government , that incompetent waster , would spend money better than @entity198 ? who do you think would pay in the end , if @entity198 paid more tax – why , the customers			0
even @entity205 politicians are careful not to pay too much tax when ( for instance ) they inherit property			0
@entity211 @entity210 journalists are fond of ( legal ) arrangements to keep their tax low			0
why should coffee shops be expected to behave differently ? it is strange how muted is the tv coverage of the descent of @entity218 into @entity220 despotism , and the brutal behaviour of the new regime to protesters			0
compare this with the euphoric , uncritical coverage of the original @entity226 ’			0
as this doomed , overrated event repeatedly proves the pessimists right , can we learn nothing ? no. the world ’s media are still promoting an intervention in @entity95 , where we will replace bad with worse , at a cost of many lives			0
last weekend , almost every @entity238 bulletin i listened to , over several days , mentioned a petition calling for full implementation of the @entity242 into the press , and said that the number of signatures was rising			1
unless they can show that they have ever done this with any other comparable petition , i believe this is objective evidence of @entity210 bias on a matter of public controversy			0
will the @entity254 act ? sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0

under the ' good friday ' agreement , flying the @entity5 is illegal in @entity14 on 348 days of the year
