they raised concerns about a ' quiet room ' where residents spent time or slept overnight , while being monitored by a surveillance camera , describing it as ' unsuitable '			1
the report states how care workers told inspectors residents were ' verbally prompted or physically assisted ' into the room			1
inspectors discovered the unheated room contained nothing more than an armchair , an air mattress and a security camera			1
the report states : ' the window was locked , so there was no ventilation in the room if the door was closed , and there was no curtain or other window covering to promote privacy ( the room is on the ground floor and can easily be looked into )			2
' it goes on to say : ' we were told by the manager that the " quiet room " was used as a place for people to relax but it had no features of a relaxing , calming nature , as it lacked any form of stimuli and was stark and cold			1

' the allegations we have heard make us believe this could be one of the worst incidents of abuse towards vulnerable adults in residential care and , moreover , that the abuse at @entity76 , which was shockingly exposed by @entity112 , was not just an isolated occurrence but a symptom of a more systematic problem in the care sector			0
solicitors representing residents at @entity16 and @entity119 ( pictured ) have said the allegations suggest a ' systematic problem in the care sector ' ' we would encourage anyone with further information on the homes to come forward and speak to the police to assist the ongoing investigation			2
' at the time of the @entity26 inspections , @entity128 , deputy director of @entity26 in the @entity129 , said the care methods were ' old fashioned ' and ' stuck in the past '			0
