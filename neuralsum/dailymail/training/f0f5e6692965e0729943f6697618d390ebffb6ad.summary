a man who broke with tradition and decided to take his wife 's last name when they married is fighting to get his driving license back after it was suspended when he was accused of fraud			1
@entity7 , from @entity8 , offered to change his name following his 2011 marriage to wife @entity11 in order to fulfill her wish to continue her @entity15 family surname			1
shortly after their marriage , mr @entity16 ordered a new passport and social security card and changed his bank account and credit cards before applying to update his drivers license			1
@entity7 broke with tradition when he offered to change his name following his 2011 marriage to wife @entity11 in order to fulfill her wish to continue her @entity15 family surname ' it was an act of love			1
i have no particular emotional ties to my last name , ' said mr @entity16 , 40 , who was born in @entity34 and moved to the @entity35 at the age of 11 in 1984			0
just as is the case for newlywed women mr @entity16 was initially issued a new license after presenting his marriage certificate and paying a $ 20 fee			2
when the government issues you a new passport you figure you 're fine , ' he said			0
mr @entity16 ordered a new passport and social security card and changed his bank account and credit cards before applying to update his drivers license			1
a year later he was told he had obtained it ' by fraud ' but just over a year later , in december , @entity16 received a letter from @entity8 's @entity55 accusing him of ' obtaining a driving license by fraud ' and advising him that his license would be suspended at the end of the month			1
ironically , it was addressed to @entity16			0
he said he assumed it was a mistake but when he called the state dmv office in @entity62 he said he was told he had to go to court first in order to change his name legally , a process that takes several months and has a $ 400 filing fee			0
when he explained he was changing his name due to marriage , he was told ' that only works for women , ' he said			2
' apparently the state of @entity8 clings to the out - dated notion that treats women as an extension of a man , ' said @entity7 's lawyer , @entity76 , with @entity77 in @entity78			1
while it was unusual for a man to seek to be considered an extension on his wife , @entity16 's case raised important issues for gay marriage , he noted			1
' if @entity7 is n't allowed to change his name , what is going to happen when a gay couple seeks a name change ? ' only a few states have made their marriage name change policy gender neutral , @entity88 said			2
in @entity8 's case it has no law , although the @entity55 's website does not specify gender			0
according to @entity88 , 9 states enable a man to change his name upon marriage : @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107			0
the @entity8 @entity55 did not respond to a request for comment			0
he has been told he had to go to court first in order to change his name legally , a process that takes several months and has a $ 400 filing fee following a @entity55 hearing , @entity16 was issued a @entity116 on january 14 confirming that his license had been properly suspended for fraud			2
he is now appealing that order but has not dared get behind the wheel			0
' i do n't understand			0
i 'm being treated like a highway criminal , ' said @entity16 , who said he has a perfect driving record and now is struggling to carry out his job , begging his wife and friends for rides .			2

@entity7 took his wife @entity11 's last name after 2011 marriage
but despite *successfully* ordering a new passport and social security card he was told he had obtained his driving license ' by fraud '
he is now too *scared* to drive and is relying on friends and family for lifts
