pregnant women are often told they are at their most beautiful when they are expecting			2
and , of course , their bump is protecting very precious cargo			0
and now they can preserve the image of their bump for posterity as a pair of @entity11 bodycasters launch a company offering sculptures of baby bumps for women to keep forever			0
sculptor couple @entity15 and @entity17 , both 40 from @entity18 in @entity19 , use special effects make - up to help make the bumps , and their intricate designs range from blue and white florals painted like china , to stone sculptures studded with mirrors or a more traditional bronze			1
the couple worked in television and film before they started creating the baby - bump casts as a hobby for friends			1
' coming from such diverse creative backgrounds we work in so many different materials and we love being challenged to try new things			0
' so what you 'll see in our pictures is that every single belly cast we make is unique and utterly special to the owner of that piece			2
' we love really personal requests where people will have us engrave or paint a piece with personal symbols or patterns - perhaps inspired by something to do with their home or family heritage			2
before and after : the two bodycasters used to work in tv and used special effects make - up to create the casts they did the very first bump cast for one of their friends and then everyone wanted one , so the business snowballed from there the casting session takes up to 60 minutes but it 's only after 14 weeks for a stonecast piece to be fabricated and five months for bronze works to be completed ' we 'll go to the ends of the earth to search out new techniques or materials to work with to satisfy our clients			1
' we love what we do and we think that level of care shows in our work			0
' the casting session takes between 30 to 60 minutes to complete			1
however , it takes 14 weeks for a stonecast piece to be fabricated and five months for bronze works to be completed			0
@entity17 's partner , @entity104 explained how the pair turned these belly - casts into a business			1
bodycaster couple , @entity17 , left , and @entity15 , right , turned their hobby into a business ' @entity113 are a bit like @entity115 and people either love them or hate them , ' she said			1
' we did the very first bump cast together and then all my pregnant friends wanted one , and all their pregnant friends wanted one , and it snowballed from there			1
' this progressed into learning how to do all the different body parts			0
' i love hearing everyone 's stories , and then welcoming the clients back later to collect their bumps and sometimes cast the new babies			0
' clients often come back and back with new siblings and other family members , so it 's really wonderful seeing families grow and change over the years			0
' we love to make the casts as personal and individual as possible			2
some people even have us engrave poems or song lyrics into them			0
' nothing is too wacky or wild a request , and the only limits are budget and imagination			2
' clients often return to the couple 's studio with new siblings and other family members to get theirs done speaking about the casts , which are made from traditional plaster casts to more elaborate stone and even bronze , @entity17 said : ' we believe our belly casts are some of the most beautiful in existence in the world '			1

@entity160 @entity15 and @entity17 , 40 , from @entity19 , make the designs
started making them as a hobby for pregnant friends
casting session takes between 30 to 60 minutes to complete
say no request is too wacky or wild - only budget is a *constraint*
admit the belly casts divide *opinion* : ' they are like @entity115 , ' they say
