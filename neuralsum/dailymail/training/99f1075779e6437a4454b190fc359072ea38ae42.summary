by @entity0 for @entity1 thieves have made an audacious attempt to steal a @entity5 artwork valued at £ 1million by removing the bricks it was painted on from the inside of the building			1
the ' @entity10 ' , which features three 1950s - style spies eavesdropping on a phone - box , appeared on the outer wall of an end - of - terrace house in @entity15 , @entity16 , in april			1
after several pieces of the wall were recently removed from the building without any sign of forced entry - the current owner of @entity18 , @entity19 , is calling the attempted theft an inside job			1
he said : ' it was a real surprise			2
when we realised the damage had been done we arranged to go in with the owner			2
' there was a lot of damage			0
brick work has been taken out all over the place			0
there is nothing wrong with the overall structure though			0
' the council are involved to see if a crime has been committed because it 's a @entity58 listed building			1
' i have written to the council for their view and someone from health and safety has also got in			0
structurally , they do n't see it as a big issue			0
' the image above shows how ' @entity10 ' first looked when it appeared on this wall in @entity15 in april despite the extensive damage to the inside of the building - there was no sign of forced entry suggesting that whoever did the damage had a key when the artwork first appeared on the £ 300,000 terraced house a bidding war ensued - with the council boarding up the wall to prevent vandalism			1
after mr @entity19 agreed on a price for the house , the boarding was taken down so that people could enjoy the art - but the image was soon vandalised and drilled into			1
the new internal damage is somewhat of a mystery though as no - one is currently living in the property			1
mr @entity19 added : ' it 's difficult to say how they got in			1
there was no burglary , let 's put it like that			0
someone had a key i 'm guessing			1
there was no broken windows or forced entry			1
' i think there is something going on in the background but i 'm not really sure			0
there are too many people involved			0
' a protective board was erected in front of the @entity5 piece when it was first discovered - the board has since been taken down although happy to continue with the deal , he says he will need several assurances from the council and may offer substantially less money if he has to complete restoration work on the inside			1
he added : ' part of my condition was that the council agree a form of protection on it - some form of bullet proof glass to be put up			2
' obviously , the only point is for people to be able to enjoy it			0
' i 'm really hopeful that we can come up with a glass structure that can protect it			0
it 's about something that looks good and brings tourism to the town			0
' there have been a lot of ups and downs but i 'm determined to keep at it , as long as it is not permanently damaged - i 'm not looking to throw money away			2
' the artwork drew lots of attention from local residents when it first appeared on the end of the terraced house @entity156 has been addressing the situation themselves as the building is listed			1
a council spokesperson said : ' officers from @entity156 's enforcement team entered the property under a warrant of entry recently			1
' mr @entity165 , the owner 's business partner , was interviewed under caution in relation to a potential criminal offence under the @entity170			2
evidence is being gathered and investigations continue			0
' a spokesperson for @entity174 said : ' a report of a burglary was received but the investigation has been completed			0
' we keep an open mind as to the circumstances of the incident			0
as regards to any possible damage to a listed building , that is a matter for the council			2

' @entity10 ' appeared on wall of terraced house in @entity15 in april
after bidding war , property bought by local businessman , @entity19
bought for six - figure sum - he wants profit by selling artwork for £ 1million
but thieves have somehow attempted to remove bricks from inside building
with no forced entry - mr @entity19 *suspects* it was an inside job involving key
