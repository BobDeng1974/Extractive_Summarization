by @entity0 published : 12:25 est , 23 january 2014 updated : 19:49 est , 23 january 2014 sham marriage scams are a massive loophole in @entity6 ’s border controls and provide a ‘ golden ticket ’ for anyone wanting to stay in the country , a report has warned			1
most commonly , the marriages are between ‘ awayday brides ’ from @entity12 who come over for a few days to marry and then return to their home countries			2
their fake husbands are mostly from @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			0
it is estimated that between 3,000 and 10,000 fake weddings a year are taking place			0
undetected : a suspect is taken into custody during a @entity6 @entity27 raids into sham marriages the report by @entity30 , the chief inspector of @entity31 watchdog @entity27 and @entity32 , said : ‘ many register offices refer few , if any , cases of suspected sham marriage to the @entity31 , despite the fact that they have a statutory duty to do so			1
this means that a significant number of sham marriages may be going undetected			1
’ one member of staff told inspectors that sham marriage was a ‘ massive loophole in the immigration rules at the moment ’			1
such was the lack of concern at being caught , many fraudsters still turned up for a marriage even when uniformed immigration officials were in the register office building			1
another loophole is the @entity55 , whose clergymen are not required by law to report suspicious weddings			0
one senior @entity31 manager said in the report that getting residency through sham marriage was akin to a ‘ golden ticket ’			1
loophole : a huge number of sham marriages are going undetected , despite a statutory duty for registry officers to report them to the @entity31 @entity27 and immigration inspector @entity69 told the @entity70 : ‘ there are large , diverse cities in the @entity73 and elsewhere where there are none or very low levels of reporting			1
’ she added : ‘ it is much more difficult to deal with them once they have been married			0
’ anyone who enters a bogus relationship successfully can use it to stay in @entity6 for five years and eventually obtain citizenship			2
mr @entity30 called for beefed up enforcement teams and more efforts to encourage reporting			0
a @entity31 spokesman said : ‘ the government is already taking action to crack down on those who abuse the marriage system to cheat our immigration system			2
and we are determined to do more			0
problem : an enforcement operation at @entity97 register office , north west @entity99 , found arrests were made for sham marriages nearly every day if a sham marriage goes through undetected , the couple gain @entity6 residency for five years and can then apply for a permanent residency ‘ registrars have a duty to report suspected sham marriages to the @entity31 and we are working more closely with the @entity110 to increase awareness			1
‘ the @entity112 will introduce new measures to give our officers and registrars more time to investigate , prosecute and remove those attempting to stage sham marriages			2
’ @entity117 , @entity118 ’s immigration spokesman , said : ‘ this just goes to show that official stats in immigration are totally unreliable			0
when such a senior figure admits to there being such gaping holes it ’s clear to see how easy it is to abuse the system			0

*illegal* nuptials ' undetected ' despite laws saying reports must be made
if sham marriage goes through , couple can obtain residency for five years
they can then settle permanently , even if relationships are not *genuine*
