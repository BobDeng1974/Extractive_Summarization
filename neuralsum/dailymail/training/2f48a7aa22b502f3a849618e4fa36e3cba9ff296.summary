by @entity0 published : 09:28 est , 18 september 2013 updated : 10:06 est , 18 september 2013 a teenager who shed almost six stone after seeing ‘ horrendous ’ prom photos of herself has been crowned @entity4			1
the weightloss has given @entity6 , 18 , from @entity7 , the confidence to go to university to train to be a nurse			1
she has also been crowned @entity11 2013 after going from 16st 11lb to a svelte 11st , dropping five dress sizes			1
@entity6 is now starting @entity18 feeling more confident than ever the 5ft 6in teenager says she had struggled with her weight for years and admitted she used to be a comfort eater			1
she said : ' for as long as i remember i 've always been bigger than my friends			2
i was a very emotional eater , i used food as a reward for doing well or as a comforter if i ’d had a bad day			2
' @entity6 unsuccessfully tried losing dieting for years but could n't stick to cutting out her favourite calorific foods			1
however , weighing in at 17st and struggling to shop for her prom dress , @entity6 ’s grandmother persuaded her to go to a @entity33 with her in april 2012			1
she said : ' at the age of 17 i was almost 17st and i knew something had to change			2
' shopping for my prom dress was probably one of the worst experiences i 've ever had			2
i was so excited and had all these ideas in my head of how i wanted to look , but the reality was that every dress i liked either did n't fit or looked horrendous			0
new woman : the 5ft 6in teenager from @entity7 says she had struggled with her weight for years and admitted she used to be a comfort eater ' i felt so embarrassed that i ended up just wanting to go home			1
i did find a dress in the end but i didnt like any of the photos of me in it			0
' @entity6 found the @entity11 system of eating a balanced diet , rather than a restricted one , was easier for her to stick to and the pounds soon started to fall off			1
she said : ' being able to eat pasta and potatoes without weighing and measuring them out seemed too good to be true , and i loved being able to have a treat like a bar of chocolate or a bag of crisps when i fancied one as well			0
the turning point : it was this photograph , left , that spurred @entity6 to lose weight and she 's since dropped from a dress size 22 to 12 ' it ’s about learning how to balance your diet , not restricting yourself			1
' attending the group each week , @entity6 learned about healthy eating			1
she swapped her unhealthy breakfast of pasties and sausage rolls for cereal with semi-skimmed milk topped with chopped banana or berries			1
she also started cooking her favourite meals - spaghetti bolognese and homemade beef burgers with potato wedges and salad - for herself and her parents , instead of having takeaways			0
the cooking skills she has picked up will serve her well when she starts her first term at @entity18 later this month			0
new diet : the teen swapped her unhealthy breakfast of pasties and sausage rolls for cereal with semi-skimmed milk topped with chopped banana or berries and watched the weight drop off she explained : ' what i liked is that the plan put me in control			1
i was given all the information , support and tools i needed but the choice - about what weight i wanted to be or what i wanted to eat - and the responsibility was mine			0
' it makes me feel so proud of what i ’ve achieved , more so than if i ’d have just been doing as i was told or following some strict regime for a short period of time			0
' i know i ’ll have to live on a fairly tight budget at university but i think i ’ve learned a lot about value for money and how to get healthy , tasty food without spending too much - i love big pasta dishes and jacket potatoes			2
control : she says the diet plan put her in control and she can still eat some treats in moderation ' i still manage to eat out with my friends and go on nights out too so i ’m not worried about socialising either			0
' since starting at @entity11 , @entity6 , who also walks regularly now instead of taking the bus , has dropped from a dress size 22 to a 12			1
it was after she started losing weight that she decided to apply to study the demanding course of mental health nursing at university , saying : ' i know nursing can be quite physical and you ’re on your feet a lot so i was worried i would n’t have been able to cope with that side of things when i was bigger			2
' i ’m sure that my weight loss helped me get accepted onto my course too			0
i think i was able to get across my enthusiasm and passion for nursing because i feel better about myself			0
i feel like i make a better first impression , so i could focus on the interview itself			0
' new life : now she has lost weight , she has the confidence to head to university to study mental health nursing ' i feel better about myself			1
i feel like i make a better first impression , so i could focus on the interview itself ' said @entity6 of gaining a place on the course share what you think the comments below have been moderated in advance			2
