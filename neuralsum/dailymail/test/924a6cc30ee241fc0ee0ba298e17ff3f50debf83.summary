surveys find that men in @entity3 special operations forces do not believe women can meet the physical and mental demands of their commando jobs , and they fear the @entity8 will lower standards to integrate women into their elite units , according to interviews and documents obtained by @entity14			1
studies that surveyed personnel found ' major misconceptions ' within special operations about whether women should be brought into the male - only jobs			1
they also revealed concerns that department leaders would ' capitulate to political pressure , allowing erosion of training standards , ' according to one document			1
up to the mark ? surveys find that men in @entity3 special operations forces do not think women can meet the physical and mental demands of their commando jobs second best : male special op combat troops fear the @entity8 will lower standards to integrate women into their elite units some of those concerns were not limited to men , researchers found , but also were found among women in special operations jobs			1
@entity40 , force management director for @entity3 @entity41 , told the @entity14 that the survey results have ' already driven us to do some different things in terms of educating the force			1
' about 68,800 people serve in the command , including 3,000 civilians			0
the main survey went to about 18,000 people who are in positions closed to women , and the response was about 50 percent			2
the high response rate , officials said , reflects the wide interest in the subject			0
the studies are part of the @entity8 's effort to open all military combat positions to women or provide reasons why any jobs should remain closed			1
one survey , by @entity67 , reflected doubts that women could meet the overall job demands , found concerns that sexual harassment or assault could increase , and cited worries about ' unequal treatment ' of special operations candidates and personnel			1
some worried that if women were let in to some jobs , they might be treated more harshly			2
survey details have not been released			0
this was the first time that officials from @entity41 publicly discussed the results			0
changing times : in the past the military acknowledged that women will not be able to fill every combat role @entity90 , who works with @entity40 and has expertise on this issue , noted that women in special operations jobs had concerns , too , about the broader integration			1
' they 're concerned that this might result in the lowering of the standards in what are currently our male - only occupations , and that would then reflect on either them or on the women who come into those occupations , ' said @entity90			2
@entity8 leaders lifted the ban on women in combat jobs in 2012 , but gave the military services time to integrate women gradually and systematically into the male - only front - line positions			1
by january 2016 , the military must open all combat jobs to women or explain why any exceptions must be made			2
positions within the special operations forces , including the clandestine @entity119 and @entity122 @entity121 units , are considered the most grueling and difficult jobs in the military , with training and qualifying courses that push troops to their physical , mental and emotional limits			1
the commandos often work in small teams in harsh , remote locations			0
as a result , those jobs are some of the last to be addressed as commanders review the qualifications needed and assess the impact of bringing in women			0
as integration unfolds , the surveys have brought home the reality that there are ' some reservations or misperceptions in the force in terms of why we 're doing this , ' @entity40 said			0
defense officials have stressed that they will not reduce standards in order to let in women			0
women have so far had mixed results as they try to move into the more demanding combat positions â€” jobs for which men also have difficulty qualifying			2
new opportunities : in 2013 the @entity8 rescinded its 1994 policy restricting women from serving in combat - focused positions such as infantry units , opening up 230,000 positions to female service members so far , about 7,200 positions within the special operations forces have been opened to women , including combat jobs in the 160th @entity170 , a specialized unit used to fly forces fast , low and deep behind enemy lines at night			1
for the first time , a woman last year made it through training and began serving as a pilot in the unit			0
three female pilots , 25 women in other jobs , and 16 other women are now going through initial training for these helicopter crews , known as @entity186			0
most female soldiers do not want combat jobs , an earlier survey found			0
but among those who do , the @entity186 were a popular choice			0
women have moved into @entity122 artillery jobs and serve on @entity119 submarines and in the naval riverine units			1
but none has made it through the @entity199 ' officer infantry course			0
special operations command leaders have made it clear that genuine concerns exist about incorporating women into some jobs			1
examinations : the studies are part of the @entity8 's effort to open all military combat positions to women or provide reasons why any jobs should remain closed in 2013 , when the planning was in its infancy , then - maj. gen. @entity214 spoke of demanding nature of missions requiring forces ' to operate in small , self - contained teams , many of which are in austere , geographically isolated , politically sensitive environments for extended periods of time			1
' in an email last month to members of the special operations forces across the services , gen. @entity225 , head of @entity41 , said leaders had done initial analysis on training , facilities , education and other policies			1
now , officials are examining ' the social and cultural challenges of integrating females ' into male - only jobs			0
next , @entity225 said , officials will analyze requirements for the jobs to make sure standards are accurate and gender neutral			0
' we will continue in our commitment to provide the best manned , trained , and equipped special operations personnel to execute our nation 's most difficult and sensitive missions , ' @entity225 said			2
' with that in mind , we can assure you that our high standards will not be lowered			0
' @entity40 said that in addition to @entity225 's email to service members , leaders have discussed the issue with commanders at frequent meetings so they can better educate their troops .			2
