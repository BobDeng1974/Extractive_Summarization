by @entity0 published : 02:57 est , 5 october 2012 updated : 06:57 est , 6 october 2012 one of @entity2 's most highly paid police officers became the first chief constable to be sacked in 35 years yesterday			2
@entity4 was found guilty of asking a colleague to inquire about a job for the former police authority chairman 's daughter and subsequently lying about it			1
he was dismissed from his £ 191,905 job as head of @entity12 , where he had been suspended on full pay since his arrest in august last year			1
sacked : @entity4 , pictured receiving the @entity15 , has been dismissed after a police enquiry but the 55 - year - old will still enjoy his full pension of up to £ 128,000			1
mr @entity4 was investigated following allegations about his role in recruiting the daughter of @entity23 to a civilian post			2
it was claimed he used ' undue influence ' to get her the job			1
@entity29 , of the @entity30 , branded mr @entity4 ' shameful ' and said he had failed the force and the public			0
the decision means mr @entity4 escapes a further inquiry into claims that he abused his force credit card and concealed the arrest of his wife , @entity38 , a detective chief inspector , for being drunk and disorderly			1
however , he could yet be prosecuted for corruption and fraud because he is at the centre of an investigation into how @entity12 awarded small - scale contracts for maintenance work and other routine business			2
detective chief inspector @entity38 was arrested by @entity46 on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly in @entity48 on april 4 last year , before they were married			1
she was released with no further action being taken , but she and mr @entity4 , who allegedly knew of the arrest , are suspected of failing to notify their employer , @entity12			1
circumstances surrounding her arrest were referred to the @entity30 ( @entity30 ) by @entity12 and @entity55 in may and an investigation was launched			2
ms @entity38 married mr @entity4 this year and is expecting their baby			2
investigation : mr @entity4 ( left ) was the subject of a separate inquiry over the arrest of his wife , detective chief inspector @entity38 ( right ) the last officer of his rank to be fired on the charge was @entity67 , who lost his job as @entity70 ’s chief constable in 1977 , while former @entity72 chief constable @entity71 left the force , but avoided the sack , after admitting to gross misconduct in 2011			1
@entity30 commissioner @entity29 said mr @entity4 believed his position meant he could order people to do as he wished , adding that his standards have fallen far below what would be expected			0
he said : ' @entity4 's attempts to mislead the @entity30 investigation by lying and putting pressure on a member of staff to lie on his behalf were shameful			1
' ' he almost got away with his attempted deception			0
however , the member of staff in question showed great integrity and courage in refusing to be bullied and stood up to him by asking to submit a new witness statement to the @entity30 , fully explaining mr @entity4 's role in this matter			1
' mr @entity4 appeared to think his position as chief constable gave him the power to order people to do as he wished			2
' a chief constable must set the standards for the police force to follow			0
@entity4 appears to have forgotten this and he set his own standards , which fell far below those that would be expected			0
' he has attempted to intimidate and bully staff under his leadership and mislead an independent investigation			0
' he has failed at that - and , most significantly , he has failed the police officers and staff he led , the police service as a whole and the public of @entity12			1
' mr @entity29 added that @entity55 will drop a further misconduct hearing for mr @entity4 relating to 11 other matters in respect of gross misconduct - but he remains on police bail pending further inquiries in relation to @entity119 , an ongoing inquiry into alleged police misconduct			1
at a news conference at police headquarters in @entity124 , chair of @entity55 @entity126 said the 55 - year - old chief constable was dismissed ' without notice '			1
out : @entity55 agreed in august not to renew mr @entity4 's contract , which expires on march 31 next year mr @entity126 hopes to give details of the misconduct allegations that mr @entity4 was due to face , but which will not be subject to disciplinary proceedings as he is no longer a serving officer , once lawyers allow him to release them			1
' the two aspects that have been found against mr @entity4 are relatively recent , around a recruitment matter , ' he said			2
' there are 18 other charges of gross misconduct that will not be heard relating to periods going back five or six years			1
' i would hope to release details of those charges as soon as that 's appropriate , and people can make their own mind up			0
' he added : ' the two counts that have been found against @entity4 relate around dishonesty and as a police officer that has got to be sacrosanct			1
' as a member of the public , you need to have the utmost faith and trust in a police officer so i am really disappointed			0
' mr @entity4 has let himself down , he has let @entity159 and the people of @entity12			1
' @entity161 , @entity55 chief executive , said that as mr @entity4 had already served 30 years , he was still legally entitled to claim his pension			1
' he will leave with his pension , ' he said			0
' there will be no additional payments made to him			0
' mr @entity4 released a statement denying any wrongdoing			2
he said : ' clearly , i am extremely disappointed with the result today			0
' i believe the disciplinary proceedings have sadly come to an incorrect conclusion			0
' when the judgment was delivered and i was offered the chance to put forward mitigation i declined - the panel was mistaken in their finding and i could not seek to argue for a lesser punishment for something i have n’t done			0
' i will therefore be discussing with my lawyers over the next few days how this can be addressed			0
' mr @entity4 is the first chief constable to be given the axe in 35 years			2
he maintains his innocence he added : ' it is important that the public be aware that the @entity184 carefully studied this file and decided there was no criminal case to answer			0
' whilst the burden of proof at misconduct hearings is of a lower standard i am still perplexed as to why a misconduct panel could have found against me in the light of the evidence presented and the obvious hurdles that were placed in the way of me being able to lay the full facts of this case before the panel			0
' he concluded his statement by adding : ' as chief constable i have been , and remain , immensely proud of the achievements of @entity12 and the dedication of its officers and staff			2
' they have produced record falls in crime and disorder and won the confidence and support of the communities they serve , winning the title of police force of the year in 2011			0
i am confident this success will continue			0
' on a personal note , i continue to deny any wrongdoing is this or any other matter			0
' he said he will continue with a legal claim that he was unlawfully arrested and detained			0
inquiry : @entity4 was suspended from his job at @entity12 headquarters after he was arrested in august 2011 sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			1

@entity4 of @entity12 found guilty of gross misconduct
he used ' undue influence ' to get job for colleague 's daughter and tried to *persuade* another staff member to ' lie for him '
former officer continues to deny any wrongdoing , seeks legal *advice*
@entity4 escapes further inquiry into claims he concealed the arrest of his wife , a detective chief inspector , for being drunk and disorderly
disgraced officer still entitled to pension for 30 - year career
