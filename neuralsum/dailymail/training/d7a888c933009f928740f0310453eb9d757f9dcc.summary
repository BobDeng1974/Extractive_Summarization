by @entity0 published : 10:55 est , 25 april 2013 updated : 03:24 est , 26 april 2013 while brands everywhere up their prices to cope with the recession , one company has done the opposite			0
clothing firm @entity6 has unveiled a 99p dress - a long black maxi dress with silver detail that is a classic addition to the summer wardrobe			1
many will be excited by the budget offering			0
after all , there 's no denying the dress is a bargain			2
but it would be wise to remember that such cut - price offerings are often clever marketing stunts to increase traffic - and sales - for a site			0
the average shopper who visits the site to buy the dress will be faced with a £ 2.95 postage cost on top of the cost of the dress ( taking the total to £ 3.94 ) - rising to £ 5.95 for next day delivery			2
and most will find it hard to resist snapping up another item or two while they are logged on			0
bargain : the 99p summer maxi is a long black dress with plunging sweetheart neckline what better way to make that postage ' worthwhile ' than by buying a few more bits and pieces ? still , with the rest of the items priced reasonably too , this is not going to stretch the purse - strings of the budget - conscious fashionista too far			1
the black full - length dress is a sensible summer buy : classic shape , loosely ruched at the waist with a plunging sweetheart neckline			2
silver clasps gather the straps together			0
@entity54 caused the web to go into meltdown last year with a similar offer : a 99p sequinned party dress unveiled prior to the @entity60 office party season			1
this time , the website will make 1,000 dresses available for sale on their website at midnight tonight			0
' with the great success last year with the 99p party dress we have decided to repeat this offer with a maxi dress for the summer , ' said spokeswoman @entity69			1
last october 's party dress sale saw 300 dresses sell out in 15 minutes after more than 100,000 people visited the @entity6 website , causing it to crash under the heavy traffic			1
the new 99p dress goes on sale at midnight tonight - and they 're predicting a surge of sales clever trick : the £ 99 party dress released in december last year sold out almost instantly			1

dress is made of 95 **%** *viscose* and 5 **%** *elastane*
@entity6 released first 99p dress in december
