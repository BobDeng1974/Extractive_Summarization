by @entity0 could switching on the tv prevent you from switching off ? after a long , stressful day at work , kicking back in front of the tv might seem like the best way to unwind			1
but a new study found that rather than helping us relax , watching tv can make us feel more worse than when we started			2
the study , by researchers at the @entity10 , @entity11 , and @entity12 , found that people who had high stress levels after work and watched tv or played video games did n't feel relaxed or recovered , but instead had high levels of guilt and feelings of failure			1
the study , titled ' @entity23 ' , surveyed 471 participants about how they felt after work and what media they had use to unwind			1
they found that people who were particularly tired after work showed a higher tendency to feel they had ' succumbed to their desire ' when describing their tv or gaming use			2
this group of people also reported that their tv watching had prevented them ' taking care of more important tasks '			1
in other words , instead of taking enjoyment from switching on the box or playing games , this hard - working bunch felt guilty about it			1
' these feelings of guilt diminished the positive effects of media use and reduced recovery and vitality after media use , ' reports the study , which has recently been published in the @entity52			0
the results also found a surprising paradox : people who were most exhausted and therefore could have benefited most from relaxing in front of the tv , actually benefited least because they felt most guilty and took their tv habit as a sign of their own self - control failure			1
this research sheds new light on the effects tv and gaming			0
previous studies have found that this sort of media use helps us to detach from work stress and to relax			0
research has also found that winning in a computer game or watching a thought - provoking movie gives people a feeling of control during leisure time , which in turn makes them feel more energized and can even increase cognitive performance			2
@entity79 , one of ' @entity23 ' authors says of their findings , ' it demonstrates that in real life , the relationship between media use and well - being is complicated and that the use of media may conflict with other , less pleasurable but more important duties and goals in everyday life			0
' so next time you 're heading for the couch after work , think before you flick			0
feelings of guilt and failure can be brought on by watching tv			0
