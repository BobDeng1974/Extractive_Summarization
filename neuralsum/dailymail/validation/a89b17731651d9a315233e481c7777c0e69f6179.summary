you 've heard of wedding crashers			0
@entity2 is a bachelor party crasher - of sorts			1
for weeks , the father - of - one from the @entity7 suburbs found himself getting emails from people he did n't know about a bachelor party 2,800 miles away in @entity11 and a groom he 's never met			1
he saw names of the city 's landmarks like @entity16 thrown around in the emails but could n't put his finger on where they were located until he searched the names online			1
the wrong guest : @entity2 of @entity23 , @entity24 , started receiving emails from people he had never met about a bachelor party			1
he then came clean about the mistake , but the groom decided to invite him anyway ' i had no idea what any of these places are , ' said @entity2 , 31 , who 's never been to the @entity34			1
' after googling them , everything was pointing to @entity11			2
' it turns out @entity2 , an information technology worker and a married father of one in @entity23 , @entity24 , had been mistaken for a friend of the groom with a similar last name			1
he sat as a ' @entity43 ' for much of the email chain until monday , when he broke the news after the groom 's brother wanted a headcount of people attending the party			2
but it did n't end there			0
@entity54 @entity53 , 34 , figured : why not still invite him ? the @entity11 real estate agent asked him to attend both the bachelor party march 28 and his wedding may 2 in @entity58			1
' this is the city of brotherly love , ' @entity53 said , even telling @entity61 he could be his best man			2
' any and all are welcome			0
' the groom : when those who were invited to the bachelor party saw a picture of @entity2 they said he could actually be related to the groom - @entity53 @entity2 went online and set up a @entity70 page to tell his story and raise money to cover his travel			1
in less than a week , he 's already hit his goal of a little more than $ 1,200 and is putting any more money raised toward @entity53 's honeymoon			1
the groom promises the bachelor party will be a low - key affair at some bars , maybe a casino , to watch @entity82 unfold			0
and while he wo n't actually get to be the best man — that 's reserved for @entity53 's 11 - year - old cousin — @entity2 has his plane ticket ready to go for next weekend to see a city he 's never been to and hang out with a group of guys he 's never met			1
he set up a @entity70 page when he learned he was invited , and has since raised more than $ 2,000 from the groom @entity53 : people , has anyone else noticed now that @entity53 has been rocking the beard for a while - he looks like a middle aged @entity94 ? at times , he also has ventured into a bit of hipster phase			1
in addition to publicly questioning his fashion choices , his bachelor party will be a good time for us to celebrate him leading up to his wedding			0
@entity104 finally comes clean : hi all , so , i have no idea who any of you guys are , but i have been enjoying being a fly on the wall hearing about the plans for this bachelor party over the last few months			2
i 'm assuming my e-mail address was added to the list by mistake ( perhaps a typo of someone else ? )			0
i live out in @entity7 , @entity24 and although for a moment i thought it might be funny to just show up and be that guy nobody knows but everyone wonders " who is that guy ? " , buying a plane ticket for a cross-country flight just to crash a bachelor 's party might be a bit over the top ( although it would be epic ! )			1
nonetheless , i do hope you guys have a great time and i 'd like to take a moment to wish the best of luck in life to the groom ! cheers ! @entity2 @entity7 , @entity24 members of the party start to reply i say everyone forks up an extra $ 20 and we get @entity2 a plane ticket to @entity11 ! and i just facebooked @entity2 in @entity24 , and if this is you - you actually look like you could be related to groom			1
@entity146 mr @entity147 replies about the picture on @entity149 haha ... yes , that is indeed me with my ( now 2 - year old , she was about 3 - months there ) daughter , @entity152			0
speaking of bachelor parties , weddings , and the like , that shot was actually taken at a wedding for a buddy of mine who also , coincidentally , happens to now live out on the @entity160 ( @entity161 )			0
small world ! indeed , i think i recall seeing a picture of the groom over the last few months , and noticed this as well			0
i 'm of course glad to know he 's a studly guy - his soon - to - be - wife is a lucky woman ! @entity168 : still kind of a mystery to me how i got on this thread , as i 've never been to @entity171 or anywhere in the @entity174 part of our country for that matter			0
but , you guys seem like a cool bunch nonetheless			0
perhaps i 'll have to drop you folks a line if i ever make it out there for tips on tourist - type things to check out			0
the groom @entity104 then replies @entity104 , i 'm overnighting you a wedding invite			2
you show up at the bachelor party and ill make you my best man			0
you can give the toast even @entity53 he then posted an update based on the news on @entity149			2
a number of his friends told him to go			0
