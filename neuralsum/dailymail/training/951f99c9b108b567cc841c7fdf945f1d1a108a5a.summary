the excruciating condition is on the rise - and @entity13 researchers say a bi-product of the vitamin may be to blame			2
men who took vitamin c supplements at least once a day had the highest risk of kidney stones			1
the condition affects 12 per cent of men and four per cent of women in the @entity22			1
' it has long been suspected that high doses of vitamin c may increase the risk of kidney stones , said lead researcher @entity28 , from the @entity29 in @entity30			1
this is because some of the vitamin c absorbed by the body is excreted in urine as oxalate , one of the key components of kidney stones			1
stones are made up of tiny crystals , which can be formed by calcium combining with oxalate			2
the study tracked more than 22,000 middle - aged and elderly for 11 years			0
the current analysis included 907 men who said they took regular vitamin c tablets and more than 22,000 who did n't use any nutritional supplements			2
@entity13 supplements , like those the study participants would have taken , typically contain about 1,000 milligrams ( mg ) of vitamin c per tablet			0
most vitamin c supplements sold in the @entity22 contain either 500 or 1,000 mg. a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice contains around 120mg			1
the condition affects 12 per cent of men and four per cent of women in the @entity22 of the vitamin c users , 3.4 per cent developed kidney stones for the first time during the study , compared to 1.8 per cent of non-supplement users			1
the findings appear in the journal @entity69			0
the researchers said hat because there are no clear benefits tied to taking high - dose vitamin c , people who have had stones in the past might want to think before taking extra supplements			2
but the findings do not mean people should n't get plenty of vitamin c through fruits and vegetables , since the antioxidant is important for bone and muscle health - and severe deficiency can cause scurvy			0
' @entity92 is an important part of a healthy diet , ' @entity91 said			0
' any effect of vitamin c on kidney stone risk is likely to depend both on the dose and on the combination of nutrients with which it is ingested			2
' kidney stones are stone - like lumps that can develop in one or both of the kidneys			1
the waste products in the blood can occasionally form crystals that collect inside the kidneys			0
over time , the crystals may build up to form a hard stone - like lump			0
after a kidney stone has formed , the body tries to pass it out in urine			1
if a stone is small , this may even go undetected			0
however , it is fairly common for a stone to block part of the urinary system , such as the ureter ( the tube connecting the kidney to the bladder ) or the urethra ( the tube through which urine passes out of the body )			1
if this happens , it can cause crippling pain in the back , abdomen or groin , painful urinary infections and in some cases , kidney failure			2
many people who have suffered kidney stones descibe the pain as ' excruciating ' and worse than child birth			1
‘ our modern lifestyles are responsible , particularly because we do n’t drink enough water and eat the wrong foods , ’ explains @entity140 , a consultant urologist at @entity141 , @entity142			0
a poor diet and dehydration are major risk factors ( @entity149 has one of the highest kidney stone rates in the world )			0
certain people have higher than average levels of stone - forming chemicals in their body called oxalate			0
this means cutting down coffee , spinach and rhubarb – all of which are high - oxalate foods .			0
