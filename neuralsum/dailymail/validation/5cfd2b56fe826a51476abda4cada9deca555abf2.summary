@entity0 has declared @entity1 and recalled striker @entity2 are ready to work together at long last as he prepares to field the nation 's ' best out - and - out goalscorer ' in a competitive fixture for the first time in 18 months			1
the national manager kept the @entity9 hitman in exile as he went about honing a system for the improving @entity12 , saying that @entity2 was not a fit for the international game he wished to create			1
but the striker followed up his surprise return to the squad with a substitute appearance in the midweek friendly win over @entity20 — and @entity0 last confirmed on saturday that the 25 - year - old will be let loose on minnows @entity22 at some stage of the @entity26 qualifier on sunday			1
recalled @entity1 striker @entity2 has been called his country 's ' best out - and - out goalscorer ' @entity1 manager @entity0 had left @entity30 out of the side while he changed his formation @entity2 made his return to the @entity1 set - up with an appearance against @entity20 on wednesday @entity0 is set to deviate from his 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 formation in a bid for goals and that could hand @entity2 a start in a two - man strike force against the @entity43 rookies			1
it would prove a hit with the @entity46 , whose favourite @entity2 ' last appearance in a qualifying game was as a substitute in a 2 - 0 defeat by @entity52 in september 2013 , after which @entity0 said he was committed to a style that ' does n't suit ' the £ 8million forward			1
now @entity2 and @entity0 's plans are equipped to blend , with the manager explaining : ' i think we 've evolved since he was last in the squad and , although he has not evolved with us , i think he has the intelligence to get better all the time because he can take things in			1
' but i think he would find it easier playing with us now than it was two years ago			0
i 'd say we make it easier for a striker to play with us now			2
' he 's probably the best out - and - out goalscorer we 've got			2
but that was n't the criteria to get us kick - started back then with where we wanted to go			2
' @entity2 missed 11 @entity1 fixtures during his omission but is set to earn a 14th cap with a second @entity71 appearance in five days			1
' ( his selection ) ca n't be a one - off because we are playing two games , ' said @entity0			2
' he 's already been playing in one and he 's going to play in another one			0
' we have a few players who could find this the right type of game for them			0
i picked the squad with that in mind			0
it 's up to everyone to play well enough to be in the side			0
' i ca n't say anyone will have a major role in the future			0
if i said ' he has a major role ' and someone comes into the position and is better , he 'll have a major role			0
it 's up to you to play well enough to be in there			0
' @entity2 ( right ) , who has been in impressive club form , celebrates with @entity9 team - mate @entity99			1

@entity9 striker @entity2 has been *welcomed* back into the @entity1 set up following a 11 - game *absence*
manager @entity0 had kept @entity30 out of the side as he *tinkered* with *tactics* and formations
now though , @entity0 is ready to make use of the forward against @entity22
