by @entity0 ' the @entity1 has blood on its hands ' : @entity4 on tv with @entity6			1
his comments have led to accusations that he is siding with @entity10 @entity4 refused to back down yesterday after he was accused of siding with @entity10 in claiming the @entity1 has blood on its hands over the crisis in @entity14			1
the @entity16 leader provoked controversy by using a tv debate with @entity6 to insist that both @entity19 and @entity20 are to blame for @entity21 seizing @entity22			1
critics from all three main parties accused him of allowing his hatred of the @entity1 to lead him into mirroring the arguments of @entity10 , which have prompted worldwide condemnation			1
but mr @entity4 insisted the @entity29 had given false hope to people in @entity14 of closer ties with @entity33 in the full knowledge that it would antagonise @entity10 and prompt a military response			1
‘ i ’m not sure how this is controversial : there is a clear pattern of behaviour on how @entity21 reacts to eastward @entity1 expansion and it ’s not with invitations for a tea party and a polite chat , ’ he said			1
the @entity16 leader said the government had ‘ geed up the @entity1 ’ to pursue an ‘ imperialist , expansionist ’ policy which had meant leading people in the @entity14 to believe that their future could lie with @entity33			1
‘ they actually toppled their own elected leader , ' he said			0
‘ that provoked mr @entity10 , and i think the @entity1 frankly does have blood on its hands in the @entity14			1
’ mr @entity4 said later that he did not support the @entity21 invasion of @entity22 , but insisted : ‘ if you poke the @entity21 bear with a stick he will respond			1
’ former @entity16 leader @entity58 backed mr @entity4 , saying : ‘ @entity21 has been making it known for years that it could n’t , ca n’t and wo n’t tolerate the @entity22 coming under the sphere of influence of the corrupt octopus in @entity20			1
’ mr @entity6 , who clashed with mr @entity4 on jobs and immigration in the first of two tv debates on the @entity1 , said @entity16 ’s claims were shocking and an insult to democracy campaigners in @entity70 who rose up after president @entity71 rejected an association deal with the @entity1 , preferring closer ties with @entity21			1
dozens were killed in the violence			0
‘ it shows quite how extreme people can be , like @entity4 , when their loathing of the @entity1 becomes so all - consuming that they even end up siding with @entity10 in order to make their point , ’ mr @entity6 told @entity76			1
@entity21 soldiers and their dog in @entity22 : mr @entity4 said later that he did not support the @entity21 invasion of the @entity87 peninsula , but insisted : ' if you poke the @entity21 bear with a stick he will respond ' international development minister @entity91 said of mr @entity4 : ‘ i expected him to be populist , to twist the facts and to blow his dog whistle on immigration			1
‘ what i did n’t expect was to hear him taking his talking points straight from the @entity99			0
when the subject of @entity14 came up , @entity4 ’s answer was “ i agree with @entity101 ”			1
’ mr @entity6 faced his own difficulties after claiming in the debate that only 7 per cent of @entity19 law originates in @entity20			2
it emerged that the deputy prime minister ’s figure relates only to primary legislation and the true figure is estimated at between 15 per cent and 50 per cent			0
analysis by @entity111 , conservative @entity112 @entity4 claimed : seventy - five per cent of our laws come from the @entity1			2
@entity115 claimed : it ’s only 7 per cent			0
seat of power ? as much as half of @entity19 's laws are rooted in edicts handed down by the @entity1 , according to to a @entity123 briefing note the facts : @entity4 ’s figure is an estimate based on two others – a survey by @entity130 ’s @entity129 which looked at every law passed in @entity130 and found 84 per cent emanated from @entity20 , and the opinion of @entity134 ’s @entity33 commissioner @entity133 who said the figure was 70 per cent			2
@entity4 , in effect , split the difference			2
@entity6 said his 7 per cent figure was in a @entity140 briefing note			0
in fact , it mentioned the figure of 6.8 per cent only as a proportion of the @entity19 ’s primary legislation directly made by the @entity1			0
it added that several other laws were generated by @entity1 rules , concluding : ‘ all measurements have their problems and it is possible to justify any measure between 15 per cent and 50 per cent or thereabouts			0
’ verdict ? @entity4 ’s figure was sloppy , but @entity6 ’s was downright dishonest			1
@entity115 : three million jobs are linked to our trade with the @entity1			0
if we were outside , those jobs would be at risk			0
@entity4 : we buy much more from the @entity1 than we sell – £ 150billion a year compared to £ 100billion – and it ’s inconceivable that the other @entity1 states would jeopardise their exports to us simply because we withdrew from their political arrangements			2
the facts : @entity6 ’s three million figure is a decade old and , in any case , the pro-european who came up with it has since disowned it			0
no one seriously claims that if @entity19 withdrew from the @entity1 we would be excluded from the common market			0
almost every other @entity172 country – from @entity173 and the @entity174 to @entity175 and @entity176 – trades freely with the @entity1			0
@entity4 was right to point to the balance of our trade with the @entity1 , which has been negative in 39 of the 40 years of our membership ( while we have run a cumulative surplus with the rest of the world )			2
verdict ? @entity184 win for @entity4			0
@entity6 's claim that a withdrawal from the @entity1 could send millions marching to the @entity187 does n't stand up @entity115 : a @entity16 leaflet had suggested that 29million @entity190 and @entity191 immigrants might settle in @entity19 whereas , in fact , the two countries ’ joint populations are not even 29million			1
@entity4 : the figure had changed because a couple of million had already emigrated to other @entity1 states			2
in any case , every one of the @entity1 ’s nearly 500million people has the right to settle in the @entity19			0
the facts : the combined population of @entity190 and @entity191 is 27.5million			0
provisionally , the @entity204 puts the total number from the two countries living in the @entity19 ( including those who had arrived before restrictions were lifted in january ) , below 200,000			0
@entity4 is right that the free movement of people is an inescapable requirement of @entity1 membership – though this does not qualify them to free benefits			2
@entity16 damaged its case by its hysterical predictions at the end of last year , and @entity6 is right to point out that @entity1 migrants to @entity19 have , so far , generated more in tax than they have claimed in welfare			1
verdict ? win on points for @entity6 .			0

@entity16 leader refuses to back down after criticism from three major parties
he had accused @entity1 of ' imperialist , expansionist ' policy over @entity14
' if you poke the @entity21 bear with a stick he will respond , ' @entity4 said
@entity6 calls his remarks an insult to *pro-democracy* campaigners in @entity70
but deputy pm faces criticism over sloppy use of statistics in debate
