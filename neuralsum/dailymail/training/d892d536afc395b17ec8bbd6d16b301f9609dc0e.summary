by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:19 est , 25 july 2013 updated : 07:21 est , 26 july 2013 the archbishop of @entity3 today admitted he was ' embarrassed ' to discover that the @entity4 had a stake in controversial payday lender @entity6			1
the @entity8 @entity7 has declared war on companies charging inflated rates of interest and vowed to expand credit unions to act as an alternative , in a move backed by the government			1
but yesterday it emerged that the @entity4 's pension fund invests in one of @entity6 's key financial backers - and the @entity2 said today that the @entity4 must ' ensure this does n't happen again '			1
battle : archbishop of canterbury @entity7 has vowed to put @entity6 out of business and even met with the payday lender 's founder @entity25 ( right ) to tell him			1
but tonight it emerged the @entity4 is linked to the firm the fund , which claims to have an ethical investment policy that bans companies involved in payday lending , has a stake in @entity34 , a @entity35 venture capital firm which raised funds for @entity6 in 2009			1
when asked on @entity37 's today programme whether he was ' embarrassed ' by the revelation , mr @entity7 replied , ' yes i am ' , adding : ' i was irritated for a few minutes , but these things happen			1
' he vowed that the @entity4 would withdraw its investment from @entity6 , saying : ' it should n't happen - it 's very embarrassing , but these things do happen			1
we have to find out why and make sure it does n't happen again			1
' the archbishop suggested that the @entity4 would revise rules allowing it to invest in companies which make up to a quarter of their revenues from lending at sky - high rates of interest			1
' they should n't be invested in @entity6 , we do n't think it 's a good thing , ' he said			1
' we have to review these levels and make sure that we are consistent between what we 're saying and what we 're doing			1
' we think that the payday lenders charge vastly excessive amounts for the loans they make			0
this is something that really matters to me			0
' objections : payday loan company @entity6 charges 5,853 per cent annual interest rates on short term loans			1
to great embarrassment , the @entity4 ’s pension fund admitted it invests in one of @entity6 ’s key financial backers however , mr @entity7 also insisted that mistakes such as this one are inevitable in world of investing , due to the complicated nature of the financial world			1
' we 've got to live in the real world , and living in the real world means that life is complicated and you ca n't escape the complexity , ' he said			1
asked if the @entity4 was breaking its rules , he replied : ' it 's a perfectly valid point			1
is a little sin intolerable ? ' @entity87 is a bad thing by definition			0
just for the record , i 'm not in favour of sin			0
' by launching an attack on payday loan firms the archbishop of @entity3 has sent a message that they are the scourge of the high street			2
he clearly believes the @entity4 could and should offer better help to the most financially in need			0
but innovative as his plan is , it will never be the answer to this spiralling debt crisis			0
credit unions are too small , extremely localised and many are n’t well enough financed to cope with the soaring demand from those who want to borrow for just a few days			0
they are bound by tight regulations , while many loan firms operate in the @entity112			0
rather , the archbishop should point a finger of blame at the banks and encourage them to do more			2
many are forced into the arms of payday lenders because the cost of short - term borrowing at the banks is so high			0
borrowing £ 200 in an unauthorised overdraft for ten days at one major high street bank would cost £ 87			0
that ’s an interest rate , known as an apr , of 15million per cent			2
with @entity6 the same borrowing costs £ 26.05 at an apr of 5,853 per cent			1
yet few have questioned why banks have been allowed to wash their hands of small borrowers			0
it is little wonder those forced to look to less well - known firms found themselves in trouble			0
last year 36,413 borrowers contacted debt charity @entity139 because they were struggling with payday loans of an average £ 1,657			0
just 12 months earlier , the number of complaints was half this amount and the size of the debt about a third less			0
thousands of customers have been allowed to take five or more loans and three - quarters of firms fail to check incomes of applicants			0
the cowboys are ruining lives and it is going to take a new sheriff and a few good men such as the archbishop to stop this scourge			2
some have suggested that @entity4 should not be involved with the financial markets at all - the credit unions they are supporting charge annual interest rates of up to 80 per cent , far more than @entity165 banks			2
but the @entity2 said the @entity4 should ' put our money where our mouth is ' , adding : ' we do n't stand on the sidelines on some sort of great podium lecturing everyone else			2
' he continued : ' i do n't think capitalism is necessarily amoral - it can sometimes be immoral , but it is not of itself immoral			2
' although much of the debate has focussed on high - profile lenders such as @entity6 , mr @entity7 said that ' the worst people are not @entity6 ' and claimed his campaign was targeted more at loan sharks than professionally managed companies			1
a @entity182 spokesman said : ‘ we are grateful to the @entity184 for pointing out this serious inconsistency of which we were unaware			0
‘ we will be asking the assets committee of the @entity187 to investigate how this has occurred and to review the holding			2
’ after @entity190 added his voice to those criticising what he called ' @entity194 ' , calling the archbishop 's plans ' interesting and right ' , the lender hit back by insisting it was not an ' unacceptable business '			1
in a statement setting out ' 10 commitments ' to being a responsible body , @entity6 said it agreed with much of what mr @entity7 has said and vowed to prevent customers from racking up spiralling levels of debt			1
the archbishop 's ' comment that he wants to " compete @entity6 out of existence " has been interpreted by some as meaning we are an unacceptable business , ' the firm said			1
' some have taken it a step further , saying we make unaffordable loans to the most vulnerable in society			0
' the company promised to be transparent about the price of its loans , carry out thorough credit checks , and freeze interest after two months to protect defaulting customers			0
ministers have been criticised for failing to cap interest rates , which can top 5,000 per cent a year			0
but chancellor @entity228 said he agreed with much of what the @entity8 @entity7 is proposing			1
he told @entity230 : ‘ i also agree that we ’ve got to make sure that payday lending and the like is properly regulated , which it has n’t been before			0
‘ i have huge amount of time and respect for @entity7			1
i personally appointed him to the @entity235 because of his expertise			0
’ @entity238 business secretary @entity237 also backed the @entity4 ’s intervention , declaring : ‘ the archbishop of @entity3 has hit the nail on the head			2
’ he told @entity243 : ‘ credit unions are a better way of providing credit for people on a lower income who are not credit - worthy and ca n’t use banks			0
‘ we ’ve got to have an alternative and the archbishop is right not just to condemn abuse but to offer alternatives which are more ethical			2
’ the archbishop wants credit unions to use church buildings across 9,000 communities to expand access to credit unions			2
he has called for volunteers who have experience in finance to come forward and help run credit unions to compete with the £ 2billion - a - year payday industry			0
credit unions are community based not - for - profit organisations offering loans , savings accounts and even mortgages			0
deadlock : @entity267 has refused to wear @entity269 's new strip sponsored by loans company @entity6 they are usually linked to one community or industry , such as the @entity274 , and have been regulated by the @entity275 since 2002			1
around one million @entity276 are members of the nation ’s 500 credit unions			1
firms such as @entity6 have grown in popularity as banks tightened up their lending in the wake of the financial crisis			1
in an interview with @entity286 , a former oil executive , said : ‘ i ’ve met the head of @entity6 and we had a very good conversation and i said to him quite bluntly “ we ’re not in the business of trying to legislate you out of existence , we ’re trying to compete you out of existence ”			1
‘ we ’ve got to have credit unions that are both engaged in their communities and much more professional and the third thing is people have got to know about them			0
it ’s a decade - long process			0
we ’re putting our money where our mouth is , we ’re starting a @entity4 staff credit union			0
’ @entity6 ’s chief executive @entity25 said : ‘ i ’m all for better consumer choice			1
the archbishop is clearly an exceptional individual and someone who understands the power of innovation			2
’ he said they discussed banking , financial services and the digital society and had a ‘ meeting of minds on many big issues ’			2
the payday loan industry was referred last month to the @entity319 for an investigation over concerns some lenders were trying to ‘ distort ’ competition .			0
