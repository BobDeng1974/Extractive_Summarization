a ' superhero ' scientist has ventured into one of the most radioactive places in the world - scaling missile defence system towers , getting bitten by ' radioactive ' ants and eating contaminated apples that have grown on trees close to @entity10 's epicentre			1
@entity12 scientist @entity11 has attracted thousands of subscribers to her @entity15 channel for her visits into the @entity10 exclusion zone , the site of a devastating nuclear explosion 29 years ago on april 26 , 1986 , as she measures the high levels of radiation still lingering in the air			1
since the disaster the site has been closed off to the world , with @entity27 scientists agreeing that the area is n't habitable for humans for at least 20,000 years			0
despite this , the daredevil researcher claims she has exposed herself to more radiation swimming in the sea and visiting hospital - and says the most scared she 's felt during her six visits was getting dangerously close to a rabid fox and walking by abandoned , dilapidated buildings			1
the area was devastated by a huge nuclear explosion in 1986 , but that has n't stopped the scientist exploring into the no - go zone to film speaking to @entity56 wo n't give her real name – because ' nobody should adore a scientist , one should adore his or her work ' – but explains how she has come to ' love ' the disaster zone			0
' at first it was just about the radiation , the contamination , measuring what was going on			0
by now , it 's for a love of the place ' , she said			0
' nobody who has not seen this place is able to fully grasp this ; a lot of people will think it 's crazy			0
' but if you 've been there and experienced the zone as it truly is - a time capsule - you will understand			0
@entity81 : an abandoned experiment room in @entity10 , untouched since the destructive accident in 1986			2
31 people died in the immediate aftermath abandoned : a derelict operating room in @entity87 - the ' ground zero ' city when the nuclear reactor exploded			0
@entity11 says visiting the abandoned site is like stepping back in time damage : the broken pressure gauges from the nuclear power station 's control room after the nuclear reactor exploded 29 years ago relaxed : @entity11 at the foot of the @entity99 radar system - known as the @entity99 - in the heart of the @entity10 exclusion zone ' @entity102 stopped the moment the reactor blew , and i do n't just mean the readings on the clocks ... and if you embrace it , you can understand the zone 's true meaning			1
' the 29th anniversary of the disaster was marked on sunday , and it is still regarded as the worst nuclear power plant accident in history			0
thirty - one people died in the direct aftermath , but the long term effects of the population living close by are still being investigated			0
as well as conducting scientific experiments measuring the amount of radiation with her bright yellow @entity125 counter , @entity11 's videos also show the eeriness of the once thriving and busy area , now abandoned and inhospitable			1
yet despite the obvious dangers , @entity11 says she has exposed herself to more radiation when going for a medical procedure in hospital - and is more likely to get skin cancer by swimming in the sea without wearing sunscreen			1
' the received dose of radiation [ in @entity137 ] was far too minor ' , she said			0
' if anything , the medical procedures have exposed me to far greater amounts of radiation than @entity10 ever will , so if i was to have a ' radiation induced cancer ' , i probably got it at the emergency room			1
the @entity10 power plant after the disaster in 1986 on april 26			2
1986 , a sudden power surge at the nuclear power plant in @entity10 , near the city of @entity87 , led to a huge explosion of the reactor which cast highly radioactive particles into the air			1
the plume spread over wide areas of the then - @entity157 and eastern @entity158 , leading to some 350,400 people having to be evacuated and resettled from the most contaminated areas in @entity161 , @entity27 and @entity162			2
the fight to contain the contamination led to more than half a million emergency workers exposing themselves to high doses of radiation , and cost 18 billion rubles			0
the deaths of 31 people - all reactor staff or emergency workers - were directly attributed to the disaster , while the @entity173 predicts the eventual death toll could reach 4,000 among those with a high level of radiation			2
the @entity178 was set up by the @entity157 military directly after the disaster and covers around 30km of the site , including the epi - centre of the blast			0
it is one of the most radioactively contaminated areas in the world - but there are still 197 ' @entity188 ' , or ' illegal residents ' of the area who refused to move out			1
tourism to the zone is growing , thanks in part to the popularity of video games including @entity198 : @entity199 and @entity200 source : @entity202 relaxed : bionerd with her @entity125 counters measuring radiation in @entity10			1
she has visited the site six times to film her experiments radiation : @entity11 's array of @entity125 counters , which measure the amount of ionizing radiation in the air including alpha particles , beta particles and gamma rays death trap : more dangerous than the radiation , @entity11 says , are the derelict buildings on the brink of structural collapse predator : the @entity10 exclusion zone has become popular with wildlife , including this rabies - ridden fox ' it was very stupid of me to go swimming in the sea multiple times without re-applying sun protection , and i hope i wo n't have to pay for this ignorance one day			1
' ' when necessary - which which was very few occasions - i was wearing gloves and / or a respirator and / or shoe protection so i do n't get contaminated ' , she added			2
' i was extremely cautious about the buildings , as some of them have partially collapsed and are highly dangerous to enter			0
' being buried by a collapsing wall is the true physical danger in the @entity10 exclusion zone			2
' i was also carefully looking out for animals , especially as rabies is a big issue in any rural area in the @entity27 - and thus , also in the @entity10 exclusion zone , which is a wildlife habitat more than anything else			1
' her encounter with a rabid fox is one of the few times on @entity11 's @entity15 videos that you hear genuine panic in her voice , as the wild creature comes dangerously close to her car			1
reflecting on the impact that nuclear disasters such as @entity10 has had on the surrounding environment , @entity11 said she does n't see it as an ' ideal ' energy source			1
' in regard to stuff going really wrong , well , that rarely happens - in comparison to total running reactors versus time - and even if it does , it kills a lot less people in total than mining for coal or the smog resulting from emissions from coal plants			0
untouched : the operator console of the control room for the nuclear reactor in @entity10			2
the site has barely been touched since the explosion defiant : @entity11 and her colleagues in nuclear reactors five and six over the potential reactor core - right in the heart of @entity10 ( see arrow )			1
she says she wants a reliable energy source before shutting nuclear power plants but after coal , it 's still the second - worst source of power because of all that waste that is produced			2
both the chemicals during separation and enrichment of uranium or spent fuel as well as the radioactive waste that results in the end of a fuel cycle are a huge issue			0
' in theory , i 'd say ' research nuclear reactors : yes ! nuclear power as an energy source : no ! ' but there , look at me - on my computer , with the lights on , drinking some coffee i have just prepared using one @entity311 of power			0
' we should also look into means of producing cleaner energy , for example nuclear fusion			0
dangerous : the sealed - off @entity10 nuclear power plant , pictured in march 2015 massive : bionerd at the foot of the detection system			1
she said she finds the attention to her videos ' quite awkward ' ' but i can not demand that we shut off coal plants followed by nuclear power plants within the next ten years , as we need to have a true , reliable and sufficient alternative before that step			0
' and while @entity11 's videos are rightly receiving praise from around the world due to their scientific content , many have flocked to praise @entity11 's punk style and good looks			1
how does she feel about that attention ? ' if somebody flatters me , it 's quite awkward - kind of like if you hand in a manuscript to a book your have put a lot of time and effort into while writing it , and the publisher then writes back to you and just says that you have an absolutely beautiful and marvellous handwriting			2
' it 's not a bad thing , but it 's not really what you want to hear , either			0

*anonymous* *vlogger* @entity11 has become cult figure in the science world for her *thrilling* videos shot in @entity10
during visits to measure radiation she 's been bitten by ' radioactive ' ants and eaten contaminated apples from trees
says she 's more likely to get cancer from swimming in the sea - but officials say it 's so dangerous to live there
