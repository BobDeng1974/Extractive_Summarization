' i called for help for someone to get me an ambulance but there was n't time			0
' i could hear the sirens when april just whooshed out onto the floor			0
' i was in such disbelief that i had given birth in the toilet at work			2
' the premature baby was taken to hospital where her development was monitored , and thankfully , she was discharged from hospital after just eight weeks - four weeks before her due date			2
she woke up and did n't feel quite herself but did n't think much of it , so went to work as usual @entity6 and baby april were taken by ambulance to @entity12 @entity6 had started the day in july just like any other , and went to work at @entity24 which was celebrating its 25th anniversary			1
she said : ' i woke up and did n't feel quite myself but i did n't think much of it and went to work			0
' i 'd had a scan the day before and everything was fine with the baby so i was n't worried			0
' but when i was having my lunch break with my colleagues i started to feel really uncomfortable			1
' i went to the toilet and knew what was coming			0
i just thought , right , that 's the head			0
' @entity6 called out for her colleagues who called 999 and her husband @entity18			1
with the paramedics on the end of the line , @entity6 delivered her baby in the toilet			1
@entity6 added : ' i could hear the sirens but april just whooshed out with such force her umbilical cord broke			2
' i did n't know what to do i was in such shock			0
' april was on the floor so my manager told me i better pick her up			0
' i scooped her up and we waited for the paramedics			0
' @entity6 and april were taken by ambulance to @entity12 and april went straight into intensive care where eventually @entity18 was able to join them			1

' i was passed on to paramedics but my phone ran out of battery			0
' i frantically packed a bag for @entity6 and called @entity6 's dad using the house phone and he came and picked me up			2
' it was a complete and utter shock as there was no indication she was going to come so early			0
' when i got to the hospital april was already in the intensive care unit and @entity6 had already been checked over			2
' april went straight into intensive care , and two months later the proud parents took her home as april was three months early , doctors had to battle hard to keep her alive			2
she was diagnosed with sleep apnoea and at five weeks old , april gave her parents the fright of their lives			2
@entity18 said : ' she stopped breathing for over 30 seconds			2
it was terrifying and we had talks about possible blood transfusions , but thankfully she pulled through			0
from that day onward , it was full steam ahead and she just got stronger every day			0
' and after a rapid recovery , april shocked her parents again when she was allowed to come home one month before her original due date of october 10			0
@entity18 said : ' we did n't expected her to come home so early but she was doing amazingly well the doctors said they were struggling to find a reason to keep her in any longer			1
' @entity6 added : ' it was more of a shock that she was well enough to bring her home than her unexpected arrival			1
' at hospital you live in a baby bubble so it is so nice to be home to start family life			1
' and coming home was an extra special occasion for @entity6 and @entity18			1
last year , they lost their first born @entity128 who was still born at 32 weeks			0
@entity18 added : ' it was hard having delivered @entity128 that we were unable to bring him home and it was tough having to walk past the suite where he was born every time i went to visit april and @entity6 in hospital			1
' but although there have been difficult times before , we will never forget the little boy we had and the day we brought april home			2
' she had started to feel really uncomfortable when on her lunch break , so popped to the loo @entity6 with baby april ( centre ) , and manager @entity146 ( right ) and deputy manager @entity147 ( left )			1
