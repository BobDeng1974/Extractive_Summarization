by @entity0 published : 06:49 est , 3 december 2013 updated : 10:06 est , 3 december 2013 we may be more accustomed to seeing her posing in figure - hugging dresses , but even @entity4 is n't immune to the colder weather			2
the new mother has been spotted donning an eye - catching bulky furry brown ankle - length coat that resembles a giant teddy bear , on not one but two occasions recently			1
this modern , oversized @entity13 coat is made from a blend of alpaca and mohair - and comes with a hefty price tag of £ 1,560			1
but , as ever , @entity4 is bang on trend with her choice of seasonal outerwear			0
ladies , it 's time to embrace the teddy bear coat			1
staple outerwear : @entity4 loves her teddy bear coat so much she wore it twice and is leading a new winter trend other fashionistas to be joining the trend are former @entity30 @entity29 , @entity31 , who worked a huge , caramel coloured oversized coat by @entity13 over @entity34 , as well as it girl @entity35 , who received a baby blue @entity37 teddy bear coat by emerging designer @entity39 as a gift			1
with many designers this season heading back towards the fashion industry 's ever controversial penchant for fur , an equal number headed in a new and interesting direction with this offering			0
trendsetter : @entity35 received a baby blue @entity37 teddy bear coat by emerging designer @entity39 as a gift @entity53 fur popped up all over the @entity54 , from @entity55 and @entity56 to the super covetable ( or should we say cuddle - able ) collection of furs by @entity60			1
speaking about the new trend , @entity62 of @entity63 said : ' @entity53 coats are the ultimate in cosy , but huge coats have a habit of making the people who wear them look huge too			0
' the wearer needs to remember that this is most definitely a statement coat and the rest of the outfit needs to be pared down and as minimal as possible			2
' @entity4 got it spot on by teaming hers with black clothes , tights and shoes and slicked back hair			0
' @entity80 , nude , camel , grey and deep red work too			0
and do n’t forget to smile … taking yourself too seriously while dressed as a stuffed toy is a very bad look indeed			0
' celebrity stylist , @entity87 , added : ' if you want to rock a hot new trend now the weather is turning cold , try a teddy bear coat			2
' as this look is all about the cosy fabric , pick a style that suits you - belted or tailored coats will work well if your curvy or pear shape while straighter styles suit apples and athletic frames			0
