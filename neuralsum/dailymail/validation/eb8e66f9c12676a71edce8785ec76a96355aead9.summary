@entity1 are chasing down a possible second @entity2 in six years and , instead of the narrative being exclusively about how @entity5 's side will fare in jumping hurdle number four at the @entity7 on saturday , the skipper 's 100th cap for his country is providing a smokescreen for teammates glad of a diversionary topic			1
@entity0 would n't be of a mind to mention his milestone within camp himself			1
but still , as a topic for his comrades to pass the time with during short media sessions , it falls into perfect , anything - but - @entity23 , territory			1
take @entity25 , the @entity27 giant who has become @entity0 's regular second - row sidekick over the past few seasons			1
@entity0 is preparing for his 100th cap for his country at the @entity7 on saturday @entity5 are chasing down a possible second @entity2 in six years at the @entity7 ask about the general mechanics of the @entity34 lineout and the response is brief			1
' i do n't want to give anything away about lineout strategies , ' he says			0
enquire about the centurion , though , and there 's , eventually , much greater pep to his patter			2
' there 's not much more to be said that has n't already been said about @entity47			2
he 's a world - class player and i do n't think i 'd be the player i am today without having played with him			2
' i 've learned so much from all the second rows i 've played with , especially @entity51 and @entity0			1
he 's a massive leader in the squad , just a massive player on the pitch and players look up to him , ' says @entity25 , who admits to closely watching @entity0 's ruck clear - outs as something he 'd like to replicate			1
@entity0 gets angry during the @entity1 training session at @entity59 in @entity60 , @entity61 ' just to get to 100 caps is a huge testament to how he has looked after himself and to play at the top level for that long ( since his debut against @entity23 in 2002 ) is unbelievable			1
' it was more intimidating playing against him for the first time because i did n't really fancy it to be honest , ' continues @entity25 , adding that this provincial level fear has eroded now that they are test colleagues			0
' he would n't be in my head now … but he 's kind of like @entity5 ( @entity5 ) in that you need to know your detail or he gets on top of you			1
that 's a hugely good thing			2
' more players should be doing it			0
he has driven standards along with @entity5 … the two of them just drive the squad			1
you do n't want to disappoint either of them			0
' @entity85 is another not shy about chipping in his tuppence - worth about the @entity1 captain who lifted the @entity89 trophy in @entity90 last year			1
@entity91 on the loose ball ahead of @entity25 and @entity93 during the @entity89 @entity0 looks on after his teams victory during the @entity89 match between @entity61 and @entity97 ' he has always led from the front			1
he might look a bit mad from the sidelines but he has always got this calm head			0
if things are going south , @entity47 is a good man to bring everything back under check , ' says the veteran tighthead about his fellow 35 - year - old			0
' when he was playing for @entity108 , i was over in @entity109 playing @entity110 or something like that			0
the first time i came into contact with him was at a @entity108 under 20s training session			0
he has always stood out , ' recalls @entity85			0
' i remember watching him take the park for a pre-season friendly , coming on for @entity118			0
he was an impressive physical specimen even then			0
' then he makes his debut against @entity23 and scores a try that he does n't remember ( due to concussion )			2
@entity1 captain @entity0 during the @entity1 training session at @entity59 in @entity60 , @entity61 ' he has always made an impression whenever he gets the chance			1
it 's a testament to the career he has had and the esteem in which he is held that he will now get his 100th cap			1
' he 's always looking for more at training sessions			2
' he was questioning me this week on what bind feels best in a particular scrum			0
even now he 's still looking for new things			2
' the @entity0 theme done and dusted , it 's on to the more serious business at hand - successfully defending the championship			1
this time last year , @entity1 were picking up the pieces following their lost @entity143 match at @entity144 which left them gunning for just the @entity89 title			2
@entity148 's prop @entity147 is tackled by @entity25 during the @entity89 clash at the @entity150 however , while they now still have everything to play for after three championship wins stretched their overall unbeaten run to a record equalling 10 matches , @entity25 does n't feel there is a different dynamic to 2015 's round four preparations - even though ' @entity2 ' is the phrase on every @entity1 supporter 's lips			1
' i do n't think there is much difference			0
if we look at it now , it 's semifinal and final time , so we are in a good place			2
' it 's similar to last year			0
if we win the two games , we win the championship and the @entity2 , ' says @entity25 , adding that the growing hype outside their secluded @entity174 base is largely passing him by , save for last sunday 's visit to his old @entity178 stomping ground			1
' i do n't really read the newspaper or see much that goes on			0
obviously people want to talk about it but i 'm just naturally relaxed about it			0
it does n't really faze me			0
' i do n't really get hyped up at all			0
