by @entity0 it looks more like something from a high - tech electronics factory than a hospital - but this Â£ 2million ' robot surgeon ' is now saving the lives of cancer patients in @entity8			1
the so - called @entity10 robot is an extremely precise surgical tool which is being used to perform operations in a hospital in @entity14			1
the four - armed machine is operated by a surgeon in a special booth in the @entity4 's operating theatre and allows them to work with greater precision			2
the robot 's arms go inside the patient during operations , while a surgeon uses a @entity34 viewfinder , which magnifies the patient 's internal organs			1
@entity53 , consultant urologist and associate medical director at the @entity4 , told @entity14 's @entity55 : ' we can now get into areas which were previously inaccessible to the human hand			0
' he added : ' it gets into the mouth , the tongue , the rib cage , where previously a surgeon simply could not move to work			0
' @entity66 , @entity10 co-ordinator at @entity14 's @entity4 , says the machine is allowing surgeons to go ' to places we could n't get to before ' unlike human surgeons , the robot does n't get tired and so can perform up to 400 operations a year the robot 's tools are used for up to 10 operations before they are replaced and the robot can carry out up to 400 procedures every year			1
experts say the machines reduce the risk of complications during and after surgery			0
@entity66 , @entity10 co-ordinator at the @entity85 , told the @entity86 : ' you can rotate the instruments 360 degress , so they are more dextrous than the human hand			0
' the robots in @entity14 are among 42 around the @entity8 and it is thought the machines ' use could spread in the future .			2
