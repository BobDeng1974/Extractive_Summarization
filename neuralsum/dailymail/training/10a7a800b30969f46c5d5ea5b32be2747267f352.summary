choosing to get up on stage to tell jokes for a living while battling anxiety would be the job from hell for most people but not for @entity8 - she sees it as a gift			1
‘ i really love being on stage - it ’s a lot of fun making people laugh it ’s a really good job , ’ she said			2
‘ sometimes i was just performing for my life thinking “ i ’ve just got to get through this ” but now i ’ve got a dream job – sometimes they do n’t laugh at me but that ’s alright			0
’ working as a comedian has n’t always been enjoyable for the 34 - year - old , who spends half her time in @entity23 and the other half at home in @entity26 , she had to hit rock bottom before climbing her way back to the top again			1
then slowly but surely anxiety began to creep into her life until three years ago when she turned 30 and her life began to spiral completely out of control almost ending her award - winning career			1
‘ i had this other heckler in my head talking incessantly telling me that i ’m a piece of sh * * and that i should get off stage , and that i ’m going to wet myself , and that these people hate me , and i should just leave , ’ she said			2
‘ i would always be drawn to the green exit light in every venue , so i had to not look at that or the little voice in my head would say " get off stage - run through that door " so that was happening for 15 minutes of an hour - long show for months			0

she has also learnt that regular sleep and exercise is vital for her frame of mind			0
‘ seeing a therapist was nothing short of a miracle from how bad it was to how good it got so quickly with her , ’ she said			0
‘ i think the biggest fear is that if you go to see one it is validating that you are insane but the thing is it ’s fine to have a mental illness			0
’ ‘ one in five @entity26 had a mental illness in the last 12 months – that ’s 20 per cent of our country – that ’s a national emergency			2
’ she has learnt to embrace her mental health and to manage it through regular sleep and exercise			0
she also feels privileged that she had chosen a job that gives her the platform to speak candidly about her condition			0
