by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:04 est , 5 march 2013 updated : 02:44 est , 6 march 2013 the head of the health service pleaded ignorance yesterday to damning evidence that patients were failed on his watch			1
as he again faced down calls to quit his post , sir @entity8 was accused of presiding over of a ‘ see no evil , hear no evil ’ culture in the @entity12			1
this , the chief executive admitted , culminated in patients ‘ not being at the centre of the way the @entity12 operated ’			2
he insisted he remains the ‘ right person ’ to stay on and improve the service at a time when it is at ‘ maximum risk ’ owing to impending reform			1
he : admitted he had ‘ no idea ’ about the unfolding scandal at @entity43 where 1,200 patients needlessly died – even though he was in charge of the regional health watchdog ; claimed he had ‘ no access ’ to statistics revealing high death rates while he was running the local health authority , although records show they were viewed online by his colleagues ; appeared unaware of the full extent of gagging orders against staff , saying he would never ‘ sanction ’ such a deal , even though nearly 600 were agreed on his watch ; confessed he did not even read a series of critical reports written on the @entity12 by @entity59 ’s @entity58 – even though they were commissioned during his time in charge			1
questioned by the @entity28 , sir @entity8 made the candid but shocking admission that patients were not the main priority in the @entity12 , which had ‘ lost focus ’			1
anger : @entity68 ( centre ) and protesters at @entity71 as sir @entity8 gave evidence inside sir @entity8 insists he is the ' right person ' to stay and improve the service , despite growing calls for him to resign he has faced growing calls to stand down after it became apparent that he failed to intervene while patients were dying of neglect in @entity78 during his spell on a string of @entity82 health authorities			1
but he has clung on to his £ 211,000 - a year job , insisting he is not ‘ ashamed ’ to carry on as the most powerful man in the @entity12			2
yesterday , for the first time , he admitted personal failings which led to more than 1,000 unnecessary deaths between 2005 and 2009			2
however he claimed he had no indication patients were suffering and dying needlessly until it was exposed by regulators			0
‘ i had no idea , ’ he said			2
‘ we did n’t see any of the information that would lead you to believe that there was all of this going on in @entity98			1
as shocking as it is , that is the truth			0
’ protest : campaigners calling for sir @entity8 's resignation held placards outside @entity104 sir @entity8 said there was ‘ no culture of sharing information ’ in the @entity12			1
‘ during that period , across the @entity12 as a whole , patients were not the centre of the way the system operated			0
’ he explained that the @entity12 ‘ lost its focus ’ because managers were busily chasing targets handed down by @entity59			0
sir @entity8 said that for a ‘ whole variety of reasons , not because people were bad but because there were a whole set of changes going on and a whole set of things we were being held accountable for from the centre ’ , an environment was created where the leadership of the @entity12 lost its focus			1
campaign : a @entity133 @entity12 poster shows what they think of sir @entity8 , calling his ' shameful ' and his evidence ' disgraceful ' ‘ i put my hands up to that and i was a part of that , but my learning from that was to make sure it does n’t happen again			1
’ the prime minister has given sir @entity8 his full backing , insisting he is doing a ‘ very good job ’ , but 40 mps have so far signed or lent their support to a motion calling on him to go			1
polls have shown that as many as 90 per cent of healthcare professionals think he must resign			0
but sir @entity8 began the session with a five - and - a - half minute monologue setting out why he should stay			1
@entity155 committee member dr @entity154 , a former gp , said the embattled chief executive appeared to have ‘ powerful friends watching his back ’			0
she said he should not continue in his role after major @entity12 reforms are unveiled next month , as warning signs about the disaster had been ‘ ignored ’			2
she added : ‘ he claimed not to know about the extent of gagging clauses which are silencing @entity12 staff , claimed not to know about the climate of fear that was highlighted in three reports that were suppressed and only came to light because of a @entity171 request			0
‘ and i felt really the whole issue of did he understand about his own role in this , did he understand the anger of patients , that this mortality data was there , and it was ignored			2
’ sir @entity8 said he regretted failing to meet patients and the ‘ legalistic ’ way they were treated			1
on mortality rates showing a high number of unexpected deaths in @entity98 , which apparently failed to reach him , he claimed they were not widely used by trusts			1
in fact these figures , showing the number of deaths at hospitals compared with what was expected , were published annually in national newspapers since 2001 and online since 2005			0
grilling : @entity12 medical director professor sir @entity197 ( right ) , sir @entity8 ( centre ) and @entity195 ( left ) give evidence to a @entity199 professor @entity200 , of @entity201 , @entity202 , who supplied them to health trusts and the @entity205 , said : ‘ staff accessed them thousands of times , although they did not know we were recording it			1
i find it very difficult to believe he was not aware of them			0
’ @entity214 , former head of a health trust in @entity216 who was handed a £ 500,000 gagging order , said yesterday : ‘ i complained to @entity8 personally and lost everything			2
’ dr @entity154 said : ‘ everyone is saying the @entity12 ca n’t survive without @entity8 because he ’s supposed to have this amazing grasp of detail , but it ’s more than a detail if more than a thousand people died in the hospital where you were head of the strategic health authority			1
‘ he did n’t take responsibility for much except not meeting the patients			0
i ’m afraid very disappointed that all of these things were minimised and it was a case of hear no evil see no evil			0
questions : the trio were being asked about the @entity240 scandal , that cost the lives of up to 1,200 people ‘ it was swept under the carpet			2
he ’s determined to stay on and has a lot of powerful friends watching his back			2
’ @entity68 , 51 , who set up the @entity133 the @entity12 campaign group after her mother @entity251 died in @entity98 , said : ‘ we need to get rid of him			1
he is part of the problem , not the solution			0
that man is an absolute disgrace			0
he is desperate to carry on in his job			0
’ @entity260 , mp for @entity261 , some of whose constituents died at @entity78 , said : ‘ if sir @entity8 was the ceo of a private sector company where there were thousands of avoidable deaths , he would n’t be worried about resigning			1
he would be up on corporate manslaughter charges			0
he ’s happy to take the pay but not the responsibility			0
’ sir @entity8 was in charge of the regional health body supervising the @entity98 trust , and later head of the @entity205 , over the four - year period in which up to 1,200 are feared to have died needlessly by @entity276 four former @entity277 have ridden to the defence of sir @entity8 – insisting there is no reason for him to resign			1
@entity281 , @entity282 , @entity283 and @entity284 said there was no evidence he acted wrongly over the @entity98 scandal			1
@entity59 is worried about sir @entity8 ’s fate as many of the decisions for which he has been criticised took place when it was in power			1
it was responsible for the target regime and the ‘ culture of fear ’ behind it that was blamed for managers in @entity78 putting finance before patients			0
@entity281 was the man who introduced the target regime , under which managers were given financial incentives for bringing down waiting times , in his 2000 @entity12 reform plan			0
he also introduced foundation trusts – it was @entity78 ’s desire to gain this elite status which led to the neglect of patient care			0
neither @entity307 nor @entity308 , @entity59 ’s two other health secretaries during the @entity310 years , responded to calls			0
but their four counterparts were vociferous in their support			0
@entity282 said : ‘ i have been appalled by the campaign against @entity8			2
’ @entity283 said : ‘ @entity8 was part of the solution to raising quality in the @entity12 rather than the problem			2
’ @entity284 , now shadow health secretary , said : ‘ the prime minister has said what he wants to say on @entity8 and i think he is right			2
’ mr @entity281 spoke out in favour of sir @entity8 even though he had never worked directly with him			1
he said : ‘ the easiest thing is to always look for the kneejerk response , put a head on a platter and then everything is solved			0
’ below we assess how mr @entity281 , @entity332 , mr @entity283 and mr @entity284 fared themselves when they were in charge of @entity28 .			0
