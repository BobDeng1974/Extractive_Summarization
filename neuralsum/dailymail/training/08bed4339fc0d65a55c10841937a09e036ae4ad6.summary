for large chunks of a @entity3 game that @entity4 pretty much had to win , this place was a ghost town			1
these should be special times , watching the champions at the @entity8 and getting behind their team in the elite level of @entity12 football			1
at times against @entity16 , the atmosphere here was seriously eerie			1
it is not just @entity4 because other stadiums are affected , too			1
the loudest noise at the @entity8 on wednesday came in the form of pre-match fireworks on @entity22 last weekend @entity23 had a pop at @entity26 fans because he felt that complacency had set in after their impressive start to the season on all fronts			1
here , in a @entity3 group game , it felt like the the energy is being sucked out of one of the best stadiums in football			1
city need to revisit the past , to bring back the days when the fans in the @entity40 or @entity41 were some of the most passionate in the country			0
for large chunks of this @entity46 fixture - a game @entity4 really needed to win - this place was felt deserted			1
without any away supporters , banned because @entity16 were found guilty of racial abuse last season , the @entity8 barely got above a murmur			1
to their credit , a band of @entity4 supporters in the lower their of the @entity52 did their bit , but this club needs more			1
you would have thought that the two - for - the - price - of - one offer on tickets would caused a bit more of a stir , but it did n’t make the blind bit of difference			0
in the end , sadly , it was n’t even a sell - out			2
the atmosphere at @entity70 was special , one of the best in the country ... but the @entity8 feels sterile some @entity16 fans made their way into the ground despite being banned for the match the team needs to play their part because they pass for the sake of passing at times			1
@entity81 , when they were coached by @entity83 , got rid of him for that reason			0
supporters want to see drive , passion and enthusiasm , to be on the edge of their seats when @entity91 , @entity92 or @entity93 are on the ball instead @entity96 ’s team is patient for the sake of being patient			0
perhaps @entity23 , who criticised @entity26 supporters for their failure to get behind the team against @entity102 at @entity103 last week , went too far			0
the fans react to the football in front of them and it is hard to get going when @entity4 are so patient in possession			2
these are some of the biggest games in @entity4 ’s history and the club must learn to savour them and create those crackling atmospheres that we associate @entity116 football with			2
it was sterile here , but it is n’t just @entity4			2
the game has changed so much that supporters are being made to wait for what feels like hours on end at times before their teams gets the ball in the box			2
@entity4 conceded an early goal against @entity16 , which did n't help the atmosphere on the night the performance from the @entity4 team affects the way the fans behave , and there was nothing to cheer about that is the modern a game , a disturbing trend that is affecting football fans who grew up with terrace anthems			1
even before kick - off , when they traditionally belt out @entity142 , it was forced and without feeling			0
they need to believe a bit more here			0
the @entity3 trophy is on @entity4 ’s radar after all the expenditure over the past few years under @entity150 and they have to learn to love it			1
these group games , the six - match slog before @entity154 , still throw up some brilliant matches before the draw for the last 16			0
by the end of tuesday night 's game against @entity160 , it felt like @entity162 fans owned the @entity163 at the @entity163 on tuesday evening , @entity162 ’s 3,000 travelling fans crackled into life the moment they pulled a goal back against @entity169 ’s team			0
by the end it felt like they owned the place			0
perhaps it is time to investigate a ‘ singing section ’ , where the fanatics can congregate on matchday to get behind their team from the stands			0
in a few months ’ time this stadium will have another tier attached to the lower tier of the @entity182			0
maybe it is time to make this the @entity4 end			2
without it , this place will soon lose its soul .			0

at times during the 2 - 1 *defeat* , the atmosphere at the @entity8 was eerie
watching your team play in the @entity3 should be special
it feels like the energy is being sucked out ... they could n't even sell out
it is n't a *problem* *exclusive* to @entity4 , it is the same everywhere
