most afternoons i can be found huffing and puffing my way up @entity3 in @entity4 , pushing what feels like the world 's heaviest baby in a buggy			1
the view of the city from the top is spectacular but for a few precious days i swapped it for an even better one - with the magnificent backdrop of the @entity15 @entity14			1
after a two - hour car journey from @entity18 we were greeted at @entity19 - a five - star , family - owned hotel and spa tucked in a valley in the tiny village of @entity25 - with a local speciality : a sweet and comforting hot apple juice			1
@entity28 - a five - star , family - owned hotel and spa is tucked in a valley in the tiny village of @entity25 in the sunshine , the village looked pristine , with pretty wooden chalets stacked against mountain pastures which would have been snow - covered in winter but were now a vivid green			1
the grass was impossibly neat and as i wondered how many cows it must take to maintain , i spotted sit - on mowers weaving up and down the slopes			1
completing the alpine scene was a hefty - looking herd with jangling cowbells			2
having picked out a buggy from the hotel lobby , with map in hand we set off on a mountain walk but took the lazy way up - in a cable car			1
as the cable car lurched , my four month - old daughter @entity53 wobbled in my lap , lip trembling ; looking back down the mountain and up to the peak seemed a long way off			1
i began to doubt my fitness for what was my first post-baby trip away - billed as a @entity65 healthy strolling break			2
i had feared craggy paths at the summit , precariously winding round the mountain , but found gentle , undulating trails			2
there was a restaurant , playground , park and fountain			1
it was as family friendly as the nursery department at @entity78			2
families and groups were starting out or finishing walks , with children in backpacks and buggies , or just jogging alongside their parents , perfectly content without a gadget in sight			0
some were @entity90 walking , others speed hiking			0
would this sort of family outing happen back home ? not likely and what a shame			2
the views were awesome and the air so pure i took in great gulps in the hope it might benefit my @entity4 - worn lungs			2
we could have easily taken a different trail each day of the week			0
@entity28 boasts @entity105 , a stunning @entity106 - starred restaurant , where chef @entity107 uses seasonal vegetables - so no tomatoes in winter at one hilltop restaurant , deckchairs overlooked the spectacular view like a sort of mountain beach , and children played on swings			1
for a different view of the mountains , the larch trail runs through meadows and up into the mountains opposite the hotel			0
it makes for a wonderful outing for energetic children ( and their parents ) and @entity28 has produced a brilliant educational booklet which encourages little ones to look out for flora and fauna , plus answer questions on their surroundings			1
tucked up inside at @entity19 , the rooms were wonderfully warm - all sweet - smelling pine and herringbone fabrics - but come dusk it was far too tempting to resist lighting the wood fire			0
perhaps it was the mountain air , but bedtime passed without a murmur from @entity53 , who was spoilt with a beautifully made - up cot and goodie bag including baby slippers , towelling robe and a cuddly bear			0
adults get treats too - of the culinary variety			0
@entity28 boasts @entity105 , a stunning @entity106 - starred restaurant , where chef @entity107 uses seasonal vegetables ( no tomatoes in winter ) and 90 per cent local produce			1
@entity53 and @entity152 sank into a neat routine : a walk after breakfast , a swim after lunch @entity53 and i sank into a neat routine : a walk after breakfast , a swim after lunch			0
the peace was enough to move me to tears			0
for my daughter to experience so little intrusive sound apart from cockerels , cowbells and church bells was bliss			0
my ideal partner ( apart from my partner ) on the trip would have been my mother			0
the walks here are challenging enough to invigorate but easy enough to be a comfortable , @entity178 - type ramble			0
i began to wonder if @entity53 would grow up craving a life of outdoor activities , of escaping and exploring			0
as a quote from @entity182 painted on the wall of the pool said : ' old age is like everything else - to have success in it you have to start young			0
' getting there @entity28 ( rosalpina.it ) offers double rooms from £ 235 per night including breakfast			1
