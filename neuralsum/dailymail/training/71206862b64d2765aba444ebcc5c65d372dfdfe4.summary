ms @entity0 said : ' during the winter our clothing provides warmth and comfort especially for pugs , bulldogs , @entity57 terriers and other breeds whose bodies are low to the ground			2

' frigid conditions can aggravate dogs whose ears are already raw from rash or infection , so the hats act as a shield to keep the cold from stinging			0
' @entity47 is pug items are handmade from quality acrylic yarns , so they are warm and washable without being itchy			0
' i do n't think that only humans should have the privilege of masquerading each day in clothing			0

' many of my items are inspired by animals , acting as costumes that can transform your pet from a dog into a wild fox or a little piglet			0
' other hats are inspired by history and fashion , such as the iconic aviator helmet or the cabbie cap which resembles old fashioned " newsboy " hats			0
' in my experience , most dogs enjoy dressing up now and then whether it is because they feel comfortable or because they notice the doting attention that they receive from humans when they wear clothing			0
