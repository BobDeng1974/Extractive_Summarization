the level of hate towards @entity2 in this country rocketed to record highs this weekend , with bizarre calls for him to be stripped of the @entity7 captaincy following his red card against @entity9			1
these people making such suggestions must be small children or they have short memories			0
i ca n’t remember them demanding @entity14 to be burned at the stake when he saw red as @entity7 captain			1
@entity14 described himself as a ' psycho ' with ' veins bulging ' as he berated a referee			0
yet @entity2 , according to the critics , is not a @entity7 captain because he shouts at team - mates who make mistakes			1
can you imagine how @entity14 would have torn into that @entity7 defence at @entity28 ? sends a shudder down the spine			2
@entity2 walks off the pitch after being sent off during the match against @entity9 on saturday referee @entity33 shows @entity2 a red card after his foul on @entity36 at @entity37 here ’s the truth : @entity2 is a working class kid who ’s made something of himself , he ’s an achiever , he ’s a success story			1
some ca n’t handle that			0
it could be a class - hate thing , it could be jealousy			0
maybe it ’s because he plays for @entity7			2
whatever the reason , it is clear that @entity2 can break whatever record he wants for his club , he can win all sorts of medals , but the haters are still going to hate him			1
i suspect @entity2 could n’t care less what these people think			2
when he becomes @entity7 ’s record goalscorer he can laugh in everyone ’s face			2
@entity14 is sent off by referee @entity59 during @entity7 's match against @entity61 in august 1995 but @entity2 does care about @entity62 ; given the level of criticism he has received during his international career he could almost be forgiven for walking away form some of the nonsense that ’s been said and written about him			1
but he still craves international football			0
and if he cares what the haters think of him , then there is only one way he can turn them around			2
and that ’s to become the first @entity62 captain to lift a meaningful trophy			1
in @entity78 in 2016 , it will be 50 years since @entity62 won the @entity79			0
we are all such strangers to success for @entity62 it seems unthinkable			0
@entity2 celebrates scoring for @entity62 during the friendly against @entity84 at @entity85 earlier this month @entity2 attends a press conference to announce a new club partnership with @entity88 on monday but for @entity2 to lead @entity62 to @entity90 glory would surely shut his critics up			1
he ’s started his @entity62 captaincy in perfect fashion			0
two games , two wins , no goals conceded			0
as a dedicated @entity62 fan i want the captain of our great country to know i ’m on his side			1
like our @entity7 facebook page .			0
