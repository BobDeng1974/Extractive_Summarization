the @entity5 's only walk - through cake includes jungle creatures including these cheeky cake monkeys one member of the group , @entity124 , 26 , from @entity125 , said : ' i met some of the other girls at the cake shows i attend regularly and we ’ve made friends			1
they needed to replace people in the group to have enough people to take on the workload			0
' they did n’t want just anyone , they wanted people who had talent , and that we are but we all have our strengths so we used that to our advantage			0
' they approached me a few months back so it ’s been hard catching up to everyone but i made bugs leaves , flowers , a tree and two snow leopard cubs			2
' her dung beetles look worthy of a @entity153 and the flowers and branches that they are perched on are equally life - like			1
the individual bakes come together to form an unbelievably realistic and detailed ( and totally edible ! ) jungle , which will be exhibited at @entity158 2014 this weekend while this cut - in - half bug may not look particularly appetizing , it is in fact crafted out of a variety of delicious sweet materials the group of 16 of the most talented bakers across the @entity5 and the @entity166 have created a jungle made entirely of cake which includes realistic @entity169 which do n't look out of place next to real leaves each dung beetle , no more than four inches long , took days to complete , while some of the more complicated items took even longer			1
the display featured at least a dozen beetles			0
cake maker @entity124 has created terrifying creepy crawlies in the middle of the @entity180 , yet each beetle , flower and bug is made entirely out of cake each dung beetle , no more than four inches long , took days to complete , while some of the more complicated items took even longer for the insects she made a chocolate cake mould with edible blood from condensed milk sugar , food colouring and a raspberry chambord liquor with the wings made out of gelatine			1
she also made 100 flowers made including hibiscus and frangipani as well as creating the leopard cubs by sculpting and moulding sponge cake together with jam and buttercream			2
the jungle required the intricate crafting of 100 flowers made from hibiscus and frangipani juggling her job as a ceramic designer with her passion , @entity124 has only been entering baking competitions for 12 months , but still managed to create the stunning design close up pictures revealing the amazing detail put in to even the tiny bugs and beetles for the jungle scene juggling her job as a ceramic designer with her passion , @entity124 has only been entering baking competitions for 12 months			1

disappointed by the plain white cake that arrived which she had ordered , she decided to give put her ceramic skills to good use - and created her own two - part hgv lorry cake			2
@entity223 working on the @entity224 for the jungle scene carefully molding a multi-layered sponge cake into the correct shape she has since competed in some of the @entity229 biggest cake - making competitions such as @entity11 ’s @entity230 where she scooped the gold last year for her brown - and - yellow turtle cake with fondant fins - dedicated to her grandmother , @entity235 , who died last year aged of 91			1

her fast - thinking dad caught the head before it smashed on the floor and even with only half a design she took the silver award and has learned a few tricks along the way			0
@entity124 working on the leopard , which will only be completed on sunday , just in time for the competiton a close up of the leopards leg once it has been painted , resting on edible ' mud ' @entity124 said : ' when i loaded the bulldog cake into the car i noticed that it was slightly cracking so i tried to fill it in but it was getting bigger			0
' when i got to the event and the head came right off and my dad managed to catch it in his hand before it landed on the floor			0
i was absolutely devastated and cried for ages , i was so exhausted and now i would have nothing to show for it			0
