exclusive by @entity1 this is the moment an inventor ’s boyhood dream came to life - when he watched a surfer glide across a lake with a handheld electric jet engine for the first time			1
@entity10 took to the @entity12 lake in @entity13 to test the device - which is capable of helping users travel at up to 50mph , and effectively acts as an alternative to wind			1
watching from dry land last week was 40 - year - old engineer @entity18 , who has spent two years at his garage in @entity20 developing the water - resistant jet engine thrusters			1
‘ that planted in my mind the idea of having some sort of stand propulsion for a board sport			0
years went by and i did paragliding			1
i made this little bar with two engines and it worked			2
‘ so , then i thought let 's make something that you can control the power on			0
it 's just me - i 'm not some big company			2
i spoke with a patent attorney , and we put some drawings together			0
‘ it 's still patent pending			0
i tried it on water quite a while ago using a small bar , but there was n't enough power			0
this is the first time it 's been done on a lake with an expert			2
’ dr @entity18 , who is the founder and director of engineering firm @entity71 , said his technology is still in the early stages , because the device only lasts for ten minutes before the batteries run out			1
it is also quite heavy for users , but dr @entity18 added that he expects technology to have improved so much in five years that the device will be half the weight and double the power			1
diagram : the apparatus ( 10 ) includes first and second air - moving thrusters ( 16 ) arranged at opposite ends of a rigid device ( 1 )			1
the @entity89 arrows show possible rotations of the device , the user is 100 and his connection to the unit is 28			2
the thrusters ' housing is 18 , and the propeller is 24 explained : another diagram of the device , seen from the front this time , which is two years in the making			1
the numbers in the above caption correspond to the same parts in this image at the moment , the developers are using several battery packs for testing the device , but it can then be recharged either with a generator or by plugging it back in			2
dr @entity18 added that one of the device ’s major benefits is that the air coming out of it is cold , and that it can handle impact with water - but he is working on a fully - waterproof version			1
‘ it 's safe because it 's cold , ’ he said			0
‘ and if you crash you 've something to land on			0
’ dr @entity18 's aim now is to see the device - which he expects to come with a retail price of £ 3,000 to £ 6,000 once it is commercially released - used by a team of athletes in a competitive event			1
mr @entity10 , an experienced windsurfer and snowboarder , told @entity43 : ‘ the hard thing to begin with was how heavy it is , but once you ’ve got enough thrust going it takes its own weight			1
‘ initially it 's pretty awkward to balance until you come up to speed			0
it 's very experimental , and we 're really excited about what other things to do with it			0
’ he added : ‘ i only had it half throttle , and it was 25mph - from a windsufing point of view , that 's an average speed that most competent windsurfers can get to on a good day			2
development : @entity18 , 40 , has spent two years developing the water - resistant jet engine thruster smiles : mr @entity10 ( right ) watches back his jet engine surfing attempt on the @entity12 lake in @entity13 ‘ as you accelerate harder , the bar that you 're holding wants to take off , so unless you can keep your arms steady , your arms gradually raise up in the arm and the thrust is then pushing you down rather than along			1
so you 're performing a balancing act			0
’ dr @entity18 said of seeing the device in action on the water : ‘ it took me back to when i was a kid with my model aircraft engine , just having a go			1
we sometimes forget that we can have a bit of fun			0
’ ' the physics of it are quite spectacular , to get enough power to do what the wind does ' @entity18 , inventor dr @entity18 said he was also proud of achieving what he had mocked up in a concept image on @entity177 two years ago - and that the thruster could also be used for snowboarding			1
he added : ‘ the physics of it are quite spectacular , to get enough power to do what the wind does			2
a snowboard , skateboard - anything you want to jump on - this is your power - kite			0
’ and he said of his four - year - old daughter : ‘ she thinks it 's normal for people to have a set of thrusters - because she has n't seen any other			0
there are two kids in my house - me and my daughter			0

@entity10 took to @entity12 lake in @entity13 to test new device
it can travel at up to 50mph and effectively acts as an alternative to wind
@entity18 , 40 , has spent two years developing it in @entity207 - on - @entity208
but technology is still in early stages and device only lasts for ten minutes
model has *78* *%* energy *efficiency* with four 10hpw engines at *30,000rpm*
