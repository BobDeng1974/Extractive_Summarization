ordeal : @entity1 , 28 , was left with brain damage after hitting her head on the road during a row with a taxi driver in 2009 a mother - of - two has spoken of her dreadful ordeal after a row over a Â£ 4.40 taxi fare ended with her lying in a coma for a month with brain damage			1
@entity1 , 28 , was forced to have a section of her skull removed after smashing her head on the road outside her home in @entity17 following @entity19 celebrations in 2009			1
she claims she had got out of the taxi to fetch cash from her house but was still next to the vehicle when the driver suddenly lurched forward in the car - causing her to fall over			1
after smashing her head on the ground , she was left with brain damage and spent more than a month in an induced coma as medics desperately fought to save her life			1
the taxi driver , who says ms @entity1 had threatened to run off without paying before their row began , claims he moved the car forward because he ' feared for his safety ' - and insists he made no contact with the mother			1
he was never prosecuted but a high court judge later allowed her to pursue a civil claim for damages			1
she won the civil case and is now set to receive a payout			1
ms @entity1 , mother to @entity44 , eight , and @entity45 , said : ' before the accident , i was hoping to get a job as a nurse and be able to buy a nice house and car			1
all that has been taken away from me			0
' i feel incredibly lucky to be alive			0
there was a point when i thought i 'd never see my kids again			2
' every day i spend with them now feels extra precious			0
it 's affected my life in every way			0
' ms @entity1 , who was 21 at the time of the crash , was airlifted to @entity63 at around 1.40am on march 18 , 2009			1
over the next five days she had part of her skull removed and a string of operations to alleviate the pressure on her brain			2
her family kept a bedside vigil as she staged a remarkable recovery			0
she was released four months later but suffered epileptic seizures at her home			2
medics later intricately moulded a titanium plate on to her skull			0
hospital battle : the mother - of - two spent a month in an induced coma as medics fought to save her life in the @entity84 hearing , held in @entity17 to determine whether ms @entity1 could launch civil proceedings against the cab driver , he claimed she had hurled drunken abuse at him and said she was trying to dodge the fare			1
he said he had driven forward because he ' feared for his safety ' - but he refused to accept his car had touched her before she fell to the floor			1
however , judge @entity92 dismissed the account as ' inconceivable ' in a hearing to determine liability for the incident			0
a further court date will be set to assess what damages to be awarded			1
in a written ruling , judge @entity92 said that ' probably no one will ever know ' why the taxi was moved forward			2
the judge wrote : ' it is possible that the movement was accidental but i make no finding to that effect			0
' i am , however , satisfied that he did move the taxi forward and to the right at a time when he knew that the claimant was close to the front offside of the taxi			2
' he plainly did not take reasonable care for her safety			0
' permanent reminder : ms @entity1 was left with a massive scar on her head after surgeons were forced to remove a section of her skull in an emergency procedure to relieve pressure to her brain ms @entity1 now suffers from memory loss , a string of mental conditions and often finds it difficult to go out			1
she is undergoing a process of rehabilitation and often relies on support workers to help her			0
she added : ' everyone is really proud of how far i 've come and how i 've improved			0
' it could have been so different			0
i ca n't really complain about things because it could have been a lot worse			0
' @entity140 , a partner in the serious injury team at @entity143 solicitors who has represented , said : ' @entity1 sustained life - threatening and life - changing injuries in the accident and she and her family have been through a real ordeal as she has battled not only to seek justice but also to return to health			2
' i am naturally delighted by @entity1 's court victory but i am even more pleased that she will now have access to the rehabilitation and help that she will need to overcome the difficulties that she has been left with as a result of her dreadful injuries			1
requires care : the 28 - year - old now suffers from memory loss , a string of mental conditions and often finds it difficult to go out ' @entity1 and her family deserve the chance to try to get back to how things were before the accident and i am really pleased that her court victory will now give her the funds which will give her the opportunity to do so			1
' a @entity170 spokeswoman said the case was now a civil matter			2
a spokesman for the @entity174 said : ' in order to bring criminal charges in any case , there must be sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction			0
' during the course of the investigation , significant doubts emerged about the credibility of key eyewitness accounts			0
' this made it impossible to establish the exact sequence of events beyond any reasonable doubt			0
as a result , no criminal charges could be brought against the driver of the vehicle			2
