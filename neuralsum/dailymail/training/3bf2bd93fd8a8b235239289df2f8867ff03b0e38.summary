he told the @entity27 : ‘ it is absolutely terrible the way television is chopped into so many little bits			1
the story has to be designed to work around that			2
so you have 18 minutes for your first part , 15 minutes for your second part and the last parts are only ten minutes each			2
‘ your story is cut down into little wedges , so you have to be sure that each wedge , each section , satisfies the audience and they keep coming back from the commercial break			2
that requires really careful planning			2
’ mr @entity7 began writing for @entity47 in the 1980s and penned several @entity49 stories and the first 14 episodes of detective series @entity21 , which is known for dispatching its characters in grisly and inventive ways			1

after 14 episodes i realised there was no one left in @entity21			0
