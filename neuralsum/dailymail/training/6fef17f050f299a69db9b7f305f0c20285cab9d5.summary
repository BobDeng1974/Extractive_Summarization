by @entity0 ordeal : @entity2 was abused by a friend of the family a mother was shocked and horrified to discover her three - year - old daughter had been molested by a friend of the family			1
now she 's urging other parents to broach the subject of sexual abuse with young children to ensure they are safe and aware of what 's right and wrong			1
@entity15 was stunned when her little girl , @entity2 , ( names have been changed to protect their identities ) , casually revealed that her private parts had been touched by @entity20			1
he was a trusted friend of the family who @entity15 had no reason to suspect was a child abuser			1
she had only raised the issue of sexual abuse with @entity2 after hearing about the @entity28 's pants campaign - which advises parents to ensure their children know they should not be touched beneath their underwear			1
@entity15 explains : ' i had n't thought about talking to @entity2 about abuse before as she was only three - years - old and i did n't think that it would be something that would happen to us			1
not long after hearing about the @entity28 's @entity36 , i was putting some cream on her where her pants had rubbed and thought it would be the perfect opportunity to talk to her			1
' i said : " where your pants cover ; that area is for you			2
no - one else can touch this area			2
" i expected her to just say ok but she said " @entity20 puts his fingers up there			1
" ' jailed : @entity20 was found guilty of four counts of sexually abusing the girl in disbelief , @entity15 and her husband , @entity50 ( not his real name ) , then asked @entity2 to tell them more about what @entity20 had @entity56 couple had known @entity20 for ten years but had never been aware he had been alone with their daughter when he had visited their home			1
@entity15 said : ' i felt so betrayed and i was in a state			1
we did n't think something like this could ever happen to her ; we had n't even left him completely alone with her			0
we saw @entity20 and his wife a lot and , from what @entity2 told us , he had used every opportunity he could when he got a few minutes alone with her to abuse her			1
they played hide and seek a lot and she told me that he always told her to hide in the bedroom and he did it then			0
she said he did it " lots and lots and lots " of times			0
' the parents called the police and praised the way they gently spoke to @entity2 about what had happened to her before taking their investigation further			1
@entity15 recalls : ' everything was taken at @entity2 's pace and i ca n't fault the police at all for how they handled it			1
i agreed that @entity2 could have a medical examination and the damage was consistent to what she had told us had happened			1
' by now she knew that what had happened to her was wrong and she knew that she had to talk to the police about it so that @entity20 would be punished for what he did			1
' she said : " do i have to tell them everything that he did to me so that he is told off ? " i told her that she did and i was shocked when she said he touched her elsewhere too			1
' she added that she was sickened to learn @entity20 had been telling @entity2 she was his ' special little princess '			1
@entity20 , 60 , of @entity100 , @entity101 , was arrested and charged with four counts of sexually abusing the girl			1
he denied he had done anything wrong so the family had to go through the ordeal of giving evidence at his trial			0
it 's good to talk : @entity15 is urging other parents to broach the underwear rule with their children ( posed by models ) @entity15 was a witness and @entity2 gave her statement via a video link			1
@entity15 said she was proud of how bravely her little girl handled the intimidating situation			2
she said : ' we told @entity2 that it had to go to court as she said it happened and @entity20 said it had n’t and she understood that			1
i was initially concerned about her having to give evidence via video link but they did everything to ease my worries and to make the experience as comfortable for @entity2 as possible			2
' @entity50 and i were shown around the court first and were able to ask questions about the process			0
we were then able to take @entity2 so that she could get used to the courthouse and could learn about what would happen			2
@entity136 is for ... privates are @entity138 to your child that no one should ask to see or touch their private parts			0
sometimes doctors , nurses or family members might have to			0
explain that this is ok , but that those people should always explain why , and ask your child if it 's ok @entity150 is for ... always remember your body belongs to youlet your child know their body belongs to them , and no one else			0
no one has the right to make them do anything that makes them feel uncomfortable			0
and if anyone tries , tell your child they have the right to say @entity164 is for ... no means nomake sure your child understands that they have the right to say " no " to unwanted touch - even to a family member or someone they know or @entity172 is for ... talk about secrets that upset @entity174 the differences between " good " and " bad " secrets			2
phrases like " it 's our little secret " are an abuser 's way of making a child feel worried , or scared to tell someone what is happening to them			0
good secrets can be things like surprise parties or presents for other people			0
bad secrets make you feel sad , worried or @entity192 is for ... speak up , someone can helptell your child that if they ever feel sad , anxious or frightened they should talk to an adult they trust			0
this does n't have to be a family member			0
it can also be a teacher or a friend 's parent - @entity201			0
' she gave evidence for nearly an hour as she kept talking and talking			0
i think they underestimated what they would get from her but she is a very smart , switched on little girl so she kept coming out with things			0
' even though she was young , i knew from her personality that she was more than able to do it			0
it was still horrible waiting for it to finish though and i could n’t see her after as i was a witness so she went and had dinner with her dad			0
but @entity50 said she could n’t eat anything and was upset by the ordeal			0
' @entity20 was found guilty of all four counts of sexual abuse and jailed for eight years			1
@entity15 said : ' we were relieved that they came back and found him guilty the same day			2
he was sentenced to eight years in prison			0
we told @entity2 and she said " see , i told everyone i was n't lying			2
" ' @entity15 said @entity2 was clingy for a time after the trial and did n't like being left alone			1
but as time goes on , her mother said she is regaining her confidence			0
now @entity15 is urging other parents to talk to their children about the @entity36 , explained in our pink box out			1
she said : ' i know a lot of parents might be worried about having the conversation with their children but it 's so important that you do			2
i do n't want this to happen to anyone else			0
' you do n't think that sexual abuse will ever effect your family but it could do so you need to talk to your children about it to protect them			2
there are so many opportunities when you can bring it up , such as when you are washing them or dressing them			0
' you do n't have to make it into a big thing ; you can talk to them as though it 's an everyday conversation			0
you can just tell them that what is under their pants belongs to them and no - one else should touch it and that if anything worries them they should tell you and not keep it a secret			2
' if i had n't have heard about the @entity36 i do n't think i would have had that conversation with @entity2 and the abuse could have progressed and then things could have got a lot worse			2
