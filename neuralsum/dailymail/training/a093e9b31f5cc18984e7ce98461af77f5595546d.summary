@entity8 , 46 , from @entity9 , had gained weight after suffering years of abuse from her mother 's partner and then married a violent man			1
in a bid to make herself less attractive to men , @entity8 overate so her weigh rose to 21st 7lbs at her heaviest			1
she explained : ' it happened repeatedly over two years and i felt dirty and disgusted			0

however this security did n't last long and he soon became physically abusive			0

it was n't until he pushed her down the stairs whilst pregnant with their child @entity52 , now 28 , that she made the decision to escape			0
