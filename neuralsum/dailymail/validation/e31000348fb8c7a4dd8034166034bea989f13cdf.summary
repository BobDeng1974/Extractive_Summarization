@entity0 has been told it would be ‘ completely disrespectful ’ to ride part of the @entity4 route this summer by the head of world cycling			1
as revealed by the @entity7 , @entity0 has agreed to a request by former @entity10 footballer and fellow cancer survivor @entity11 to join him in raising money this summer in the battle against the deadly disease			1
@entity11 and a team of cyclists will ride the @entity4 route one day ahead of the professional peloton and he travelled to @entity19 last month to persuade the controversial @entity20 to support the event for two stages			1
but the initiative has divided opinion in cycling , with sir @entity26 suggesting @entity0 has already ‘ done enough damage ’ and @entity28 president @entity27 also urging the man stripped of his seven @entity4 titles for doping to stay away from @entity31 this summer			1
@entity0 ( left ) will join @entity11 's @entity34 charity ride of the @entity4 course @entity0 back on the @entity4 circuit as @entity11 persuades disgraced former winner to ride stages ahead of peloton for cancer charity speaking at an event in @entity42 on tuesday , @entity27 said @entity0 ‘ would be well - advised not to take part ’ in the an event hoping to raise £ 1million for blood cancer			1
‘ i 'm sure that @entity11 means well , but frankly i think that 's completely inappropriate and disrespectful to the @entity4 , disrespectful to the current riders , and disrespectful to the @entity28 and the anti-doping community , ’ said @entity27			1
‘ i think @entity0 would be well - advised not to take part in that			2
’ only a week after the @entity52 report into cycling doping – ordered by @entity27 – revealed that the use of banned substances is still a major problem in the sport , some might question whether professional cycling should even concern itself with a charity bike ride			1
the disgraced rider , who was stripped of his seven @entity4 title , wants to return to work fighting cancer @entity11 is set to undertake a charity ride there are convicted dopers currently running pro tour teams and right now the @entity28 is considering revoking the race licence of the @entity70 team that boasts last year ’s tour winner , @entity72 , but has seen five of its riders test positive in recent months			1
it ’s team manager , @entity77 , is a convicted doper while questions continue at @entity80 over whether their employment of sporting director @entity82 represents a challenge to their zero tolerance policy			0
@entity86 , the head of the @entity20 anti-doping agency whose investigation ultimately brought down @entity0 , had no great objection to him rejoining the cancer battle			2
‘ as long as it 's not a sanctioned competition that falls under the rules , it 's not a direct concern , ’ said @entity86 , who only last week said he now feels ‘ sorry ’ for @entity0 and other riders in the light of the @entity52 report into the doping culture in cycling and is now prepared to discuss reducing the @entity20 ’s life ban from sport			2
‘ that 's outside the technical rules			0
’ @entity105 , the @entity4 race director , also did not object to @entity0 ’s involvement , making the point that he e would riding on public roads			2
@entity27 , meanwhile , challenged the charity argument			0
‘ i 've heard that reason rolled out throughout @entity113 's career as well , ’ he said			0
‘ i 'm not critical of people trying to raise funds for charity , let 's be clear			0
‘ but i think maybe @entity0 could find a better way of continuing his fundraising efforts than this			0
@entity0 can ride his bike around @entity31 as often as he likes , it 's got nothing to do with me or the @entity28			2
’ @entity0 has been criticised by cycling boss @entity27 for taking part in the charity ride @entity27 , president of the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) , says @entity0 would be best advised not to take part in the charity ride @entity11 responded with a statement , making it clear it is a fundraising issue and not a cycling issue			1
the statement said : ‘ when i was being treated for blood cancer i was inspired by @entity0 ’s book “ it ’s not about the bike , my journey back to life ”			0
it gave me strength to deal with my predicament and a purpose which crystallised into the 2005 charity ride along the route of the @entity4			2
whatever @entity0 has done since , and i have gone on record condemning his use of performance enhancing drugs , this does n’t remove the importance that he played at that critical period of my life			0
' we have stayed in touch intermittently – he presented me with the @entity155 at the @entity156 in 2005 – and have had occasional chats over the last year about how he might support my charity endeavours			0
i went to see him a few weeks ago at his home in @entity19 and he genuinely wants to help improve the situation of those with blood cancer			0
' we are still confirming details of how @entity0 will support @entity4 – one day ahead but it is likely to involve him riding a couple of stages and hosting a training camp for the team			1
i understand that some people will find it hard to accept @entity0 ’s support but my take is a simple one : if @entity0 ’s involvement in @entity174 and my goal to raise £ 1 million for blood cancer can help save one more life then surely that can only be a good thing			0
’ @entity0 issued a statement , saying : ‘ i 'm honoured and humbled to have been invited by legendary footballer and fellow cancer survivor @entity11 to accompany him on parts of his ride around @entity31			1
‘ since my own diagnosis , i 've been 100 percent committed to fighting this dreadful disease that affects millions , and that holds true today			0

@entity0 will ride the route of one day of the @entity4 for *chairty*
@entity0 was asked by former footballer @entity11 to take part
cycling boss @entity27 does not believe @entity0 should take part
