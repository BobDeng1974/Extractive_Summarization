astronomers have witnessed a supermassive black hole attempting to eat a star by stretching it into a ' noodle shape '			1
while scientists have seen black holes swallow stars before , this one is special rare because it 's not going down easy			0
in fact , the black hole is ' choking ' on the star located three billion light years away because its enormous gravity is pulling down hard on one side of stellar body			1
with a magnitude of -22.5 , this event was as bright as the ' superluminous supernovae ' - a new category of the brightest stellar explosions known			0
the team nicknamed the 2009 event ' @entity36 , ' after a character in the cartoon @entity39 and thought he might be a supernova			0
' when we discovered this new object , it looked similar to supernovae we had known already , ' said lead author @entity44 of the @entity45 in @entity46			0
' but when we kept monitoring its light variation , we realised that this was something nobody really saw before			0
the giant black hole at the center of the @entity54 may be producing mysterious particles called neutrinos , researchers believe			1
if confirmed , this would be the first time that scientists have traced neutrinos back to a black hole			1
researchers say the find could help explain how cosmic rays are produced , and solve a key mystery about how the universe operates			0
the evidence came from three @entity68 satellites that observe in x-ray light : the @entity70 , the @entity72 gamma - ray mission , and the @entity73 ( @entity73 )			0
' figuring out where high - energy neutrinos come from is one of the biggest problems in astrophysics today , ' said @entity79 of the @entity80 in @entity81 , who co-authored a study about these results published in @entity84 ' we now have the first evidence that an astronomical source – the @entity54 's supermassive black hole – may be producing these very energetic neutrinos			1
' ' finding out that it was probably a supermassive black hole eating a star was a fascinating experience			1
team member @entity93 , leader of the supernova group at the @entity95 said : ' we got the idea that it might be a ' tidal disruption ' event			0
' this means that the enormous gravity of a black hole pulls on one side of the star harder than the other side , creating tides that rip the star apart			1
' a star wanders near a black hole , the star 's side nearer the black hole is pulled ' on more than the star 's far side , he said			1
' these especially large tides can be strong enough that you pull the star out into a noodle ' shape			0
@entity112 ' does n't fall directly into the black hole , ' @entity93 said			2
' it might form a disk first			0
but the black hole is destined to swallow most of that material			2
' based on the characteristics of the light from @entity36 , and their deductions of the star 's original mass , the team has determined that @entity36 started out as a @entity128 - like star , before being ripped apart			2
their observations of the host galaxy , coupled with @entity36 's behaviour , led them to conclude that the galaxy 's central black hole has the ' rather modest ' mass of about a million suns , @entity93 said			2
delving into @entity36 's behaviour has unexpectedly resulted in learning more about small , distant galaxies , @entity93 said , ' who knew this little guy had a black hole ? ' the black hole was seen ' choking ' on the star located three billion light years away because its enormous gravity is pulling down hard on one side of stellar body			1

the black hole tried to eat a star located three billion light years away
but astronomers noticed it ' choking ' on the star because its enormous gravity was pulling down hard on just one side of stellar body
the discovery was made at the @entity27 in @entity28
