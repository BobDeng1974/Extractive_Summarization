by @entity0 a mother has criticised the @entity2 and its photo rules after it took her five hours to get a useable snap of her newborn baby for his passport			2
six - week - old @entity8 is due to fly with parents @entity9 and @entity11 to @entity12 , @entity13 , in august			1
but miss @entity9 , 29 , from @entity14 , @entity15 , wishes she picked a holiday in @entity17 after the passport photo session with a professional photographer turned into an all - afternoon marathon			1
the ones that did n't work : @entity8 tries his best at the marathon photo shoot			2
rules state that babies must look directly into the camera with a straight face , both ears must be visible and no one else can be in the frame strict rules on passport pictures mean the subject has to be looking directly at the camera with a straight face , both ears visible and no - one else in the frame			1
miss @entity9 said : ' my hands could n’t be in it at all			2
i was holding him at the waist and i was scared that his neck was getting sore			0
' i think the rules are ridiculous			0
' what the family hoped would be a 15 - minute photo shoot turned into an endurance test that stretched from midday to 5pm before they finally got a suitable image			2
that 's the one ! after five hours , @entity8 took a photo that passed the @entity2 's rules			1
the application form and precious photo have joined a queue of nearly 500,000 in the backlog mrs @entity9 , a company administrator , said @entity8 remained calm , but admitted : ' i was stressed and i was getting upset			1
' she added : ' the passport lasts five years			0
how do you expect strangers to identify babies from photos , that in a couple of years , they wo n’t look anything like ? ' i am trying to plan something that is meant to be exciting and fun , but this has put a bit of a dampener on things			0
' family holiday : @entity9 and her fiance @entity11 are planning to take their six - month - son @entity72 on a to @entity12 , @entity13 in august			1
miss @entity9 called the passport rules ' ridiculous ' and ' constraining ' the family paid a £ 90 fee for @entity8 ’ passport but the photographer is a family friend who gave his time for free			1
to add insult to injury , the application form and precious photo have joined a queue of nearly 500,000 passports in the backlog			0
' it was so difficult , ' said miss @entity9			0
' but i ’m not the first and i certainly wo n’t be the last parent to struggle with this			0
' i just hope his passport comes on time			0

@entity9 needed to take a photo of six - week - old son @entity8
but rules require infants to be looking straight into the camera
she struggled to hold her son without her hands getting in the way
