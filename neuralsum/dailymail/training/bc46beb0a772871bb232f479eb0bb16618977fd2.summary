@entity6 forward @entity1 was again the @entity7 ' talisman against @entity8 on sunday , scoring twice and setting up the opener in the 3 - 0 victory which moved @entity12 's side to within a point of fourth - placed @entity14			1
the work - rate of the @entity16 has been impressive since completing a Â£ 32million summer move from @entity18 , and @entity19 international @entity5 revealed the rest of the squad are determined not to let their own high standards slip			1
@entity1 celebrates after scoring his second goal in @entity3 's 3 - 0 defeat of @entity8 the @entity26 has been in sensational form since arriving from @entity18 - scoring 12 goals in 19 league games ' when you see someone working hard from the front and maybe if they close three players down and do n't win the ball back , then you are not there to back him up , you do have to look at yourself and think ' why was i not there to help my team - mate out ? ' it does set the tone for the rest of the team , ' said @entity5			1
' if the boys up front react quickly when we lose the ball , it brings the midfield with them , full - backs and the defenders to switch from attack to defence			0
it is something that we work hard on			0
' @entity1 does it better than anyone i have seen			2
he has come from @entity18 , and it is a strong philosophy that they play by , so maybe he has picked that up there and brought that to us in every game he has played			2
' there are definitely a lot of boys learning from him			0
' @entity5 ( left ) says the forward 's workrate has made players raise their game at @entity3 victory at the @entity72 saw the @entity7 move to within a point of the top four as well as producing a devastating offensive display , which saw goalkeeper @entity75 make a number of top - class saves , the @entity7 also retained a solid formation , something which had been distinctly lacking when they went down 3 - 2 away at @entity8 in early december			1
@entity5 said : ' that is a quality which every side that finishes up the table needs to have , because you ca n't always play the way you want to play , sometimes you have to roll your sleeves up , be physical and win the duels			2
on sunday , we did that			0
' i definitely think in the game away at @entity8 we lacked that and that is why we came out with a loss			1
' that is always at the back of your mind , so we need to take that approach every game because once we match teams physically and defending-wise , it gives us a good chance			0
' we know in our team we have got the quality going forward to cause teams damage , so it is always important to make sure we match teams physically and do the dirty stuff as well			0
' goalkeeper @entity110 has accepted being dropped with ' great professionalism ' @entity110 's replacement @entity112 kept a clean sheet but had very few saves to make goalkeeper @entity110 was left on the bench against @entity8 , with @entity117 international @entity112 given a @entity119 debut			1
it remains to be seen whether manager @entity12 will recall @entity110 for the trip to @entity122 next week , although it was maintained sunday 's decision was not based on any disciplinary action in the wake of negative headlines over the @entity128 international smoking in the showers following the defeat at @entity131			1
@entity5 felt the 24 - year - old had handled the situation with great professionalism			2
he said : ' i have n't seen any difference in @entity136			0
he is always a big part of our squad			0
he is always a character around the dressing room and he has been no different this week			0
