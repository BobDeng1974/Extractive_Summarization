@entity0 shuffled a little too far across to the off side , stayed fatally a little too far back and saw a gentle delivery from @entity3 flick his thigh pad and take the top of leg - stump			1
it was a cruel yet somehow inevitable end to another miserable day for the @entity9 captain			0
if the dismissal of @entity0 came almost in freakish fashion and with more than an element of bad luck then it seemed almost pre-ordained after a last - wicket stand of such frustration for @entity9 that it would have frazzled their captain			1
the last thing @entity0 needed when he is fighting for his captaincy life was a partnership that lasted two and a half hours between two absolute rabbits in @entity23 and @entity24 that sucked all remaining life from @entity9			1
yet once @entity48 , @entity40 average of 3.33 , and @entity24 , without a half - century to his name , started milking the @entity9 attack on a @entity52 wicket that simply got lower and slower then @entity0 ’s misery was destined to continue			1
this was nothing like the woeful captaincy on the fourth day at @entity57 that allowed @entity58 and @entity59 to guide @entity60 to a position from where they were to snatch a series victory at the very last gasp			0
@entity0 had been pro-active with his field placings and bowling changes throughout @entity42 ’s long vigil — almost too funky at times — and the bowlers who had let him down at @entity71 had given their all in anything but home conditions			1
yet that painful stand of 111 , an @entity76 last - wicket record against @entity9 , lifted their team from a below - par 346 for nine to 457 all out and the pressure had built 10-fold on a captain in need of a break			2
@entity0 had only 10 minutes to unscramble his brain and try to get through the 17 overs that remained on this second day of a series that will make or break his leadership			2
as it turned out he could not survive four of them			0
@entity0 , in common with most of @entity9 ’s batsmen , prefers the back foot and @entity92 ’ sub- continental pitch was never going to favour an opener who has not recorded a century in 25 innings and has failed to score more than 50 in 14 innings at @entity52			2
the first ball of the @entity9 innings from @entity24 was floated down at no more than 78 miles per hour and swung in at @entity0 who got an inside edge onto it and guided it for a single on the leg - side			1
nervy but at least he was on his way			0
trudging off : @entity0 walks off at the end of the @entity42 innings tail wagging : @entity3 plays a shot at the end of the @entity42 innings then , in the second over , @entity48 strayed onto @entity0 ’s legs and was punched confidently through square leg for four , his favourite shot perhaps giving him hope that he may just come through the most torrid examination of his mettle			1
it was not to be			0
that was as good as it got for @entity0 who is finding ways of getting out to balls that would never have troubled him when he was scoring each of his 25 test hundreds for @entity9			0
@entity122 has clearly deserted him too			0
as his 10th ball somehow hit the stumps , and the realisation of the extent of his plight dawned on him , this patriotic @entity124 crowd showed their support with a warm , sympathetic round of applause			0
just over a year ago @entity0 seemed destined to break every record in @entity9 ’s run - scoring book , but his professional world has fallen apart since then and he will soon have to decide if he can carry on as both captain and opener			0
there has been nothing wrong with @entity0 ’s leadership in this @entity141 , and he seems to have learned the lessons from @entity71 , but if he is not scoring runs at the top of the order then he is struggling to justify his place at the helm of this side			2
support for @entity0 among his team - mates and the @entity151 is absolute and his position will only be an issue if @entity9 lose this test			0
@entity155 and @entity156 took @entity9 to the close without further alarms and if they and the rest of @entity9 ’s line - up bat big today and tomorrow then it will give @entity0 vital breathing space over which to consider his fate			2
feeling down : @entity164 looks lies on the floor as @entity42 pile on the runs in the runs : @entity24 and @entity48 both celebrate reaching 50 for @entity42 @entity170 is like back in @entity42 - @entity24 there is no appetite at the @entity151 to replace him as long as @entity9 do not go one down either here or at @entity176 ’s next week			1
but if they do and his barren run with the bat continues then @entity0 ’s grasp on the captaincy will weaken to a point where a change will become almost inevitable			2
in the wickets : @entity42 batsman @entity186 is run out by a direct hit from @entity188 glorious day : a full house at @entity52 enjoy day two of the test the long hangover from @entity9 ’s horror tour of @entity194 continues for @entity0 and thursday was perhaps his lowest point yet			1
@entity196 is running out now for him to save his captaincy skin			0
puzzled : @entity0 looks on as @entity9 struggle to get the final @entity76 wickets pressure mounting : @entity3 plays a shot on day two as @entity42 build their first innings score watching the ball : @entity42 's @entity204 plays a shot as @entity42 pile on the runs something to smile about : @entity27 celebrates the wicket of @entity210			1

@entity0 out for just five runs as his struggles with the bat continue
@entity42 bowled out for 457 in their first innings
@entity24 and @entity3 added 111 runs for the last wicket
