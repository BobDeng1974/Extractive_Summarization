by @entity0 the thought of it has never been far from @entity4 minds since the draw was made in @entity6 in february			0
facing @entity7 at any stage of a qualifying campaign is always a cause for concern but on the evidence of what transpired in @entity14 on tuesday , our date with @entity18 ’s side in @entity19 on september 7 suddenly has all the appeal of being tied to a railway track			1
@entity22 still has good reason for approaching the @entity25 qualifying campaign with a degree of cautious optimism , however			1
formidable : the @entity7 starting @entity28 line up ahead of their @entity30 semi-final against @entity33 on tuesday the @entity34 tweeted : just a quick reminder that our first @entity25 qualifier is @entity7 in @entity19 in september			1
# naeborra the past year under @entity38 has been characterised by markedly better organisation , spirit and results			1
defeating @entity42 home and away is the hallmark of a side on the rise			2
in a section also containing @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 , there are sound grounds for believing that our soon - to - be 18 - year exile from international competition may soon be over			2
yet ensuring the outlook remains as positive by the time we exit the @entity59 in just eight weeks ’ time is a tall order			0
whether @entity7 have claimed a fourth @entity30 by then or not , the ruthless manner of their historic 7 - 1 win over @entity33 was enough to send a shiver down the neck of every @entity67			1
here @entity68 takes an in - depth look at the formidable barrier facing @entity38 ’s side when our campaign gets underway			1
on their way : the @entity75 will head to @entity19 in september for the opening @entity25 qualifier the goalkeeper @entity79 ’s displays for both club and country over the past five seasons have instigated a moratorium on the debate over the greatest goalkeeper on the planet			1
there is simply none to be had			0
he would probably be out on his own were his talents to stretch no further than his shot - stopping ability — as evidenced by the concrete fist that repelled @entity94 ’s @entity93 in the quarter - final			1
that ’s only one of the strings on his bow , however			0
@entity79 ’s ability to turn defence into attack with his precision kicks and throws is one of @entity7 ’s most potent weapons			1
just look at the way the likes of @entity109 glides on to his heat - seeking missiles			2
safe hands : @entity112 goalkeeper @entity79 makes a save from a shot at goal by @entity33 's @entity116 yet @entity79 is n’t one to wait patiently in his goalmouth for the ball to come to him			1
the ‘ sweeper keeper ’ , as he ’s become known , is happy with the ball at his feet outside his box , thus letting his defence play a high line			0
a high - risk — but highly productive — strategy			2
he ’s a fearsome character , too			0
note his disgust when @entity116 scored the most meaningless consolation in history or how his enormous frame fills the goal before a penalty kick			0
the back four low has played either 4 - 3 - 3 or 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 throughout the competition , with only the personnel in the rearguard changing			1
@entity138 started in the holding midfield role but has reverted to right - back			2
that has allowed @entity142 to step inside one position to partner @entity144 , meaning there ’s been no need to expose @entity148 ’s lack of pace			0
@entity150 , the @entity152 left - back , has been a constant			2
irrespective of who is playing ahead of them , the defensive unit have no requirement to force the game			0
there ’s enough flare and invention in the six men further up the field to win the @entity166 ’s uncanny ability to play effectively as an 11th outfield player at times — @entity18 stated last week that he could comfortably play in midfield — naturally pushes his defenders higher up the pitch			0
making his point : @entity7 defender @entity142 ( left ) has a few words with @entity33 's @entity173 the midfield low normally operates with one holding player , so take your pick between multiple @entity179 winners @entity138 or @entity180			1
and , were his squad to be floored by some kind of plague , he could always turn to one of the @entity187 twins , @entity188 or @entity189 , who ply their trades for @entity19 and @entity191 respectively			1
and , for the record , neither made the cut for @entity33			1
just ahead of the ‘ pivot ’ , @entity18 deploys two narrow attacking midfielders , @entity180 — if he ’s not required to hold — @entity196 and / or @entity197			0
touch : @entity7 midfielder @entity180 ( right ) controls the ball under pressure from @entity116 the three are almost joined at the hip at times , tag - teaming whenever there ’s a growing crisis , but largely dominating possession , pressing and feeding the front three			1
as @entity33 found to their cost , it ’s all one and two touch , the ball being flashed around like it ’s following a laser			1
just try to disrupt that rhythm			0
in the air : @entity7 midfielder @entity197 kicks the ball during the semi-final in @entity14 the @entity217 so much for the death of the traditional no 9			1
low is still a big believer in having a penalty - box striker at the arrow ’s head and there are few better in world football than record - breaking @entity227			2
at 36 , the @entity4 might just have seen the back of the @entity230 man			0
he ’ll take 71 goals with him into international retirement , even if he does n’t score in sunday ’s final			2
@entity235 led the front line pretty well earlier in the campaign and is likely to revert there come september			2
on form : @entity7 's @entity235 ( right ) looks to take the ball round @entity33 goalkeeper @entity241 the supporting cast is n’t too bad either			1
@entity243 may have faded badly for @entity244 after a great start but his ability either coming in off the right or in the traditional no 10 role is beyond question			0
his team - mate @entity250 , a veteran of six tournaments at just 29 , remains both a prolific provider and scorer of goals , while @entity256 ’s @entity255 and @entity257 ’s @entity109 are indicative of a squad with seemingly boundless depth			0
the fact @entity7 have got this far without the injured @entity262 — @entity7 ’s best attacking player according to @entity264 — is ominous			2
strike : @entity7 and @entity244 midfielder @entity243 has a shot on goal during the 7 - 1 win over hosts @entity33 @entity270 , what chance do @entity4 have ? pretty slim , but then that ’s how we felt when the draw was made			1
it ’s a shot to nothing			0
a point on the opening night would be a godsend but , if that ’s beyond us , a positive performance against a nation that ’s truly arrived would be the next best thing			0
no one should lose sight of the bigger picture			0
the @entity287 were always going to be white - hot favourites to win the group , with @entity22 , @entity49 and @entity50 scrapping for the other automatic spot behind them — and if that ’s not to be , then third , which goes into a play - off			1
irrespective of whether @entity7 win the @entity30 or not on sunday , they ’ll be expected to go through the section with ease			1
as when we had @entity299 for company in the 2012 qualifiers , it wo n’t be our two games with them that will shape our qualification fate			0
it will be four matches with our direct rivals and any slip - ups against @entity51 or , heaven forbid , @entity52			0
on the beach : @entity22 manager @entity38 is working at the @entity30 for @entity311 as a pundit if we need inspiration , cite the case of @entity316 , who travelled to @entity318 in 2006 supposedly as lambs to the slaughter as the recently crowned world champions paraded the trophy			1
the result ? a score draw			0
@entity38 has also shown himself to be a shrewd tactician			2
you do n’t win in @entity42 , @entity327 and @entity50 unless you can contain opponents without loading the sandbags			0
yet , even before @entity330 sustained an injury that ’s likely to rule him out , september 7 was always likely to prove the toughest test of @entity38 ’s credentials			1
come what may , we will surely be able to reflect that we did better than the @entity336			0
that ’s a given , right ?			0

@entity38 's side open their @entity25 qualifying campaign against @entity7
the match takes place in @entity19 on sunday , september 7
@entity7 thrashed @entity33 7 - 1 in the @entity30 semi-finals on tuesday
@entity22 are looking to qualify for their first major finals since @entity94 *98*
