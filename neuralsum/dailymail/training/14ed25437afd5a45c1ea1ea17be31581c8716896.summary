there was no obvious access to any cellar but they then heard the sound of a large metal box being moved			0
the officers saw a man emerge from a hole in the floor along with a flood of light and a strong smell of cannabis			2
the man disappeared back down the hole after being challenged by the officers			0
they followed him through the secret trapdoor and down a ladder and discovered a four - room cellar filled with cannabis plants			1
further examination of the scene showed the metal box had been placed over the disguised trapdoor to conceal the cellar below , where they discovered @entity22 and @entity23			1
insp @entity96 , of the @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 , said : ' this was a highly sophisticated cannabis growing operation that the offenders went to great lengths to conceal within what at face value appeared to be a dusty old disused factory			1
officers entered through the secret trapdoor and down a ladder and discovered a four - room cellar filled with cannabis plants a metal box had been placed over the disguised trapdoor to conceal the cellar below , where they discovered @entity22 and @entity23 ' @entity114 however was n’t fooled and his suspicions led to the discovery of this cannabis farm and the downfall of the men running it			1
' neighbourhood officers like him spend a lot of time out in their communities and tend to notice when something is n’t right			0
' yet again a significant quantity of cannabis has been seized before it could enter the illegal drugs market that fuels crime and anti-social behaviour in our communities			0
' i would encourage local residents to look out for suspicious activity in their areas that could indicate a property is being used to grow cannabis			0
' if people notice an unusual smell , boarded - up windows , electrical equipment being delivered in significant quantities , or people coming and going at all hours , i would urge them to pass their suspicions on to us so we can check it out			0
