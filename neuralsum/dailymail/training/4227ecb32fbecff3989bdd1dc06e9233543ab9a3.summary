@entity0 has been ruled out for @entity2 ’s next two games after spraining an ankle during tuesday ’s fiery @entity5 qualifier against @entity6			1
the @entity2 captain was taken off in the 50th minute in the @entity8 after a challenge from former @entity11 striker @entity10			1
@entity2 will also be without @entity12 for the second leg with the @entity15 side after he was sent off for a second yellow card in the second half			1
he will have another scan on the affected area on thursday , but is definitely out of @entity2 ’s next two matches			1
@entity2 ’s injury list is already beginning to mount after @entity33 and @entity34 missed the 0 - 0 draw in @entity36			1
@entity2 wo n’t find it easy in the second leg against @entity6 , especially without @entity12 and @entity0 , but they have never gone out of the @entity5 at the qualifying stage			1
2013 - 14 - beat @entity40 5 - 0 on agg , reached second round 2011 - 12 - beat @entity43 3 - 1 on agg , reached second round 2009 - 10 - beat @entity45 5 - 1 on agg , reached quarter - finals 2008 - 09 - beat @entity48 6 - 0 on agg , reached semi-finals 2007 - 08 - beat @entity51 5 - 0 on agg , reached quarter - finals 2006 - 07 - beat @entity54 5 - 1 on agg , reached second round @entity56 also confirmed last night that @entity6 boss @entity57 will be suspended from the technical area after he was sent off in the final moments of the first leg			1
@entity57 serves a one - match ban and will have no access to the dressing room or his players when they arrive at the @entity28 on wednesday			2
@entity56 are also considering the incident which led to @entity18 making a complaint to the match delegate after a bottle was hurled at his head when he walked off the pitch			2
@entity18 escaped injury , but @entity2 immediately lodged a complaint			1
trouble : @entity6 manager @entity57 ( right ) has been handed a minimum one - game suspension by @entity56 @entity2 escaped with a draw in the first leg and they have had a sluggish start to the season as they bed in with a new team , edging past @entity79 on the opening day and then enduring a frustrating stalemate in @entity15			1
this weekend , when they travel to @entity82 to play @entity23 for the tea - time kick - off , they will be boosted by the return of their @entity86 - winning trio			1
@entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 will be in the squad and @entity2 midfielder @entity91 is convinced they will make a big difference			2
comeback : @entity87 will return to the @entity2 squad having watched tuesday 's clash on television @entity91 , who has started both of @entity2 ’s opening two games , said : ‘ they ’re @entity100 and they ’ve got fantastic mentality anyway			1
last year we saw that			0
they ’re great characters to have in the dressing room and great players as well			0
we ’re looking forward to getting them back and it ’s going to make our squad even stronger			0
‘ we have worked all year			0
we were in and around the top and in the end we fell away but we worked really hard to be in the top four			0
‘ we always want to be in the @entity5 to attract players who want to play in the @entity5			0
we have players at the club who have to play in the @entity5			2
so we know it ’s a big game and we ’ll treat it as a cup final in the second leg			0
’ big difference : @entity91 is confident @entity2 's returning @entity100 's willmake the squad stronger @entity18 described @entity12 's red card in @entity36 as ' unbelievable '			1
the @entity124 midfielder , who apologised to fans via @entity126 after the game , will serve a one - game @entity129 ban and misses wednesday ’s match			2
@entity91 defended @entity2 ’s conduct against @entity6 , saying : ‘ i do n’t think the tackles crossed the line			1
that ’s always going to be the type of challenge you ’d expect in a match of this type			0
we put in some as well			0
it was a fair game and the ref did a good job			0
‘ it was harsh to send off @entity12 but in the rule book that ’s how it is			0
two minutes after he did it , someone did it to me and did n’t get booked			0
that ’s the only problem sometimes — with consistency			0
but i suppose in the rule book it is a booking			0
’ @entity154 red card unbelievable - @entity18			2
