by @entity0 published : 03:46 est , 13 september 2012 updated : 03:50 est , 13 september 2012 deceptive : former @entity3 detective @entity2 failed to properly investigate 13 sex crimes eleven suspected sex attackers may never be brought to justice because a detective failed to investigate crimes properly			1
@entity2 , 30 , lied to rape victims that their cases had been dropped , avoided interviewing key witnesses , failed to get @entity13 footage of attacks and did not send exhibits for forensic analysis			1
the former metropolitan police officer bungled 13 cases in total , and yesterday pleaded guilty in court to 13 counts of misconduct in a public office			1
the offences were carried out between january 2007 and september 2010 , while @entity2 worked as a detective constable on @entity3 's @entity27 unit , which deals with investigations into rape and sexual assault			1
he was sacked last year after an internal investigation			1
@entity32 heard that @entity2 's misconduct related to 10 rape cases and three sexual assault inquiries			1
prosecutor @entity36 said that in ' almost all ' of the 13 cases involved , no proceedings had resulted			0
the investigations included 12 complainants and 11 suspects , he said			0
@entity2 , from @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , was taken to court after an inquiry by the @entity45 ( @entity45 )			2
the investigation followed complaints by a sex worker called @entity49 , who claimed she was being stalked by a client in 2009 and was unhappy with the way @entity2 had handled the harassment allegations			1
miss @entity53 later took her own life in an apparent suicide pact with another sex worker @entity56 , and no findings were made against @entity2 in relation to that case			1
but the @entity45 probe uncovered the officer 's misconduct in other investigations			0
@entity45 deputy chairman @entity64 said : ' @entity65 was entrusted to investigate serious sexual offences and support some of the most vulnerable people in the criminal justice system			2
' he let them down by his calculated abuse of their trust			0
his actions are beyond belief			0
' after mr @entity2 's initial criminal interview with the @entity45 in november 2010 , we submitted a file to the @entity78 ( @entity78 ) to allow them to fast - track the misconduct process , and the @entity78 dismissed him in april 2011 while our investigation continued			1
' shame : @entity2 , who pleaded guilty to 13 counts of misconduct in a public office , walked with his head bowed outside court she said that the force had reviewed all cases where @entity2 was in charge and that he was ' a rogue officer who set out to deceive '			1
ms @entity64 continued : ' the mps have told us they reviewed all cases where mr @entity2 was officer in charge and i understand that where cases required further or re-investigation this has been done			2
' our investigation did not reveal systemic or serious supervisory failings			0
while we may never fully understand the motivation for his actions , mr @entity2 appears to have been a rogue officer who set out to deceive			2
' while dealing with rogue individuals must always be a concern in any system , supervisory systems will not necessarily pick up on an officer who has concocted evidence to cover their tracks			0
' in pleading guilty , @entity65 has at least spared some of his victims the burden of reliving their experiences , in court , of how their cases were , or were not investigated			2
' the @entity45 said that @entity2 had made false or misleading crime report entries 32 times , falsified a witness statement and twice claimed he had interviewed a rape suspect without actually doing so			1
he also faked suspect accounts on three occasions , falsely claimed to have taken witness statements 15 times and said he had submitted files to the @entity127 without having done so seven times			0
the @entity78 said that after reviewing the 13 cases , ' no additional evidential or judicial opportunities were identified '			2
commander @entity131 said : ' we expect the highest standard of conduct from our officers , particularly within the @entity136 with its clear focus on victim care			0
' this individual clearly fell well below those standards and it is therefore only right that he take full responsibility for his failings			0
' his dismissal and subsequent criminal conviction sends a clear message to both the public and colleagues that neither the police service nor the courts will tolerate such serious professional failings			0
' judge @entity152 granted @entity2 - @entity2 bail			0
the former officer is due to be sentenced next month			0
misconduct : @entity32 heard that @entity2 's actions compromised 10 rape cases and three sexual assault inquiries			1

@entity65 , 30 , failed to get @entity13 footage of alleged attacks or send exhibits for forensic analysis
he twice claimed to have interviewed a rape suspect when he had *n't*
misconduct means 11 suspected sex attackers may never be caught
@entity2 pleaded guilty at @entity32 to 13 counts of misconduct in a public office
@entity78 sacked him last year after internal investigation
