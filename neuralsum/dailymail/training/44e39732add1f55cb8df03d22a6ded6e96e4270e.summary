@entity0 review to include all players and staff @entity3 and @entity4 unlikely to be criticised @entity6 players active on phone app tinder while in @entity8 by @entity9 published : 18:00 est , 5 january 2014 updated : 18:26 est , 5 january 2014 the internal @entity0 review into the shambolic @entity13 surrender will include each player and all support staff giving their comments about this dismal tour			1
and their feedback , to be collated by new @entity6 managing director @entity21 , will need to be critical in the extreme about @entity4 and @entity3 for there to be any changes to that leadership duo			1
@entity0 chairman @entity26 and chief executive @entity27 have been unequivocal that @entity4 and @entity3 will stay on as team director and captain respectively , despite the 5 - 0 whitewash that would certainly lead to sackings in other sports			1
going nowhere : @entity6 captain @entity3 , pictured here leading his team from the field after losing the final @entity35 to @entity8 , is unlikely to be removed from his position the players ’ response , with the dressing room staying remarkably united in the circumstances , is unlikely to condemn captain or coach and nor will @entity21 , who needs time to settle into a job he does not start officially until next month			1
after such a fiasco , it would be ridiculous for no heads to roll			0
so batting coach @entity47 and @entity48 , @entity4 ’s deputy and fielding coach , are the most likely scapegoats			1
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
. the hallowed home dressing room at the @entity52 was opened up to @entity53 when they held a training session there on a pre-season tour			0
unimpressed with the setting was @entity53 boss @entity57 , who shares his predecessor ’s belief that if @entity60 do n’t play it , it does n’t count as a sport			0
coincidentally , @entity6 captain @entity3 revealed after the 5 - 0 whitewash that he is halfway through sir @entity64 ’s book , which is giving him the inspiration to carry on			1
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
poor @entity66 might have failed to lure @entity69 backpacker @entity68 to his hotel room in @entity71 via social media after the fourth - @entity74 defeat			0
but it is understood a couple of the divorced spinner ’s single @entity6 team - mates have had a lot more success on tour using the same matchmaking phone app tinder that facilitates meeting viable partners in the user ’s surrounding area			1
no luck : some of @entity6 spinner @entity66 's team - mates are believed to have had success with matchmaking app tinder while in @entity8 this @entity6 tour seems to have gone pear - shaped since some of the squad got upset that their last few days at home before 10 weeks @entity93 would be taken up by a team - bonding exercise — still , bizarrely , the subject of the utmost secrecy			1
it was organised by former @entity100 soldier @entity99 , who is ceo of @entity101 , described as one of the leading values - based performance optimisation organisations			2
too strong : @entity6 performed poorly against @entity8 , pictured here celebrating their @entity13 victory , after attending a team - bonding exercise before travelling @entity93 the only public mention of the @entity109 - based trip is @entity99 ’s tweet : ‘ outstanding three days with one of my favourite teams			1
' they picked up complicated training quickly and executed the drills to perfection			0
’ if one word sums up @entity6 ’s displays since , it ai n’t perfection			2
‘ assassins ’ fire blanks the test team dressing - room doors display — as part of security regulations — the mugshots of all those allowed access			2
there were 34 on the @entity6 door compared to @entity8 ’s 31 , including an excessive number of support personnel who only helped muddle minds judging by the performances			1
struggling : @entity6 's @entity135 was forced to quit this winter 's @entity13 series with a stress - related illness the work done by sports psychologist @entity141 has to be questioned with so many @entity6 players failing to cope with the stresses of an @entity13 tour			1
@entity141 , who gave up cricket after suffering the yips , uses profiling tools to characterise people			0
he said pre-tour : ‘ @entity3 is a really good example of an assassin ( a thinker ) , someone who ’s able repeatedly to stay within his bubble and do his own thing			2
@entity135 and @entity154 are also assassins			0
’ how wrong could he be ? former @entity6 spinner @entity156 , in @entity8 working as a pundit for @entity158 , is the leading candidate to become a @entity74 selector			1
it would be a good move because @entity156 is very much his own man			2
other contenders include @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166			2
@entity167 , @entity168 ’s overrated pundit who repeats the same lines again and again , seems to save his fresh opinions for insulting @entity171			0
i am now a ‘ f * * * wit ’ , according to the @entity174 former leg - spinner			0
opinionated : @entity174 cricket pundit @entity167 ( right ) , pictured here congratulating @entity174 captain @entity176 ( left ) , has had his say on @entity178 's @entity9			0

@entity0 review to include all players and staff
@entity3 and @entity4 unlikely to be criticised
@entity6 players active on phone app tinder while in @entity8
@entity156 is the leading candidate to become a test selector
