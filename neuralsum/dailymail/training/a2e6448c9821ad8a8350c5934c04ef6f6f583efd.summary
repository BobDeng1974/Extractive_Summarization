@entity43 , who runs the information and enquiry service at the charity @entity46 , said : ' migraines and stress are strongly linked			0
' indeed , anxiety , excitement and any form of tension and shock may all lead to a migraine attack			0
' however , some people report that their migraines start when the stress reduces			2
' this is sometimes experienced as weekend headaches , when , after a busy and stressful week at work , an individual might experience a migraine at the weekend when they relax after being stressed			0
' although stress is often unavoidable , it is important to try to reduce the effects of other migraine triggers during a stressful time , for example by eating regularly and getting adequate sleep , which can also help in dealing with stress			0
' for the study , 5,159 people age 21 to 71 in the general population were surveyed about their stress levels and headaches four times a year for two years			2
participants stated how many headaches they had per month and rated their stress level on a scale of zero to 100			0
a total of 31 per cent of the participants had tension - type headache , 14 per cent had migraine , 11 per cent had migraine combined with tension - type headache and for 17 per cent the headache type was not classified			0
those with tension - type headache rated their stress at an average of 52 out of 100			2
for migraine , it was 62 out of 100 and 59 for those with migraine and tension - type headache			0
for each type of headache , an increase in stress was associated with an increase in the number of headaches per month			2
for those with tension headache , an increase of 10 points on the stress scale was associated with a 6.3 - percent increase in the number of headache days per month			1
for migraine , the number of headache days per month went up by 4.3 per cent , and 4 per cent for those with migraine and tension headache			1
the results were adjusted to account for factors that could affect the number of headaches , such as drinking , smoking and frequent use of headache drugs			0

the most stressed people had six per cent more headache days each month , researchers found she said : ‘ these results show that this is a problem for everyone who suffers from headaches and emphasise the importance of stress management approaches for people with migraine and those who treat them			1
‘ the results add weight to the concept that stress can be a factor contributing to the onset of headache disorders , that it accelerates the progression to chronic headache , exacerbates headache episodes , and that the headache experience itself can serve as a stressor			0
