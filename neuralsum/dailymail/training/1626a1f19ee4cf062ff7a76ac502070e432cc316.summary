by @entity0 , @entity1 editor published : 15:58 est , 1 april 2013 updated : 05:21 est , 2 april 2013 a @entity3 cabinet minister today invites @entity4 to join forces to end the human rights ‘ madness ’ keeping @entity8 in @entity9			1
justice secretary @entity10 says the system has gone ‘ badly wrong ’ when the @entity9 can not deport a man ‘ who so obviously despises what we stand for ’			2
writing in the @entity16 , he says that the conservatives would change human rights laws immediately – but they do not have the votes needed in @entity20			1
@entity10 has called on @entity21 to the human rights ' madness ' keeping @entity8 , pictured , in @entity9 justice secretary @entity10 said his party would change human rights laws but need @entity4 's cooperation ministers are being thwarted by their @entity28 partners who have vowed to fight even modest changes to the law			1
but , in an audacious move , mr @entity10 is appealing to the @entity21 leadership to ‘ support radical reform of our human rights laws ’			1
he urges : ‘ we have given up far too much of our own sovereignty			0
‘ we have given up too many of our own democratic rights			0
we need to reverse the changes			0
’ mr @entity10 ’s offer , which could result in immediate legislation , places mr @entity4 in a hugely difficult position			1
labour grandees , including ex-home secretary @entity44 , have warned that the @entity46 debacle is undermining faith in the entire human rights regime			1
lord @entity44 said : ‘ the danger in the long run is that if people believe the law as it stands			0
is open to misuse , then the demand grows to throw out the whole thing			0
’ but , while helping to reform human rights law would be hugely popular , mr @entity4 would need the courage to carry his party with him			1
many @entity21 mps view the @entity60 – passed by @entity61 in 1998 – as an article of faith which can not be touched			0
mr @entity10 wants to legislate for a ‘ dramatically curtailed role for the @entity65 in the @entity9 ’			2
one option is to prevent the court from overriding the clearly expressed wishes of the @entity9 @entity20			0
@entity21 has repeatedly sniped at the government over the failure to boot out @entity46 , but has not said how it would tackle the issue after spending six years trying – and failing – to kick out the hate - filled cleric while in government			2
last week , the @entity74 ruled that @entity46 could not be deported to @entity75 on terror charges in case his right to a fair trial was breached			1
the judges accepted @entity46 was ‘ very dangerous ’ , but said this was ‘ not a relevant consideration ’ under human rights laws			1
the decision – which raises the chilling prospect of @entity9 being stuck with the fanatic for life – was based on an earlier ruling by @entity90			0
mr @entity10 ’s @entity16 article delivers a devastating analysis of the problems the legislation – working in tandem with the @entity65 – is causing for the government			2
he says the remit of the @entity65 has ‘ gone mad ’			0
former home secretary @entity44 warned that the @entity46 debacle is undermining faith in the human rights regime while @entity101 wants to leave the agreement to make it easier to deport foreign terrorists but he says it is for politicians to change the law , and reaches out to @entity21 and the @entity108 to find a solution , rather than limp on to the 2015 general election without change			1
he says : ‘ i would welcome an agreement from @entity113 and @entity4 to support radical reform of our human rights laws			1
we would deliver those changes at the earliest possible opportunity			0
’ the @entity46 ruling has renewed demands for radical action			2
@entity3 vice-chairman @entity122 said @entity9 must leave the @entity123 in the wake of the defeat			0
home secretary @entity101 also wants to leave the agreement to make it easier to deport foreign terrorists and criminals			1
yet , last week , justice minister @entity130 said the official position is that no preparations are being made to walk away			0
the statement reflects how the @entity134 is having to bend over backwards to keep the @entity108 happy			0
in his @entity136 radio show last week , mr @entity113 said the government remains determined to deport @entity46 , but would not be prepared to ignore the court ’s ruling .			2
