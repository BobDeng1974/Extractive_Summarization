relatives of those killed on the @entity3 flight have been offered up to £ 40,000 from @entity4 immediately , amid speculation they could receive multi-million pound compensation settlements eventually			1
the @entity8 airline , which owns the budget carrier , offered to pay up to 50,000 euros per passenger , for immediate financial assistance			1
however , the relatives could receive multi-million pound compensation settlements if they can prove that @entity4 knew about the co-pilot 's mental health difficulties			1
@entity15 found at @entity17 's apartment in @entity18 by @entity8 police could form a key part of any legal case launched by the families			1
legal experts claim that the level of awareness the passengers had in advance of the crash would also influence any compensation payments			2
@entity4 , which owns @entity3 , has so far refused to comment on whether they had any concerns over @entity17 's mental health			1
ordinarily , the families of air disasters are entitled to a maximum of around £ 100,000 under international agreements			2
but if a family decides to sue , this figure could rise dramatically depending on the degree of negligence by the airline and the level of awareness their loved ones would have had on their impending doom			1
as well as looking at @entity17 , lawyers for the families could question the airline 's policy of not requiring at least two crew on the flight deck at all times once the aircraft is airborne			1
relatives of some of tuesday 's victims have reacted angrily to the discovery of the torn up sick note and questions over @entity17 's mental health			1
@entity4 's chief executive @entity80 refused to respond to questions about @entity17 's mental health @entity81 , whose 59 - year - old brother , @entity82 , died in the crash said : ' when you first learn that , you do n’t believe it , we try to tell ourselves that it ’s not possible			1
' looking back , i slowly start to be angry			2
i do n’t understand how a serious company can let a depressed man pilot a plane			2
‘ because the boy was depressed , it was necessary to say he was			2
on this point i am opposed to the company not having introduced rules saying there must always be two people in the cockpit			2
‘ i ’ve fallen over backwards			2
it ’s not normal to leave somebody by himself in charge , and who shuts the doors , i ’m very angry			2
' passengers would have been soon aware of captain @entity107 's attempts to break into his own cockpit after @entity17 deliberately locked him outside			1
@entity17 enabled a post- 911 safety system designed to stop hijacking to bolt the cockpit door shut			1
@entity4 chief executive @entity80 admitted yesterday that @entity17 had broken off his training in 2008 for several months , however , he refused to elaborate on the details			1
@entity115 prime minister @entity114 , second right , said the airline should release all information on @entity119 the latest revelations come as air crash investigators continue to search for the second ' black box ' @entity115 prime minister @entity114 said the airline must hand over all information they have on @entity119 to investigators			2
mr @entity114 held a crisis meeting this morning where tuesday 's disaster was the main item on the agenda			1
he told @entity128 : ' we must wait for the end of the inquiry			2
i am careful when there is a judicial inquiry , but everything points to a criminal , mad , suicidal action that we can not comprehend			0
' it is up to this company to provide a maximum of information so that we can understand why this pilot committed this dreadful act			0
' air crash investigators confirmed that @entity17 , 28 , programmed the @entity145 320 's autopilot to descend from 38,000 to just 100 feet , while the aircraft crossing the @entity115 coast towards the @entity148 , after his captain @entity107 left the flight deck to go to the toilet			1
however , @entity115 pilots ' union @entity152 said it is suing prosecutors who leaked information on ongoing developments in the case to the press			1
pilots fear that they will lose the public 's confidence after it emerged that @entity17 deliberately flew into a mountain			1
hundreds of students from the @entity165 school arrived at a memorials service today @entity167 of @entity115 's @entity152 union told @entity169 on friday that the lawsuit is over violating a @entity115 law on keeping information about investigations secret while they are ongoing			1
the lawsuit does n't name an alleged perpetrator , a method in @entity115 law that leaves investigators to determine who is at fault			0
mr @entity167 said : ' we can understand there is a certain pressure , a wish to know			0
' he warned that leaking information too early can mislead the public instead of informing accurately			0
@entity187 also expressed concern about the leaks and urged further investigation before drawing final conclusions			0
in a statement , the @entity187 said : ' our thoughts are with the victims and their relatives			2
as trusted professionals , who invest a lifelong career in making air travel safe , this is a very difficult day for us			0

' however , one friend said he used to go to movies and clubs together , but had noticed a considerable change over the past twelve months			0
the friend said : ' flying was his life			0
he always used to be a quiet companion , but in the last year that got worse			0
' @entity223 , a @entity224 - based specialist in aviation medicine , said it was extremely difficult to conduct screening for psychiatric problems among pilots , in part because they can put their careers in jeopardy by admitting to such problems			0
he said : ' if somebody wants to withhold or conceal , there 's no reasonable test			2
' mr @entity223 said unless a family member comes forward and reports their concerns , then it is possible for cases such as @entity17 to ' slip through '			1
