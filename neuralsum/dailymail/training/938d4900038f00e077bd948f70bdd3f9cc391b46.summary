@entity0 , 30 , who had been pictured with the @entity16 and visited @entity17 and @entity18 through his work with the charity , collapsed after taking the drug while the quintet were enjoying a ‘ lads ’ weekend ’			1
as his friends took a taxi to the hospital where he lay dying , they agreed to lie to police about who had supplied the drugs , each sticking to their story as they were questioned while he suffered a fatal heart attack in intensive care			1
when they appeared in court yesterday , mr @entity0 ’s mother – who herself works in drugs rehabilitation – movingly addressed the judge about how the family ’s lives would never be the same again after the loss of ‘ our beloved , beautiful son ’			1
and @entity44 hit out at how his friends ’ lies had caused them ‘ additional anguish and unacceptable stress ’ by prolonging their ordeal for more than a year			1
she said : ‘ in the early hours of september 28 we were told our beloved , beautiful son , brother and partner had died , ’ she said			2
‘ a part of us has died and our lives will never be the same without @entity0			1
@entity56 left @entity57 having been sentenced to eight months ' jail suspended guilty men : @entity60 ( left ) and @entity61 ( right ) walked free from court having received suspended sentences of eight and 12 months ' imprisonment respectively @entity65 pictured leaving court today was also given eight months ' jail after pleading guilty to perverting the course of justice , and again his sentence was suspended ‘ we all feel cheated at not being able to see and celebrate @entity0 marry @entity1 and have children , and the bright future at @entity8 that he will never have			1
’ she added that his friends ’ ‘ lies ’ had caused ‘ additional anguish and unacceptable stress ’ by delaying an inquest that would have enabled them to grieve properly			1
‘ every day for us feels like a mountain to climb , ’ she concluded			0
‘ we are a broken family and we will never get over this			0
‘ we have lost our sparkle until the day we leave this world			0
’ mr @entity0 and @entity1 ( left ) at a party alongside his brothers @entity85 and @entity87 and their girlfriends mr @entity0 and his friends , @entity56 , now 30 , @entity60 , 31 , @entity61 , 31 , and @entity65 , 29 , had driven up from their homes around @entity91 , @entity92 in september last year for a night at the @entity94 nightclub in @entity95			1
on the way , with the exception of site engineer @entity65 , who abstained throughout , they took cocaine and ecstasy that @entity101 – who owns a gym - had agreed to buy ahead of the trip , and their excitement is plain in photographs as they prepared to set off from the apartment they were renting			0
but they became separated from @entity111 over the course of the night , @entity57 in @entity95 was told yesterday , assuming he had gone back to their room early			2
@entity0 ( far right , in white t - shirt with red lanyard ) with the @entity16 in reality , he had been found unconscious in the courtyard area by security staff and taken to @entity120 by ambulance			0
by the time the quartet was traced , they were back at their accommodation , and immediately took a taxi to be with him , @entity127 , prosecuting , said , agreeing en route to tell police they had bought the drugs from someone in the club rather than reveal the truth			0
‘ it may be the view of those who listen that the most obvious motive was to protect mr @entity61 , who clearly was at risk , ’ he added			2
@entity0 died after taking ecstasy at @entity94 in @entity95 ( above ) mr @entity0 , who was otherwise healthy , died at around 5am from a heart attack caused by ‘ excessive consumption of ecstasy ’ , a post mortem examination revealed			1
as a result , police resources were diverted to putting out alerts about a possibly fatal ‘ bad batch ’ of drugs circulating around the club when in reality the group had brought them from their home county			1
it was only when mr @entity0 ’s mobile phone was examined two months later that messages they had exchanged on the @entity158 social media platform in the run - up to the fateful weekend revealed @entity61 had been nominated to supply the drugs , and they were all arrested			1
at their sentencing hearing yesterday , they stared straight ahead or at the ground as mr @entity0 ’s mother stood in the witness box and read out sections of her victim impact statement , as his girlfriend @entity1 and other relatives wept in the public gallery			1
@entity0 , on a previous night out , was otherwise healthy			2
he died at around 5am from a heart attack caused by ‘ excessive consumption of ecstasy ’ , a post mortem examination revealed barristers for the four men , who all arrived in suits and carrying hold - alls in preparation for prison , argued that they had been deeply affected by the loss of their friend and that a lie which began while all were suffering from the effects of drink or drugs had ‘ snowballed ’			1
judge @entity187 described all five as ‘ decent , hard - working young men ’ , all but one of whom had decided to ‘ boost ’ their enjoyment of a ‘ lads ’ weekend ’ by taking drugs			1
‘ activity of this kind is sometimes described as recreational use of drugs as if such activity were perfectly acceptable and legitimate , ’ he said			2
‘ quite the reverse – it ’s criminal			0
’ he added that while what they had done may be ‘ fashionable ’ , it was not only illegal , but it could have a profound impact , including ‘ from time to time , as occurred on this occasion , with fatal consequences			0
’ he said they had failed in their duty to their friend to tell the truth about what had happened , but accepted that all had ‘ excellent ’ work records and were genuinely remorseful , agreeing to suspend their prison sentences			2
@entity61 , who admitted supplying ecstasy and cocaine , and perverting the course of justice , was given 12 months suspended for 18 months			0
@entity60 and @entity56 - an operations manager for a manufacturing firm - were given eight months after admitting possessing ecstasy and cocaine , and perverting the course of justice , while @entity65 was also given eight months after pleading guilty to perverting the course of justice , also suspended			1
the four defendants , who are all from @entity91 , were also ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work in the community			0
afterwards detective inspector @entity227 , of @entity228 , said : ‘ this is a very sad case – it ’s five lads who ’ve travelled to @entity95 for an enjoyable night out , and they ’re left with one of them dead and the other four in court because of the consequences of one poor choice			1

‘ we do n't want to have any obituary or such like printed but have decided that his life was too precious and important to go unreported			0
' everyone who knew @entity0 was aware he loved life ' ‘ he played local football for @entity250 teams up until the age of 16 , @entity252 and finally @entity253			2
@entity0 was a keen sportsman , avid follower of @entity256 @entity255 and only last week completed the ‘ @entity264 ’ challenge for @entity258 in @entity259			2
@entity0 was known by many as having a big heart , big personality and the most infectious smile in @entity91			1
‘ @entity0 lost his life tragically , senselessly and needlessly in a nightclub in @entity95 on a lads ' weekend			1
this has devastated the lives of us , his parents , his two brothers @entity85 and @entity87 , and his beautiful and devoted girlfriend , @entity1			0
our family and friends , @entity0 's friends , work colleagues and all those who had the privilege of knowing him and those he helped in his employment at the @entity8			2

‘ everyone who knew @entity0 was aware he loved life , lived it to the max and in making one stupid mistake he has cost himself his life			0
‘ we hope that after reading this , we may have gone some way in helping anyone / everyone in the realisation that drinking and use of any illicit drugs are a killer with consequences that will devastate lives for ever			0
‘ our thanks go to all those who have taken to time to send messages of support to out family			0
