they normally inhabit the deep waters far off our coast , but thanks to our warm weather huge barrel jellyfish , weighing up to 35kg , have been spotted just off the beaches of @entity8			1
attracted by plentiful plankton the creatures have ventured closer to shore as they feed and reproduce in vast numbers , forming dense groups known as blooms			1
scuba diving photographer @entity15 captured this creature with his 6 ’ 3 ' tall son @entity17 , just off @entity18 , @entity19 , mr @entity15 was stunned to find a massive group of barrel jellyfish spread out over an area of eight square miles towards @entity23			1
@entity24 : will @entity15 , who for reference to scale is 6ft 3in , swims with a barrel jellyfish off @entity8 beast from the deep : the jellyfish was pictured close to @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity8 ‘ we usually get perhaps a dozen sightings a year , ’ said mr @entity15			1
‘ but at the moment they are everywhere , itís like a super bloom with some of them a metre and a half in size			0
‘ there is a massive amount of plankton forming which they seem to be feeding on			0
’ the @entity44 said it had received reports of jellyfish being spotted across the south coast and west coast of @entity49 , as well as parts of @entity51 because of the warmer weather			1
easily identified by their distinctive smooth bell and cauliflower - shaped mass of tentacles that house hundreds of tiny mouths , a digestive system and stinging cells , the jellyfish feed only on microscopic plankton but thankfully pose no threat to swimmers as their sting is not strong enough to harm humans			1
last month one of the dustbin - lid - sized creatures was spotted swimming up the @entity70 in @entity8 , fuelling predictions that this summer would see a barrage of the animals photographer @entity15 was stunned to find a massive group of barrel jellyfish spread out over an area of eight square miles towards @entity23 @entity17 , 16 , said : ‘ it was my first encounter swimming with them and although there ’s nothing to fear from their sting i felt fine as i was in a drysuit			1
‘ there was a tiny little fish living in the tentacles that appeared to be immune to the sting , they could swim relatively quickly for a jellyfish , perhaps about half a kilometre per hour			1

both humans and jellyfish will be glad to know continuous sunshine could be on the way for the next 40 days – if @entity99 folklore is to be believed			1
many will welcome the fact the @entity102 is forecasting bright sunshine and temperatures of @entity105 , as superstition states that if the sun shines on july 15 , it will continue to do so for the next 40 days			2
temperatures were expected to reach @entity105 across many parts of the country yesterday before soaring to the late twenties on thursday and friday making @entity99 hotter than some @entity113 holiday destinations including @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116			1

sun - seekers enjoyed the sunshine in @entity119 today , including @entity131 , one ( left ) , and @entity120 , six ( right ) wednesday also looks promising , with the bulk of @entity49 and @entity133 likely to remain dry and sunny			2
it will herald the start of another hot spell in @entity99 , where temperatures could exceed those in popular @entity113 holiday destinations such as @entity116 , @entity114 and @entity115			1
temperatures will start to rise from thursday , peaking on friday when the @entity142 barrier could be reached for the first time this year , with the most likely location somewhere to the north - west of @entity146			1

the hottest day of 2014 so far was july 4 , when @entity157 ( @entity158 ) was detected in @entity159 and @entity160			2
pictured : one lady cycles past cattle on @entity163 in @entity164 , where the sun peeped through the grey clouds however , the balmy conditions towards the end of the week – which could see the hottest day of the year so far surpassed – could bring ‘ thundery ’ rain			1
mr @entity171 said there was a chance heavy showers could develop in parts of the @entity99 on thursday before it clears later in the afternoon			1
however , despite the blip , temperatures are expected to rise to a sweltering @entity124 in many parts of the country on thursday and friday , including in the south east which is set to enjoy some of the warmest weather in the @entity99 over the next few days			1

however , despite the ‘ hot and humid ’ weather , forecasters have warned the conditions could be uncomfortable for some as it will feel muggy instead of fresh			0
@entity102 forecaster @entity189 said ‘ thundery downpours ’ could give brief respite from the hot and sticky weather on friday and saturday			0
she said : ‘ most people wo n't enjoy these conditions			0
it can be difficult sleeping during the hot humid nights			0
‘ although it probably is shorts and t - shirt weather , you will need a brolly at the same time			0

while legend states that rain on july 15 means it will rain for the next 40 days , it also says that if it remains dry for the day , the country will be in for 40 days of sun. pictured : @entity209 , 22 , wanders through @entity210 in @entity211 despite the ' hot and humid ' weather over the next few days , forecasters have warned the conditions could be uncomfortable for some people as it will feel muggy and sticky instead of fresh			2

while the legend states that rain on july 15 means it will rain for the next 40 days , it also says that if it remains dry for the day , the country will be in for 40 days of sunshine			0
the @entity99 folklore dates back to c.800 , when @entity152 was a @entity232 bishop at @entity233			2
as he lay on his deathbed he asked to be buried outside where he would be trodden on and rained on			0
his wishes were followed for nine years , then on july 15 , 971 , the monks of @entity233 attempted to remove his remains to a shrine inside the cathedral			0
this week 's warm weather heralds the start of another hot spell in @entity99 , where temperatures could exceed those in popular @entity113 holiday destinations such as @entity116 , @entity114 and @entity115			1
pictured : a man enjoys a walk through @entity163 in @entity164 this afternoon as the sun makes a break through the clouds according to legend , the removal was accompanied by ferocious and violent rain storms which lasted 40 days and nights and were said to indicate the saint 's displeasure at being moved			0
the story soon became @entity99 folklore and ever since the weather patterns on july 15 have been closely followed by the superstitious			2
the folklore ’s rhyme reads : ' @entity152 ’s day if thou dost rain , for 40 days it will remain			0
@entity152 ’s day if thou be fair , for 40 days ’ twill rain no more			0
' however , the @entity102 has routinely said there is no ‘ scientific evidence ’ supporting the folklore and said numerous studies have been carried out on past weather observations , with none proving the legend to be true			0
it also said that since the start of records in 1861 , there has been neither 40 dry or 40 wet days following the corresponding weather on @entity152 's day			0
while it is unlikely that any one location will see rain fall every day for the next 40 , there is some element of truth to weather patterns continuing			0
by this point in the summer , the jet stream is usually set in a pattern which tends to last until the end of august			2
the jet stream is a fast - flowing current of air located around four to seven miles up in the atmosphere			0
it tends to steer the areas of high and low pressure around the globe and marks a boundary between cold air to the north and warmer air to the south			0
if it is sitting to the north of the @entity99 , then warm air tends to invade from the south , usually associated with high pressure building in from the @entity305 , leading to fine and settled weather for the @entity307			1
however , should the jet stream sit across the @entity99 or to the south , then cooler air from the north is dragged down and low pressure systems move across the country from the @entity314 , leading to unsettled weather			2
so far , the jet stream is pointing directly towards the @entity307 , indicating unsettled weather .			0
