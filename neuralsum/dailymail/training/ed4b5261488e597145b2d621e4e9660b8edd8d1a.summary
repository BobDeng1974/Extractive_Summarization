@entity1 mass killer @entity0 has a rare , high - functioning form of @entity3 's that has left him incapable of empathy or real friendship , one of @entity1 's most prominent psychiatrists has told a court in @entity9			1
professor @entity10 of @entity11 told the court : ' it is plausible that there is @entity3 's , @entity14 's , and a narcissistic personality disorder			1
' as evidence , he cited the lack of emotion @entity0 showed when discussing those he killed , his impressive memory for details , his obsession with numbers , his hypergraphia [ obsessive writing ] , and his monotonous tone of voice			2
testimony : @entity10 , a professor of psychiatry , testifies in the case against terror and murder charged @entity0 at a court in @entity9 deliberation : judge @entity36 listens to arguments today as legal teams debate the sanity of @entity0			1

aspergers : @entity0 reacted with anger at claims he was suffering mental illness , saying that the testimony of @entity47 was ' insulting ' ' in the beginning i was quite offended , but in the end i thought it was pretty funny			1
the premises outlined are not true			0
' the 33 - year - old extremist has instructed his lawyers to fight for him to be declared sane , even though this would mean he spends the next 21 years in prison , rather than in a secure mental hospital			0
as he has confessed to killing 77 people during his massacre last july , his sanity is the key question at the trial			0
professor @entity10 argued that @entity0 did not appear to suffer from the absurd , bizarre delusions or hallucinations normal for a schizophrenic , so he did not agree with the conclusions of the first psychiatic report received by the court , which concluded he was insane			2
but he agreed that @entity0 could not be treated as responsible for his actions , contradicting a second psychiatric report , which argued @entity0 was criminally accountable			2
@entity81 said : ' it is important that we take on board that this is something much more than only a pure right - wing extremist			0
' it is a tragedy for @entity1 , and for us			0
but i believe it is also a tragedy for @entity0			2
the first time i saw @entity0 coming into the hall , i did not see a monster			2
i saw a deeply lonely man			1
' he said that @entity3 's would explain the problems @entity0 's mother had with her son when he was four years old , leading the two of them to spend several months staying at @entity1 's @entity101 for @entity102			1
@entity0 's mother , @entity103 , has also described him as being constantly thirsty , a symptom @entity47 said was frequently displayed by young @entity3 's sufferers			1
@entity0 's violent acts could also be the result of a version of @entity14 's syndrome , which is associated with @entity3 's			1
he said had observed that @entity0 suffered frequent suppressed tics			0

@entity1 's @entity141 newspaper was forced to publish an official apology in february , after it failed to make this clear			0
