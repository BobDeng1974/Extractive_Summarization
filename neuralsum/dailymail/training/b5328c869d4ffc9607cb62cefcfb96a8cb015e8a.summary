he built the robots along with his son , and drum pads , percussion instruments and synthesizers			1
' my passion for the @entity13 world was born in the early 70 's when i was a child and the bricks had just arrived @entity6 , ' he said			0
' i have re-discovered the passion for it with my son @entity44 , a big collector of vintage @entity13 - and the @entity46 team is part of his world			0
' ' @entity49 ( sonic factory in english ) is the name of my lab near @entity54			0
' the band is controlled by an @entity56 , while a small computer called an @entity58 converts the singals from the @entity56 into ' hit 's on the robot 's arms			1
