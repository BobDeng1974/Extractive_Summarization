the @entity3 has concluded that the @entity5 , @entity6 , police department routinely engages in racially biased practices , a law enforcement official familiar with the department 's findings said on tuesday			1
the investigation into the police department began in august after the shooting of unarmed african - american teen @entity11 by a white police officer in @entity5 sparked national protests			1
analysis of more than 35,000 pages of police records found racist comments from officers as well as statistics that showed african - americans make up 93 percent of arrests while accounting for only 67 percent of the population in @entity5 , the official said			1
the full report will be publicly released march 4 african - americans also made up most of incidents in which officers used force and all incidents where police dogs bit citizens , said the official , who asked not to be named because of the sensitive nature of the investigation			1
@entity42 protests of police actions that resulted in deaths of @entity45 in @entity5 , @entity46 and @entity47 laid bare racial tensions and what president @entity49 called ' simmering distrust ' between police and communities			1
the scathing report will show that 88 per cent of people against whom police used excessive force were african - americans , and victims of the 14 dog bites recorded by the department all were black			1
@entity3 staff interviewed hundreds of average citizens as part of the six - month probe , concluding that a large portion of @entity5 's population mistrusts the local police force and considers it illegitimate report will show that 88 per cent of people against whom police used excessive force were @entity45 black offenders are also less likely to have their cases dismissed by a municipal judge and they are more likely to be taken into custody on outstanding warrants during traffic stops , compared to their white counterparts			1
@entity5 's black residents are also more likely than others to be charged with relatively minor offenses like ' manner of walking in roadway ' or ' failure to comply			0
the findings are expected to be formally released as early as wednesday , a @entity3 spokeswoman said			1
the department will use the findings to negotiate policy changes with @entity5 officials and enter a consent decree , or to sue the city to force change			2
previous federal investigations into police departments have resulted in such changes as reporting arrest data to the @entity3 and installing federal monitors to oversee operations			2
@entity3 officials found from 2012 to 2014 that black motorists in @entity5 , @entity6 , were more than twice as likely as whites to be searched in traffic stops , even though they were 26 per cent less likely to be found carrying contraband			1
african - americans were 68 per cent less likely than others to have their cases dismissed by a municipal court judge			1
and from april to september of last year , 95 per cent of people kept at the city jail for more than two days were black , the six - month inquiry found			1
of the cases in which the police department documented the use of force , 88 per cent involved blacks , and victims of the 14 dog bites recorded by the department all were black			1
overall , @entity45 make up 67 per cent of the population of @entity5 , about 10 miles north of downtown @entity123			2
the report 's findings vindicate critics who have cited a pattern of abuse in @entity5			0
but they are unlikely to restore full trust in the @entity5 police by citizens who were angered when a grand jury decided not to indict @entity11 's killer , officer @entity133			0
@entity133 , who said he acted in self - defense , is also unlikely to face criminal charges in a separate @entity3 investigation			2
mayor @entity137 said @entity5 was committed to making improvements			0
' the city has always been committed to making sure we have the very best police department and any training and improvements or reforms we make to help improve service to the community , we are interested in , ' @entity137 said			2
civil rights attorney @entity147 , who has represented people who have clashed with @entity5 police and city officials , said he was not surprised by the findings , and he hopes to see @entity5 police chief @entity152 fired			1
' we already knew all this was going on			0
the problem is nobody is being prosecuted , nobody has been terminated , ' @entity154 said			0
@entity152 did not respond to a request for comment			0
one email sent by a @entity5 police or municipal court official joked in 2008 that @entity49 would not stay in office long because , ' what black man holds a steady job for four years ? ' another electronic missive , written in 2011 , included an offensive joke : ' an @entity45 - @entity45 woman in @entity169 was admitted into the the hospital for a pregnancy termination			1
two weeks later she received a check for $ 5,000			0
she phoned the hospital to ask who it was from			0
the hospital said , ' @entity177			0
'' @entity179 @entity178 said she was outraged by that and other racially tinged emails found in the investigation			0
biased : the investigation found @entity5 officers too often charged blacks with petty offenses ' the fact that police officers and municipal court officials are using their public emails to tell racial jokes , that just reeks of arrogance and ignorance , ' said @entity178			1
they think they are untouchable			0
the taxpayers have been paying for that racial bias			0
' the official said that in @entity5 's court system , african - americans were less likely to have their cases dismissed by a municipal judge and made up 95 percent of people held longer than two days in the @entity5 jail			1
the @entity207 , which attorney general @entity208 has previously criticized for unfairly penalizing the city 's poor , issued the majority of its warrants for minor violations such as parking , traffic and housing code violations			1
the physical tussle that led to @entity11 's death began after @entity133 told him and a friend to move from the street to the sidewalk			0
a separate report to be issued soon is expected to clear @entity133 of federal civil rights charges			2
@entity224 , the attorney for the @entity11 family , said that if the reports about the findings are true , they ' confirm what @entity11 's family has believed all along , and that is that the tragic killing of an unarmed 18 - year - old black teenager was part of a systemic pattern of inappropriate policing of @entity45 - @entity45 citizens in the @entity5 community			1
' a separate report to be issued soon is expected to clear @entity5 police officer @entity133 of federal civil rights charges in the @entity11 killing the @entity3 report also will accuse the @entity123 suburb of putting profit over public safety in violation of the @entity247 's due process clause by collecting heavy fines from low - income residents			1
since 2010 , according to the federal agency , @entity5 courts have raked in more than $ 442,000 in fines for failure to appear , which amounted to a quarter of the court 's annual revenue , reported the @entity255			0
the onerous ' failure to appear ' charge , which disproportionately affected those living close to and below the poverty line , was dropped by the city in september			2
@entity3 staff had reviewed 35,000 pages of police records and interviewed hundreds of city officials and average citizens as part of the six - month probe , concluding that a large portion of @entity5 's population mistrusts the local police force and considers it illegitimate			1
in anticipation of the report 's release , @entity5 mayor @entity271 said monday that the outcome of the investigation was predetermined , according to @entity277			0
' i 'm not comfortable that @entity208 announced that there would be wholesale changes before he started collecting any evidence , '' @entity137 said			2
' if the @entity3 has some serious findings , i hope they will provide that to us			2
' @entity285 , a @entity123 community activist , praised the findings , saying ' @entity5 police have to see the light in how they deal with people of color			2
' it 's quite evident that change is coming down the pike			0
this is encouraging , ' he said			0
' it 's so unfortunate that @entity11 had to be killed			0
but in spite of that , i feel justice is coming			0

a *message* in a municipal email account said @entity49 would *n't* be president for very long because ' what black man holds a steady job for four years '
