by @entity0 the 3,500 servicemen now drafted in to bolster security during @entity3 will be forced to camp in disused buildings			1
derelict schools , warehouses , factories and hospitals near the @entity9 could be commandeered to give them somewhere to sleep			1
many personnel – some only just back from gruelling tours on the @entity15 front line – have been ordered to cancel home leave or holidays with their friends and families			1
about 1,000 will be flown in from @entity20			2
a soldier on duty at the olympic park in @entity24 on thursday			2
he 'll soon be joined by 3,500 other troops they will join 13,500 soldiers , sailors , airmen and @entity30 already deployed to protect the @entity31 against a terrorist atrocity			1
the 17,000 force is greater than that fighting the @entity35			2
and the decision to fill the shortfall of civilian guards left by @entity39 has left a massive headache for defence chiefs who have to find temporary accommodation for them all			2
some will camp in a tented ‘ city ’ within @entity44			2
it is understood camps will be erected inside @entity47 near @entity48 and at the @entity50 base at @entity51			0
but a @entity53 source said the ‘ favoured option ’ was to find disused buildings large enough to house vast numbers of troops			1
‘ we are looking at industrial buildings , disused office blocks , disused schools			1
that is the most likely option			0
the conditions will be pretty austere but troops are more than used to making the best out of spartan conditions			1
’ home secretary @entity67 was forced to plead with the @entity68 for help with security during the @entity31 to add insult to injury , home secretary @entity67 rewarded troops who have had leave cancelled with tickets to the dress rehearsal of the opening and closing ceremonies			1
she was criticised for failing to allow servicemen and women who were bailing her out to watch the real thing while mps get free tickets for the blue riband 100 metres final			0
around 5,000 extra tickets were made available for the practices , making a total of 7,000			0
one serving military officer said : ‘ a lot of soldiers have had to cancel well - earned holidays with their loved ones to help dig @entity67 and the @entity31 organisers out of this fiasco			1
it ’s a bit condescending to say to them , “ here are some tickets to thank you – but , sorry , they ’re not for the proper opening and closing ceremonies			0
i wonder how many @entity83 will be watching the dress rehearsals and how many will be watching the real thing			0
’ the government has already announced 10,000 tickets are available for the @entity107 under the tickets for troops scheme			1
among the soldiers called up to rescue @entity31 security are those serving with the @entity112 , the @entity113 the @entity114 , which was axed as a fighting force just days ago in defence cuts			0
soldiers begin installing a battery of surface - to - air missiles on the roof of the @entity122 council block in @entity123 , @entity44 , to protect against an @entity31 terror attack from the sky the men of the 131 - year - old unit are already reeling from the demoralising news that it will be reduced next year to ceremonial duties			0
personnel who had already been allocated to the @entity31 were to do 12 - hour shifts on six - day cycles for three months , with one day a week off			0
many of the jobs involve checking bags , tickets and vehicles			0
defence secretary @entity139 said : ‘ ministers across government recognise the burden that this additional short - notice deployment will impose upon servicemen and women and their families , especially over the summer holiday season			0
‘ we will ensure that all those taking part receive their full leave entitlement , that no one is out of pocket due to cancelled personal arrangements and that all deployed personnel are appropriately supported			2

disused schools and warehouses could be commandeered
many troops just back from @entity15 will have to cancel leave
