politicians are criss - crossing the country wooing voters ahead of the election in 27 days ’ time			2
but in more than half of seats the result is already known , according to new analysis of safe seats			1
more than 25million live in constituencies where the result can already be predicted , because one party is so far ahead			1
there are 650 seats up for grabs on may 7 , with @entity16 and the @entity17 needing more than half to secure a majority			1
however , the @entity19 claims the result in 364 seats can be called now , based on current polls and how ‘ safe ’ they were in 2010			1
the @entity32 are defending 56 seats , of which only seven are considered safe , after a dramatic collapse in their poll ratings since joining the coalition with the @entity17			1
some parts of the country are more likely to play a role in deciding the outcome of the election than others			0
for example , 70 per cent of seats in the @entity25 are considered safe , compared to 10 per cent in @entity26 , where the @entity27 is expected to make sweeping gains			1
the @entity19 has produced a new online tool for voters to see if they live in an area where the election result will be decided			1
it is campaigning for a change to the voting system , arguing that @entity52 , where the winning candidate just needs to get the most votes , fails to take account of the changing face of @entity58 politics			0
of 303 @entity17 seats , 186 are considered safe while 151 of @entity16 ’s 257 constituencies are not expected to change @entity59 are defending 56 seats , of which only seven are considered safe , after a dramatic collapse in their poll ratings since joining the coalition with the @entity17 based on the 2010 election result , @entity64 needs to win another 23 more seats to secure a majority in the @entity68 , while @entity69 needs at least 70			1
@entity70 is defending 56 seats , but is braced for heavy losses the @entity17 need to win only 23 more seats to obtain a majority in the @entity68 , while @entity16 need 70			2
the polls suggests it could take three or more parties to form a majority , including the @entity27 , @entity32 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80			2
@entity81 , chief executive of the @entity19 , said : ‘ the fact that we can firmly predict the outcome of over half of the seats being contested this may is a sorry indictment of our outdated voting system			1
“ the average constituency has n’t changed hands since the 1960s , and some have been under the same party ’s control since the reign of @entity96			2
this is a huge disincentive for people to get out there and vote , and for other parties to challenge incumbents			0
we have a system which actively discourages voters and parties from taking part			0
“ we urgently need a fairer electoral system to give voice to the many millions of people in safe seats who are not being heard			2
“ predicting the winners in a majority of seats should n’t be possible in a truly dynamic and modern democracy			0
but sadly that ’s exactly what we ’ve been able to do			0
the @entity58 needs a fair voting system to bring our politics into the 21st century and give us a @entity119 that actually reflects people ’s wishes			0
” as part of the 2010 coalition agreement , the @entity32 and @entity17 held a referendum on changing the voting system to the @entity126 , which allows voters to give their first and second choice of candidate			0
the winner is the first candidate to get over 50 per cent of the vote			0
however , in the referendum in 2011 it was roundly defeated when 67.9 per cent voted against it .			0
