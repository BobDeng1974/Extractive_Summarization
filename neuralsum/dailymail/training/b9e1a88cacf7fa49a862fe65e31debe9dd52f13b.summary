@entity1 's mass manipulation of almost 700,000 users has caused uproar - and today @entity4 was forced admit it was a mistake			1
however , a @entity6 - based artist and programmer has built a tool that allows you to see it for yourself - and run @entity1 ’s controversial mood experiment on your own news feed			1
when the @entity15 is installed , a small white box will appear in the top right corner of the @entity26			0
it contains a set of sliding scales labeled with four emotions : positive , emotional , aggressive , and open			1
above the scales the @entity15 prompts , ' how would you like to feel ? ' users can slide the scales back and forth and watch how their feed is affected in real - time			2
for instance , sliding the ' emotional ' scale all the way to the right yields more photos of weddings and babies			0
maxing out the ' aggressive ' filter can lead to a feed peppered with politically oriented posts and news of a gun showdown in @entity46			1
the ' @entity15 ' is a simple browser extension that lets you select how you want to feel and filters your @entity49 accordingly			1
@entity50 , the mastermind behind the project , built the tool in response to @entity1 ’s research into massive - scale emotional contagion			1

' you adjust the settings and it ’s not immediately clear what ’s changed , ' @entity50 explained to @entity81 ' however , you slowly realize that these posts do have an effect on you			0
it ’s not about turning your feed into a sunshine stream			0
' but you can set this button , totally forget about it , and have a totally different experience on @entity1 that ’s not explicitly clear to you , but is implicitly affecting you			2

maxing out the ' aggressive ' and ' @entity95 ' filters can lead to a feed peppered with politically oriented posts and sad news sad @entity1 feed : altering the filter ratios will display different types of posts			1
maxing out the ' aggressive ' and ' @entity95 ' filters can lead to a feed peppered with politically oriented posts and sad news the @entity15 even uses @entity103 ( @entity104 ) , the same system used in the @entity1 study , to evaluate phrasing in each @entity1 post			1
@entity50 says she saw the @entity1 study , but wanted to make the implications more tangible			1
' why should @entity110 get to decide how you feel ? ' she writes on her website , ' take back control … manipulate your emotions on your terms			0
' @entity1 has publicly apologized for such manipulations			0
the @entity118 - based firm carried out the experiment during a week in 2012			1
during that time , negative posts were deprioritized in the data feeds of 689,003 users , to see if it generated a more positive response			1
posts were determined by the experiment to be positive or negative if they contained at least one positive or negative word			1
the experiment affected around 0.04 per cent of users - or 1 in 2500			0
according to @entity1 , nobody 's posts were ' hidden , ' they just did n't show up on some feeds			1
it found that negative posts elicited a swell of positive responses , but also that a reduction in positive news led to more negative posts			1
‘ when positive expressions were reduced , people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts ; when negative expressions were reduced , the opposite pattern occurred , ’ said the researchers			1
the company issued a statement last week claiming it ' never met to upset anyone ' by altering the feeds of almost 700,000 users , adding , ' the research benefits of the paper may not have justified all of this			1
' today , while on a visit to @entity152 , @entity1 coo @entity4 admitted that experiment was ' poorly communicated , ' marking the first public statement on the study by a @entity1 executive since the outrage erupted			0
' this was part of ongoing research companies do to test different products , and that was what it was ; it was poorly communicated , and for that communication we apologize			0
we never meant to upset you , ' she told the @entity167			0
during one week in 2012 , @entity1 manipulated feeds of just over 689,000 users to highlight either positive or negative items , and then monitored responses over the course of a random week			1
the site has since apologised for the way the paper described the research , and any anxiety that was caused ‘ the reason we did this research is because we care about the emotional impact of @entity1 and the people that use our product , ' said @entity1 data scientist @entity184			2
‘ we felt that it was important to investigate the common worry that seeing friends post positive content leads to people feeling negative or left out			0
‘ at the same time , we were concerned that exposure to friends ' negativity might lead people to avoid visiting @entity1			0
' we did n't clearly state our motivations in the paper			0
' having written and designed this experiment myself , i can tell you that our goal was never to upset anyone			0
' during the experiment , @entity1 deprioritized content in users ' @entity203 , based on whether there was an emotional word in the post			1
tests affected around 0.04 per cent of users - or 1 in 2500 - for a week , in early 2012			2
according to @entity184 , no posts were ' hidden , ' they just did n't show up in certain users ' feeds			2
' those posts were always visible on friends ' timelines , and could have shown up on subsequent @entity26 loads , ' he explained			0
the study found that negative posts elicited a swell of positive responses , but also that a reduction in positive news led to more negative posts			1
‘ when positive expressions were reduced , people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts ; when negative expressions were reduced , the opposite pattern occurred , ’ said the researchers			1
‘ these results indicate that emotions expressed by others on @entity1 influence our own emotions , constituting experimental evidence for massive - scale contagion via social networks			2
’ of the millions of posts analyzed , 4 million were found to be positive and 1.8million were determined to be negative			2
the findings led the team to conclude that ‘ in - person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion			0
’ this experiment was limited to users who viewed @entity1 in @entity247 , but it is not known across which geographic boundaries			2
' at the end of the day , the actual impact on people in the experiment was the minimal amount to statistically detect it - the result was that people produced an average of one fewer emotional word , per thousand words , over the following week , ' continued @entity184			0
' i can understand why some people have concerns about it , and my coauthors and i are very sorry for the way the paper described the research and any anxiety it caused			0
' commenting on the reports , @entity268 , director of the digital marketing agency @entity270 , said : ' despite @entity1 's insistence this was merely an academic experiment , it sails perilously close to the illegal world of subliminal advertising			2
' there 's a reason this insidious form of manipulation is banned - it is an abuse of people 's freedom to choose			0
' ' but let 's keep some perspective , ' he added ' this was a research project , not the birth of some social media thought police			0
