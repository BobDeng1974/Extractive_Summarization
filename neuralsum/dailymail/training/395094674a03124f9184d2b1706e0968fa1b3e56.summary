after a long and distinguished international career with @entity2 , @entity0 knows what it takes to reach a @entity6 final			1
@entity0 was in the 2002 team , a beaten finalist in @entity8 as @entity10 ’s side came up against the brilliance of the @entity14 ronaldo			1
the former @entity16 and @entity17 midfielder has been monitoring the progress of @entity20 ’s team in @entity14 , but is n’t convinced they have the qualities to reach the final			1
@entity2 play their second - round clash against @entity26 on monday evening , but the route to the final is treacherous			2
@entity0 is not the type to get carried away by some good form in the group phase			2
written off : this is the worst @entity33 team for a decade claims @entity0 past experience : @entity0 ( r ) was part of the @entity33 team to reach the final of the 2002 @entity6 he said : ‘ i ’m still cautious about @entity2 because in the previous three tournaments they had better teams than this one and did n’t win any of them			1
‘ @entity44 has had a lot of problems with injuries and if he does n’t perform then @entity2 can not win the @entity6 - it really is as simple as that			1
‘ if you look at the bench they have no experience			0
they have a team with six or seven players with less than five caps each			0
‘ they have options with @entity59 and @entity60 , but they are missing the @entity62 twins			0
‘ this is a difficult tournament for @entity2 to win because their route to the final is probably @entity67 , then @entity14 , then @entity68 or @entity69 in the @entity70			1
‘ it is seven games of high intensity and the players have to perform at their very best			0
‘ look at @entity75 - he is 22 years old and everyone in @entity14 is putting pressure on him to win the @entity6 and he has to handle that after a very difficult first season with @entity79			1
’ video @entity80 : @entity0 walking wounded : @entity2 will struggle to win with @entity44 injured @entity0 is also convinced that @entity20 is indulging the captain @entity81 after moving him into a screening role in front of @entity2 ’s back four			1
@entity81 was converted from full - back at @entity86 when @entity87 arrived at the @entity88 last summer and he was used in the role in their opening three group games			2
@entity0 , who played 59 times for @entity2 , added : ‘ @entity81 wants to play in the centre because that ’s where he has been playing his club football with @entity86			1
‘ he should be playing at full - back , which is his best position			2
@entity81 has only been playing for six or seven months in a new position , but it ’s not enough time to learn it			1
‘ it is staggering that he is playing there after just a few months in the role with @entity86			0
‘ @entity86 have 75 per cent possession in most of their games , but it is different playing for the national team in that role			2
he has made it clear to the coach he wants to play there , so now they are playing with two central defenders at full back			0
’ @entity115 and @entity116 have filled the full back positions in the group stage as @entity2 beat @entity119 4 - 0 , drew 2 - 2 with @entity120 and finished with a 1 - 0 win against @entity122			2
out of place : @entity81 has been played in midfield by @entity2 coach @entity20 clinical : @entity126 has scored four goals at the @entity6 so far up front they are fearless and @entity126 ’s good form at @entity130 continued with a hat - trick against @entity119 and a crisp , curled strike against @entity134 ’s @entity122 team in the final group game			1
@entity0 added : ‘ @entity126 is a clinical finisher playing in a team that creates a lot chances - you could see that with his goal against @entity122			1
' he is a very clever player			0
his biggest asset is his pace and finishing			0
he is not the most gifted player , but i think his best position is up top because he is such a goal threat			0
’ impossible : @entity147 will not be observing @entity148 during the tournament @entity150 with tough decision to make on sunday , @entity33 midfielder @entity147 revealed that he would not be observing the strict @entity153 religious laws after @entity148 began on saturday			1
‘ it will be impossible for me to take part , ’ admitted the @entity155 midfielder ahead of monday 's second - round clash			0
many of @entity26 ’s players will be fasting and are using a sports medicine expert to ensure that the squad ’s preparations are not affected			0
@entity2 were stunned at the 1982 @entity6 in @entity164 , losing 2 - 1 to @entity26 in their opener , but they took shameful revenge			2
a 1 - 0 or 2 - 0 win over @entity168 in the final group match would see both progress and @entity26 go out			0
the @entity33 went ahead — and both teams virtually stopped trying			0
@entity33 goalkeeper @entity172 and @entity174 striker @entity173 are pictured having a friendly word at the game ’s conclusion .			0

@entity0 does not think @entity2 will reach @entity6 final
former @entity16 midfielder claims it 's the worst team for a decade
