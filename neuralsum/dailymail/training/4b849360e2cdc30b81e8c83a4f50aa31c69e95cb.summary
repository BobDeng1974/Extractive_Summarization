by @entity0 published : 10:33 est , 13 march 2014 updated : 13:49 est , 13 march 2014 racegoers will today be hoping for the luck of the @entity4 as the @entity5 celebrates @entity6 four days early			1
spectators were a sea of emerald green as they descended on @entity10 , with @entity12 hats and even @entity14 fairy outfits dotted among the crowd			2
the look is a far cry from @entity18 yesterday , which saw racegoers clad in fur , feathers and tailored tweed descend on the historic race course , where the public were joined by the @entity25 , her son @entity29 , along with new mother @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28			0
one lady worked the green theme of the day in a fashion - conscious manner , teaming a tailored emerald jacket with an elaborate peacock fascinator hat @entity36 ( left ) and @entity37 from @entity38 arrive for @entity6 at @entity39 in their @entity14 themed get up - complete with four leaf clover stockings and green bow ties @entity12 o'clock ! not everyone adopted the @entity14 theme today , with many simply choosing to enjoy a beer in celebration a racegoer celebrates as her horse , @entity50 , wins the @entity52 ' @entity51 @entity53 , from @entity54 , paired her green four leaf clover fairy wings with an all - in - one outfit , including a fur bowler hat and @entity14 flag however the jovial mood of the crowd today is much the same as the high spirits seen at the first two days , as visitors soak in the atmosphere and indulge in a few beers			1
also similar to tuesday and wednesday is the numbers taking advantage of @entity39 ’s considerably more lax dress code than its @entity70 cousin @entity71			0
as well as green body suits and fairy wings , some young ladies chose to wear some very mini skirts			0
seemingly carrying a memento of every equestrian event he has ever attended , the unnamed man has a collection that reaches down past his stomach the jovial mood embraced by the eager crowd today is much the same as the high spirits seen at the first two days of the festival lady race goers change shoes before entering the race course , strapping on some sky high heels , despite their rather short skirts the racecourse was ablaze with green today as @entity39 celebrates @entity6 , despite the official date being monday 17 these enthusiasts broke away from the @entity12 hats , choosing ones adorned with buckles and bells instead teamed with four - leaf clover over the knee socks , oversized green bow ties or a fur trimmed bright green bowler hat , subtly was clearly not the aim of the game for some			1
and while it was mainly the women leading the way in the outlandish fashion stakes , with most men making do with a @entity12 top hat as a nod to the @entity14 theme , one gentleman was the subject of some double takes as he arrived with hundreds of race passes across the country attached to his binoculars			0
as well as those who chose to honour the @entity14 theme , there were many who kept to the more traditional fashions of @entity39 , with some top to toe fur making an appearance @entity125 remained popular among racegoers on day three of the @entity5 one racegoer decidedly bucks today 's green colour scheme in a bold red dress with matching lipstick ( right ) , while another opts for canary yellow ( left ) visitors soak in the atmosphere and indulge in a few beers at one of the biggest events in the annual racing calendar one spectator keeps things traditional and elegant in tailored tweed ( right ) , while another lady takes a funky twist on the normal look with a patterned coat , bright blue cuffs , and trilby feathered hat ( left ) seemingly carrying a memento of every equestrian event he has ever attended , the unnamed man has a collection that reaches down past his stomach			1
today features plenty of @entity14 - style entertainment at @entity39 including the @entity156 , a charity flat race which raises money for @entity159			1
over the last three years , in excess of £ 840,000 has been raised at the festival and the charity race will once again be taking place as the centrepiece of the fundraising on @entity156 ’s thursday			0
the grey skies have n't lessened the fun or nail - biting racing today , with tomorrow promising more nerve wracking riding on @entity170 racegoers queue up to collect their winnings as the races end on this , the third day of the historic festival @entity176 celebrates atop horse @entity177 after their win in the third race today minutes earlier @entity29 was watched by the crowds as he rode @entity177 to win the @entity182 @entity183 riding @entity184 ( centre ) clear the last to win the @entity52 ' @entity51 the theme of the day did not detract from the drama and excitement of the races , which today features a race to raise money for @entity159 @entity192 celebrates on @entity193 after winning the @entity194 earlier today chief executive of @entity182 @entity196 in the parade ring			2
@entity182 have sponsored the @entity182 today the crowd today can barely be seen beneath the sea of @entity12 top hats that adorn the heads of many spectators many today will be hoping for the luck of the @entity4 as they place their bets on the seven events running today top titfers : glamorous hats were all over the racecourse at @entity5 today with everything from dainty pillboxes to pheasant feathered fascinators on display they came bearing binoculars , their tweed coats and shiny patent leather boots accessorised with glamorous diamond studs and ropes of pearls as racing got underway on @entity18 at the @entity5			2
others sported vast fur cossack hats of the sort beloved of @entity225 , while more still embraced jaunty headgear inspired by the glorious surrounding countryside and festooned with @entity229 blooms and pheasant feathers			0
but while some got the look spot on , others appeared to have taken the country chic look too far with a bizarre @entity237 - inspired ensemble complete with leather gauntlets and a set of bottom - scraping tweed minis among the low points			0
colourful : @entity243 - who attended today too - shows off her elaborately decorated straw top hat which came complete with a bouquet of straw roses and a huge spray of feathers short and not so sweet : a pair of racegoers take the country dressing theme a little too far while another trio of girls seem to have forgotten their coats colourful : a racegoer shows off her fur cossack hat and matching collar as she arrives at @entity39 , while another plumps for a mauve ensemble cosy : this well - wrapped racegoer was resplendent in a warm - looking fur hat which she accessorised with a matching scarf and an inky fur coat style statement : @entity267 from @entity268 opts for striking head - to - toe print while @entity270 from @entity271 combines a fur bolero with a fabulous hat inspired by the @entity237 ? a racing aficionado sports an ensemble complete with leather gauntlets watch out @entity277 ! a leopard loving lady seems to have been inspired by @entity280 unusual : a lady sporting a bizarre ensemble that includes a fur hat and tippet @entity285 is the other way ! a gentleman in an eye - catching crimson suit and matching bow tie pauses for a photo as he makes his way into the course not so good : @entity39 does encourage fancy dress , which is perhaps what inspired this look ( left )			1
