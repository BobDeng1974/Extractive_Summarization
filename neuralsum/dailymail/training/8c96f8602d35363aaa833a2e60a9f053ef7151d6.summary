but @entity5 's team eventually dropped her from the witness list after she failed to show on a couple of occasions in the current trial @entity15 took the witness stand in the trial of three former @entity5 aides charged with recruiting her and other women for prostitution @entity35 's testimony friday confirmed the sexual atmosphere at @entity5 's infamous ' bunga bunga ' parties , which were filled with beautiful young women			1
the trial is separate from the one in which @entity5 is charged with paying for sex with a minor and trying to cover it up many of those women have said they received money from the billionaire media mogul			1
dressed soberly with her hair pulled back , @entity35 said she first made contact with @entity5 's inner circle when she participated in a beauty contest organized by @entity44 in @entity98 when she was 16			2
after that she made her way to @entity67 , hoping to find work			2
she said she tried to get work through another defendant 's talent agency but wound up landing a job as a hostess in nightclubs , earning around 100 euros a night			0
eventually , she ran into @entity44 at a restaurant , where she reminded him of his promise in @entity98 to help her			0
shortly thereafter , she was invited to a dinner party - at @entity5 's villa outside of @entity67			1
she testified that she met the premier that night - on @entity114 in 2010 - and that he gave her an envelope of 2,000 to 3,000 euros , saying it was ' a little help ' and asking for her telephone number , which she gave him			2
at that party , she said , she introduced herself as @entity36 and told other guests a fake tale that she was @entity122 , that her mother was a famous @entity124 singer and that she was related to then - @entity122 president @entity125			0
she was 17 at the time but had passed herself off as being 24			0
party girl : @entity129 entrepreneur @entity128 dancing with @entity36 at the traditional @entity130 in 2011 @entity35 confirmed friday what other witnesses have testified previously : that at some of the soirees , young female party guests had dressed up like nuns and danced for @entity5 and then stripped down to their underwear			2
@entity35 said @entity47 , one of the defendants , had dressed up like a nun at that february 14 party and lifted her costume to show off her legs as she danced in @entity5 's in - house disco , which was outfitted with a lap - dance pole			2
@entity35 demonstrated from her seat how @entity47 had raised her hemline			0
she said @entity47 eventually took off her costume and was in just her lingerie			0
she said other girls dressed up as president @entity148 and a @entity67 magistrate who is leading the prosecution against @entity5 in the sex scandal			1
the showgirl @entity152 dressed up in an @entity148 mask with a shirt and pants on and performed a dance			0
' the girls who were dressed in costumes approached him in a sensual way as they danced			0
they raised their skirts , ' @entity35 testified			0
she added : ' i never saw contact			0
' @entity35 said she visited @entity5 's mansion , @entity166 , a half - dozen times , and that each time she was given an envelope with money , always in 500 euro bills			2
the second evening she went she said she was given around 2,000 euros			0
exotic dancer : @entity174 party girl @entity36 the @entity172 aka @entity15 testified that at least woman at a @entity5 party was dressed up as @entity148 prosecutors in @entity5 's separate trial have said @entity35 's testimony is unreliable and are relying on her sworn statements			1
the defense had initially called her as a witness , but then changed its strategy and did n't call her			0
that trial is nearing a verdict			0
last week photos of the @entity6 prime minister 's underground @entity174 room were revealed as the trial for having sex with underage prostitutes carried on			2
the infamous room was allegedly used to hold erotic parties at which women performed stripteases and were paid for sex , though @entity5 denies that it was used for anything so risque			1
at the time miss @entity15 , also known as @entity36 the @entity198 , was just 17 and technically a minor			1
in @entity6 the age of consent is 14 , but paying a woman under the age of 18 for sex is seen as a criminal offence			2
@entity5 and miss @entity15 have always insisted nothing untoward happened at the parties and he has also stressed they were nothing more than elegant dinners - a claim he returned to in his tv interview given to @entity211 5 one of the channels the media tycoon owns			1
he has always insisted he is the the victim of left leaning prosecutors and judges who are politically motivated and out to get him in the various trials he has faced , which have cost him millions of @entity217 in legal fees			0
at the last count there had been more than 2,500 court hearings against him in which he was accused of crimes ranging from @entity224 collusion , false accounting , tax fraud , bribery , corruption and perverting the course of justice			0
so far none have actually ended with him being convicted indefinitely - in @entity6 a verdict is not final until it has reached the third and final stage at the @entity234 in @entity235			0
earlier this month a conviction for tax fraud was upheld against him and this now passes to the @entity234 which will rule if the four year jail sentence should be enforced			0
in the @entity67 trial he is currently involved in , @entity5 is accused of paying for sex with a minor and abuse of office , as prosecutors claim he told police miss @entity15 was related to former @entity122 president @entity246 and should be released after she was arrested on a theft charge			1
prosecutors say that miss @entity15 was one of dozens of tv showgirls and wannabe starlets who were paid with cash , jewellery and cars to attend the parties and perform erotic dances and strip teases for @entity5			1
@entity174 time : the underground room in @entity5 's villa where he held his infamous parties photographs have been published in @entity6 newspapers and magazines of women dressed a nuns and police officers dancing provocatively at the parties which @entity5 hosted at his villa at @entity166 near @entity67			1
if convicted of the sex charge , he faces three years in jail and for the public office he could be given 12 years			0
@entity5 stepped down as pm two years ago as @entity6 verged on the brink of a financial crisis , but mounted a spirited campaign in the recent general election which saw him come second to the centre left			2
his @entity276 is now part of the ruling coalition .			0
