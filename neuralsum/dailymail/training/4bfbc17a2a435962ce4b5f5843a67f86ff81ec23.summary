president @entity0 and his wife @entity1 are on the lookout for minimum - wage jobs for their teenage daughters so they can give them a feeling of what ' most folks go through every single day			1
' ' we are looking for opportunities for them to feel as if going to work and getting a paycheck is not always fun , not always stimulating , not always fair , ' the president said in an interview with @entity15 , slated to run on sunday			1
' i think every kid needs to get a taste of what it 's like to do that real hard work , ' @entity1 echoed			2
instilling good values ? president @entity0 and his wife @entity1 are on the lookout for minimum - wage jobs for their teenage daughters , for them to get a sense of what ' most folks go through every day ' both the president and the first lady worked minimum - wage jobs before they got law degrees : an experience they said they also want their teenage daughters - @entity36 , 16 , and @entity37 , who turned 13 this month - to share			1
the president scooped ice cream at @entity40 , waited tables at an assisted - living facility for seniors and also worked as a painter			1
the first lady worked at a book binding shop			1
it is unclear what sort of careers paths @entity36 and @entity37 have their eyes set on beyond their destined minimum wage experiences , but @entity36 was recently spotted on the set of a @entity54 television program , working as a production assistant for a day			1
given that the president and the first lady have kept an eagle eyed watch on their daughters since they entered the @entity61 , shielding them from public scrutiny as much as possible , it also remains unclear how they propose to land them jobs among the ' normal folk ' @entity0 refers to			1
straight talking : @entity0 , pictured with @entity36 , 16 , ( left ) and @entity37 , 13 , ( right ) , is keen for his daughters to learn that ' getting a paycheck is not always fun , not always stimulating , not always fair ' humble beginnings : @entity1 ( left ) worked at a book binding job in her youth , while her husband scooped ice cream , waited tables , and worked as a painter in the interview , the @entity36 also talked about how , for a year after law school , they lived with mrs @entity81 's mom , @entity80 , on the second floor of her house , drove a used car that they bought for $ 1,000 , and worked through the stress of being saddled with student loans and small children			1
' getting a paycheck is not always fun , not always stimulating , not always fair ' they acknowledged that their careers gave them the chance to earn good incomes and negotiate family leave when they needed it - a luxury that most minimum - wage workers do not have			2
' but what it made me think about was people who were on the clock , ' the president said			0
' if you 're an hourly worker in most companies , and you say , " i 've got to take three days off , " you may lose your job			0
at minimum , you 're losing income you ca n't afford to lose			0
' giving back : earlier this year , the president took @entity37 ( right ) with him to participate in a community service project at the @entity112 the @entity36 gave the interview to promote a summit the @entity61 is holding on monday to discuss policies to help working families			1
' there are structures that can help families around child care , healthcare , and schooling that make an enormous difference in people 's lives , ' @entity0 said in the interview			2
this year , the president has tried to focus on issues such as ensuring equal pay for women , expanding early childhood education and hiking the minimum wage			0
these issues so far have failed to gain traction in @entity134 , but do resonate with @entity136 voters			0
to advance his agenda , he needs @entity136 to keep control of the @entity140 after november 's midterm elections and regain control of the @entity143			0
' if we can highlight these issues and sustain it over the next year , it 's still possible to see bold action out of @entity134 , ' @entity0 said			0
@entity148 stand a good chance of taking away the @entity140 and are likely to keep the @entity61			0

' i did n’t separate , and @entity1 ’s point was , that ’s not laundry			2
' cleaning the bathroom was n't one of the president 's strengths , either			2
' i was usually the bill payer , the grocery shopper , and generally the dishwasher			0
