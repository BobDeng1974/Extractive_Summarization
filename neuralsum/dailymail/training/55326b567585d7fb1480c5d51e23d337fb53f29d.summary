i did n’t know what to do and i could n’t believe what was happening			0
' he came into the cubicle and this time he went straight for my pubic area - there was no messing around at all			1
' i did climax and he was aware of that because my body physically moved			0
that is when he said : “ now you are really relaxed ”			0
i did n’t know what to do			0
' i was just so frightened of making a fuss and making a scene			0
i did n’t know if i screamed what his reaction would be			0
' i trusted him and i trusted the fact that i was in a safe public space with someone i had been referred to by the @entity8			0
' but she was persuaded by police not to take mr @entity2 to trial because the stress of giving evidence in court would be too great			1
presenting officer @entity57 said : ' detective constable @entity58 said it was her word against his and the process of giving evidence in a criminal trial would be difficult			0

' trusted ' : the alleged incident took place at @entity76 , near @entity77 ' he told me the identity of the other woman and i could n’t understand why he did that			1
' he told me that the interview with her would not be valid evidence in court and so therefore it would be my word only against @entity2			1
' the cps were willing to take the case on and i had to go through with the decision to face mr @entity2 in court where i would probably find it very stressful			2
' i was advised that details would probably be made public - that there would be a chance that i would be made to look like i was compliant			0
i was advised that living in a very small community can have an effect			0
i decided that i could n’t go through with the stress of going to court			0
' the hearing was read the end of woman ’s police statement written up by @entity86			2
it ended by saying : ' all things considered i do n’t think i am strong enough to go through a court case			0

woman , *unnamed* for legal reasons , says she was touched in hospital
she claims @entity2 , 41 , touched ' pubic area ' and made her orgasm
he allegedly then told the patient : ' now you are really relaxed '
she allegedly went to police and was heard there were other complaints
but she was warned about effects of going to court , which *dissuaded* her
claims came to light in tribunal hearing over treatment at @entity76 in @entity78
