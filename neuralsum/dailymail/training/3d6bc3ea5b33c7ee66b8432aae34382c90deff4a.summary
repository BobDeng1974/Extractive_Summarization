by @entity0 published : 09:29 est , 1 march 2013 updated : 10:51 est , 1 march 2013 new research using brain scans sheds light on the way that the @entity6 's remarkable brain worked			1
scientists at @entity8 and @entity9 combined hospital mris with a mathematical tool called network analysis to make 3d maps of the brains of seven adults who have the same condition			1
these ' structural connectome ' maps , described in the upcoming april 15 issue of the journal @entity20 , reveal new details about the condition known as agenesis of the corpus callosum			2
immortalised on the silver screen : @entity26 , left , and @entity27 , right , in a frame from the @entity30 film @entity6 , which was based on @entity31 , a famous sufferer of agenesis of the corpus callosum this is where genetic malformations leave patients without a corpus callosum , the neurological structure that connects the left and right sides of the brain			1
that condition is one of the top genetic causes of autism and was part of the mysterious brain physiology of @entity31 , the remarkable savant portrayed by @entity27 in the 1987 movie @entity6			2
mr @entity31 , from @entity50 , who died in 2009 aged 58 , was known as a ' megasavant ' for his exceptional memory , but he also experienced significant social difficulties			0
he could speed through a book in about an hour and remember almost everything he had read , memorising vast amounts of information in subjects ranging from history and literature , geography and numbers to sports , music and dates			0
but while his amazing memory emerged as early as 16 months , he could not walk until the age of four , could not button up his own shirts and scored a below - average 87 on general iq tests			0
while some people born with agenesis of the corpus callosum are of normal intelligence and do not have any obvious signs of neurologic disease , approximately 40 per cent of people with the condition are at high risk for autism			1
@entity80 : @entity31 , who in 2009 , could speed through a book in about an hour and remember almost everything he had read but could not button up his own shirts and scored a below - average 87 on general iq tests given this , the work is a step toward finding better ways to image the brains of people with the condition , said dr @entity90 , a professor of radiology and biomedical imaging at @entity8			2
understanding how brain connectivity varies from person to person may help researchers identify imaging biomarkers for autism to help diagnose it and manage care for individuals			0
currently autism is diagnosed and assessed based on cognitive tests , such as those involving stacking blocks and looking at pictures on flip cards			0
while the new work falls short of a quantitative measure doctors could use instead of cognitive testing , it does offer a proof - of - principle that this novel technique may shed light on neurodevelopment disorders			2
' because you are looking at the whole brain at the network level , you can do new types of analysis to find what 's abnormal , ' dr @entity90 said			0
different brain structures : example midline sagittal and coronal colour fractional anisotropy ( @entity127 ) images for a control subject with a normal brain and a patient suffering from agenesis of the corpus callosum @entity133 of the corpus callosum can arise if individuals are born missing dna from chromosome 16 and often leads to autism			1
scientists have long puzzled over what the link is between this disorder and the autistic brain , especially since not all people with this malformation develop autism , said dr @entity147 , professor of neurology and genetics			1
doctors believe this is because the brain has a rich capacity for rewiring in alternative ways			0
pursuing this question , dr @entity90 and dr @entity155 turned to @entity157 and the mathematical technique of network analysis , which has previously been used by urban planners to optimise the timing of traffic lights to speed traffic			0
the researchers believe their study is the first to apply network analysis to brain mapping for a genetic cause of autism			2
network analysis : these structural connectome maps show the differences in brain wiring between three subjects with agenesis of the corpus callosum and three subjects with normal brains the brain offers a significantly complicated challenge for analysis because , unlike the streets of a given city , the brain has hundreds of billions of neurons			1
many of these make tens of thousands of connections to each other , making its level of connectivity highly complex			0
by comparing the seven rain man - like brains to those of 11 people without this malformation , the scientists determined how particular structures called the cingulate bundles were smaller and the neurons within these bundles were less connected to others in the brain			1
they also found that the network topology of the brain was more variable in people with agenesis of the corpus callosum than in people without the malformation			1
dr @entity90 and dr @entity155 are senior authors on the study , which is already available online .			0

researchers use brain scans and network analysis to map the brains of patients with agenesis of the corpus callosum
people with this condition , which *affected* real - life rain man @entity31 , are lacking the neurological structure which connects the left and right brains
scientists hope their findings will shed light on why some people with the condition develop autism and others do not
