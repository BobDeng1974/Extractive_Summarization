‘ a new shootout at @entity4 headquarters in @entity26 – a lone gunman and 7 corpses			0
nobody ’s even surprised anymore , ’ @entity11 tweeted two hours after shots first rang out			2

‘ with humility , but with resolve , let us never lose sight of that essential truth			0
’ @entity14 was urging @entity18 to support a strike on @entity17 as a means of halting its human rights violations			1
but the @entity7 politician used the words to mock @entity18			2
twisting words : last week , @entity14 called @entity18 's willingness to end human rights violations in @entity17 using military intervention ' what makes us exceptional ' ‘ the @entity18 should part with the notion of @entity18 exceptionalism , ’ @entity11 tweeted about an hour later			1
‘ it contradicts the principles of equal rights and smells of political racism			0
’ this is not @entity11 ’s first swipe at @entity18 , nor is it his first foray onto the international stage , though his timing and methods leave him more wide open for criticism than ever before			0
@entity11 , who is seen as especially close with the @entity70 , was among the most vocal in @entity7 during @entity73 leaker @entity72 ’s prolonged stay at a @entity75 airport			1
@entity72 was eventually granted asylum in @entity7 , but not before @entity11 got in his jabs — at @entity72 and @entity18			1
bad timing : @entity80 's comments came as the death toll was still rising from the @entity4 shooting he mocked			0

at another point in the saga , reports mistakenly suggested @entity72 has left @entity7 and the @entity18 demanded to know his whereabouts			1
' why should the @entity18 expect restraint and understanding from @entity7 , ’ @entity11 mocked at the time			2
on monday , @entity11 again showed no restraint when he used the occasion of a deadly shooting to make a political point			0

as of monday afternoon , the death count was 12 .			0
