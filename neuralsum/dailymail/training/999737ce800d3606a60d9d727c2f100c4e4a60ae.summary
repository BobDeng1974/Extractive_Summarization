chef @entity16 with @entity3 , his 10 - layer sweet and savoury pancake containing 2,500 calories diners will have to finish the £ 15 @entity25 - style pancake dish if they want to get it for free mr @entity16 , 27 , said : ' i think it 's pretty calorific			1
a stack of four @entity25 pancakes with just maple syrup is about 600 calories			1
' i think it has got to be possible to finish it			2
we did a trial a while back with a just a stack of 10 plain pancakes and two out of four people succeeded , although one did n't do it in the time			2
' obviously this is a lot more , and there are many different flavours to contest with but i reckon someone out there will take it on and do it ! ' i am not sure how all these different flavours like @entity11 with spinach , or chicken with chocolate or even mayonnaise with toffee sauce are going to work out			1
that 's why it 's a challenge			2
' the layers are made up of @entity25 - style pancakes topped with @entity71 tomato sauce and cheese , followed by a layer of @entity75 chicken and bbq sauce , and a layer of marinated chicken mayo and black pepper			1
the pancake tower also includes layers of spinach , tomato and cheese and also a pancake topped with salami			2
four sweet layers of strawberry and @entity11 , peanut butter and sliced banana , hazelnut , slice banana and toffee sauce and a mix of milk and white chocolate buttons complete the dish			1
on top of the pancake tower is a fried egg smothered in maple syrup			1
the tower costs £ 15 and must be finished in just 10 minutes with winners getting the dish for free			2
in order to make the tower , which takes 15 minutes , @entity16 and his team follow a strict plan of assembling the tower with the savoury pancakes at the bottom because they take the longest to cook			1
the tower takes 15 minutes to make and is assembled with savoury pancakes at the bottom mr @entity16 added : ' we wanted to do something different this @entity19			1
' we have a lot of these ingredients on the menu and we thought , how weird would it be to put them all together			0
you see these really delicious looking pancake towers with strawberries and cream only			0
' we thought what if we just did everything you could have on a pancake and made it into a tower			0
it is kind of like having five layer as of main course followed by a five layers of dessert			0
it is definitely something no one else will have thought about			0
' @entity139 tries - and fails - to demolish the calorific pancake tower , which is on sale in @entity28 challenger @entity139 , 24 , from @entity143 , a council worker , said : ' i could n't eat it , not a chance and i 'm a big eater ! when i first saw it i thought ' that looks easy ! ' i watch @entity151 and it looked nothing like that			1
i thought " i can do this "			0
' then i got stuck in and there was not a chance i was finishing it			0
it was much more difficult than i thought			0
all the fillings are really hard to get through			0
i was there for about 40 minutes and by that point i had only eaten a quarter			0
' this is definitely a challenge to do and with all those different fillings and textures and flavours it became really hard to get through			2
i would have a go at it again			0
it is deceptively hard ! '			0
