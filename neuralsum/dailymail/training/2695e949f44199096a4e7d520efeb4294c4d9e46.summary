scientists claim there is no evidence to support taking vitamin d supplements to stave off chronic disease and early death scientists claim there is no evidence to support taking vitamin d supplements to stave off chronic disease and early death - and results of several multi-million dollar trials currently under way are unlikely to alter this view			1
a new review examines existing evidence from 40 randomised controlled trials - the gold standard for proving cause and effect - and concludes that vitamin d supplementation does not prevent heart attacks , strokes , cancer , or bone fractures in the general population by more than 15 per cent			1
in fact , vitamin d supplements probably provide little , if any , health benefit , according to the study published in @entity29 journal			2
in @entity31 , the supplements market is worth £ 700 million a year - a growth of 16 per cent in five years - and the most popular pills are multi-vitamins and fish oils , which contain vitamin @entity37 some scientists assumed vitamin d , which is produced naturally by exposure to sunlight , could protect against disease because patients with cancer , heart disease or @entity47 ’s , or who died prematurely , often had very low levels of the nutrient			1
however , evidence from some trials suggests that rather than vitamin d deficiency leading to disease , these illnesses stop the body from producing vitamin d - so sufferers have lower levels			0
last month , a review of 462 studies involving more than a million adults said a lack of vitamin d was not a trigger for many common illnesses			0
in the latest study , dr @entity67 of the @entity68 , @entity69 , and colleagues used several types of review of existing studies , including a ‘ futility analysis ’ , to predict whether future research results might sway existing evidence			2
some scientists assumed vitamin d , which is produced naturally by exposure to sunlight , could protect against disease because patients with cancer , heart disease or @entity47 's the results of their study suggest the effect of vitamin d , taken with or without calcium , on heart attacks , strokes , cancer , and total fracture lies below a ‘ futility threshold ’			1
this means there would be no point in taking supplements as it would have little effect on health outcomes			2
for hip fractures , the results of some trials even suggested an increased risk with vitamin d supplementation			2
pregnant women and those who are breastfeeding are advised to take one vitamin d tablet a day - which they can get on prescription - to ensure their baby 's bones are healthy the authors ’ analysis of whether vitamin d supplementation can reduce death rates by five per cent or more was inconclusive			0
professor @entity112 , of @entity113 in @entity114 , writing in a @entity116 commentary , said : ‘ without stringent indications - i.e. supplementing those without true vitamin d insufficiency - there is a legitimate fear that vitamin d supplementation might actually cause net harm			0
’ two months ago the chief medical officer , dame @entity124 , called for free vitamins to be given to children after it emerged that a quarter of youngsters are short of vitamin @entity37 presently it is only available on prescription to under fives from low income families			0
in addition , pregnant women and those who are breastfeeding are advised to take one vitamin d tablet a day - which they can get on prescription - to ensure their baby ’s bones are healthy			0
dr @entity139 from the @entity140 , said three quarters of @entity31 have vitamin d intakes which are below the recommended level , with children and older people are at particular risk			0
’ she said : ‘ @entity149 , once thought to have largely disappeared in the @entity31 , has returned , in particular among children of @entity152 and @entity153 descent who have darker skins , but the disease is also seen in @entity157 children usually in areas of urban deprivation			0
she said the new review did not look at vitamin d ’s role in bone health , instead focusing on chronic conditions such as cancer			1
she added : ‘ @entity37 supplements are not intended for treating any disease conditions , and it is disappointing this review did not address the essential role of vitamin d in bone and musculoskeletal health			1
‘ in the light of the findings that 75 per cent of the @entity31 population have below recommended intakes of vitamin d and that vitamin d is essential for bone health as well as a number of other physiological functions , consideration should be given to everyone taking a vitamin d supplement all year round .			1
