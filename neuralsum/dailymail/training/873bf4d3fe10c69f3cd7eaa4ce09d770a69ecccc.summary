by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 16:58 est , 23 september 2012 updated : 04:37 est , 24 september 2012 millions of middle - class @entity3 must get ready to pay higher taxes , @entity2 has declared			1
with the nation facing its longest period of belt - tightening since the war , the deputy prime minister said the ‘ top 10 per cent ’ – around 3million earning more than £ 50,500 – should brace themselves for new levies			1
options include an end to tax relief on pension contributions for higher - rate taxpayers , an ‘ accessions tax ’ to replace inheritance tax , and further increases in capital gains tax			1
scroll down to watch unlikely class warrior : deputy prime minister @entity2 unveiled plans to hit millions of high - earning @entity3 with new taxes at the first full day of the @entity26 conference yesterday at the @entity26 conference in @entity28 , mr @entity2 today insisted mr @entity2 that the majority of people thought that a £ 60,000 salary was ' a considerable amount of money '			1
he told the @entity35 4 today programme : ' the vast majority of people - 90 per cent of the people in the country - would think a salary of £ 60,000 , £ 70,000 , £ 80,000 is a considerable amount of money			1
@entity2 today said he had developed a ‘ thicker skin ’ after two years in government – and he thinks he now know what he wants to do with power			1
in a surprising admission , the @entity26 leader appeared to suggest that when the coalition was formed in 2010 he did not know what he hoped to achieve , or how to concentrate on what was important			2
‘ strangely enough – i know this is contrary to the characterisation that people want to impose on me – i am much clearer in my own mind now two and a half years into it what want to do for the second half of the parliament , ’ he told @entity52 ’s today programme			2
‘ of course i have learned things			0
my skin has got thicker			0
‘ i have had to apologise for mistakes i have made , but i have learned i think more than i had at the beginning how to really distinguish the stuff that ’s important - whether it is business banks , fairer taxes , more apprenticeships , that will stand the test of time - and the day to day stuff that can dominate daily politics			2
’ ' people - decent , fair - minded folk who are earning far , far more than the national average - understand that they do need to make a fair contribution			0
' mr @entity2 has said he is confident that the @entity77 would sign up to new taxes on the top 10 per cent			1
in return , he suggested he was open to @entity82 moves to cut more from the vast benefits bill			2
mr @entity2 said the highest earners were already paying more overall , thanks to @entity87 decisions taken by the @entity88			1
he added : ‘ as fiscal restraint has to carry on for longer than we thought , you have to ask people at the top to make a [ further ] contribution			2
’ on the first full day of the conference : it is the deputy prime minister ’s stance on tax , designed in part to appease his party ’s restive left - wing grassroots , that will most alarm @entity82 mps			1
new taxes on those earning over £ 50,500 would hit middle - class families in @entity109 heartlands in @entity110 and the @entity111			0
among the jobs paying such a salary are primary school deputy head , police inspector , fire brigade watch manager and senior nurse consultant			0
the @entity26 have long campaigned for a ‘ mansion tax ’ – an annual levy on high - value properties – but are devising alternative proposals having failed to persuade mr @entity122 to go ahead			1
in a policy consultation document , the party said the most significant levy on wealth was inheritance tax , paid on a person ’s estate over the value of £ 325,000			0
it is avoided by many using trusts , gifts or various reliefs , for example on agricultural land and property			0
the document suggested an ‘ accessions tax ’ , where the liability would fall on the person receiving the legacy rather than the estate of the deceased			2
this would make the tax impossible to avoid			0
fighting for his political life : mr @entity2 and his wife , @entity148 , share drinks whilst meeting candidates from the party 's candidate diversity programme during the conference yesterday he 's got her vote : ms @entity155 applauds her husband as he takes a question and answer session the @entity26 also want to target tax breaks offered to high earners on their pension contributions			1
currently , annual retirement contributions of up to £ 50,000 are exempt from tax			0
the chancellor cut that threshold from £ 255,000 in his first emergency budget , but the @entity26 want to go further			2
mr @entity2 told @entity169 ’s @entity168 programme : ‘ we now know that the country is going to have to go through a period of belt - tightening for longer than we ’d hoped , and whoever is going to be in government in the next parliament – @entity176 , @entity109 , @entity26 or a combination of all three – will have to introduce further savings			1
‘ when i hear people from the @entity181 say all the money should come from poor people			0
who have lost their work and need some support before they find new work , that all the money should be taken away from them – i ’m saying no , hang on a minute , let ’s make sure that we do this as fairly as possible			0
’ in the limelight : mr @entity2 told @entity35 political journalist @entity168 that he believed that the brunt of the government 's austerity programme should n't be borne by the poor mr @entity2 said there was a ‘ very considerable chance ’ of the @entity82 agreeing new wealth taxes , pointing out that the @entity88 has already increased capital gains tax and stamp duty , while clamping down on tax avoidance			1
‘ i think many people who are of considerable wealth in this country want to play their part , ’ he said			0
‘ i do n’t think you can ask people on middle and low incomes who , after all , are the vast majority of the @entity3 population , to bear the brunt of this adjustment			0
’ the @entity26 , who are flatlining in the polls , are desperate to use the conference to demonstrate areas where they differ from their conservative coalition partners			1
as well as on the economy , they are highlighting arguments over the environment and civil liberties .			0
