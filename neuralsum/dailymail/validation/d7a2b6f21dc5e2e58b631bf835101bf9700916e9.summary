emails have become the norm within the workplace but they are now being banned at some @entity4 companies as it is seen to be the cause of stress and misunderstandings among staff			1

one director also says his team has been advised against sending emails to each other during out of office hours , including weekends			2
some @entity4 companies are banning emails as directors believe internal emails cause stress and misunderstandings among staff @entity30 , the director of facilities management service provider @entity32 , says he implemented this new rule six months ago and has already seen a positive difference in the workplace			1
the policy was introduced to his 30 staff members in @entity38 after particular instances which caused unnecessary pressure , conflict and disagreements			0
' we had a few cases where staff were feeling compelled to respond to emails that were sent on weekends or public holidays , ' mr @entity30 told @entity49			2
' @entity50 were feeling like their personal time was being stolen from them			0
' i also found that it is hard to imply the correct tone in an email so there were often instances where staff were offended by emails sent by other colleagues or felt like they were being unfairly treated			2
' it was enough to cause angst among employees which further became a distraction in the workplace			0
' face - to - face interaction or instant messaging has become the preferred means of communication among these employees in order to de-clutter their inbox and create better working relationships for the ceo of website optimisation company @entity79 , he 's introduced instant messaging among staff and has left email correspondence for clients only			1
' it 's about finding the right way to communicate in a simple manner within the workplace , ' @entity84 told @entity49			0
' i 'm not anti-email			0
i believe clients love emails but they have to be relevant			0
' however emailing often is n't suitable for internal communication and these kind of emails can clutter our inbox			1
' i found that instant messaging was much suitable for the business and also a very casual form of communication			1
' mr @entity84 also introduced this new strategy about eight months ago to his five @entity103 staff and 15 others who are based overseas			0
' the problem with email is that it is an e-version of a letter so it 's unnecessary for internal communication , ' he said			2

' mr @entity84 says emails or even phone calls can be intrusive to staff who are not in the office at the time			2
' with instant messaging , people can respond when it 's suitable for them when they 're back in the office , ' he said			1
' there 's a misconception and expectation that your response to instant messages has to be immediate but that 's not how we see it			0
for us , it 's an organising method that works for our great team and working culture			0
' one company director said he banned internal emails as his staff were increasingly feeling pressued to respond to them , particulary during their time off work so far , mr @entity30 says the new policy has been successful and is hoping to continue enforcing it at his company			1
and if an urgent matter arises after office hours , @entity32 staff are encouraged to phone colleagues ' out of respect for each other '			2
' i believe that work should n't interfere with your personal time and that way staff will come back to work much happier the next day , ' mr @entity30 said			0
' we 've also empowered employees to be self - governing when they receive internal emails , so they can choose to have a quiet word amongst themselves or not respond at all or respond when they 're back in the office			1
