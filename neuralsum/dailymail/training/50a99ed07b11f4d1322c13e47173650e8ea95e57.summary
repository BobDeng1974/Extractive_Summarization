by @entity0 @entity1 has been handed a key role at @entity3 to stop any further ' brain - drain ' of the club ’s best young players			1
@entity3 ’s pride in developing great young players for their first - team has been dented in recent years by the departure for different reasons of @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 , who have all gone on to enjoy great success elsewhere			1
@entity16 also left the club to join @entity18 in 2012			0
he will be expected to recommend to the @entity32 which players are ready to step up to train with the senior squad and who has the potential to play alongside the likes of @entity39 and @entity40 in competitive games			0
the first beneficiary could be young midfielder @entity43 who is currently out in @entity44 with the @entity46 under - 20 team			0
he has just a year left on his contract at @entity48 and the club do n’t want him to feel unwanted in a possible repeat of the @entity14 situation that saw the @entity52 leave for @entity53			2
having graduated through @entity3 ’s ranks himself , @entity1 has always maintained a healthy interest in the next generation of players at the club and gave teenagers @entity60 and @entity62 their debuts against @entity64 at the end of last season when he was in interim charge			1
told : new boss @entity28 has issued the important role to @entity1 for next season at @entity48 new : @entity1 was the one to give @entity60 ( left ) and @entity62 ( right ) their chance at @entity3 @entity1 was believed to have been unhappy with the direction the club were taking under @entity74 last season but accepted the post of being @entity28 ’s @entity76			1
the @entity32 has a track record of giving young players a chance and has helped @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 become world stars in the past			0
@entity3 will try to sign up to three new first - team players in this window but are willing to wait until after the @entity87 if necessary			2
@entity89 left - back @entity88 and @entity91 international defender @entity90 are widely - reported targets and @entity82 is interesting in linking up again with his former manager from @entity94			0
targets : @entity88 ( left ) and @entity90 ( right ) remain on the wishlist of @entity3			2
