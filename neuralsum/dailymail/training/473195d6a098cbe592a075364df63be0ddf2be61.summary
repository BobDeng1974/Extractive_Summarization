by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 the date is october 10 , 2013 , the place is @entity4 , @entity6 ’s plush pre-game haven			2
@entity7 is hatching a plan for a must - win clash with @entity10 and a flying young winger is central to his plans			2
@entity14 ’s @entity13 is about to be thrust into the big time			0
on the same night in @entity17 , the capital of @entity18 , @entity16 is playing for @entity6 ’s @entity19 in a @entity21 qualifier			1
he toils during a routine 4 - 0 win , exchanges words with team - mate @entity24 over who should take a penalty and is eventually substituted after 65 minutes			2
what a difference six months makes : @entity16 argues with @entity24 in an under 21 match against @entity18 meanwhile : @entity13 makes a name for himself in the senior match against @entity10 at @entity31 job done : @entity7 was delighted with his new star winger @entity34 man : but on saturday night , @entity16 lit up the @entity35 with a fine match against @entity37 when @entity16 returns to @entity6 , he receives a call from @entity7 to join the senior squad for the final @entity41 fixture with @entity42 but it is purely for educational purposes			1
@entity13 sparkled against @entity10 , kept his place in the starting line - up and looked certain to go to @entity47			2
not even @entity16 ’s biggest fan would have suggested back then that their respective roles would be reversed			2
the then 18 - year - old was not playing for @entity52 , not thriving for the @entity19 and had been told by his club manager @entity53 to ‘ stabilise his life ’			1
given @entity16 , who grew up in the shadows of @entity58 , had faced two separate court appearances in may and august last year ( he was never prosecuted ) , his talent would go unfulfilled if he continued down a path littered with distractions			2
@entity52 had held @entity16 in the highest esteem for an age			1
they paid an initial £ 600,000 to sign him from @entity64 in february 2010 when he was just 15 but as the nation started thinking about a trip to @entity47 , all was not how it should have been			0
between october 19 and december 1 , @entity16 played just seven minutes for @entity52 in the @entity69			1
the only trip he looked like making at that juncture was on loan somewhere , as thoughts of the @entity35 seemed fanciful			0
youngster : @entity16 impressed at @entity52 after making the big switch from @entity64 as a teenager meant to be ? @entity16 went to @entity77 , @entity31 , within touching distance of the stadium confidence : @entity37 could n't deal with the young star in the @entity83 game in @entity84 now look at him			1
his performance against @entity37 in @entity84 on saturday evening was the latest , compelling proof that @entity16 ’s talent is burgeoning and he could become a mainstay of this @entity6 team for the next three , maybe even four , @entity35 campaigns			1
blessed with scintillating pace , a sure touch and outstanding technique , his body strength should not be underestimated			0
his team - mates at @entity52 often talk of how robust he is in training and @entity37 midfielder @entity99 certainly received a jolt when they collided in @entity84			1
‘ he ’s the toughest in our squad , ’ says @entity52 and @entity6 captain @entity101			1
‘ i do n’t go near him in training because if i do , there is only one winner			0
he just needs to keep learning			0
’ that quality , more than any other , has been critical to his development these last seven months			0
@entity16 , who has moved out of @entity52 city centre to a more conservative , tranquil area , has been pulled aside by his colleagues and told what he can achieve with concentration and dedication			1
it should also not be forgotten the role @entity53 has played in his development			0
@entity52 ’s manager has been tough with him — one particular dressing down was broadcast in the tv documentary being : @entity52 in 2012 — but he has also filled him with confidence and given @entity16 a platform to thrive			1
quality : @entity16 has fought through the tough times at @entity52 to become a key performer ‘ i thought when @entity16 ( first ) started he was outstanding , ’ said @entity53			1
‘ then he had a real dip in his performances for a number of reasons			0
but i am always fair with players			0
i always try to act in the best interests of them , if they are performing in training and showing a real focus			0
’ that focus was evident in the sweltering atmosphere of the @entity140 on saturday night			0
he served notice of what was in store with a thumping third - minute shot into the side - netting and played a key role in the move that led to @entity149 ’s equaliser			0
and that performance brings this tale full circle			0
another must - win @entity35 game looms for @entity7 and the plan he will be hatching for @entity155 at the plush @entity157 hotel in @entity158 will again revolve around a flying young winger			1
@entity13 ’s time was in october but the present is about @entity16 and there is little doubt he has the talent , tenacity and temperament to cope with whatever @entity155 throw at him and help maintain @entity6 ’s interest in this tournament .			2

six months *ago* @entity16 was substituted in @entity19 game against @entity18
meanwhile , @entity172 was *shining* for @entity6 against @entity10
some turnaround for @entity16 , who found form with @entity52
played *superbly* for @entity6 against @entity37 in 2 - 1 @entity83 loss
*tipped* to shine for the remainder of the @entity35
