it is a common problem for airlines , ferries and cruise ships - how do you make passengers pay attention to the safety briefing ? @entity8 believes it has found the solution , producing a video complete with a rapping captain and dancing staff that certainly attracts attention			1
doing away with the monotone yet informative messages usually portrayed in safety briefings , the @entity16 - based company said it wanted to inject some ' fun ' into this year 's offering			1
but not everybody is a fan , with some commentators saying they would prefer to jump overboard than listen to the song			2
the captain introduces the rap for a very different safety demonstration condor ferries have produced the safety rap as part of their ' @entity32 ' branding slightly out of sync and with some incredibly cringeworthy dance moves , the video seems to have done the trick and has already been viewed nearly 20,000 times since it was posted on @entity38 several days ago			1
the video begins with a captain sporting blue sunglasses and some questionable moves as he announces : ' to ensure you have good times on board , please listen up to the following safety message from @entity8			1
' it 's soon time for the crew to get involved as they raise their hands in the air singing , ' life jackets , life jackets , they 're right beneath your seat			0
' the pair then instruct those watching how to operate the life jacket			0
' it clips together so easily just listen for the click , ' sings the female			0
' that means you 've done it properly and you look so very hip			0
' that may be a matter of opinion			0
the steward raps how to fix the life jacket on and blow the whistle , all out of sync all you have to do is just ' listen for the click ' says the stewardess , and that means you 've done it right the male then takes the lead when notifying of where the emergency exits are , complete with some cringeworthy dance moves that involve bouncing on the spot and hilarious hand signals			2
but it only gets worse			0
it 's back to the captain , as he comes into shot singing ' now ladies , hey ladies , ' while making what can only be described as an ' uncomfortable ' facial expression			2
however , rather than flirting , he is simply advising that ' sharp objects ca n't go on our slides , so leave those heels behind			0
' the steward then bounces on the spot and uses amusing hand gestures to warn of the emergency exits the emergency slide is then shown , at least in graphic form , as the stewardess demonstrates how , well , to slide down it			0
the video then uses graphics to show how the staff can help passengers from wheeling their luggage , to using a resuscitator and defibrillator , as ' you name it , we have it			2
' the star of the show then comes back , the captain , as he sings : ' so who would have thought that the @entity8 could bust out such good rhymes ? ' the video is being broadcast on all sailings between @entity124 and the @entity125			1
he 's back ! the captain then makes a somewhat unnerving re-appearance as he warns ladies not use heels down the emergency slides the idea was conceived and produced by @entity134 - based @entity133 , working closely with the @entity8 safety , marine operations and marketing teams			1
@entity139 , executive director – commercial at @entity8 , said : ' we 're really proud of the new safety video , it 's been a very fun project to work on , and we 're delighted with the results			1
' our brief was simple , we wanted something a little bit different , something that our passengers would sit up and take notice of , and which would appeal to all members of the family			0
we think that the rap , with the @entity32 messaging does just that			0
the stewardess demonstrates how passengers would use the emergency slide ... not too difficult ' ferry travel is very family - friendly , there are no restrictions on the amount of luggage you can bring – you can pack everything in to your car , and off you go			1
' we hope that our passengers , whether they are frequent travellers or joining us for the first time this summer will enjoy the video and their @entity32 experience onboard @entity169 as we set sail to @entity171 and @entity172			0
' however the video has been met with less - than positive comments by users on @entity38 , where it has been hosted			2
the staff are there to help with passengers ' every need , according to the safety video @entity182 wrote : ' i want to pour lava into my ears , ' while @entity186 added : ' i 'd want to jump into the harbour if this is for real			1
' @entity189 is somewhat dubious as to the authenticity of the captain writing : ' i hope they keep a look out for fishing boats better - now they seem to have employed a stripper as a captain			2
' condor are believed to be the first ferry operator to produce an onboard safety video to feature a rap			1
the release has coincided with the launch of its brand new state - of - the - art @entity169 with a new mission statement of ' @entity32			0
' the video has been met with pleasure by senior executives at @entity8			1

hilarious and out - of - sync video shows a captain and two members of staff
trio run through the safety aspects of ferry travel with a ' rap '
video has been ridiculed by viewers online , with one saying they would ' jump in the harbour if this is for real '
is part of @entity8 's new *#* @entity227 campaign and branding exercise
