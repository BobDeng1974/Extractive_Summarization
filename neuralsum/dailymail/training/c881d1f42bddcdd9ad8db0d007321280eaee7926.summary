by @entity0 @entity1 , who lost both his legs in @entity3 , walks with the revolutionary @entity5 knee - which is controlled by @entity6 and uses @entity8 technology a former soldier who lost both legs in @entity3 has told how being fitted with the world ’s most advanced bionic knee has transformed his life			1
@entity1 , 29 , is the first wounded serviceman to wear a ground - breaking prosthetic limb which has a @entity6 remote control to switch from walking , jogging , cycling and even golfing modes			1
it can also automatically sense and react to his movements , enabling it to adapt seamlessly when he breaks out into a run or tackles a flight of stairs			0
the device is also waterproof , meaning he can keep it on in the shower or at the @entity28 mr @entity1 , who lives with wife @entity29 and two - year - old son @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity32 , said the new limb would give him ‘ almost complete freedom ’			1
‘ before , i had to switch between different knees for different activities – this is much , much easier , ’ he said			0
‘ i feel blessed that i ’ve regained this much mobility			0
’ mr @entity1 was just a fortnight from the end of his first tour of duty with the elite 24 @entity43 supporting the @entity44 in @entity45 in 2009 when a @entity46 exploded			1
he lost his left leg above the knee and his right leg just below it			2
last month he was given the new @entity51 model of knee , funded by the @entity53			0
the £ 70,000 limb , the first to be fitted in the @entity55 , is programmed from a laptop and can be switched manually between different @entity60 what makes it particularly ground - breaking is it also uses @entity8 - style sensors to anticipate when the wearer is breaking into a run – to catch a bus , for example – and adapts accordingly , just like a human leg			1
it was designed with the @entity70 military and was attached at @entity72 ’s @entity71 in @entity73			0
yesterday , mr @entity1 said : ‘ i ’ve just started kicking a football with my son			2
he will have to keep up with me now			0
’ he added : ‘ since i was injured , i have n’t been able to go back to work as an engineer because the prosthetic legs that i was using before really limited my movement , but now i ’m hoping to get back to work			2
’ the limb , developed in part with the @entity53 , can switch between modes to allow the user to perform several different everyday actions the knee ( pictured left on the nearest leg and right being adjusted ) can change between modes - such as swimming , running , driving and biking , using a @entity6 remote			1
previously mr @entity1 would have to change prosthetic in order to do different activities a diagram showing the natural walking gait - or pattern - the wearer of the prosthetic will achieve			1
it is very similar to the gait of someone without a bionic limb the full @entity5 knee			1
mr @entity1 is the first @entity55 veteran to be fitted with the technology the prosthetic was funded by the @entity53			1
the prosthetic is made from aluminium , steel and carbon fibre and costs £ 70,000			1
it gives the wearer the most anatomically correct walking posture and provides a similar gait - or walking pattern - to a human leg			2
the knee operation automatically bends when the user picks their foot off the ground - and so simulates natural walking style			1
it has a battery life of five days - much longer than any other previous models and is the first to be completely waterproof			0
it is the first prosthetic that allows the wearer to walk backwards and up stairs and over obstacles			0
it is capable of doing several modes - including biking , golfing , driving , walking and running - all of which are programmed in to the prosthetic by a computer before fitting			1
the user can switch between modes using a @entity6 remote			1
the knee also uses similar technology used in @entity8 gaming consoles and smartphones to sense when the user is about to go change activity - and so can automatically switch between walking and running modes			1
there is also a mute button so that it can be silenced for things like meetings or trips to the cinema			0
the war veteran said today the ' fantastic ' prosthetic will give him ' almost complete freedom ' to play with his young son @entity30 , 2			1
he also hopes it will mean he can return to work as an engineer			0
he said : ' it feels fantastic , we ’ll balanced and comfortable			0
i can now walk up and down stairs , backwards and it ’s waterproof which is really important			0
' it sounds like a small thing but i will be able to take @entity30 for swimming lessons and go to the beach			0
mr @entity1 's new leg is programmed by a computer to execute a variety of settings			2
the father says he will have far more freedom to play with his child now he has the prosthetic ' before i had to switch between different knees for different activities , this is much , much easier			1
' i ’ve just started kicking a football with him and got him some mini golf clubs			0
@entity30 will have to keep up with me now			0
' @entity72 ’s @entity71 ( @entity188 ) in @entity73 also became the first in the @entity55 to fit the world ’s most advanced prosthetic knee			2
mr @entity1 said : ' i am so pleased to be the first person to use this new leg and i am so grateful to the staff at the @entity71			2
' since i was injured i have n’t been able to go back to work as an engineer because the prosthetic legs that i was using before really limited my movement , but now i ’m hoping to get back to work			2
the encouragement of my friends , family and the soldiers from the regiment has been immense			0
i feel blessed that i ’ve regained this much mobility ' dr @entity207 , consultant at the @entity71 said : ' it ’s so pleasing to see a young man who is a double amputee , as a result of fighting for his country , being given a new lease of life thanks to this amazing new technology			2
we know how much this will enhance @entity1 ’s life and give him new opportunities and we are so proud to be the first centre in the @entity55 to provide this piece of kit for one of our patients			2
' in 2010 the government announced plans to invest £ 15 million to support and improve prosthetic services for military veterans			2
following this , staff at the @entity71 have been working in partnership with the veteran ’s @entity232 and @entity234 , who have designed the new @entity5 knee , to develop new prosthetic technology			1
the leg has previously only been used by a handful of veterans with similar disabilities in the @entity70			0
materials : uses corrosion resistant materials such as titanium , hard anodised aluminum , stainless steel , and @entity248 : the prosthetic has undergone stringent waterproof testing and is completely @entity252 life : 5 days			0
charging point is at the back of the knee and can even be charged through clothing			0
sensors : the @entity5 has additional sensors			0
from the moment the heel strikes the ground until the toe lifts off , the sensors tell the microprocessor exactly where the wearer is in the walking cycle , as well as measuring the amount of force acting on the knee - helping give the user the most natural movement possible			1
new technologies : an accelerometer and a gyroscope intuitively know where the leg is in space , using the same technologies from @entity8 gaming systems and smartphones , for a virtually natural gait			1
activity modes : offers five activity modes including – biking , golfing , and more – activated using a key fob - sized remote			1
run : innovative @entity288 mode detects start - and - stop running - such as crossing a street or trying to catch a bus .			0

@entity1 , 29 , lost both legs in @entity293 , @entity45 , in 2009
is the first person in the country to be fitted with high - tech @entity5 knee
previously had to change his prosthetic when doing different activities
new knee changes from walking to running modes automatically by technology found in @entity8 gaming consoles and smartphones
other modes such as biking and driving selected via @entity6 remote
is made of carbon fibre , steel and aluminium and costs £ 70,000
