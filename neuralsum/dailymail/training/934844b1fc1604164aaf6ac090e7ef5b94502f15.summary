by @entity1 reporter published : 19:36 est , 8 september 2013 updated : 19:44 est , 8 september 2013 red - coloured sprouts are also being trialled at the company 's site in @entity5 the vegetable that most sharply divides opinion around the family dinner table is to get a flavour makeover in an ambitious bid to boost its popularity , according to a new report yesterday			1
generations of children have groaned at the appearance of @entity17 sprouts on their plate at mealtimes and determinedly pushed the leafy green vegetable to one side			1
but now a major new campaign is being launched to shake up the healthy sprout market and introduce a variety of different tastes to the leafy green vegetables			1
trade magazine @entity27 said yesterday : ' the humble sprout is being given a makeover with new flavour strengths , and even colours , in a bid to encourage more brits to eat the much maligned vegetable			2
' da it reports that @entity37 , a major supplier of brassicas and other vegetables to leading high street supermarket chains , is running field trials of mild - tasting and strong - tasting sprouts at its site in @entity44 , @entity5			1
the new sprouts would be harvested later this year and if they performed well in taste tests , were likely to be grown commercially next year and could be on store shelves by @entity48			0
@entity49 , new product development manager at @entity37 told the magazine : ' we are just trying to make people aware and increase the marketing around sprouts and increase the fixture in store			0
' she said that strong - tasting sprouts would appeal to the ' sprout traditionalists			2
' red - coloured sprouts are also being trialled and the firm already commercially grows the @entity62 - a cross between the @entity17 sprout and kale , for a major retailer			1
generations of children have groaned at the appearance of @entity17 sprouts on their plate at mealtimes and determinedly pushed the leafy green vegetable to one side the company is also trialling a new type of brassica that can be used both as a lettuce and as a cabbage			1
it is milder in flavour than cabbage but stronger than a lettuce , as well as red - veined cavolo nero and coloured kales			2
sprouts became part of our staple ' meat and two veg ' diet during and after the @entity92 mainly due to rationing , but in the 80s and 90s their popularity was affected by changes in our eating habits and increasingly exotic diets			0
they also bore the brunt of schoolboy jokes which helped dampen the enthusiasm of an entire generation that led to general sales , outside of the @entity48 market , falling into decline through the 90s			0
however , sprout popularity rose again during the noughties as a result of them often being used in recipes and tv cookery programmes by celebrity chefs			0
it is estimated that as much as 80 per cent of total @entity116 sprout sales take place in the two week @entity48 and @entity119 period .			0
