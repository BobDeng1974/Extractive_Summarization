two men who led a drunk teenager from a nightclub to an alleyway where they subjected her to a rape ' of the most squalid kind ' were today jailed for nine years each			1

appearing at @entity14 , the two 21 - year - olds were each convicted of one count of rape , while @entity7 was also found guilty of a further charge of sexual assault			1
both men will have to sign the sex offenders register for life			0
jailed : @entity7 , left , and @entity22 , right , both 21 , are beginning nine - year jail sentences for ' a rape of the most squalid kind ' after they attacked a woman they had just met on the dancefloor of a nightclub jailing the pair , mr @entity30 told them their victim was ' so drunk that she was vulnerable and defenceless to your exploitation			1
' but , he told them , ' there should be no doubt that what you did was still rape , and rape of the most squalid kind			2
' ' your victim was very unwise to allow herself to drink so much that she became so thoroughly inebriated , ' the judge said			2
' but it was you , and only you , who deliberately took advantage of her condition , to take her to a dark alley to see what fun you could have with her			0
' it 's just lasses attention - seeking ' : what @entity7 , pictured arriving at court for an earlier hearing , said of the victim after he was arrested by police ' it was you who decided to treat her body as a plaything on which to act out your sordid fantasies of having a threesome			1
' @entity8 , of @entity66 , @entity67 , and @entity68 , of @entity69 , near @entity66 , had denied the charges against them			0
they claimed their victim had instigated the sexual encounter and had consented throughout			2
but at the end of a nine - day trial a jury of ten men and two women rejected their accounts			2
in a victim impact statement , the traumatised victim - who had never before had a sexual experience - said she had worried for some months that she had contracted an std and also feared that she may have been pregnant			1
@entity7 and @entity8 had been drinking for most of the day before going to @entity83 , a popular dance venue in @entity85 , @entity67			1
they they met the 18 - year - old victim for the first time on the dance floor and shared a kiss			1
but within 11 minutes , they had steered her outside and down a nearby alleyway			1
prosecutor @entity93 told the court that the pair took advantage of the fact she was intoxicated			0
@entity99 showed her ' stumbling repeatedly and often ' as she was led out of the night club			2
what followed was a fifty minute ordeal which left @entity8 and @entity7 's victim looking as though she had been in a fight			1
when they had finished with her , @entity8 and @entity7 ignored their bleeding victim 's pleas for help finding her friends ; instead they left her in the dark alleyway and caught a a cab away from the scene			1
laughing and joking as they made their way home , they even boasted to the driver about what they had just done , police said			1
when @entity7 was arrested , he admitted having sex , but claimed it was consensual , and said : ' it 's just lasses attention - seeking			1
' inebriated : @entity7 and @entity8 had been drinking for most of the day before going to @entity83 , pictured , a popular dance venue in @entity85 , @entity67 , where they met their victim detective inspector @entity129 of @entity85 's @entity130 had helped to investigate the case			1
' i am delighted that justice has been delivered for the victim			2
she was subjected to a sustained attack by @entity8 and @entity7			1
they treated her like a piece of meat and left her bleeding and distressed , ' said @entity141			2
' they laughed and joked about it afterwards , even boasting to the taxi driver about what had just happened when they left the scene			2
' i ca n't imagine how any woman would feel after such an ordeal , but it is particularly distressing that it was the victim 's first sexual experience and she will have to live with that for the rest of her life			0
' the victim 's family thanked the police and their partner organisations for the support they had shown their daughter throughout her ordeal			0
' from the minute the police picked our daughter up she has been treated with the utmost respect and sympathy by everyone who has had contact with her , ' the family said in a statement			0
' this includes every police officer involved , the support services and the court officials			0
we would like to extend our thanks to all concerned			0
' everyone has acted with a high degree of professionalism , but at the same time have been very kind			0
' the number of recorded sexual offences is at a 10 - year high , official figures show			0
in the year to march 2014 there were a total of 64,205 sex crime incidents across @entity187 and @entity188 , an increase of a fifth on the previous year			0
within that , the number of rapes increased 26 per cent to 20,745 incidents , while the number of other sexual offences increased 17 per cent fo 43,460 incidents			0
the @entity196 said the increases may in part be because victims are more willing to come forward after the high - profile prosecutions of public figures such as @entity202 and @entity203			0
' while some of these increases will be a direct consequence of the historical crimes reported as part of @entity210 , there is evidence to suggest that there has been a wider " @entity214 effect " , ' the @entity196 said in a statement			0
' this refers to an increased willingness on the part of victims of sexual offences that are not directly connected to @entity220 to come forward to report both historical and recent sexual offences			0

@entity7 and @entity22 used their victim ' as a plaything '
they had led her outside to rape her just 11 minutes after meeting her
she was left bleeding in an alleyway and as they boasted to a cab driver
when @entity7 was arrested he accused victim of ' attention - seeking '
