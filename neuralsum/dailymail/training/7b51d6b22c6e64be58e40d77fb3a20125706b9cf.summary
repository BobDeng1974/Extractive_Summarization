things have gone off kilter since the 31 - year - old became just the second man in history to complete an @entity8 and world ' double - double ' in the distance events			0
@entity11 was disappointed by his display at the @entity14 and frustrated further when illness forced him to miss the @entity17 in @entity18			2
that illness gave him extra incentive to succeed in a competition which witnessed his long - distance breakthrough in 2010			0
then , in @entity50 , @entity11 achieved the first major double of his career and matched that feat with victory on the final day of the championships in @entity24			1
@entity57 1 ! @entity11 gave his competitors no chance with a show of dominance at the @entity2 follow the leader : @entity11 only relinquished the lead once as he brilliantly intimidated the chasing pack six weeks on from his health scare , @entity11 followed up wednesday 's 10,000 metres glory by winning gold in the 5,000m at the @entity72			2
while @entity74 of @entity75 kept with him when he kicked just after the bell , there was no catching the @entity77 as he crossed the line in 14 minutes 05.82 seconds			0
team - mate @entity79 followed @entity11 home and won bronze - success which took @entity83 's medal haul to 20 , breaking their previous @entity2 record of 19 set in @entity50 four years ago			1
