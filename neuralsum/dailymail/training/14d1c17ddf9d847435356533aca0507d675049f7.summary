@entity3 ( 3 - 5 - 2 ) @entity16 7 alert to tip wide @entity19 cross that would have flown into far corner and good save from @entity21 @entity22 7 another composed display from the 22 - year - old , who was asked to collect the ball from his goalkeeper to spark attacks @entity29 7 imperious at heart of @entity3 ’s defence for the most part , physically dominating his @entity35 colleague @entity21 @entity2 striker @entity0 equalised with a thumping header against @entity3 @entity38 7 growing in importance to this team each week , strong , sensible and calm @entity41 6 unbalanced by @entity19 ’s movement for @entity0 goal and unable to make amends to stop cross , but decent overall @entity47 6 deployed deeper than usual , in midfield , and added energy , particularly in the first half @entity51 6 effective at breaking up @entity2 ’s play and provided a steadying influence when @entity3 rocked slightly @entity54 started the game in defence but was moved back into midfield at half - time @entity59 7 crunching tackle on @entity21 to announce his intentions and was an effervescent presence @entity62 6 provided an outlet on the left but too often cut back rather than cross first time @entity9 7.5 took his goal superbly , with a shuffle to find space and clinical shot			1
almost got a second with a powerful header @entity72 6.5 gave @entity3 pace to trouble @entity2 before becoming victim of incredibly harsh red card for his strong tackle on @entity19 subs @entity78 ( for @entity47 80 ) 6 , @entity79 6 ( for @entity62 ) both contributed late on and @entity79 almost won it with stunning shot that whistled over			0
@entity2 showed theit attacking instincts by playing @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity0 @entity2 3 - 5 - 2 @entity87 7 no chance with @entity9 ’s goal and produced his customary excellent save from the @entity91 ’s second - half header @entity92 6.5 competed physically with @entity9 in the air but dallied on ball in second half to concede an opening @entity54 7 classy in central defence , moved to midfield at half - time to provide a platform for @entity2 attacks @entity3 striker @entity9 scored a wonderful goal and was a constant threat @entity104 6 allowed @entity9 too much room for his goal but recovered and marshaled defence from the central position in second half @entity110 6 willing as ever but unable to repeat his high tempo from the @entity114 game @entity115 5.5 one of his outings where it was difficult to see how he contributed , aside for a few shots from range @entity121 5 struggled to impose himself to any great degree and was understandably replaced at half - time @entity86 7 @entity2 ’s best player , pulling strings from midfield with floated passes to the wings and sharp balls into the strikers @entity72 was controversially sent off after a 50 - 50 challenge with @entity19 @entity19 6.5 villain - in - chief as far as @entity3 fans were concerned , staying down after @entity72 ’s tackle , but perfect cross for @entity0 goal @entity0 6.5 hardly touched the ball for long periods but provided a finishing touch with his forehead when required @entity21 6 a couple of efforts and adept link - up play but should have done better when fed by @entity86 inside the area @entity146 returned for @entity2 after missing three games because of a hamstring injury subs @entity150 6.5 ( for @entity121 46 ) , @entity151 6 ( for @entity21 62 ) , @entity152 5 ( for @entity110 74 ) @entity150 ’s arrival freed @entity2 in an attacking sense , @entity151 added a threat , @entity152 some legs att : 41,273			1
