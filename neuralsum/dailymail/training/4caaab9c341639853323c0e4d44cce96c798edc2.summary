by @entity0 published : 04:45 est , 28 july 2012 updated : 09:31 est , 28 july 2012 bookmakers have pledged to refund all bets placed on who would light the @entity5 cauldron after some of @entity8 's greatest olympians teamed up with young athletes for the honour			1
no one could have predicted the surprise move and the only fair solution was to refund more than £ 50,000 of bets placed over the last seven years , @entity11 said			1
other bookmakers , including @entity17 , also voided all bets , saying it was ' impossible to back the correct flame lighter '			2
surprise : in an unexpected move a group of seven young athletes lit the @entity24 during the @entity25 2012 @entity26 honour : the seven stars of the future were nominated to carry out the honour by a host of former @entity5 greats handover : sir @entity34 was given the honour of carrying the torch into the stadium where he then handed it over to the up and coming athletes the cauldron lighter had been a source of controversy in the lead up to last night 's opening ceremony with @entity5 legends sir @entity34 , @entity48 and @entity49 all hotly tipped to be given the honour			1
it even led to a war of words between former decathlete @entity48 and rower @entity34 as they seemingly went head to head to light the cauldron , as they both questioned the other 's credentials to be the one to light the fire to launch @entity25			1
@entity34 did run into the stadium holding the torch last night but he was greeted by seven young athletes , each nominated by himself and @entity67 @entity5 heroes @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , dame @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity48			1
it was the young athletes who each lit one of the copper petals which had been brought into the stadium with the teams and then rose to form the cauldron			2

' the teenagers , who have all shown promise in their disciplines , ran around the track together after being passed the flame			0
@entity112 , 17 , was nominated by gold medal - winning sailor @entity72			1

despite the surprise cauldron lighting sir @entity34 , said today that he was " very emotional " when he carried the @entity173 into the @entity87			1
the five - times @entity5 rowing champion told @entity175 : ' it was very special			1
i must admit i probably knew about 10 days before			0
i 'm looking forward now to not being asked questions such as ' are you lighting the torch , or the cauldron ? ' ' i suppose the questions now will be ' are you putting out the cauldron ? ' - i 've not had that phone call yet			0
' he said that when he entered the stadium there was an ' absolutely amazing atmosphere '			0
he added : ' there was a line - up of construction workers on the site , suited and booted , it was very emotional for them and for me			0
' sir @entity34 , who was at @entity195 today , where the rowing will take place , revealed that he saw very little of the opening ceremony			2
' i saw the first five minutes of the actual opening , then i was taken away for the filming , i got into my pyjama suit , i 've still got the shoes on now			0
speaking after the decision to refund all bets @entity205 , of @entity11 , said : ' what happened , no - one could have predicted			2
it was not put to us , nobody quoted it			0
