as one of the world ’s shortest football books it would be right up there with popular ground - sharing schemes and @entity8 ’s penalty shootout successes			0
no @entity10 manager has won the @entity11 ( @entity12 was the last to win the top flight in 1992 ) and none have won the @entity15 since @entity16 in 1984			1
in last year ’s @entity15 not a single @entity10 boss featured in the last 16 and this season will be no different			2
but there will be one 42 - year - old coach in the mix who hails from south - west @entity23			0
a man who finds himself no 2 at the no 1 club in world football at the moment ; although how long he stays as an assistant manager will depend on him			0
@entity29 ( left ) celebrates winning the @entity15 with @entity31 boss @entity30 assistant manager @entity29 chats with @entity31 star @entity32 ( left ) before a match @entity29 was a pe teacher in @entity34 in 2000 when he got the chance to coach part - time at @entity38 ’s youth academy			1
he took his @entity40 coaching badges while still working full time as a teacher and moving slowly up the pecking order at @entity43 , at @entity45 ’s academy , and then back at @entity38 again under @entity30 , winning the @entity11			1
the @entity47 coach who last may became only the second manager in history to win the @entity15 three times saw something in @entity29 , whose dad @entity52 played for @entity53 and @entity8 and brother @entity54 , that made sure he took him with him to @entity56 and then to @entity31 at the start of last season			1
@entity29 has no playing background but that never stopped @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 and maybe it ’s time @entity8 's search for great homegrown managers went beyond those who have played the game at a high level			2
although football fans below a certain age might struggle to believe it @entity8 has managed to produce decent international teams in the not too distant past with the so - called @entity75 of 2002 and two @entity77 - inspired sides in1990 and 1996 that both reached big semi-finals			0
@entity29 has previously worked for @entity30 at @entity38 and @entity56 ( above ) but from those three sides not a single top manager has emerged with @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 all at least having given it a go and verdicts still pending on the likes of @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91			1
@entity29 told @entity92 in an interview last year that as a player : ' it ’s only natural to think about yourself first and foremost but that when you are learning to be a coach you think about the bigger picture all the time '			2
he has had that bigger picture in mind for over a decade now and the rise from @entity38 ’s under - 16s coach to the man who found himself scribbling down the list of potential @entity31 penalty takers in last season ’s @entity15 final has been extraordinary			1
the way he has won the trust of @entity30 and the respect of some of the biggest names in the game , from @entity112 and @entity113 to @entity114 and @entity115 , has some of the @entity11 ’s biggest clubs monitoring his situation			2
the 42 - year - old listens in as @entity47 boss @entity30 gives instructions to former @entity121 winger @entity32 @entity29 , alongside @entity122 ( left ) and @entity123 , celebrates winning the @entity125 title with every season that passes his name seems to be linked with a bigger team			1
last year as he helped guide @entity31 to win the @entity129 the whispers started that @entity131 and @entity45 wanted him			2
last may as he helped guide @entity31 to @entity15 final glory in @entity133 , his name was mentioned as a possible long - term @entity53 manager			1
@entity135 also emerged as a candidate for his signature after the club decided not to continue with @entity139			2
the @entity53 link will not go away because of his late - father ’s playing career that included 470 first team appearances			0
the club won promotion back to the @entity11 on the same day @entity31 won their 10th @entity15 last may and he described the double triumph as “ the perfect day ”			1
two weeks ago it was even suggested that @entity147 are considering turning to @entity29 to replace @entity61 at the end of next season			1
' i think it ’s soon , ' he said last may when asked about when he would be making the step up to becoming a number one			0
' a few opportunities have come my way			0
but this [ @entity31 ] is a difficult place to leave			2
it ’s a great club , a great city , a great tradition and it gives you the opportunity to win things			0
' the former @entity163 puts the @entity164 through their paces ahead of a @entity167 match in march replacing @entity61 in two years would certainly make sense in terms of timing			0
while currently very happy and successful at @entity31 , managerial cycles at the @entity172 rarely last longer than three years so it would be time for @entity30 and his team to move on			1
@entity29 would have spent another two seasons alongside one of the most successful coaches in history and with some of the current crop at @entity31 two years older some might even be ready for a @entity11 swansong			1
asked last season if he would take a couple of @entity185 with him when he finally jumped ship he joked : ' that ’s what managers do , is n’t it ? ' @entity147 could probably do with a @entity139 and a @entity191 right now without having to wait until the end of next season			0
brilliant no 2s do n’t always make top no 1s but @entity147 have shown they are willing to take managerial risks in the past – they plucked @entity61 from the @entity197 two decades ago after all			0
and there will be other clubs ready to take the gamble			0
@entity29 has worked with some of the biggest names in football , including @entity203 ( right ) @entity29 will not be holding his breath a phone call – from @entity147 or from anyone else , he has plenty on his plate with the aim of becoming the first team to retain the @entity15 the club ’s big aim			1
after last season ’s @entity214 final chat with reporters sparked stories of his imminent departure @entity92 got in contact with the 42 - year - old coach to see how far down the line exit plans were and the ' it ’s @entity31 for me ' was the brief but to the point answer			0
it looks like being that way for the foreseeable future , but he will not be there forever , and as one of @entity40 ’s most wanted managers - in - the - making there will be no shortage of suitors when the time comes			0
@entity29 gestures alongside @entity30 during a @entity11 match against @entity236 in 2011			1

@entity29 won the @entity15 with @entity31 in may
@entity239 has followed @entity30 to @entity38 and @entity56
@entity29 has been linked with moves to @entity135 and @entity147
