when @entity1 , 44 , was warned that he only had five years to live if he failed to lose weight , he envisaged a life spent munching salads while watching wife @entity5 eating whatever she liked			1
but his wife had other ideas and now both halves of the couple , who hail from @entity12 in @entity13 , getting his and hers gastric bands			0
since the operation , the heavyweight couple have lost an astonishing 23st between them and say the surgery was the best thing they ever did			2
@entity1 and @entity21 got joint gastric bands after he was told he would die within five years and she was told she could n't have hip surgery if she did n't lose six stone the 2010 operation came after their £ 200 - a - week takeaway habit left both severely overweight and tipping the scales at a combined 55st			1
mrs @entity21 , 43 , who met her husband while on a rugby tour , says they were eating around 7,000 calories a day but doing nothing to burn it off			2
' we were having takeaway every night of the week , ' added mr @entity1			1
' sometimes we 'd even have it two or three times in a day			0
' mr @entity1 's problems began after he had knee surgery , which stopped him exercising and left him struggling to beat the bulge			1
tipping the scales at nearly 32 stone , he was told he only had five years to live if he did n't take drastic action			2
'' i knew i had to do something , ' he recalls			0
' i went to the @entity46 but i could n't get the surgery there so we decided to go private			2
' at his biggest , @entity1 weighed 32st and said he struggled to keep the weight off after a knee operation @entity5 needed to have a hip operation but was told she would n't be able to have it until she had lost five stone the joint operation cost the couple their £ 19,000 life savings , although they did receive a £ 1,000 discount for booking two procedures			1
although mrs @entity21 's life was n't in danger , she wanted to have the operation for health reasons and to help her lose 6st			1
in the event , the couple had their operations in the same day with mrs @entity21 booked in at 9am and her husband going in two hours later at 11am			2
following the joint operation , the couple were forced to cut their calories from nearly 7000 a day to just 500			2
as a result , mrs @entity21 now weighs a relatively slimline 16st , while operations manager mr @entity1 weighs 17st 5lb			1
it took just one month for the couple to each lose 3st , although mr @entity1 says slimming down was n't always easy			1
' it really helped having each other , ' he explains			0
' i definitely do n't think we could have done it on our own			0
it must be really hard for people doing it on their own			0
@entity5 is now happy with her weight and the couple have no plans to have their bands removed @entity1 says he would n't mind losing another stone but he is happy with what he has achieved so far ' for the first six to eight months we really struggled and for the first three , i really suffered from depression			1
' it was really tough and i did n't know if i was going to get through it but i had a great team of doctors who really helped me			0
' ' i had my procedure at the same time as @entity1 so we have been on the weight loss journey together , ' added his wife			1
' i have lost around 5st and @entity1 has lost 16st – or the equivalent of more than 100 bags of sugar as i like to remind him			2
' the couple have lost nearly 23 stone between them and are now happy with their weight mrs @entity21 says she also found her reduced diet a struggle at times but says having her husband going through the same thing with her made all the difference			1
' you have to get used to what you can and ca n't eat we were going from around 7000 calories a day to about 1000 , ' adds her husband			0
' it 's things like going out for dinner with your family - you ca n't just order a big meal , you have to have a starter			0
' even then it takes you as long to eat as it takes everyone else to get through a three course meal			0
' but despite the reduced diets , mr @entity1 says he would n't have the gastric band removed			1
' it is hard but i would n't have it removed , ' he confirms			0
' i got to have a check up every month just to make sure everything is ok			0
i 'm hoping to lose one more stone but i feel happy i 've already lost so much			0
