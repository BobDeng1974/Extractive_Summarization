a woman in her 70s may be forced to sell her childhood home to fund her elderly mother ’s care after losing a landmark court case that could have implications for families across @entity9			1
theatre director @entity10 has been told by judges that the house , where she has recently invested £ 40,000 in renovations , was not her home at the time when her mother went into care because she rents a flat in @entity20			1
miss @entity21 , 75 , has spent two years fighting @entity22 over whether the £ 205,000 house should be used to recover the cost of her mother ’s care			1
@entity10 ( left ) has been embroiled in a legal battle with @entity22 since her mother @entity28 ( right ) moved to a care home in 2006			1
the theatre director intended to retire to the property now the council has won the right to force miss @entity21 to use the equity in the house , where she intended to retire , for care home fees , which can be up to £ 600 a week			1
solicitors warned that the case could pave the way for relatives across the country to be liable for their parents ’ care			2
@entity44 , an associate at @entity22 legal firm @entity45 , said : ‘ this was a very significant judgment and one which will affect many in similar situations			2
’ when her mother @entity21 , now aged 100 , was admitted into care in 2006 , the council agreed that the house in @entity55 should not be taken into account during means testing			1
but in 2013 they reversed their decision and said that @entity60 would need to begin contributing towards bills			0
frustrated by the u-turn , miss @entity21 became embroiled in a legal battle with the council which was taken to the @entity65 in january 2014			1
miss @entity21 said she had always planned to retire to her mother 's house in @entity68 - upon - @entity69 ( above ) there , a judge ruled that her home should not be taken into account when means testing was carried out on her mother ’s finances			1
in his ruling , @entity77 concluded : ‘ a “ home ” is a place to which a person has a degree of attachment both physical and emotional			0
’ but the council took the case to the @entity86 , arguing that although the property may be her home , it was not at the time her mother was taken into care			2
yesterday miss @entity21 said : ‘ i am now in a position where i will almost certainly have to sell my home to pay for my mother ’s care bills which will leave me homeless			1
i have no energy or money left to fight them			0
’ @entity100 has been in the family for decades and was built by her grandmother ’s aunt in the mid- 1800s			0
miss @entity21 ’s car is parked in the drive , her belongings fill the bedrooms and she has an office where she carries out her work			2
yet she is often posted across the globe and , when working on national productions , needs to be based in @entity20			0
as a result @entity60 rents a bedsit owned by a friend in the centre of the capital			0
miss @entity21 , who has never married and has no children , said : ‘ @entity100 is my home			2
i have lived there since i was 13			0
‘ i pay council tax , the electricity bills and have spent £ 42,000 renovating it			0
it was always my intention to retire in the house			0
a judge at the @entity86 ruled in favour of @entity22 in january			2
earlier the @entity65 ( above ) had sided with the @entity21 family ‘ it is quite simply my home and it is going to be sold from underneath me			1
@entity127 knows how many other people will face the same heartache following this ruling			0
’ in the @entity86 hearing on december 9 last year , her barrister @entity131 argued that the only reason his client did not permanently live at @entity135 was because her work ties her to @entity20			2
by saying that the house would have been miss @entity21 ’s residence had she not worked in @entity20 , the council was discouraging people over the age of 60 from working , mr @entity131 argued			1
despite the submissions , two out of three judges ruled in the council ’s favour			0
lord @entity146 , who rejected the council ’s appeal , said he saw ‘ no reason ’ to assess whether the property was miss @entity21 ’s home based on a ‘ historic ’ date			1
yesterday a @entity154 spokesman said : ‘ this was an important legal challenge and we are pleased that the @entity86 ruled in our favour			0
‘ there are ever increasing demands being made on the public purse and it is important that decisions about how public money is used to support individuals are fair and consistent			0

@entity10 , 75 , grew up in her parents ' house in @entity55 - upon - @entity69
the theatre director 's mother mary was forced to move into care in 2006
@entity22 tried to sell the house to pay for her care
but miss @entity21 fought them , claiming the property was hers to retire to
@entity65 sided with the @entity21 family who were allowed to keep house
but its decision was overturned in the @entity86 earlier this year
now the council will decide whether or not to put the house on the market
