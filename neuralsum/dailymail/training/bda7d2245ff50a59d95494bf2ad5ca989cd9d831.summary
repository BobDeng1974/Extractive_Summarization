by @entity1 reporter the number of people with diabetes in @entity5 has reached an all - time high – with over four million people now living with the disease			1
currently , 3.2million have been diagnosed with diabetes – over 90 per cent with the obesity - related @entity9 – but over 850,000 more are unaware they have the deadly condition			1
however , this is only set to get worse as the country fails to tackle the ‘ epidemic ’ rates of obesity , the @entity13 warns			1
record : the number of people with diabetes in @entity5 has reached an all - time high - at more than four million the @entity22 predicts that the proportion of people with diabetes will jump from 7.3 per cent of the population in 2012 to 8.8 per cent by 2030			1
now , people aged between 40 and 74 in @entity27 are being urged to have an @entity28 to spot the first signs of the disease			2
the checks could also highlight certain diets or lifestyles that may lead to diabetes , or spot other illnesses , such as heart disease or kidney failure			2
since the programme was launched in 2009 , the @entity22 estimates it has prevented 1,600 heart attacks and strokes , at least 650 premature deaths and more than 4,000 new cases of diabetes each year			2
concern : the number is only set to get worse as the @entity5 fails to tackle the ' epidemic ' rates of obesity , the @entity13 warns ( file picture ) early detection of diabetes allows patients to respond by managing the illness to stop it from getting worse			1
but campaigners argue prevention is better than a cure - and efforts must be made to stop people developing the disease in the first place			1
last year , more than 1.3 million @entity63 patients people took an @entity28			0
@entity27 ( @entity64 ) is trying to raise awareness of the programme to mark diabetes @entity5 ’s annual @entity67			1
patient @entity68 was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes after his gp carried out the check			2
he said : ' through the @entity28 i received an early diagnosis and treatment			0
i was encouraged to take control of my own health and now no longer need insulin , thanks to a healthy diet and regular exercise			0
' communities that may be at a higher risk of certain conditions , like diabetes , may not be aware of the benefits a simple @entity28 can have			0
' professor @entity86 , the @entity64 's director of health and wellbeing , said : ' with type 2 diabetes becoming more common , the @entity28 presents an opportunity for individuals to take steps earlier , such as weight control , to prevent or even reverse diabetes in its early stages			0
' it is important that those eligible take up the offer of an @entity28 so their risk of serious , but potentially avoidable conditions , can be assessed , leading to early intervention			0
' @entity64 is committed to increasing physical activity and reducing physical inactivity across @entity27 and these aims are prominent in a number of public health campaigns			0
' @entity108 , @entity109 chief executive , said there are currently 630,000 people living with undiagnosed type 2 diabetes			1
' the sooner we can identify them , the sooner they can start getting the support and healthcare they need to manage the condition , ' she said			0
support : people aged between 40 and 74 in @entity27 are being urged to have an @entity28 to spot the first signs of the disease , or other deadly illnesses such as heart disease and kidney failure ( file picture ) ' at the moment many people who could benefit from the @entity28 are missing out on the opportunity , we would urge anyone aged 40 - 74 to get one			1
it could be one of the best things you ever do for your health			0
' but @entity136 of the @entity137 said : ' it ’s important that everyone wakes up to the real risk of diet - related diseases like diabetes and heart disease , not just for the overweight and obese who are at greater risk			2
' we wo n’t solve this growing epidemic of non-communicable diseases until we have tackled the fundamental problem of providing affordable healthy food and break the junk food habit generations have grown up with			0
' the urgent challenge is not simply to tell the over 40s to have a health check to get treatment for the rest of their lives , but most importantly to deal with prevention early in life			0
' there is a lag between weight gain increasing the risk for type 2 diabetes , the disease taking effect and then being diagnosed and treated			2
' there is a real price to pay for having failed over so many years to address this			0
' we know that researchers found remarkable differences in the number of adults under 80 already dying from diabetes - 50 per cent more in @entity176 than in some others parts of the country			1
' and the 3.2 million diagnosed with type 2 diabetes is just the tip of the iceberg given @entity5 continues to have an unhealthy diet and little is really being done to introduce effective measures to combat this			1

number of people living with diabetes in @entity5 has reached all - time high
currently , 3.2million in country have been diagnosed with deadly disease
however , more than 850,000 people are unaware they have the condition
and this is only set to get worse as @entity5 fails to tackle obesity , @entity13 warns
