' i 'm definitely going to be reconsidering my shopping habits , and i hope others do too			0
' i do like bananas , but i 'm going to think twice about where i buy them from			2
' since posting the video on @entity14 last week , the clip has attracted an astonishing two million views and been shared more than 30,000 times the @entity49 website shows that vegetables and fruit bought from @entity3 tends to be cheaper when bought individually rather than in a packet			1
pink lady apples x 4 - £ 2 ( 50p each ) pink lady apple single - 47.5p bag of oranges x 5 - £ 2 ( 40p each ) @entity57 loose - 25p kiwi fruit x4 - £ 1.65 ( 41.3p each ) @entity58 loose - 24p lemons x 5 - £ 1.50 ( 30p each ) @entity60 loose - 25p red onions x 4 - £ 1 ( 25p each ) red onion loose - 9.8p on @entity3 's website , the £ 1 bag of five bananas are advertised as costing only 20p each , while loose bananas , under their ' @entity67 ' guarantee , are set at 68p per kilo			1
if somebody were to take a banana to work every day for a year , buying the bags of them would cost £ 52 annually , while buying five loose fruits a week would come to around £ 28 , depending on their weight			1
elsewhere , other pre-bagged fruit and vegetables , such as potatoes , apples , tomatoes and pears , were either always cheaper or the same price			0
an @entity3 in @entity83 , @entity84 , saw a £ 1 bag of onions weigh in at 69p			1
however , it was a @entity87 in @entity88 , in @entity84 which saw the biggest price difference , with a £ 1 bag of onions weighing in at just 30p and a £ 1 bag of bananas weighing 59p			1
but today @entity3 defended its pre-packaged bananas , justifying the extra cost because they are ' perfect to eat '			1
a spokesman for the supermarket chain said : ' the majority of bananas we sell are loose which require a little bit of ripening at home and are price locked at 68p per kilo			2
' our pre-packed bananas are stored for a little longer and have already been ripened so they 're perfect to eat as soon as you 've bought them , they are then pre packed by hand , which is why they 're slightly more expensive			1
a pack of @entity114 which are priced at 79p , but if they are weighed they would cost 58p , a 21p difference ' we clearly label the prices in store , so customers can choose which product is best for them			1

this sort of thing happens all the time			0
' supermarkets are very good at creating an illusion that they give people good value for food , but they give with one hand and take with the other			2
' they give you the idea that you are getting a bargain when often it is the opposite			0
but we trust them not to lie to us			0
' they use price and promotion to confuse consumers and you only tend to notice if you are vigilant			0
' she added : ' you should never believe any supermarket promotion			0
if you think you are getting a good deal , you should act with suspicion and cynicism			0
' @entity154 , who writes the @entity157 ’s @entity156 blog , told @entity127 : ‘ supermarkets often have deals on their pre-packaged fruit and veg to lure shoppers into thinking they ’re getting a great price			0
' but what many people do n’t know is that buying pre-packaged fruit and veg can cost you nearly twice as much as buying the same fruit and veg individually			0
' i recently tested this at @entity173			0
it sells £ 1 bags , with five bananas in each bag			1
i weighed up a bag to see how much the bananas would have cost if i had bought five individually – it was 55p			1
