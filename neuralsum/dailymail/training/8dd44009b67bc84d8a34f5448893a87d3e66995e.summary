by @entity0 published : 18:06 est , 8 january 2014 updated : 07:42 est , 9 january 2014 @entity2 pledged to crack down on fixed odds betting machines , dubbed the ‘ crack cocaine ’ of the @entity5 yesterday			1
the prime minister branded the machines , on which punters can lose up to £ 300 a minute , ‘ a problem ’ and called for cross party support for action when a review of the dangers reports back in the @entity15			1
mr @entity2 intervened after @entity16 forced a vote in the @entity18 on plans outlined by @entity20 to give councils more powers to restrict the spread of the machines , which carry electronic roulette			1
but the prime minister said mr @entity20 had a ‘ reasonable point ’ when he said the machines were harming families and communities but also called for councils to use existing powers more rigorously if they have a problem			1
as a first move , culture minister @entity43 used the debate to announce that the betting industry will introduce new controls on high - stakes betting machines at the end of march			1
culture minster @entity43 has charged the @entity51 's five largest bookmakers to make changes she told the @entity53 she has challenged the five largest @entity51 bookmakers to implement precautionary player protection measures on the machines			2
‘ there ’s going to be precautionary protections placed by the industry at the end of march and then we will do whatever is needed to make sure people are protected			2
' i challenged them to develop a plan to link players with play in a way that allows us to better understand player behaviour and to assess the effectiveness of harm mitigation measures			0
’ she added : ‘ i ’m not prepared to delay taking action			0
’ according to the @entity76 , there are more than 33,000 of the fixed odds terminals making over £ 1.2 billion every year			1
while the @entity78 limited the terminals to four per betting shop , @entity16 says bookmakers have simply opened more branches to get around the restrictions			0
mr @entity2 told @entity32 : ‘ this is a problem , it does need looking at , we have a review under way			1
frankly we are clearing up a situation that was put in place under the last government but i think if we work together we can probably sort it out			0
‘ i think you are making a reasonable point but first we ’ll just deal with the facts			0
councils already have powers to tackle the issues and i believe that councils should make full use of that power			0
i ’m not arguing that is job done , there may well be more to do			0
’ @entity16 claims action could be taken before the review by putting betting shops in a separate class of building use so councils can use planning powers to restrict new premises opening			0
mr @entity20 disputed the prime minister ’s claim that councils have the power to tackle the spread of the machines			2
he said @entity121 mayor @entity120 and the @entity123 chairman of the @entity124 had both called for local authorities to be given more powers			2
‘ one in three calls to the gambling helpline is about these machines and they are clustered in deprived areas , ’ said mr @entity20			1
the bookmakers appeared to give ground last night			0
@entity134 , chairman of the @entity135 , said : ‘ we accept that there are concerns about gaming machines and are always open to a constructive dialogue with politicians about the appropriate powers for local authorities			2
@entity20 has said that one in three calls to the gambling helpline is about automated machines which are clustered in deprived areas ‘ the betting industry does not target deprived areas and is committed to doing everything it can to help society tackle problem gambling			1
' that is why we are cooperating in full with the government review already underway			0
it is also the reason why we recently brought forward a new code of conduct for player protection and responsible gambling			0
’ representatives from the gambling industry are due to meet ministers at the end of this month to detail what progress they have made in fulfilling ms @entity43 ’s requests			0
@entity166 mp @entity165 , an ally of the bookmaking industry , attacked @entity16 for condemning pursuits enjoyed by the poor			0
he said : ‘ this is basically middle - class people being patronising to working - class people , telling them that they know best on how they should spend their money			1
’ but @entity175 , public affairs adviser for @entity176 , demanded immediate action : ‘ the government already possesses sufficient evidence to take action on highly addictive gambling machines and local authorities lack adequate powers to say no to betting shops			2
‘ every year in the @entity51 people lose more than £ 1 billion on @entity186 ; problem gamblers lose nearly £ 300 million a year on these machines			1
' we believe these official statistics clearly demonstrate that these gambling machines are a problem which demands action			1

@entity2 has branded machines a ' problem '
he has called for cross party support after report in @entity15
fixed - odds machines allow people to lose up to £ 300 a hour
one in three calls to gambling helplines relate to machines
