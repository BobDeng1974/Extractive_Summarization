for three years @entity0 found herself continually mistaken for someone else			1
@entity0 , a waitress from @entity3 in @entity4 , southern @entity5 , was puzzled by the number of people who approached and spoke to her as if they knew her			1
they would ask her about her work in @entity13 , mistake her for the daughter - in - law of a complete stranger or ask why she did not recognise them			0
however , @entity0 had never before seen any of them in her life			1
likeness : @entity5 twins , @entity21 ( left ) and @entity0 , were separated at birth but found each other by accident many years later the 24 - year - old vowed to tracked down her mysterious doppelganger and was stunned to find she had an identical twin sister who was separated from her at birth			1
@entity0 's incredible journey of discovery began in june 2009 , when she was helping a relative run his fruit stand when four grannies approached her			2
' you have come back from @entity13 ? why did n't you inform us ? , ' one commented when a confused @entity0 asked who they were , another scoffed : ' you must earn big money , and do n't want to know us			2
' just a few months later a middle - aged man approached @entity0 , who worked as a cashier in a restaurant in @entity3 and told her : ' you look absolutely identical to one of my relatives			1
' happy : @entity46 ( left ) and @entity21 even have similar smiles the sisters share similar tastes , mannerisms , personalities and even have husbands with the same name not long after a confused teenager dining at the restaurant approached @entity0 and said , ' @entity21 , you work here now ? ' @entity0 decided to search for this mysterious @entity21 but soon after fell pregnant and had to put the plan on hold			1
the married mother - of - one said : ' the idea to look for her was always in my mind			0
i wanted to look for her after my son got a bit bigger			0
' in the end it was three years before @entity0 was able to start her search for her ringer			2
confusion : @entity0 ( left ) was always being mistaken for @entity21 and decided to track her down friends : the sisters quickly became close despite the gulf of years since their seperation family : @entity0 ( top left ) and @entity21 with @entity21 's adoptive parents @entity21 and her adopted parents			1
the twins quickly realised they had been separated at birth and sent to live with different families in october @entity0 was once again mistaken for @entity21 at work but she saw her opportunity and managed to get the woman 's address from the diner			1
last month @entity87 , also of @entity3 , was playing with her son at home when she suddenly heard her mother - in - law shout , ' @entity21 , come here now ! ' @entity21 was alarmed by her mother - in - law 's urgent tone and when she ran out a woman was standing with her back to her and suddenly turned around			2
@entity21 was shocked - @entity0 was almost identical to her			1
the married mother - of - one , said : ' i felt i was looking into the mirror			0
' @entity0 added : ' we felt like we had known each other for years and years			2
' @entity21 's son ( left ) bears an uncanny resemblance to his cousin ( right ) childhood injury @entity21 and @entity0 also have almost identical scars from accidents when they were both just six the sisters were stunned at the number of similarities , including fashion , hobbies and even foods it emerged both @entity21 and @entity0 were adopted as babies and have realised that they must have been twins who were separated at birth			1
there are many uncanny similarities between the sisters beyond their physical likeness			0
they both got married in 2007 , both of their husbands have the same given name , @entity123 , and their sons also look identical			2
they have the same voice , same friendly , out - going personality , share a number of hobbies , a similar style of dressing , and enjoy the same foods			0
they even have the same scar on their finger after having similar accidents when they were six			0
baby girls are often given up for adoption in @entity5 because of the @entity141 policy			0
boys are more valued in @entity5 society because they carry on the ancestral name and inheritance laws pass property on to sons			0
because of this hundreds of thousands of baby girls are abandoned every year in @entity5			0
twins , however , are exempt from the policy .			0

@entity0 was constantly mistaken for someone called ' @entity153 '
she tracked down @entity21 and was stunned to discover her identical twin
their lives have uncanny parallels , including husbands with the same name
