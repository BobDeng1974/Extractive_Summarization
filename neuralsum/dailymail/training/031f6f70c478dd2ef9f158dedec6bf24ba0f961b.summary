by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 09:14 est , 13 september 2012 updated : 05:37 est , 14 september 2012 the commons could sit in the @entity3 or @entity4 while mps are made homeless to allow major building work to be carried out on the @entity7			1
at least £ 1bn of maintenance is needed to remove asbestos , repair brickwork and upgrade water and electricity supplies			2
commons officials claim trying to do the work in parts while mps and peers are on holiday could take years , and cost billions more			1
hitting the road : mps will have to leave the @entity21 of @entity22 for £ 1 billion of work to be carried out today @entity16 lined up to back the idea of hitting the road , and suggested alternative sites			1
@entity27 , speaking for the @entity21 , said ‘ all options can be placed on the table ’			0
he added : ‘ from my experience i have found it is usually better to leave for two years , or whatever , and get the job done , than be inconvenienced and unable to work properly for 10 years			2
’ it had been thought that if mps did vacate the famous green benches it would be to a site nearby , possibly in the shadow of the @entity40 clock tower or across the road the @entity43 conference centre			0
the @entity45 chamber would stand empty while the repairs are carried out one mp wants to move @entity22 to @entity48 ( left ) which would be a change in style to the @entity51 but mr @entity27 said he was willing to consider ideas from mps that they look further afield			1
@entity57 mp @entity56 , who left government in last week ’s reshuffle , said made a ‘ shameless bid that if @entity22 is going to decant , it decants to @entity4 ’			0
the mp for nearby @entity62 added : ‘ why not , it 's our second city ? ’ but @entity66 @entity65 made a rival bid for her part of @entity69 , claiming the @entity71 media centre in @entity72 , where she is mp , could be a ‘ fantastic facility ’ ‘ while awaiting a tenant ( it ) could happily house @entity22 in the interim while the work is done , with a seven - minute shuttle to @entity78 , @entity79 on the doorstep , excellent transport links , 20 minutes to @entity7			1
‘ would the @entity21 consider a temporary relocation of @entity22 to ' eastminster ' ? ’ one idea being considered by @entity45 officials is moving @entity22 to the @entity85 in the @entity3 mps would be able to take a dip in the @entity71 pool during breaks between debates if they moved to @entity91 a report into what work needs to be done – and how long it will take – is being finalised			1
parliamentary officials are struggling to find a cost effective way of carrying out the repairs while @entity22 continues to function on site			2
in the @entity45 today no mp spoke against the idea of a shipping out of @entity7			1
asked about the final bill for the building work , mr @entity27 admitted it is ‘ difficult at this stage to make a proper assessment of cost ’			0
major work has not been carried out on the building 's interior since it was bombed in 1941			0
@entity110 mp @entity27 ( right ) said major work had not been carried out since the building was repaired after being bombed in 1941 he added : ‘ what the commission will do is ensure it pursues the best value for money , being the combination of the lowest cost option with keeping @entity22 functioning properly			0
’ the houses of @entity22 in @entity7 cost about £ 30m a year to run			2
each month the @entity22 relocates from its @entity120 base to sit in @entity121			0
but many @entity123 politicians have criticised the £ 200m annual cost of the rotation .			0

asbestos , *leaking* pipes and *bad* *wiring* need *replacing*
too much work to complete while @entity45 is empty for *summer* holidays
@entity16 try to persuade officials to move from @entity7 to ' @entity134 '
