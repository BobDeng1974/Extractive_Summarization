by @entity0 now read @entity2 's full match report from @entity4 here however much @entity5 and @entity6 might have in common , and however close their two teams might have been in terms of points prior to this encounter , here was a @entity13 derby that highlighted the gulf that still remains			1
it is a gulf in quality and resources on the pitch			0
a gulf that means @entity20 can boast one of the finest front lines in @entity23 , all bought and paid for thank you very much , while @entity26 are still picking up bargains in the loan market			1
take nothing away from @entity5 and his players here at @entity4			1
they were magnificent ; a superb attacking force that demonstrated to devastating effect that , of the two teams in residence either side of @entity38 , they are the better equipped to challenge for a @entity40 place this season			0
that @entity6 had to turn to @entity62 as a replacement really said as much as the fact that @entity59 remains a 20 - year - old on loan from @entity67			1
rather than throw money at @entity53 , @entity26 ’s supporters might have been better served donating it to their club			2
@entity59 ’s premature departure does not explain how @entity26 proved so ineffective in containing @entity20 ’s forwards when they came here to @entity4 having lost only twice in the @entity56 this season			1
but a team lacking any real punch at one end will always suffer at the other and so it was for an @entity26 side left crushed by their rampant rivals			1
off to a flyer : @entity20 surged into a 3 - 0 lead at the break over @entity26 at @entity4 there were other issues for @entity6			1
as well as the absence of @entity90 and @entity91 in his back four , it was clear that @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 were lacking fitness after their recent injury problems			0
but this remained an uncharacteristic performance from @entity26 and one that @entity6 will not be prepared to accept whatever obstacles they had to overcome			1
he expects his team to be organised and disciplined			0
@entity104 , another loan signing it is worth remembering , had been brilliant for @entity6 but he had a night he will certainly want to forget			2
not only was he at fault for two of @entity20 ’s goal , it was his collision with @entity59 that left the @entity112 forward leaving the field on a stretcher			1
for the two managers it meant this derby was much like their respective exits from @entity118			2
joyous for one and bloody uncomfortable for the other			0
while @entity5 was thanked for guiding the club into the @entity56 before heading off to @entity4 , the circumstances of @entity6 ’s departure were rather more acrimonious			1
in 2009 @entity6 planned to marry in the @entity125 city , and such was his popularity as the football club ’s forward - thinking manager he and his future wife found that nobody would take their money for organising their nuptials			1
until , that is , he announced his intention to move to @entity136			0
suddenly the bills started coming through the letter box and by the time they arrived at their wedding day they needed the assistance of @entity145 police to ensure that there was no trouble at the church			0
roaring success : @entity53 celebrates after getting in on the act in a comfortable win finesse : @entity53 is already wheeling away as he rolls the ball past @entity153 that anger and resentment has now subsided , to be fair , and @entity118 supporters would probably agree that the two managers who played such an important role in their rise to the top flight share certain qualities			2
@entity6 introduced a continental style of play @entity5 also subscribed to when he took control at @entity165 and it is fascinating to see these two men now applying those same principles here on @entity13			1
but this was not the best night for making those comparisons			0
they are similar even if one is @entity173 and the other @entity174			0
they are virtually the same age , they rank among the sharper dressed @entity56 managers , and they have an appetite for flair and adventure as well as a tactical , methodical approach			0
lethal : @entity54 coolly strokes his effort past @entity153 in the first half the derby back in november at @entity185 was a better example of the philosophies they share ; a 3 - 3 draw that was memorable for some stunning attacking football by both teams			2
here at @entity4 last night they certainly started with the intent of producing a spectacle at the same high - octane level , with both men opting for the same 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 formation			1
in red and blue there are players to thrill and inspire too			0
@entity53 and @entity93 for a start			0
bad night : @entity59 struggles off the pitch after colliding with @entity104 but by the time @entity53 had raced away from @entity92 to score @entity20 ’s fourth , @entity6 could only look in in agony ; his arms folded , his glare fixed on players and his jaw going ten to a dozen on a piece of gum			1
it was not as bad as that day in @entity118			2
there will be no need for police protection here			0
but to be an @entity26 manager on the end of a thumping like this is no fun at all			2
and certainly not the night for celebrating the respective qualities of two fine young managers in @entity20			2
better to focus on two very fine forwards , from @entity222 and @entity223			0
as well as one or two others in red .			0

both @entity5 and @entity6 *previously* the @entity118 job
@entity5 left in amicable circumstances but @entity6 's departure was *slightly* more acrimonious
@entity5 ' @entity20 thrashed @entity6 's @entity26 4 - 0 at @entity4
*toffees* have not won away against @entity20 since 1999
