by @entity1 reporter published : 20:29 est , 25 october 2013 updated : 20:29 est , 25 october 2013 for a lot of football fans , they have a specific shirt they wear on game days - a game - day shirt to show support for their team			0
but for a @entity15 6th grader , his game - day shirt is his every day shirt			0
@entity17 , of @entity18 , is a die - hard @entity19 fan and his favorite player is quarterback @entity21			1
so , when @entity17 received an @entity21 jersey for @entity23 a few years ago , he started wearing it every day			2
that was 1,035 days ago - and he 's worn it every day since			2
@entity28 fan : @entity17 has worn his @entity21 jersey every day for the last 1,035 days hero : @entity21 helped the @entity19 win the @entity31 - right around the time @entity17 got his jersey ' everyone asks , '' is he still wearing the shirt ? '' yes , he 's still wearing the shirt , ' his mother , @entity36 , told @entity38			1
now , @entity17 is trying to break the record for most consecutive days wearing a @entity19 jersey			1
' i made the mistake of mentioning the boy that had worn the @entity47 jersey just over four years and at that point he said , '' hm , is there a record ? '' and i said , '' i do n't know if there 's a record for an @entity21 jersey , '' so he said , '' well , i 'm going to try and break the record , ' " his father , @entity41 , says			2
the jersey , however , hardly resembles a @entity19 jersey at this point - it 's so badly worn that you can hardly make out the @entity19 logo , or @entity21 ' name or number			1
worn : @entity17 's jersey is so worn that you can barely see @entity21 ' name on the back the war at home : @entity17 is the lone @entity19 fan in a family of @entity71 fans , @entity19 's biggest rival but there 's a twist : @entity17 's entire family are @entity71 fans , the heated rivals of @entity17 's beloved @entity19			1
' being a @entity71 family we tried to convert him , but once we knew he was n't going to convert we said ok , ' his father said			0
while the rest of the @entity17 's home is dedicated to the @entity71 , @entity17 's bedroom resembles a shrine to the @entity19 - it even has a @entity19 logo painted on the wall that @entity17 's father swallowed his pride and painted for his young son			2
' i told my friends so they did n't think i turned into a @entity19 fan that i wore my @entity71 jersey while i painted ( the @entity19 logo ) it on the wall , ' @entity90 said			0
merry @entity23 : @entity17 got his jersey as a @entity23 gift - nearly three years ago ! as far as basic hygiene goes , the @entity100 say they hand - wash @entity17 's jersey every other day to keep it from smelling			0
@entity17 has more than a year to go if he plans to break the record , and he hopes that when he does he 'll get to meet his hero @entity21			0
the @entity105 , however , have plans of their own - @entity17 's younger brother is on a mission of his own : to break the record for most consecutive days wearing a @entity71 jersey			1
according to the @entity100 , @entity17 's younger brother has worn his @entity71 jersey every day for the last several weeks .			0

@entity17 , a sixth - grader from @entity15 , has worn the same @entity21 jersey every day for 1,035 days
he 's trying to break the record of most consecutive days to wear a @entity19 jersey
in a twist , he is the lone @entity19 fan in a family of @entity71 fans , @entity19 's most heated rival
