a @entity1 court has ordered the release of @entity7 , the world 's longest serving death row inmate who has spent nearly 50 years behind bars , because evidence against him was likely to have been made up the court ordered a retrial for mr @entity7 , a former professional boxer , who was sentenced to death in 1968 presiding judge @entity37 said he was concerned that investigators could have planted evidence to win a conviction as they sought to bring closure to a crime that had shocked the country			1
‘ there is possibility that ( key pieces of ) evidence have been fabricated by investigative bodies , ’ mr @entity37 said in his ruling , according to @entity45			0
the court said today that dna analysis obtained by mr @entity7 's lawyers suggested that investigators had fabricated evidence			1
blood stains detected on five pieces of clothing , which investigators said were worn by the culprit during the crime , did not match the dna of @entity7 , and trousers that prosecutors submitted as evidence were too small for @entity7 and did not fit when he tried them on			2
@entity68 deputy chief prosecutor @entity67 said the ruling was unanticipated and that prosecutors would discuss whether to appeal to a higher court			2
it took 27 years for the @entity72 to deny his first appeal for a retrial			1
he filed a second appeal in 2008 , and the court finally ruled in his favour today			2

he retracted his confession , but to no avail , and the supreme court confirmed his death sentence in 1980			0

but the now - frail mr @entity7 has remained in solitary confinement on death row , regardless			1
his supporters and some lawyers , including the @entity118 , have loudly voiced their doubts about the evidence , the police investigations and the judicial logic that led to the conviction			0
even one of the judges who originally sentenced mr @entity7 to death in 1968 has said he was never convinced of the man 's guilt but could not sway his judicial colleagues who out - voted him			1
@entity1 has a conviction rate of around 99 per cent and claims of heavy - handed police interrogations persist under a long - held belief that a confession is the gold standard of guilt			2

@entity158 , @entity159 research director at @entity146 , said : ‘ the @entity1 authorities should be ashamed of the barbaric treatment @entity7 has received			1
‘ for more than 45 years he has lived under the constant fear of execution , never knowing from one day to the next if he is going to be put to death			1
this adds psychological torture to an already cruel and inhumane punishment			0
‘ it would be most callous and unfair of prosecutors to appeal the court ’s decision			2
@entity163 is running out for @entity7 to receive the fair trial he was denied more than four decades ago			0
' if ever there was a case that merits a retrial , this is it			0
