by @entity0 @entity2 's separation announcement may have surprised her fans tuesday , but her decision to call the divorce a ' conscious uncoupling ' wo n't surprise anyone who 's ever read her @entity9 lifestyle site			1

' @entity29 divorce : @entity2 's announcement she 'll be separating from husband of 10 years @entity14 was a surprise to fans , but her decision to label the divorce a ' conscious uncoupling ' -- a decision endorsed by her physician friend and lifestyle guru dr. @entity19 -- will shock no one conscious uncoupling - a private act : ' we have always conducted our relationship privately , and we hope that as we consciously uncouple and coparent , we will be able to continue in the same manner , ' @entity2 wrote on her @entity9 lifestyle site ' we have always conducted our relationship privately , ' @entity2 writes in a public announcement of the end of her marriage that immediately shut down her @entity9 site			1
' we hope that as we consciously uncouple and coparent , we will be able to continue in the same manner			0
' she lets drs. @entity19 and wife dr. @entity50 take it from there			1
' a conscious uncoupling is the ability to understand that every irritation and argument was a signal to look inside ourselves and identify a negative internal object that needed healing , ' they write			1
the couple say that every pet peeve and bit of resentment is ' just the echo of an older emotional injury			0
' ' from this perspective , ' they say , ' there are no bad guys , just two people , each playing teacher and student respectively			0
' to the fans : the announcement showed up on @entity2 's @entity9 site tuesday evening and immediately garnered so much traffic , the site shut down dr. @entity79 @entity2 's message about ' conscious uncoupling ' was followed up on her website with a lengthy explanation of the @entity29 divorce technique by a couple of doctors named @entity19 and @entity50			1
the couple live in @entity88 along with their son and daughter			0

' ' through a unique and individualized approach to healthcare that includes evidence - based , @entity100 medical interventions and intuitive @entity103 healing modalities , ' reads the bio on his clinic 's website , ' dr. @entity19 has been able to achieve astounding results in patient cases that were otherwise deemed hopeless by traditional medicine			1

' so why ca n't they use their evolved presence of mind to simply move past resentments and stay together ? according to the teachings of conscious uncoupling , humans simply are n't meant to stay married for so long			1
they point toward the exponential increase in lifespan that humans have experienced in the last century or so : ' we ’re living three lifetimes compared to early humans , perhaps we need to redefine the construct			0
