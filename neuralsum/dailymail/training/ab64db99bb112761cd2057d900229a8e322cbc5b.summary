by @entity0 it could have been the story of the year - ' @entity1 has tested positive for morphine '			1
unfortunately , however , it was little more than a well - timed screen grab			1
a picture appearing to show the @entity8 report that the @entity1 has tested positive for the drug morphine - and not her horse - is provoking much hilarity on @entity11			1
the screen grab - taken at an opportune moment as the rolling news text scrolled across the bottom of the screen - omitted the crucial first half of the sentence			1
really ? the @entity8 appeared to report that the @entity1 has tested positive for the drug morphine when this screen grab was taken - missing out key words estimate owned by the @entity1 tested positive for morphine , a prohibited substance , @entity22 said in its entirety , it would have read : ' a racehorse owned by the @entity1 has tested positive for morphine			1
' it was revealed last night that @entity31 , one of her majesty 's prize racehorses , had tested positive for the banned drug			1
@entity8 bosses seem to have seen the funny side of the joke - saying that usually viewers watch the news in whole , and not frame by frame			2
a spokesman said : ' the ticker on the @entity45 correctly showed the whole headline " a racehorse owned by the @entity1 has tested positive for morphine " as it scrolled along the screen			1
a screen grab has been taken which omits " a racehorse owned by " and only shows the rest of the sentence			2
' @entity31 , a five - year - old filly , failed the test when the painkiller morphine was found in a sample taken after a race , @entity22 said			0
trained by leading flat racing trainer sir @entity59 , @entity31 won the @entity60 last year - the first royal horse to win the prestigious race			2
a screen grab is doing the rounds on @entity11 - causing much hilarity she came second in this year ’s @entity60 last month , when the test is believed to have occurred			1
the revelation came five days after the @entity69 ( @entity69 ) announced that at least five horses , from various trainers , had tested positive for banned drugs following race meetings			1
it has begun an investigation			0
@entity76 is a permitted medication for racehorses but is banned on race days			2
initial indications are that @entity31 ’s positive test was caused by her eating contaminated feed , the @entity80 said			0
the queen has been informed			0
following the @entity69 ’s announcement , @entity88 - based feed manufacturer @entity86 and @entity89 , which has held a royal warrant since 1985 , said its suppliers had informed the company of possible contamination and it destroyed all of its stock of a feed called @entity98			0
estimate is pictured left on its way to winning the @entity60 at @entity101 in 2013 the @entity1 watched @entity31 win the @entity60 on @entity102 with her racing manager @entity103 in 2013 @entity103 , the @entity1 ’s bloodstock and racing adviser , said : ‘ sir @entity59 is working closely with the feed company involved to discover how the product may have become contaminated prior to delivery to his stables			2
‘ as the @entity69 investigates this matter , including potential links between the different cases , sir @entity59 continues to offer his full co-operation			0
’ once investigations are complete , the cases will be put before a @entity69 disciplinary panel which will decide if any should be taken			0
this could include disqualifying the horses involved from the races they had competed in			0
winning ways : @entity123 ( far right ) streaks past @entity31 ( centre , sheepskin noseband ) to take the @entity60 on @entity102 at @entity101 this year estimate , ridden by @entity127 , in action during of @entity129 at @entity101 in may 2013 if @entity31 did test positive after this year ’s @entity60 , the horse could be stripped of her second place and the @entity1 would forfeit the £ 80,625 prize			1
when @entity31 won last year ’s @entity60 , the @entity1 cheered her to victory and then joined jockey @entity127 and trainer sir @entity59 for the presentation – which had to be hastily rearranged as she had been due to hand over the trophy			0
the @entity139 stepped in to make the presentation to his mother , who also won £ 155,960 in prize money .			0
