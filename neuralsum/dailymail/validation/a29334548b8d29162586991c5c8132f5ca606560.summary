' the most important thing is not to concede a goal because obviously things then become more difficult			0
' strange things can happen			0
everybody wrote @entity49 off before they played @entity51 but they won 4 - 3 and could have scored again which would have put them through			0
' not many thought @entity55 could beat @entity56 , especially with only 10 men for so long , so i know that everything can happen , not only in the @entity12 but in every game			2
' everyone is expecting @entity5 to go through but hopefully we can give a strong performance and we do n't have any kind of pressure on us because we are behind and playing away			2

this time they are slightly better off following @entity72 's last - minute penalty save from @entity31 at the @entity73 three weeks ago			0
' we played well in the second leg against @entity5 last season and played with freedom so we will see , ' added @entity0			1

the 29 - year - old has insisted , however , that he is n't thinking about a move away from @entity1 and has enjoyed playing further up the field under @entity19 this season			2
' i have played closer to the box in a more advanced position this season and that 's why i 'm scoring goals , ' he said			0
@entity19 will look to perform a miracle on wednesday night against a powerful @entity5 side ' it 's more about the team than individuals			1
