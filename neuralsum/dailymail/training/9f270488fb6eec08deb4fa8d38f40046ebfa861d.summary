by @entity0 proposal : lord @entity2 , who previously advised @entity3 on health reform , said the levy should be paid before anyone receives free treatment everyone should pay a £ 10 - a - month fee to use the @entity10 , according to a former @entity12 health minister			1
lord @entity2 called for the levy to be paid before anyone could benefit from free treatment			1
patients should also be charged £ 20 for every night they stay in hospital , he added			2
he said the controversial measures would prevent a financial crisis in the @entity20 , which is struggling to meet the needs of the increasingly ageing , unhealthy population			2
there is rising concern that the @entity10 is running out of money and will soon have to resort to charging patients or rationing common treatments			1
lord @entity2 , who previously advised @entity3 on health reform , said the @entity10 was ‘ unaffordable ’ , ‘ out - of - date ’ and unable to meet the needs of the population			1
in a report written for the reform think - tank , he estimated that a monthly £ 10 charge for using the @entity10 would generate £ 2billion a year			1
certain groups would be exempt , including the elderly , the under - 18s and pregnant women			0
patients would not be denied emergency treatment if they had not paid the fee			1
lord @entity2 recommended introducing a £ 20 fee for every night a patient stays in hospital			1
they would be made to pay extra if their stay was longer than the average for their age group – broken down into the under - 65s , 65 to 85 and over- 85s			0
the fees would generate up to £ 1billion , while also deterring patients from going to hospital unnecessarily			0
lord @entity2 said there needed to be a ‘ tough conversation with the public ’ about new ways of funding the @entity20			1
need for change : the former minister also claimed the health service was ' unaffordable ' , ' out - of - date ' and unable to meet the needs of the population ‘ we can no longer pay homage to an out - of - date and unaffordable @entity10 that ’s unfit for today ’s and tomorrow ’s care needs , ’ he said			1
‘ all politicians allowed the @entity10 to overdose on higher budgets without shifting more care closer to home and concentrating our specialist services on fewer , safer , more highly - skilled , 24/7 centres			2
the day of reckoning has arrived with an obesity epidemic on our doorstep			0
‘ the @entity10 has to change radically			2
it should have no more hand - outs at the expense of other public services			0
’ but @entity76 , of campaign group @entity77 , was ‘ incensed ’ by his proposals			0
‘ hospitals are dreadful , unsafe places – why would anyone choose to stay there if they could help it ? it ’s not like they are hotels , ’ she said			0
‘ i ca n’t imagine who sat in their office and thought this up			0
it really is a strange idea			0
’ the @entity20 has been struggling to meet the demands of patients – even with its £ 106billion annual budget ring - fenced from spending cuts – and there have been growing calls for patients to be charged for certain services			0
in january , a poll of 800 gps found that a third were in favour of charging patients up to £ 10 every time they went to casualty to deter ‘ inappropriate attendances ’			0
last summer senior doctors from the @entity108 said the @entity10 would soon have to make patients pay for some non-urgent treatments and operations			2
the @entity112 – which represents managers – has also said patients may have to be charged for calling out a doctor and made to pay for hospital meals			0
a @entity12 source said the party rejected lord @entity2 ’s proposals			1
a @entity121 spokesman said : ‘ the founding principles of the @entity10 make it universally free at point of use and we are clear that it will continue to be so			1
