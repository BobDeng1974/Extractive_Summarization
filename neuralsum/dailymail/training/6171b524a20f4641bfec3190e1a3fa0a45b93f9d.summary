nine black men and one white woman were given prison sentences totaling nearly 300 years in the notorious civil rights - era prosecution that led to accusations that the state was holding political prisoners			1
@entity2 issued pardons of innocence today , which means the state no longer considers the 10 - four of whom have since died - guilty of a crime			1
wrongly convicted : the @entity4 10 , pictured in @entity21 in 1976 , were given prison sentences totaling nearly 300 years in the notorious civil rights - era prosecution that led to accusations that the state was holding political prisoners ' i have decided to grant these pardons because the more facts i have learned about the @entity4 10 , the more appalled i have become about the manner in which their convictions were obtained , ' @entity2 said in a news release			1
the three key witnesses in the case later recanted their testimony in the 1971 firebombing			1
@entity37 and other groups took up the issue , portraying the @entity40 as political prisoners			0
in 1978 , then - gov. @entity42 commuted their sentences but withheld a pardon			2
two years later , the 4th @entity46 @entity45 in @entity47 , @entity48 , threw out the convictions , saying perjury and prosecutorial misconduct were factors in the verdicts			2
' we are tremendously grateful to gov. @entity2 for her courage , ' said @entity56 , the former national @entity57 executive director who was in jail and prison for about five years before his release			1
' this is a historic day for @entity3 and the @entity46			2
people should be innocent until proven guilty , not persecuted for standing up for equal rights and justice			0
' pardoned : outgoing @entity3 gov. @entity2 signs pardons on monday to the @entity4 10 , a group wrongly convicted of firebombing a grocery store 40 years ago in addition to @entity56 , the surviving members of the @entity40 are @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75			1
those who have died are @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80			0
@entity80 was the youngest , arrested when he was 16 years old			0
the @entity40 were convicted in october 1972 on charges of conspiracy to firebomb @entity83 and conspiracy to assault emergency personnel who responded to the fire in february 1971			0
the trial was held in @entity88 in @entity89 after a judge declared a mistrial the first time			0

they showed the notes on a poster board , saying the handwriting on the legal paper appeared to match notes from other prosecution records in the case			2
at the top of the list of 100 jurors , the notes said , ' stay away from black men			1

the notes identify one potential black juror as an ' @entity141 type , ' and beside the names of several white people , notations include ' @entity122 ? ' and ' good ! ! ' @entity96 told the @entity145 of @entity4 that he wrote the notes but declined to confirm that to the @entity148 ' this conduct is disgraceful , ' @entity2 said of the notes			1
' it is utterly incompatible with basic notions of fairness and with every ideal that @entity3 holds dear			2
the legitimacy of our criminal justice system hinges on it operating in a fair and equitable manner with justice being dispensed based on innocence or guilt - not based on race or other forms of prejudice			0
