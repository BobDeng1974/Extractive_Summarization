the road to success for athletes is rarely a straightforward one			2
none more so than in the case of @entity7 sprinter @entity6 , who is still aiming for glory in @entity9 despite an injury - ravaged past three years			1
the 19 - year - old is taking an unconventional route to the top , picking up a part - time job in a supermarket to help make ends meet			1
while her contemporaries are focusing everything on training to get into peak condition , she is juggling athletics with working 12 hours per week in @entity20 ’s			1
it has cost her the funding to train and race			1
@entity6 had not competed enough to warrant funding last season and was just returning from injury and ready to get back on it this year when it was reallocated in november , only for stress fractures in her feet to rule her out again			1
she had dipped into savings to fund her past year , training in @entity52 and completing as levels in photography and art. but that money soon dried up			2
‘ i needed to get a job after the summer , i realised when i pulled out of the @entity58 there was no chance of getting back on the funding , ’ said @entity6 ( left )			1
‘ i had to run a fast time , which i was planning on doing at the @entity63			1
if my feet had n’t played up i was confident of doing that			2
‘ i knew it was n’t going to happen			2
i sat down with my parents and figured out what i was going to do			2
they ’re not rich , so they did n’t have money to help me			0
so i got a job in @entity20 ’s			1
they ’ve been really good			0
i told them i was an athlete and they said i can work when i want			1
’ running is all @entity6 has ever known and all she ever wanted to do , but , for this year at least , while rehabilitating from her latest injury then training hard to hone her technique in the 100m and 400m , she will also have to stack shelves and man tills			1
@entity6 is determined not to let her loss of funding hold her back from competing in @entity26 @entity6 ( centre ) pictured competing in the @entity81 heats of the @entity82 in @entity83 ‘ i was really nervous before my first shift , i was terrified , ’ she admitted			1
‘ i ’ve never had a job before because i ’ve always just run			0
last year i had all my funding saved , but all that saving was gone			2
‘ if i get back on it — when i get back on it — i ’ll be more grateful for it			0
the next opportunity will be november next year , so i ’ve got a year to get through			0
’ @entity6 is not letting this latest in a long line of setbacks stand in the way of her ambition to race and win medals at the 2016 @entity9			1
she remains confident of being able to compete at the highest level , provided she can finally get fit and then stay fit			0
but she is doing it the hard way			0
‘ it ’s really difficult , ’ she added			0
‘ at this point it ’s when i ’d need funding the most with all the rehab			2
’ @entity6 ( left ) has moved in with her boyfriend , @entity108 100m @entity107 gold medal winner @entity105 ( right ) @entity6 is being helped through it all by boyfriend @entity105 — the @entity7 gold medal winner — and by their new puppy			1
in september the pair moved in together in a terraced house just outside @entity52 , where they train , and added a third member to their family			0
‘ we got a little puppy called @entity121 , ’ said @entity6			1
‘ she ’s a @entity123 bulldog			0
i ’ve grown up and always had dogs			0
‘ we do n’t talk about athletics at home ! i love running and athletics but it ’s the last thing we want to talk about when we get home from training			0
