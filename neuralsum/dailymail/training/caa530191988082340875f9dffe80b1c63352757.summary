but @entity22 only has positive reviews of working at the @entity5 , and even admits enjoying some of the sex she had with forbes - listers , royalty , politicians , athletes , celebrities and industry titans			1
@entity22 says ' 90 per cent ' of her clients were attractive and influential people who did n't have to pay for sex but did it out of convenience or addiction			1
' in my dealings with clients , i often felt like they could be addicts , ' she said			1
' but i did n't mind , and it has never been my job to overthink it			2
' she adds that the work was n't always easy			2
most of the men she slept with made her do all the work in the bed			2
' that 's how all of my clients preferred it			2
i guess if i were paying $ 1,500 an hour , i would n't want to do any work either , ' she said			2
among her regular clients were ' professional gamblers and boxers , top - tier doctors and lawyers , high - flying finance types , an @entity62 professor and several successful entrepreneurs			1
' @entity22 liked being a prostitute because she could make more in one hour than seven hours dancing as a stripper , one of her previous occupations			2
' a high - end agency would allow me to take a break from the unhealthy world of gentlemen ’s clubs			1
i ’d need to meet with only one man instead of 40			2
i would n’t have to be around a group of vapid people in various stages of chemical alteration , and unlike the guys i had to approach at the club , i knew the men i ’d meet through a service would be guaranteed to want my company — they would have already handpicked me , ' she said			1
' i ’d also be able to get to bed at a reasonable time and get up in the morning with the rest of the normal world			0
' busted : @entity7 ( left ) resigned after it was revealed that he patronized the @entity5 , and consorted with prostitute @entity89 ( right ) client 9 : @entity22 worked at @entity5 with @entity89 ( pictured above ) , who went by the name @entity93 and was caught by federal investigators setting up ' meetings ' with @entity7 but her life of easy money came crashing down the day she received a phone call from agent @entity99 , asking to meet as soon as possible			1
@entity22 lawyered up and signed a proffer agreement to divulge everything she knew about the club to federal investigators			1
while she knew prostitution was against the law , @entity22 did n't know why she was being targeted			0
' i felt violated and confused			0
why was it anyone ’s business what i did in my private life ? i had n’t hurt anyone			0
i helped women with strollers down subway stairs			0
' i was made to feel as though i had done something truly horrible			0
but i knew with every fiber of my being that i had done nothing wrong			0
in fact , i ’m still unsure what “ crime ” was ever committed			0
' @entity22 ended up having to pay her lawyer $ 25,000 to settle the issue			0
after the end of the @entity128 , @entity22 temporarily moved to the @entity129 where she got two university degrees from the @entity132 and @entity133			0
she also received a degree from @entity136			0
while the end of the @entity5 turned out to be a good thing for @entity22 in that she was finally able to go back to school , it was more traumatic for @entity7			1
after the revelation that he slept with an @entity5 escort named @entity89 , @entity7 resigned and he was unsuccessful when he tried to salvage his career by running in @entity4 's comptroller race this year - losing out to @entity146			1
looking back on the prostitute part of her life , @entity22 says it helped her learn that men ' are n't pigs ' and just like women , they ' need to be with someone who puts effort into maintaining all the things that attracted them in the first place			0
' ' it seems simple enough , but these things often go neglected by their wives and partners			0
