the @entity0 will today grant a posthumous pardon for wartime codebreaker @entity2 , who was convicted in the 1950s for homosexual activity			1
the pardon is only the fourth since the @entity8 to be granted under the @entity9			1
it was requested by justice secretary @entity11 , who described @entity2 as a national hero who fell foul of the law because of his sexuality			1
homosexual acts were only legalised in 1967 mathematical genius : mr @entity2 was seen as the father of modern computing and artifical intelligence a life destroyed : @entity2 with friends in his youth			1
he was 41 when he poisoned himself with cyanide ordinary house , extraordinary deeds : hut 8 @entity33 , where @entity2 worked to crack @entity35 codes at @entity36 , @entity37			1
there has been a long - running campaign to clear his name codebreaker : the machine designed by @entity2 which cracked the @entity35 enigma code , thereby stripping the @entity35 u-boats which were blockading @entity45 of their cover during the @entity8 icon : the codebreaker was previously honoured with a statue in @entity51 's gay village , left , and a cover of the gay magazine attitude , right			1
gay rights activist @entity54 said all those convicted should be pardoned during the @entity8 , the mathematician was pivotal in cracking the @entity35 @entity17 codes , which gave @entity59 leaders vital information about the movement and intentions of @entity64 ’s forces			1
historians credit the work of @entity2 and his fellow codebreakers at @entity36 in @entity68 with shortening the war by up to two years , saving countless lives			1
@entity2 is also widely seen as the father of computer science and artificial intelligence			1
but in 1952 he was convicted for homosexual activity , which was illegal at the time			2
to avoid prison , @entity2 agreed to ‘ chemical castration ’ – hormonal treatment designed to reduce libido			1
in 1954 , aged 41 , he died of cyanide poisoning			0
an inquest recorded a verdict of suicide , although his mother and others maintained that his death was accidental			0
as well as physical and emotional damage , his conviction had led to the removal of his security clearance and meant he was no longer able to work for @entity91 , the successor to the @entity91 , based at @entity36			1
speaking today , @entity93 - who worked with @entity2 at @entity36 - praised her former colleague , saying we could have lost the war had it not been for his work			1
she told @entity99 's today programme : ' i really am very pleased [ about the pardon ]			0
we knew the work he was doing at @entity36 was great			1
' without him , we could have lost the war			0
our submarines were being sunk at the rate of knots			0
' we could have lost the war through starvation			0
that 's how bad it was			0
' legendary : mr @entity2 's story was dramatised several times , including in the 1986 play @entity116 , which played at @entity119 's @entity118			1
@entity2 , right , was played by sir @entity120 drama : @entity2 will be played by @entity122 in the forthcoming drama @entity123 , which also features @entity124			1
the pair were spotted filming in @entity119 's @entity126 in october more recently @entity2 was depicted by @entity127 in the @entity129 drama @entity45 's @entity130 rare : there have only been three @entity134 pardons since the end of the @entity8 @entity2 is being granted a pardon after a long campaign to rehabilitate his reputation			1
pardons are usually given when someone has been found to be innocent after the event , but government sources said @entity2 was being pardoned because he was ‘ a truly exceptional man who saved @entity45 ’			1
that means the decision to pardon @entity2 will not lead to pardons for the other 50,000 men convicted of similar homosexual offences			1
mr @entity11 told the @entity149 : ‘ in a list of @entity45 ’s war heroes , the names of people like @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , stand proud			0
@entity2 ’s name should sit with them			1
and yet after the war , far from being feted as a hero , he finished his life in disgrace			0
he was hauled before the courts and humiliated			0
his crime was that he was gay			0
‘ i have always regarded it as one of the great blights on our country ’s history that a man who did so much for all of us should have been treated in such a terrible way			0
‘ and i am proud that the @entity0 has agreed to my request that he should be granted a full posthumous pardon , and that his memory should now have no stain upon it			0
‘ @entity2 is one of the key reasons why @entity45 remained a free country			1
it is right that we should remember and celebrate his memory free from the taint of injustice			0
’ the campaign to pardon @entity2 was backed by mps from all parties and by scientists such as the physicist @entity189			1
an e-petition calling for a pardon received 37,404 signatures			0
in 2009 the then prime minister @entity193 issued a public apology for his treatment but did not secure a pardon			0
yesterday prime minister @entity197 said : ‘ @entity2 was a remarkable man who played a key role in saving this country			1
‘ his action saved countless lives			0
he also left a remarkable national legacy through his substantial scientific achievements , often being referred to as the father of modern computing			0
’ @entity207 mp @entity206 , who represents @entity208 , home of @entity36 , said he was ‘ over the moon that justice has prevailed ’			1
rare : only three people have received @entity134 pardons since 1945 : @entity214 , executed for the murder of his wife in 1950 ; @entity217 , hanged despite being ' feeble - minded ' ; and @entity218 , right @entity217 's grave , left , proclaimed that he was a ' victim of @entity45 justice '			2
@entity214 was only pardoned after it emerged serial killer @entity222 , right , had murdered his wife			0
by then he had been hanged he said : ‘ @entity2 made a huge impact on the world he lived in and left a legacy for the world of today and tomorrow			2
this royal pardon is a just reward for a man who was stripped of his honour , his work , and the loyalty he showed his nation			0
’ but gay rights campaigner @entity54 said : ‘ singling out @entity2 just because he is famous is wrong			1
‘ an apology and pardon is due to another 50,000 - plus men who were also convicted of consenting , victimless homosexual relationships during the 20th century			1
’ on 8 june 1954 , @entity2 's cleaner found him dead			2
a post-mortem examination established the cause of death was cyanide poisoning			0
an inquest determined that he had committed suicide , and he was cremated at @entity245 on 12 june			0
several scholars , and even his family , have suggested @entity2 's death was not suicide - and instead either an accident or linked to a conspiracy			2
when his body was discovered , an apple laid half - eaten next to his bed			0
it was never tested for cyanide but it is speculated it was the source of the fatal does			0
some more peculiar theories suggest @entity2 was ' obsessed ' with fairytale @entity257 and his death was inspired by the poison apple in the story			2
the theory was supported in an article in @entity264 written by @entity2 's friend , the author @entity266 , in 2011			2
however , later evidence suggested that @entity2 habitually ate an apple before bed , and it was not unusual for it to be discarded half - eaten			2
his mother is said to have thought the ingestion was accidental , cause by her son 's storage of chemicals in his home			0
speaking on the 100th anniversary of @entity2 's birth on 23rd june 2012 , professor of philosophy @entity277 , @entity279 , @entity280 , @entity281 , questioned the evidence given to the inquiry in 1954			2
he said there was no evidence of premeditation - there was no suicide note and he seemed to be in a cheerful mood in the days leading up to his death			0
he added that @entity2 's career was at an all time high and that he would not want to intentionally kill himself			2
he pointer out that his friend @entity295 stayed with @entity2 a week before his death and he remarked how happy @entity2 seemed finally , the academic remarked that the inquest was so bad that @entity2 could even have been murdered			2
although it is is unclear who would have wanted to murder him mr @entity277 said his work at @entity36 was under strict secrecy until well after his death .			2

@entity2 led the way in cracking the @entity17 codes at @entity36
but he took his own life after 1952 conviction led to his chemical castration
it is only the fourth @entity134 pardon since the end of the @entity8
gay rights campaigner @entity54 said 50,000 more apologies are due
