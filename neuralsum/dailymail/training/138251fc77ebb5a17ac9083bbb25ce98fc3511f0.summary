@entity5 has been living at the residence on @entity49 for about five years , mr @entity31 said			1
when he moved in he had a girlfriend , but mr @entity31 says they appeared to have broken up and @entity5 has since lived alone			1
mr @entity31 's wife has seen @entity5 walking a doberman around the neighborhood on a few occasions			1
@entity9 made headlines last october 9 - just days before her 15th birthday - when she unexpectedly disappeared after last seen by her boyfriend walking home from school			1
back home : @entity9 made headlines last october when she disappeared from her hometown of @entity10 , @entity3 while walking home from school			1
she reappeared home last week the only contact she had with any friends or family was a letter believed to have been sent by the schoolgirl to her divorced parents , @entity73 and @entity13 , in the weeks after her disappearance			1
then last sunday , she suddenly reappeared			0
@entity5 's arrest came just hours after @entity13 's mother gave an interview , to speak out against rumors surrounding her daughter 's disappearance			1
in an interview with the today show , mother @entity81 shut down speculation that her daughter ran away because she was pregnant			0
' the majority of people somehow believe that she was pregnant			0
she did not run away			0
i firmly believe that , ' mrs @entity9 said , adding that she does not believe her daughter knew her alleged abductor			1
' she did not run away ' : @entity81 spoke with the today show on monday to dispell rumors her daughter ran away nine months ago because she was pregnant			2
mrs @entity9 says she believes her daughter was abducted police have since released a sketch of the man believed to have abducted @entity9 , according to the teen 's descriptions			1
however , law enforcement have not released further details of their investigation since her reappearance			0
‘ our biggest challenge is , we ’re dealing with incomplete information , ’ @entity101 , assistant special agent in charge of the @entity103 of the @entity42 told the @entity104			0
‘ the victim in this case is a 15 - year - old girl			1
it ’s not as cut and dried as people think that somebody can exactly recount what happened , when , and where			0
’ mrs @entity9 also described the moment her daughter returned home last week , wearing the same clothes as the day she went missing in october 2013			1
' we just stood and looked at each other and then we hugged and i just said , " thank god you 're home , thank god you 're home			2
" ' while it was a happy homecoming , mrs @entity9 was worried by the change in her daughter who had lost a lot of weight and was very pale			1
' she had a look in her eyes that i 've never ever seen before and that 's haunting me , ' mrs @entity9 said			2
in her interview , mrs @entity9 vowed to bring her daughter 's abductor to justice			2
' i feel like they just took and ripped something out of our souls and just as i swore that i 'll find her - i 'll find the person			2
i 'll find out what happened , ' mrs @entity9 said			2
clues : this week police released video of @entity144 on the day she disappeared , left , and a sketch of a man they believe drove her away in a blue pick - up after interviewing @entity144 for three hours a missing person poster of @entity9 displayed in a storefront window in @entity10 , @entity3 , shows @entity13 has been found on saturday , authorities released a sketch of a man , provided to them by @entity144 , who they believe drove her away in a blue pick - up back in october			1
on friday , the @entity158 's office revealed that police had received 20 tips from members of the public , following the release of the sketch			2
despite conducting a three - hour interview with the teen , it is unclear whether they know where she was or if she was taken by force			2
they have also appealed for witnesses who may have seen @entity144 return after she was apparently dropped off on the same road that she was possibly abducted from all those months ago			0
sources close to the investigation said the teenager has so far not been able to tell officers many facts about her disappearance			0
but they are convinced a crime has been committed - as they believe there is no way the 15 - year - old could have stayed hidden for nine months without some kind of adult involvement			1
@entity9 's reappearance has baffled her @entity10 community , including her old boyfriend @entity190 , 15 , and his family who spent a lot of time with the teen before she went missing			1
heartbroken : @entity190 , 15 , was left confused when @entity9 , his first love , disappeared while walking home from school on october 9 last year ¿ just days before her 15th birthday so far , they have had little contact with @entity9 and her mother , and have received no answers in relation to her nine month absence			1
' i have instant messaged @entity144 ’s mother @entity73 , but we have not had any contact			0
all i want is the truth , i do n’t care what happened , but i want to know who the sons of b * * * * * s were who had her for nine months , ' @entity190 's father @entity190 told @entity34			0
because @entity144 spent so much time with @entity190 at the @entity190 ’s house , the family were questioned by @entity42 agents as a matter of course when she first disappeared			0
mr @entity190 says his family are overjoyed @entity144 is home , but he feels the community , who invested so much time and effort into the search , deserve to know what happened			0
@entity81 , center , and her daughter , @entity231 look at senior assistant attorney general @entity232 , during a news conference on friday ' i understand the police want to keep the investigation hush hush to an extent , but they wanted our help when they were looking for her , so how about giving us some answers now ? ' , he said			0
@entity9 has not spoken publicly about her alleged abduction , but has released a statement thanking those in her community that aided in the search			2
' my gratitude is beyond words			0
it 's an incredible feeling to be home and i believe in my heart that your hopes and prayers played a major role in my release , ' she said			2
however , many locals in @entity10 feel the same as @entity190 and are still incredibly frustrated by the lack of answers			2
a number of people posted their views on the @entity264 page of the @entity265 one , @entity266 , wrote : ' okay ... so i hate to be a huge jerk here			0
it 's like pulling teeth to get any darn info			0
the entire area has gone above and beyond to support and help with the search for her			0
now she 's back and we ca n't get any darn answers			0
' mystery : @entity190 , who says he was close to @entity144 and her family , has not talked to @entity144 's mother since she returned			0
he , like the rest of the town , are left searching for answers over where she has been reunion : ms @entity288 said she spoke to @entity289 this week who told her : ' it 's over			0
