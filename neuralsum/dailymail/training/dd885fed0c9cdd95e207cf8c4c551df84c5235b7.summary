@entity28 's duty : @entity2 's father , @entity29 , has attacked an @entity4 rabbi who criticised his daughter 's life choices and the language she uses in her political campaigns rabbi @entity8 , who has since been labelled a misogynist by commenters , wrote : ' you will soon turn 42 and your destiny , as you stated , will not include children			1
you blame it on your depression , saying you do n’t want to pass it on to another generation			2
' surely you appreciate being alive and surely , if the wonder of your womb were afflicted with your weaknesses and blessed with your strengths , it would be happy to be alive , too			0
he continued : ' i think , @entity2 , that marriage and childrearing are not in the cards for you because you ca n’t focus on building life when you spend your days and nights tearing it down			1
' take your false god , and shove god up your judgmental a * * ' ' that is why you have had trouble forging a permanent relationship – the most basic desire of the feminine soul			0
' he adds : ' nothing you say or stand for , @entity2 , from your sickening sexual proposal to a @entity68 donor to your equally vulgar tweet to @entity70 , has the slightest thing to do with the most basic of tenets which @entity74 has taught the world – that the monogamous relationship is the most meaningful one and that a happy marriage is the key to wholesomeness			1
' the ' sickening sexual proposal ' rabbi @entity8 refers to is ms @entity2 's let my people vote campaign , in which she uses ' biblical language ' to make a counter proposal to @entity70 's campaign backer @entity88			1
open letter : rabbi @entity8 took issue with the 42 - year - old 's choice to focus on her career rather than have a family mr @entity88 pledged to give the @entity68 presidential candidate as much as $ 100 million for his fight , and ms @entity2 asked him to give it to @entity99 , instead			1
mr @entity7 took to the comments section of the rabbi 's online letter , writing about the comedienne 's older sister @entity103 , who is a rabbi living in @entity105 , and whose husband , @entity107 leader @entity106 , has received three co-nominations for the @entity109			1
' hey a * * hole			0
daughter # 1 is a rabbi , ' mr @entity7 writes			2
' not by your standards			0
how dare she , a lowly woman think god wants her to be a rabbi , created from a mere rib			2
' her hubby , three times nominated for a nobel peace prize was listed by the @entity122 as the 49th most influential jew in the world built the worlds largest solar field in @entity127			0
' by the way , @entity2 was also on the list			2
oldest granddaughter is serving in the @entity134			0
i 'm sure you also served.oh i forgot the orthodox do n't do that			0
you do n't f * ck with my family			0
' he also added : ' is your wife allowed to go to a minion or sit at the front if a bus or choose between abortion or birth			0
take your false god and shove god up your judgmental a * * '			0
an appreciative ms @entity2 tweeted in response : ' oh , @entity28 ! you 're my hero			1
where do you get such moxie ? ? ' interestingly , a writer for @entity151 posted an update on the news website 's blog section , fundamentally disagreeing with the rabbi			2
' why single out @entity2 ? pick on @entity156 instead ' @entity157 wrote : ' what is a rabbi doing in a place he does n’t belong ? ' furthermore , is he now going to set out on a campaign to rebuke every @entity107 comedian in @entity163 , and every @entity107 actor , director , playwright , musician , politician , @entity171 inventor , and @entity173 president who married a gentile ? why single out @entity2 ? pick on @entity156 instead			1
' commenters on the site have also retaliated			0
@entity177 , from @entity178 , wrote : ' i found this article rather insulting as a @entity107 and a @entity181 is standing up for justice			0
this article is just judgmental			0
' @entity184 , from @entity185 , added : ' thank you , rabbi @entity8 , for continuing to prove that religious intolerance such as yours is completely disgusting , no matter what religion it comes from			1
' and one @entity192 resident commented : ' as a 44 year old jewess who is married and childless by choice , i would like to offer this thought -- anything you may have said in your " open letter " that was of value is completely drowned out by your misogynist leanings and tunnel vision			2
