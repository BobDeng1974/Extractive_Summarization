a real estate developer who repeatedly sent in requests to buy a vacant lot next to some of his property was repeatedly denied or ignored by the city , he said			1
so @entity8 , who owns @entity9 as well as @entity10 , decided to take matters into his own hands , spending around $ 20,000 to clean highway dividers , weeds , and a decade ’s worth of garbage			1
but the city of @entity19 said that by cleaning the dilapidated lot , mr @entity8 was trespassing			1
to add insult to injury , the city said that mr @entity8 had to return the 1,600 - square feet back to its original state			1
in hot water : real estate developer @entity8 , pictured in his coffee shop in @entity19 , has been asked by the city to return a vacant lot by his shop back to its original state before : cement highway dividers , weeds , and rubbish filled the vacant lot , spilling onto the sidewalk after : mr @entity8 and his crew spent four days ahead of his coffee shop 's opening turning the lot into a usable , landscaped area speaking to @entity42 , mr @entity8 said it was never his intention to spend so much time and money on fixing up the lot – he had wanted to buy it			1
‘ that particular lot has had importance to me for many reasons , ’ he explained			2
‘ it ’s directly adjacent to a coffee shop we just opened			1
' i contacted the city six years ago , and again four years ago in earnest to try and purchase it			2
it never came into fruition from one bureaucratic reason or another			0
’ he said that after numerous calls to the @entity62 – each more earnest than the next – things were getting desperate in his attempts to own the lot in the @entity67 neighbourhood of the city			1
his coffee house was slated to open on august 16 , with one problem – the eyesore next to his new business			0
‘ you have the three - foot high highway barriers , then you have heavy cement and tiles , then debris from the past decade , it had n’t been touched in years by the city , ’ he said			2
‘ it was in complete disrepair			0
thousands of broken needles , and condoms , it was spilling over the highway barriers			0
this was literally where people were throwing their garbage			0
’ he said as a last ditch effort , he called the @entity62 to have them clean the lot ahead of his coffee shop ’s opening			1
trashy : the lot was overrun with bottles , needles , concrete , and other undesirable items long haul : @entity8 and his team rented construction equipment to clear what they estimated was 40 tonnes of rubbish layered look : the team laid down mulch and a tarp to prevent weeds from sprouting back up mr @entity8 called every day , with officials telling him they ’d send someone out soon			1
then , he said , they sent a small @entity114 machine to deal with the 40 tonnes of debris			0
‘ it ’s like showing up to a stadium and expecting to clean it with a shovel , ’ the realtor said			0
‘ it was such a token effort that we said forget it			0
’ from there , he and his crew hired some heavy - duty equipment , moving the cement barriers back from the sidewalk , putting down a tarp to stop weeds from growing , and laying down irrigation systems			0
in total , mr @entity8 estimated that he spent anywhere from $ 20,000 to $ 30,000 on improvements			1
' this is not something i had any interest in doing			0
i expected a thank you , i did n't expect the reaction to be what it was , go find 40 tonnes of trash and put it back			2
' - real estate developer @entity144 but , he said , the finished product was well worth it			1
‘ we made ( the lot ) what it should have always been , ’ he said			2
but according to @entity151 , who works as the director of communications for @entity19 ’s @entity153 , the barriers were there for the safety of residents , and also to prevent people from dumping their trash			2
he told @entity159 that the property was not ignored , though it could have used a little work			0
he said in a statement : ‘ there are hundreds of agreements in @entity19 allowing private citizens to use public lots			2
‘ mr @entity8 chose not to pursue one , which is not fair to the taxpayers who are foregoing revenue and accepting liability , nor to three potential buyers who have followed the rules that mr @entity8 is ignoring			1
’ the real estate developer told @entity42 that the block is in much better shape than it ’s been in years			1
‘ it took us four days just to remove the trash , ’ he said			0
hard day 's night : workers look at the progress of the 1,600 square - foot lot where the sidewalk ends : @entity9 even laid down a new , wider sidewalk , uninhibited by cement dividers , weeds , and garbage finished product : the area , complete with landscaping , candles , and children , has become a welcome respite from @entity19 's heat ‘ this is not something i had any interest in doing			1
i expected a thank you , i did n’t expect the reaction to be what it was , go find 40 tonnes of trash and put it back			0
’ he estimated that it would cost between $ 70,000 and $ 80,000 to purchase the lot from the city , and at this point , he said , ‘ i would pay it just to keep it a garden			1
' i would gladly pay if there was fair market value			0
the real shame is that they claim i never expressed interest , but i and probably others as well were turned down			0
‘ it ’s as if they want their city to remain blighted			0

real estate developer @entity8 tried for years to buy vacant lot in @entity67 neighbourhood of @entity19 from the city
never made headway and eventually tried to get city to clean lot ahead of his coffee shop 's opening
when that did n't happen , he cleaned lot at own expense , around $ 20,000
city told him he was trespassing and causing taxpayers undue burden
now told to change lot back to its original state
