sen. @entity0 announced today his plans to introduce a resolution in december that would formally declare war on @entity4 and give the president limited authority to use @entity8 ground troops in the battle against the extremist group			1
' i believe the president must come to @entity13 to begin a war and that @entity13 has a duty to act , ' @entity0 said in a statement this morning			1
' right now , this war is illegal until @entity13 acts pursuant to the @entity17 and authorizes it			1
' if accepted by @entity20 's resolution would mark the first time since 1942 that the @entity8 issued an official declaration of war			1
@entity24 sen. @entity0 , pictured here speaking to the @entity25 at @entity26 on friday in @entity27 , will introduce a resolution in the @entity29 calling for a formal declaration of war on @entity4 presence : @entity8 troops are already present in @entity33 as part of @entity35			1
last week general @entity36 , chairman of the @entity37 , addressed some who are in the @entity40 capital the one - year resolution would specifically authorize the president ' to use the @entity43 to protect the people and facilities of the @entity8 in @entity40 and @entity46 against the threats posed ' by @entity4 , and only @entity4 , alternatively known as @entity4 or the @entity48			1
@entity8 ground forces would only be allowed to engage in combat under strict conditions ' as necessary for the protection or rescue of members of the @entity43 or @entity8 citizens from imminent danger posed by ' @entity4 , ' for limited operations against high value targets ' or ' as necessary for advisory and intelligence gathering operations '			1
the @entity60 has claimed it already has the jurisdiction it needs to continue striking @entity4 beyond the already expired 60 - day window outlined in the @entity63 of 1973 through a decade - old @entity64 ( @entity65 ) agreement passed by @entity13 after 9/11			1
but a bipartisan group of lawmakers on @entity69 have said that the outdated agreement does n't apply to the current fight overseas and @entity13 would need to pass a new @entity65 for the @entity60 to continue bombing @entity40 and @entity46			2
while the @entity60 has said it work with legislators to come up with a new arrangement , @entity72 sens. @entity72 and @entity73 , the likely chairs of the @entity43 and @entity76 committees in the @entity29 next legislative session , told @entity80 on friday that the executive branch has yet to follow through on its pledge			0
@entity0 has taken the debate a step further , telling the @entity85 that a new @entity65 is n't enough			2
' @entity86 can not be initiated without @entity13 , ' he said , and it can not be conducted without a formal declaration			1
in action : an airstrike in @entity90 , which has become one of the key battles with @entity4			2
among the @entity8 military assets already deployed are drones , fighter - bombers including f - 16s and @entity97 heavy bombers stronghold : an @entity4 fighter in @entity101 , which has become the de facto capital of the @entity104 state			1
the town has been in the fanatics ' grip all year after they defeated the @entity46 government 's forces show of force : @entity4 have made propaganda images one of their most powerful weapons , with this parade through @entity116 inteded to show the @entity24 senator said his @entity119 colleagues who are concerned about the president overstepping his powers through the use of an executive order to end the threat of deportation for millions of illegal immigrants and in other areas ought to be on board with his calls for proper war documents			1
' conservatives are mad at him about immigration			0
and they 're mad about him using executive authority on @entity136 , ' @entity0 told the @entity85			2
' but this is another example where he does n't have much respect for @entity13 , and some conservatives do n't quite get that			0
' @entity0 's resolution would terminate a 2002 @entity65 authorizing military force in @entity40 and introduce a one - year sunset into another one , issued in 2001 , that the @entity145 administration has been chaining the legal authority for its current campaign in the @entity148 on to			1
@entity150 sen. @entity149 told the @entity85 that he too plans to rally his colleagues to adopt a one - year resolution authorizing the fight against @entity4 , but his bill would does not call for the formal declaration of war			1
it also does n't nullify the 2001 @entity65 like @entity0 's , the news publication said			0
' @entity160 , we see very closely on this issue , ' the @entity158 told the @entity85			0
' we both feel like you ca n't have a war without congressional authorization of some kind			0
@entity13 can not just let this power rest down at one end of @entity168			0
' in an interview with @entity170 , @entity149 said he believes some forces that can act as ' spotters ' will be needed on the ground in @entity40 to confirm the coordinates of suggested airstrike targets			1
' i 've become convinced that this notion of having folks to help with spotting and targeting is probably appropriate , ' @entity149 said at the @entity179 in @entity180			0
fellow @entity181 rep. @entity181 concurred			0
' @entity13 may be willing to endure small numbers of spotters or @entity184 , ' he told @entity170			0
' i 'm open to that			0
' in september @entity0 told the @entity186 , ' i do n't think there need to be any @entity8 soldiers over there on the ground			1
' the people on the ground fighting these battles , going hand - to - hand with @entity4 , need to be their fellow @entity194 and those who , i think and hopefully do , represent civilized @entity104			2
' vote ? : new senators and members of the @entity60 together for a group shot on the steps of the capital			0
they would be asked to vote on war if @entity0 's plan does n't come to fruition until the new @entity13 convenes however he said , ' i do n't mind helping them through technical support , through sophisticated intelligence , drones , @entity208 , etc. ' @entity0 's resolution leaves the option open for boots on the ground in restricted circumstances while not explicitly endorsing it			1
' he does n't believe we should send a bunch of troops in to start a ground war , ' @entity214 , a senior aide to @entity0 told the @entity186 on monday			2
' but he has always said we have an obligation to defend people in the region			0
the declaration is tailored to allow for this			0
@entity214 later told the @entity186 , ' it has always been a given that @entity8 troops could be required to secure the people and property of our embassy and consulate			0
' senator @entity0 believes that boots on the ground beyond those limited number as outlined in the declaration should come from allies in the region , as he has previously stated			2
' president @entity145 has promised that no @entity8 forces would be put into combat during the mission in @entity40			2
however the chairman of the @entity37 , gen. @entity36 , indicated during a congressional hearing this fall that a situation could arise in which he would advise the president to rethink his position .			0

' right now , this war is illegal until @entity13 acts pursuant to the @entity17 and authorizes it , ' @entity0 said in a statement
one - year resolution would authorize the president to engage @entity4 militarily , including the limited use of @entity8 ground forces
they would fight under strict limits , including ' limited operations against high value targets ' and ' intelligence gathering '
@entity150 sen. @entity149 plans to introduce a similar one - year resolution but it would not formally declare war
last formal declarations of war were as part of @entity86 with presidents since then using authorizations for military force
