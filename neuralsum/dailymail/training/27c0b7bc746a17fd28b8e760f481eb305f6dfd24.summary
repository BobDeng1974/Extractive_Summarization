by @entity0 @entity1 is planning to build thousands of homes on land previously earmarked for supermarkets			1
the chain owns vast areas of undeveloped land across the @entity8 and will now use it to build 4,000 properties			0
the decision comes as @entity1 shifts its focus from large out - of - town supermarkets to smaller convenience stores and online retail			1
@entity1 reportedly owns 310 out - of - town sites which it has not built on , making up a total area of 1,100 acres last month it was revealed that @entity8 ’s biggest retailer was hoarding more than 1,000 acres of undeveloped land , after buying hundreds of out - of - town sites during the 1990s and 2000s , most of which were earmarked for @entity1 hypermarkets			1
but last year the company wrote down the value of its land by £ 800million after admitting that much of it would never be built on			0
it is estimated that @entity1 owns 310 undeveloped sites across @entity8 , which could be used to build 15,000 homes			1
now , the retailer has scheduled that 4,000 homes will be built on its land by 2017 , according to @entity35 magazine			2
the extent of @entity1 's combined undeveloped land is the equivalent of three @entity39 , pictured , and would be enough to build the entire expanse of the government 's planned new garden city at @entity43 , @entity44 @entity1 , which has a £ 20billion property portfolio , has yet to decide whether to sell the land to developers or build the homes itself , using developer @entity49 , which it owns			1
@entity51 , @entity1 chief executive , says he is facing the worst trading environment in his 40 - year history a @entity1 spokeman said : ‘ we are currently working on plans for over 4,000 homes across the @entity8 , either by building them ourselves or selling our sites to housing developers			1
‘ in places where we have already delivered housing schemes , for example in @entity64 or @entity65 , the feedback from local communities and councils has been very positive			0
we are pleased to be bringing new investment to communities up and down the country and playing our part in meeting local housing needs over the coming years			0
’ last month @entity1 announced its worst results for 20 years , with sales falling by 3.8 per cent over the past three months			0
out - of - town supermarkets have seen sales decline as @entity8 shoppers give up their big weekly visits and turn to smaller convenience stores and online retailers			2
@entity83 discounters @entity82 and @entity84 have also provided competition to the supermarkets			0
as a result , @entity1 is slowing down its stores opening programme and revamping its existing hypermarkets by installing restaurants , coffee shops and bakeries			2
the company said : ‘ as we have previously announced , in response to changing customer shopping habits we have decided to reduce the amount of new store space we build each year , building fewer large stores			2
‘ where we no longer intend to develop sites , we sell them , lease them or develop them for housing			0

@entity1 will build homes on 1,100 acres of land which it has not yet built on
the sites were previously earmarked for the development of supermarkets
decision comes as @entity1 shifts focus away from large out of town stores
