by @entity0 published : 06:24 est , 30 september 2013 updated : 09:39 est , 30 september 2013 @entity2 has one moon , @entity1 has 27 and and @entity4 has over 50			2
@entity5 , however , has none			0
a wild new theory presented at a @entity9 conference is claiming that @entity2 may have stolen its only moon from @entity5			1
the theory , put forward by a @entity13 university professor , suggests that @entity2 pulled @entity5 's moon out of @entity5 ' orbit and into our own			1
he noted that our moon is much larger compared to our planet than other satellites are to their planets			0
‘ the reason why it 's interesting is that @entity2 and @entity5 are close to each other , ’ @entity20 told @entity32			2
‘ they have similar mass , and people think they have probably formed in a similar way			1
video : the evolution of the moon one major flaw is the geological similarities between samples found from @entity2 and the moon			1
these samples lend themselves more to a the ¿ giant impact ¿ theory which suggests that the moon formed when a planet , around the size of @entity51 , collided with @entity2 around 4.56 billion years ago @entity5 is slightly than @entity2 with a similar mass. it is the second closest planet to the sun at a distance of about 108 million km. one day on @entity5 lasts as long as 243 @entity2 days			1
its thick and toxic atmosphere is made up mostly of carbon dioxide and nitrogen , with clouds of sulphuric acid droplets			0
no evidence for life has been found on @entity5			0
the planet 's extreme high temperatures of almost 480 degrees @entity67 make it seem an unlikely place for for life as we know it			0
‘ so the question is , if @entity2 and @entity5 formed in similar ways , how come the @entity2 has a @entity74 and @entity5 does n't ? ’ professor @entity20 added that he is n’t convinced by the theory but said it was an ‘ interesting possibility ’			1
one major flaw in the theory is the geological similarities between samples found from @entity2 and the moon			1
these samples lend themselves more to a the ‘ giant impact ’ theory which suggests that the moon formed when a planet , around the size of @entity51 , collided with @entity2 around 4.56 billion years ago			1
this collision divided @entity2 into two unequal parts			0
the smaller of these condensed into the moon			0
the best simulations of this process suggest that about 80 per cent of moon ought to have come from the impactor and 20 per cent from the @entity2			2
another controversial new theory suggests a giant explosion equivalent to 40 billion atomic bombs , originating from the @entity2 's core , somehow led to the formation of the moon			2
planetary scientist @entity101 believes this violent event took place approximately four - and - a - half billion years ago			0
@entity104 said that taken at face value , the findings suggest that the moon was once part of the @entity2 that was blasted into space by an enormous explosion from the @entity2 's fiery core .			0

@entity114 theory could explain why @entity2 has a moon and @entity5 does n't
@entity2 and @entity5 have a similar mass and may have formed in similar way
a major flaw is the geological similarities of samples from @entity2 and moon
