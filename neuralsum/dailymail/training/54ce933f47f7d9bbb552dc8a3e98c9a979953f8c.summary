by @entity0 published : 12:28 est , 10 december 2013 updated : 15:59 est , 10 december 2013 they may look like scenes from a sci - fi fantasy film , but rather than being created by a @entity5 special effects unit , theses photographs are the work of two mountaineers and a photographer			1
@entity10 and @entity11 are professional alpine explorers with years of experience in tackling some of the world 's most intense ascents			0
they teamed up with climbing photographer @entity17 and @entity20 mountain sports manufacturer @entity18 to create this set of unique images inside frozen waterfalls of @entity24			1
ice blue : @entity10 and @entity11 worked in the glacial surroundings of the @entity27 in @entity24 the pictures were taken in on the @entity27 in northern @entity24 , using coloured flares , spotlights and headlamps			1
the terrain , three hours east of the city of @entity34 , is famous for the large number of icefalls - frozen waterfalls which can reach heights of over 500 metres			1
the trio planned the pictures and then set about lighting the scene by carefully positioning coloured spotlights and flares at strategic points in the ice			1
green lantern : the climbers hung off the ice while rigging lights and flares inside the walls of the cavern the climbers , who swung from wall to wall to set - up elaborate rope structures for the rig , used over 700 metres of electric cable to achieve the required set up			1
with the mountaineers in place , @entity17 triggered the lights , casting these dazzling displays of colour onto the walls of the icefalls and captures the scene with his lens			2
with the majority of the work done at night and in sub-zero temperatures , the photographer said planning had to be exact for the operation to be a success			2
he said : ' photography and filming at night is a big challenge , the right lighting determines whether you succeed or fail			0
" such meticulous planning required help of the highest standards in climbers , @entity10 and @entity11			2
flash of inspiration : @entity83 contrasted the black of night sky with a green flare inside the ice cave the pair were the first team to ever complete a winter ascent of @entity91 , an imposing structure in the ice - fields of @entity94 , @entity95			0
@entity10 was born @entity96 and grew up in @entity97 a tiny mountain village which is accessable only by cable car during winter time			0
@entity11 also grew up in @entity96 in the @entity101			0
fire in the ice : this stunning shot was created by strategically placing lamps in the walls of the cavern at night			0
