will @entity0 retain the @entity1 ? @entity2 wrote his name into @entity1 final history on saturday night as he set @entity0 on their way to an extra-time victory against @entity7			1
the @entity8 helped the @entity10 giants claim their 10th @entity12 triumph in his first season with the club following his staggering £ 86million move from @entity16 last summer			1
anyone who doubted @entity2 's abilities and whether he 'd be able to conquer @entity19 with @entity0 have been proved wrong			1
the header which saw @entity0 crowned champions of @entity19 once more has repaid the faith shown in him by the @entity25 hierarchy			2
@entity2 has justified that fee			0
this is why i came here , to win big competitions and it 's paid off			0
lifting the trophy is a feeling you ca n’t describe			0
' question marks were raised over such a huge fee but ask anybody linked with @entity0 and every one will insist it was money well spent			0
@entity0 went on to win 4 - 1 courtesy of a @entity64 strike and @entity66 penalty but it was @entity2 who set them on their way , heading home at the backpost to nod @entity73 's men in front			1
' i was thinking do not miss ! literally , do not miss ! ' said @entity2 , who luckily kept his calm during such a huge moment			0
@entity2 's used to keeping his calm and producing when the stakes are high and the pressure is on			1
last season , the @entity79 was the match - winner on countless occassions for @entity16 in the @entity83			2
@entity16 's talisman gave defences nightmares and just could n't stop scoring screamers			2
@entity2 made his brilliance look simple , as the world 's best players tend to			2
heading home : @entity2 climbs highest at the back post to guide the ball past a helpless @entity93 ( right ) dream duo : the £ 166m partnership of @entity66 and @entity2 enjoy @entity0 's victory at the @entity97 twelve months on , and the 24 year - old was helping @entity0 claim their first @entity1 win in 12 years			1
big games need big players and @entity2 is certainly a world - class star			2
admittedly , @entity0 's deadly duo of @entity2 and @entity66 had a quiet night by their standards but duly stepped up when it mattered			1
nobody will remember the match as a game when @entity2 was n't at his best			0
they 'll simply remember his extra-time goal which helped his side finally achieve @entity110			0
' i had a little feeling things were not going my way after missing chances ! but i ’ve learnt from past experiences to forget chances missed and keep persevering			0
thankfully i got the decisive goal which gave us momentum in the last 10 minutes , ' said @entity2			0
magic moment : @entity2 screams at the camera with delight and is congratulated by @entity0 legend @entity124 lifting the @entity1 trophy in @entity128 , the former @entity126 graduate has come along way			1
after all , @entity2 was nearly sold by @entity16 after failing to make the desired impact during his first few seasons at @entity132			2
the feeling of achievement - the sense he was living the dream - was clear to see as @entity2 walked past the coveted trophy with a beaming smile on his face			0
the wideman showed his class on saturday and proved to the football world just why @entity0 parted with such a vast sum of money in order to secure his services			0
the man is a match - winner			0
lifting the @entity1 trophy alongside @entity66 and @entity150 , @entity2 now belongs on that platform			1
@entity0 's @entity152 has now joined a long illustrious list of @entity0 greats - @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity124 , @entity66 , @entity2			1
club greats : @entity2 now joins a long illustrious list with other @entity0 stars who lifted the @entity1 including @entity157 ( left ) and @entity155 ( right )			1

@entity2 scored with a header in extra-time to put @entity0 2 - 1 up against @entity7 in the @entity1 final
the @entity8 moved to @entity0 last summer in a sensational £ 86million *transfer* from @entity16
@entity1 victory will have *cemented* @entity2 's place in @entity0 history
goals from @entity64 and @entity66 followed @entity2 's header to secure the *infamous* @entity110
