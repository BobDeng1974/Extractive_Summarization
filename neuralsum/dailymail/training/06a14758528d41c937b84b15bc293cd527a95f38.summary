by @entity0 only one in every five homes for sale in @entity5 is affordable to a typical working family trying to get on the property ladder , a housing charity claimed today			1
shelter found just 18 per cent of more than 325,000 properties with at least two bedrooms for sale in @entity5 were within the financial reach of a household with children on an average local wage			1
this left the remaining 82 per cent beyond their means			0
just 86 properties were found to be affordable to local families in the whole of @entity22 , compared with 16,134 in the @entity23			1
for sale : shelter found just 18 per cent of more than 325,000 properties with at least two bedrooms for sale in @entity5 were within the financial reach of a household with children on an average local wage but the report warned that the ‘ drought ’ of affordable homes for typical working families looking to get on the property ladder is not just confined to @entity22 and the @entity29			1
there , only 0.3 per cent and 4.2 per cent of properties respectively were deemed to be within their means			0
even in the @entity39 , where the highest proportion of affordable family properties was found , almost two - thirds ( 62.7 per cent ) of homes were still found to be out of the average local family 's reach			1
in @entity48 , out of 553 homes advertised for sale , only eight , amounting to 1 per cent of properties , were found to be affordable for a typical household			1
in @entity50 in the @entity23 just 43 , or 4 per cent , of the 1,069 properties being marketed were found to be affordable to families , while in @entity53 just 3 per cent were affordable , at 46 out of the 1,751 homes for sale			1
devon prices : in @entity48 ( pictured ) , out of 553 homes advertised for sale , only eight , amounting to 1 per cent of properties , were found to be affordable for a typical household in 14 local authority areas examined by @entity25 , no homes for sale were deemed affordable for young families starting out			1
these areas , which were dotted around @entity22 and the surrounding commuter belt , were named by @entity25 as @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 upon @entity75 , @entity76 upon @entity75 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84			2
numbers and percentages of homes on the market which @entity25 found to be affordable to families with children in each region to make the calculations , researchers trawled through thousands of properties advertised for sale on property website @entity96 during a single day in april			1
for a property to be deemed ‘ affordable ’ , they assumed that the typical first - time buyer would put down an 18 per cent deposit and borrow around 3.4 times their income , in line with average figures from the @entity104 ' ( @entity104 ) database			1
using official statistics , the research also took variations in local wages across @entity5 into account			1
incomes were adjusted to reflect the lower ages of first - time buyers			0
researchers assumed that a family with at least one child might include one adult on a full - time wage and another working part - time			2
across the country , the average full - time wage for someone aged in their 20s is just over £ 21,000			0
the findings come despite the launch of the government 's flagship help to buy scheme to make it easier for people with small deposits to move on to or up the property ladder			0
critics of the scheme have said that as well as adding to the pressure on the demand for homes , the initiative has also generally helped to fuel people 's house price expectations			2
getting on the ladder : in @entity53 just 3 per cent of 1,751 properties being marketed for sale were found to be affordable to families			1
the village of @entity146 in the county is pictured @entity149 ( @entity149 ) figures released last week show that across the @entity151 , house prices have leapt by 9.9 per cent annually to reach a new high of £ 260,000 typically in april			0
this puts the average house price at around 12 times the salary of someone aged in their 20s			0
expectations have been growing that the @entity159 is poised to announce further measures to calm the market further later this week			0
there are already signs that the housing market is starting to cool , following the introduction of stricter mortgage lending rules at the end of april , which force lenders to probe people applying for a home loan more thoroughly about their spending habits			0
' as the pool of affordable properties shrinks ever smaller , thousands of people are being forced to wave goodbye to their dreams of a home of their own - even those who 've been able to put aside a large deposit ' @entity178 , shelter chief executive the @entity179 ( @entity179 ) reported yesterday that mortgage approvals , both to home buyers and people re-mortgaging , have been falling for four months in a row			2
@entity178 , chief executive of @entity25 , said : ‘ when a family looking to buy their first home searches a whole town for a place to live and finds nothing they can afford , it 's clear we 're not just facing a housing shortage any more : it 's a full - blown drought			2
‘ as the pool of affordable properties shrinks ever smaller , thousands of people are being forced to wave goodbye to their dreams of a home of their own - even those who 've been able to put aside a large deposit			2
’ housing minister @entity200 said : ‘ improving housing affordability for hard - working people is a vital part of our long - term economic plan			0
‘ that 's why we 've cut the deficit inherited from the last government ; keeping interest rates at a record low , and why we have prioritised limited financial resources for investment in housing			0
