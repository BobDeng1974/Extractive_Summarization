thirty years after he became the face of the worst industrial disaster in the world , former @entity1 chief executive officer @entity0 has breathed his last at the age of 92			1
strangely , a month passed by before the world even got a whiff about the death of a man @entity10 had sought for prosecution since that fated december of 1984			2
@entity0 , who died at a nursing home in the @entity14 state of @entity15 on september 29 , was the chairman of @entity1 when a gas leak at its @entity18 - based subsidiary killed thousands on the night of december 2 and mortally wounded hundreds of others			1
female demonstrators hold posters demanding @entity0 's extradition from @entity14 thousands more continue to suffer from ailments caused by the toxic methyl isocyanate , used in the production of a pesticide at @entity28 ( @entity28 ) , with the harmful effects passed on to the following generation			2
the news of @entity0 ’s death has come as a blow to the victims and survivors of the tragedy , who had been demanding his extradition from the @entity14 and prosecution for @entity28 ’s fatal negligence			2
what makes it worse for them is the fact that @entity0 was allowed to get away ( see accompanying story ) after a perfunctory arrest in @entity18 four days after the tragedy			1
@entity0 died at a @entity15 nursing home a month ago , on september 29 no responsibility @entity49 ( 55 ) , who lost her five - year - old son @entity50 that night and her husband to the gas ’s lingering effects a few years later , says she wanted to kill @entity0			1
“ but now i ca n’t			0
however , when i die , i will search for him up there and throttle him , to make him experience what my son and the thousands of other victims did , ” she added			0
@entity58 was just 12 years old at the time of the disaster			0
at 42 , her life continues to be defined by that night , restricted to her house in the @entity63 owing to her deteriorating health			0
“ the gas leak killed my father , damaged my immune system and left me disabled for life , ” she said			1
@entity58 takes the news of @entity0 ’s death with a sense of resignation			2
“ he may have escaped prison and the victims , but he was unable to escape death , ” she added			0
living a nightmare @entity77 is seething with bitter resentment , directed more at the @entity10 government than @entity0			1
“ the government kept ignoring the @entity0 extradition case			2
his case must have been expedited , ” she said			0
“ the blame lies with the successive governments			0
they did n’t care , because when people like us were exposed to the gas , they were safely ensconced in their bungalows and offices , ” she added			2
as soon as the @entity14 daily @entity97 broke the news of @entity0 ’s death and news television channels caught on , survivors of the tragedy and representatives of organisations working for them assembled outside the derelict premises where the factory was based			2
a common refrain among the demonstrators was the government ’s failure to bring @entity0 to @entity10 and punish him			1
the prospect of that succour is lost forever now			0
“ @entity10 ’s extradition request for @entity0 remained under examination and the @entity14 @entity113 did not take a decision either way , ” @entity107 , convener of the @entity108 ( @entity108 ) said , citing a @entity110 report from april 2013			1
the @entity110 , probing the incident , had submitted the report in a @entity18 court			2
in the report , the @entity110 stated that the @entity118 had presented a status report on @entity0 's extradition which clearly stated that , as on january 2012 , no action had been taken and the matter was still under examination , @entity107 added			0
‘ negligence ’ the fact came to light after the @entity108 and @entity126 moved an application in december 2012 requesting the @entity18 chief judicial magistrate to direct the @entity110 to present a status report on @entity0 ’s extradition , explaining the delay			1
@entity10 had considered @entity0 a fugitive because despite the fact that his bail in those initial days was conditioned on his return , he never did , ignoring the multiple summons issued to him over the years			1
the @entity137 government confirmed 3,787 deaths as a result of the tragedy , but unofficial estimates placed the toll at 15,000			0
more than a half - million people were injured , with many dying from illnesses including lung cancer , kidney failure and liver disease			1
eight @entity10 officials , including former @entity28 chairman @entity149 , were convicted on negligence charges in 2010 and sentenced to two years in prison			2
the nightmare , meanwhile , continues for the victims of that “ negligence ”			0
how @entity0 eluded us the leak from @entity1 's @entity18 - based pesticide factory killed thousands immediately four days after a deadly gas leak at @entity1 ’s plant in @entity18 killed thousands in 1984 , the company ’s chairman , @entity0 , was arrested on his arrival in the capital of @entity137			1
but after being held under house arrest for only a few hours , @entity0 posted bail and quickly left the country , never returning to face trial			1
several reports have suggested that the government of @entity170 was pressured by the @entity14 to let @entity0 go			0
senior @entity172 leader @entity171 , who was then the chief minister of @entity137 , wrote in his autobiography @entity173 of @entity174 in the @entity175 that home secretary @entity176 called him “ on the instructions of the then @entity28 home minister @entity178 ”			0
@entity176 denied the allegation , saying he was chief secretary of @entity180 at the time and became @entity28 home secretary only in january 1985			0
@entity171 died in 2011 after a prolonged illness			0
@entity184 , who was the @entity18 collector at the time of the disaster , said @entity0 managed to get away by using a phone in the room where he was detained to contact persons in the @entity14			1
“ had we removed the landline phone from his room , @entity0 would not have escaped			0
he possibly made calls to contacts in the @entity14 to help him leave @entity10 , ” @entity171 added			0
the @entity14 embassy reportedly mounted pressure on the @entity10 government , which released @entity0 on a personal bond of rs 25,000			1
@entity0 never returned to face trial and was declared a fugitive by the @entity10 courts			1
rights activists have blamed successive governments for failing to secure the extradition of the man who was held responsible for the death of around 15,000 people			1
over half a million people were injured by the gas , and many of them died slowly from illnesses like lung cancer , kidney failure and liver disease			1
@entity0 was arrested after the @entity110 took over the investigation on december 6 , 1984			2
while he was being held at the @entity1 guest house , he spoke to @entity10 officials and legal advisers of the company			1
the six - foot - two - inch tall executive , then aged 63 , wanted to visit the factory but was discouraged by the local administration			0
@entity223 , @entity18 ’s superintendent of police in 1984 , claimed @entity0 was arrested on a written order and released on an oral order			1
“ we arrested him on the basis of a written order but released him on an oral order , ” @entity223 told the @entity226			0
he added that the oral order came “ from higher - ups ” .			0

@entity0 was chairman of @entity1 when a gas leak at its @entity18 - based subsidiary killed thousands
the 1984 disaster is thought to have killed 15,000 people , and injured half a million
@entity0 was called to face trial in @entity10 , but never returned
