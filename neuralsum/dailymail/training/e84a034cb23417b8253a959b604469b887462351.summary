former @entity1 mayor @entity0 has been made an honorary knight by the @entity3			1
the 72 - year - old businessman and politician 's new title will be @entity0 , @entity7 ( @entity8 )			0
it comes just weeks after @entity10 was roundly criticised for breaking protocol by recounting a conversation he 'd had with the @entity3 while chatting to the former mayor of @entity1			1
the prime minister was overheard by a tv crew 's microphone telling mr @entity0 that the @entity3 had ' purred ' down the line when he informed her last month that @entity19 had rejected independence			1
sir @entity0 ( sort of ) : businessman and former @entity1 mayor @entity0 has been made a @entity22 billionaire mr @entity0 , who owns a £ 12million home in @entity25 's upmarket @entity24 and today said @entity26 was his ' second home ' , will not be travelling to @entity27 to meet the @entity3 , but said he was ' deeply honoured ' by the award			1
he has been given the honorary knighthood for his ' prodigious entrepreneurial and philanthropic endeavours , and the many ways in which they have benefited the @entity26 and the @entity26 - @entity36 special relationship ' , the @entity29 in @entity30 said in a statement			0
but the timing of the award may be regarded as somewhat unfortunate with mr @entity10 's gaffe still fresh in the memory			2
on a visit to @entity1 to attend the @entity43 , mr @entity10 was overheard to tell mr @entity0 : ' she purred down the line			1
i 've never heard someone so happy			0
' embarrassed mr @entity10 apologised for the incident and his aides in @entity50 have been in touch with @entity27			1
but he has yet to apologise in person , and is expected to say sorry to the @entity3 at their next formal audience			0
' definition of relief ' : the moment before @entity10 told @entity58 about the @entity3 ' purring down the line ' mr @entity0 , a self - confessed anglophile , has committed £ 42.4m in philanthropic support to the @entity26 as a foreign national mr @entity0 will be made an honorary knight , and will therefore not be sir @entity0 , but can , if he wishes , add @entity8 to the end of his name			1
non-british nationals can receive honorary awards awards for their important contribution to @entity26 interests			0
' as mayor of @entity1 , as a businessman , and as a philanthropist , @entity0 has played a key role in forging transatlantic diplomatic , economic , and cultural ties , ' @entity26 ambassador to the @entity36 sir @entity71 said today			2
' he has made a significant contribution to @entity26 business life through his firm , @entity58 , and the impact of his considerable philanthropic endeavours in the arts and education is felt by @entity26 every day			2
' big fan : @entity58 will not be travelling to @entity27 to meet the @entity3 , but said he was ' deeply honored ' to be awarded a knighthood upon accepting the title , mr @entity0 said : ' i am deeply honoured to receive this recognition , which is especially meaningful to me because of my close personal , business , and philanthropic ties to @entity25 and @entity26 , which stretch back four decades			1
' over those years it has been a great privilege to work with @entity26 leaders on a wide variety of issues , and to invest - commercially , culturally , and civically - in the future of @entity26 , a place i have long considered my second home			0
' as mayor of @entity1 , mr @entity0 got on famously well with @entity25 mayor @entity99 the pair worked together to boost travel between the @entity26 capital and @entity1			2
mr @entity0 , a self - confessed anglophile , is a ' great supporter of the arts and education in @entity26 ' and has committed more than £ 42.4million in philanthropic support to the @entity26			0
other @entity36 citizens who have been made honorary knights include @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 .			0

made @entity22
but former @entity1 mayor will not travel to @entity27 , heading off a *potentially* embarrassing encounter
honour comes just weeks after @entity10 breached protocol by recounting a conversation he 'd had with the queen to @entity58
@entity122 said she had ' purred down the line ' after he told her @entity19 had rejected independence
