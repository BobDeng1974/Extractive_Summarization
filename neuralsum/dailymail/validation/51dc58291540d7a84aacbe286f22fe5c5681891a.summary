the @entity1 has launched airstrikes against targets in @entity4 to support @entity6 ground forces trying to push @entity8 militants out of the city , a senior official said			1
@entity6 requested the strikes , which began wednesday and are ' ongoing , ' according to the unnamed @entity1 official			1
an @entity13 correspondent in @entity4 reported hearing warplanes overhead late wednesday , followed by multiple explosions			0
in an address to the nation wednesday evening , prime minister @entity26 predicted success in @entity4 but did not say the @entity1 was providing airstrikes			2
' we have started the final phase of the operation in @entity4 , ' he said			0
" you will liberate your ground , not anyone but you , " he said , in a speech to the @entity6 people			2
@entity39 praised all the groups involved in the battle against the @entity43 group , including the so - called @entity44 , which the @entity1 calls @entity25 - backed militias , the @entity47 tribes and coalition forces			1
he fell short of confirming that the coalition is playing a direct role in @entity4			0
@entity1 airstrikes in @entity4 raise highly sensitive questions about participating in an @entity6 campaign that has been spearheaded by @entity6 @entity21 militias trained and equipped by @entity25 , an avowed @entity1 adversary			1
difficulties : militias like the @entity58 , one of whose members is shown , have encircled @entity8 forces but have been unable to dislodge them from the city @entity25 has provided artillery and other weaponry for the @entity4 battle , and senior @entity25 advisers have helped @entity6 coordinate the offensive			1
@entity6 pointedly did not request @entity1 air support when it launched the offensive in early march and recently , the offensive has lost momentum			1
col @entity71 , a @entity72 spokesman , said wednesday the @entity6 forces have encircled @entity4 but not yet made significant inroads into the heavily defended city limits			1
' they are stalled , ' he said			0
the @entity1 has hundreds of military advisers in @entity6 helping its security forces plan operations against the @entity43 , which occupies large chunks of northern and western @entity6			1
but the @entity1 has said it is not coordinating any military actions with the @entity25			1
@entity71 said that at @entity83 's request the @entity1 began aerial surveillance over @entity4 in recent days and is sharing the collected intelligence with the @entity6 government			2
the @entity1 - led air campaign , launched in august and joined by several @entity89 allies , has allowed @entity6 forces to halt the @entity92 's advance and claw back some of the territory militants seized last summer			1
uneasy : militiamen guarding the front line in the battle between @entity6 forces and @entity8 militants , a battle which has ' stalled ' recently but the growing @entity25 presence on the ground has complicated the mission , with @entity103 refusing to work directly with a country it views as a regional menace , yet is currently embroiled with @entity25 in sensitive negotiations over a nuclear deal			1
the prominent role of the @entity21 militias in the fight to retake @entity4 and other parts of @entity6 's @entity47 heartland has meanwhile raised concerns that the offensive could deepen the country 's sectarian divide and drive @entity47 into the arms of the @entity43 group			2
@entity120 , leader of the @entity121 and a commander of @entity6 's @entity21 militias , told reporters in @entity125 : ' if we need them ( the @entity1 - led coalition ) we will tell them we need them			1
but we do n't need the coalition			0
we have surveillance planes over our heads already			0
the participation of @entity1 planes hinders out operations ... if we need it , we 'll tell our government what we need			2
' he claimed that the militias , the overwhelming majority of which is made up of @entity21 fighters , have their own surveillance drones			0
' we buy them anywhere , ' he said			0
' we have our own ... controlled by @entity6			0
' a series of @entity1 airstrikes north of @entity4 , in the vicinity of @entity147 , in recent weeks has had the indirect benefit of tying down @entity8 forces that might otherwise be operating in defense of @entity4			2
on wednesday , for example , the @entity1 military said it had conducted five airstrikes tuesday near @entity147 , home of a major oil refinery that @entity8 has sought to capture			2
that bombing targeted @entity8 combat units and destroyed what the @entity1 called an @entity8 ' fighting position , ' as well as an @entity8 armored vehicle			0
@entity71 said the @entity6 are discovering how difficult it can be to carry out ground operations in an urban area			0
' we heard quite a bit from the @entity6 and some even from the @entity25 â€” some fairly high - confidence statements about how rapidly the operations for @entity4 would go , " @entity71 said			1
" we 've seen otherwise			0
' ' i think it 's important that the @entity6 understand that what would be most helpful to them is a reliable partner in this fight against @entity8 , ' @entity71 said			0
' reliable , professional , advanced military capabilities are something that reside very clearly and very squarely with the coalition			0

@entity6 requested the airstrikes to support an offensive begun in early march
at the outset of the offensive , the @entity6 forces *declined* @entity1 - led coalition support though it looked to @entity25 for weapons and artillery
a @entity72 spokesman said the offensive has ' stalled '
