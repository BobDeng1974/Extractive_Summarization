residents have accused a council of painting ' pointless ' double yellow lines after two new no - parking zones measuring just 12 inches appeared on a @entity5 street			1
the road markings on @entity7 in @entity8 are big enough for a couple of toy cars - but could n't fit the tyre of a real one			1
@entity13 defended the decision , saying the lines are there to separate parking bays for residents from those reserved for hire cars			1
tight parking space : two sets of yellow lines were painted on @entity7 in @entity8 , east @entity5 close - up : the road markings , pictred , barely fit too toy cars - and are far too short for the tyre of a real one but the road markings do n't take the title of @entity30 's shortest double yellow lines - which are believed to be on @entity31 , in @entity32 , and measure just 11 inches			1
residents saw the funny side of the @entity5 no - parking zones			1
@entity36 said : ' what pointless double yellow lines			0
i suppose you can never be too careful though			0
' while @entity42 added : ' they must have problems with unicyclists parking there			0
' a spokesman for @entity13 said : ' these are installed to highlight the differing parking restrictions to motorists and to avoid any possible confusion as to what sign applies to which bay by providing some form of physical separation between the differing bays			2
' indeed in the past we have found that only providing a bay end markings to differentiate between contrasting parking bays can occasionally be obscured by the overhang of parked vehicles			1
' restrictions : @entity13 defended the decision to paint the 12 - inch road markings , pictured other contenders for @entity30 's most pointless road markings @entity31 , @entity32 these road markings on @entity31 in @entity67 are designed to separate a residents ' parking zone with a pay and display area and motorists who park on the lines will face a £ 50 or £ 70 fine			1
at the time , they took over the accolade of @entity30 's shortest double yellow lines from a set also in @entity32 - on @entity80 - which measure just 13 inches			0
but residents and motorists say the markings , which are about the same length as two @entity85 6 's , are a ' ridiculous ' waste of time and money and branded them ' pathetic '			0
the road markings are designed to separate a residents ' parking zone ( left ) with a pay and display area ( right ) the lines have taken over the title as @entity30 's shortest double yellows from another set in @entity32 @entity96 , @entity97 drivers in a village in south @entity100 were left bemused and confused after workmen painted double yellow lines - in a layby			1
the lines were painted in the village of @entity96 on the outskirts of @entity107			0
one driver spoke to one of the workmen , who admitted he had never put double yellow lines in a lay - by before			0
the double yellow lines lines were painted in the village of @entity96 on the outskirts of @entity107 @entity114 , @entity32 two sets of double yellow lines measuring just 13 inches long apiece were painted in between parking spaces on a residential road in @entity32			0
@entity119 say the lines are to deter drivers from encroaching on disabled parking bays			2
they were the shortest double yellow lines when they were painted in 2013 , but the title was taken last year by another @entity32 street			0
the tiny 13 - inch double yellow lines have been painted between official parking spaces in @entity32 @entity130 's walk in @entity131 , south - west @entity5 a council was accused of painting @entity30 ’s most pointless double yellow lines which measure just 18in - too small to fit a single tyre			1
residents were stunned when the lines appeared in @entity131 , south west @entity5 , last april , curved around a corner kerb at a three - way junction - but barely big enough for a toy car or a unicycle			2
the lines were today criticised by the @entity142 , which said it appeared to be ‘ another example of strict application of regulations failing the common sense test ’			0
