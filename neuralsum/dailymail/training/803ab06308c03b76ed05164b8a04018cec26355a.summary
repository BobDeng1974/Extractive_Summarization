by @entity0 former @entity2 swimming champion @entity1 is five kilograms heavier than her competitive weight and has never been happier			1
as an elite athlete , @entity1 , now 29 , did n’t have the opportunity to embrace her feminine qualities			1
‘ you ’re not a woman , you ’re an athlete so it ’s a very strong distinction between the two because you ’re not allowed to have breasts , hips or a butt - those things ca n’t be there , ’ she told the @entity7			2
@entity1 now exercises seven hours per week instead of the intense 35 - hour regime she endured when she was a professional swimmer @entity1 fell into a deep depression for six months when she first retired at the end of 2009 , after giving up on exercise which resulted in her gaining 10kg			1
‘ i tried to rebel against exercising , which you do after doing 35 hours a week of exercise for 10 years , but obviously it impacts on your mental and physical health , ’ she said			2
unsure of where to turn , @entity1 decided to go back to what she did best and got back into the pool			2
a third gold medal later , @entity1 retired again 12 months ago and is now just five kg heavier than her competitive weight , which she has maintained for the past eight months			1
those dark days are well and truly over for the @entity37 , who now exercises seven hours a week - one fifth of the regime she endured as a professional swimmer			2
‘ the second time , l feel like i ’m doing it better but being more patient with myself – a lot kinder and doing it with a lot more love , ’ she said			0
‘ i ’m never going to be six foot tall and stick thin			0
' i really love my body and i love all bodies – we all have such an amazing beauty that can just shine out of us			0
’ champion swimmer @entity1 has learnt to love her ' wobbly bits ' since retirement @entity1 ’s philosophy is to ‘ embrace your wobbly bits ’			1
‘ it ’s part of you and why ca n’t we love ourselves for what we are ? ‘ she said			0
‘ i ’m very lucky because my husband loves my wobbly bits and embraces them , and thinks i look fabulous , which is very nice for the ego			1
' she encourages everyone to take on her refreshing attitude to maintaining a healthy lifestyle			0
‘ i eat really well without restricting myself , so if i want to have pizza or ice cream i do but obviously all in moderation , ’ she said			0
' i exercise , i ’m strong , fit and really healthy , and if this is the weight i come to naturally then why not enjoy it and be happy with it ? ’ @entity1 has had to learn how to allow herself to be hungry			1
‘ it ’s been quite a process for me because i have never been hungry in my life because as an athlete you are constantly fuelling yourself , so i ’ve had to learn hunger and understand if i am hungry or i 'm just eating because that ’s what i ’m used to doing , ' she said			0
' that ’s the issue i got into in 2010 - i was just constantly feeding			0
’ despite being 5kg heavier than her competitive weight , @entity1 has never felt so good			1

former @entity2 swimmer @entity1 did *n't* feel like a woman when she was an elite athlete *due* to the pressures to be at the *top* of her game
@entity1 hit rock bottom in 2010 after gaining 10kg from no exercise
the triple medallist is now embracing her ' wobbly bits '
she is 5kg above her competitive weight and never felt better
