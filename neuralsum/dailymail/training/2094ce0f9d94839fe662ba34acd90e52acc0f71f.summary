@entity0 could build a case to sue @entity2 for breach of contract if he is banned for biting , according to a leading employment lawyer			1
the striker is at the centre of yet more controversy after appearing to sink his teeth into @entity10 during @entity13 's @entity12 clash against @entity14 in @entity15 on tuesday			1
world governing body @entity16 is now investigating the matter and the 27 - year - old could face a lengthy ban that could be extended to club football			0
cover up ? @entity2 holds his teeth in pain after allegedly biting @entity14 's @entity10 inhumane : @entity2 appears to bite @entity10 during the @entity23 showdown evidence : @entity10 shows the damage inflicted by @entity2 that could result in @entity0 suing the striker nonplussed : @entity2 ( left ) celebrates @entity13 's 1 - 0 win over @entity14 with his team - mate @entity28 dispute : @entity0 could sue their striker @entity2 for breach of contract after his bite on @entity10 @entity2 has twice been banned for biting opponents in the past			1
last year he was banned for 10 matches for biting @entity38 's @entity37 while he incurred a seven - game suspension for a similar offence while at @entity41 in 2010			1
@entity42 , employment law partner at national law firm @entity44 , said : ' the general position is that @entity2 's behaviour in the work environment would usually represent gross misconduct ( given that it could be classified as an assault ) and would usually result in the dismissal of an employee in most circumstances			1
' if the matter has occurred outside of work and is not connected to it , for example in the form of a work social , the issue for the employer would usually be whether the actions of the employee had brought the business into disrepute			0
' in the case of @entity2 this could easily be argued - particularly as it is the second time an incident like this has happened whilst he has been with the club ( and third time overall ) , and the @entity72 club stood by the player last time despite risk to their reputation and despite his lengthy ban			2
controversy : @entity2 ( top left ) is captured biting @entity38 defender @entity37 in april 2013 hurt ? @entity2 holds his mouth after the incident with @entity10 and he could receive a lengthy ban ' the decision for @entity0 however is not really about whether they do what a ' normal employer ' may do			1
' with @entity86 and @entity87 apparently planning to make significant bids for the player after the @entity12 , the decision is whether they are willing to dismiss a player and waive a potential huge transfer fee			2
' much will depend on what punishment @entity16 hands down but if the ban is sufficiently long so that @entity2 is unable to fulfil his contract , this so - called ' frustration of contract ' could lead to claims by @entity0 for breach of contract on the part of @entity2			2
' the latest @entity2 incident in the group match in @entity103 came amid growing speculation linking the @entity106 player of the year with a big - money move to @entity86			0
previous : @entity2 received a seven game ban for biting @entity110 's @entity109 while playing for @entity41 , 2010 bite : @entity2 appears to sink his teeth into @entity114 defender @entity10 during the @entity12 encounter @entity117 champions @entity87 have previously been linked with the player			1
it remains to be seen whether such apparent interest is now tempered			0
@entity0 have declined to comment on the matter			0
it is understood the club intend to let @entity16 's process take its course before making their position clear			0
yet with @entity2 having also been involved in numerous other controversies since joining @entity0 in 2011 - most infamously a race row with @entity131 's @entity130 that led to an eight - match ban - there is the potential for embarrassment for the @entity136			0
@entity42 said : ' it will be interesting to see how the situation develops over the next few days and what stance @entity0 take in relation to their highest - profile and most - valued employee			0
