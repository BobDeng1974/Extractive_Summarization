by @entity0 published : 06:23 est , 19 september 2012 updated : 05:14 est , 20 september 2012 weighing less than three stone , @entity1 could not even lie down on a bed without bruising her fragile skin			1
her body ravaged by anorexia , the private schoolgirl was repeatedly told by her doctors that hers was the worst case they had ever seen			2
but @entity1 , then 14 , took their warnings as a badge of honour , proud to be seen as the ‘ best anorexic ’			1
recovery : @entity1 , 22 , is now healthy and looking forward to the future eight years after she started to suffer from anorexia			1
pictured , right , still painfully thin aged 20 now , after an eight - year recovery , @entity1 has decided to release pictures of herself at her thinnest in a bid to show other teens just how damaging an obsession with dieting can be			1
‘ at the time , i did n’t realise how ill i was			1
i did n’t realise what i was doing to myself and my family , ’ said @entity1 , now 22			1
‘ i was so thin that i could n’t even sleep on a normal hospital bed			2
my bones were like razor blades jutting out and i was left bruised			2
‘ even an airbed was too rough for me , so they had to wrap me in my dressing gown and sheepskin blankets			2
’ @entity1 has set up a foundation with two friends , to help anorexics and their families when she turned 14 , @entity1 weighed seven stone and played competitive sport at her private school in @entity39			1
but her weight quickly dropped after she developed an obsession with seeing how much she could lose			2
within six months , it had plummeted to just over five stone and she was admitted to @entity45 hospital in @entity39 , the first of many times she would stay at the hospital throughout her teens			2
at her worst , she weighed a skeletal 2st 12lb			0
‘ i ca n’t even really remember how it started , ’ said @entity1 , now a bar manager			1
‘ it certainly was n’t a vanity thing , as i was a very sporty teenager and was n’t chubby at all			0
‘ i have a very addictive personality and i remember trying to see how thin i could get			0
’ @entity1 began making herself sick but after she was caught by her mother she decided to starve herself instead			1
her family begged her to eat but she refused and had to be removed from school and admitted to hospital , where she refused to be treated , pulling out feeding tubes			0
on one occasion it took four nurses to hold her down to force - feed her			0
two years later , on a shopping trip with her father , @entity1 began to realise the harm she was doing to herself			1
at one point , she felt so weak he had to carry her up a flight of stairs			0
she later collapsed crossing a road and only narrowly avoided being hit by a car			1
@entity1 was so thin at one point that even lying on a hospital bed left her bruised ‘ it was only then that i thought , “ maybe i ’m not so well ” , she said			1
‘ it was n’t like a magic switch suddenly turned on though			0
it was still a long and difficult journey			0
@entity77 was like a prison that i could n’t escape from			0
‘ i could see the devastating effect this was having on my parents and i did n’t know how to help them , but i thought , “ i ca n’t lose my family , they mean everything to me ”			0
’ it has taken @entity1 a further six years to come to terms with looking healthy			1
she refuses to weigh herself as part of her treatment , but thinks she is now about eight stone			0
she has now set up a support group with two friends who also had anorexia			2
the @entity93 aims to visit hospitals to advise doctors and nurses on the best tactics they can use to get anorexics to eat , while providing help to family members			0
‘ only in the last year have i been at semi-peace with myself			0
i have realised the most important things are having a baby , having a career and having a healthy body to carry me through life , ’ @entity1 added			1
‘ some of my friends i was in hospital with , who were n’t as ill as i was , have died			2
i ’m so lucky to be here			0
‘ i want to take something positive from this horrible experience , and do all i can to help other people who are suffering			0

@entity1 developed eating *disorder* when she was 14
only realised she was ill after she collapsed in a road
has now set up a foundation to help others with the condition
