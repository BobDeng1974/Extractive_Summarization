residents of @entity1 now have a new option when filling up their cars - fuels created from human waste			1
an experimental project from the @entity7 hopes to prove that human waste can have its uses as a fuel			1
it is even working with car maker @entity12 , which is set to begin leasing cars that can use the new fuel - for free			1
powered by @entity15 : @entity12 plans to begin leasing a fuel - cell version of its @entity18 crossover , which can travel about 480 kilometers on a tank of hydrogen			1
first , sewage is separated into water and biosolids			0
the waste water is cleaned , filtered and treated for reuse , while solid waste is piped into airless tanks filled with microbes			0
a byproduct of their digestion is a gas that ’s 60 percent methane and about 40 percent carbon dioxide , which is burned at the plant for power generation			0
however , some is filtered and piped into a unique , stationary ' tri-generation ' fuel - cell device , designed by the @entity40 team , that produces electricity , heat and hydrogen			2
the hydrogen gas is then piped several hundred feet to the public pump where fuel - cell autos are refueled daily			2
inventor @entity47 developed the system wit fellow scientists from @entity51 ’s @entity50			0
they developed a sytem that feeds the solid waste to microbes			0
the gas they give off is then burnt for power , while some is kept back and used to fuel hydrogen powered cars			1
however , one downside has been that the @entity64 ’s @entity63 waste facility does have a certain unique aroma			0
' it smells like money , ' @entity47 optimistically told @entity68			0
the team built the @entity63 project with about $ 10 million in funding from sources including @entity74 government bodies and a @entity77 @entity76 grant , and it makes enough hydrogen to supply about 200 fuel - cell vehicles each day			1
@entity47 's customers are soon set to increase			0
@entity12 plans to begin leasing a fuel - cell version of its @entity18 crossover , which can travel about 480 kilometers on a tank of hydrogen			1
the lease price will be $ 2,999 down and $ 499 a month , @entity12 said - which includes free fuel from nearly a dozen hydrogen pumps around the state			1
@entity12 is also partnering with @entity89 to make the @entity90 available to consumers in the @entity93 / @entity1 region			2
@entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 are also beginning to sell hydrogen cars in the region			0
@entity99 : researchers say human waste is a viable source of power for hydrogen cars the fuel - cell powered @entity18 can drive for 50 miles per kilogram of hydrogen , and its two tanks hold about 5.64 kilograms ( 12.4 pounds )			1
costs of compressed gas in @entity74 range from about $ 5 to $ 10 per kilogram , depending on the facility , and it takes around three minutes to fill the tank			0
@entity12 says it hopes the technology will become popular - and will take on the electric car as the eco-vehicle of choice			0
' hydrogen - powered fuel cell electric vehicles represent the next generation of zero - emission vehicle technology , so we ’re thrilled to be a leader in offering the mass - produced , federally certified @entity90 to retail customers , ' said @entity125 of @entity126			1
' the superior range and fast - fill refueling speed of our @entity18 fuel cell vehicle contrast with the lower range and slow - charge characteristics of competing battery electric vehicles			2
' we think fuel cell technology will increase the adoption rate of zero - emission vehicles , and we ’ll all share the environmental benefits			2

fuel cell cars can be *refilled* from stations powered by human waste
waste taken directly from @entity74 's sewage system
@entity12 will lease cars with *unlimited* *refills* of hydrogen fuel
