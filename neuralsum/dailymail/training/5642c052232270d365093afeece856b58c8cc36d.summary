those @entity1 fans who have chanted ' four - four - two ' at @entity2 during some laboured performances this season should readjust their red - tinted spectacles			1
sir @entity6 might have been the greatest manager of the @entity8 era but the notion he sent out every @entity1 team to win 7 - 6 in an orgy of reckless abandon is nonsense			1
in 2008/09 , @entity6 's @entity1 drew 0 - 0 on nine occasions when they had a forward line of @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			1
there were n't many complaints when they won the @entity8 and reached the @entity23 final			2
@entity1 captain @entity17 has been deployed in a range of different playing roles this season although @entity17 is traditionally considered a striker , he has recently been dropped deep into central midfield @entity1 chief @entity2 has experimented with tactics and formations since taking over at @entity30 @entity31 has been given little credit for steadying the @entity1 ship after they failed to qualify for @entity35 last season			1
they travel to @entity38 today well set to finish in the top four having conceded one goal in their last six games and nine in their last 18			0
however , their last two away games , a 2 - 0 win at @entity46 and goalless @entity47 draw with @entity48 , have been met with disgruntlement from supporters who somehow feel the team should never look laboured in any circumstances			0
@entity31 does n't play with two out - and - out wingers like sir @entity54 and @entity6 , in his earlier years , did			1
but very few do anymore in the @entity8			2
the @entity55 tries to be adventurous in a different way , getting his defenders to push up with the ball so that the team have controlled possession nearer the opposition goal			0
' yes , he wants the responsibility to be on the centre - backs , he does n't want us to play the easy option , ' says defender @entity66			2
' it gives us more responsibility to really drive out and find those passes as a lot of teams drop off , and if we can get the ball to the midfielders when they are higher up , rather than dropping in , we are more of a threat			0
' @entity17 has scored eight goals this season and has made 5 assists for @entity1 @entity1 defender @entity66 says that @entity2 places more responsibility on the centre - backs @entity1 are hardly playing an ultra-defensive , @entity81 style			1
their @entity8 goal tally of 39 in 23 games is higher than at this stage last season and fourth - best in the division going into today 's fixtures			1
@entity92 to @entity31 's philosophy of wearing teams down rather than instantly going for the throat is the deployment of @entity94 centre - forward @entity17 in midfield			1
@entity17 has bristled when he has played there under previous managers and while @entity31 admits he needed to persuade his captain , he claims 29 - year - old @entity17 now enjoys it in the engine room			1
as a striker , you are reliant on getting service from other players , in midfield you can control a game through your own efforts			0
' it 's about communication and me giving my arguments why he has to do that , ' says @entity31			2
' and , yes , sometimes convincing him he has to do something for the team			0
but i do n't think he ever complains about where he has to play			0
and he is also liking to play in midfield because he is more on the ball			2
' @entity17 's stats show that he is adapting to his new life in midfield away from acting as a striker @entity17 's statistics show that he performs better for @entity1 when played in midfield @entity2 was convinced from the day he took over at @entity30 that @entity17 could star as a midfielder for @entity1 - and how right he was			1
@entity17 began the season leading the line as @entity1 struggled but , as the statistics show , he has been far more influential since dropping into midfield			1
rooney averages 31 touches and 24 successful passes more as a midfielder and has also created more chances			0
@entity17 's versatility has been an occasional curse during his career and @entity31 admits he has to tread sensitively			1
but he loves the fact his captain can play well anywhere ; central midfield , no 10 , inside - left , striker or even wide - right , as he appeared on tuesday night in a 3 - 0 @entity47 win against @entity142			1
' not many players can play in as many positions as @entity17 because he is multi-functional			1
but that is also not always a benefit for him			0
a player normally does n't like that so i have to take care of that , ' admits @entity31			2
' i like multi-functional players because you can be more varied and more unpredictable for opponents when you change positions			0
' when i had that team at @entity157 [ 1995 @entity23 winners ] , i changed @entity158 from a winger to midfield , @entity160 was a no 10 and i made him a right - back			2
@entity162 came as a no 6 right midfielder and i made him a centre - half			0
with @entity17 that is possible			0
' @entity17 has scored eight goals and has five assists this season			0
but as he closes in on sir @entity172 's @entity1 goalscoring record , his manager ca n't make any promises about how often he will play up front in the future			1
it was noticeable against @entity142 that @entity177 was pushed forward while @entity17 's role seemed to be delivering crosses			0
@entity31 also has @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity182 to choose from up front			0
the @entity1 manager says : ' @entity17 's position depends on the shape of the team and the form of the strikers			1
@entity1 ran out convincing 3 - 0 winners against @entity142 in the @entity47 last time out @entity2 recalls how he converted @entity158 from a winger to a central midfielder while at @entity157 considering @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity182 , playing @entity17 up front is not a given ' i know i can always use him but i also know i can not change him so easily from midfielder to striker during a game because i did it once and he was not so good			1
he can be better moving from striker to midfielder , rather than the other way around			0
when we play with three defenders and four midfield players , maybe inside - left is better for him			2
but when we have a different system and need someone right - footed on the wing , he is on the right			0
' that is what i am saying to @entity17 â€” your contribution for the team is bigger when you play at right - half			1
why ? you can cross and can pass better as you are on the right side			0
then you can prepare overlaps of @entity219			0
' and , of course , while @entity220 is injured , @entity17 can dictate play from a central area			2
whatever the system , @entity31 is aware the responsibility of being @entity1 manager is to entertain , and win			1
he spoke about the ' @entity227 ' on friday as the club marked the 57th anniversary of the @entity231 air crash and said afterwards : ' it does n't matter , wingers or not wingers , three or four at the back , it is about being effective			0
' @entity1 fans put a curse on the previous manager whenever they sang : ' come on @entity238 , play like @entity6 's boys			2
' as @entity31 prepares for a difficult afternoon in the trenches at @entity241 , a little understanding from his own following would n't go amiss			0
@entity17 's versatility will be used by @entity2 and the @entity1 captain will play where they ' need him most '			1

@entity2 has experimented with his tactics at @entity1
he has also tried out a number of different formations
captain @entity17 has been dropped deeper into midfield
@entity31 says @entity17 will *continue* to play a variety of roles
statistically , the 29 - year - old performs better in midfield
@entity1 are third in the @entity8 table
