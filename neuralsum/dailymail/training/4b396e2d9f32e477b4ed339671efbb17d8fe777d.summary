‘ only my brother ’s ever seen me play before , so for me it ’ll be a special experience to play in front of so many of my friends and family who try to keep up with me over here			0
it ’ll be the experience of a lifetime			0
‘ man , i ’ve got about 30 people coming to the game – people just think the tickets are free ! i ’m going to spend time with them , with my family , and try to see them as much as i can while i ’m here			0
’ having spent his formative years in the @entity54 capital , @entity0 knows exactly what to expect			2
it appears some of his team - mates , however , have n’t been so impressed with the city ’s characteristic weather so far			1
‘ for people who have n’t been here before , @entity7 is a hard city to adjust to , especially at this time of year , ’ he continued			2

‘ some people over here say it ’s soft because we wear so much equipment , but it ’s different to rugby because that ’s more of a side - to - side game whereas @entity114 is head - on so you need the equipment , otherwise your career will only last a couple of weeks			0
