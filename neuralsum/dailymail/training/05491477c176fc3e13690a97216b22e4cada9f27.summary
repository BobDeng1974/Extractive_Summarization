@entity0 can still remember the jeers and boos which rang out the only time he played his next @entity5 opponent , @entity4			1
it was at @entity7 in 2010 and @entity0 was in one of his prolonged @entity10 slumps — still trying to get over the fact that he could not clinch a @entity13 title , having fallen short in the @entity15 final			1
@entity0 was so poor that he managed only three games on that sunny @entity17 afternoon			1
‘ at the beginning of the clay - court season i ’ve had some tough matches over the years , it just was n’t a pleasant memory for me , ’ said @entity0			1
eyes on the task : @entity0 will take on @entity4 in the third round at @entity5 fast forward four years and two of those craved - for major titles are in the bag plus an @entity31 gold			1
so it is sure to be a different version of the 27 - year - old @entity34 that @entity4 encounters in this third - round meeting which is scheduled to be fourth on court in the early evening			1
what happened in @entity39 has limited significance today , but the world no 24 should provide a good test and is dangerous for @entity0			1
the @entity43 has yet to drop a set this week and the more looping style of ball he hits means there will be few mistakes for the @entity50 no 1 to benefit from			2
@entity0 said : ‘ he ’s a quality player			2
he ’s had big results here before , beating @entity53 in 2009 and winning last week			0
it ’s going to be a very tough match for me so i ’ll need to play well because when i played him before when i did n’t play well , it was a pretty quick win for him			0
’ tough day at the office : @entity0 looks dejected after a thrashing at the hands of @entity4 in 2010 @entity4 , who won the @entity62 event in @entity63 , once worked with @entity0 ’s ex-coach @entity64 , which is one of their few connections			1
on that eternal subject , @entity0 also offered further illuminating thoughts over why he believes a female coach such as @entity71 might be right for him			2
‘ when you get a lot of men in a room , there ’s often quite a lot of egos and communication can be difficult because not everyone listens , ’ he said			0
‘ when there ’s an argument it can get heated rather than everyone staying calm			0
in those situations , women can listen a bit better and take things on board easier than guys			0
fired up : @entity4 lets out a roar as he beat @entity94 's @entity93 in the second round ‘ from a communication point of view , it would be pretty good			2
whether it ’s a man or a woman , when they look at the game , it ’s just important that they see the differences in the two games — like in women ’s tennis , the serve is n’t as important as in the men ’s game			0
‘ in women ’s matches , you need to start incredibly quickly			0
and in a best - of - five - set match , you need to pace yourself more			0
‘ so there are things but so long as the person understands that , they can easily work with both : a man can work with a woman or a woman can work with a man			0
’ seat to be filled : @entity0 is still to appoint a permanent coach after he split with @entity124 in march			2

@entity0 takes on @entity43 @entity4 in the last *32* on *saturday*
@entity4 won their only meeting on the clay of @entity7 in 2010
