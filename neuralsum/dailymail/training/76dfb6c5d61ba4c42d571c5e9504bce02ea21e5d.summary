are @entity0 right to stand by @entity1 ? @entity0 scored another massive pr own goal last night after allowing @entity1 to contest the @entity4 ’s claim that a three - game ban for biting is not harsh enough			1
@entity1 accepted an @entity4 charge of violent conduct for his outrageous attack on @entity11 ’s @entity10 at @entity12 on sunday			1
but the @entity13 and his employers have risked yet another backlash after making it clear to the governing body that they will appeal should an independent disciplinary commission hand down a more severe punishment than the standard three - match suspension			1
a three - man panel will convene on wednesday morning to consider the evidence submitted by both the @entity4 and @entity0			1
jaws of despair : @entity1 's latest controversy has landed him in further hot water with the @entity4 they could decide that three games is sufficient punishment but a far more likely outcome is that @entity1 will face a ban which will keep him out of action for the start of next season			1
an @entity4 statement read : ‘ @entity1 has today ( tuesday ) accepted a charge of violent conduct , following an incident with @entity11 ’s @entity10 in sunday ’s fixture at @entity12			1
‘ however , @entity1 has denied the @entity4 ’s claim that the standard punishment of three matches is clearly insufficient for this offence			1
‘ the incident was not seen by the match officials and has therefore been retrospectively reviewed			0
’ or disgusted ? perhaps the taste of @entity10 's arm is still in the forward 's mouth the tribunal will take into consideration past behaviour and previous cases before reaching a conclusion on @entity1 , who was banned for seven games after he bit @entity58 ’s @entity57 in november 2010			1
@entity60 ’s @entity59 escaped a long ban and fine in october 2006 as he was booked after biting @entity62 , then of @entity63			0
had @entity1 been booked last sunday , the @entity4 would have still had the power to take him to task as the rules have changed since then			2
having accepted the @entity4 ’s charge , @entity1 will start his ban this weekend			1
he will miss the trip to @entity70 on saturday , the @entity72 derby at @entity12 on may 5 and @entity0 ’s visit to @entity74 on may 12			0
or concern ? perhaps @entity1 is worrying about how much first - team football he 's likely to miss speaking out : prime minister @entity76 said the @entity4 need to take a hard line disbelief : the @entity11 defender did n't seem to know how to react after he was bitten by @entity1 yesterday but , by promising to defend their player against a possible longer ban , @entity0 can expect more condemnation as they have already been rebuked for failing to administer their own suspension			1
the matter has been taken so seriously that the prime minister entered the debate on monday			0
@entity1 was fined an undisclosed amount — thought to be two weeks ’ wages , a figure that equates to more than £ 200,000 — on monday morning			0
he insisted that the money be donated to the @entity90			0
the 26 - year - old was warned by managing director @entity92 that he was on his last chance at @entity12			0
the @entity95 striker was found guilty by the @entity4 in december 2011 of using racially abusive language to @entity97			2
@entity0 have stressed that @entity1 , who has been strongly linked with @entity98 , will not be sold this summer and have vowed to work with him to improve his behaviour			2
@entity101 @entity0 's managing director on @entity1 controversy out and about : a sombre - looking @entity1 is pictured in @entity0 on monday morning confrontation : the @entity11 star made no secret of his unhappiness over the incident with the @entity0 man look , ref : @entity10 shows his arm to referee @entity110 following the biting incident at @entity12 yesterday previous : @entity1 bites @entity57 of @entity58 while playing for @entity112 repeat ? the @entity58 star was as perplexed as @entity10 by @entity1 's behaviour @entity0 forward @entity1 is back in the spotlight after appearing to bite @entity11 defender @entity10 on the arm during the 2 - 2 draw with @entity11 at @entity12 , going on to score a late equaliser			1
here are some of the previous controversies surrounding the @entity13 forward			0
