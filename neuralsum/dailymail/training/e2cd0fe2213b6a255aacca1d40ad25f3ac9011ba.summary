@entity9 named ‘ his ’ players as @entity20 , fast bowlers @entity49 , @entity51 and @entity52 , wicket keeper @entity53 , and batsmen @entity54 and @entity56 , although prosecutor @entity57 said the agent explained that there was a ‘ little question mark ’ about @entity56			1

’ the journalist asked whether @entity20 could be trusted , to which the agent allegedly replied : ‘ @entity20 is one million per cent trustworthy			2
’ but on august 21 @entity20 did not play the maiden over as planned at the @entity82 after he ended up batting earlier than expected , the court heard			1
captain : the court heard @entity20 betrayed his team and his country by his alleged involvement in the cricket scandal allegations : the group is accused of trying to fix parts of a test match at @entity90 last year mr @entity57 said : ‘ as events were to transpire at the @entity82 , matters were somewhat out of @entity20 ’s control			2

bowler @entity160 , left , and agent @entity9 @entity9 told the journalist that the cricketers he worked with had agreed to fix parts of their next game for him during two ‘ brackets ’ - a set period on which to bet - in return for £ 150,000 , the court heard			1

no - balls are the easiest and the clearest , ’ he allegedly said			0
under the spotlight : @entity160 , left , @entity20 , right , and @entity49 , centre , pictured after the @entity207 published its story in september last year in the video the agent told the journalist that the no - balls would be delivered by @entity51 as the first ball of the third over , by @entity49 as the last ball of the 10th over and by @entity51 as the last ball of his first over to a right - handed @entity15 batsman			2
@entity9 allegedly said the no - balls would be ‘ well over the mark ’ to ensure that they were noted by the match officials			2
mr @entity57 commented : ‘ no umpire could possibly miss it			0
@entity49 , with his tact and greater experience would bowl a no - ball which could not fail to be called , but only inches over the popping - crease			0
‘ the relatively hapless @entity51 would end up bowling no - balls that , as a seasoned cricket statistician will tell you , were the biggest no - balls he ’s ever seen			0
’ @entity229 footage of the @entity231 ’s match was played in court , and the prosecutor noted that @entity51 ’s first invalid delivery was ‘ an enormous no - ball ’			2
yesterday mr @entity57 told the court the cricketers were deeply involved in ‘ rampant corruption ’ at the heart of the sport			0
in his opening speech to the jury he said the men betrayed millions of fans to cash in on a betting industry worth up to £ 33billion a year on the @entity246 sub-continent alone			0
mr @entity57 told @entity8 that the sums gambled overseas were ‘ breathtaking ’ and the men were motivated purely by greed			2
he said : ‘ this case reveals a depressing tale of rampant corruption at the heart of international cricket , with the key players being members of the @entity5 cricket team			0
‘ there are vast amounts of money to be made in any betting activity if the results are known in advance , and all of that was at the expense of the integrity of the game			0
’ allegations of match - fixing shook the sport to the core when the now defunct sunday newspaper published the revelations in august last year			0
