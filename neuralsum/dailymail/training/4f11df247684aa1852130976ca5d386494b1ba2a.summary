by @entity1 reporter published : 00:58 est , 24 august 2012 updated : 01:01 est , 24 august 2012 @entity2 spent the first month of his life in intensive care 150 miles from home , but his parents could see him any time thanks to a webcam in the premature baby 's incubator in @entity10 , @entity11			1
they could n't be there because they had another young child to care for and the father had used up his leave during the final weeks of the complicated pregnancy			0
so instead , @entity18 and @entity19 of @entity20 , @entity11 , used the device to further a bonding process that doctors say is crucial			1
the importance of feeling close to babies — for the babies as well as their parents — has transformed newborn intensive care units around the country			1
instead of brief visiting hours , for instance , many allow parents 24 - hour access			1
keeping watch : a webcam feed on an @entity37 of four - month - old @entity38 in the @entity39 at @entity40 , at her family 's home in @entity43 , @entity44 the next step in the process involves webcam technology that has had applications ranging from peering into eagles ' nests to linking soldiers in war zones with their loved ones back home			1
now parents , grandparents and friends can log in to babycams in hospitals around the @entity60 and several countries			1
at least eight domestic hospitals have installed such systems , and several dozen others are testing trial setups			1
@entity66 said nurses at the @entity69 hospital often put notes on camera			2
she read from some that were captured in screenshots : ‘ i 'm now 4 ( pounds ) 1 oz. @entity75 ! ’ ‘ be back soon			0
gon na try to breathe on my own too			0
taking the breathing tube out			0
’ the @entity77 in @entity10 was among the first to install webcams in neonatal intensive care units back in 2006 , and it had to create its own system			2
now , the chairman of the hospital 's @entity83 department has passed on his software to a @entity87 hospital , while at least two companies are selling contracts for similar systems			1
bonding time : @entity92 and @entity93 , with their daughter @entity94 , age two , watch their fourth - month - old daughter @entity97 who was born in april at 24 weeks at @entity69 and @entity99 , a speaker inside each incubator lets parents coo , talk and sing to their babies			1
that 's not available through the 53 cameras recently installed at @entity107 near @entity108 by @entity109 of @entity110 , @entity111			0
company owner @entity112 says about 200 of the 600 - plus @entity113 caring for critically ill newborns have asked for information ; he has installed six systems and has trial setups at about 40 other hospitals			1
the systems are n't used by doctors and nurses for clinical care in the @entity60 the system made by @entity112 's company does n't store any video			1
people watching a baby can take screenshot ‘ photographs , ’ but the video is gone as soon as it 's transmitted , @entity112 said			0
parents use the @entity60 systems for free , and they typically get a password — which they can share with family and friends — to log in to a secure server to watch their baby			1
developers of the systems say they could be adapted for use with different types of patients			2
for example , @entity112 said he 's been asked about setting up webcams for nursing home residents but has n't begun developing such a system			2
@entity147 : at least eight @entity60 hospitals have installed webcam systems in newborn @entity150 , and several dozen others are testing trial setups @entity92 and @entity93 can see little @entity153 in person every day , even though their home in @entity43 , @entity44 , is only about a half - hour drive from @entity157			1
she was born april 14 at 24 weeks , weighing 1lb , 3 ounces			2
still , they check on her regularly , sometimes at night			0
it can offer a huge sense of relief , said @entity93 : ‘ if you wake up at 2 in the morning you 're able to pull her up on the camera and see she 's all right			0
’ sometimes nurses alert the @entity166 to events , such as when they took @entity153 off a ventilator and substituted a nasal tube to an oxygen tank			0
‘ right after they did that , @entity172 , her main nurse , called and said , “ you need to look at the camera , ” ’ @entity171 recalled			0
‘ i was at work			0
i looked at the camera and said , “ oh , my god ! ” ’ doctors at the hospital in @entity10 say webcam monitoring of newborns in intensive care is more than a feel - good gimmick in an age of instant communication			1
rather , they hope to reduce a number of problems that can occur when the babies go home by increasing bonding with parents			1
remote access : parents can log in to a secure server to watch their baby in the hospital premature babies are more likely to be irritable or have physical or emotional problems , said dr @entity201 , chairman of the @entity202 at @entity69			1
in turn , the tiny babies are more likely to be shaken or beaten — which doctors think can be avoided through greater bonding			1
‘ if their parents have n't bonded with them , they 'll have problems , @entity201 said			2
a pilot study will compare bonding among parents who use the system frequently and those who use it less often			2
another will see whether babies show a physical response , such as changed heart or breathing rates , to hearing their parents			2
cameras are built into 21 of the hospital 's 64 incubators			2
the sickest babies usually get the cameras , said nurse @entity225 , who also runs a telemedicine program for women who live in remote parts of the state and are undergoing high - risk pregnancies			0
important service : the sickest babies usually get the cameras over their cribs , allowing parents to keep track of their recovery from home ‘ they tend to put them on babies that are going to be here a longer period of time , ’ she said			1
@entity201 said the hospital pays about $ 9,000 per camera			0
‘ with a prototype you need to overbuild , ’ he said			0
‘ now we 're talking about a more basic version that could be sold for a couple - thousand or less			0
’ ‘ a lot of it 's about bonding and keeping families together , largely			0
if you live three hours away , four hours away , and your baby 's going to be here four months it 's hard to do that economically , ’ he said			0
‘ this is not the same as being there but it 's more like being there than talking to the nurse that 's seeing and watching the baby			0

at least eight @entity60 hospitals have newborn webcam systems in place
parents can log in to secure server and watch their newborn 24 hours a day
babies with more severe problems who are likely to stay in the hospital longer get webcams
doctors hope to prevent problems associated with premature babies by increasing bonding with parents
