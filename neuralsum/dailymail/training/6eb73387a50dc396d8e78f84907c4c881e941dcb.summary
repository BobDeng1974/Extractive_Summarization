@entity6 recorded himself imitating a @entity7 from the “ @entity9 ” films			1
the then 14 - year - old ’s awkward display captivated the internet ’s attention causing the clip to become one of @entity2 ’s earliest viral hits			1
while the video was a runaway success , the teenage became a target for both online and offline bullies			1
ten years on since the video did the rounds , @entity6 , the 14 - year - old boy in the clip is speaking out about how it changed his life			1
@entity6 never intended for the clip to spread in quite the way it did			1
he put a @entity43 tape into his school 's video camera , grabbed a golf ball retriever , and pressed record			1
classmates found the tape and uploaded it online			2
and so a new celebrity was born : @entity6			1
it brought a type of fame and celebrity that @entity6 did not want			1
' what i saw was mean			0
it was violent , ' the @entity58 native , now 25 , tells @entity60 ' people were telling me to commit suicide			0
' speaking up : now a law - school graduate , @entity6 decided to speak out about his experience following a spate of high - profile cyber bullying which have led to suicide			1
wishes : @entity6 says he hopes speaking out about his experiences will help the victims of cyberbullying and unfortunate memes the bullying got so bad that @entity6 was forced to quit school and ended up checking into a psychiatric ward with severe depression			1
' no matter how hard i tried to ignore people telling me to commit suicide , i could n’t help but feel worthless , like my life was n’t worth living , ' he said			0
front page : @entity6 , 24 , one of the first people to gain notoriety from a viral video , is the subject of a cover story for @entity88 two major news magazines this week			1
he has talking about what it is like to be cyber-bullied he tells @entity91 how the whole thing started : ' i made the video in november 2002 , when i was a member of the school 's television club			1
i 'd been working on a @entity9 parody with other students for a gala			1
one evening , while i was alone in the studio , i practiced the choreography ... most 14 - year - old boys would do something similar in that situation , maybe more graceful , but i was goofing around			2
i left the tape on a shelf in the studio			0
i did n't think about hiding it			0
who would take the trouble to watch it ? ' he says that everything rapidly degenerated			0
in the common room , students climbed onto tabletops to insult him and people made fun of hie weight and appearance			2
he was given the label ' @entity6 '			1
' they did n't mean it as a compliment , ' he says , ' it soon became impossible for me to attend classes			0
' he tried to do something about the bullying			0
his dad called the school but the principal and teachers did n't understand and the police said there was nothing they could do			0
@entity6 sat his exams in a psychiatric unit of a hospital			1
in the end , he and his dad decided to sue the school for not taking care of him and the media too in the hope that they would stop showing the video			2
@entity6 maintains , the money he received did not even cover expenses			2
although he was invited onto talk shows , he did not believe it was for the right reasons			0
@entity6 felt he was being portrayed as a laughing stock , a circus act rather than for doing something truly worthwhile			2
he described the experience to the @entity152 magazine as humiliating			0
despite all of his misgivings about the past , @entity6 says he would n't change a thing			2
' today i 'm happy with who i am ... i 'm the product of good and bad experiences			0
obviously , if you were to tell me that it would happen again , i would n't greet the news with overwhelming joy and happiness			0
but i would n't look for ways to avoid it			0
' he eventually came out the other side of his depression and went to @entity169 to study law			0
now he 's decided to speak out about the past to help other young people who are cyber-bullied			0
you ’ll get through it , ' @entity6 assures , ' and you ’re not alone			2
you are surrounded by people who love you			0
