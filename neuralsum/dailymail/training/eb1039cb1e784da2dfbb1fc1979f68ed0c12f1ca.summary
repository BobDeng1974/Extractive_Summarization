the star bought her first home in @entity52 in 2012 and told how she had hankered to live in the building since she was a teenager , saying : ' i used to walk my dog by this apartment building in high school			1
i was always getting in trouble for my dog peeing in the courtyard , which is technically illegal			0
i ’m like , ‘ someday , i ’m going to live in that building ! ’ ' after girls took off , @entity60 reported that ' she moved in with a sense of private triumph			1
' however , in an interview with the fashion bible in january , she said she would soon be moving out with @entity68			2

although @entity0 has been away , @entity68 , 30 - who is working on his new solo project @entity75 - was seen arriving home on friday with pals			2
@entity79 : @entity7 says he 's ready for kids - and the sprawling home he shares with @entity0 is more than big enough for a baby the pair have said they are real homebodies , and @entity68 recently compared their relationship to that of a staid old couple			1
' one time we were at a dinner party where everyone was over 60 and before we knew it we realized everyone at the table had gone outside to smoke pot and they did n’t invite us			0
that basically says it all , ' he told @entity100			0
the couple hit it off after going on a blind date two years ago , but @entity0 insists they wo n’t tie the knot until same - sex marriage is legal across @entity107			2
but turning one of their spare bedrooms into a nursery could be on the cards soon			0

right - wing website @entity174 excerpted a portion from the book about her childhood curiosity with the female reproductive system and labelled it ' unsettling ' and ' disturbing '			1
the passage that @entity174 excerpted details a conversation that then - year - old @entity0 had with her mother , famed artist @entity183 , about women 's organs			2

' right - wing website @entity206 described the incident as ' unsettling ' and ' disturbing ' in an article titled ' @entity0 describes sexually abusing her little sister '			0
