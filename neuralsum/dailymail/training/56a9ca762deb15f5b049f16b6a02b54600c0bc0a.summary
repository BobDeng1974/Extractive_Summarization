' do we have the enforcement ? ' he was reported to have said yesterday			0
' it is very easy to say that if you ca n't enforce it , it 's like saying if you ca n't prevent rape , you enjoy it			2
' mr @entity6 , pictured with @entity2 prime minister @entity42 , was accused of trivialising rape his remark was translated in a number of slightly different ways , including as : ' if you ca n't prevent rape , you might as well enjoy it			1
' the analogy provoked outrage among opposition politicans and women 's groups who accused him of ' trivialising rape '			1

he should be prosecuted for degrading and insulting women			0
' mr @entity6 apologised today in a statement and said his comments had been taken out of context			2
' i regret any hurt caused , ' he said			0

i reiterate my deep sense of regard and respect for women and my commitment for gender issues			0
