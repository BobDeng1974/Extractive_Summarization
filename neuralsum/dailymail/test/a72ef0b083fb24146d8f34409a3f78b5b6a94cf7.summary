as any parent will know , children 's feet will often grow faster than it is possible to buy them new shoes to keep them shod			1
however , one charity has come up with an innovative new type of shoe that grows with a child 's feet			2
the shoe that grows uses adjustable buckles and a strap on the toe to expand by five sizes			1
@entity22 , from @entity23 , @entity24 , came up with the idea while working in @entity26 in @entity27 after seeing children running around barefoot and in shoes several sizes too small @entity22 , from @entity23 , @entity24 , came up with the idea while working in @entity26 in @entity27 after seeing children running around barefoot and in shoes several sizes too small			1
he said : ' it got me asking questions and finally all these questions led to an idea - what if there were a shoe that could adjust and expand ? self - tying shoelaces could become a reality after engineers designed a shoe that can automatically lace up , adjusting itself to the shape of your foot			1
pressure sensors in the shoe tell it when your foot is in position , triggering a tiny motor in the heel that pulls the laces tight			2
when you want to take off the shoes , click your heels together twice and the motor will release a spring in the shoe ’s tongue , loosening the laces so the footwear can be slipped off			2
the ingenious invention even runs on power generated by the swing of your foot as you walk			0
' what if we had a pair of shoes where they could just adjust their shoes any time their feet grow			0
' that way they will always have a pair of shoes that always fit			0
' i really feel that we have created something incredible			0
' children 's feet grow incredibly quickly with those aged between two and six years old going up a size almost every few months			1
for those living in the wealthy developed countries , this can be a burden on their parent 's wallets			0
however , for those living in developing countries where buying new shoes every few months is not an option , the risk of running around barefoot can be severe			1
children can cut their feet and get infections while they can also pick up parasites like worms through their skin			0
the shoe that grows , which resembles a typical sandal , has a tough compressed rubber sole to protect the wearer 's feet , with a soft leather upper			0
the shoe can expand five sizes by adjusting the straps at the front and back and the poppers on the sides ( pictured )			2
it currently comes in two different size ranges - small and large and a single pair costs $ 30 ( £ 20 ) but buying 100 pairs reduces the cost to $ 12 ( £ 8 ) the shoe has a tough rubber sole and a leather upper that is designed to last five years , the maker say			1
poppers on the side allow the width to be adjusted as the child 's feet expand while a strap on the toe can be moved to make the shoe @entity129 buckle on the back also can be ajusted to help make the shoes fit better poppers on the size allow the width to be adjusted as the child 's feet expand while a strap on the toe can be moved to make the shoe longer			1
a buckle on the back also can be adjusted to help make the shoes fit better			0
mr @entity22 said the shoes were designed to grow five sizes and last five years			1

mr @entity22 is working with an organisation called because international which aims to send the shoes to orphanages in @entity159			1

mr @entity22 had been working with 140 @entity176 orphans at the @entity177 in @entity26 , @entity27 , when he had the idea for the shoe			1
he said : ' i 'll never forget it			0
one day i was walking down a road with a group of kids from an orphanage where i was staying			0
' next to me there was a girl in a white dress			0
as i looked down her shoes were so small and as i looked around there were so many other kids with shoes that were too small for them			0

@entity195 uses adjustable buckles and a strap on the toe to expand in size
@entity22 dreamt up the shoe after seeing children in @entity27 barefoot
he hopes the shoes will help children in orphanages in *poorer* countries
