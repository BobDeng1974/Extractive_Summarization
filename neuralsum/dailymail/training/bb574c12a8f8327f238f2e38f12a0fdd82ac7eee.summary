@entity7 , 38 , had been told yesterday that the @entity8 in @entity9 was ready to overturn her conviction for murder			1
but that left judges with a problem - because @entity7 had also been given a seven year prison sentence for trying to cover up the murder , a charge which included the words ' being conscious of your guilt			0
' @entity7 ( right ) , 38 , has had her conviction for murdering her toddler son @entity21 ( left ) quashed by appeal judges authorities said the @entity21 's body was mummified when it was discovered in march 2010 when he would have been 23 months old the legal conundrum was solved today when defence @entity27 @entity26 asked permission to lodge a late appeal against the charge of attempting to defeat the ends of justice			1
advocate depute @entity34 replied : ' @entity35 does not oppose receipt of an additional ground of appeal in relation to charge two and does not seek to resist the ground of appeal			0
' judge @entity42 said this was ' a proper exercise of your discretion			0
' he then told @entity7 that in the circumstances the cover - up charge was also quashed , as well as the murder charge			1
a trial at the @entity52 in @entity53 at the end of 2011 heard how the mummified body of little @entity56 was found in a squalid flat in @entity58			2
the tragic tot should have been celebrating his fifth birthday yesterday ( @entity61 ) as his mum returned to court			0
squalor in the flat in @entity58 , @entity66 , where @entity7 lived with her son , @entity21 @entity7 's trial heard the toddler was left on his own in wet and dirty nappies at his home while his mother went out drinking with friends or stayed at her boyfriend 's house for days at a time the six - week trial at the end of 2011 heard how @entity7 had kept family , neighbours and social services at arms ' length , not allowing them to get close to the little boy by the time doctors were able to examine the tot , it was impossible to tell how he died			1
@entity7 was found guilty , by majority , of wilfully ill - treating and neglecting him , failing to provide him with food and drink and failing to seek medical attention			0
the charge alleged that @entity7 had ' by other means to the prosecutor unknown , caused unnecessary suffering and injury to the health of said @entity56 , whereby he died and you did murder him			0
' ' the court has come to the conclusion that the conviction of the @entity104 ( @entity7 ) of the murder of her baby son , @entity21 ... must be quashed			1
' @entity42 @entity7 came to the @entity8 in january seeking to overturn the conviction which earned her a minimum sentence of 15 years			2
@entity109 argued that crucial evidence heard by the jury was flawed			0
the lawyer questioned the claims expert witnesses called by the @entity35 who said that tell - tale marks on his bones were signs of malnutrition			0
the murder charge alleged that heroin addict @entity7 had abandoned her son for long periods of time without food or drink while she partied , drank and took drugs			2
the jury heard how @entity7 partied and took drugs while her son lay dead in his cot			2
she even sold his clothes and toys to buy heroin			0
they rejected @entity7 's claim that she had woken one morning to find @entity21 dead in his cot and had not reported the tragedy because , as mr @entity26 explained : ' she simply went into a downward spiral			1
' by the time tragic @entity56 's decomposing body was found in march 2010 - just before his second birthday - he had not been seen alive for eight months			1
a six week trial also heard how @entity7 had kept family , neighbours and social services at arm 's length - not allowing them to get close to the little boy			1
the jury were shown photos of rubbish , dirty clothes and nappies littering the squalid flat			0
today , @entity7 remained motionless as @entity42 , sitting with @entity153 of @entity154 and @entity155 quashed her convictions			1
as she was led back to the cells under the court room she began to sob			0
@entity7 is expected to be released later today .			2
