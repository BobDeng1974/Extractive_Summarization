by @entity0 and @entity1 after reliving september 11 , 2001 all over again at the newly - opened @entity3 , visitors can purchase stuffed animals , glass ornaments , @entity7 - printed ties and other tasteless souvenirs at the gift shop , located just a few feet away from the final resting place of 8,000 unidentified remains of victims from the tragedy			1
and of the 140 tacky trinkets available on the store 's website so the museum can cash in remotely , just 7.8 per cent are listed as being made in the @entity18			1
the @entity20 museum and corresponding gift shop have only been open to survivors and victims ' families since thursday , and so far these visitors have expressed outrage at souvenirs being marketed off the worst terrorist atrocity in @entity18 history			1
angered : many 9/11 survivors and victims are upset that a gift shop is part of the new museum and memorial at the @entity37 site accessories : the store offers a range of gifts like @entity44 men 's ties with the @entity7 columns design and scarves in the same print something for @entity48 : the store even stocks gifts for the family dog , such as these police and firefighter vests in every size fashion statements : women 's scarves sport prints of the old @entity61 skyline before the attacks , and a vintage print of the @entity7 during lunch hour souvenir : many of the items for sale come with a print of the @entity7 columns , such as this decorative tray according to the museum 's website , the proceeds benefit ' developing and sustaining ' the memorial which is run by executives with privately - funded six - figure salaries			1
there are many more trinkets available for sale in the actual store , so the amount of @entity18 - made items may be much less , but the museum has yet to respond to @entity86 's request for a full list of products , and their place of manufacture			1
the idea of a gift shop alone is offensive to many , but is made even more painful considering 8,000 unidentified remains of victims were recently moved to a tomb beneath the museum			1
