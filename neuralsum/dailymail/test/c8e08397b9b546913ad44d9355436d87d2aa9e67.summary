@entity0 is in it to win it — but it would be a ‘ disaster for everyone ’ if he limps out of the masters this week			1
that is the view of @entity8 after @entity0 confirmed his return to competitive golf for the first time since early february , when he withdrew with a back injury in the first round of the @entity14			1
having plummeted to 104 in the world rankings and with no kind of competitive action under his belt , beyond the rounds he has amassed in practice in @entity24 and at @entity25 during the past few days , his form is a mystery			1
former world no 1 @entity0 confirmed earlier this week that he will play at the masters @entity29 has dropped out of the world 's top 100 for the first time in almost 19 years watch live coverage of all four days of the masters only on @entity35 ( from 7pm ) and from friday on @entity36 ( 7pm )			1
but @entity8 , who will be at the masters in @entity25 commentating for @entity35 , the only place to watch all four days live , said : ‘ he has n’t entered to make up the numbers , i can guarantee that			2
imagine @entity0 coming here to the masters and scoring 69 or 68 in the first day ? suddenly the whole place is alive			2
‘ if @entity46 starts with a 69 , 68 , so does @entity0 , marvellous			2
‘ it would be fantastic , it would be a buzz around the place , some sort of electricity that we have missed without him			0
‘ whether he can win again , who knows ? hey , never mind a major , can he win another event ever again ? but let ’s hope that it ’s not one of these 75 , 76 , i ’ve hurt my back , and goes home			0
that would be a disaster for everybody			0
’ @entity0 has won the masters on four separate occasions with his last win coming in 2005 @entity8 has said it would be fantastic to see a fully fit @entity29 go up against @entity46 @entity46 can match @entity29 in winning the grand slam if he wins the masters			1
but 51 - year - old @entity8 believes the man from @entity73 will never hold the same dominance over golf that @entity0 achieved in his prime in 2000			1
he said : ‘ i do n’t think we ’ll ever see the dominance that @entity0 had in that year , ’ he said			2
‘ the golf that was played and the way that it was done , in winning majors by eight and 15 shots , it was just incredible stuff			0
‘ at this moment in time , the competition is now so severe that any lapse at all , and there is someone willing to take up that baton			0
‘ and that was n’t the case with @entity0			0
@entity0 had this dominance that @entity46 has n’t got yet			0

@entity0 has confirmed he will compete in the upcoming masters
@entity0 goes into the masters after plummeting to 104 in world rankings
@entity8 believes it is *important* for @entity29 to *impress*
