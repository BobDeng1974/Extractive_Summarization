@entity0 managed just one shot on or off target for @entity3 on sunday			1
click here for @entity6 's @entity5 ! this time last year he was earning £ 850 per week			1
now , @entity3 striker @entity0 is among the @entity10 's top goalscorers and a member of the senior @entity13 squad			1
a new deal in december 2013 saw the 21 year old with seven @entity10 goals bump his pay to £ 12,000 a week , a modest sum compared to others in lesser form at the same level			1
there is a reason @entity23 and @entity24 are loitering , and why @entity3 are scurrying to tie @entity0 down to a new contract that would double his salary at the @entity27			1
@entity0 started , having been named in @entity38 's 26 - man @entity36 squad for games against @entity40 and @entity41 next week			2
he has @entity23 's @entity42 , @entity44 's @entity43 and @entity24 's @entity45 to compete with for a place , and sunday 's match was an audition of sorts			2
@entity0 , valued at £ 25million , was regularly pushed wide for the visit of @entity34			1
the forward introduced himself with a shot from 20 yards out after being fed by @entity53			0
it called for a one - handed save from goalkeeper @entity55 to loop over the crossbar , though that would prove to be his only shot of the match			2
but there seems an instinctive partnership developing between @entity0 and @entity53			0
the two complement each other and work in tandem , even if it proved ineffective on sunday			0
@entity0 was offered little space and struggled to muster a chance he could call his own while on the wing , and his heat map suggests the striker found it difficult to become involved			2
in the end , the youth product could not add to his seven @entity10 goals , and will have to wait until after the international break to add to that tally against @entity76 at @entity77			1
but there 's no doubting @entity0 's ambitions			0
' my aim would be to play in the @entity83 , to be involved in the @entity13 seniors and go and play in @entity85 , ' he admits			0
@entity0 received his first senior @entity13 call - up from @entity38 this week ahead of international break @entity0 's heat map shows a frustrating day for the striker			2
click here for our @entity5 service ! born : @entity93 , august 4 1993 ( age 21 ) 2004 - 2011 : @entity3 ( youth ) 2011 - now : @entity3 ( 43 lg apps , 13 gls ) 2011 - 2012 : @entity99 ( loan ) ( 14 , 6 ) 2012 - 2012 : @entity101 ( loan ) ( 8 , 4 ) 2012 - 2012 : @entity103 ( loan ) ( 10 , 2 ) one of those was ticked off by @entity38 this week , and his senior debut awaits			1
the rest will have to wait , most likely until he leaves the @entity27 for a club that can offer @entity110 football			0
but @entity3 manager @entity28 has a word of advice for the striker , having seen the pitfalls that younger players can fall into			1
' if you keep on going about your job in that way , keep living life as you have been , then things will happen , ' @entity28 says			0
' @entity0 has the potential to be a top player			0
' but like every young player , he needs to make sure he keeps his focus and does n't get distracted outside the training ground and the pitch			0
' the stage is set for the potential @entity13 star			0
whether he takes it is up to him			0
@entity3 manager @entity28 has a word of advice for the striker who has been valued at £ 25million			1
