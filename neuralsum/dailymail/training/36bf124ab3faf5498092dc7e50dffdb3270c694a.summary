it ’s the moment every parent dreads – soothing a child who 's had his heart broken			0
but this little boy 's heartbreak happens in the worst possible way when he hears the news ... from his own mother ! chatting to the boy during their drive in the car , mum starts a conversation that soon balloons into a full - blown histrionic affair , complete with dramatic sobs , distraught weeping and angry tears			1
this four - year - old gets his heart broken when his mother tells him that his playschool pal @entity22 has made friends with other boys at first he is bewildered and does n't seem to understand when she tells him that his friend @entity22 likes a boy who called her			1
the boy opens his mouth wide and starts wailing : ' i do n’t like that			0
' gasping between his sobs , he wails : ‘ it hurts my feelings … i thought her [ sic ] was my friend but now her [ sic ] does n't like me anymore			1
’ his words eaten up by more sobs , the child is unable to complete his sentence			2
the highly amusing conversation slowly spirals out of control as the mother tries to calm her child , who becomes more and more inconsolable as the conversation continues strapped into his child seat , the four - year - old wails in consternation ( left ) when he discovers that his friend @entity22 has decided to see other people mum does her best to reassure him but his wails grow louder and more distraught as he realises that @entity22 is not solely his friend			1
she reminds him that he likes other people , saying : ‘ you know how you have so many friends at school ? ’ she then tells him that @entity22 can have lots of friends as well , but the boy is not having any of it			2
‘ but i do n’t like it if she does n't call me anymore , ’ he yells , getting to the crux of his problems			0
‘ well then you call her , the mother suggests			0
‘ but i do n’t know how to call her , ’ he shouts , frustrated that his mother does n't understand his problems			0
‘ first i was her best friend but now the other boy will be her best friend , ’ yells the little boy , who does n't want his friend @entity22 to be pally with anyone else other than him ‘ i just want her to like me more better ’ he says			1
‘ first i was her best friend but now the other boy will be her best friend			0
’ @entity49 tries to convince him that @entity22 can have lots of friends but his backseat crying continues , and even the reminder that he has lots of friends does nothing to ease the child ’s woes			1
‘ i want to call her right now , ’ he says , clearly a man of action			0
but his plans to get his plan to get the friendship back on are thwarted when mum tells him that he can only get in touch with @entity22 later			2
he tearfully agrees with the suggestion , but not without articulating his feelings one last time , yelling : ‘ i do n’t feel good because of @entity22 , ’ heart - wrenchingly .			2

wails in agony when mum breaks news that @entity22 is talking to another child
' it hurts my feelings , ' he cries loudly , clearly distraught with the *situation*
his mother tries to console him but he does n't accept her comforting words
