a concept for the ‘ concorde of the tunnelling world ’ has been revealed			0
and if it ever becomes a reality , it could make high speed train travel from the @entity6 to the @entity7 a reality			0
the idea for the transport system of the future , was proposed in a competition run by think tank in a bid to boost business between @entity16 and @entity17			1
the future ? a concept for a transatlantic train in a vacuum tunnel ( illustrated ) dubbed the ‘ concorde of the tunnelling world , ’ has been proposed in a competition the proposal , which was seen by @entity25 , claims that technological advantages could make the dream of a transatlantic train journey a reality and transform the economy in the north of @entity32			1
the train would be contained within a tube underneath the @entity35 , with a service running in a perfect vacuum			1
‘ the train is levitated in mid-air using electric magnets , ’ said @entity38 , a young professional who submitted the idea with several colleagues			2
the proposal claims that a transatlantic train journey would transform the economy in the north of @entity32 , together with the region 's own ' @entity47 ' ( pictured ) which would connect city airports ‘ this reduces nearly all causes of friction and drag , enabling both huge speeds and a completely smooth ( and silent ) journey			1
’ based on calculations by entrepreneur @entity57 , who came up with the idea of a train that travels inside a vacuum tube , a journey between @entity16 and @entity17 could take just four hours , if a maximum speed of 800mph ( 1,287kph ) was achievable			1
@entity63 , another competition entrant under the age of 25 , proposed a ' northern hyperloop , ' which has much in common with @entity57 ’s designs for a @entity47 vacuum train , only instead of connecting @entity69 and @entity70 , the northern @entity32 version would link airports to a ‘ superhub ’			1
inside the tubes of @entity57 's design , @entity47 , pods are mounted on thin skis made out of inconel , an alloy already used by his @entity81 firm that can withstand high pressure and heat			1
@entity84 is pumped into the skis via small holes to make an air cushion , and each pod has air inlets at the front			0
an electric turbo compressor compresses air from the nose and routes it to the skis and to the cabin			0
magnets on the skis , plus an electromagnetic pulse give the pod its initial thrust ; reboosting motors along the route would keep the pod moving at just below the speed of sound so the system does not produce sonic booms			0
under the plans , individual airports would act as terminals within a single rapidly connected local , national and international rail and air network			0
the @entity32 design also builds on mr @entity57 ’s vacuum tunnel concept by adding a propeller to the front of the train to force any remaining air resistance back			1
cities such as @entity16 could also see other futuristic changes to their transport systems			2
sections of the road could be replaced by solar panels to generate power for the national grid , according to a group of students , or electricity could be generated by energy - capturing technology to convert noise energy to electricity intended to power electric cars , for example			1
in another futuristic vision , the region ’s roads would be equipped with wind - capturing technology , which would convert wind energy to electricity , made available to electric car drivers via vehicles charging points			2
the transport system would reap benefits including a reduced reliance on fossil fuels and greater availability of renewable energy , the think tank said			0
under the plans , individual airports would act as terminals within a single rapidly connected local , national and international rail and air network			0
a train could run from @entity16 ( pictured left ) to @entity17 ( right ) the design has much in common with @entity57 ’s plans for a vacuum train called the @entity47 ( illustrated ) , only instead of connecting @entity69 and @entity70 , the northern @entity32 version would link airports to a ‘ superhub ’ a 15 - year plan called @entity160 , submitted on behalf of the cities of @entity162 , @entity16 , @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165 already features an interconnected transport system across air , roads , ports and rail , including the high - speed east – west rail route dubbed @entity173			1
it also includes a potential new tunnel through the @entity176 to increase rail capacity			0
environmentally - friendly developments feature heavily in future plans with ideas for ‘ green cities ’ , a carbon free north and even the creation of a @entity184			1
the park would span the @entity186 and @entity187 to include the @entity176 range , attracting tourism and jobs by playing on the heightened ‘ status ’			0
it is the brainchild of professor @entity193 , who believes parts of the moors should be considered potential @entity196 arguing they are ‘ particularly rich in industrial archaeology ’			0
‘ some of these moors were the birthplace of a system of “ proto - industrialism ” which lit the fuse for the industrial revolution in @entity16 and @entity205 , ’ he said			2
the proposal , which was seen by @entity25 , claims that technological advantages could make the dream of a transatlantic train journey a reality , between @entity16 and @entity17 ( both marked on the map ) one day , sections of road could be replaced by solar panels ( illustrated with a concept image ) to generate power for the national grid , or electricity could be generated by energy - capturing technology to convert noise energy to electricity intended to power electric cars , for example billionaire inventor @entity57 has revealed he plans to build a test track for @entity47 - a futuristic type of transport that would shoot capsules of passengers along a tube at around the speed of sound			1
mr @entity57 claims his solar - powered ' hyperloop ' could herald a revolution in travel - and is building the test facility to prove it			1
he believes it would take just 30 minutes to travel the 381 miles ( 613km ) from @entity69 to @entity70 – half the time it takes in a plane – and likened the passenger experience to @entity239 's rocket ride @entity240			0
@entity57 's @entity47 ( an conceptual image is shown ) could take just 30 minutes to travel the 381 miles ( 613 km ) from @entity69 to @entity70 – half the time it takes in a plane			1
he has likened the passenger experience to @entity239 's rocket ride @entity240 now , the plans are beginning to take shape			0
mr @entity57 tweeted : ' will be building a @entity47 test track for companies and student teams to test out their pods			1
' a new firm , @entity251 , is developing plans to makes the tubes a reality - and it has recruited experts from around the world			0
the crowdsourced firm has around 100 engineers on the projects , and nearly all of them have day jobs at companies like @entity263 , @entity264 , @entity265 , @entity266 , @entity81 , and @entity267			0
mr @entity57 's idea is based on the pneumatic tubes that fire capsules of paperwork between floors in offices			1
in this case , the capsules would carry people – even cars – in low - pressure tubes to minimise turbulence and maximise speed			0
on top of pylons is a hovering capsule inside a low - pressurized tube , which can reach speeds of up to 760 mph			2
' the only resistance would be the air in front of the capsule , which we moved to the back by using a compressor , ' @entity47 ceo @entity286 said			2
at its launch , @entity57 described the @entity47 design as looking like a shotgun , with the tubes running side - by - side for most of the journey , then closing at either end to form a loop			1
trains of capsules would shoot through the almost air - free tube at up to 760mph ( 1,223kph ) , accelerated by magnets which would also keep each pod on a steady course			2
each capsule would float on a cushion of air it creates as it speeds along – similar to an air hockey table			0
while trains travelling through vacuum tubes could one day connect major @entity7 cities ( illustrated ) , for now , a test track will be uilt to test the idea - most likely in @entity250 , according to a tweet capsules carrying six to eight people would depart every 30 seconds , with tickets costing around £ 13 ( $ 20 ) each way			1
in his proposal released online , @entity57 wrote : ' short of figuring out real teleportation , which would of course be awesome ( someone please do this ) , the only option for super-fast travel is to build a tube over or under the ground that contains a special environment			2
' the proposed route of the first @entity47 follows @entity333 , which runs through the agriculture - rich @entity334 in @entity336			2
it would take seven to ten years to build			0
@entity57 put the price tag at around £ 4billion ( $ 2.6billion ) .			0

the transatlantic train idea was one of the ideas were proposed in a competition run by @entity16 - based think tank , @entity25
the train would run between the northern @entity32 city and @entity17
the train would be contained within a tube underneath the @entity35 , with a service running in a perfect vacuum , like @entity57 's idea
a northern @entity32 version of his ' @entity47 ' has been proposed to connect airports and cities in the north of the country
roads made from solar panels are among other technologies suggested
