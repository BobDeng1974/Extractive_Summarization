by @entity0 published : 19:58 est , 3 april 2013 updated : 07:53 est , 4 april 2013 research by the children 's watchdog found that 100 per cent of 14 - year - old boys in one school had watched pornography pornography is so pervasive that entire classes of young teenage boys have watched it , the deputy children ’s commissioner has warned			1
@entity13 said access to pornography among children was so easy it should trigger ' moral panic ' among parents , teachers and ministers			1
she quoted unpublished research into access to pornography among children which found it is much more widespread than previously thought			1
it showed that every boy and half the girls in a year nine group of 14 - year - olds had accessed pornography in one school in @entity34			0
miss @entity13 said she had evidence that children as young as 11 had been found actively to be ' seeking out pornography '			2
some boys now felt they had an ' absolute entitlement to have sex with girls , any time , any place , anywhere , with whomsoever they wished '			1
the watchdog was so concerned that it had commissioned more research to see if boys actually understood what ‘ giving consent ’ to sex actually meant			1
on tuesday , the @entity49 revealed that 15 children a day are excluded from schools for sexual misconduct			2
this paper has been campaigning for tough restrictions on web porn to protect youngsters , following fears it is warping children ’s views of sex and relationships			1
@entity63 has promised new protections whereby all new computers will be automatically fitted with web filters unless parents specifically lift them			0
but no timetable has yet been put in place to implement the scheme			0
miss @entity13 made her comments on @entity72 ’s @entity73 , which is examining ' parenting and pornography '			1
she said : ' we came across one study where they were looking at the whole cohort of year nine pupils within a large local authority in @entity34			0
' the findings were that 100 per cent of 14 - year - olds is accessing pornography			0
and about 50 per cent of the girls			0
' the girls did not want to look at the porn – they were being made to by the boys			2
' conservative mp @entity90 told the @entity92 programme that parents should tell other parents about the problems of children watching pornography ' we have commissioned research into young people ’s understanding of consent ... it raises very serious questions about whether boys in particular have any understanding of the concept of consent			1
' miss @entity13 said : ' no one should be panicking , but why should there not be a moral panic ? ' because what we are uncovering is the scale of what this is doing to children and young people ’s sense of what is reasonable			2
' if that does not generate some huge moral anxiety amongst us as a responsible population , government and community then quite frankly i would be very worried			0
' @entity90 , @entity63 ’s adviser on childhood , told the programme the problem of children accessing sex websites should be treated like a ' public health issue ' such as nits by parents			1
parents should contact others , saying ' my child has seen porn , he may have sent it round his classmates , please can we all get together and talk about it ' , she said			0
miss @entity90 said : ' one of the worst things is that parents are so shocked and ashamed that they find it difficult to talk to their children , let alone the other parents			0
' she said that it was up to parents to take back control of the internet , adding : ' if your children said , " actually mum i want to go and drive the car " , or “ i would just like to eat crisps and chocolate for every meal ” , we would feel we had some level of responsibility or some ability to control those decisions			0
