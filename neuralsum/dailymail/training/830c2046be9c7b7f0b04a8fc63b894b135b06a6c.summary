the crew lay exhausted on the pontoon at @entity9 after winning silver in a thrilling race yesterday			1
after being pipped to the gold by a quarter of a second , @entity12 was too weak to get back in the boat and row up to the podium with his crew mates			2
instead he had to walk over , supported by race workers			2
exhausted : @entity12 after the @entity21 men 's lightweight four threw all their energy into winning silver spent : the crew drained themselves of so much energy in their rowing final they literally had to be helped from their boat @entity33 , 27 , and his brother @entity32 , 22 , from @entity34 , @entity12 , 28 , from @entity35 , and @entity36 , 27 , from @entity37 , @entity38 , looked emotional as they stood side - by - side with their medals around their necks			1
@entity12 said : ‘ i do n’t remember that much of the last 250m to be honest			2
we were so determined to come away with a medal and get to the podium that you will literally do anything to get there			2
the pain is so extreme			2
’ @entity33 , who was met at the finish line by wife @entity51 , 26 , and nine - month - old baby @entity52 , said : ‘ we were in absolute agony			1
we had a fight to the death			2
’ the race caused controversy when a row broke out over whether the men were given a lane which exposed them to the wind , preventing them from beating winners @entity63			1
however , @entity36 – who learnt to row at nearby @entity65 – said : ‘ you ca n’t be upset when you ’ve got a silver medal in the @entity68 with 30,000 brits cheering you on			2

at 750 metres , they held a length lead with @entity3 trailing in fifth , behind @entity63 and @entity106			1
but there was plenty in reserve and with every stroke in the second half of the race , @entity3 gained ground on the leaders			1
eventually , @entity81 were reeled in and @entity63 were left to fend off the @entity21 challenge which ultimately fell just short despite the support of a vociferous home crowd			1
the @entity63 crew of @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 could n't quite believe they 'd won at the finish			1
