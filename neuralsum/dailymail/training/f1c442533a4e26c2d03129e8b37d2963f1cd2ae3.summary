by @entity0 published : 05:58 est , 20 july 2013 updated : 11:31 est , 20 july 2013 when baby @entity2 was born struggling to breathe , doctors decided he needed immediate specialist treatment			1
he was whisked away from his parents to two different hospitals hundreds of miles away as doctors fought to save his life			0
but the family were able to be reunited closer to home after the @entity10 took @entity11 back safely to his local hospital in @entity13 in a specialist ' baby pod ' which enabled him to breathe			1
tiny @entity16 wore miniature ear defenders for his helicopter trip , which took him 170 miles from @entity19 to @entity20 , @entity21 , in just 59 minutes			1
first flight : @entity16 had tiny ear defenders strapped to his head for the helicopter journey transfer : @entity10 was called to fly @entity16 from @entity27 , where he was having life - saving treatment , to @entity29 so he could be close to his family doctors first became concerned about @entity16 's condition moments after birth when it was clear he was in severe respiratory distress and had lung tissue damage			2
he was diagnosed with acute meconium aspiration - caused when the baby breathes in its own waste products during birth - after a long two - day labour			2
paramedics immediately drove him to @entity44 where he was put on a mechanical ventilator to clear his lungs , but doctors told his mother @entity48 he was unlikely to survive the 50 - mile journey and that she should prepare for the worst			0
although @entity16 did make the journey the ventilator was not effective , so consultants at the hospital called in a specialist team from @entity54			2
the team brought the only mobile ecmo - or @entity58 oxygenation - machine in the country , which artificially pumps blood and oxygen around the body			0
safe : @entity16 was put into a specialist baby pod where he was kept attached to breathing equipment throughout the flight on the mend : @entity16 is now back home and is expected to make a full recovery with no long - term side effects they then took @entity11 to the @entity19 hospital where he spent two nights having @entity75 treatment and started responding well			1
mrs @entity76 and her husband had followed their son up the country by car , but as travelling was difficult after her problematic labour , she was thrilled to learn @entity16 would be returning home to @entity21			1
the baby was stabilised in the @entity10 baby pod before being flown by pilots @entity86 and @entity87 back to @entity13 , while his parents took the five - hour journey by road			1
growing strong : @entity16 is now back home with mother @entity76 where he is using an oxygen tube to help his lungs recover mrs @entity76 said it was incredibly hard to put her baby in the hands of the helicopter crew , but she was reassured when they let her on board to take pictures before they took off , and because they called her regularly to let her know how it was going			2
she said : ' i knew he was in the best hands and it was the best parting from @entity16 i could have had			0
' after three weeks ' further treatment in the @entity21 hospital , @entity16 is back home and doing well , although he is still on oxygen			1
he is expected to make a full recovery with no long - term side effects			2
mrs @entity76 now plans to run a half marathon next year to raise money for the @entity10 as a thank - you			0
she said : ' @entity10 provides an amazing service and we are so grateful that they were there to help @entity16 when he needed them most			0
' @entity10 is the only helicopter ambulance service in @entity121 and @entity122 solely dedicated to transferring critically ill children and babies to specialist hospitals and is fitted with paediatric equipment			0
the charity , which is entirely funded by public donations , got its first helicopter in october 2012			0
the helicopter is an @entity131 which can reach speeds of up to 200mph			0
nearly two thirds of the children which are helped by the air ambulance are under three months old .			1
