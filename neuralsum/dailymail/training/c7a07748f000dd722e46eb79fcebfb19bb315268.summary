by @entity0 published : 10:58 est , 23 april 2013 updated : 15:19 est , 23 april 2013 the @entity2 bombings could be a ' gift ' to @entity4 in the @entity7 president 's quest to enlist the @entity8 as an ally in his fight against the @entity11 , according to a prominent opposition leader			1
@entity13 , who was deputy prime minister of @entity11 's breakaway government in the 1990s , insists that @entity16 culture is ' not responsible ' for the atrocity at last monday 's marathon apparently carried out by @entity16 brothers @entity20 and @entity21			1
and he also suggests that the @entity7 government will use the tragedy as an excuse to impose further controls on the @entity26			1
after the @entity38 which led to @entity39 re-imposing central control on the territory , he was forced into exile and is now living in @entity43 , where he remains a fierce critic of mr @entity4			0
he told the @entity45 that the revelation that the main suspects in the @entity32 attack which left three dead and more than 170 injured was ' a gift to the @entity50 and @entity4 '			1
the @entity7 government has long sought to link its campaigns in @entity52 - majority @entity11 with the global war against @entity55 terror , and mr @entity13 predicted that @entity2 would make this link seem more natural			1
' they will say , " this is the @entity16 , " ' he said			0
suspects : @entity60 , left , and his brother @entity61 , right , are accused of carrying out the atrocity this prediction seems to be coming true already , as a number of senior @entity7 have pointed to the bombings as proof that the @entity11 have always posed a threat to the rest			1
' there is a sense of frustration that the @entity74 intelligence services have not been fully co-operative with the @entity7 intelligence services , ' former @entity50 adviser @entity69 told the @entity76 yesterday			2
' these people who are waging the terrorist threat in @entity11 and beyond are dangerous to everyone , and not just to @entity7			2
' military adviser @entity80 used the crisis as an opportunity to warn against allowing exiles from the @entity26 into @entity74 countries as asylum seekers			0
' the question we should ask @entity88 is why are they not co-operating as much as the @entity7 secret services want them to on matters of terrorism , ' he said			0
bomb : the moment the explosives went off at the @entity32 's finish line last monday mr @entity80 added that @entity43 had ' created a ticking time - bomb ' by welcoming exiled @entity11 such as mr @entity13			1
many @entity88 commentators have also argued that the @entity88 must build stronger intelligence - sharing ties with @entity7 in the wake of the attack			2
the @entity7 reaction to the news of the @entity106 ' identity was so swift that mr @entity13 even suggested that the @entity39 government could have had a hand in the attack in order to discredit @entity16 separatists			1
' which @entity16 military group trained this guy ? nobody trained this guy , ' he said			0
' i could believe if they come to @entity39 that they have some instruction from someone , from @entity7 special services			0
' there is no evidence of @entity7 state involvement in the @entity2 atrocity , but many believe the @entity50 was responsible for the 1999 apartment bombings which killed 293 and led to the start of the @entity38			2
conflict : @entity7 soldiers patrolling @entity61 in @entity11 during the @entity38 in 2000 the alleged @entity2 terrorists are of @entity16 ancestry , but grew up in the independent country of @entity133 before moving to @entity134 , which borders @entity11			1
they moved to the @entity88 in 2002 , settling in @entity135 - and mr @entity13 pointed to the brothers ' @entity88 upbringing as evidence that @entity11 bears no blame for the atrocity			0
' @entity11 and the @entity16 nation are not responsible what two crazy guys committed in the @entity88 , ' he said			2
' we always condemn any terrorist actions			0
these are not the methods to reach our political goal			0
' he concluded : ' do n't try to link this tragic crime in @entity2 to the @entity16 nation			0
