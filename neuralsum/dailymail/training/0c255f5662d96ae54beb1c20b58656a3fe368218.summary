the former prime minister is set to be summoned by the @entity12 select committee to explain the controversial ' comfort letters ' sent to on - the - run suspects telling them they were not being sought by the police			1
@entity16 are warning that if he fails to appear there will be ' bad publicity '			1
the policy led to the collapse of the trial of suspected @entity24 bomber @entity23 in march			0
the peace process plan agreed between @entity7 and mr @entity0 's @entity27 government saw around 200 letters of assurance sent to on - the - runs telling them they were not wanted by @entity31 authorities			1
the letters did not rule out future prosecutions if new evidence emerged			0
the @entity12 committee is investigating the deal after the collapse of the case against @entity39 , who was accused of the 1982 ira @entity24 bombing which killed four soldiers			1
in may last year mr @entity39 was arrested at @entity42 and charged with killing squadron quartermaster corporal @entity43 , lieutenant @entity44 , trooper @entity45 and lance corporal @entity46			2
seven horses were also killed in the attack as the soldiers travelled from their barracks to @entity51			2
but the case against mr @entity39 collapsed after it emerged he had received a letter clearing him to travel to the @entity31			2
the committee has taken evidence from senior police officers in @entity12 , and @entity27 politicians who served as @entity57 in the @entity27 government			1
mr @entity0 is understood to have provided written evidence to the committee , but could be called to appear in person to answer questions direct from @entity16			2
@entity5 suspect @entity39 walked free from court in march after the @entity24 bomb trial collapsed @entity65 chairman @entity64 told the @entity66 : ‘ mr @entity0 has not found a date in his diary			1
‘ we are going to have to press him			0
technically we can compel him to attend			0
‘ i do n’t want to have to get to that point yet but others on the committee will want to do that			0
‘ there is going to be bad publicity … if he does n’t come because people will draw their own conclusion			2
‘ i take the view mr @entity0 has a duty to come and explain it			0
he is right at the thick of it			0
’ mr @entity0 ’s office has previously suggested the sticking point has been finding a suitable date to fit in with his role as a @entity87 peace envoy and when the committee is sitting			1
a spokesman for mr @entity0 said : ' @entity0 has already given evidence in person to the @entity93 and has said he is happy to also give evidence to the @entity65 , we are in discussions about the best way to do that given the current demands of his @entity87 role			0
' the spokesman said they did not know anything suggestions mr @entity0 could appear via video link			0
on thursday the results of another inquiry into the affair , led by lady justice @entity106 , will be published			0
@entity106 's report is expected to address secret negotiations between mr @entity0 and @entity109 , the @entity7 president , on how to deal with " on - the - run " suspects			1
because they had not been convicted , they did not fall within the scope of the 1998 @entity116 , which saw jailed paramilitaries released early			0
for more than 30 years , @entity39 had the @entity5 bombing in @entity24 hanging over his head - and the families of four victims denied justice .			1
