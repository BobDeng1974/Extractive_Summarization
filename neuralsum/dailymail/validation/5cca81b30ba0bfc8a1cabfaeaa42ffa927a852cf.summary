@entity0 will return to @entity1 with @entity3 's warning ringing loud and clear			1
' an important few months , ' said the @entity5 boss , and that was before a frustrating night spent all - too - easily shackled by three @entity8 centre - halves			1
starved of the ball in an unfamiliar position in an even less familiar line - up it was easy to feel sympathy for @entity0 as he was hauled off after 55 minutes in @entity14			1
@entity0 struggled for @entity5 against @entity15 and was starved of the ball playing in an unfamiliar position but sympathy wo n't do him much good			1
what he needs is football and plenty of it if he is to recapture the zip , rediscover his rhythms and regain ground on those who have passed him at club and country			0
with a contract set to expire next year and @entity31 seemingly reluctant to offer him game time , even when @entity33 is running on empty , there is lots to consider			1
unlike those striking deals to be excused a half here and a game there , @entity0 reported for international duty desperate to feature			2
he added two more caps			0
he was encouraged to get the nod to come on ahead of @entity43 against @entity44 and thrilled at the chance to start against @entity15 but it was heavy going			2
@entity0 shoots at goal during @entity5 's friendly against @entity15 at the @entity48 on tuesday @entity0 was starting his first international game in 18 months having injured his cruciate ligaments @entity51 winger @entity43 came on , also out of position , and fired home @entity5 's equaliser @entity5 improved as an attacking threat after @entity57 's introduction towards the end of the first - half and pulled level as the game became disrupted by substitutions			1
to make matters worse for @entity0 , it was @entity43 who came on , also playing out of position on the left of @entity3 's midfield diamond , and fired a terrific equaliser past @entity69			1
@entity0 goes back to @entity1 to prepare for @entity70 on saturday , but when @entity31 catches up on this game , he will not see any compelling evidence to offer a recall to the first team against one of the clubs likely to show interest if he is to leave the @entity78			1
that is not a decision he has yet made			0
but it will emerge as a possibility if @entity0 can not impose himself on the end of the season			2
he has just turned 26 , he has been an @entity5 international for nearly nine years â€“ this was his 38th cap - and he needs to play regularly			1
if he is on the market , there will be demand from @entity90 clubs anxious to add to their @entity92 contingent , but he has to choose carefully			0
@entity1 may ultimately make the decision for him			2
@entity5 winger @entity0 failed to make an impact for the @entity5 as his touch map ( right ) shows in @entity14 , @entity0 was starting his first international start for 18 months , having played less than nine hours of competitive football since damaging cruciate ligaments in january last year			1
when he was injured he was playing up front in an @entity101 tie against @entity51			0
it ' s safe to assume that at that point he did not expect his next @entity5 start to be in tandem with @entity105 , who was on the @entity51 bench that day			2
their partnership is unlikely to be rekindled			0
it started badly , with a moment of miscommunication with @entity112 , his @entity1 team - mate			2
@entity0 turned and dashed away while @entity112 rolled a pass into the area he had just vacated			2
then his touch let him down			0
his touch was too poor too often , a clue to his lack of match sharpness			0
the failure of either @entity105 or @entity0 to hold up the ball contributed to an insipid start and the gentle rhythms of the first - half seemed to have sent the crowd to sleep until @entity125 stirred them with his goal			1
@entity0 dropped deeper in search of the ball			1
his touch was better when he accepted a long , wonderful right - to - left pass from @entity131 , just before @entity125 scored			0
he tried to duck onto his right foot and curl one towards the far post but his effort was blocked by @entity136			0
@entity0 , pictured against @entity15 's @entity137 , lacked match sharpness after his time on the sidelines that was his only real sniff of goal			1
another chance was smothered after a knock - down from @entity105			0
@entity5 were flat in the first - half , and less effective on the turnover than they have been			2
they never utilised @entity0 's pace in behind and so did not unleash his greatest asset , although @entity151 partly blamed the @entity1 man for making the wrong runs			1
this is one reason he will remain primarily a winger			0
he can finish and has a healthy goal rate at the time of his injury but he thrives in the open			0
he was too easily policed by the @entity8 , but so was @entity105 , the hottest striker in @entity5			0
at the start of the second - half , @entity0 switched roles with @entity131 , playing in the @entity164 position , one he is even less familiar with			0
but , 10 minutes after the break , he was replaced by @entity166 , who also made a good impression			0
the work out will do him no harm , but @entity0 is in danger of slipping down the order at @entity5 as well as @entity1			1
none of which bodes well for his chances of getting what he really needs at club or country			0
@entity105 , the @entity90 's joint - top scorer , was easily dealt with by @entity178 @entity0 was replaced by @entity166 and the @entity5 team seemed more comfortable with the @entity181 man			1

@entity0 is entering an ' important few months ' says @entity3
the @entity1 star was starved of the ball during @entity5 's match with @entity15
@entity0 did little to *persuade* @entity31 to play him against @entity70
