from vampy plum to pale pink , most women own at least a handful of lipsticks			2
but few will have considered the ingredients that give them the perfect pout			2
now , one chemistry teacher has revealed the strange components that go into lipstick , including insects , wax and even chilli			1
he says that while brands tweak their recipes , all lipsticks are made of oil , wax and pigments or dyes ( as shown above ) red lipstick ( pictured ) often includes insects and most long - lasting hues feature a chemical compound called eosin , which subtly changes colour when it is applied to the lips			1
the dye reacts with the amine groups found in proteins in the skin , which makes it long - lasting a single lipstick contains several hundred different chemical compounds to give it the desired colour , glossiness , and indelibility			1
and while ingredients will differ between brands , there are a number of essential ingredients , according to @entity49 - based teacher @entity15 who is the author of the blog , @entity50			1
the pigment used in red lipstick is often made from crushed cochineal bugs , which live on cacti			1
the colour is known as @entity56 – or carminic acid – and is prepared by boiling the insect bodies in ammonia or sodium carbonate solution			2
@entity62 beetles provide the pigmentation for red lipsticks			0
@entity65 is used in vampy deep hues and makes lipsticks long - lasting			1
titanium dioxide is added to red pigment to produce sugary pink shades			0
capsaicin - a compound found in chillies - acts a minor skin irritant so it plumps up the lips			1
carnauba wax is included in lipsticks that are less likely to melt if they are left in a hot car			0
castor oil enables lipstick to glide onto the lips and affects its glossiness			1
the mixture is then filtered before hydrated potassium aluminium sulphate is added			0
deep red lipsticks and formulas that claim to be long - lasting , often include a chemical compound called eosin			1
the dye subtly changes colour when it is applied to the lips and produces a lipstick that has a slightly blue tinge			2
the dye reacts with the amine groups found in proteins in the skin , and this reaction causes its colour to intensify to become a deeper red			2
this reaction also makes the dye longer - lasting than others			2
other pigments and dyes – which only make up five per cent of a lipstick – are used for different colours			0
titanium dioxide , which is a white compound , is a common ingredient that is added to dilute red lipsticks and make them pink			0
other compounds can be added in small quantities to make formulas more moisturising or fragrant			0
for example , capsaicin – a compound found in chillies – can act as a minor skin irritant , which causes the lips to swell slightly , plumping them up			1
waxes and oils make up the bulk of lipstick ’s composition , with waxes crucial to the structure and shape of the lipstick			0
capsaicin – a compound found in chillies ( left ) – can act as a minor skin irritant in a lipstick , which means it causes the lips to look plumper , while bees wax ( right ) is often included in a formula to bond all the chemicals together and give the product its shape @entity139 , which is composed of 300 different chemical compounds , is often used , while other natural alternatives include @entity143 wax from a @entity145 shrub and lanolin , which is a substance secreted by the glands of sheep			1
carnauba wax – obtained from the @entity151 @entity150 – makes a lipstick less likely to melt in the sun because it has the highest known melting point of any wax at 87 ˚ @entity156 as well as keeping the lipstick in shape , the waxes also bind together other ingredients and can determine its glossiness			1
oils , such as castor oil , make up around 65 per cent of any lipstick and give the cosmetic its skin - softening properties , as well as making it glide onto the lips			1
in recent years , there have been concerns about traces of heavy metals in lipsticks			0
one study by the @entity175 , found that 32 brands of lipstick contained tiny amounts of lead , aluminium , chromium and manganese , but it was based on humans ingesting the lipstick and the levels consumed were considered to be safe			2
despite this , lots of cosmetics companies are careful to make their products lead - free			0
major food companies have been accused of ' hoodwinking ' shoppers by naming them after ingredients that are n't in the packet			0
beef and @entity195 , @entity197 ’s chicken rice and @entity199 bacon - flavour bits are just some of the big brands which fake their meat content to entice consumers			0
mr @entity203 , founder of the can i eat it ? barcode scanning app and website , said : ' they ’re not breaking any rules – but there are calls for clearer labelling to stop shoppers from being caught out			0
' his study found that the bacon - style colour in @entity215 bacon - flavour bits is achieved by a little - known ingredient called carmine or @entity218 this is a red dye made from the crushed bodies of cochineal beetles , which may well be an unpalatable addition for many consumers			1
the same ingredient features in red lipsticks .			0

@entity49 - based chemistry teacher created *infographic* of lipstick ingredients that influence colour and glossiness
a single lipstick contains several hundred different chemical compounds , some of which are natural
pigment used in red lipstick is often made from crushed cochineal bugs - which are also used in food
@entity65 is used in vampy deep hues and makes lipsticks long - lasting by reacting with the skin
capsaicin – which is found in chillies – acts as a minor irritant to plump up lips
lipsticks are *largely* composed of oil and wax , which give them shape and allows them to glide *smoothly* onto the lips
