married men , is your significant other spending more and more time at work ? watch out because it could be a sign that she thinks your relationship is in trouble			2
a study found that women who fear their marriage is breaking down begin working longer hours as a ' form of insurance '			1
scientists have worked out that for every 1 per cent increase in the risk of marital breakdown , they put in an extra twelve minutes a week			1
' form of insurance ' : women who feel like their marriage is on the rocks spend longer in the office , a new study from @entity22 researchers claims but the study also found that there is no strong evidence to suggest men do the same when a relationship is struggling			1
@entity28 and his colleagues at the @entity22 used the 1996 legalisation of divorce in @entity32 to calculate how subsequent marriage breakdown rates affected women ’s participation in the workforce			1
' we see women who are at a higher risk of divorce significantly increase how much they work			1
and it is not that women working outside the home are more likely to get divorced , ' he said			1
' rather , faced with a rising probability of divorce , women work more , whether they ultimately separate or not			2
they are working as a form of insurance in case of divorce or in anticipation of it			2
divorce is harder on women			2
' in @entity32 , following the legalisation of divorce , non-religious married women increased how much they worked by about 18 per cent , compared to their churchgoing counterparts			2
religious women were used as a control group by the researchers because they were not affected by the new divorce law - their rate of separation remained constant and their divorce rate is marginal			0
still holding the family together : women ¿ s increased work outside the home was not compensated by either a decrease in domestic time spent on childcare or an increase in childrearing by father , the study also found the study using a national survey of almost 3,000 households also found women ’s increased work outside the home was not compensated by either a decrease in domestic time spent on childcare or an increase in childrearing by fathers			1
working mothers may have to juggle more tasks than their husbands , but the long - held belief that women are better than men at multitasking is a myth , according to @entity99 research			1
' on the contrary , the results of our study show that men are better at multitasking than women , ' @entity100 , a psychology professor at @entity101 , said			0
men are sometimes better than women at handling multiple tasks simultaneously , but the performance gap is correlated to the female menstrual cycle , according to his study			0
dr @entity28 , whose findings are published in the @entity116 , said : ' our results suggest women ’s changing work patterns outside of the home were not accompanied by a decrease in specialisation of tasks within the home			1
' women who have secured their outside options , in case of divorce , may have done so , at least in the short run , at the expense of their leisure time and potentially their wellbeing			0
' after the legislation was introduced non religious women were 34 per cent more likely to divorce , and religious women just 7 per cent more likely			0
dr @entity28 said it is unclear whether legalising divorce may have strengthened or weakened wives ’ bargaining position within the marriage			0
he said : ' in the short run , women may be hurt more by the higher likelihood of divorce as they are often the weaker spouse financially and would suffer more from a divorce than men			0
' in the longer run , however , they may actually adjust labour supply and strengthen outside options			0
' commenting on the findings @entity153 , one of @entity155 's leading divorce lawyers , said : ' my own experience is that both men and women tend to work longer hours when they do n't want to go home			1
' this can be to avoid a partner with whom the relationship has become strained or painful , or to avoid the stresses of child - caring after an exhausting day at work			0
' the corollary of that may be that while home life becomes less enticing , the independence of a career , and the sense of self - worth and being ones own person that working gives , becomes all the more important			0

women who fear marriage breakdown work longer as a ' form of insurance ' claims new research from the @entity22
however this increase was not matched by husbands taking more *responsibility* around the home
