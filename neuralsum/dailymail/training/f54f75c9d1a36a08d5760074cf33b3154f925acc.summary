the @entity3 ’s standard - issue blue digitized camouflage fatigues are highly flammable and will burn ‘ robustly until complete consumption , ’ a report revealed last month			1
the findings show that the digital - print camo , which is made from 50 percent cotton and 50 percent nylon , will drip as it burns , causing potentially hazardous burn injuries			2
but the @entity3 ’s top spokesman said that the government organization is aware of the report findings , and added that sailors had asked for a fade - resistant uniform that was also comfortable			2
‘ that is not a huge surprise because it ’s a 50 percent nylon uniform , ’ he said , but added that it was n’t a requirement for the military - issue uniform to be at all flame resistant			2
the impromptu test was conducted on october 15 by the @entity47 , located in @entity48 , @entity49			2
in the test , a strip of the new nylon - cotton blend uniform was exposed to a flame for 12 seconds			1
the cloth immediately lit up in flames , and continued to burn after the fire source was removed , the report said			0
according to the report , the material melts and drips as it burns , contributing to an increased risk of burn injury			0
adm. @entity29 told the @entity64 that the camouflage , known as the @entity3 ’s @entity66 , was designed with sailors in mind			0
blend : the digitized print is made from a 50/50 nylon - cotton blend that is wrinkle - resistant ashes : compared to other @entity3 uniforms , the 12 - inch strip of @entity74 fabric was totally consumed when exposed to flame he said that @entity3 workers wanted a uniform ‘ that was comfortable , that did n’t require maintenance , and would stand up under a lot of washing			1
’ the admiral added that a nylon - cotton blend was a good way of getting the type of garment these sailors wanted that would also meet their needs			1
according to the pilot , there is plenty of flame - retardant gear located throughout every @entity3 ship , meaning that the standard - issue uniforms need not be flame resistant			1
fire : while serious fires aboard aircraft carriers and other @entity3 ships are uncommon , they do happen			1
in 1967 , the @entity103 ignited after a series of explosions ; 134 sailors were killed additionally , adm. @entity29 said in a statement that ‘ the safety of our sailors , both afloat and ashore , remains a paramount concern			0
and nothing changes about the wear of the @entity116 i aboard ship or installations			0
’ an editorial in the @entity120 estimated that it could cost as much as $ 20million to gradually phase - in a fire - retardant uniform , but noted that most sailors would ‘ gladly pay an extra $ 50 per set to know that their uniforms will protect them if their ship ever catches fire			1
’ while serious fires aboard aircraft carriers and other @entity3 ships are uncommon , they do happen			1
in 1967 , the @entity103 ignited after a series of explosions			0
