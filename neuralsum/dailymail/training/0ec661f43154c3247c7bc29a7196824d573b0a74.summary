@entity0 , 33 , pictured , was jailed for two years after she admitted using homemade ' stingers ' to disable three police cars on @entity3 an eco-warrior who disabled three squad cars rushing to @entity3 call - outs with homemade ' stingers ' wanted to ' give the police a taste of their own medicine '			1
@entity0 , 33 , of no - fixed - abode , left the lumps of wood , embedded with nails across the road from @entity15 police station in @entity16			1
the homemade devices were hidden inside takeaway boxes and covered with leaves on @entity3 last			1
@entity20 heard that three police cars were damaged by the improvised devices as they responded to emergency call outs , destroying four tyres and causing £ 1,500 worth of damage			1
@entity0 , who denied she was an anarchist , later said her actions were in protest at the death of a black teenager in @entity29 , police brutality in @entity31 and cuts to legal aid			1
the carer , who admitted one charge of conspiracy to commit criminal damage being reckless as to whether life was endangered , remained emotionless as she was jailed			1
judge @entity39 , the recorder of @entity16 , said that anarchists in the city had caused £ 20 million of damage to police , commercial buildings and mobile phone providers in the past four years			1
' responsibility in relation to these incidents has been claimed by what have been described as anarchist groups , ' the judge told @entity0			1
' i must make it clear from the start that your offending can not be linked to that course of conduct , although of course this forms a backdrop to the sentencing process in this case			0
' the judge said @entity0 had been caught trying to flee the scene by police officers who spotted her acting suspiciously with another person , who has not been identified			1
sentencing her at @entity20 to two years in prison , judge @entity39 , @entity71 , told her : ' this was an attack carried out on @entity3 when the police were likely to have a high number of calls because of revelry and drunken behaviour			1
' this is particularly surprising for someone of your intelligence and behaviour			0
' you targeted police officers who act to protect members of the public			2
' this must be a demonstration to others that behaviour like this will be met with custodial sentences			0
' actions carried out as part of a campaign of deception will be met by very serious punishment			0
the judge added : ' you have told the probation service that when you carried out this offence you had in mind a very well covered case in @entity29 of the police reaction to a black man			1
' you said you had in mind police brutality in @entity31 and your own experiences with police at protests you had attended			2
' what you have failed to take into account is who it is who it is that is there to protect the people who suffer from domestic abuse			0
' the people who are there for the victims of serious violence , the people who arrive at emergency road collisions			2
officers called colleagues for back - up and the three police cars accelerated out of the police station at @entity147 , a building on an industrial estate			1
the first driver passed over the debris but suffered a slow puncture and lost control of the vehicle as he approached a nearby dual carriageway , the court heard			2
the second car immediately suffered two punctured tyres and had to stop , while the third vehicle had one of its tyres punctured by the stinger despite trying to avoid it			2
' the devices which had been secreted under the debris were a number of handmade stingers , fashioned from blocks of wood , ' the judge said			2
' each contained five large , prominent nails			0
' @entity0 was arrested and taken to @entity174 station where officers found takeaway containers , a plastic bag and leaves in her pocket			1
the judge said he had received numerous glowing testimonies on behalf of @entity0 , describing her as compassionate and passionate about justice and equality			1
' your dislike of the police generally in my judgment is peculiar for someone of your intelligence and sophistication			2
' it is strange for someone with your compassion to take steps to endanger police officers who act to protect members of the public			2
' prosecuting , @entity198 said officers called for back - up after seeing @entity0 and another person dressed in dark clothing with their faces covered			1
he said anarchist groups in @entity16 had carried out arson attacks on buildings including @entity208 and at a police centre in @entity210			1
mr @entity198 said there was no evidence to link @entity0 to previous offences in the city but he pointed out that the stingers were also aimed against police			1
' while it is a matter of fact that no harm was caused to any person the potential is manifest , ' mr @entity198 said			0
' three police cars were taken out of action			2
' @entity227 footage , left , captured the moment one of the squad cars was disabled by the homemade ' stinger ' while two police officers examine the scene of the incident , right , where they recover evidence of the attack representing @entity0 , @entity236 said there was a ' juxtaposition ' between the caring work @entity0 had carried out and her offending			1
he said motivation from the attack had come from the death of a black teenager in @entity29 and police brutality in @entity31			2
' it is also partly her own observation of peaceful protest and what she perceived as the police going further than they should , ' mr @entity236 said			0
' she had come to the realisation that police used stingers on quite a wide scale			2
what she was seeking to do was to give the police a taste of their own medicine			0
' he said his client had sought to damage one or more police cars but had not intended for further harm to be caused			1
@entity20 , pictured , heard that anarchist attacks have caused £ 20 million of damage to the city mr @entity236 said : ' she leads a good life			1
she is very busy caring for other people and is involved in a number of community projects			0
' this is the juxtaposition of someone who works with such compassion and conscience			0
' she is not a self - styled anarchist			0
she puts her time to good use in her community work			0
' she has formed this negative view of the police			0
she has strayed beyond what is reasonable and respectful and has committed this serious offence			0
' she very much regrets that			0
she has strayed beyond what she should have done and is realising the impact of it on those around her			0
' she 's quite ashamed of the way she has let everyone down			0
' detective inspector @entity289 of @entity290 said : ' we have a long and proud history of facilitating peaceful protest and also supporting people who choose alternative lifestyles			0
' we respect their right to lead their lives however they choose and the large majority do so in a safe and law - abiding manner			0
' where protest crosses the line into criminality , we 'll take a tough stance in order to keep our communities safe and feeling safe			0
