when @entity1 striker @entity0 smashed an effort towards goal in the final minute of extra-time against @entity5 he must have thought he was going to be a hero			1
but rather than ripping into the top corner to put @entity1 through and send the hosts crashing out , the ball struck the crossbar , meaning extra-time finished with the score level at 1 - 1			1
rather than try and eradicate the memory of his shot that was agonisingly close to causing a huge upset , @entity0 has chosen to get a tattoo of it on his lower back , with the line , ' one centimetre from glory '			0
the 30 - year - old , who plays for @entity35 side @entity34 , has scored six goals in 30 appearances for his national side			0
@entity1 proved to be one of the surprise packages in @entity5 after beating the reigning world and @entity43 champions @entity44 2 - 0 in the group stage			2
but the last - 16 game against @entity5 was one step too far for @entity49 's side , with @entity5 advancing to the quarter - finals where they will play another @entity53 side @entity54			0
agonising : @entity0 looks on in disbelief after @entity1 lose the last - 16 penalty shoot - out against @entity5 @entity57 breathe a sigh of relief			2

the striker was *introduced* as a late substitute with the score at 1 - 1
his shot in the *119th* minute crashed against the bar
the match went to penalties and @entity5 won the shoot - out to send @entity1 out
he has *decided* to *remember* his shot by getting a tattoo of it on his back
