style over substance this game is being billed as @entity2 , but do n’t underestimate @entity3			2
it ’s not just about style — he plays to win			2
the philosophy @entity3 has imposed has made @entity8 popular throughout the world			1
people love to watch them , certainly more than @entity12 ’s teams			2
but on sunday , he is up against the ultimate pragmatist — @entity12 finds any way to win			1
@entity16 have conceded just two goals in their last six clashes with @entity8 , keeping four clean sheets in the process			1
@entity12 does exactly what ’s necessary			2
so while @entity3 always aims to win , he still cares about the brand of football played			2
@entity12 ’s brand is winning			0
@entity3 ( left ) pushed @entity12 when @entity16 beat @entity8 6 - 0 at @entity25 last season wenger can not be underestimated , according to @entity28 ... it 's not all about style , he plays to win talking tactics @entity8 should dominate possession while @entity16 are more likely to sit deep and use the electric pace of @entity34 and @entity35 on the break			1
@entity16 will be very disciplined and in some ways that is a shame because the players are n’t allowed to express themselves as they might			0
in the reverse fixture in october , @entity16 pressed @entity8 all over and @entity3 ’s side were stifled — they did not get a shot on target for the first time in a @entity46 match since 2003			1
@entity12 creates such an intensity and focus that winning becomes a matter of life and death			0
but @entity8 will send waves of players forward at pace and try to isolate @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 , who are not the quickest			0
@entity28 ( right ) and @entity3 go back a long way , after @entity28 's two stints at @entity8 during his career @entity16 boss @entity12 always finds a way to win and has a brilliant record against @entity3 change the record @entity12 's record over @entity3 is remarkable			1
not many managers can say they have never lost to @entity3			0
@entity12 feels he knows @entity3 ’s game and the @entity8 boss ca n’t surprise him			1
i ’d be amazed if @entity16 go all out to attack , but they will still pack a punch on the break			0
flavour of the month @entity12 wants to win every trophy going but he has a poor record in the @entity74			1
he has only won it three times , the same as @entity78 and one fewer than @entity79			0
@entity3 has won it 14 times			0
the @entity83 difference @entity83 has enjoyed a brilliant season at @entity16 but i do n’t think he would have necessarily benefited @entity8 had he joined			1
that central midfield area is very congested and he would have halted @entity88 ’s progress			0
but one thing is certain on sunday — he wo n’t receive a warm welcome			0
@entity12 has a poor @entity74 record ; he has won as many as @entity78 @entity83 has been impressive this season , but he would n't necessarily have been as good with @entity8			1

@entity16 travel to the @entity94 to face @entity8 on sunday *afternoon*
@entity12 has an impressive record against @entity3
despite that , @entity3 can not be underestimated - he plays to win
@entity83 has impressed this season , but he would not necessarily have had the same impact if he had joined @entity8 from @entity102
