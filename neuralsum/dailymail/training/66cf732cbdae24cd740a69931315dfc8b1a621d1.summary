since militant group @entity2 claimed to have established an @entity4 caliphate , the city of @entity1 has become known as its fanatical capital			1
but reports from groups inside the city say there is growing resentment between the poor , who have been largely left to fend for themselves , and @entity4 fighters , who live a life of five - star luxury			1
while fighters have each been given a pay - rise and a roast lamb to feast on for the festival of @entity21 , the poor have been left to suffer as food an fuel prices spike			1
civilians hospitals have also been closed down as doctors abandon their posts , or run out of medical supplies , leaving people to travel to @entity58 for medical help , with many dying along the way			1
speaking to @entity61 , a source who used the fake name of @entity64 , said : ' as soon as they arrived , they became the elite of the community			0
' they were given comfortable homes and cars -- and they get a generous salary every month			0
' recently , a bombing left many people , including fighters , badly hurt			2
' we ran to help and saw @entity2 trucks arrive and remove their men for treatment , leaving the civilians just lying there			2
' suffering : meanwhile the civilians of @entity1 have been left to suffer the ravages of spiraling food prices and hospitals closing down because of a lack of doctors destitute : while fighters have become wealthier under islamic state rule , the city 's poorest have become even poorer as they are largely left to fend for themselves there are also reports of boys as young as 14 and 15 being snatched from their families and sent to training camps to become @entity2 warriors			1
the @entity99 - based @entity98 claims sources have spoken of growing unrest in the city between residents and their new leaders			0
many have objected to the harsh punishments handed out by the @entity108 patrols , who have been brought into to enforce strict @entity111 laws			0
residents say that while they have turned a blind eye to manipulative traders hiking food and fuel prices , they mercilessly punish minor infringement such as smoking cigarettes			0
there has also been growing resentment against the @entity122 , a female patrol thought to contain several @entity99 jihadis , who patrol in disguise unlike their male counterparts .			0
