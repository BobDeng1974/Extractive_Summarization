by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 07:13 est , 10 september 2012 updated : 10:27 est , 10 september 2012 denial : @entity3 says he is definitely not going to return to @entity4 @entity3 today attempted to play down rumours sweeping through @entity6 that he will take a safe commons seat and mount an immediate leadership challenge if @entity9 fails to secure an overall majority at the next election			1
the mayor of @entity13 dismissed the plot as ' complete cloud cuckoo land ' but did not rule out a return to @entity4 when he leaves @entity17 in 2016			1
mr @entity3 was forced to respond today after @entity19 @entity18 offered his west @entity13 seat to him if the @entity22 forces through plans for a third runway at @entity25			1
he said he will ' absolutely not ' be returning to @entity4 while he is mayor			1
it has today been confirmed he has met with @entity18 to discuss the airport issue , but a source said they ' jokingly ' discussed the by - election but ' dismissed it out of hand			2
' ' this is all complete cloud cuckoo land , ' the mayor told @entity13 's @entity35			1
' of course i ’ve had conversations with @entity18 and with other @entity38 in @entity13 and elsewhere about how to solve the aviation problem			0
i ’m absolutely not going to be returning to @entity4 , i ’ve got to do a job here in @entity13 and that ’s what i want to do and it ’s a massive , engrossing job			0
' later he told the @entity46 about his plans for post- 2016 : ' i really think i ’ll be over the hill , i ’ll be clapped out			0
' allies of the @entity13 mayor , whose popularity has been boosted by the success of the @entity53 and @entity54 , played down the prospect of him making a @entity6 comeback before that			1
their comments came despite swirling rumours of plots against the prime minister to install mr @entity3			1
but colonel @entity75 told them to ‘ get lost ’			0
running scared ? the prime minister arrived back at @entity85 this morning after a jog , after news that mr @entity3 may be poised to challenge him the mayor infuriated @entity90 by going to war with mr @entity9 last week , criticising what he called a ‘ fudgearama ’ over increasing airport capacity			2
but a spokesman for mr @entity3 dismissed as ‘ fanciful ’ a claim that multi- millionaire @entity19 rebel @entity18 , who has threatened to quit @entity4 if the government goes ahead with a third runway at @entity25 , offered his south - west @entity13 seat to the mayor			1
however , despite the denials from @entity17 , the rumours about mr @entity3 's return to @entity6 do not seem to be going away			1
the two men were said to have discussed the prospect of a by - election in mr @entity18 ’s @entity108 constituency following last week ’s cabinet reshuffle , in which mr @entity9 sidelined ministers who are opposed to @entity25 expansion			1
mr @entity3 did meet mr @entity18 and the by - election scheme is thought to have been ‘ jokingly ’ mentioned , but the mayor is said to have dismissed it out of hand			1
mr @entity18 wrote yesterday on @entity116 : ‘ i have never offered to resign ! but i did promise before the election that i would , if the @entity119 on @entity25			1
’ but mps who want to see mr @entity3 in @entity121 confirmed privately that advanced discussions had taken place on finding him a seat for the 2015 election			1
mr @entity18 ’s seat is not considered safe enough because it is a marginal			1
two that have been discussed by mr @entity3 ’s supporters are @entity129 , where veteran mp sir @entity130 might be persuaded to step down , and @entity131 , the mayor ’s old commons seat			1
mr @entity3 has always insisted he has no intention of trying to oust mr @entity9 and has pledged to see out his second term as mayor			2
but while he would be heavily criticised if he tried to combine the role of mayor and mp for an extended period , he is due to leave office in @entity13 in 2016			0
that would mean the two jobs would only overlap for a year if he made a comeback at the next general election			0
one rebel @entity130 said : ‘ the aim is that @entity3 is in place at the next election			2
if @entity9 loses the election badly , he ’ll resign and @entity3 will stand , but if he misses a majority again and tries to stitch up another coalition with the @entity153 then there will be blood on the walls			2
we wo n’t let him do it again			0
’ another rebel @entity19 , @entity158 , said : ‘ we need to get @entity3 in and @entity9 out to survive 2015			1
’ but mr @entity3 said he was ‘ absolutely not ’ planning a return to the @entity160			2
‘ as i said in the election about a billion times , being mayor is the best job in @entity166 politics and it ’s what i want to do , ’ he said			0
after his election defeat in may , @entity169 was tipped to disappear from the political world once and for all			0
but today he reappeared and managed to have a dig at his old foe @entity3 over @entity68 , accusing him of having ' milked it for everything he can get out of it			0
' wearing the same jacket he wore when @entity13 won the @entity179 in 2005 when he was mayor , mr @entity169 denied he was jealous of mr @entity3 's soaring popularity because of the @entity53			2
it came the night after the pair met by coincidence at the @entity54 closing ceremony , where they had a quick bicker and then @entity3 playfully rubbed the top of his head much to the delight of @entity190 leader @entity189 who was watching on			0
speaking as @entity166 's sportsmen and women marched through the streets of @entity13 today , @entity169 took the chance to lay into mr @entity3 and also dismissed his chances of taking over at @entity85			0
' [ @entity3 ] has milked it for everything he can get out of it			0
i look at what we ’ve achieved and the difference it ’s made in the @entity205			0
all i say to @entity3 is , you ’ve had your fun now what are you going to build that the next mayor will open 10 or 12 years down the road ? ' ' i simply say , when i chat to @entity3 , do n’t worry about being prime minister , you can do things as big as this that will put @entity13 on the international map again solidly in 2020			2
' he also dismissed @entity3 's plans for a @entity217 airport in the @entity218 , saying ' it is never going to happen '			0
video : ' mad ' plan for a third runway is back on , warns @entity3			0
