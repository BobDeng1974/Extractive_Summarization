by @entity1 reporter last updated at 5:25 pm on 29th september 2011 a 24 - year - old woman can never take a nap on a whim , because a rare disease means falling asleep unexpectedly would kill her			1
@entity6 is the second oldest woman in the @entity7 living with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome			1
sufferers of the condition simply forget to breathe whenever they fall asleep due to a fault in the neurological reflex that controls breathing and there is nothing they can do about it			1
sleeping soundly : @entity6 , pictured with boyfriend @entity17 , must spend each night on a ventilator living with the condition means that @entity6 has never fallen asleep at her desk , had a childhood sleepover or nodded off on a train			1
the only way she can sleep at all is by using a special mask ventilator which breathes for her while she sleeps			2
she said : ' it 's become a subconscious thing now because i have had the condition my whole life			1
' i know i can never just nod off somewhere because i will die			2
if i get sleepy during the day , i just walk around and try to shake it off			2
' making sure i get a good night 's sleep is really important and i do n't drink apart from the odd glass as long as my mum and dad are with me because i 'm scared of getting drunk and maybe passing out			1
' @entity6 spent the first two years of her life in hospital while doctors attempted to work out why she would suddenly stop breathing			1
only 1 in 200,000 children are born with the condition but only around 200 people in the world currently live with it as the mortality rate is so high			1
@entity6 is one of just 30 @entity49 sufferers in the @entity7			1
also known as @entity52 's curse , the condition is named after the myth of a water nymph who had an unfaithful mortal lover who swore to her that his ' every waking breath would be a testimony of his love '			1
upon witnessing his adultery , she cursed that if he should fall asleep , he would forget to breathe			2
speaking from the family home in @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity6 's mother and full - time carer @entity68 , 51 , said : ' my pregnancy with @entity6 had been completely normal right up until the moment she was born			1
' she immediately turned blue and was whisked away to the neo-natal unit			2
at first , the doctors just wanted to monitor her but they found that every time she went to sleep she would stop breathing , her oxygen levels would drop and they would have to wake her up again			2
' but they could only do that for so long as she was getting so tired and eventually they put her on a ventilator			0
' none of the doctors or nurses had ever seen anything like it before			0
the consultant ended up ringing every children 's unit in the country in search of answers			0
' determined : @entity6 says she wants to live as normal a life as possible eventually , prof @entity92 , professor of paediatrics at @entity94 diagnosed @entity6 with one of the @entity7 's first cases of @entity49			1
she had a tracheostomy operation to insert a breathing tube into her neck , but doctors were still too afraid to allow her to go home with her parents			2
it was n't until she was two years old that she was allowed home for a few hours a day			0
eventually , @entity68 and her husband @entity105 , 56 , a welder , were trained to use the ventilation machine and oxygen monitors which allowed @entity6 to sleep			1
@entity68 said : ' with the condition being so rare , the doctors did n't know what to expect or what her life expectancy might be			2
she was being ventilated nearly 24 hours a day so there was no way she could come home			0
' the first night she came home was @entity117 and we just sat with her all night long			2
both of us were too terrified to go to sleep in case something happened			0
' after that , i would go to bed for half the night and @entity105 would watch her , then i would get up and let him get a few hours sleep			2
' we were always tired but we had to do it for our peace of mind			0
nowadays , people with @entity49 have nurses seven nights a week , but for ten years we were completely on our own			0
' there were a lot of scares			0
one time she caught the measles and clinically died in hospital			0
@entity139 is dangerous for anyone but with @entity49 children it severely affects their breathing and they had to bring in a crash team to revive her			0
' @entity6 's parents were woken between 50 - 60 times a night by the various alarms rigged to her bedtime breathing equipment			1
and when @entity6 started school , she had to have an adult accompany her at all times , making it difficult for her to fit in and make friends			1
then , last year , @entity6 was struck down with @entity155 which almost proved fatal			1
she spent ten days in hospital recovering , during four of which she was in a coma			0
once again she had amazed doctors with her incredible survival , even after her heart stopped and they were once again forced to revive her			0
now , after completing a course in computing at her local college , @entity6 is eager to get on with her life			1
she spends most nights with her van - driver boyfriend @entity167 , 29 , who has had to adapt to spending his nights with a masked bedfellow			0
@entity6 said : ' growing up was very isolating			1
i 'd spent the first two years of my life in hospital and i was n't able to make any sounds at all until i was 18 months old because of the traceostomy			0
' then , having an adult around all the time at school made it difficult to fit in			0
they even used to follow me to the toilet because the school insisted i needed supervision " just in case " " it was only when i started college at 18 that things started to improve			0
' all my life i had been told i could n't do things in case something happened , but now i want to get out there and get a job and start living my life like everyone else			0
' i do feel a certain duty as one of the oldest sufferers of @entity49 to show that it is possible to live a normal life and that they should n't be afraid of the future			0

@entity6 is one of only 200 in the world to suffer from the condition
her parents were woken 60 times a night as alarms alerted them that their little girl had fallen asleep
