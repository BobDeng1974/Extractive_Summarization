by @entity0 faced with the birth of their first child , @entity1 and @entity2 decided they needed to tighten their belts			1
realising that supermarkets were costing them a small fortune , they set themselves the challenge of shunning them for a year			1
sticking to ten strict rules , the couple limited their food budget to £ 50 a week and began buying all their groceries from local shops and markets			1
shop swap : @entity1 and @entity2 gave up supermarkets before the birth of their daughter @entity24 and say they have saved money and have a better diet a year later , they have not only completed their challenge , they have saved themselves £ 895.23 – and are reaping the benefits of a healthier lifestyle			1
it has been such a success the couple , who live in @entity36 , @entity37 , with 18 - month - old daughter @entity38 , have now decided to give up supermarkets for good			1
mrs @entity2 , 29 , said : ‘ i used to think we spent £ 50 on the weekly supermarket shop			1
but when i looked at the bank statements it was more like £ 90			1
‘ the trouble is you do the weekly shop then end up popping in to get bread and milk one day and come out with a load of other stuff you had n’t planned on getting because you see all the two - for - ones and special offers as you go round			1
‘ you see things for £ 1 and think that ’s really cheap , but if you stopped to think about it you do n’t really need them			1
supermarkets are engineered to make you buy			1
that ’s why the bread and milk is at the back			2
‘ you can definitely buy certain things cheaper in supermarkets			1
but it ’s the lifestyle change which has made the savings – we ’re not buying food or products any more , but ingredients , and the amount of them we need , to make things			2
‘ we used to waste a lot of things we could n’t get through			2
‘ now we do n’t have to buy large quantities of things because that ’s how they come packaged			0
i have the time to cook from scratch every day and we make the most of everything we buy			0
‘ for example , we buy a quality chicken from the butcher which we will roast , then have cold in sandwiches and use the carcass to make stock or soup			0
’ the @entity89 ’ ten rules include the opportunity to eat out in a restaurant once a fortnight and the need to avoid wasting any food or drink			0
they shop at a local street market and monthly farmer ’s market			0
they use the local butcher ’s , delicatessen and cheese shop and have even started getting their pork straight from a nearby farm			0
they have also begun making their own bread and get their eggs from their hens @entity111			0
if for any reason , they failed to stick to their £ 50 budget , the couple slashed the following week ’s budget by half			1
mr @entity119 , 28 , an academic administrator at @entity120 at the @entity121 , has had to give up his favourite biscuits , but his sweet tooth is now more than satisfied by his wife ’s home - made cakes			1
mrs @entity2 , who blogged about her ‘ @entity127 ’ during her maternity leave from her job as a mental health worker , said : ‘ we are healthier as we have lost weight , and we really appreciate things we used to take for granted like golden syrup , which is ridiculously cheap in supermarkets compared to elsewhere			1
‘ we think a lot more about what we ’re eating too			0
if you fry a bit of supermarket bacon it usually shrivels away and there ’s a lot of water			2
‘ ours is n’t like that any more – we know where it comes from and that the pigs have been cared for			0
we meet the traders and hear about their products			0
it ’s all an added bonus			0
’ she added : ‘ it ’s been a good discipline to learn to live this way			0
we ’ve been under our £ 50 a week food budget – on average we spend about £ 35			2
' i used to keep the cupboard rammed full as if we were expecting a nuclear disaster			0
now i just get in what we need			0
' we ’re eating better quality food , certainly more fruit and vegetables			0
@entity24 has never had any preserved or processed food			1
it ’s all been home - made			2
‘ our diet is also more varied			2
we buy vegetables in season and meat like pheasant and venison which before we ’d have associated with paying for in a restaurant			0

@entity1 and @entity2 gave up supermarkets to save money
*experiment* began before the birth of their daughter @entity24
over the year they have saved £ *900* and say their diet is better
now they plan to stay supermarket - free forever
