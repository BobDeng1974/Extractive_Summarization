the @entity1 derby is now one of the biggest match - ups in world football			1
millions across the globe cram around tv screens to catch a glimpse of the fixture , and its appeal gets ever greater with each passing season			2
but just how @entity1 is the clash between @entity13 and @entity14 ? @entity15 takes a look at everything local between the two giants			1
@entity19 and @entity13 travel to @entity20 to face @entity14 on sunday afternoon owners you will not find many @entity14 fans who pine for the days when @entity24 , son of a @entity26 butcher , ruled the roost at @entity20			1
despite being the man who brought sir @entity29 to the club and backed him when many wanted him sacked , former chairman @entity24 ( who was later cautioned after a peeping tom episode in a ladies toilet ) remained a figure of distrust			0
likewise , there will not be many @entity13 supporters who look back fondly on the chaotic era of hometown former tv salesman and combover king @entity42 , who often came across as out of tune with reality ( if you get a chance watch the hilariously belief - defying @entity13 ! documentary on @entity48 ) , as he went through manager after manager after manager			1
@entity42 was local , but not many @entity13 fans want to be reminded of his chairmanship not many @entity14 fans pine for the days when @entity24 , son of a @entity26 butcher , ruled the roost @entity58 might not be local but is a hugely popular figure at @entity13 after bankrolling the club @entity61 ( left ) and @entity62 have proved divisive figures at @entity14 since their family bought the club at @entity20 , there remains a resentment for those upstairs			1
that the owners are from @entity70 and not @entity68 , however , is irrelevant			0
the @entity62 family could be from @entity72 - their cash - draining tenure is still hard to take even though the yellow and green scarves are not as easy to spot			2
across town , however , the sheikh who shook it up for the @entity78 is a hero			0
is there a more popular owner in football ? while @entity13 fans may no longer ( thankfully ) pay homage by wearing @entity88 robes or waving Â£ 20 notes in the air , the man from @entity84 is adored			2
managers it has always been rare to find a football club with a hometown manager			0
however , you do get the sense that both @entity97 and @entity98 do their best to familairise themselves with their environment			1
@entity103 has taken a lot of local knowledge from @entity106			2
more than once the @entity107 has asked the son of @entity26 ( via @entity109 ) to speak to the players about the opposition and tell them exactly what victory would mean to the supporters			0
@entity106 , a fierce @entity114 , is said to have come into his own when @entity115 were next up			0
@entity97 has tried to immerse himself in the local culture after taking over as manager last summer @entity103 has leaned on assistant boss @entity106 for tips around the city during his stint in charge @entity98 has been keen to familiarise himself with @entity1 over the last two years manager @entity98 with chairman @entity124 ( left ) over in @entity84 last may @entity103 , who originally stationed himself at a city centre hotel , frequented many of the city 's finest eating establishments and knows his way around town			1
while you wo n't see @entity98 supping a pint of mild next to the bronze statue of @entity135 in city centre backstreet boozer @entity137 , the @entity131 has also been quick to immerse himself in local culture			1
not too long after his arrival he was spotted in a @entity141 picture shop , having maps of the local area framed for his walls			0
however , when this reporter once asked him if he had been anywhere nice during his time off the answer of ' @entity149 ' was not what was expected			0
coaches the aforementioned @entity106 , as assistant manager , gives the coaching staff at @entity20 a homegrown element			2
@entity155 ( right , at @entity156 on monday ) is @entity1 through and through @entity155 is more @entity157 than @entity159 dancer @entity158 drinking a can of @entity161 in the rain unless @entity164 makes a comeback for @entity14 there wo n't be any local lads in the two @entity167 aside from the local lad , the only things missing from @entity169 are a windmill and some tulips with @entity107 quintet @entity173 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 and @entity179 key players			1
it is a similar situation at @entity13 with @entity155 , more @entity157 than @entity158 drinking a can of @entity161 in the rain , co-assistant manager alongside a number of the boss 's trusted lieutenants			2
@entity187 splits responsibilities with @entity155 while goalkeeping coach @entity189 and @entity190 , both @entity191 , complete the @entity193 look			0
players both clubs pride themselves on bringing through their own products			0
however , when sir @entity29 arrived at @entity20 he was disgusted to learn that @entity13 scooped the cream of @entity1 's talent and quickly ( and successfully ) set about putting that right			1
a generation such as the class of ' 92 is unlikely to be seen again , but the derby could see no @entity205 in either squad for the second time in a row			0
for three years , after the departure of @entity210 to @entity211 , @entity208 flew the @entity1 flag			0
but following the @entity215 lad 's move to @entity216 , november 's first instalment at the @entity218 saw not one hometown native in either squad for the first time in living memory			0
sir @entity29 was disgusted that @entity13 's youth academy was more profitable on arrival at @entity14 along with @entity29 , @entity225 ( left ) brought through the @entity226 , to include @entity106 , @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 and @entity232 @entity233 was only born 30 miles down the road but he may as well be from another planet as far as many from this neck of the woods are concerned			1
there will be @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity191 , @entity242 and maybe even a @entity243 , but unless @entity164 can stun the football world and force his way into @entity103 's line - up , it will be a @entity157 - free derby			2
fans interest in the derby will be spread all over the world			0
@entity14 like to remind us of their 659m global followers while @entity13 , according to a recent club - commissioned report , have a fanbase that is rapidly expanding across the planet			1
outside @entity20 , street vendors will attempt to flog half - and - half scarves			1
some of the tourists may even buy them			0
@entity13 fans are derided by their rivals for the amount of ' empty seats ' at the @entity218 regardless , nowhere will victory be celebrated with as much vigour and defeat taken with as much bitterness as in @entity1			1
no @entity14 fans from @entity1 ? city fans all from @entity270 ? nonsense			2
ask any @entity114 or @entity271 if they fancy going into work on monday after a derby loss and they will give you the same answer			0
while @entity13 fans may serenade their hosts with ' you 're the pride of @entity281 ' and @entity14 supporters respond in kind with jibes about empty seats at ' the council house ' both know that this is a city divided by football loyalties .			1

@entity14 host bitter rivals @entity13 on sunday afternoon
it could be a derby without a single local player on either side
@entity97 and @entity98 have both tried to immerse themselves in the local culture
