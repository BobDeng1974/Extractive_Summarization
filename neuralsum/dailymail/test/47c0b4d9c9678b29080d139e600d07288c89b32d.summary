@entity0 , 11 , was told he would never walk - but has now taken his first steps unaided an 11 - year - old boy told he would never walk has taken his first steps unaided thanks to pioneering treatment in the @entity6			1
@entity0 was born with bones missing from his legs , due to the rare condition bilateral tibial hemimelia			1
doctors said the condition - which affects just one in three million people - meant he would to have his right leg amputated or fused straight			1
but his loved ones refused to accept these grim prospects , which would have left @entity0 severely disabled for life			2
instead , they began desperately trying to find other suitable treatments , and eventually found an @entity6 surgeon called dr @entity20 , who assured @entity0 's parents his leg could be saved			1
through tireless fundraising , @entity23 and mrs @entity24 managed to raise £ 135,000 to take their son to the @entity6 for surgery			1
he underwent a series of operations – including one to break his right leg and start lengthening his femur ( thigh bone )			0
now , @entity0 is walking unaided – without the stints he formerly needed - and can even play cricket and tennis			1
his mother , @entity36 , 43 , said : ' from the moment he was born our goal in life has been for him to keep his legs			0
' we knew we would do everything in our power for him			0
before we went to @entity6 , @entity0 was getting worse			1
' he was in pain and reliant on his crutches			0
it was awful to see			0
' we knew we had to raise £ 135,000 and our friends have been brilliant			0
we have had amazing donations			0
but if we had n't our plan b was to re-mortgage the house			0
' @entity0 was born with no shin bone ( tibia ) and no knee in his right leg , and only a partial shin bone in his left leg			1
for the first year of his life , every doctor said that his leg would eventually be amputated			2
but his family discovered a @entity61 surgeon called professor @entity62 who had been working on @entity0 's rare problem , and he agreed to come to @entity64 to perform a pioneering 10 hour operation on @entity0 's legs			1
the surgery was hugely successful and for the next few years , @entity0 was able to walk on his own and play with other children			1
throughout his childhood years , @entity0 underwent over 60 hours of surgery as doctors tried to rebuild his legs over and over again as he has grew			1
but in february last year , when @entity0 was 10 , @entity74 doctors told his parents there was nothing more they could do for him , and recommended he have his leg amputated , or fused straight			1
but his family refused to give up and combed the medical literature for alternatives , eventually coming across dr @entity20 , an orthopaedic surgeon in @entity80			2
he claims to be the most experienced limb lengthening and deformity correction surgeon in the @entity6 as well as internationally			2
@entity0 was born with bones missing from his legs , due to the rare condition bilateral tibial hemimelia			1
at 10 - years - old doctors said nothing more could be done for him and he would need to have his leg amputated throughout his childhood years , @entity0 underwent more than 60 hours of surgery as doctors tried to rebuild his legs over and over again as he has grew dr @entity20 said he would be able to save @entity0 's leg and allow him to walk , so his parents began fundraising more than £ 100,000 to take their son to the @entity6			1
they held karaoke night , @entity94 night , cake sales , races , sponsored walks and convinced local companies to donate			0
setting up social media accounts and a website meant people could donate directly to @entity0 's cause			2
they were able to raise the cash and @entity0 underwent his first lengthy operation on march 27			2
he then had three more operations between may and november			0
each day for several weeks , his parents had to turn struts placed in their son 's leg to allow the bone to grow			0
since his return , @entity0 ( pictured right with his mother ) is now able to walk without crutches , play tennis , cricket and even hopes to drive cars			2
he is pictured , left , as a baby , after being diagnosed after nine months , on december 19 , @entity0 and his parents returned to their home near @entity119 , @entity120			0
since his return , @entity0 has made immense progress and over the last week has been able to walk without crutches			2
but while the @entity123 are celebrating @entity0 's success , the ordeal is not over as he will need further surgery to lengthen his right leg in three years time			1
the rod inserted in his leg may also be removed and he will require a knee implant			0
@entity0 said : ' it 's getting easier			0
it was difficult at times because of the pain			0
' the highlight for me was when the frame came off on november 19			0
and it makes it a lot easier to get dressed in the morning without callipers [ stints ]			0
