by @entity0 rail bosses have been forced to take action after confused tourists kept turning up at a railway station called @entity5 expecting to find the famous @entity7 zebra crossing			1
@entity8 decided to erect a tongue - in - cheek notice to inform baffled visitors that they 've come to the wrong place			1
the genuine iconic crossing - which featured on the cover of @entity7 ' album of the same name - is actually more than 10 miles away in the suburb of @entity18 near the recording studios where it was recorded			1
wrong direction : the @entity5 in the @entity22 is not quite as famous as its namesake in @entity24 iconic : the cover of @entity7 1969 album @entity5 featuring the @entity7 but local commuters say scores of hapless tourists regularly turn up at the @entity22 station assuming it must be home to the famous @entity5			2
the gently mocking sign explains that tourists who may have arrived expecting to find the famous crossing are in the wrong place and explains how to get back to the correct location			2
several of the most famous @entity7 songs including ' daytripper ' , ' help ' , ' @entity41 ' and ' @entity42 ' are cleverly weaved into the sign which has been placed in the station entrance by one of the platforms			1
light - hearted : @entity8 recently erected this sign in an effort to explain to confused tourists who arrive in the wrong place tourists who turned up asking locals for directions expressed their amusement at the sign yesterday - after getting over the initial disappointment at being at the wrong station			1
@entity55 , 30 , who was visiting @entity56 from @entity57 , said : ' it 's pretty confusing			0
' how is somebody who has never been to this country before know which one is which ? ' i do like the sign though - it is very @entity67 humour			0
' while oversees it student @entity68 , 21 , added : ' it 's the only @entity5 on the tube map , so i just assumed it was here			0
' i love the sign though , it kind of softens the blow of being 10 miles the wrong direction			1
' local business owners did ask @entity8 to change the name of the @entity78 station to put an end to the confusion when it opened in 2011			2
@entity81 , 33 , who lives in @entity82 , said : ' it 's been quite annoying actually - the station is always full of baffled tourists wandering around			2
' i suppose you 've got to laugh at it though and it looks like that is what @entity8 have done			0
' it makes a nice change to signs constantly telling you about engineering works , that 's for sure			0
' error : some tourists have assumed that the @entity99 stop must be home of the famous studios and zebra crossing attraction : tourists recreate the @entity7 ' album cover on the zebra crossing at @entity5 in @entity24 a @entity8 spokesperson said : ' some visitors to @entity56 have been taking the name of the @entity78 station as indicating the location of the @entity113 recording studio made famous by the @entity7 and their album , @entity5			1
' this poster displayed at the station will help them find their way to where they want to be			0
' we hope the humour in it may help alleviate their dismay at finding themselves so far off course as they realise they are not the only ones to have made the mistake			0
' the @entity5 crossing was recently voted the number one ' must see ' @entity7 site in the @entity67 on @entity134			0
history : the @entity5 recording studios remains one of the most famous in the world not so famous : the @entity78 station in east @entity56 opened in 2011			1
business owners complained at the time that it should be named something else to avoid the confusion			0
