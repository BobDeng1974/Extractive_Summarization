' graveyard : the new addition includes this rather sinister grave that appears to be a book with @entity58 ? printed on it odd : one graves features a memorial book of with extract from both @entity63 , left , and a quote from horror film @entity65 on the other , right unsettling : another smaller grave features the words ' believe in nothing ' in a downwards triangle @entity71 , 76 , a retired boiler - maker , said : ' i think it 's a bit daft			1
i do n't know what he 's thinking - you do n't see him much			2
' when he first started doing the garden he said he was going to put a lawn there but i do n't know what happened after that - it 's a bit different			2
