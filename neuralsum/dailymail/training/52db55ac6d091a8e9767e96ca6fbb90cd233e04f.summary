@entity1 's imminent £ 59.7million deal to join @entity2 will help improve @entity3 , according to @entity4			1
the former @entity6 defender believes that the signing of @entity8 will help get the best out of @entity3 , with the @entity11 's movement off - the - ball proving beneficial to the playmaker			1
it 's been a sluggish start for @entity3 and @entity2 this season but @entity4 believes the addition of @entity8 will help the @entity19 flourish in new boss @entity21 's 3 - 5 - 2 formation			1
' @entity3 relies on people running past him			2
he manipulates the ball , shifts it from side to side but then he relies upon the runs and the fact that @entity2 are playing without great pace in the team at the moment is n't helping him at all			2
' his goal record from central positions has been good			0
he 's scored seven goals in 10 central appearances			0

hotly - anticipated : @entity8 ( left ) is set to join @entity2 in a £ 59.7million deal ' he is n't any good out wide , that 's why he left @entity48 , he had assurances that he was going to play in central areas , that 's part of the reason why @entity21 is playing the system that he 's playing - to get @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity3 in the team			1
we 'll now see how he integrates @entity58 into the team			0
' do n't worry about the fact that you have too many important players that you might not be able to fit in			0
you 'll need them in a season of 40 - 050 games			0
' despite the deal to bring @entity8 to @entity68 , @entity4 believes @entity2 need to strengthen in other areas if they are to improve on last season 's disappointing seventh place finish			1
club legend : @entity4 enjoyed a trophy - laden spell at @entity2 as a player the deposed @entity77 champions are depleted in defence and midfield at present , and @entity4 has cited these two areas as must for the club to improve on before the transfer window closes on september 1			1
' @entity2 need a central midfield player - a robust central midfield player - and they also need a centre back of real stature , ' he added			1
