by @entity0 published : 07:46 est , 10 november 2013 updated : 10:24 est , 10 november 2013 the @entity1 is preparing to launch an investigation into why the ' execution ' of a wounded @entity5 fighter only came to light when civilians stumbled across a video of the murder on a soldier 's laptop			1
the @entity12 , known only as @entity13 , was found guilty last week of murdering the @entity5 insurgent in @entity15 , @entity16 , two years ago			1
the 39 - year - old is the first @entity18 soldier to be found guilty of a war crime in @entity16			1
' @entity13 was convicted after footage emerged of him shooting the insurgent at close range in the chest			1
as the man convulsed on the ground , @entity13 told him : ‘ there you are			1
shuffle off this mortal coil , you * * * *			0
it ’s nothing you would n’t do to us			0
’ recording : the footage recorded on @entity51 's helmet camera showed @entity13 , a highly respected non-commissioned officer , order his men to move the captive out of sight of cameras on a surveillance balloon he then turned to comrades and said : ‘ obviously this does n’t go anywhere , fellas			1
i just broke the @entity62			0
’ two other soldiers , @entity51 and @entity64 , were cleared of murder			0
footage was captured on a camera being worn on @entity51 's helmet against orders			0
@entity51 tried to delete the footage but a clip was found by police in september 2012			2
it is believed the clip may have been passed around like a war trophy			2
a total of 30 @entity18 soldiers have been investigated over shooting incidents involving members of the @entity80 or insurgents since 2006			1
a foreign field : after a two - and - a - half week trial , a seven - strong military board found @entity13 guilty			1
his comrades named only as @entity51 and @entity64 were cleared after nine hours of deliberations of the 30 soldiers , marines and airmen investigated in 22 separate inquiries , only three have faced court martial and only one – @entity13 – has been convicted a facebook page has been set up called @entity95 which 10,000 people joined in less than a day			1
but speaking during a visit to @entity15 province , defence secretary @entity97 said nobody on deployment in @entity16 has called for clemency for the @entity12			1
mr @entity97 said it was clear the murder was against the values of both @entity18 and the armed forces , in an interview with the @entity109 programme			1
the defence secretary 's comments echoed the views of general sir @entity113 , the @entity114 of the @entity115 , who said the @entity116 must be ' immaculate ' in upholding judicial process			0
audio : ' it 's nothing you would n't do to us , ' a soldier is heard saying in the recording after the shot is fired mr @entity97 said : ' i have not heard any such suggestions ( for clemency ) here			2
people here understand part of what makes us different from the insurgents and the terrorists that we are going after is we maintain a certain standard			0
' these are standards that are core to our values as a society and core to the values of the @entity115			0
this is an isolated incident , i believe , one individual who has let the side down			0
@entity97 said it was clear the murder was against the values of both @entity18 and the armed forces ' it is not indicative of the kind of behaviour that people in the @entity115 condone or expect to indulge in			1
' i have heard no suggestion since i have been here there is any request for special treatment for anyone convicted of the crime of murder			2
' speaking on the @entity161 @entity160 , gen @entity113 said : ' my position on this is no serviceman or woman of the @entity115 is above the law - not above the law of the country , international law or the law of armed conflict			2
' this was a heinous crime			2
judicial process has found this individual guilty			1
' it would be quite wrong for the armed forces to adopt some special pleading , some sort of exemption			0
' if we try to put ourselves beyond the law or expect special provision from the law , then we start to erode the position where we have a moral ascendancy over those who are our enemies and that is the wrong thing to do			0
' there is a due process that will lead to a sentencing			0
it 's for that process to determine whether or not any form of clemency should be shown in the sentencing ... we would not want our position to be eroded			0
' those in authority over the armed forces should not request any form of leniency ... we should be immaculate in these respects			0
' murder is murder , this is a heinous crime , thankfully it is an exceptional act in terms of the conduct of our armed forces			2

@entity12 , known only as @entity13 , was found guilty of murdering @entity5 insurgent two years ago
the 39 - year - old is the first @entity18 soldier to be found guilty of a war crime in @entity16
