by @entity0 an elderly homeless man watched in tears as the home he 'd built in the woods six years before was torn down by police			1
@entity7 's eyes filled up as he silently watched the sturdy , wooden structure bulldozed along with his carefully tended garden trimmed with a white picket fence			1
until last month , @entity7 lived in a woodland camp of 80 - 100 people , known as @entity13 , on the edge of @entity15 , @entity16			1
as part of a legal settlement with the people of @entity13 , @entity15 had him rehoused in a motel for one year his home was bulldozed at the end of june after a long - running legal battle between @entity15 and the homeless came to an end			1
around five years ago , @entity15 sued the people of @entity13 in order to evict them from the land			1
the township has claimed that the woodlands were endangered wetlands and the trees and environment must be protected			0
but still there are unconfirmed suspicions that building work is being planned for where the camp once stood			0
@entity56 reached out to @entity15 mayor and @entity57 with messages today but received no response at the time of publication			1
following the intervention of a powerful , @entity66 litigation attorney , @entity65 , the homeless community counter-sued the township			1
they reasoned that their camp needed to exist because there was no homeless shelter in @entity72 , @entity16			1
after a long - running battle , the case was finally settled last year			1
each person in the camp was offered temporary housing for a year to leave @entity13 or a cash settlement of $ 3,500			1
the home and its fenced garden were flattened by the bulldozer at the end of june			0
the community had been standing in the woods for eight years @entity7 watched in tears along with two police officers who had grown close to the tented community over their years on the fringe of @entity15 @entity7 's home ended up in a dumpster			1
in exchange , he has been given a year living in a motel by local authorities as part of a court settlement @entity7 was one of the last to leave			1
he had grown up in foster care system and as a young child , had often run away into the woods to live			0
without a family structure , @entity7 had grown comfortable living close to nature and had come to @entity13 for its sense of community			1
he had asked the police officers , with whom the people of @entity13 had a close bond , if they would allow him to watch his little home being torn down			1
they stood alongside him as they bulldozer crushed the home and hoisted it into a dumpster			0
@entity7 , for the next year at least , lives in a motel			2
@entity111 , who made film @entity112 about @entity7 and the community at @entity13 's battle to save their homes , told @entity56 today : ' @entity7 had lived off the land before			2
he 's a friendly , intelligent and hard - working guy			0
' he does n't drink and he does n't do drugs			0
he just wanted to live in the way that he liked			0
it 's sad because he belonged out there			0
' mr @entity111 spent a year with the community of @entity13 , documenting their lives and what brought them to live in the woods			2
the council were fair to the homeless , he said , by moving them one by one over a year - long period and proving them with temporary shelter			1
they also helped with furniture and utilities			0
however people also lost a sense of community with their family , friends and neighbors that had built up over eight years in the woods			1
mr @entity111 said : ' what would have been good would be to give these people the support they needed - social work , job training - things that could help them back on their feet and into society			2
' many people in @entity13 , like @entity7 , had chosen to live there instead of sleeping on the streets or in an endless cycle of temporary shelters			1
although the authorities deemed the woodland camp ' temporary ' , many of the homeless people living there saw it as their home and a place to belong one resident was a keen piano player at the camp , entertaining other residents			1
his playing has been captured as part of new film @entity112 which documents the lives of those who live at @entity13 others in the community were battling drug and alcohol addictions while some were struggling with mental illnesses			0
the film - maker said : ' a lot of homeless people have gone through things where they do n't have family or friends or any support			2
often they are alone in their world			0
' but @entity13 gave them that support - it gave them community and it gave them a sense of belonging and ownership			2
' @entity15 police lt. @entity193 confirmed to @entity56 today that the homeless at @entity13 had been relocated to temporary housing			1
he said : ' a lot of the population were using alcohol and drugs			0
it transpired there were some less than glowing things going on			0
' the officer admitted that although there was no homeless shelter in @entity15 , there was a place in @entity209 ten miles away			2
the film @entity112 focuses on the @entity15 homeless but as mr @entity111 pointed out , tent cities are springing up across the @entity213 the @entity214 on @entity215 pooled media reports on tent cities over five years and found that as of 2013 , there were 100 tent communities in the @entity213 and that number is growing			1
there are more than 630,000 people living homeless in the @entity213 , according to recent figures from the @entity224			2
@entity112 is a concept by @entity16 minister @entity226 who believes in creating new housing solutions to deal with homelessness			2
it has also led to the growth of the tiny house movement which mr @entity111 pointed to as an alternative to tent cities			0
however despite their popularity , the homes have run into problems over strict laws on building codes and zoning			0
mr @entity111 , who previously made films about impoverished communities of the @entity241 , believes that the @entity213 may have something to learn from such third world societies when it comes to its own burgeoning homelessness dilemma			0
he said : ' it did n’t take me long to realize that the answer to poverty in the @entity213 is no different then it is in the poorest areas around the world			0
' maybe this country needs to provide the opportunity for the poor to live a simple life with basic necessities			0
' is n’t it the @entity213 way to allow a person to build a house that they can afford ? our society has become accustomed to creating laws and regulations that forbid people from living a simple life			2
