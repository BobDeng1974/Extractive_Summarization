residents of @entity1 , the @entity3 's largest illegal travellers ' site , lost their @entity5 battle against eviction today			1
the travellers , who have vowed to lodge another appeal , said that they will stand their ground and can not be moved until monday at the earliest they attempted to block their removal from the controversial site near @entity12 , @entity13 , in three linked applications for judicial review			1
the decision means officials will finally be able to evict hundreds of travellers living illegally at the site since 2005 after a legal battle estimated to have cost £ 18m			1
the picnic 's over : @entity1 residents , and sisters , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 sit and drink tea outside the @entity5 on friday day in court : @entity31 , leader of @entity32 which is attempting to evict the travellers , arrives at the @entity5 on friday however this afternoon mr @entity34 , sitting in @entity35 , ruled they had delayed too long in challenging @entity32 's decision to take direct action against them			1
he said the travellers were breaking criminal law on a daily basis by remaining on the site and their removal was necessary to avoid ' the criminal law and the planning system being brought into serious disrepute			1
' the judge said : ' it is the residents of @entity1 who have to comply with the obligation to leave voluntarily			2
' if the removal becomes forcible it would be because of decisions made by the residents not to comply			0
' dismissing all the arguments , the judge observed they had been properly taken into account in many legal actions over the years			1
the judge said he recognised that the removal of the travellers was going to cause ' considerable distress and disruption - but in my judgment the time has manifestly come for steps to enforce the law to be taken '			1
mr @entity34 , whose ruling lasted more than three hours , said : ' the conclusion has been reached time and again that this is just the wrong site for travellers			1
' the planning system had always included a ' fair consideration ' of ' personal circumstances '			0
he added : ' the @entity1 residents have had that , but they have lost			0
' the judge said : ' the criminal law applies equally to all - travellers and others alike			1
' support : residents have created a @entity85 @entity1 ! message using paper close to the site dispute : the @entity1 site has become a target for protesters who sympathise with the travellers @entity94 , vice-chair of the @entity95 , said : ' we are disappointed			2
we are not surprised but the fight goes on			0
we will be seeking permission to appeal			2
' another resident , @entity99 said outside the gates of the site that families were ' oo distraught ' to speak after they lost their @entity104			0
' people are already flooding back , both travellers and supporters , ' mr @entity99 told reporters			1
' we are expecting a big swell over the next couple of days and we 'll be ready for when they come			0
' he added : ' of course we are going to try and appeal this decision but we do n't know what 's going to happen there			2
' at the end of the day we will be here for them and we 'll have to rely on the physical defences now that the legal ones have failed us			2
' @entity32 has been fighting to remove the travellers since 2005 , but a judge gave them a stay of execution last week			1
the residents triumphantly declared they would be still be living there in 30 years			0
the 86 families who face eviction argued that they should not be removed because the land they bought in 2001 was being used as a scrapyard			2
their lawyers had argued the council 's decision earlier this year to take direct action to clear the land was in breach of their human rights and unreasonable			2
or will you ? the travellers now face removal by bailiffs if they refuse to leave the land they also argued there had been a failure to offer residents suitable alternative accommodation and to take account of vulnerable residents , including the sick in need of regular medication and children whose schooling would be disrupted if families were evicted			1
@entity32 said only a small part of the farm was being used as a scrapyard and it has always hoped to return it to green - belt status			1
pleased : @entity32 leader @entity31 arrives at the @entity5 yesterday , and said after the verdict that he took ' quiet satisfaction ' from it some critics have condemned the court battle as a ' farce ' , which could cost in the region of £ 18million			1
one of the applications has been brought by @entity170 , who claims being evicted would be a breach of her human rights			0
although @entity32 has said the travellers can apply for accommodation , her barrister @entity173 argued that it had an ‘ obligation to facilitate the gipsy way of life ’			1
mr @entity173 said the case had an ' extensive history ' but ms @entity94 was not claiming she should be allowed to stay at @entity1 ' forever - or indeed for many years , or even a year '			2
@entity32 's leader @entity31 said tonight : ' this is not a day for triumphalism , but i do take quiet satisfaction on behalf of local people that in all matters the council has been found to have acted lawfully			1
' the residents of the illegal settlement at @entity1 have now had their day in court			0
for almost three weeks every aspect of the council 's decision to clear @entity1 has been scrutinised in great detail and our position has been upheld			0
' as for the travellers - having engaged with the legal system they must now abide by the law			1
' i would like to reflect on what the judge said that the criminal law applies equally to all , travellers and others alike			1
they have reached the end of the road			0
i would therefore urge them to do two things			0
' firstly i would ask them to see that their supporters stand down and preferably leave the site			0
if they have the travellers ' best interests at heart they will do this			0
there is now nothing to be gained by their continued resistance and certainly not if it involves violence and other forms of law breaking as some have suggested			0
' secondly i hope the travellers will now comply with the court 's ruling and leave @entity1 in a peaceful and orderly manner			2
' i strongly urge the travellers not to return to the path of unlawful resistance			0
' it is too early yet to say exactly when the site clearance will begin			0
that will be a decision for the officers and our partners , such as the police , and will primarily depend upon how quickly all the necessary resources can be put back in place so it can be done safely			0
