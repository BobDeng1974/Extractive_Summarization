just over a decade ago @entity0 was voted the greatest @entity2 player of all time in a poll of the club 's supporters			1
this may seem a little premature , but as @entity10 prepares for to make his 100th @entity12 appearance for @entity2 at @entity13 on sunday , the little magician could have a rival in years to come			1
hazard is some player , one of the elite in @entity18 football with those dazzling runs and the sparkling feet that can open up the best defences in the league			2
@entity10 has developed into one of the world 's best players after flourishing at @entity2 hazard has proven himself as a goalscorer and a creator of chances during his time with @entity2 hazard celebrates scoring against @entity31 earlier this season as @entity2 march towards the @entity12 title this season he has been imperious , full of movement and flexibility as @entity2 close in on a double of @entity38 and @entity12 in @entity40 's second season back at @entity41			1
after @entity2 's 1 - 1 draw with @entity43 in february at the @entity44 , @entity40 demanded more protection from referees for @entity10			1
@entity2 's dancing winger is a marked man			2
the @entity50 young player of the year had been fouled nine times , with @entity53 's team taking it in turns to nobble the @entity56 10 in the first leg of their @entity59 second round tie			0
he has scored some special goals , 17 so far with another nine assists , as @entity40 's team close in on a fourth @entity12 title in the @entity65 era			1
on sunday , april 26 the @entity50 players ' player of the year award could be his , joining a list of winners that includes @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and his @entity2 team - mate @entity75 in recent times			2
he has grown to love @entity18 football , adapting to the demands of the @entity12 and the numerous managers he has already played for since his move from @entity82 in 2012			0
@entity83 was still @entity2 's manager when @entity10 tweeted that he was joining ' this season 's @entity59 winner ' ahead of his £ 32million move from @entity87			1
he made an impressive start in the @entity12 , assisting the opening goal for @entity2 in the 2 - 0 victory at @entity91 and winning the penalty for @entity93 to convert at the @entity94			0
@entity10 joined @entity2 from @entity82 for £ 32million in 2012 after the @entity95 beat a host to clubs to his signature hazard was involved in a controversial incident at @entity101 when he kicked the ball as it lay under the ball boy hazard was sent off after the ball - boy incident as @entity2 were beaten in the @entity38 semi-final hazard , his wife @entity107 and their kids enjoy some off time at @entity111 @entity83 loved him as a player and he went through a notable dip in form when the @entity59 - winning coach was fired after the 4 - 1 defeat against @entity117 in the @entity59			1
a few months later he was sent off when he infamously wrestled with a ball - boy during @entity2 's @entity38 semi-final defeat against @entity101 at the @entity120			2
he finished the season with a @entity123 medal after @entity2 's victory over @entity125 the @entity126 , but it is the arrival of @entity40 that has transformed his game			1
last season there was a period of frustration among @entity2 's first team players because they shared the view of the coach that they had signed a world class talent			0
despite his ability he was often one of the first to leave after training , heading home to his family - wife @entity107 and their two young children , after a quick shower and lunch with his team - mates			0
slowly he has bought into dressing room culture			1
there is a ruthless streak about him these days and @entity40 , to his credit , drew it out of him after meeting @entity10 's father , along with his lawyer , after @entity152 's disappointing @entity151 in @entity153			1
hazard has grown in stature since he was handed @entity158 's old @entity157 shirt , requesting the jersey after the winger left for @entity161 in january 2014			0
the no 10 shirt is also the number of his hero @entity164 , the player a young hazard idolised when he was making his way through @entity168 football before his move to @entity82			2
in recent times he has been encouraged to drift across the front three positions , interchanging with @entity171 ( in the centre ) and @entity173 ( on the right ) when it takes his fancy			0
hazard helped @entity2 win the @entity123 under @entity178 when they beat @entity125 in the final hazard , pictured alongside @entity70 , was named the @entity181 last season @entity10 added a second trophy to his @entity2 collection this season when the @entity95 won the @entity38 @entity40 transformed @entity10 's game after he suffered a dip following the departure of @entity83 @entity40 poses with @entity10 after he was named @entity2 's @entity181 last season he is the focal point of @entity2 's attack , a willing outlet with a first touch that you can melt when he takes it on the instep of his right boot			1
he has been scoring goals again , adding to his tally this season in recent weeks with strikes for club and country as the season hurtles towards the finish line			0
at 24 he is maturing nicely , a humble man who impressed @entity2 's hierarchy during the complex negotiations over a new contract towards the end of last year			0
he has never been responsible for the glut of stories linking him with a move back to @entity87 to play for @entity43 and he consistently told the club that he was willing to remain at @entity41			0
hazard 's contract talks were reminiscent of @entity215 at @entity161 , leaving it with the club to determine the terms on his new five - year contract			0
@entity2 settled on £ 200,000 a week			0
to those who know him , he speaks of trophies and a hunger to be remembered as a player who contributed to one of the most successful periods in @entity2 's history			2
given time , he could even be remembered as the very best			0
hazard recently signed a bumper new five - year deal at @entity2 worth £ 200,000 a week in hazard , @entity0 may soon have a rival as @entity2 's greatest ever player			1

@entity10 will make his 100th league appearance for @entity2 on sunday
the @entity168 's form dipped when @entity83 left the club
but @entity40 's return helped take hazard to another level
