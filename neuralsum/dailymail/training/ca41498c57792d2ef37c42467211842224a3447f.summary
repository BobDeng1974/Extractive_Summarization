announcements : sir @entity1 denied the schools watchdog was full of ' @entity3 , hippy types ' but said those who backed those methods ' would n't be working for me for very long ' the boss of @entity9 has vowed to get rid of education inspectors who back ' trendy child - centred ' teaching methods in light of warnings that such methods damage schoolchildren			1
sir @entity1 denied the schools watchdog was full of ' @entity3 , hippy types ' but said those who backed those methods ' would n't be working for me for very long '			1
the idealogy was popular in the @entity20 and @entity21 and saw children left to work along for long periods of time with little help from teachers - although they were championed at the time for allowing youngsters to work independently			1
he made the comments on @entity30 's today programme yesterday as he revealed full routine inspections of the majority of @entity34 's schools are to be ditched in a major overhaul of the system			1
he said : ' i experienced , when i started teaching in the @entity20 , that sort of ideology which ruined the lives of generations of children at the time '			2
later on he said that inspectors were under instruction to mark down those sort of techniques which he said were ' unstructured ' and ' not teacher - led '			0
under the new plans , around three fifths ( 60 % ) of schools - those rated as ' good ' - will get short visits from one inspector every two to three years			1
full inspections will only be triggered if there are indications that standards at a school have dropped or risen dramatically , sir @entity1 said			1
the move comes amid growing concerns from headteachers and other groups about the current state of the inspections system and the quality of some inspectors			0
the @entity68 ( @entity68 ) has warned that the current system is expensive , unnecessary and ' not very smart ' , while a report published by a think tank earlier this week called for the introduction of a new two - stage inspection process			0
unveiling @entity9 's proposals at @entity68 annual conference in @entity76 , sir @entity1 said that schools rated ' good ' should get ' light - touch ' visits every two to three years by an inspector , or a serving school leader working as an associate inspector			1
the findings of the visit would be shared with parents			0
' at the moment , it can be five years or even more between inspections for a good school , ' sir @entity1 said			1
' this is too long			0
it 's too long for parents			0
it 's too long between inspections to spot decline , and it 's too long for improving schools to show that they are outstanding			2
' far better for an inspector to visit the school for a day than for a full team to descend on the school more infrequently , and then giving , more likely than not , the same judgment as the previous inspection			2
' even if inspectors do find problems in a school , a full visit may not be triggered if the school 's leaders are dealing with the issues properly , sir @entity1 said			1
the changes will be developed over the next 18 months , he revealed , adding that the watchdog is also set to conduct a major review of ' outsourced inspections '			2
overhaul : under the plans , around three fifths ( 60 % ) of schools - those rated as ' good ' - will get short visits from one inspector every two to three years			1
at the moment in can be five years between inspections under the current system , a number of private firms employ inspectors who conduct inspections for @entity9			2
but concerns have been raised about this process and sir @entity1 said that school inspection is too important for @entity9 to just oversee these arrangements			1
the fifth of schools that are rated as outstanding are already exempt from routine inspections , and they will face a similar inspection system to good schools in the future , it was suggested			1
earlier today @entity68 published a new paper calling for the current inspection system to be scrapped in favour of short visits every two to three years by a single experienced inspector			1
it also called for all inspectors to be serving or recently retired school leaders who work directly for @entity9			0
the paper suggests that there should be a standardised schools ' health check ' , supported by a one - day visit from an inspector			2
this check would look at whether a school was successful , if it was improving , if there were areas for improvement which the school could deal with , or whether a full inspection was needed to come up with an action plan for improvement			0
@entity68 president @entity161 , said : ' we need to move away from routine , detailed inspection of successful schools			0
this is expensive and unnecessary and not very smart			0
we can find out a lot about schools without it			0
' these could be replaced with a short school visit by a single inspector every two or three years			2
when problems are identified , a check of the school 's own approach carried out primarily with the school 's leadership , should be the first response			0
' mr @entity161 , who is also head of @entity179 in @entity180 , added : ' only as a last step , and hopefully increasingly rarely , should forensic , ' under the skin ' inspection be needed			0
and when it is , it should be undertaken by a slimmer inspection workforce largely consisting of other appropriately trained school leaders			0
' the proposals come just days after a major report by right - wing think tank @entity190 called for short one - day checks to be made on schools every two years , with detailed ' tailored ' inspections for those that are not up to scratch .			1

sir @entity1 revealed 60 per cent of schools - those rated ' good ' - will get short visits from one inspector every two to three years
full inspections ' triggered if standards have dropped or risen dramatically '
child - centred teaching was popular in the 60s and *70s* and saw children left to work alone for long periods with little help from teachers
