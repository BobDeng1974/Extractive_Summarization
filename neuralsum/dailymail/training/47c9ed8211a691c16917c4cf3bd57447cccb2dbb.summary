in a bid to reinvigorate its range of pcs , @entity0 has unveiled a radical new design complete with a projector and @entity7 cameras			2
called @entity9 , it combines a 23 - inch touchscreen display with an interactive touch mat - in place of a standard keyboard and mouse			1
a projector on top of the monitor scans objects , and it can track a user ’s hands when using a virtual keyboard below			2
the pc is available for pre-order online in the @entity24 , before being released in stores on 9 november , and costs $ 1,899 ( £ 1,180 )			1
more country release dates are yet to be announced			0
the projector , dubbed the @entity34 , is fitted with @entity43 ’s @entity42 technology , similar to @entity45 ’s @entity44 , and combines a @entity47 camera , the projector itself , and an led desk lamp			1
this camera system means it is able to beam images on to the mat , but can also be used to scan physical objects			1
@entity0 's $ 1,899 ( £ 1,180 ) @entity29 has a 23 - inch touchscreen display with an interactive touch mat. a projector is fitted to the top of the monitor , known as the @entity34			1
it is fitted with @entity43 ’s @entity42 technology , similar to @entity45 ’s @entity44 , and combines a @entity47 camera , the projector itself , and an led desk lamp			1
this camera system means it is able to beam images on to the mat , but can also be used to scan physical objects			1
once an object has been scanned , a virtual copy can be manipulated in @entity71 and @entity7 either on the touchscreen , or when beamed onto the mat using a stylus , or typical touchscreen controls such as pinch and swipe			2
users can also type onto the mat using a software - based keyboard because the cameras recognise 20 touches at one time			1
@entity9 runs on @entity85 , is powered by @entity43 ’s i7 processor and comes with @entity88 storage			1
once an object has been scanned , a virtual copy can be manipulated in @entity71 and @entity7 either on the touchscreen , or on the mat , using a stylus , or touchscreen controls such as pinch and swipe			0
during the launch event , @entity0 executives demonstrated how various items from pens and cups to figurines and pictures can be scanned , tacked onto existing images or video , edited then emailed or shared through social media			0
and when a virtual keyboard is beamed onto the mat , the cameras can also track the location of fingers to plot what they type using its 20 - point capacitive sensors			1

‘ we 've been working for a number of years already			0
' we have patents going back more than 10 years , ’ said project chief @entity117			0
‘ we did n't want to introduce a product that was n't a breakthrough			0
’ @entity120 , project leader , said the initial production run ‘ will be modest but can be scaled up if needed ’			0
he said the key would be to attract developers for a new @entity124 or apps store , for software that takes advantage of @entity9 's 3d capabilities			2
@entity9 will launch with apps from @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132			0
more will be added later			0
‘ it 's about getting people excited again , ’ said mr @entity133			0

this camera system means it is able to beam images on to the mat , but can also be used to scan physical objects additional country releases will be announced shortly			1
in a departure for the company , @entity0 also announced it will begin to share its 3d printing technology			2
the technique , which the company claims can print 10 times faster and much cheaper than current products , will be shared with select manufacturing and technology partners to garner feedback before launching in 2016			0
the company calls its technique ‘ multi jet fusion ’ because it uses a series of printing jets spraying multiple chemicals simultaneously			0
it also claims it is cheaper than other commercially available technologies			0
once an object has been scanned , a virtual copy can be manipulated in @entity71 and @entity7 either on the touchscreen , or on the mat ( pictured ) using a stylus , or touchscreen controls such as pinch and swipe			0
users can also type onto the mat using a software - based keyboard because the cameras recognise 20 touches at one time			1

@entity0 ’s sprout has a 23 - inch touchscreen display with an interactive touch mat
a projector uses a 3d camera to scan objects directly into the pc
images can then be beamed , and interacted with , on the mat
users can also type onto the mat using a software - based keyboard
@entity9 runs on @entity85 and is powered by @entity43 's i7 processor
it launches in the @entity24 on 9 november , and costs $ 1,899 ( £ 1,180 )
