the @entity14 champions have slipped seven points behind @entity16 in the title race ahead of wednesday ’s trip to @entity19 , and have failed to win any of their last five game in all competitions			1
it represents @entity2 ’s worst run since late 2009 when current @entity19 boss @entity24 was sacked at the @entity25			1
under - fire @entity2 manager @entity0 insists he is n't feeling the pressure at the club @entity28 rescued @entity0 's side with a late free - kick at the @entity25 @entity0 ’s future could hinge on how his team perform against @entity33 in the @entity34 , but the @entity35 remained a picture of calm at his pre-match press conference on tuesday			1
he said : ‘ i do n’t feel any pressure from inside the club or from outside			1
‘ i never feel pressure			2
it has been the same the last two years , the only pressure is my own pressure – the pressure i make on myself when i do n’t think the team is playing well			2
‘ we are in a normal position , we ’re involved in the @entity34 , if we win on wednesday i think we are just one point less than last season			2
we have a lot more important things to think about than pressure			0
’ @entity0 confirmed that @entity52 and new £ 28million signing @entity53 will arrive back in @entity54 later in the week after helping @entity55 lift the @entity56 in @entity57 , although @entity2 are not involved in the @entity58 this weekend			1

we have also @entity79 , we have @entity80 , we have @entity81 , we have @entity82			0
we have a lot of players that always score			0
‘ the players have different moments during the season			0
if you remember , at the beginning of the season , everyone asked why @entity52 continued playing			0
after that it was a team that was only ( relying ) on @entity81 and without @entity81 it was impossible to play			0
when @entity81 was n’t fit , we continue winning all the games			0
now he is coming back and all of us are expecting that he will recover his normal performance			0
‘ @entity19 are always a very difficult team , especially playing at the @entity67			2
it is a difficult team for us because last season we just won here 1 - 0 and we drew there 0 - 0 so in every moment it is difficult			1
