@entity0 said the so - called ‘ citizens income ’ – which critics say would cost £ 280billion – would take longer than five years to bring in , and could take even longer every adult in @entity5 would be paid £ 72 a week under a commitment in the @entity8 manifesto – but the party leader admitted her pledges could take decades to implement			1
@entity0 said the so - called ‘ citizens income ’ – which critics say would cost £ 280billion – would take longer than five years to bring in , and could take even longer			1
she said another @entity13 pledge – to dismantle the @entity14 and use weapons factories to build wind turbines – was also a ‘ long - term aspiration ’			2
and the party ’s policy of leaving @entity20 and abandoning nuclear weapons was ‘ many decades into the future ’			2
the revelations came in another disappointing performance by @entity25 , when she was interviewed on the @entity28 4 today programme			2
in february she suffered what she called a ‘ brain fade ’ on @entity35 when she forgot the details of her party ’s key housing policies			1
on today , she was challenged about policies listed in the @entity13 policy book , which is set by party members at the annual conference			1
one of these is the citizens ’ incomes , which would be given to everyone in @entity5 as a ‘ right of citizenship ’ , regardless of wealth or whether they are seeking work			2
miss @entity0 , the @entity48 leader in @entity49 and @entity50 , said the policy would take time to implement			1
she said : ‘ let me say this very slowly – the commitment is in the manifesto			2
we do n’t think we can introduce it in the term of the next parliament ; it ’s a big change			0
‘ the @entity48 has a long - term vision about what @entity5 should look like			1
i do n’t apologise for that			0
‘ we are saying we need a @entity5 that ’s built on principles of politics ; we need a different kind of politics and having that long - term vision , looking into the future and saying what should @entity5 look like in five , 10 , 20 years ’ time is something that is very much central to @entity48 politics			1
’ claiming the citizens ’ income was backed by an ‘ increasing number of economists ’ , she said that as ‘ the sixth richest economy , we have to provide for everyone 's basic needs and we have to do that within the limits of our one planet ’			1
‘ @entity83 , the commitment to that , is in this manifesto – but we 've seen the difficulties that @entity88 has got into in introducing @entity89 , so we 're saying it would take more than the term of one parliament to actually introduce this , ’ she said			0
claiming the citizens ’ income was backed by an ‘ increasing number of economists ’ , ms @entity0 said that as ‘ the sixth richest economy , we have to provide for everyone 's basic needs and we have to do that within the limits of our one planet ’ after two - and - a - half years as @entity48 leader , @entity0 would have liked to think she has made a name for herself			1
but after another faltering media performance she suffered the indignity of being confused with her predecessor			0
radio 4 today presenter @entity103 ended the grilling saying : @entity105 , thank you very much			1
' he quickly apologised for his gaffe			0
ms @entity105 was @entity8 leader from 2008 - 12 , but stood down to concentrate on being the party 's first mp			1
miss @entity0 was also challenged over a pledge , contained in the same policy book , to dismantle the @entity14 – saying it was a ‘ long - term ’ aspiration			0
she also said that abandoning nuclear weapons and leaving @entity20 was a ‘ long - term plan many decades into the future ’			1
the book also contains pledges to legalise the sex industry and drug use , decriminalise @entity122 membership and impose new taxes on pop music performances and large gifts			0
miss @entity0 said the @entity126 were now the third - largest party in @entity49 and @entity50			0
‘ we 're larger than @entity128 , we 're larger than the @entity129 , ’ she said			0
‘ we have more than 58,000 members			0
‘ we 've had one green mp , @entity105 , who 's had a huge impact as one mp in the @entity132			2
‘ and we 're now working very hard to send a strong group of @entity134 to @entity132 who - given the electoral arithmetic - have a very good chance of being in a strong position to really influence the whole direction of the next government			0
’ she said her party offered a ‘ genuine alternative ’ to the @entity144 ' ‘ austerity heavy ’ and the @entity146 's ‘ austerity - lite ’			0
@entity8 ’ manifesto will be launched next week .			0
