perfect pitch may be part of the genetic programming of certain individuals , a study suggests			1
scientists believe nature as well as nurture can help gifted singers hit the right note			0
people with perfect pitch have the ability to sing any note at precisely the right frequency without a reference tone to guide them			1
@entity15 - given gift ? a new study suggests the ability to sing in perfect pitch may be part of the genetic programming of certain individuals perfect , or absolute , pitch is extremely rare , but more common among speakers of tonal languages , such as @entity22 , who have musical training			1
although a link has been seen between learning music and perfect pitch , most people lack the ability even with musical training			1
to investigate it is acquired or innate , @entity30 scientists studied 27 @entity33 - speaking adults including seven with the gift			1
all began extensive musical training before the age of six			0
absolute pitch , widely referred to as perfect pitch , is the ability of a person to identify or re-create a given musical note without the benefit of an external reference like a notes from a piano keyboard			1
people who possess absolute pitch have it in varying degrees			0
generally , absolute pitch implies some or all of the following abilities : participants were given a standard memory test which involved recalling a series of numbers in correct order			2
in two versions of the ' digit test ' , numbers were either presented visually or spoken over headphones			0
individuals with perfect pitch far outperformed the others in the audio test , while the two groups were evenly matched when recalling numbers on a screen			2
the finding is significant because previous research has shown there is a genetic component to speech memory			0
study leader professor @entity72 , from the @entity73 , said : ' we have wondered if perfect pitch is as much about nature or nurture			2
' what is clear is that musically trained individuals who speak a non-tone language can acquire absolute pitch , but it is still a remarkably rare talent			0
' what has been less clear is why most others with equivalent musical training do not			0
' our finding therefore shows that perfect pitch is associated with an unusually large memory span for speech sounds , which in turn could facilitate the development of associations between pitches and their spoken languages early in life			1
' the research was presented today at the annual meeting of the @entity96 in @entity97 , @entity98 .			0

@entity30 scientists ' findings show perfect pitch is associated with unusually large memory span for speech sounds
