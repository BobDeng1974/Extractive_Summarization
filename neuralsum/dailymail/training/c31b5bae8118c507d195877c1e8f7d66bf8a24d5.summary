a new @entity9 survey puts @entity4 on just 33 per cent , two points behind the @entity11 , and the lowest levels of support since the weeks after @entity14 quit after being ousted from @entity15			1
to add to mr @entity1 's woes , senior @entity4 figures rounded on his plans for a mansion tax , as @entity20 mocked him for forgetting the deficit in his conference speech			1
he omitted any mention of the deficit and failed to refer to how he might tackle immigration to @entity39			2
it was followed by a successful conservative party conference , during which @entity42 garnered positive headlines for his promise of a tax cut for 30million workers			1
reports have emerged of a plot to replace mr @entity1 with the more down - to - earth ex-postman @entity49 , while shadow health secretary @entity50 is said to be positioning as a leadership challenger			1
the latest in a series of @entity9 studies putting the @entity54 ahead has @entity4 on only 33 per cent , the party 's lowest figure with the pollster since june 2010 , before mr @entity1 's election as leader			1
the poll for the @entity61 put the @entity11 on 35 per cent , @entity4 on 33 per cent , @entity62 on 13 per cent and the @entity63 on 8 per cent			1
mr @entity1 has pinned his hopes of becoming prime minister on a promise of £ 2.5billion for the @entity67 , funded in part by a levy imposed on homes worth more than £ 2million			0
@entity4 's shadow chancellor @entity20 mocked mr @entity1 for forgetting to mention the deficit in his speech however , there is growing criticism from within the @entity4 about the mansion tax policy			1
@entity76 , chairman of the powerful @entity77 , told the @entity78 it was ' too crude to work properly '			2
she said : ' i do n't think it 's the world 's most sensible idea			2
we need to tackle the idea that people are shielding their money in @entity86 through properties			0
' the problem identified is the right one ; i just think the solution is too crude to work properly			0
' and former cabinet minister @entity90 told the newspaper : ' i am concerned about typically older families who are asset - rich and income - poor			2
' they bought houses 40 years ago , which have appreciated enormously in value , and they certainly ca n't afford a mansion tax			1
' the important thing is we set out how it will be applied and the fairness test that will apply			0
' one of @entity4 's biggest individual donors , @entity103 founder @entity102 , told the @entity104 the mansion tax could push people into negative equity			1
' the problem with the mansion tax - apart from issues of whether it 's fair or going to work - is it requires really tricky valuations , ' he said			1
' it 's a step from zero to some quite large number which is going to produce all sorts of problems on the boundary			0
' if people have got mortgages , they could get into negative equity			0
there are these sort of problems as well			0
' the @entity11 and @entity63 have repeatedly mocked mr @entity1 's failure to mention the deficit in his speech			1
@entity128 jokes last week : ' his subconscious rebelled			0
the baggage handlers in his memory went on strike – as they would under a @entity4 government – and refused to load the word deficit on to the conveyor belt of his tongue			0
' senior @entity4 figures including @entity90 ( left ) and @entity76 have publicly criticised mr @entity1 's mansion tax plans now mr @entity20 , @entity4 's shadow chancellor , has joined the chorus of criticism , revealing he was ' surprised ' that mr @entity1 had forgotten the economic section of his keynote conference speech			1
he told @entity145 's @entity144 : ' well i had seen the speech a couple of weeks ago so it 's one of those things where sometimes in life you can forget the most important things			2
in that speech , not talking about the deficit			2
' he added : ' i knew what was in the speech and therefore i was surprised momentarily			0
i was surprised , but we are where we are			0
it 's a really hard thing to stand up and make big speeches like that and do it from memory			0
' i think if he could do the speech again it would be in			0
i think he was as annoyed by it as anybody would be			0
' it comes after the @entity4 leader was accused by party grandee @entity172 of showing a severe lack of ambition in a damning assessment of his ' far too timid ' strategy and underwhelming conference performance			2
prominent @entity4 donors also raised concerns over the weekend , with lord noon , one of the party 's significant individual benefactors , saying the party ' really need to buck up ' and @entity186 , who was @entity188 's chief fundraiser , criticising the tax plans as ' totally inappropriate ' .			1
