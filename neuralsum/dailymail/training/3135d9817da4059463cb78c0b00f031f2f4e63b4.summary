by @entity0 published : 14:16 est , 31 january 2014 updated : 17:58 est , 31 january 2014 @entity2 has spoken out against the superficial scrutiny given to the @entity4 and hopes the eventual @entity4 is given the same treatment			1
she said that while she thinks too much attention is paid to a first lady 's hair and make up , ' i do n't think we can get around it '			1
' maybe when we finally have a first gentleman			0
and maybe we should be that way about the first gentleman also , and really critique the way they look all the timeâ € ” their choice of tie or their hairstyle or whatever			0
or maybe their weight , ' she said			0
looking back : former first lady @entity2 said that the first spouse should ' stand back and be quiet ' ' it 'll be interesting when it finally happens what the @entity4 will do			1
i hope they take on men 's health perhaps , ' she said , making an underhanded slight at the pattern of initiatives that are seen as ' appropriate ' for @entity4 to handle falls mostly in the realm of women 's and children 's health			1
mrs @entity2 was interviewed by @entity40 as part of their ongoing series of interviews with former @entity4			2
in the clips released ahead of the full program , which will air on march 2 , mrs @entity2 dismissed the theory that those married to the president should receive a salary			1
' i do n't think so			2
there are plenty of perks , believe me ! ' she said			0
' a chef , that was really great ! i miss the chef			0
highlight : mrs @entity2 said that one of her favorite moments during her husband 's terms was when she unexpectantly took over the speech at the @entity61 in 2005 ' i think the interesting question really is not should they receive a salary but should they be able to work for a salary at their job that they might have already had and i think that 's what we 'll have to come to terms with			1
' certainly a first gentlemen might continue to work at whatever he did - if he was a lawyer or whatever he did			0
so i think that 's really the question she should ask is should she have a career in those years that her husband is president in addition to serving as first lady			1
' she talks at length about questions of protocol that will arise when a woman is elected president and her husband is given the title of @entity4 - but does n't once mention the most likely candidate : former president @entity90			1
she did have one key piece of advice for any first spouse , however			0
breaking the mold : in her interview , mrs @entity2 never explicitly names @entity90 as the potential ' @entity4 ' but he seems like the most likely candidate ( with the @entity98 and mrs @entity2 seen here at a 2004 event at the @entity61 ) ' stand back and be quiet , ' she said with a smile			1
mrs @entity2 is just the latest to be featured in the ongoing series , and her mother - in - law 's turn came out earlier this month			0
in it , the elder mrs @entity2 said that while she ' loves ' @entity90 but not his politics			0
if she had her way , neither her son @entity107 nor @entity108 would run for the @entity61 in 2016 - even though they are among the most likely candidates for their respective parties			2
' i think this is a great @entity114 country , a great country , and if we ca n't find more than two or three families to run for high office that 's silly because there are great governors and great eligible people to run , ' she said in a new interview			2
' i think the @entity122 , @entity98 , @entity123 - there are just more families than that			0
' twice is enough : @entity128 said that should her younger son @entity107 decide to run for president in 2016 , that would be pushing the amount of time that one family had been in the @entity61			2

former first lady also said that the president 's spouse should not receive a salary for their work while in the @entity61
said that too much attention is paid to the @entity4 's looks but ' i do n't think we can get around it '
