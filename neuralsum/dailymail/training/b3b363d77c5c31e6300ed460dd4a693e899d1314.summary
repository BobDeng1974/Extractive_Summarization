by @entity0 published : 09:30 est , 23 august 2013 updated : 09:34 est , 23 august 2013 a new investigation has lifted the lid on the global fashion industry dynamics that make designer swimsuits so expensive			1
every summer women in changing rooms around the country wonder why they feel compelled to pay hundreds of dollars for a suit that covers just a few inches of skin			0
but designer @entity11 explains to @entity12 that engineering a swimsuit is every bit as challenging as a shirt or dress			1
quality over quantity : high - end designers claim that their more expensive pieces such as the $ 203 @entity22 bikini modeled by @entity23 , are justified because they use better material and tailoring ' it can take up to five machines to make one swimsuit and the fabric costs the same amount as clothing fabric , ' she says			1
swimsuits are like lingerie - except that , unlike underwear , designers also have to make sure that it holds up while running into waves and jumping off diving boards			1
creating a garment that looks great and stands up to salt , sand and chlorine presents additional design challenges			0
' we ’re working on a small canvas , so it ’s more challenging to create a suit that feels good and … is innovative and fashion - forward , ' swimwear designer @entity45 tells @entity51			1
anecdotal evidence suggests that cheap swimsuits fall apart after one season , while higher - priced ones are built to last			2
but is this true ? celebrity fans : @entity57 ( left , pictured in august 2013 ) is a fan of @entity11 while @entity58 ( right , pictured in 2010 ) is often spotted in @entity60 bikinis ' the fabric in high end swimwear lasts , ' ms @entity11 says			2
' a lot of cheap swimwear companies either do n't line [ swimsuits ] , or do a straight stitch , which is faster to sew			1
' she adds : ' we do self lining which means the outside fabric is the same as the inside lining , and use very expensive hardware that goes through testing to make sure it does not change			0
' ' a lot of cheap swimwear companies either do n't line swimsuits , or do a straight stitch , which is faster to sew ' then there is the spandex factor			1
the stretchy staple fabric remains more expensive than , for example , the sturdy nylon or cotton used in men ’s swimwear			2
and smaller designers ca n't negotiate the same bulk manufacturer discounts as discount megastores like @entity90 and @entity91			2
but when shopping strictly based on fabric it can tough to spot the difference between the low and high end bikinis - especially when shopping online			0
@entity97 's black bikini , priced at $ 330 has a triangle top made of 85per cent polyamide , and 15per cent elastane - which are fancy @entity101 words for ' nylon ' and ' spandex '			2
the briefs have a ratio of 82 to 18per cent			0
ready for her close - up : supermodel @entity109 was pictured earlier this month wearing a @entity111 bikini that retails for around $ 360 bargain bikini : beyonce models a black bikini from @entity91 , where the majority of swimsuit separates are priced at under $ 20 contrast this with @entity90 's @entity121 triangle bikini , priced at $ 9.98 for the top and $ 13.98 for the bottom - also also constructed from 82per cent nylon and 18per cent spandex			1
according to the @entity124 , the global swimwear industry is now worth $ 13.25 billion annually , and the average @entity126 woman owns four swimsuits			1
but smaller labels may only have a short window of time to get the garments manufactured and shipped back to the @entity132 to make a sale , which also adds to production costs			0
' i think being in a swimsuit is daunting enough - women want to feel confident that everything will be held in place , lifted and not loose ' marshal @entity140 , chief fashion analyst at the @entity124 , told the @entity141 that selling bikini tops and bottoms separately , rather than as a matched set , is more expensive for designers			1
' a fifty dollar suit has become a seventy dollar suit , ' he said			0
as with couture clothes , shoppers are a high - end designer 's expertise - and because they believe that feeling beautiful on the beach is worth the investment			0
' i think being in a swimsuit or a bikini is daunting enough and women want to feel confident that everything will be held in place , lifted and not loose , ' ms @entity11 says			0
' it 's well worth spending on good quality , [ and ] it will be actually cheaper in the long run			0

the global swimwear industry is now worth $ 13.25 billion annually , and the average @entity126 woman owns four swimsuits
designers say that engineering a tiny swimsuit is more complex than a dress
