what a difference a week makes			2
this @entity3 team , through getting selection right , have become a team that anybody involved in sport should look forward to watching			1
the @entity8 game is one @entity3 are going to win , but i want to see them set even higher standards than we saw against @entity13 , based on the quality of player they have			1
@entity3 ’s first game in the @entity18 is against @entity19 and i want them to use this game today to replicate that fixture , when they ’ll need to not only win but win well			1
@entity25 centre @entity23 rises high to claim a high ball during @entity3 's captain 's run on friday @entity3 scrum half @entity29 ( left ) will be looking to inject pace and tempo into his side 's attack @entity35 gets through some kicking practice at @entity37 ahead of the clash with @entity8 on saturday last year ’s @entity39 came down to points difference and it could be the same this year			1
but of far more relevance is that , with @entity43 and @entity13 in @entity3 ’s @entity18 pool , that group could come down to points difference as well			1
and i do not think @entity3 can win the @entity18 unless they win their group because their route to the final will be so much more difficult if they finish runners - up			1
i want @entity3 to challenge themselves ( a ) to concede zero points and ( b ) set themselves a target of scoring a drop goal and three tries in each half			1
@entity3 should be challenging themselves to push towards 50 points			1
based on what we saw in their opening game against @entity61 this is one of the poorest @entity64 sides i can remember in the @entity39 , which is a great shame for the tournament			0
my belief that the next game is all that matters has not changed			0
but @entity70 , as head coach , still needs to consider the direction and growth of his team			1
this is a great way to ensure they are still under pressure			0
@entity78 flanker @entity77 has added massive physicality and dynamism to the @entity3 back row @entity61 turned in an acceptable performance in a wet @entity83 last weekend			1
but in front of a @entity37 crowd which will be buzzing after last week ’s win , @entity3 should demand more			1
i will be disappointed if they do not come out with the attitude that they ’re going to put @entity8 to the sword			2
i was so impressed by @entity3 in @entity91			2
it was a landmark win			0
the difference the likes of @entity95 , @entity23 , @entity77 and @entity35 have made to the conservative , defensive - minded @entity3 we have seen is brilliant			1
this is the best @entity3 team we have seen since 2003			2
it does not matter how it happened , it is there now and @entity101 should be roundly applauded			0
saturday ’s game , at home , will be a different challenge			2
people expect @entity3 to win convincingly and that brings a different pressure			2
@entity3 need to play with pace and put speed on the ball and challenge themselves to maintain a level of performance all the way through			1
i expect @entity3 to start well but can they finish each half at full tilt ? @entity3 coaches @entity70 ( left ) , @entity117 ( centre ) and @entity119 watch on at training i remember in 2003 when we played @entity8 at @entity37			1
we ripped them to pieces in the first half and racked up 40 points — but then proceeded to turn in one of the worst second - half performances i can remember on my watch			2
we finished the game feeling flat even though we still won easily			0
it was a huge eye - opener			0
@entity70 ’s team need to be ruthless today			2
i ’ve never doubted this group of players and i ’m delighted with how the coaching team are growing			0
this was illustrated by the control @entity3 had in the second half in @entity91 , which is so important in test rugby			1
@entity3 are overwhelming favourites today but @entity8 will raise their level of performance and it ’s vital @entity3 up their level too			1
they need to set themselves objectives			0
can they concede zero points ? can they score tries from different parts of the pitch ? @entity147 celebrates his try during @entity61 's 26 - 3 victory against @entity8 in @entity83 last saturday @entity70 should challenge his starting xv to stay on the field for as long as possible			1
players should be lifted out of their comfort zones			0
@entity8 will kick a lot and i would challenge the back three to launch counter-attacks and resist the up and under			1
@entity29 should avoid the box kick			1
he and the loose forwards should tap and go from their own half , keeping up the tempo			2
@entity23 will have a day to remember on his @entity37 debut and , if @entity3 play at pace with a real determination to score tries , it will be a great day to wear the no 13 jersey			1
they showed in @entity91 some potent attacking potential and , though a year ago the coaches would have worried about their defensive frailties , they know now these guys raise their defensive game in the international arena			2
@entity172 can make a huge impact from the bench if he is called upon against the @entity8 @entity175 was terrific against @entity13			1
he did n’t look flustered at all			0
i ’m not even sure he broke sweat			0
it was a really telling last kick under pressure , but i ’m also really happy they have @entity172 on the bench again because he is a similar player whose mindset is to attack			0
having that affects the rest of the team and @entity175 has the chance now to cement his place			0
i ’d like to see the coaches stick with this side			0
i ’ve no doubt this week ’s training will have been fantastic			0
the win will have reinforced the mindset among the coaches that what they are doing is right and the players will be walking taller , feeling arrogance in a positive way			0
you ca n’t understate how important @entity91 was			0
now they can look forward to a really good @entity39 and a good @entity18 with a battle - hardened group of players and a forward pack that can go head - to - head with any side in the world			0
that game will stay with them as a defining game of 2015			0
they must build on that today			0
@entity3 have a chance of a lifetime coming up			2
they need to take it .			0

@entity3 should challenge themselves to score a drop goal and three tries in each half against @entity8
@entity70 's side should be aiming to score 50 points
@entity95 , @entity23 , @entity77 and @entity35 have made a huge difference to @entity3 's attacking play
@entity29 should avoid the box kick and inject tempo into the game
