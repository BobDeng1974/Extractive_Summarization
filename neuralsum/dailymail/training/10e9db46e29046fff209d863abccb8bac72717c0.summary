@entity0 believes @entity1 is on course to become a top - class @entity4 striker as he continues to develop his eye for goal			1
the @entity8 manager admits @entity1 is a natural winger but has tasked him with being the focal point of the attack as @entity0 continues to tweak his side to replicate the goalscoring feats they achieved last season			1
after scoring three times in his last three games , including the winner against @entity18 on @entity19 , @entity0 believes that @entity1 's work rate and willingness to learn are the key factors in a so far seamless transformation			1
some are not so worried about what they do in the build - up , not concerned about how hard they work , but they want to score a goal			2
they have that ability to get a goal			2
' then you get other players , the top - class players who work very hard , who have that ability to score a lot of goals and create goals and that 's something that develops with confidence over your career			2
i think we see him like that and i think his numbers over his career will keep improving and improving			2
' for me i 'm very happy with his performance			0
he 's gone into that role , he 's offered us a real threat , his pace in every game is phenomenal but he 's got that bit of composure at the end			0
he 's going to miss some chances of course but you 've seen at @entity18 the one opportunity he had he took it			0
' @entity1 takes on @entity18 defender @entity68 as he was deployed up front at @entity70 @entity1 celebrates after he rounded @entity18 goalkeeper @entity71 to give @entity8 the lead @entity1 has big shoes to fill as he bids to compensate for the absence of @entity75			1
in his relatively short career to date , @entity1 has only reached double figures once , last season			1
stepping up could be seen as a big ask for a player who has only just turned 20 years old , but his manager has every confidence he can stand up to the weight of expectation			2
' he deals with it so well but it 's hard to hide the talent , ' @entity0 added			1
' if you have that talent you 're going to be under that scrutiny and we protect the players as much as we can			0
' i 've seen him develop into a wonderful young man			0
he 's got great maturity			0
i think back to the boy when i arrived here when he was 17 and i see him now and the maturity that he has and how he 's taken it all in his stride			0
of course he 's had difficult moments but as i said he 's a real pleasure to work with			0
@entity8 manager @entity0 ( right ) was full of praise for @entity1 ' he obviously realises the harder you climb the ladder people want to criticise you more as well but that 's all part of the dance			1
i 'm delighted to work with him and hopefully we can be together for a long time			2
' @entity8 close the first half of their campaign on sunday as they welcome @entity110 to @entity111			1
a win would see them draw level on points with the visitors , although the @entity118 side possess a superior goal difference			0
as they bid to close the gap on the @entity123 places , @entity0 hopes that an improved second half of the season can see them fulfil their pre-season ambitions			1
@entity0 said : ' for us the objectives are very much the same - we want to finish in that top four			1
we know there 's a long road but the points can whittle away very quickly			0
we 're seven points behind that but we 'll take each game as it comes and if we can keep this momentum going and keep the focus we can have a real good second half to the season			0

@entity1 has scored three in three playing up front for @entity8
@entity144 star has been moved up front with @entity75 injured
manager @entity0 says @entity1 is improving all the time up front
