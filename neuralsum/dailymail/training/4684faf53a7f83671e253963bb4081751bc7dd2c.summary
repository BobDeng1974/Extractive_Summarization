by @entity0 follow @ @ laura_mail @entity1 had earlier won gold to retain her 400m individual medley title , executing a brilliant tactical and gutsy display to surge past @entity6 's @entity5 in the final 100m			1
the @entity8 sprang a surprise by going out quickly and leading after the butterfly , normally one of her weaker disciplines , but @entity5 hit back during the backstroke and remained five hundredths of a second ahead as the pair turned after the breaststroke			2
what happened next was so different two years ago at @entity19 , when @entity1 was heavily tipped to win a medal on the opening day in the pool but was blown away into fifth position by @entity25 16 - year - old sensation @entity24			1
there were tears of a very different kind that day and , you sense , a determination to make sure she never felt like that again			0
@entity49 , 79 , is the oldest member of @entity6 , yet took up bowling relatively recently : in 1997 , aged 62			2
that showed itself last night as petite 5ft 5in smiley @entity1 powered past @entity5 in the final 100m , her freestyle allowing her to smash her own @entity65 record with a time of 4mins 31.76secs			1
she covered the last 50m in just 31.21secs			0
@entity69 denied @entity1 the honour of winning @entity36 's first gold medal at these games as she claimed victory in the under 48kg class shortly before 7pm			1
but the honour of hearing ' @entity76 ' inside @entity77 for the first time belonged to @entity1			2
she did not seem to know whether to sing , cry or smile on the podium , and who could blame her ; such was the maelstrom of emotion swelling around this intimate arena			0
@entity1 's father @entity84 , a former solider who works as a helicopter pilot as well as coaching his daughter , broke down in tears and was the first family member to give @entity1 a hug as she embarked on a lengthy lap of honour , draped in the @entity36 flag			2
proud : @entity1 takes a lap of honour around the pool draped in the @entity36 flag no 1 : @entity1 leaps out of the water after successfully defending her @entity33 title magic moment : @entity1 beams as the bagpipes are played during her medal ceremony @entity33 off to thrilling start & medal table @entity1 said : ' that was just incredible			1
it ’s just amazing to get that time and show that the hard work has paid off			0
‘ me and my @entity106 have done so much			0
we ’ve gone against the grain and it ’s been a tough year			0
‘ i ’ve had my scalp taken a couple of times and i ’ve had to stop , take stock and ask : “ is it really working ? am i going in the right direction ? ” ‘ but i totally trust the work that my @entity106 has done and it has just all worked – thankfully			0
’ @entity6 's @entity116 , only 18 years old , won silver in the 200m freestyle and @entity119 earned bronze in the 400m freestyle .			1

@entity1 successfully defends the title she won in @entity124 in 2010
she finished with a @entity65 - record time of four minutes and 31.76 seconds
@entity6 's @entity5 finished in second
@entity54 's @entity41 came away with the bronze medal
