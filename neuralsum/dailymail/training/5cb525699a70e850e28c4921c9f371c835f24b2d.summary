@entity0 declared that @entity1 are making progress despite slumping to a series defeat following @entity5 's 28 - 27 victory at the @entity6			1
the rivals produced three tries apiece in a breathtaking second test in @entity10 but it was a devastating third - quarter spell that enabled the @entity5 to extend their triumphant run to 16 matches			1
@entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 crossed to establish a 28 - 13 lead after @entity1 had entered the interval 10 - 6 up , a scoreline which failed to fully reward their dominant first half			1
agonising : @entity20 ( right ) and @entity1 lost both matches narrowly to give @entity5 the series positives : @entity1 head coach @entity0 ( left ) and @entity24 ( right ) remain upbeat despite defeat @entity26 darted over in the 72nd minute to offer hope of a fightback that quickly faded and @entity29 's injury - time try merely offered pride in defeat			1
' we 're disappointed to have come away with nothing having worked so hard			0
we put ourselves in a position to win after the first half , ' @entity0 said			2
' we have high expectations on this tour and having lost the first game so narrowly we wanted to level the series and take it to a decider in @entity41			2
' but they are high - quality opposition and after another week together you could see the improved cohesion in their performance			1
' there were one or two errors in our game which presented them with opportunities , but overall the positives far outweigh the negatives			0
' overall i felt the backline created a lot of opportunities as a group			0
the frustration for us is not finishing the opportunities			0
try : all black centre @entity16 ( centre ) races away to score one of three @entity5 tries close : @entity66 scored the first of @entity1 's three consolation tries against @entity5 ' scoring three tries in @entity10 is not a bad return so we are moving in the right direction but still , we did n't quite finish the deal			1
' it 's decision - making at the highest level that we need to look at and that 's probably the next step we need to take with the team			2
' @entity1 were magnificent in the first half and established an early 10 - 0 lead through @entity66 's try and five points from @entity81			1
@entity66 's pace and strength troubled the @entity5 , as did @entity85 ' distribution and vision , but the tourists ' dominance was not reflected on the scoreboard			1
and when @entity5 eased through the gears in a clinical 11 - minute spell started when @entity85 gave the ball away , enabling the magnificent @entity14 to score , they had cantered out of sight			1
' we were pushing the pace in the first half and in the second half the @entity5 showed why they 're the world champions , ' defence coach @entity24 said			1
' their speed of thought and the speed at which they played the game was outstanding			0
defeat : @entity1 captain @entity104 looks dejected following the 2 - 0 series loss to @entity5 fierce : @entity5 perform the @entity106 before the second test against @entity1 in @entity10 ' their core skills are excellent as well			1
that we got ourselves back into the game when we could have conceded a barrage of points says everything about us			0
' the experiment of playing @entity20 on the wing was unsuccessful on this occasion with the @entity119 , who was tackled by @entity14 just short of the line after a 60 - metre run , failing to make an impact			2
when asked whether he would persevere with @entity20 in the number 14 jersey , @entity0 said : ' we 'll wait and see really , we 'll have to assess the game			2
we wo n't make the decision until wednesday			0
' @entity5 head coach @entity127 celebrated an important series triumph over an @entity1 team he rates highly			1
tough : @entity1 's @entity85 ( second left ) competes in the air with all black @entity131 ( second right ) tackle : @entity16 ( left ) tries to evade the grasps of @entity134 ( centre ) and @entity136 ( second right ) ' we certainly played better than in the first test but we needed to because @entity1 were a lot better too			1
it was a great test match , ' @entity127 said			2
' the ball was thrown around and everyone would have left satisfied with what they saw			0
' any series win is important for us			0
there 's still another game to go and there 's been nothing in it in the first two games			0
' we 're playing one of the best sides in the world and managing to come out on the right side of the result			0
' we 're learning about ourselves and about @entity1 , so that is useful information			0
' @entity1 have always been a team we enjoy playing , particularly of late because they 've been real contests			0
they 're right up there			0

@entity5 ' win gives them an *unassailable* 2 - 0 lead in three - match series
@entity0 said he could see the ' improved cohesion in the performance '
defence coach @entity24 *praises* @entity5 's ' core skills '
@entity66 , @entity26 and @entity29 scored for @entity1
@entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 with @entity5 tries
the third and final test will take place in @entity41 next *saturday*
