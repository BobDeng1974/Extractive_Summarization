exiles from @entity2 's communist revolution are fighting for the right to seize billions of dollars of @entity2 money held in frozen @entity6 bank accounts			1
@entity8 , 78 , and the families of fellow @entity2 @entity10 and @entity11 , an @entity6 , each won separate lawsuits in @entity13 seeking billions of dollars in damages from the @entity2 government			1
the fight now , though , is less with @entity2 than it is with the banks where the @entity18 froze @entity2 government assets that the families now want to seize			0
@entity2 exile @entity8 , 78 , in an interview in his lawyer 's office in @entity24			1
he and the families of two men allegedly killed by @entity2 are moving closer to collecting billions of dollars linked to the @entity2 regime the banks are resisting turning the money over , insisting the @entity6 families have yet to prove they should be allowed to seize it			1
mr @entity8 has been an avowed enemy of the @entity2 government since the day in 1959 that , he says , agents of the communist regime blackmailed his father into committing suicide			1
his anti-castro missions have included co-piloting a b - 26 bomber during the ill - fated 1961 @entity38 as well as infiltrating @entity2 for the @entity39 numerous times			0
he even helped with tracking down @entity42 lieutenant @entity41 in @entity43 in 1967 , where the revolutionary was secretly murdered			0
that was mr @entity8 's revenge			0
the basis of his lawsuit , which won him $ 2.8billion in damages from @entity2 , was that @entity41 had ordered his father to take his own life or his sons would be killed			1
earlier this year , @entity54 @entity6 district judge @entity53 ruled that the @entity13 decisions must be honoured as attorneys for mr @entity8 and the others try to get at accounts with ties to @entity2 held by the 19 banks , including @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65			1
' the judgments granted by the @entity13 circuit court in favor of the plaintiffs and against @entity2 are entitled to full faith and credit , ' judge @entity53 wrote in an august 22 order			2
at stake is as much as $ 3.5 billion ; the families have agreed to share any proceeds they get out of the @entity77 accounts			0
@entity41 and @entity42 : mr @entity8 was granted damages of $ 2.8billion by a judge in @entity13 after claiming his father committed suicide after @entity2 revolutionaries threatened to kill his sons and wife mr @entity8 's attorney , @entity84 , who previously represented @entity87 figure @entity85 and families of sailors killed in the @entity91 terror attack , said the @entity53 ruling was a watershed moment in the case			1
the exact contents of the accounts and the account holders are sealed by court order , and the legal question now involves whether the money truly belongs to @entity2			1
' that 's the battle : is this @entity2 's money or is this someone else 's money ? ' mr @entity84 said			2
' this is the green light that opens the door for us			0
' in a nutshell , the money was halted by the @entity18 as it passed back and forth electronically through the @entity77 banks between entities in @entity2 and banks in other countries overseas			2
based on the rulings so far , @entity84 estimated more than $ 20million could be paid out by the banks within the next six months			0
another $ 20million to $ 40million , he said , could be obtained depending on upcoming legal decisions on precisely when an electronic funds transfer , or @entity120 , should be considered @entity2 property that could be seized			0
in october , the @entity6 2nd @entity121 ruled that @entity122 were subject to seizure only if @entity2 itself , or a state - owned entity , transmitted the funds directly to the bank			2
lawyers on all sides are still sorting out that decision 's impact			0
an attorney for several big banks , @entity132 , suggested that no money be turned over to @entity8 and the other families right away .			0

@entity8 was awarded billions in damages by a @entity6 judge
