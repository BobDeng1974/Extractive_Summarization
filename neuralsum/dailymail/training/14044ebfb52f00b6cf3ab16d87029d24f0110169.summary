an inquiry into the way @entity3 police sleaze in the @entity4 was branded a whitewash last night			0
the seven - month review by the @entity7 found that @entity3 should continue to sit in judgment on colleagues accused of breaking parliamentary rules			1
critics warned the plans would let mps continue to ‘ mark their own homework ’			1
in the past it has frequently been accused of taking a lenient approach , particularly against senior figures			0
under the new plans half of its members will be drawn from outside @entity29 for the first time			2
the move will result in the number of ‘ lay ’ members increasing from three to seven			1
but , controversially , these lay members will still not be given a vote on the committee ’s decisions , meaning that @entity3 will retain the final say			2
the report found there were ‘ strong constitutional reasons ’ why mps needed to remain the final arbiter on whether rules had been broken and what punishments should be enforced			1
but sir @entity46 , former chairman of the committee on standards in public life , warned the ‘ very modest ’ reforms would fail to convince the public that mps have cleaned up their act			1
‘ they have chickened out of addressing the real issue of accountability , ’ he said			1
‘ all other professions have a majority of lay members and are chaired by lay members			0
i can see no reason why the same arrangements should not apply to mps			0
but on their committee the lay members do not even have a vote , and that will not change under these proposals			0
‘ it is a very modest change indeed , and i ’m afraid it will not persuade people that mps have understood the problem and got to grips with it			2
’ @entity77 mp @entity76 , who has campaigned for sweeping reforms of the system , said the plans did not go nearly enough			2
‘ the idea that @entity3 will continue to sit in judgment on each other will be complete anathema to most people , ’ mr @entity76 said			1
‘ the public are very clear that they do not want us marking our own homework , and they are right about that			2
‘ we do not need mps adjudicating on cases that have already been investigated by the independent commissioner – all it does is fuel public suspicion that some sort of fix is going on			2
‘ these reforms will not satisfy public opinion			0
what will happen is that there will be another controversial case where this committee intervenes , and the reputation of parliament will be dragged through the mud again			0
’ @entity109 body : the report found there were ‘ strong constitutional reasons ’ why mps needed to remain the final arbiter on whether rules had been broken and what punishments should be enforced the review was launched last year following criticism of the committee ’s decision to throw out a demand from parliamentary standards commissioner @entity122 that former culture secretary @entity124 should repay £ 45,000 in expenses for over-claiming on her mortgage			1
the committee slashed the repayment demand to £ 5,800 , saying mrs @entity122 had interpreted the rules on claiming for mortgages too strictly			2
it argued that although mrs @entity124 was technically in breach she had behaved ‘ reasonably ’			1
sir @entity133 , @entity77 chairman of the @entity7 , said last year that lay members of the committee should be allowed to vote to improve public confidence			0
but yesterday he said it had proved legally difficult			0
he suggested lay members would wield greater influence by not having a vote as they would retain the right to publish their disagreements with any decision taken by the committee			0
he said : ‘ the lay members – okay , they do n’t have a vote , but they do have a voice			0
’ sir @entity133 said it would be ‘ disproportionate ’ to introduce fully independent regulation of 650 mps			1
and he insisted that his committee ‘ is not a committee that looks after mps – we do n’t let people off ’			1
former attorney - general @entity158 said parliament would have to ‘ re-write the @entity161 constitution ’ to allow outsiders to rule on the conduct of mps			1
mrs @entity122 said all new mps would be given anti-sleaze lessons after the election to help them stick to the rules			0
but she said that plans for a new code of conduct had been stalled by parliament since 2012 .			0

critics warn plans would let mps continue to ‘ mark their own homework ’
report found ‘ strong constitutional reasons ’ why mps need final say
@entity185 came after demand that @entity124 repay £ 45,000 was *overturned*
