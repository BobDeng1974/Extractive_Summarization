@entity0 may have committed war crimes when commandos stormed an aid ship in 2010 killing nine people , but officials will not be prosecuted because the offences are ' not serious enough '			1
eight @entity7 and one @entity8 died after crack troops opened fire on the crew of the @entity12 in the early hours of may 31 , 1010			1
the incident , which happened in international waters , sparked international condemnation and led to years of tense relations between @entity7 and @entity0			1
today prosecutor @entity17 said that ' there is a reasonable basis to believe that war crimes were committed on the @entity12 ' but were ' not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the @entity23 ( @entity23 )			1
' lawyers at the @entity23 have ruled that @entity0 likely committed war crimes against the crew of the @entity12 in 2010 , but that the case does not warrant prosecution nine @entity7 died when @entity0 troops storming the boat opened fire - the crew claim the soldiers fired without warning , while @entity0 says they shot after being attacked ( pictured , activists hold a @entity0 troop ) he added : ' without in any way minimizing the impact of the alleged crimes on the victims and their families ... the @entity23 shall prioritise war crimes committed on a large scale			1
' @entity0 's @entity45 welcomed the decision to close the probe , saying the case was ' legally unfounded and politically motivated			0
' a spokesman for the ministry sought to point out that the court had also chosen not to act over violence against its soldiers by activists on board the @entity12			0
the boat , the flagship of a six - craft flotilla aimed at breaking the blockade of @entity60 and carrying 10,000 tons of aid to shore , was caught in a stand - off with @entity0 after being stopped at sea			2
in the early hours of may 31 the ship was stormed by commandos who dropped on to the deck from a helicopter and used ropes to climb up the sides			0
activists on board the ship claim the soldiers opened fire before boarding or issuing any warning , while @entity0 maintains the soldiers only fired after troops were beaten with sticks and metal poles			1
the case was taken to the @entity23 last year after the tiny @entity83 state of @entity84 - which is a member of the court - filed a complaint , as the ship was flying under a @entity84 flag			1
neither @entity7 nor @entity0 are not part of the @entity23 , which only has jurisdiction over member states			1
a @entity7 lawyer representing @entity84 has vowed not to give up the case			0
the @entity93 was the flagship of a six - boat flotilla that was trying to bring 10,000 tons of aid to @entity96 when it was stopped in international waters			0
after a standoff with @entity0 forces , troops stormed the boat @entity7 lawyers have vowed not to give up the case , saying that the @entity23 prosecuted rebels who killed a similar number of @entity83 peacekeepers in @entity109 ( pictured , a wounded @entity0 commando is taken away by rebels ) @entity111 said : ' this is a moral struggle that we 're pursuing by ourselves			1
it 's a legal struggle , a struggle in the name of humanity			0
this struggle is n't over			0
' we will object to a higher court at the @entity23 and we believe without a doubt that we will prevail			0
' in a 61 - page report , prosecutors concluded that ' there is a reasonable basis to believe ' @entity0 wilfully killed , wilfully caused serious injury and deprived passengers of dignity			2
the report said that the findings were based on ' information available at this stage ' , adding that none of the information was collected by the @entity23			0
a @entity136 report in july 2011 found that the raid was justified , but that @entity0 used excessive force			2
@entity7 lawyers seeking an @entity23 case turned to @entity84 because the tiny nation is a member of the court and the @entity12 was registered under the country 's flag			1
they pointed to another @entity23 case , in @entity146 , in which the court prosecuted rebels accused of leading an attack on @entity151 peacekeepers in @entity109 in which 11 people died			2
@entity153 said the @entity23 was setting a double standard by recognising the gravity of 11 troops being killed , but ignoring the nine protesters			2
in their report , prosecutors addressed the similarities in the number of victims in the two cases , but added there was also a key difference , as @entity109 rebels ' attack was deliberate .			0

@entity23 rules there is basis to say war crimes took place
but lawyers will not prosecute as the offences are ' not sufficiently grave '
eight @entity7 and one @entity178 - @entity177 died in raid on ship by @entity0 troops
crew say soldiers fired first but @entity0 says troops fired after being attacked
