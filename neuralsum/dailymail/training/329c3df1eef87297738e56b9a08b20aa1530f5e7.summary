rebel conservative backbenchers are plotting to line up with mps from @entity16 and other parties to block plans for a dramatic expansion of the @entity21 ’s reserve forces			1
the move , led by @entity24 mp @entity23 , could potentially threaten a @entity26 scheme to remove 20,000 full - time personnel and beef up what used to be called the @entity13			1
but there are already fears that the plan is running into trouble , with new figures showing that the newly - named ‘ @entity13 ’ is shrinking rather than growing to a planned size of 30,000 within five years			0
led by mr @entity23 , the 17 - strong group of rebel @entity35 will this week try to force the @entity2 to order a study into the ‘ viability and cost - effectiveness ’ of the scheme			1
the rebels , who also include former shadow home secretary @entity40 , will seek the backing of @entity15 and those from smaller parties in an attempt to inflict a humiliating @entity46 defeat on mr @entity2			1
mr @entity23 said last night : ‘ there is growing concern in @entity49 about the rising costs and badly missed recruitment targets of the government ’s @entity13 plans			2
mps of all parties want to scrutinise their viability and cost - effectiveness			2
’ another rebel @entity24 said : ‘ we ca n’t use a @entity46 vote to tell the @entity59 what size the @entity13 should be but we can raise questions about the replacement reservist plan – questions that they have to answer			2
’ last night , the @entity59 responded by insisting that the service reforms were on track			0
a spokesman said : ‘ the reforms to the @entity13 were announced over a year ago and are well under way			0
‘ we are two months into a five - year recruitment campaign that will see the @entity13 increasing from 19,000 to 30,000 by 2018 with improved training and equipment			0
‘ over 25,000 reservists have served on the front line in @entity75 and @entity76			0
we intend to make increased use of them in future , in line with the way most of our allies operate			0
’ rebel conservative backbenchers are plotting to line up with mps from @entity16 and other parties to block plans for a dramatic expansion of the @entity21 's reserve forces @entity16 has so far declined to say how it will vote but sources close to shadow defence secretary @entity89 said they were ‘ strongly inclined ’ to back the @entity24 rebels			1
mr @entity2 ’s allies hit back last night , warning @entity16 against ‘ playing politics ’ with the future of the @entity13			1
one said : ‘ it would be a shame if @entity16 did this as they have previously agreed to the need to reshape the @entity13 with an increase in the reserves and a reduction in the regulars			0
after years of neglect under @entity16 , the reserves are being rebuilt , fully funded and equipped properly			0
