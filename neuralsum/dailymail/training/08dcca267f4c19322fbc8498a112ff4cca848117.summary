@entity0 last night warned @entity1 his billionaire ‘ cronies ’ will have their assets frozen in @entity5 unless he co-operates with the probe into @entity7			1
the prime minister vented his fury at @entity12 ’s obstruction in a 30 - minute phone call – the first direct contact between the leaders since the jet was shot down with the loss of 298 lives			1
he effectively blamed @entity12 , telling mr @entity1 he had ‘ contributed to an appalling tragedy ’			1
foreign secretary @entity32 said : ' the @entity12 have influence , if not direct control , over these people			1
' they have been supplying , they have been supporting them , they can not deny their responsibility for the acts these people are carrying out			0
' ' there a growing number of strands of evidence , which looked at together in the round , lead the reasonable person to the unavoidable truth that this was a missile fired from rebel - held territory , almost certainly a missile supplied by the @entity12			2
' the prime minister has said the conflict ' could have been stopped by @entity68 '			1
he said all the evidence pointed to the fact that ' @entity24 was blown out of the sky by a surface - to - air missile fired from a rebel - held area '			0
mr @entity0 said : ' if this is the case then we must be clear what it means : this is a direct result of @entity12 destabilising a sovereign state , violating its territorial integrity , backing thuggish militias and training and arming them			2
' and he urged him to ‘ change course ’ by calling off the armed thugs in eastern @entity43 thought to have been behind the atrocity that left ten @entity88 dead			2
@entity88 is now pushing for @entity90 sanctions against mr @entity1 ’s ‘ crony group ’ of wealthy supporters , some of whom use @entity5 as their playground			1
@entity96 refused to comment on exactly which individuals would be targeted , but there is speculation it could eventually include well - known figures such as @entity102 , who has close links to the @entity1 regime			2
@entity105 played down suggestions mr @entity1 , who is thought to have spirited away billions , could be personally targeted at this stage			0
sanctions could also include an @entity90 - wide ban on arms sales to @entity12 and curbs on the ability of @entity12 energy firms to raise money in @entity115			1
mr @entity0 , who will make a statement to the @entity117 on the crisis today , told mr @entity1 that @entity12 ’s stance so far was ‘ completely unacceptable ’			1
he urged him to intervene immediately to ensure the victims , whose bodies have been removed by local militias , could have proper funerals			0
a source said he told the @entity12 president : ‘ ten of my citizens have just been killed in a plane brought down by a missile fired by @entity12 separatists			0
' i have been asking to speak to you since this happened			0
you clearly can play a role in exerting influence on the separatists to grant us access to the site			0
’ earlier , mr @entity0 said the @entity141 must ‘ fundamentally change our approach to @entity12 ’ in the wake of the crisis			1
@entity88 and @entity144 will today try to push through a @entity146 resolution calling for investigators to be granted immediate access			0
but @entity88 sources are gloomy about its prospects after @entity68 vetoed a similar call on saturday			0
foreign secretary @entity32 will travel to @entity153 tomorrow to hammer out the details of new sanctions on @entity12			1
armed separatists in the area around @entity158 in eastern @entity43 have refused investigators access to the site recovery : @entity43 @entity163 employees continue to search for bodies amongst the wreckage at the crash site of @entity167 , near the village of @entity169 , 100km east of @entity158 mr @entity0 yesterday held talks with @entity36 chancellor @entity35 and @entity38 president @entity37 , both of whom were resisting tough sanctions on @entity12 less than 24 hours before the @entity175 jet was shot down on thursday			1
a @entity105 spokesman said the two leaders agreed with mr @entity0 that ‘ the @entity90 must reconsider its approach to @entity12 and that foreign ministers should be ready to impose further sanctions ’			1
however , @entity105 cautioned that the crisis was running faster than the @entity153 machinery can cope with – meaning that it may take some weeks before the new sanctions regime is fully in place			2
sources stressed mr @entity1 has the chance to limit the damage to @entity12 ’s struggling economy by co-operating fully now			2
a small number of senior @entity12 officials have been subjected to asset freezes and travel bans following @entity12 ’s annexation of the @entity195 earlier this year			0
mr @entity32 yesterday said these would now be widened to ‘ include the so - called crony group around president @entity1 ’			1
mr @entity0 has led calls for tougher sanctions on @entity12 but has faced resistance from @entity36 's @entity35			1
the @entity202 ' @entity201 ( right ) is likely to back sanctions following last week 's attack @entity96 said it would press for action against ‘ individuals who have influence on the @entity12 leadership and who have influence in terms of financial flows ’			2
mr @entity32 acknowledged that the level of sanctions being considered could hurt @entity5 , where wealthy @entity12 have invested an estimated £ 27billion , and said other countries must ‘ share the pain ’			1
he said : ‘ we have levers which we can apply to @entity12 ; we can inflict damage on the @entity12 economy			0
’ in a strongly - worded article in the @entity222 , mr @entity0 said the @entity141 could not allow @entity12 ’s actions in @entity43 to stand			1
‘ this is not about military action , plainly , ’ he said			0
‘ but it is time to make our power , influence and resources count			0
our economies are strong , and growing in strength			0
and yet we sometimes behave as if we need @entity12 more than @entity12 needs us			0
’ following @entity68 ’s annexation of @entity195 , @entity234 , a leading critic of mr @entity1 , said sanctions should target figures such as mr @entity102 and businessman @entity238 , who owns a major stake in @entity240			0
mr @entity102 made no comment at the time but is understood to consider himself a private citizen who should not face sanctions			0
he is a close ally of mr @entity1 and is said to enjoy ‘ privileged access ’ to the @entity12 president , but has always denied playing any political role .			2
