by @entity0 some people may think that the spread of herpes is a modern problem			0
but scientists have found that @entity6 - 1 , which manifests itself as cold sores , infected hominids before the evolutionary split from chimpanzees , six million years ago			1
while genital herpes , or @entity6 , jumped from ancient chimpanzees to ancestors of modern humans - @entity15 erectus - approximately 1.6 million years ago , they claim			1
scientists studied the cross-species transmission , from chimps ( stock image pictured ) to human ancestors using advanced models of molecular evolution			1
they found the @entity23 , which manifests itself as cold sores , infected hominids before the evolutionary split from chimpanzees six million years ago scientists have found that @entity6 - 1 , which manifests itself as cold sores , infected hominids before the evolutionary split from chimpanzees six million years ago			1
genital herpes , or @entity6 , jumped from ancient chimpanzees to ancestors of modern humans - @entity31 - approximately 1.6 million years ago			1
the researchers compared the @entity23 and @entity6 gene sequences to the family tree of simplex viruses from eight monkey and ape host species			0
using advanced models of molecular evolution , they were able to estimate ancient viral divergence times more accurately than before			1
this allowed the experts to determine when @entity23 and @entity6 were introduced into humans with far more precision than previous models , which do not account for natural selection over the course of viral evolution			2
this jump occurred long before the rise of early modern humans about 200,000 years ago			1
this jump occurred long before the rise of early modern humans about 200,000 years ago			1
’ before we were human , there was still cross-species transmission into our evolutionary lineage , ’ said @entity56 , assistant research scientist at the @entity57			2
modern versions viruses are spread by intimate contact and @entity6 - 1 can also be spread by sharing drinks			1
‘ the results help us to better understand how these viruses evolved and found their way into humans , ’ dr @entity56 explained			2
‘ animal disease reservoirs are extremely important for global public health			0
' understanding where our viruses come from will help guide us in preventing future viruses from making the jump into humans			0
’ it is thought that two thirds of the human population is infected with at least one form of the virus , which shows itself as cold sores on the mouth or blisters on the genitals			2
dr @entity56 said : ‘ humans are the only primates we know of that have two herpes simplex viruses			0
we wanted to determine why			0
’ genital herpes or @entity6 ( pictured ) jumped from ancient chimpanzees to ancestors of modern humans - @entity31 - approximately 1.6 million years ago , experts claim @entity6 1 and 2 ( @entity6 - 1 and @entity6 ) both infect humans			1
@entity23 produces cold sores , while @entity6 produces genital herpes			1
both are contagious and can be shared from direct contact as well as contact with saliva			0
symptoms of the viruses include watery blisters on the skin , which can be painful			0
@entity6 - 1 and @entity6 persist in the body by becoming latent and hiding from the immune system			2
after initial infection , some people experience sporadic outbreaks			0
the researchers compared the @entity23 and @entity6 gene sequences to the family tree of simplex viruses from eight monkey and ape host species			0
using advanced models of molecular evolution , they were able to estimate ancient viral divergence times more accurately than before			1
this allowed the experts to determine when @entity23 and @entity6 were introduced into humans with far more precision than previous models , which do not account for natural selection over the course of viral evolution			2
the genetics of human and primate herpes viruses were examined to assess their similarity			0
scientists found that @entity23 has been present in humans far longer than @entity6 , prompting the researchers to further investigate the origins of @entity6 in humans			0
the viral family tree showed that @entity6 was far more genetically similar to the herpes virus found in chimpanzees			0
this level of divergence indicates that humans must have acquired @entity6 from an ancestor of modern chimpanzees about 1.6 million years ago , prior to the rise of modern humans roughly 200,000 years ago			1
‘ comparing virus gene sequences gives us insight into viral pathogens that have been infecting us since before we were humans , ’ dr @entity56 said			0
it is thought that two thirds of the human population is infected with at least one form of the virus , which shows itself as cold sores on the mouth ( pictured ) or blisters on the genitals			2

genital herpes or @entity6 jumped from ancient chimpanzees to ancestors of modern humans - @entity31 - approximately 1.6 million years ago
@entity6 - 1 , which manifests itself as cold sores , infected hominids before the evolutionary split from chimpanzees six million years ago
@entity57 scientists studied the cross-species transmission using advanced models of molecular evolution
understanding how viruses evolved could help experts prevent them
