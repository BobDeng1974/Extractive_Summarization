@entity0 is on the brink of being sacked as manager of @entity3			1
the @entity4 is due to have a meeting with @entity7 chairman @entity6 on thursday following the abject 4 - 0 defeat at @entity9			1
@entity6 has been loyal to @entity0 - who has had to cut costs and work within tighter budgetary constraints - and believed there were signs the manager was heading in the right direction			1
however , results and recent performances have put pressure on to make a change before @entity3 get cut adrift by the teams above them			2
@entity0 ( centre ) is at a loss as @entity3 are hammered 4 - 0 by @entity9 at @entity24 the @entity26 table the main issue seems to be whether they can pay @entity0 off - and then who would replace him			1
academy director @entity30 , who was briefly joint - caretaker boss with @entity31 before @entity0 's appointment , is the strong bookies ' favourite , with @entity35 and @entity36 also in the mix. @entity3 have won just once in the championship this season and are second from bottom with only @entity41 - who only had eight players the day before the season started - below them			2
the players do not seem to be playing for @entity0 and the manager , who talked in an interview last week about trying to find a settled side , chops and changes frequently - there were five against @entity9			1
this has led to some horrendous performances , home and away			0
the fans have lost patience with him , too , as the vocal minority have become the majority			2
there were pitch invasions against @entity62 on saturday and chants for the manager to go at @entity24			0
@entity0 and his no 2 @entity65 leave the pitch after a chastening night for the @entity3 manager @entity0 's apparent inability to acknowledge that his actions play a part in the current struggle has infuriated supporters but even after a display as rancid as the one at @entity9 , he still insisted he was the right man for the job and that there was a ' good spirit ' among the players			1
he told the @entity79 : ' i ’m here to work , i ’m here to do my very best and that ’s what i ’m doing right now			0
' i do n’t think that way at all ( about being sacked )			0
i ’m working very hard to turn this round			0
' i do n’t think the players have chucked the towel in , i think they have shown a very good spirit			0
they have shown a good spirit and kept on going			0

@entity0 set for meeting with @entity3 chairman @entity6
@entity3 are 23rd in @entity26 following 4 - 0 defeat by @entity9
club fear they will drop into @entity96 under @entity0
manager has lost the @entity3 fans , who called for his head at @entity9
