@entity0 and @entity1 made bets on fingerprint scanning for their flagship phones but @entity5 is taking a different route			1
the @entity8 firm has developed an iris authentication system that unlocks a smartphone screen by scanning your eyes			1
and its prototype can be used to log into @entity14 , email or other web services			1
the prototype ( pictured ) can be used to log into @entity14 , email or other web services the demo of the prototype is on display at @entity28 in @entity29			1
‘ @entity5 ’s new authentication method uses iris recognition , which is hard to forge and convenient to use , ’ the firm told @entity31			1
‘ the screen can be unlocked simply by looking at it , which eliminates the trouble of having to use [ your ] hands when wearing gloves and ca n’t use a fingerprint			0
’ the end of the password ? for its prototype ( demo pictured ) , @entity5 has built a miniature scanner so it fits on the front of a @entity48 recognises the pattern by shining an infrared led light on the sensor onto the eyes and taking a picture of the patten with the infrared camera @entity5 has developed a ‘ custom compact and high - output infrared led ’ , and a custom infrared camera			1
movements of the smooth muscle of the iris make the eye ’s openings larger or smaller , which in turn adjusts the amount of light that enters the retina these were combined with @entity5 ’s camera controller technology and biometric - authentication technology			1
it identifies a person by scanning the pattern of their iris			2
the pattern does n’t change significantly after the age of two , and it is difficult to injure its surface and difficult to forge			0

for its prototype , @entity5 has built a miniature scanner so it fits on the front of a smartphone			2
it recognises the pattern by shining an infrared led light on the sensor into the eyes and taking a picture of the pattern with the infrared camera			1
this pattern is registered and linked to the user			0
each time they look at their phone , the sensor scans their eye , matches it with the stored image and unlocks the device			1
‘ the system can reliably authenticate the detailed patterns of the iris and that can be used in most everyday situations , ’ a spokesman for @entity5 told @entity105 ‘ this can be used at a normal smartphone viewing distance , rather than within the 10cm range most existing iris recognition systems require			1
‘ and in safety testing , the infrared led light was verified to be safe for the eyes			2
’ the pattern on a person 's iris does n’t change significantly after the age of two , and it is difficult to injure its surface and difficult to forge			0
here a diagram shows how infra red scanning is used to identify a person @entity127 authentication is a type of biometric authentication , similar to fingerprint scanners			0
it identifies a person by scanning the pattern of their iris , which is the ring around the pupil of the eye			2
chip maker @entity138 has unveiled its @entity140 fingerprint scanner - the first biometric sensor using ultrasonic technology			0
it uses ultrasonic sound waves to capture the ridges , sweat pores and more on the tip of a finger in greater detail than capacitive touch id sensors seen on the likes of @entity0 and @entity1 devices			0
this not only makes it more accurate than other sensors , but it will also work even if the user ’s hands are wet or have dirt or lotions on it , for example			0
phones running @entity162 are expected to launch later this year , but @entity138 did not reveal to @entity31 which devices or manufacturers it is working with			0

movements of the smooth muscle of the iris make the eye ’s openings larger or smaller , which in turn adjusts the amount of light that enters the retina			0
for its prototype , @entity5 has built a miniature scanner it fits on the front of a smartphone			2
previous versions of similar technology have been larger or not powerful enough for phones and tablets			0
@entity5 ’s technology recognises the pattern by shining an infrared led light on the sensor onto the eyes and taking a picture of the patten with the infrared camera			1
this pattern is registered and linked to the user and each time they look at their phone , the sensor scans their eye , matches it with the stored image and unlocks the device			1
@entity5 told @entity31 the sensor will work from ‘ a standard smartphone viewing distance ’ , which is said to be up to 9 inches ( 22cm )			2
traditional iris authentication systems work up to 3inches ( 10cm ) , for example .			2

@entity5 has developed an iris authentication system
it unlocks a smartphone screen by scanning your eyes
and it can be used to log into @entity14 , email or other sites
technology recognises iris pattern by shining infrared light onto the eyes
it takes an image of the iris pattern with the infrared camera which is then *cross-referenced* each time the user looks at their phone
