@entity1 coach @entity0 has no intention of saving @entity3 for a @entity5 assault on @entity6 and will recall the paceman as soon as possible			1
@entity3 was the runaway man - of - the - series in last winter 's ashes and there are serious concerns about how @entity6 will react should he find his very best form again in the tournament opener in @entity15 on february 14			1
he has been missing for the last few weeks with fitness niggles and undisclosed personal reasons , and there have been suggestions @entity0 might hold his strike bowler back until that match , denying @entity6 closer look should they reach the final of the ongoing tri-series			1
@entity3 will not be rested ahead of the @entity5 and could play for @entity1 at the tri-nations @entity3 celebrates after taking the wicket of @entity26 during the last winter @entity10 @entity1 players celebrate their victory over @entity6 at the @entity29 in @entity30 but @entity0 intends to reintegrate the left - armer at the first opportunity , potentially as soon as monday 's match against @entity34			1
' he 'd be close			0
he 's bowling ( in the nets ) and will be full training on sunday , so hopefully he 's available for selection , ' said @entity0			0
' there 's no resting			0
it 's a final so there 's a trophy up for grabs and we 've got to try and win that so that 's important for us as well			0
' for us it 's a case of worrying what we do well and keep doing that			0
we ca n't worry about @entity6 , we can only worry about what we 're doing			2
' captain @entity50 was on fine form as @entity1 prepare for the forthcoming @entity5 @entity6 's @entity52 can only watch as he is run out during defeat by @entity1 the @entity1 line - up that beat @entity6 in @entity30 on friday was also missing captain @entity55 ( banned ) , @entity56 and @entity57 ( both hamstring )			1
@entity55 will return having served his over-rate suspension , @entity56 is inked back in at the top of the order but @entity57 may take longer			2
' @entity56 will be fine , he 'll come back in , with @entity57 we 'll just see how he goes at training , ' added @entity0			0
' we want to get everyone 100 per cent fit for the final and then the @entity5 so that 's what we 're looking at			2
