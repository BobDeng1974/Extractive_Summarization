two radio djs in @entity1 who caused an uproar last week by posting the homophobic rsvp to a birthday party for a ' little girl with two gay dads ' admitted on saturday that the whole thing was a hoax			1
@entity10 @entity9 and @entity11 on wednesday posted on their show 's facebook page a heartbreaking note written on an invitation to a ' tie dye party ' for a girl named ' @entity19 's ' seventh birthday			1
the @entity10 tricked people into believing that @entity19 had two gay dads , and the note - supposedly written by the mother of a friend of @entity19 's , who they called ' @entity22 ' - stated ' @entity22 will not attend			1
i do not believe in what you do and will not subject my innocent son to your lifestyle			2
i 'm sorry @entity19 has to grow up this way			0
' frauds : djs @entity11 and @entity9 admitted their story about a homophobic response to a birthday invitation was a hoax people were outraged by the woman 's apparent bigotry , and the two fraudsters even left a phone number for the woman - who they called ' @entity46 ' - and encouraged people to give her a ring if they ' have an issue			1
' on saturday , the @entity10 - apparently at the behest of @entity50 - admitted that the entire story was a lie and issued an apology			1
' @entity56 , ' the statement begins , ' on wednesday , we told you the story of @entity19 's birthday party , and one parent 's objection to the same - sex household of @entity19 's parents			1
we also posted the invitation on our @entity67 page , and invited comments from our followers			2
' this story was , in fact , totally fictitious , and created by the two of us			0
this was done without the knowledge of @entity75 - 98.3 management or ownership			1
' we were attempting to spur a healthy discourse on a highly passionate topic , but we made a mistake by misleading our listeners into thinking that this specific situation actually existed			0
' we are very sorry that we perpetuated this falsehood , even after it was clear that it had taken on a ' life of its own			0
' we deeply apologize for violating your trust , and we will work hard to regain that trust			0
' neither @entity9 or @entity11 responded to @entity92 's request for further comment			2
bogus : radio djs @entity9 and @entity11 admitted they were responsible for this bogus rsvp that caused so much outrage last week people already have taken to social media to express their outrage and ' disgust ' over the @entity10 ' exploiting such a sensitive issue for a cheap gag			1
' i think this type of behavior is completely unacceptable , ' @entity103 wrote in the comment section of the pair 's apology			0
' there is enough of this type of hate going on without these two idiots creating a very public farce about it			0
i frankly think they should be terminated and sanctioned			0
. ' an anonymous poster wrote ' what were they thinking ( if indeed they were thinking ! ) ? that was a stupid , vicious and totally unacceptable behavior			0
they should be fired asap			0
' the initial - ultimately bogus - story that the mother of a 7 - year - old would be so vicious on an rsvp to a little girl 's birthday party gained a lot of traction in the blogosphere and outraged people across the world			1
' so she is probably afraid the 2 gay men will influence her son and that he could ' become ' gay ? well , i hope her son turns out to be gay			2
. so she can see that there is nothing you can do against it and it 's not a choice , ' a commenter from the @entity139 wrote in the comment section of the @entity92 article about the supposed homophobic rsvp			0
it 's unclear what - if any - further discipline the @entity10 will receive - station management did not respond to @entity92 's request for comment			2
liars : @entity9 and @entity11 were forced to admit their story was a lie - but not before it already had been published on websites around the world			1

k - 98.3 djs @entity9 and @entity11 posted a photo of an invitation to the birthday party of a ' 7 - year - old girl with two gay dads '
on the invitation there was a note from a mother saying she did *n't* approve of their lifestyle so her son would not be attending the party
on saturday , the @entity10 admitted the entire thing was a lie
