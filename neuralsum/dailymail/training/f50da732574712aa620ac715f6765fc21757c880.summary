by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 11 may 2013 updated : 16:00 est , 11 may 2013 my battle : @entity3 suffers from deafness the @entity3 are no strangers to tragedy and trauma			1
between them they have endured difficult childhoods , infidelity , domestic violence and divorce			2
and now they are facing their biggest ordeal of all as @entity15 bravely confronts the final stages of breast cancer			1
it ’s a situation that has focused the minds of all the girls – and left one of them , @entity21 , determined to tackle a health problem that has been blighting her life : deafness ‘ seeing @entity15 so poorly has made me more aware than ever that we should do what we can to look after ourselves and make sure we live life to the full , ’ she explains			2
‘ i feel so blessed that hearing is my only health problem , which is entirely in my control to fix and can be easily resolved			1
’ @entity21 , 58 , says her problems date back to the early days of the sisters ’ singing career			1
‘ i have just 50 per cent hearing in my right ear , ’ she reveals			1
‘ i remember doing a 1960s rock ’ n ’ roll tour and being deaf every night when i came off stage , with a hissing in my ear			1
‘ i have been subjected to such massive noise through work – you ’ve no idea how loud it could be on stage , even performing in the working men ’s clubs when we were kids			0
’ today @entity21 is speaking about her problem for the first time , to launch @entity55 ’ @entity52 , which celebrate achievement by people with hearing loss			1
you would n’t know it to look at her , but @entity21 has two new hearing aids that she says have transformed her life			1
with her beauty , youthful looks and glamorous make - up and hair , @entity21 certainly crushes the stereotype of a hearing - aid wearer as elderly and debilitated			1
‘ i know there ’s a stigma about wearing hearing aids but i do n’t understand why , ’ she says			1
‘ i do n’t mind mine at all – with these new models , you ca n’t see them at all anyway			0
’ to demonstrate , she pops out the two tiny devices that sit in her ear canal – the size , shape and colour of a baked bean – and puts them on the table			1
behind the jollity , the troubles to have hit the family are never far from her mind			0
@entity15 , 53 , has advanced , incurable breast cancer and is the third of the singing sisters to be diagnosed with the disease			1
‘ she ’s got cancer of everything now , really , ’ says @entity21 , who is staying with @entity15 the week we meet			1
‘ what ’s worse – and what will get her – is that she has lung cancer and now lung disease			1
she is on oxygen and it ’s very traumatic			0
’ back in the day : the @entity3 on the @entity100 show in 1977 - from left , @entity15 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity21 and @entity104 it is a very different picture back at @entity21 ’s home in @entity107 , where she lives with husband @entity108 , 48 , a music tour manager			1
their son @entity109 , 24 , has just moved back in with his fiancee @entity110 , 23 , and daughter @entity111 , two			0
‘ it ’s a mad house			0
@entity109 was floundering a bit with bills so i said he was welcome to come and live with us			0
‘ my husband is still a bit traumatised , with the baby jumping on him every morning – but i grew up in a mad household so i love it			0
i did n’t ever want him to leave , ’ says @entity21			0
it was her family who first noticed her hearing problems			1
‘ they ’re never shy of telling it like it is , ’ says @entity21			0
‘ they used to say , “ @entity130 you ’re deaf			0
” but i ’d say , “ no , no , you ’re not speaking clearly			0
” i was always turning up the tv and my son would come in and say , “ mum that ’s deafening ! ” ‘ i found it hard to interact with people sometimes , but i never thought my hearing was making life difficult			1
’ two years ago , @entity21 finally accepted something was wrong as she lay in bed talking to @entity108 – and noticed she was lifting her head off the pillow whenever he spoke			0
tragedy : @entity143 was diagnosed with cancer in 2010 and was recently told it is terminal ‘ i was raising myself up to stop my left ear being muffled as that was the only way i could hear him , ’ she says			1
‘ i thought , “ i should be able to hear with just one ear , ” but i could n’t			2
i knew then that i had a problem			0
’ but like most people who fear they are losing their hearing , @entity21 did nothing about it			2
she says : ‘ when you ’re not completely deaf and managing to enjoy life , it ’s easy to ignore it			0
but as time went on it got much worse – often i ’d know someone was talking to me but be unable to work out what they were saying			0
my sense of humour went out of the door as i kept missing jokes			0
’ in march this year , she finally went for a hearing test			2
‘ it was a shock to find i had just 50 per cent hearing in my right ear			1
the other ear has a slight degeneration , too			2
’ while many people might be upset by the prospect of hearing aids , @entity21 was happy			1
‘ i was relieved as i was n’t living life to the full , ’ she says			0
‘ getting older is a very gradual thing so whatever it brings does n’t really upset me			0
‘ i ’m still pretty healthy , i look ok and i ’ll cope with it			0
older people think losing their hearing is a reflection on them ageing			2
but it ’s much more ageing to not be able to keep up with what ’s going on around you			0
i was left out of conversations as i could n’t hear – and that ages you more than anything			0
’ @entity21 ’s hearing loss could be partly genetic – her 86 - year - old aunt is profoundly deaf and her mother has otosclerosis , a hereditary condition in which bone grows across the ear			1
@entity21 has yet to find out if she is affected , though it can be corrected through surgery			0
however , she admits that using the hearing aids has taken some adjustment			1
‘ i could immediately hear more clearly what people were saying			0
but i found it weird hearing my own voice in my head – it ’s like sticking your fingers in your ears so your voice is amplified			2
’ @entity21 is currently touring with the hit musical @entity213			0
she says : ‘ i ’ve tried out the hearing aids during a sound check , but not for the show itself as that would take getting used to and the stage is the one place i ’ve never had a problem			1
’ she is now determined to fix the hearing of the rest of her famous clan – whose best - known hit was @entity226 in 1979			2
‘ when i told my sisters about my hearing loss they just laughed , ’ she says			1
‘ my brother @entity230 already has a hearing aid – he ’s the eldest of us at 64 – and i ’m encouraging all my sisters to get tested			2
‘ it ’s funny but i really notice hearing problems in other people now – they cock their head to one side and ask you to repeat things , or have a vacant look as they have n’t heard properly			1
’ for @entity21 , that is a reminder of how much hearing aids have helped			1
‘ i wish i ’d done it years ago , ’ she says			0
‘ the worst thing about hearing loss is the isolation			2
with aids , you become part of society again			2
and i now have the tv at a normal sound level – which is a relief to everybody in the house ! ’ @entity257 is supporting @entity55 ’ @entity52			0
to nominate someone , visit a @entity55 store or go to @entity261 / hearing			2
@entity55 now offers free @entity263 hearing care .			2

@entity3 began suffering from hearing problems since the 60s
currently has 50 per cent hearing on her ear and needs aids
sister @entity143 was told last month her cancer is terminal
