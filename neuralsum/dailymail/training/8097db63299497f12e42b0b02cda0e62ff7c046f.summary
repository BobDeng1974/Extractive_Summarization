by @entity1 reporter published : 13:54 est , 3 june 2013 updated : 01:46 est , 4 june 2013 ' no confidence ' : 13 of @entity4 's 14 deputy fire chiefs co-signed a letter blasting their boss @entity6 saying that he showed no leadership at the @entity9 bombing the embattled @entity4 fire chief @entity10 resigned on monday after clashes with senior staff over his management style and his perceived weak handling of the @entity9 bombings			1
@entity6 was the first chief in @entity17 's history hired from outside of its powerful union and since the april 15th terror attack he came under pressure from his 13 deputy chief , all who have risen up through the city ranks			1
he will leave his post on june 7th and deputy chief @entity26 will step in to take temporary charge according to @entity28 , a spokesman for the @entity4 fire department			2
in may , the @entity30 obtained a leaked letter that 13 of the city 's 14 deputy fire chiefs co-signed on april 26th signalling a vote of no - confidence in chief @entity6			1
' his justification for failing to take action is indefensible , ' they wrote			0
that was just 11 days after the bombings at the finish line of the marathon killed three people and injured more than 250 others			1
in his resignation letter , @entity6 said that he was leaving his job because of the ' baseless attacks by the @entity48 , especially their actions of making this a matter of public debate by leaking their letter of april 26th to the press , has made it impossible for me to continue to do my job			1
' mr @entity6 initially defended himself in may , saying that is a ' nationally accepted practice ' for the top chief to continue to allow his deputies to handle the situation if everything seems to be working , rather than insert themselves into a situation that is already being controlled			1
swearing in : @entity10 is sworn in as the @entity17 's @entity66 in november 2011 chaos : police and some fire officials were already at the bomb site when the two pressure cooker bombs went off but more were immediately dispatched ' when i got there i was comfortable with what was going on , ' he told @entity76			1
' you only take command ( as chief ) if there ’s something going wrong or if you can strengthen the command position or if it ’s overwhelming for the incident commander , and none of those things were in fact happening			0
' however , in his resignation letter dated june 3rd , @entity6 said that he never had the support of his deputies and was left with no choice but to resign			1
' your selection of me as chief never had the support of a number of members of the @entity17 who preferred that the chief be selected from within the ranks of the @entity17 itself , ' @entity6 said in the letter			1
' i think it is also fair to say that unfortunately a vocal and aggressive minority of the members of the @entity17 did not support our efforts			1
' under control : overall , the emergency response to the bombings has been widely praised as three people died on the scene but all of the more than 250 others who were able to get to a hospital were saved the deputies - with the exception of one who did not sign the no - confidence letter - said in their april letter that this is not the first time they have been disappointed by mr @entity6 's actions			1
they even mention an instance where there was a six - alarm fire in a @entity4 building and after he allegedly cleared the scene of being under control by the deputies , mr @entity6 went to the roof of the building next door to take a picture of himself with the flames in the background for his scrapbook			2
mr @entity6 vehemently denied the story to @entity76 , saying that it never happened			0
one thing he does n't deny is that he changed the department 's protocol when he came into office in november 2011 , making it so that he would not automatically become the so - called ' incident commander ' at a fire as soon as he arrived			2
he justified the move saying that before changing the operating procedure , he polled 29 other city fire departments around the country and the only one that still made the fire chief the incident commander was in @entity151 , @entity152			0
his deputies do n't see the move as one out of public safety but more out of self - preservation			0
protocols : @entity6 changed the procedure for the department when he took office so that he is not automatically made the incident commander when he arrives at the scene of a fire ' ( mr @entity6 ) shields himself from immediate accountability while setting the stage for under ­ mining the confidence and authority of his command staff			0
while acknowledging his ultimate accountability for depart ­ ment operations , he avoids on - the - scene responsibility , ' they wrote in the letter			2
@entity4 mayor @entity177 's office confirmed it had received the resignation letter but said it had no immediate comment			0
@entity177 , who is in the final year of a two - decade run as mayor , had previously said he would stand by @entity10			2
the criticism of @entity182 stands in contrast to praise offered to @entity4 police commissioner @entity185 , who became one of the best - known faces of @entity4 's response			0
the department ’s current chief of operations , @entity26 , has been named acting chief , @entity28 said			0
@entity26 was one of the 13 deputy chiefs who signed the april letter			1
a woman who answered the phone monday at the @entity4 firefighters local 718 said union officials were n’t commenting on @entity6 ’s resignation			0
@entity177 ’s office referred comment to @entity28			0
@entity6 , the city ’s first @entity203 chief , was also the first hired from outside the department ’s own union			0
he led the @entity208 department and was an assistant chief in @entity210 before coming to @entity4 in 2011			0
in his resignation letter , @entity6 said his outsider status hindered his efforts to fulfill his mission to modernize the department			0
‘ a number of members ... preferred that the chief be selected from within the ranks of the @entity17 itself , ’ he wrote			1
‘ i think it is also fair to say that unfortunately a vocal and aggressive minority of the members of the @entity17 did not support our efforts , ’ he said .			2
