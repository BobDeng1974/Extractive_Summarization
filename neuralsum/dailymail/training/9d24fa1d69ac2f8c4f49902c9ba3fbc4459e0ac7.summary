@entity0 felt the full force of @entity3 bat again but it was not quite enough for @entity5 to gain victory over the @entity8 champions at the @entity9 because of the enduring unorthodox brilliance of @entity11			1
it was an unbeaten 116 from @entity3 that enabled @entity5 to become the only team to defeat @entity0 in that world tournament in @entity16 in march			1
he appeared poised to do the same in the first big match of the @entity21 era			0
@entity3 smashed 66 off 41 balls to lift @entity5 within reach of their formidable target of 184			1
but @entity11 , still the best ‘ death bowler ’ in the world , deceived him with a perfect slower ball to earn @entity0 the spoils			1
vital : @entity11 and his @entity0 team - mates celebrate taking the wicket of @entity5 's @entity3 big hitter : @entity3 was in fine form against @entity0 at the @entity9 even then , @entity5 came close to pulling off what would have been a significant win in their first @entity8 international since defeat by @entity39 in @entity40			1
but an unbeaten 28 off 15 balls from @entity42 — again batting too low in the order at seven — came just too late to avert a nine - run defeat			2
it may have been the genius of @entity11 , now the @entity47 @entity8 captain , that gave his side the perfect start to their tour but @entity5 were left to rue a miserable error in the field which ultimately cost them dear			1
@entity53 seemed to talk his way out of an international future when he blasted @entity5 for his treatment in @entity57			2
he may wish they had taken offence rather than offered him another chance here , after this pivotal mishap			0
@entity5 , with an inexperienced attack in the absence of @entity64 , still managed to keep the gifted @entity47 hitters in check for the bulk of their innings			2
yet , once @entity53 shelled a dolly of a chance to reprieve @entity71 off his fellow debutant @entity72 , @entity0 managed to cut loose and hit 75 off their last six overs			2
@entity72 , whose elevation this year has owed something to injuries to fellow left - armers @entity78 and @entity79 , did little to impress on his one - day debut against @entity81 in @entity82			0
here he displayed intelligent variety in the face of threatening @entity47 hitting			0
disappointing : but @entity5 were defeated by @entity0 in the opening @entity8 international dominant : @entity11 celebrates taking the wicked of @entity89 in the second innings @entity72 claimed a notable first scalp in international cricket when he bowled @entity93			1
he added another in @entity95 before that blunder which cost him a third wicket and , more importantly , cost @entity5 the match			2
@entity5 had already put down two difficult catches — @entity100 and @entity101 offering lives to @entity103 — and seen @entity104 miss a difficult stumping before @entity71 hit @entity72 straight up into the air			2
it should have been a simple catch for any one of @entity72 , @entity108 or @entity53			0
sadly for @entity5 , it was the @entity111 man who took responsibility and duly let a regulation chance slip out of his grasp			0
‘ i was going for it initially and shouted for it , ’ said @entity108			0
‘ but as i got closer carbs was shouting his name so i stood as close to him as possible in case there was a rebound			0
people drop catches but it was costly			0
’ @entity53 has proved fallible in the field during his short international career and this miss was particularly painful			0
@entity71 , on 20 at the time , took full toll of the @entity5 bowling — smashing @entity133 for 22 off the 19th over and powering @entity0 to 183 for seven with 49 off 20 balls			1
the depth in the @entity47 batting , even without @entity137 and @entity138 , was demonstrated by the fact that five different players hit sixes			0
@entity71 smashed two of the six maximums that featured in the world champions ’ innings before he was run out off the final ball			0
the night was not to get any better for @entity53 after he got the nod to open alongside @entity3			0
he fell for seven as @entity5 began their attempt to stop @entity0 registering their ninth victory in 10 twenty20 internationals in this country			1
bad start : @entity53 struggled at the top of the order once again for @entity5 eye on the ball : @entity0 's @entity95 struck a valuable 40 for the visitors when @entity89 , @entity156 and then @entity108 — standing in for @entity64 here and expected to become full - time @entity8 captain later this year — soon followed , @entity5 had a mountain to climb			1
they came close to reaching the summit but @entity11 had too much nous and @entity5 can only hope to fare better here tomorrow in the first of five one - day internationals			1
the fact they will attempt to do so without @entity3 , whose technique is still considered too loose for the 50 - over game , might be something @entity5 care to look at again			1
comfortable : the visitors celebrate securing their nine - run victory with a new - look side leader : stand - in @entity5 skipper @entity108 directs play from the field			2

@entity0 win one - off @entity175 against @entity5 by nine runs at the @entity9
@entity3 hit 66 of 41 balls for the hosts
@entity11 took three wickets for @entity0
