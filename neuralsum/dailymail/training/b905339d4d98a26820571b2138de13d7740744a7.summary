most of us are guilty of zoning out as the cabin crew point out the emergency exits before our flight takes off			0
so what ’s the best way to grab our attention during the obligatory safety instructions ? how about performing the splits in mid-air ? one flight attendant made sure his enthusiastic demonstration on a recent @entity14 flight was impossible for passengers to ignore			1
several of the passengers look rather nonplussed at first , continuing to read or sip their drinks as the man jumps up and down beside them			0
but mr @entity23 perseveres , demonstrating how to fasten the seat belt and operate the oxygen mask while shimmying back and forth , waving his arms in the air			0
@entity40 hit : the flight attendant makes sure he gets everyone 's attention with a series of dramatic moves , including a high kick to the cabin ceiling and mid-air splits he then grabs a life jacket and dramatically drops to the floor to laughter in the cabin			1
clearly enjoying himself , he proceeds to point out the exits , striding up and down the cabin as if auditioning for a part in a @entity58 musical			0
he dramatically rounds off this segment of the demonstration with a high kick to the cabin ceiling to cries of ‘ @entity64 ! ’ from the passengers			2
grinning widely , he runs back down the cabin , arms outstretched , before returning to first class to perform his impressive finale - the splits in mid-air - to whoops and applause from the passengers			1
the routine was captured by passenger @entity75 from @entity76 who filmed mr @entity23 's exhausting dance moves on a flight from @entity79 to @entity76 a video of @entity23 performing a similar routine was also filmed on a flight from @entity76 to @entity83			1
he has clearly been putting his hobby to good use - the air steward is a figure skater in his spare time			2
commenting on @entity14 's website he said : ' @entity75 's video of my @entity91 made it onto the homepage of the @entity96 website ! @entity97 ! ! ! ! still so humbled and excited to get all this positive feedback ! ' new routine : the flight attendant 's moves mimic @entity14 's promotional video in which performers dance along to the safety instructions the flight attendant ’s snazzy moves mimic the airline ’s recent promotional video in which dancers and former @entity111 contestants sing , rap and dance along to the safety instructions			1
the video uses 14 different dance styles to spell out the pre-flight instructions and features singing air hostesses and dancing nuns			0
one air hostess says : ' for the .001 % of you who have never operated a seat belt before - really ? ' a new habit : the five - minute video by filmmaker @entity127 even features dancing nuns the video was created by filmmaker @entity127 who worked on @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity132 's @entity131 concert film @entity129 and @entity136 : retaliation			2
' the most important aspect of any safety video is that people actually pay attention to it			0
too often the dry , perfunctory safety messaging used in the past was tuned out ' , said mr @entity127			0
the @entity144 has a regulation dictating what has to be included in safety presentations			2
' we do n't care how you deliver it , as long as it 's imparted to passengers , ' said @entity144 spokeswoman @entity153 .			1
