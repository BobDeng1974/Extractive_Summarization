by @entity0 it is said that when a man marries his mistress , he creates a vacancy			0
and research suggests the saying may well be right			0
partners who are ‘ poached ’ from others are more likely to cheat in their new relationship , psychologists have found			0
relationships that are formed by stealing someone ’s partner are also more likely to be unhappy generally and are at a higher risk of break - up			1
partners who are ‘ poached ’ from others are more likely to cheat in their new relationship , psychologists from the @entity19 have found ( file pic ) scientists from the @entity19 asked 443 men and women how much they agreed with a series of statements to gauge their levels of commitment and satisfaction in their relationships			1
the statements included ‘ i am aware that there are plenty more “ fish in the sea ” ’ , ‘ i rarely notice other good - looking or attractive people ’ and ‘ our relationship makes me very happy ’			0
between 10 per cent and 30 per cent of participants in each of the studies said they were in relationships that began when they left one romantic partner for another			1
professor @entity46 , lead author of the studies by the @entity19 , said : ‘ individuals who were poached by their current romantic partners were less committed , less satisfied , and less invested in their relationships			1
scientists asked 443 men and women about their relationships ‘ they also paid more attention to romantic alternatives , perceived their alternatives to be of higher quality , and engaged in higher rates of infidelity compared to non-poached participants			1
’ the results , published in the @entity60 , also showed that those who left one partner for another were more likely to possess negative personality traits such as being self - absorbed , vain or arrogant , as the scientists expected			2
but they were surprised to find that ' introverts ' were more likely to be poached than extroverts			2
‘ the introversion finding was surprising because previous research suggested that people who get a lot of poaching attempts tend to have outgoing personalities ( they ’re extroverted ) , ’ professor @entity46 said			2
‘ but we found that people who are successfully poached are the opposite , that is socially passive			0
it might be that being outgoing puts you in a position to get a lot of attempts - perhaps simply because you ’re around people more - but being passive makes you more likely to go along with the attempts and actually get poached			0

relationships formed by ' poaching ' more likely to be unhappy , scientists say
introverts more likely to leave their partner for another as ' go along ' with it
