@entity1 justice @entity0 has said it would be absurd and facile to ban interrogators from torturing terror suspects			1
his controversial declaration comes amid outrage over a @entity8 report into @entity10 torture tactics , which found no life - saving information was extracted using brute force			1
speaking to a @entity14 radio station , @entity0 , 78 , said @entity16 and @entity17 liberals who say such tactics may never be used are being self - righteous			1
he said : ' listen , i think it 's very facile for people to say , " oh , torture is terrible "			1
you posit the situation where a person that you know for sure knows the location of a nuclear bomb that has been planted in @entity30 and will kill millions of people			2
' facile ' : @entity1 justice @entity0 said it would be simplistic to rule out torture of terror suspects ' you think it 's an easy question ? you think it 's clear that you can not use extreme measures to get that information out of that person ? ' @entity0 also said that while there are @entity16 laws against torture , nothing in the @entity43 appears to prohibit harsh treatment of suspected terrorists			1
' i do n't know what article of the @entity43 that would contravene , ' he said			1
the 30 - minute interview touched on a range of topics , including the financing of political campaigns , the death penalty and gay marriage , about which @entity0 said he should not comment because it is likely the court soon will have the issue before it			1
asked about money and @entity16 elections , @entity0 scoffed that ' women may pay more each year to buy cosmetics ' than is spent on local , state and federal elections combined			1
his comments about interrogation techniques echoed remarks he also has made to foreign audiences			2
in 2008 , he used the example of the hidden bomb			0
' it seems to me you have to say , as unlikely as that is , it would be absurd to say you could n't , i do n't know , stick something under the fingernail , smack him in the face			0
it would be absurd to say you could n't do that , ' he said			0
a year earlier , @entity85 's @entity84 newspaper reported that @entity0 invoked fictional tv counterterrorism agent @entity86 using torture to get terrorism suspects to reveal information that could help authorities foil an imminent attack			1
' is any jury going to convict @entity86 ? i do n't think so , ' he said			0
' so the question is really whether we believe in these absolutes			0
and ought we believe in these absolutes			0
' @entity0 is the latest to weigh in on the controversy			1
this week , a former @entity99 soldier who survived weeks of torture at the hands of @entity103 interrogators said the tactics can be used to prevent terrorists attacks			1
@entity106 believes security services have a ' moral responsibility ' to torture suspects if innocent lives hang in the balance			1
the soldier - turned - author says torture can yield vital information if used properly - and will be used by authorities in the future to prevent terrorist attacks			2
defence : @entity99 soldier - turned - author @entity106 ( right ) says torturing suspects , such as those held in @entity121 following the september 11 attacks ( left ) , is warranted if it saves lives immoral : a @entity16 @entity8 report concluded that torture techniques used by the @entity10 on @entity128 suspects ( pictured , file photo ) did not produce ' useful information ' evidence : a report released earlier this week revealed that brutal techniques used by @entity10 agents against @entity128 suspects in the wake of the september 11 bombings failed to produce useful intelligence			1
protest : human rights activists in @entity139 demonstrate ' water - boarding ' on a volunteer ( file photo ) the former @entity144 sergeant told @entity145 he ' would n't think twice ' about ' inflicting pain ' on someone if he thought it could prevent an atrocity such as the 2005 @entity151 bombings			1
he said : ' i would deem it a moral responsibility to interrogate , to physically torture him to get the information out			2
' torture is a really blunt instrument but it is an instrument that if it used right can yield results			2
' there will always be legislation to make sure that we do n't do it , but we will do it ... we could moan about tactical interrogation or we could moan about 24 - 28 people getting blown up on a tube			0
it 's a tough call			0
' @entity170 , @entity171 , admitted some agents had used ' unauthorised methods ' , but insists they gained some valuable information through techniques such as ' water - boarding ' - which was used to save lives			0
@entity106 , which is a pseudonym he coined after 20 years of military service , says there are a number of ' quick , harmful , painful techniques ' which can be used to effectively extract information from a captive			0
he conceded that he only supported the use of torture immediately after a suspect was captured rather than months later , when the information they possessed would be ' out of date '			2
tortured : @entity191 ( pictured ) , who 's believed to be the mastermind behind the september 11 attacks , was water - boarded 183 times justified : the director of the @entity10 , @entity171 ( pictured ) , defended the @entity16 spy agency 's use of torture - saying the information gained through punishment saved lives the former special forces officer was himself tortured by @entity103 forces , after being captured on covert mission during the first @entity204 in january 1991			1
he and three of his colleagues were taken to an interrogation centre in @entity208 where they were stripped of their clothing , beaten and held in isolation for over three weeks			0
each of the men were whipped until they bled - their wounds then sealed with a red - hot metal spoon			0
at one point , @entity106 , now 54 , says his molars were forcibly removed with pliers			0
he was eventually transferred to another prison in @entity221 where he was beaten for another three weeks			0
despite the unimaginable pain he was subjected to , @entity106 maintains that torture is ' a weapon misunderstood by those who were not inflicting or being subjected to it			2
he said : ' at the moment there is this moral revulsion at what has gone on			0
' however , if there was real time information that did actually save lives , we would be looking at it in a different way			0

@entity0 , 78 , said nothing in the @entity43 bans torture
told @entity14 radio station it would be simplistic to rule out brute force
comment come in the wake of @entity8 report showing @entity10 tactics ' failed '
