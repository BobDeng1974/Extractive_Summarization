by @entity0 published : 10:19 est , 4 april 2013 updated : 02:15 est , 5 april 2013 a disappointed cinema - goer has won a refund after complaining that the 2012 @entity4 thriller @entity5 did not include an explosion featured in its trailer			0
the @entity9 film buff , named only as @entity10 , complained to the country 's @entity11 that the missing explosion was ' the defining part of the ad '			1
the scene , which features in the trailer for less than a second , shows a huge detonation which dramatically brings down an entire cliff face			0
misleading advertising : a @entity9 film fan won a refund from @entity25 after noticing that a scene in the trailer for the @entity4 film @entity5 ( pictured ) did not appear in the final edit @entity25 , the film company behind @entity5 , admitted the error and agreed to refund the cost of mr @entity10 's ticket			1
it said the trailer for the action thriller was released before its final edit had been completed and , as a result , the ' split - second ' scene used to promote the film was cut before it made it to the cinema			1
but the studio nevertheless defended the trailer , which showed at least two further scenes not featured in the film 's final cut			1
mr @entity10 made his complaint after seeing the advert on television earlier this year , and noticing that the explosion in the trailer did not appear in the film 's final edit when he went to see it in the cinema			2
he told the @entity9 @entity11 that the ' explosion where the whole cliff comes down ' was ' the defining part of the ad that made me really want to go see the movie ... aside from having @entity4 in it			2
' @entity25 said it was a ' usual and longstanding practice in the film industry ' that cinema trailers and television advertisements be produced weeks or months before editing was complete , the @entity60 reported			0
' thus , despite our best intentions , it is always possible that certain scenes appearing in an advertisement or trailer may not appear in the final version of a film , ' the company told the @entity11			0
it added : ' the explosion in question was a single split - second element omitted from a 130 - minute long action film and [ we ] believe that , taken as a whole , the impression created by the advertisement was a true and fair reflection of the film which could not reasonably be considered misleading or deceptive to customers			0
' deleted scene : the missing explosion the fan called ' the defining part of the ad that made me really want to go see the movie ' although based on a series of best - selling novels , @entity5 had modest worldwide receipts of $ 212million , with the casting of @entity4 in the title role regarded a controversial choice			1
a signature feature of the novel 's lead character is that he is unusually tall , while @entity4 is only 5ft 6in			0
@entity100 contacted @entity25 to find out why the explosion did not make the final cut , but as yet we have received no response .			2

the scene in question appears for less than a second in the trailer
but film fan complains that it was ' defining part of the ad '
@entity25 admits error , but says trailers are often made before the final cut
