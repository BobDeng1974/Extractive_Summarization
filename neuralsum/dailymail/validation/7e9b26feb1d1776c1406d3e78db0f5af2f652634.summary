' and the ' reduction in the uninsured , ' @entity11 said , ' could be through any of a number of avenues			2
' @entity31 ? @entity1 secretary @entity32 presides over an @entity10 system that has managed so far to change the status of barely one - third of @entity5 's uninsured tax bite for many : portions of about 4.5 million @entity10 insurance subsidies will have to be paid back this year she listed a few , beginning with new coverage from empoyers – including among people who changed jobs – along with @entity44 and ' the individual market outside the [ @entity10 ] marketplace			1
