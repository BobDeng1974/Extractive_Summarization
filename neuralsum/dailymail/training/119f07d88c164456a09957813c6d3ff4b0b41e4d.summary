@entity0 believes @entity1 under @entity2 are a different proposition from the @entity5 side beaten by @entity6 last december			1
the @entity7 broke a 41 - year winless run at @entity9 when @entity10 scored the only goal 12 months ago			1
that defeat left @entity1 ninth and @entity5 under increasing pressure			2
@entity2 ( right ) has restored order at @entity1 , says @entity0 @entity0 takes his @entity6 troops to @entity17 looking for back - to - back wins at @entity9 @entity10 hit the winner last time out , but the @entity20 swapped @entity21 for @entity22 in summer @entity0 , though , believes @entity24 ’s presence has brought security to the club as well as the team			1
‘ you can sense a difference between last year and this year , ’ said the @entity6 manager			1
‘ last year they did n’t seem that secure around @entity5			1
but they ’ve definitely got it this year			2
there ’s a bit more stability with the manager			1
there was a lot of unstable reporting and messages coming out of there last year and for @entity5 that was n’t working			1
‘ @entity24 has had more patience and more time , and more assurance about what ’s going on from above			1
that makes them look as though more good news is going to be arriving than bad			0
‘ i think the board have made a statement that @entity24 ’s the man and he ’s made it very clear he ’s their man too			1
‘ put that together and they ’ve got a great base for those great players , those great strikers			0
‘ he ’s had terrible injuries , like ourselves , but they ’ve got a great chance of getting back in the @entity63 and that ’s what i think they ’re pushing for			2
’ @entity6 will again start with 21 - year - old goalkeeper @entity67			1
and that , says @entity0 , is a stark contrast to @entity1 ’s @entity70 , who he believes is challenging @entity72 ’s @entity71 as the world ’s no 1 between the posts			1
following his dream debut against @entity77 , @entity67 has found life tougher between the sticks @entity70 has been a rock at the last line of defence for @entity1 , pulling off a string of sensational saves ‘ there ’s such a contrast in goal at the moment — @entity67 is on his third @entity90 start and @entity70 is pushing @entity71 for the title of being the best goalkeeper in the world , ’ he said			2
‘ he ’s a fantastic shot - stopper			0
he still has parts of his game that he wishes to develop , but in one - on - one situations he excels			0
‘ he covers a lot of the areas goalscorers want to score in by doing so with his feet and his hands			0
‘ he makes it very difficult to score , so you have to go with power and go for the corners			0
’ @entity6 , meanwhile , are on the back of three straight defeats and they last won when upsetting @entity63 leaders @entity77 2 - 1 on december 6			2
but @entity0 ( below ) is refusing to panic			2
‘ against the top teams we ’ve done well , we ’re ninth in the division and we ’re not far away from the top , ’ he said			0
‘ if we get a win today it ’s then @entity120 and @entity121 at home and it could put us in a great position			0
so it ’s all to play for			0
i do think this team is stable , it ’s a strong middle - of - the - @entity90 team and we need to be better than that if we can			0
‘ i think this january is important			0
it ’s important that big players come back to us — and we do some business			0

@entity6 won at @entity9 last *season* with @entity131 under @entity5

' last year they did *n't* seem that secure around @entity5 . but they *'ve* definitely got it this year . there ’s a bit more stability with the manager , ' he says
