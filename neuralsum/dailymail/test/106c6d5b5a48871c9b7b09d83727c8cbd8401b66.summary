the continents of @entity1 came together much earlier than previously thought , according to researchers who found evidence in rock deposits from ancient rivers in @entity6 of the land bridge that connected the long - isolated landmasses			1
the two continents are linked at @entity10 , but there has been a debate about when this land bridge first appeared , with most experts placing its formation at about 3 million years ago			1
the new study , published on thursday in the journal @entity17 , presents evidence that the @entity10 land bridge formed at least 10 million years earlier			1
before the @entity20 of @entity10 rose from the sea by tectonic and volcanic action , the @entity19 linked the @entity23 to the @entity24 as one great ocean			1
the various continents , sitting atop huge plates akin to jigsaw puzzle pieces sliding over @entity30 's mantle , have slowly moved around the globe during the planet 's history			1
they have separated , drifted and joined numerous times in a process called plate tectonics			1
@entity1 became an isolated landmass when it separated from @entity39			2
likewise , @entity40 broke apart from @entity41 and headed on a gradual collision course with @entity1			0
until then , a deep water channel called the @entity19 separated the continents			1
the researchers base their estimate on the presence of small grains of a mineral called zircon unearthed in ancient river bedrock in northern @entity6 that originated in @entity10 and were 13 million to 15 million years old			1
these grains suggested the land bridge must have existed at that time , they said			0
' we contend that a bridge , perhaps a transient one , was present since 13 to 15 million years ago , ' said geologist @entity57 of @entity58 in @entity59 , who led the study			1
' beds younger than about 13 to 15 million years contain abundant zircon grains with a typically @entity10 age , ' said @entity57			2
' older beds do not			0
' we think these zircons were deposited by rivers flowing from the @entity67 when it docked to @entity1 , nearly 10 million years earlier than the date of 3 million years that is usually given for the connection			2
' the various continents , sitting atop huge plates akin to jigsaw puzzle pieces sliding over @entity30 's mantle , have slowly moved around the globe during the planet 's history			2

@entity1 became an isolated landmass when it separated from @entity39			2
likewise , @entity40 broke apart from @entity41 and headed on a gradual collision course with @entity1			0
one of the most dramatic results of the joining of the two @entity1 was the mixing of the animals living on the respective landmasses , with various creatures crossing the land bridge to invade the other continent			0
the event is known as the @entity92			0
after the @entity20 of @entity10 formed , animals and plants could move back and forth between continents , the @entity92			2
@entity97 scientists are debating when this happened			0
@entity1 had a unique animal population , with exotic marsupials including saber - toothed predators , as well as elephant - sized ground sloths , car - sized armadillos , camel - like creatures with elephant trunks and giant flightless , carnivorous ' terror birds			0
' @entity40 had a quite different and impressive array of placental mammals including saber - toothed cats and other feline predators , huge short - faced bears , wolves and various herbivores including big elephant relatives and horses			0
the two continents continue to move together			0
' yes , the plates are moving today , ' @entity57 said			0

researchers had previously believed continents connected *3m* years ago
