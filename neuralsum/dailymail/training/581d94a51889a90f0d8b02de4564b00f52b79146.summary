by @entity0 published : 17:08 est , 8 september 2012 updated : 18:24 est , 8 september 2012 tougher laws : @entity0 is @entity2 mp for @entity3 and an ex @entity5 colonel in 1999 , the @entity7 farmer @entity6 killed one of my constituents and injured another when they went to burgle his farm			2
quite rightly , mr @entity6 was prosecuted and served time in prison but the case became a cause celebrate			2
last sunday , @entity15 and his wife @entity16 from @entity17 used a legally - held shotgun to defend themselves against a number of men who are alleged to have broken into their property			2
two of them were wounded and the @entity26 were held and questioned by police for more than two days before being released at the behest of the @entity29			2
now , the two cases are very different , but there is one important similarity â€“ the law does not protect householders from intrusion in the way i believe that it should			1
in 2004 , i initiated a @entity38 that would have solved the problem			0
after the @entity6 case , there had been a very important change in civil law			1
@entity44 , my constituent who had been wounded in the burglary , attempted to sue mr @entity6 for the injuries that he caused			1
as civil law then stood , he would have to prove that mr @entity6 had used ' unreasonable force '			1
very quickly , though , the government of the day amended civil law and raised the threshold using the phrase ' grossly disproportionate ' force			1
my @entity38 was designed to bring criminal law into step with civil law			1
@entity57 , the then @entity58 , drafted a simple amendment which would have the effect of giving ordinary householders the protection of the ' grossly disproportionate ' proviso			0
legal protection : @entity44 , right , attempted to sue @entity6 , left it seemed at one stage that the @entity67 had the support of @entity69 and the then @entity71 police commissioner			1
@entity44 even told my local newspaper that such a change in the law would deter him from breaking and entering in future			1
the whole issue was immensely popular			0
my @entity67 was scuppered by a disgraceful piece of chicanery from the @entity79			0
i was delighted , then , when the conservative manifesto in 2010 said : ' we will give householders greater legal protection if they have to defend themselves against intruders in their own homes			0
' such promises were not contained in the @entity87 although the @entity87 has tweaked the law a little further			1
but it 's cases such as that of the ferries that must cause decisive action to be taken now			0
this need can only be underlined by the extraordinary statement from judge @entity96 last week who apparently told an offender that ' it takes a huge amount of courage ... for somebody to burgle somebody 's house '			0
it is an astounding statement and the prime minister , absolutely properly , condemned it completely			0
but he also went on to say ' that 's why this government is changing the law to toughen the rules on self defence towards burglars '			1
really ? it 's two years later and yet we still do not have the ' grossly disproportionate ' phrase enshrined in criminal law			2
released : @entity15 and @entity117 were held for more than two days by police i do n't want householders to be given a licence to butcher intruders in their homes , but i do want normal people to feel that the law is unquestionably on their side and not on that of the criminals			1
i also want the police and the @entity29 to be confident about not putting people like the @entity26 through days of anguish when such anguish should be reserved for offenders			2
when they were in @entity135 , the @entity134 seemed very clear about what needed to be done			0
indeed , many of my @entity67 's greatest supporters are now in power			0
yet , something is stopping them from putting their earlier words into action			0
the government needs to listen , not just to decent people , but to burglars like @entity44 and change the law now			1
@entity0 is @entity2 mp for @entity3 and ex @entity5 colonel			0

' i want normal people to feel that the law is unquestionably on their side '
' the government needs to listen , not just to decent people , but to burglars like @entity44 '
