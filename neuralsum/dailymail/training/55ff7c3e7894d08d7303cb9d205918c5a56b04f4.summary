by @entity0 , @entity1 editor ministers have been condemned as ‘ shameful ’ and ‘ devious ’ after they blocked international efforts to ban plastic bags			1
@entity5 once claimed his government would be the ‘ greenest ever ’ , and signed up to efforts to reduce the number of throwaway bags handed out at tills			2
but it has emerged that ministers have been secretly working behind the scenes in @entity13 to kill off controls			0
@entity15 had brought in controls in 2011 after study found 73 % of man - made waste on coast was plastic bags @entity21 blocked the ban citing @entity24 law , despite the dangers plastic bags cause to wildlife in @entity21 and abroad they have used the @entity24 legal system to overturn the @entity15 government ’s ban on thin plastic bags in their own country			1
in 2011 , @entity15 brought in controls on plastic bags following studies which found that they made up 73 per cent of the man - made waste settling on the sea bed around its coast			1
but the @entity21 claims this is illegal under @entity42 law			1
its intervention has stopped the measure in its tracks – and prevented other @entity42 governments from adopting similar schemes			2
@entity21 ’s decision has apparently put the commercial interests of plastic bag manufacturers ahead of the need to tackle litter , blight and harm to wildlife			1
it contradicts pledges made by mr @entity5 and @entity58 dating back to february 2008 , when they offered their support to the @entity62 ’s ‘ @entity63 ’ campaign			1
@entity15 ministers and environmental campaigners are furious about the role played by the government			2
@entity15 ’s environment minister , @entity68 , said : ‘ the bags are a serious problem , above all at sea , and it is astounding that @entity21 , which is serious about the environment and has a seafaring tradition going back centuries , does not want to defend the seas from plastic pollution which suffocates and kills many marine animals			1
’ the @entity62 campaigned against the use of plastic bags for five years and it was backed by @entity5 and @entity58 conservative mp @entity81 , who at one time was an adviser on green issues to the prime minister , condemned the government ’s failure to tackle ‘ plastic poison ’ bags			1
he said : ‘ it is bad enough that the government ’s rhetoric on this issue is miles away from any meaningful action , but using @entity24 bureaucracy to stop other nations doing the right thing is just shameful			2
the sheer deviousness of this latest move will be surprising even to cynics amongst us			0
’ dr @entity101 , of the @entity102 , said : ‘ it seems extraordinary that a government that has badged itself as the greenest ever should seek to stop a ban on carrier bags			0
‘ it seems hypocritical to agree on the one hand that something needs to be done to reduce the number of carrier bags given out in the @entity21 and on the other to block a ban on bags in @entity15			1
’ the department for environment , food and rural affairs , run by @entity119 secretary of state @entity120 , and the business department , run by @entity124 @entity123 , could not agree on who was responsible for blocking the ban			0
@entity119 mp @entity81 , right , who once advised @entity5 , left , on green issues , condemned @entity91 's failure to tackle ' plastic poison ' bags @entity102 called the government ' hypocritical ' for its stance on the @entity15 ban eight billion plastic bags are issued in the @entity21 - more than six billion are used in @entity134 both claimed they were simply trying to uphold @entity42 packaging laws and protect the interests of @entity21 manufacturers			1
a government spokesman said : ‘ while we are determined to tackle the blight caused by discarded carrier bags , the proposed @entity15 scheme is illegal under @entity24 packaging laws			1
’ but many countries have introduced charges for bags in an attempt to cut down on their use			0
the @entity152 government introduced a 5p charge on plastic bags in october 2011 , reducing the number handed out at tills by 90 per cent and raising tens of thousands of pounds for good causes			2
@entity158 brought in its own 5p charge earlier this year , while the @entity160 is expected to follow suit			0
dr @entity101 said : ‘ although this block came from “ @entity21 ” or the “ @entity21 ” i am sure that @entity152 and @entity158 – which already have bag levies and @entity166 which is considering one – would not agree with this position			0
‘ yet again @entity134 is left isolated on this issue as the only part of the @entity21 not to be doing anything to reduce the number of bags			2
‘ perhaps they should get their own house in order before interfering with others			0
’ ministers have stood by while the number of plastic bags given out at tills in @entity134 has risen dramatically over the past two years			1
currently , around eight billion single use bags are issued by stores across the @entity21 each year			2
@entity134 accounts for 6.77billion of these			0
the majority end up in landfill where it is estimated they can take up to 1,000 years to rot away , while others are discarded to blight streets , seas and the countryside			0
once in the environment , they are a threat to birds , dolphins , whales and turtles			0
the @entity62 ’s @entity200 campaign , launched in 2008 , won the backing of politicians from all parties as well as countryside and clean - up groups			1
at the time , @entity206 took the lead by introducing a 5p charge across the country , cutting billions of bags and raising cash to clean up green spaces and beaches			0
earlier this year , leaders from @entity215 , the @entity216 , the @entity102 and @entity217 met environment minister @entity218 to call for action to introduce charges in @entity134			0
but he brushed their concerns off , and promised no action beyond monitoring how the schemes work in @entity152 , @entity158 and @entity166 .			0

@entity21 ministers used @entity24 law to overturn @entity15 's ban on thin plastic bags
intervention stops measure from being adopted elsewhere in @entity42
@entity5 backed @entity62 's @entity200 campaign in 2008
mp @entity81 condemned failure to tackle ' plastic poison ' bags
government claims it is trying to protect interests of @entity21 manufacturers
@entity134 uses 6.77billion of the *8billion* plastic bags issued in @entity21
