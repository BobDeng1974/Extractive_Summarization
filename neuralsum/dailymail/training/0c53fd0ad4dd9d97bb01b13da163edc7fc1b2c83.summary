by @entity0 published : 04:26 est , 9 october 2012 updated : 06:53 est , 9 october 2012 hundreds of miners are set to lose their jobs by @entity3 as one of @entity6 's few remaining coal mines looks set to close			1
the 540 workers at @entity8 , near @entity9 , @entity10 , have been given 90 day ' potential redundancy ' notices by its owners			1
@entity15 blames serious geological problems for the closure of the 100 - year - old pit , which he says makes mining there dangerous			1
closure : @entity22 in @entity10 , where 540 redundancies have been announced there are only around five mines like this one left in the @entity6 - around 30 years ago there were more than 150			1
@entity29 had been producing more than a million tonnes of coal a year , much of it going to @entity32 , @entity28 's largest coal fired power plants			1
last month unusually high levels of water , oil and gas were found at the site and the owners warned about the possible closure			2
painful : @entity29 is one of @entity6 's few remaining mines and the local community has expressed its sorrow at the decision difficult : more than 500 miners at the colliery could lose their jobs by @entity3 @entity48 , from @entity15 , said : ' we have got reports that will be coming to us in a number of weeks which will advise us on all the various risk profiles associated with the geological problems and it 's only when our board is in full possession of all the data that any decision will be properly made			1
' @entity60 , @entity61 @entity62 , @entity63 @entity64 , @entity10 @entity29 , @entity10 @entity65 , @entity63 a statement from the company added : ' initiating this process is considered to be prudent business practice and does not indicate that a decision on the future of @entity29 has been taken			1
the relevant @entity73 department is being notified			0
' @entity74 still expects to receive reports later in october that will advise on the geological , financial and health and safety risks			2
the decision by the @entity74 on the future of the colliery will be based on the conclusions of these reports			0
' local people are distressed at the news			0
chairman of @entity88 @entity87 said : ' i 'm absolutely gutted			0
i 've heard this news and i ca n't believe they 're going to close the colliery			0
' when @entity94 had a similar problem three years ago they had faith in the workforce to get through , and since @entity94 took over at @entity22 they 've made a profit every year			2
' last year they made Â£ 34m worth of profit , so i think it 's time @entity94 gave the workforce down at @entity22 some support			0
' as owners of the historic @entity29 pit issued redundancy notices to its 540 miners today , the @entity10 colliery is one in a very long line to close in recent years			1
the last three decades have seen an incredible decline in numbers , with hundreds of mines running before the infamous miners ' strike of the 1980s			0
despite union leaders claiming victory and saving some mines , the industrial action was followed by pit closure after pit closure			2
ten deaths were linked to the strike : six picketers , three teenagers searching for coal , and a taxi driver taking a non-striking miner to work			0
after the year - long action ended some 156 alone have been shut , and in 1985 at least 25 were closed including @entity131 - the @entity10 pit where the strike actually began ( pictured above right ) within seven years nearly a hundred had gone forever and now there are only around 5 deep pits with a small number of shallow mines			1
many closed were filled with concrete , turned into museums or left because owners believed that they could be re-opened - but most never did			1
engineer @entity142 who was the last person out of @entity143 in @entity63 when it closed in 1993 said simply : ' when a pit is shut it 's shut for good			2
' it was a bit sad being the last men out of there but the worst part was when the time came to switch off the fans , ' he told the @entity154			0
' everything just fell silent and that 's when i knew it was absolutely dead			0

@entity29 pit in @entity10 produces a million tonnes a year but could shut by @entity3
it is one of only about five large mines left in the @entity6
owners blame geological problems - making it unsafe to mine
