the man who predicted the 1987 stock market crash and the recent global economic recession believes the worst crash in decades will take place later in the next 12 months			1
dr @entity5 , a @entity7 investor and the author of the @entity9 , said the cause of the crash would be overvaluing of companies within the internet and biotechnology sectors – thought to include the $ 400billion valuation of @entity16 , and the $ 100billion valuation of @entity18			1
he also said the market was also beginning to wake up to the idea that the @entity21 is a ‘ clueless organisation ’ – something he says is starting to affect confidence levels in investors			1
cost : dr @entity5 said the cause of the '' 87 - type crash ' he is predicting would be wild overvaluing of companies within the internet and biotechnology sectors speaking to @entity32 last night , dr @entity5 said : ‘ i think it 's very likely that we 're seeing , in the next 12 months , an ' 87 - type of crash ’ … and i suspect it will be even worse			1
’ his comments came as the @entity40 suffered its biggest drop in two - and - a - half years after another sharp selloff in biotechnology businesses - including @entity44 and @entity45			0
the @entity40 biotechnology index shed 5.6 per cent of its value - its biggest one - day drop since august 2011 - increasing investor anxiety about a broader pullback in technology businesses			0
speaking of overvaluations in the technology sector , dr @entity5 told @entity32 's @entity55 programme : ' i think there are some groups of stocks that are highly vulnerable because they 're in cuckoo land in terms of valuations			2
' ' they have no earnings			0
they 're valued at price - to - sales			0
and this is not a good metric in the long run , ' he added			0
high values : in august last year the social network @entity18 was valued at a staggering $ 100billion fall : dr @entity5 's comments came as the @entity40 suffered its biggest drop in two - and - a - half years after another sharp selloff in biotechnology businesses - including @entity44 and @entity45 dr @entity5 said overvaluations would not be the only cause of the '' 87 - type of crash ' he is predicting , adding that the @entity21 would have to shoulder just as much blame			1
' i believe that the market is slowly waking up to the fact that the @entity21 is a clueless organization ... they have no idea what they 're doing			2
and so the confidence level of investors is diminishing , in my view ' dr @entity5 said			2
he said that as investors come to terms with the @entity21 's failings , the market will experience a decline by 20 or 30 per cent			0
despite dr @entity5 's track record for predicting economic crises , there are many that disagree with his conclusion that ' now is not a good time to buy stocks '			2
just last week @entity104 - the legendary stockpicker and chairman and chief investment officer at @entity107 - said the conditions for a bad market ' simply do not exist '			0
dr @entity5 also made a prediction last august that a stock market crash was imminent , but @entity113 stock prices have remained around 9 per cent high since that announcement .			1

dr @entity5 , a @entity7 investor , says an ' 87 - type crash ' is coming
