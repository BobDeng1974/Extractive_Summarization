in 2011 astronomers announced they had discovered a gas cloud known as @entity2 drifting around the supermassive black hole at the @entity5 's core			1
while the cloud had been observed orbiting the black hole its origins , however , were unknown			0
but now astronomers have found that the cloud is in an orbit matching another gas cloud - suggesting both may have been ejected by a star as it orbits the black hole			1
a cloud at the @entity5 's core could be form a star , say astronomers			1
in this image the red part of the @entity2 cloud is seen in orbit around the black hole ( path shown in solid white )			1
the blue part is the second cloud , @entity27			0
the distance from red to blue is 900 times the @entity32 - sun distance			0
they may have come from star @entity34 the new research , made possible using the @entity37 in @entity38 , was presented by astronomers at the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) near @entity41 , @entity42			1
at the centre of our @entity5 is a supermassive black hole called @entity46			2
most galaxies are believed to have such an object at their core			0
@entity46 lurks 26,000 light years away in the @entity5 's innermost region			1
for a black hole , it is very dim - about a billion times fainter than others of its supermassive types - making it something of a mystery			0
black holes eat matter from their surroundings and blow matter back			2
the way they do that influences the evolution of the entire galaxy			0
its interaction with the gas clouds @entity27 and @entity2 will give astronomers a unique opportunity to see how faint supermassive black holes ' feed '			1
they hope to understand these black holes do n't consume matter in the same way as their brighter counterparts in other galaxies			2
the findings could shed light on how stars are formed , how the galaxy grows and how it interacts with other galaxies			0
but finding a gas cloud in orbit around the black hole was odd , as it was not obvious where it could have come from			1
the new research , though , shows that the gas cloud @entity2 lags behind another , dubbed @entity27 , by about 13 @entity32 years			1
both are in a similar orbit , suggesting they are part of the same stream of gas - and they may just be one in a series of gas clouds deposited around the black hole by a star			1
the best model to explain the gas clouds now is that they originate from the wind of a massive star that also orbits the black hole			1
this star is labelled @entity34 , and it may be shedding material as it makes its way around the huge gravitational phenomenon			0
if confirmed , the cloud would provide a fascinating insight into what happens when stars orbit a black hole			2
all black holes are known to have an event horizon around their core , within which nothing - not even light - can escape			2
but this star in question orbits beyond the event horizon , so it only feels the effects of the black hole from a greater distance			0
at the centre of our @entity5 is a supermassive black hole ( illustration shown ) called @entity46			0
most galaxies are believed to have such an object at their core			0
its interaction with the gas clouds @entity27 and @entity2 will give astronomers a unique opportunity to see how faint supermassive black holes ' feed ' the new research , made possible using the @entity37 in @entity38 , was presented by astronomers at the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) near @entity41 , @entity42			1
they observed the supermassive black hole at the heart of the @entity5 , seen in this illustration in 2013 , the @entity2 gas cloud made its closest approach to the black hole , a distance of 20 light hours - about five times the distance of our sun to @entity153			1
. it is on a highly eccentric orbit , so will now begin to move out to a much greater distance from the black hole			0
and it follow a path already carved out by its companion , @entity27 , which could provide information about its origins			0
' already a decade ago , another gas cloud - which we now call @entity27 - has been observed in the central region of our galaxy , ' said dr @entity167 from mpe in a statement			2
' we explored the connection between @entity27 and @entity2 and find an astonishing similarity in both orbits			0
' the @entity2 gas cloud ( illustration shown ) was first spotted in 2011 , but since then astronomers have debated its origins			1
some have suggested it may have come from a star surrounded by a gas cloud , but this latest research says it is more likely it is ejected material from a star the latest findings were made using the @entity37 in @entity38 ( shown )			1
here a laser beam launched from the @entity37 s 26.9ft ( 8.2 - metre ) @entity184 telescope crosses the majestic southern sky and creates an artificial star at an altitude of 56 miles ( 90km ) to correct images from the blurring effect of the atmosphere dr @entity192 , also of mpe and lead author of the study , added : ' our basic idea is that @entity27 and @entity2 might be clumps of the same gas streamer			2
' in this case , we should be able to simultaneously fit both data sets and , indeed , our model captures the @entity27 and @entity2 orbits remarkably well			0
' a likely source for both @entity27 and @entity2 could be clumps in the wind of one of the massive disk stars , which could have been ejected some 100 years ago			0
another possible explanation that has been suggested recently would be a large star , enveloped by an extended gas cloud			2
based on current data , however , this model is highly unlikely			0
whatever the answer turns out to be , though , it could reveal a fascinating insight into some of the goings on near the black hole at the @entity5 's core .			1

astronomers at the @entity222 in @entity42 have provided a new theory for a gas cloud spotted in orbit around the @entity5 's core
the cloud dubbed @entity2 could be part of a stream of gas from a star
they made the discovery by finding another cloud in a similar orbit
it suggests both originate from the wind of a nearby star
finding could help explain how black holes ' feed '
