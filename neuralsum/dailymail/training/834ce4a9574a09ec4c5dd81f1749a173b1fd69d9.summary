security experts have warned for months that smart cars are vulnerable to hackers , and now a pair of researchers has revealed the specific vehicles that are at the greatest risk			1
@entity7 and @entity8 studied the schematics for a range of cars from the 2006 @entity12 to this year 's @entity13			1
the 2014 @entity14 and 2015 @entity15 were the most vulnerable of the cars studied , while the 2006 @entity17 and 2010 @entity12 were listed as two of the most secure			1
according to the report , the 2014 @entity14 ( pictured ) and 2015 @entity15 were the most vulnerable of the cars studied mr @entity8 is a security engineer at @entity30 , and mr @entity7 is director of @entity31 at @entity32			1
other cars that performed poorly in their tests were the 2010 and 2014 @entity36 , as well as the 2014 @entity37			1
the report has been shared with the @entity39 and industry group , the @entity41			2
each car was rated under three categories – attack surface , network architecture and cyber physical			2
a car ’s wireless ‘ attack surface ’ includes the range of features that can be hacked , including @entity49 , @entity50 , mobile network connections , key fobs , and tyre pressure monitoring systems			2
the network architecture includes how much access these features give to a vehicle ’s critical systems , such as the horn , the steering and brakes			0
cyber physical relates to capabilities such as automated braking and parking sensors that can be controlled using wireless commands			0
‘ automotive security concerns have gone from the fringe to the mainstream with security researchers showing the susceptibility of the modern vehicle to local and remote attacks , ’ said mr @entity7 and mr @entity8			1
the 2006 @entity17 ( pictured ) and the 2006 and 2010 @entity12 were listed as two of the most secure vehicles studied ‘ a malicious attacker leveraging a remote vulnerability could do anything from enabling a microphone for eavesdropping to turning the steering wheel to disabling the brakes			1
‘ unfortunately , research has only been presented on three or four particular vehicles			2
‘ each manufacturer designs their fleets differently ; therefore analysis of remote threats must avoid generalities			0
‘ [ our research ] takes a step back and examines the automotive network of a large number of different manufacturers from a security perspective			0
the results were published in a 92 - page report presented at the @entity100 conference in @entity101			1
mr @entity8 and mr @entity7 were the same researchers who demonstrated hacking a @entity36 and a @entity103 last year			1
each car was rated for attack surface , network architecture and cyber physical			2
a car ’s ‘ attack surface ’ includes features that can be hacked			0
network architecture includes how much access these features give to steering and brakes			0
cyber physical covers automated functions			0
the 2015 @entity15 is pictured using a laptop wirelessly connected to the car 's electronics , they were able to remotely control the brakes , the accelerator , change the speedometer , switch the headlights on and off , tighten the seatbelts and even blast the horn			1
the project was funded by a grant from the @entity129 to highlight the security risks affecting modern - day cars			0
@entity132 told @entity133 that the researchers did n’t physically hack the car , but said it is looking into the claims			0
this was also true for @entity138			0
@entity139 has contacted the other manufacturers mentioned for their view on the findings .			0

experts @entity7 and @entity8 studied 20 car makes and models
using schematics , they *assessed* the vehicles for signs of vulnerabilities
results were published in a 92 - page report and presented at the @entity100 conference in @entity101
2014 @entity14 and 2015 @entity15 were the most vulnerable
meanwhile , the 2006 @entity17 and 2010 @entity12 were listed as two of the most secure
