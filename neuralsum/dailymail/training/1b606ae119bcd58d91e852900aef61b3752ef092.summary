@entity0 are introducing £ 9.99 caviar to target their upmarket rivals such as @entity3 caviar has always been associated with the high life			1
but now the unlikeliest supermarket is to stock the luxury item on its shelves in the run up to @entity10			1
discounter @entity0 , better known for selling potatoes at a bargain basement 69p a kilo , is to sell @entity15 caviar costing £ 9.99 per 20 grams			1
the move is part of a plan to step up its battle for a bigger slice of the luxury market as it takes on upmarket rivals such as @entity3 by increasing and improving its selection of goods aimed at affluent consumers			1
it comes as plans to open 65 new stores across the country were announced , with the company 's sales soaring by 30 per cent to more than £ 5billion in 2013			1
the change in produce is particularly noticeable in the @entity36 - owned chain ’s @entity10 range			1
it will sell fresh scallops for the first time at £ 4.99 per 240 grams , and fresh dressed crab at £ 3.99 for two			1
there will also be a whole goose at £ 35.99 as well as a five bird roast ( @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , chicken , wrapped in bacon ) at £ 9.99			1
many of these items tend to be in short supply which critics say @entity0 uses to lure shoppers through its doors			0
@entity0 made its name with cut - price own - brand household products but now offers a range of upmarket coffees , steaks , olive oils and wine , as well as award - winning champagne and gin			0
its premium range of products saw sales grow 74 per cent as it attracts more middle class shoppers			1
it ’s success has seen soaring profits and sales as it gains market share from rivals such as troubled @entity90 , and @entity91 ’s			1
figures released today show @entity0 has beaten all of the big four grocers in terms of the rate it is growing profits			0
pre-tax profit jumped 65.2 per cent to £ 260.9million for the year to december 31 , 2013 from £ 157.9million			1
@entity0 opened 42 new stores last year and is on course to open 54 this year , with another 60 - 65 new stores planned to open in 2015			1
this will take total @entity103 store numbers to over 600 , keeping it on course to have 1,000 by 2022			0
it recruited 9,000 new members of staff in the @entity103 in 2013 , including more than 291 apprentices and 165 graduates			0
' the company expects to have more than 7,000 new workers in 2014 , including 500 in apprenticeships and 160 in graduate positions			0
@entity0 made its name with cut - price own - brand household products but now offers a range of upmarket coffees , steaks , olive oils and wine , as well as award - winning champagne and gin mr @entity60 said : ' in addition to new store openings , we ’ll be upgrading existing stores to meet customer demand			2
' we ’re investing over £ 600 million in our operations over the next two years to support this growth			2
' this means we can grow while always giving customers the service , value and award - winning quality they expect at @entity0			0
' the @entity0 group now has more than 7,000 stores across three continents			2
@entity0 's history began in a small grocer 's shop in the mining town of @entity143 in @entity36 opened in 1914 by @entity144 , by 1948 , her sons @entity147 and @entity148 had taken it to four other locations in the country , and in 1954 , the first self - service shop was opened			2
the brothers had a falling out in 1960 over whether or not to sell cigarettes in stores , and the brand was split into @entity0 and @entity0			2
in 1971 , @entity157 was kidnapped for 17 days and held to a ransom of $ 3million			0
the @entity157 family has remained notoriously private since			0
@entity160 is now in his nineties and was listed @entity36 's richest man by @entity163 last year			1
the brand 's name is a combination of the family 's and the word discount			2
after branches were opened in @entity171 , the first store in @entity103 welcomed shoppers in 1990			0
it now has more than 500 across the world			0
despite the encouraging figures , the chain is suffering along with many of its rivals from the price war it sparked			2
its profit growth is half the 123.9 per cent it achieved in 2012			2
this is because @entity0 has also been forced to slash its prices to keep ahead of the supermarkets , such as @entity90 and @entity185 , which joined it in dropping prices			0
@entity60 , @entity0 ’s joint managing director , said : ‘ we are delighted with the 65 per cent growth but yes it is a reduction			1
we continue to reduce profit margins by investing in sharper prices , but this is more than offset by our economies of scale			0
‘ we invest in prices to maintain the [ price ] gap which will have a short term impact on the bottom line			0
we will remain the price leader			0
we have reduced them [ prices ] in line with the market – we wo n’t let them [ rival supermarkets ] close the gap on @entity0			2
’ the drop in price has boosted the number of customers more than one million more than this time last year , increasing total sales for the group by 35.7 per cent to £ 5.2billion from £ 3.8billion			1
however this too is slower growth than the 40.6 per cent seen the previous year			1
the fact that @entity0 is also seeing something of a slowdown is a sign of just how tough it is for the grocers at the moment			0
new data out last week showed that overall grocery market growth slowed to a record low of 0.3 per cent as the average basket of everyday goods bought today cost exactly the same as it did a year ago			1
@entity60 said : ‘ it is a tough market out there , spending is going backwards on groceries			0
’ @entity0 is testing a new larger store format at 1,254 square metres and plans to increase its store numbers from 530 to 1,000 by 2021 , employing 50,000 staff .			0
