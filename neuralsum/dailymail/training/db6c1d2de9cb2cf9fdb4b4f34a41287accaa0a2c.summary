children with genetic material from three parents could be born from next year , after mps voted to legalise the controversial technique			1
in a highly - charged debate yesterday , critics warned there was ‘ no going back ’ from allowing a couple to use an egg donor ’s dna to prevent genetic disease			1
but @entity3 voted by 382 to 128 for the procedure after hearing it could be the ‘ light at the end of a very dark tunnel ’ for families blighted by incurable conditions			2
hope : @entity18 and @entity19 with their one - year - old daughter @entity20 these diseases , such as muscular dystrophy , affect one in 6,500 and are passed down in the mother ’s mitochondria , the ‘ batteries ’ that power the body ’s cells			1
@entity30 scientists devised the new @entity32 technique , in which the child has genetic material from three people , but does not inherit any of the donor ’s characteristics			1
the @entity30 would be the first country to legalise the procedure			1
opponents include the @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 @entity30			1
they say permanently altering a person ’s genetic make - up has huge ethical consequences and raises concerns about a slippery slope to designer babies			2
but supporters , including the prime minister , said it will give couples who have endured repeatedly miscarrying , or burying their children , the option of a healthy family			2
@entity30 scientists devised the new @entity32 technique , in which the child has genetic material from three people , but does not inherit any of the donor ’s characteristics			1
opponents include the @entity40 @entity64 said : ‘ as someone who has had the experience of having a severely disabled child [ @entity67 , who died six years ago ] i have every sympathy with those parents			1
' the people arguing that we are fiddling with nature in a profound way , i think are quite wrong			2
we are not playing @entity75 , we are just making sure that all parents who want a healthy baby can have one			2
’ the @entity78 is expected to back the change later this month			0
applications would then have to be approved by the @entity81 , but it is expected the first child could be born using the technique by the end of 2016			1
many mps – 81 @entity87 , 31 @entity88 and five @entity89 – had ethical and safety concerns , including justice secretary @entity91 who voted against the procedure			1
@entity95 mp @entity94 said the move was a ‘ red line mps should not cross ’ , adding : ‘ the implications simply can not be predicted , but one thing is for sure : once this alteration has taken place … there will be no going back			0
’ ' you 're quite sure you just want to buy the one @entity104 card ? ' @entity88 mp @entity105 said the technique had not been sufficiently tested and that families could suffer ‘ tragic outcomes ’			0
he said the @entity109 and @entity110 had banned similar techniques due to safety concerns			0
@entity95 sir @entity113 , a prominent @entity41 , asked : ‘ where do we stop ? ’ but @entity115 , chairman of the @entity116 , which held an inquiry into the procedure , said the fears were ‘ ill - founded ’			1
trials led scientists to ‘ conclude that the risks are small but worth taking because the benefits … are enormous ’ , he said			0
health minister @entity124 told @entity3 that the dna in mitochondria accounts for only 0.054 per cent of a person ’s overall dna and none of their characteristics			1
she added : ‘ not only would children born through such techniques be free of these conditions , but so would their children … breaking a chain of misery that would have ruined generations of lives			1
’ miss @entity124 assured @entity3 that the procedure would be subject to ‘ robust ’ regulation			0
last night @entity142 ’s professor @entity141 , who pioneered the procedure , said he was ‘ delighted ’			0
his patient @entity18 , 38 , from @entity145 , @entity146 , hopes to have the treatment			0
the management consultant ’s daughter , @entity20 , one , suffers from @entity113 syndrome , which means she is likely to die within a few years			0
‘ it would mean so much to us to be able to have a healthy child , ’ miss @entity18 said			0
‘ mitochondrial disease is unimaginably cruel			0
’ but the @entity40 argues it is ‘ irresponsible ’ to pursue the move before more research , and the @entity41 is opposed to artificial insemination			1
lawyer @entity158 , of @entity159 , said : ‘ the law needs to deal with expectations of the donor and recipients , and make clear their legal status to any resulting child			1
’ i look at my daughter and welcome this , by @entity169 given the immense medical and moral significance of the issue , it was curious that mps were given only 90 minutes to debate a law which would allow the creation of babies from two mothers and one father			1
for as public health minister @entity124 told the @entity116 , this is a bold step to take , involving world - beating science			0
but it is also one with deep global implications			0
despite alarmist opposition over ‘ three - parent children ’ , we already have more than two parents contributing biologically to the birth of children , with the use of egg donation and surrogacy @entity30 has become the first country in the world to endorse this extraordinary genetic innovation , developed largely at @entity142 , which involves mitochondrial replacement – healthy dna from one woman being inserted into embryos from another			1
this is particularly controversial since it means that genetic material will be carried by the newborn child and can be passed down future generations			1
not surprisingly , it has provoked fears that hidden side - effects could emerge in future years			0
but i strongly believe it was the right decision to take after an unusually exhaustive consultative process that does credit to our country , with three separate independent reviews over seven years			0
crucially , the process does not impinge on the very complex nuclear dna which contains the 23,000 genes that define the characteristics of a child			1
and despite alarmist opposition over ‘ three - parent children ’ , we already have more than two parents contributing biologically to the birth of children , with the use of egg donation and surrogacy			1
indeed , it could be argued that there are ‘ four ’ genetic parents involved when anyone is given an organ transplant – another modern medical intervention that highlights how science is constantly improving and extending the lives of human beings			1
prime minister @entity64 supported the move and said : ‘ as someone who has had the experience of having a severely disabled child [ @entity67 , who died six years ago ] i have every sympathy with those parents back in the 1970s , critics also opposed the introduction of in - vitro fertilisation , with similar emotive talk of doctors ‘ playing @entity75 ’ and potentially lethal consequences			2
but by the time the first ‘ test - tube baby ’ @entity251 turned 21 , such techniques had become routine , with 300,000 more people born by the process around the world			2
as the parent of a child born in the early 1990s with complex disabilities due to a rare genetic disorder , i can understand the pain of families forced to watch children suffer neurological conditions that could now be avoided			1
i still suffer agonies seeing my daughter scream as she suffers epileptic seizures , tears forming in her eyes as she thrashes around			0
although she is 21 and adorable , it still cuts to my core knowing she will never walk , talk or feed herself			0
some parents have seen a succession of children die in infancy or childhood due to faulty mitochondria – which can cause similar cases of complex epilepsy , as well as devastating conditions such as muscular dystrophy and even catastrophic organ failure			2
only one in 6,500 children develop these more serious disorders			0
now , if the change in regulation is approved by the @entity78 , such children will gain the chance to live a full life			0
yet while i welcome this advance , one critical mp yesterday asked where do we stop ? and he was right to pose this question , for there are moral questions that even this mild form of genetic engineering raises			2
some smug scientists now talk in excitable terms of eliminating all disabilities and , rather sinisterly , of ‘ enhancing evolution ’			0
this has been described as ‘ back - door eugenics ’ – the wiping out of certain types of people through medical advances			0
this would certainly be dangerous in a society that still excludes far too many people with disabilities from mainstream life and which aborts a rising number of children on grounds of an often comparatively minor disorder such as @entity316 ’s syndrome			2
so even as i praise yesterday ’s sensible decision , we still have to deal with the implications of this brave new world			0
however amazing these medical advances are , they also raise profound issues going to the heart of human existence			0
