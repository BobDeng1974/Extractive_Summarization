by @entity1 reporter an @entity3 scientist has discovered two new possible pyramid sites in @entity5 , after spending 10 years studying @entity6			1
archeology researcher @entity7 has pinpointed two areas along the @entity11 basin , 90 miles apart , both containing unusual shaped mounds			1
one site includes a 620ft - wide triangular plateau that 's almost three times the size of the @entity16 at @entity17			1
vast : the giant triangular plateau near @entity19 is three times the size of the great pyramid of @entity17 smaller mounds found by ms @entity7 still measure up to 330 feet across @entity7 's ' second site ' has four - sided ' pyramidal area ' , surrounded by further raised mounds ms @entity7 , who is based in @entity26 , now plans to visit the sites to confirm they really are the location of ancient pyramids			1
the first area sits alongside the @entity11 in @entity5 , 12 miles from the city of @entity33			0
if the plateau found there represents the remains of a genuine pyramid , it would be the largest ever discovered			0
the discovery was made by archeological researcher @entity7 , from @entity26 ms @entity7 said : ' upon closer examination of the formation , this mound appears to have a very flat top and a curiously symmetrical triangular shape that has been heavily eroded with time			1
' the second site , 90 miles north , contains a four - sided shape that 's 140ft wide			2
' it has a distinct square centre , which is very unusual for a mound of this size and it almost seems pyramidal when seen from above , ' ms @entity7 said			1
speaking to @entity52 , she added that there were also three smaller mounds : ' similar to the diagonal alignment of the @entity57 pyramids			0
' the images speak for themselves			2
it 's very obvious what the sites may contain , but field research is needed to verify they are , in fact , pyramids			0
' both sites are significant because almost all the known pyramids were built around @entity67			0
ms @entity7 's sites are much further south			1
it 's not the first archeological breakthrough to have been made thanks to @entity6 - in may last year @entity3 egyptologist dr @entity72 identified 17 lost pyramids			1
and ms @entity7 herself has used the program to discover a possible underwater city off the @entity77 in @entity78			1
pyramids were first built in @entity5 in the 28th century @entity80 as tombs for the nation 's @entity82			0
the most famous @entity85 pyramids are those found at @entity17 , on the outskirts of @entity67			1
vast and elaborate structures they took many years and up to 100,000 workers to construct			0
to date there are 138 known pyramids in @entity5			0
@entity93 - the first stone pyramid was built at @entity95 , just south of @entity17 , for the pharaoh djoser			1
unlike the later pyramids , it was made by building layers of stone on top of each other , so it resembled a set of steps			2
@entity106 of @entity17 was built as a tomb for the @entity108 ( @entity108 )			2
standing 147 metres hihg and weighing an estimated 6,500,000 tonnes , it 's the largest ever discovered			0
2575 - 2150bc - the golden age of pyramids			0
hundreds were constructed around @entity67			0
the new discovery is significant because almost all the 138 known pyramids are located near @entity67			0
ms @entity7 's pyramid sites are much further south			2
almost all the 138 known pyramids are located around @entity17 , in the outskirts of @entity67			2
ms @entity7 finds are far further south , near @entity119 and @entity120 square mound : a 150ft - wide truncated mound that ms @entity7 located near the ancient and abandoned town of @entity124 the @entity16 of @entity17 , centre , is the largest known pyramid and one of the seven wonders of the world			1

discovery made by @entity3 researcher @entity7 , who studied **satellite** images *5,000* away in @entity26
one site *spotted* on **satellite** is three times the size of @entity16 at @entity17
