by @entity0 last updated at 5:04 pm on 27th october 2011 retired headmaster @entity1 was told that he would have to wait a day and a half before his complaint about his bins not being collected would be heard all he wanted was for his rubbish to be taken away so when the binmen were four days late @entity1 decided to find out why			1

mr @entity1 , from @entity10 , said : ' i just want my rubbish collected			1
what is so difficult about emptying my bin ? he added : ' i rang @entity10 council after four days and i was told i was in a 37 - hour queue			1
