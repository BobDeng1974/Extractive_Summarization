one in 20 drivers have illegally paid someone to take penalty points for them , according to a new study			0
the research found six per cent have asked a friend or relative to take their points and a shocking five per cent confess to paying someone			1
but only half of those who have swapped points say they were caught ( 54 per cent ) and as a result 39 per cent of motorists are calling for point swapping drivers to face criminal prosecutions			2
former cabinet minister @entity19 and his ex-wife @entity20 each received eight month prison sentences two years ago for perverting the course of justice after they lied about swapping speeding points			1
data retrieved through a freedom of information request also showed a staggering 70,158 motorists are on the brink of being banned , holding nine points - just three from a potential ban			2
the @entity33 request revealed the lengths people go to avoid penalty points when caught speeding meanwhile , more than 6,800 motorists in the @entity37 have 12 points or more on their licence			1
extraordinarily , one @entity37 driver , who is still on the road , has a staggering 45 points , clocked up for nine speeding offences and 36 of failing to disclose the identity of the vehicle driver			1
the data was gathered by the car insurance comparison site @entity48 and showed the lengths people are willing to go to avoid a driving ban			0
of the motorists who admit swapping points , more than half have done so at least three times and more than one in seven think the penalty point system is not fit for purpose			1
the most common reason for swapping points with someone else is to keep their license clean , while a quarter of motorists admitted asking someone to take them because they were facing a driving ban			1
in total , 2,928,222 motorists currently have penalty points on their licence			0
the study found more than a third of us have received points for a motoring offence , with 80 per cent of these due to speeding			1
absurdly , more than one in 10 motorists ( 11 per cent ) even claimed they did n't know the practice of swapping penalty points is illegal			1
drivers are legally obliged to inform their insurers they have points on their licence , however more than one in six admit failing to do so			0
former cabinet minister @entity19 and his ex-wife @entity20 were jailed for lying about switching points many drivers said they would commit a crime by taking points for a family member			1
three quarters of drivers who said they would take someone else 's points ( 72 per cent ) said they would do so for their partner and a third said they would take points for their child , parent or sibling			0
more than a third of those who have taken points for someone else ( 37 per cent ) defended their decision to do so by saying the driver in question could have lost their job			2
the research also revealed some professions are more inclined to swap points than others			0
in total , 2,928,222 motorists have penalty points on their licence after falling foul of speed cameras motorists who work in the hospitality industry topped the list of professions trading points , followed by those who work in property and those who work in research			0
young drivers seem to be more likely to swap penalties , with 15 per cent of drivers aged 18 to 24 admitting to asking a friend or family member to take points , compared to just seven per cent of those aged 35 to 44			2
the driver with 45 points is still on the road as a result of a loophole in the system which states an @entity137 offence ( failing to disclose the identity of the vehicle driver ) is not something someone can be disqualified for			1
@entity142 , head of motor insurance at @entity48 said : ' it 's concerning to see that one in 20 motorists ( five per cent ) admit taking on a friend or relative 's penalty points			2
' avoiding penalty points for a motoring offence means many drivers who are prone to offences , such as speeding , remain on the roads , where they may pose a risk to others			0
' penalty points are designed to deter drivers from repeatedly breaking the law and to penalise those who do			0
' the police are aware there are drivers on the roads who are illegally swapping points , and motorists should remember the police have direct access to @entity170 data where they can look at anyone 's driving record to compare photos			2
' it can be easy for the police to match photos using @entity170 information , and to check whether the person taking points is the vehicle 's driver			0
' incurring multiple sets of penalty points can result in motoring fines , increased insurance premiums , and even disqualification from driving , so motorists should always drive safely and responsibly			0
