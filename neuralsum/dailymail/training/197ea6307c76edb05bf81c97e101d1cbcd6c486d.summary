a leading allergy doctor has debunked a host of myths , saying that gluten allergy does n’t exist – and nor do hypoallergenic pets			1
dr @entity5 , an allergy specialist from @entity7 , @entity8 , wrote a presentation debunking various common allergy misconceptions after years of hearing patients declare inaccuracies			1
one pet peeve is the patients who say they ca n’t eat bread because they ’re allergic to gluten , he says			2
all in the bread ? gluten allergy - which deters many people from eating bread - is not actually a real affliction , a doctor has said			1
while wheat is a recognised allergy , many people misinterpret that as gluten , ' he says ‘ there ’s this claim about “ gluten allergy , ” which really does n’t exist , ’ he told the website today.com			1
‘ it ’s not really a recognised allergy			2
@entity31 is a recognised allergy — but a lot of people will misinterpret that as gluten			1
wheat allergy does not necessarily equal an allergy to all gluten			1
he continued : ' gluten has been blamed for all that ails humanity			1
' in fact , there are only three disorders that can be scientifically attributed to gluten , he says : coeliac disease , wheat allergies and non-coeliac gluten sensitivity			2
coeliac disease is what 's known as an autoimmune condition			0
this is where the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue			0
patients with non-coeliac gluten sensitivity ( @entity58 ) display gluten sensitivity symptoms - such as bloating , diarrhoea and stomach pain - but test negative for the disease despite symptoms disappearing on a gluten - free diet			2
‘ if you think you may have an allergy , you should see a certified allergist for proper evaluation , testing , diagnosis and treatment , ’ dr @entity5 said			1
non-existent : hypoallergenic dogs , such as @entity76 , the @entity78 's dog , also do n't technically exist , says dr @entity5 also in the firing line are so - called hypoallergenic dogs			1
dr @entity5 said : ‘ unfortunately , there is no such thing as a truly hypoallergenic dog or cat			1
‘ allergens are released in saliva , sebaceous glands and perianal glands			1
it 's not the fur people are allergic to			1
' it is true that some breeds are more bothersome for allergy sufferers than others ’ – which is why some people are fine around some breeds and not others			2
dr @entity5 , whose work is being presented at the @entity99 of the @entity100 ( @entity100 ) , argues that some of these allergy myths can be damaging to health – especially if people wrongly cut out large food groups from their diet – or skip vaccinations			1
he said : ' many early medical beliefs have been proven to be incorrect as research has advanced			0
unfortunately , some of these beliefs are still on the @entity112 , where an astonishing 72 per cent of users turn to for health information			0
’ another widely circulated myth is that people suffering from an egg allergy ca n’t have such jabs – as they may include tiny bits of egg protein			0
he explained : ‘ @entity123 embryos are used to grow viruses for vaccines such as the flu , yellow fever and rabies shots			0
’ ‘ however , it 's now safe to get the flu shot , which can help prevent serious illness , but a referral to an allergist is recommended beforehand is recommended			0
’ he also advises against home allergy tests , which can be unreliable			0
‘ these tests might be able to reveal sensitisation , but being sensitized to a certain allergen , like milk , does n't mean you 're allergic			2
‘ these sort of at - home screening tests are not reliable and can often lead to misinterpretation , diagnostic confusion and unnecessary dietary elimination			0
‘ coeliac disease is a common digestive condition where a person has an adverse reaction to gluten - a protein found in wheat , barley and rye			1
eating foods containing gluten can trigger a range of symptoms , such as : diarrhoea , bloating , weight loss and extreme tiredness			0
contrary to popular belief , coeliac disease is n't an allergy or an intolerance to gluten			2
it is in fact what 's known as an autoimmune condition			0
this is where the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue			0
in cases of coeliac disease , the immune system mistakes substances found inside gluten as a threat to the body and attacks them			0
this damages the surface of the small bowel ( intestines ) , disrupting the body ’s ability to absorb nutrients from food			0
