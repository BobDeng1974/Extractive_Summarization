@entity2 , under the management of @entity1 , became the team everyone hated and everyone hated to play against			1
but if there is something worse than being hated , it is being ignored and that is where we are with @entity12 ’ @entity2 side now			1
while the physical nature of the team @entity15 built brought incendiary headlines , critical comment and damning statistics – i was the captain of his team in the @entity22 from 2004 - 2007 – the progress made by @entity12 has been overlooked			1
@entity2 stars @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 celebrate during the @entity29 ' 2 - 0 win over @entity30 in the @entity31 on wednesday which lifted them to eighth in the table @entity2 have collected 23 points from a possible 33 since @entity34			1
only @entity35 and @entity36 have picked up more , so why is n’t there more attention to their achievements ? when @entity2 beat @entity30 this week to rise to eighth place in the @entity31 , the aftermath was n’t about how well @entity2 are doing but instead about the struggling @entity42 and @entity30			1
@entity2 are the team who are above @entity45 ’s @entity44 – recently championed after their defeat of @entity47 – @entity48 , @entity49 and the rest of the bottom ten			1
@entity52 have exceeded everyone ’s expectations this season and receive weekly reviews as the nation ’s romance story ; neutrals want them to do well , to upset the normal order of the top four			2
but what is it about @entity2 , who are as high as they can probably ever wish to be , that generates such little media attention or positive write ups ? @entity2 , as a city , finds itself situated between the bigger and more glamorous cities of @entity71 and @entity72 , but it has a lot to offer			1
@entity2 's @entity75 tracks @entity77 striker @entity76 during a championship match at the @entity79 in november 2004 , which was the defender 's first season at the club @entity84 striker @entity83 tries to take evasive action as @entity75 jumps across to make a tackle during @entity2 's 3 - 1 home defeat by the @entity84 in march 2006 @entity75 stands all smiles at the @entity79 during his time as a @entity2 player			1
it was a period in the defender 's career where he admits he felt wanted by the club in his three - year spell which ended in 2007 when i moved to @entity2 from @entity98 , the city did n’t have a @entity99 or some of the swanky restaurants i left in @entity98 , but it did n’t matter			1
the club gave me a home and a place			0
i felt wanted - i did n’t want anything else			0
i moved near the training ground in nearby @entity105 and was very happy			0
i had @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 was on my doorstep too			0
back when i was a @entity2 player the club always seemed to have a power struggle going on upstairs			2
there was a lack of a clear vision as to who was in charge and the direction in which they wanted to take the club			0
then @entity119 took over in 2006 and the vision became clear			0
a @entity2 boy and self - made millionaire , mr @entity119 has the club at heart and never hides that love			2
he has made some wise appointments to manage the football team			0
@entity2 were promoted to the @entity31 under the management of @entity1 , with @entity75 playing under the now @entity128 boss while at the @entity29 in the championship @entity1 arranges a training drill at @entity2 's training ground in 2012			1
@entity75 described the sessions as regimented and boring , but admits it made the team play better on match days since @entity12 has taken over , the club have only spent £ 10m in the transfer market , which is a tremendous job in the current climate of spending			1
@entity2 have become quite successful in finding players to fit the mold , with @entity12 and his staff working with head of recruitment @entity145			1
they do n’t overspend and yet they have created and established a @entity31 team			0
finishing 12th,11th , 14th and 13th twice since coming into the @entity31 , last season was their highest - ever			0
with a 9th place finish			0
but now they are one place higher and playing a more attractive passing style			2
during my first spell under @entity1 , we were very direct , often going back to front in less than two passes			2
training was regimented , often just walking through team shape and then doing set pieces			0
i did n’t like it and found it boring but it made us better on match days and i loved the feeling of a clean sheet			0
@entity2 attracted criticism for their direct style of play after being promoted to the @entity31 in 2008 , with teams forced into having to form defensive tactics against long @entity171 throw ins @entity12 gives advice to @entity2 's @entity173 during a league game against @entity35 , and @entity75 claims the @entity29 have improved their style of play having spent little money under the @entity178 the next season under @entity181 , everything was totally different			1
the @entity183 manager had a pure footballing philosophy and every training session was 100 per cent football			0
i loved everything from the training , to the games and to the way he spoke football when @entity1 came back the following season , it reverted back to the old regime of pattern of play and set pieces in training			1
it was very frustrating it ’s a different club now with a different manager and a different footballing ethos			0
you never see @entity12 in the technical area signaling to his players to pass from back to front , but instead he is gesturing to pass the ball and it looks as if the players are enjoying the experience			2
i believe they deserve more credit and exposure			2
but if that does n’t happen , then i ’m sure the loud choruses of ‘ delilah ’ from the fans will drown out any negative , stereotypical opinions outside .			0

@entity2 were hated by everyone under management of @entity1
but despite improving style under @entity12 they have become ignored
only @entity35 and @entity36 have picked up more points since @entity34
*potters* deserve more credit for improving *results* and style of play
