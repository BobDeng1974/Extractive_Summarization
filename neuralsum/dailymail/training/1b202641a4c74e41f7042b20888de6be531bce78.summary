by @entity0 published : 08:28 est , 22 april 2012 updated : 01:49 est , 23 april 2012 health secretary @entity1 risks igniting another row in the sector after documents revealed he is backing plans to pay less to @entity7 workers in poorer parts of the country @entity1 is risking a new row with the unions after supporting lower pay for thousands of @entity7 staff who live in poorer parts of the country			1
the health secretary wants nurses , midwives , porters , cleaners and paramedics to receive different pay packets dependent on where they live			0
more expensive house prices and other factors would mean @entity7 staff would be paid more in the south east than in the north and the midlands			0
official documents prepared by the @entity30 show that the only exemptions would be managers working in new bodies established to deliver mr @entity1 ’s reform programme			2
chancellor @entity35 raised the issue of regional pay bargaining before the @entity38 , but senior @entity39 opposed it			2
mr @entity1 ’s submission to the @entity7 pay review body called for a national basic pay rate at a ‘ minimum level necessary ’ , and forsupplements in particular regions			2
this would help the private sector in depressed areas compete for workers with the public sector			1
‘ current rates of pay in the @entity7 do vary geographically , but significantly less so than the pay of comparable staff in the private sector , ’ the submission says			1
‘ the introduction of more sensitive market - facing pay would therefore enable more efficient and effective use of @entity7 funds			0
nurses , midwives , hospital porters , cleaners and paramedics would receive a lower paycheck under the proposals if they work in the @entity67 or the north , compared with their counterparts in southern counties ‘ while the @entity7 pay premium is relatively high , there is the potential for private sector enterprise to be crowded out with adverse impact on the prospects for local economic growth			1
’ but senior @entity39 backbencher @entity85 said : ‘ not content with cementing the divisions between the north and south , @entity1 ’s proposals harden the divisions between the well - paid and the rest			2
this demonstrates his continuing , unfortunate talent for alienating the people he needs to rely on most : @entity7 staff			0
‘ regional pay proposals and the blinkered ideology that underpins it remains a red line for many @entity92 and risk provoking an enduring , embittering standoff within the coalition which will profit no one			1
’ @entity39 mp @entity85 ( pictured ) , co-chair of the party 's parliamentary policy committee on health and social care , said the plans will further widen the divide between north and south , well - paid and the rest and @entity104 , head of health at @entity105 , the largest health union , said : ‘ for a government that says it wants to cut paperwork , introducing regional pay would be a massively expensive , bureaucratic nightmare , designed to cause huge disruption and conflict			0
’ commenting on the proposals , the @entity30 said : ' our evidence shows how more market - facing pay could help employers make better use of the @entity7 pay bill			0
' it makes clear that there is a compelling case for implementing market facing pay for all @entity125 and @entity126 staff in @entity127 , whether they fulfil a support role , work in admin or work on the front line , such as nurses and other clinical staff			1
' the principle of equal pay applies to all staff across the entire country			0

front line staff would be affected in @entity1 's pay proposals
changes follow chancellor 's call for wages in line with private sector
