an honest assistant manager of a @entity1 found an abandoned backpack stuffed with cash while cleaning tables late last month and rather than keep it , notified her manager			1
@entity7 waited for the bag 's owner to come back to the @entity11 , @entity12 , outlet of the fast food chain and claim it			1
strangely no - one did , so she took it to franchise owner @entity16 who opened the bag to look for @entity18			1
the contents of the bag surprised them both : $ 100,000 in cash along with a baggie of marijuana and a suspicious ' white rock '			1
’ said @entity16 : ' i open the zipper , i see lots of money , cash money , $ 100 bills stack up like half the bag			1
i said , " wow ! today 's my birthday , this is my birthday gift			0
' he immediately called the police			0
‘ i 've been in this country 26 years and i worked two jobs for 15 years before i bought this @entity1			0
so i 'm a very hard working man			0
i do n't want that money , maybe it belongs to somebody			0
’ when police inspected the backpack , they found ten stacks of $ 10,000 totaling $ 100,000 , candy , cigarettes , a bank withdrawal slip , and a bag of marijuana and a ' white rock ' in it , that possibly could have been drugs , @entity16 told @entity65			1
the restaurant was busy that afternoon and @entity11 police sergeant @entity67 said there were not many leads related to the owner 's identity			1
police were working with local bank officials to locate the individual who left the money behind			2
for now the cash has been booked into a property warehouse			2
stacks of bills totaling $ 100,000 was found along with a small amount of marijuana and a deposit slip officers told @entity16 that by law the money was his if nobody claimed it in a six - month period			1
given the amount of cash , there is speculation it was intended for a morally dubious transaction and may therefore go unclaimed			0
if the money does come to him , @entity16 told @entity93 that he would ‘ donate the money to needy people ’			0
speaking to the @entity95 , he said one possibility was a @entity98 foundation that he allows to leave fundraising material on his counter			2
@entity16 is a muslim himself , and originally came to the @entity102 from @entity103			0
only two weeks earlier , the branch had mistakenly accepted counterfeit $ 100 bills , and @entity16 put up a handwritten sign on the milk shake machine by the cash register saying no $ 100 bills please			0
asked if anyone has ever left a large amount of cash behind before , @entity16 recalled : ‘ one time a lady left her wallet with $ 800 in it			0
’ on that occasion he found her atm card , called the bank , and she got her money back			2
the @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity1 restaurant where $ 100k in cash was found in a backpack along with marijuana , candy , lists of phone numbers and email addresses , a bank withdrawal slip and an atm card			1
