by @entity0 published : 17:35 est , 5 june 2013 updated : 11:42 est , 11 june 2013 @entity1 has long been making fashionistas sick			1
who could fail to be envious of her jet - set lifestyle , her beautiful family or her burgeoning fashion empire ? but the newly discovered medical condition @entity8 is not a malady caused by excessive jealousy but the name experts have given to a real physical problem — muscle strain caused by carrying heavy bags			1
experts are blaming the a-list ’s favoured ' @entity16 ' ( @entity16 ) — the trend for carrying an oversized weighty handbag on a bent elbow — for a rise in the number of women suffering shoulder problems , torn muscles and inflamed tendons			1
@entity27 is best : @entity1 photographed out and about with her gargantuan white @entity29 bag and i ’m ashamed to say , i ’m one of them			1
earlier this year , i purchased a gorgeous new designer bag			1
although it was , in the words of @entity36 , ' reassuringly expensive ' , it was n’t the price tag that left me wincing			1
made by luxury @entity41 fashion house @entity39 , my new tote is heavy duty leather and full of useful pockets that fasten with several chunky zips			1
it ’s got extra flaps and reinforced straps and metal studs on the bottom so it does n’t get ruined if you put it down on the floor ( but as it cost more than my first car , this is something i never do )			2
despite it ’s equally hefty price tag , the handle is too small to fit over my shoulder , so , of course , i do the whole ‘ arm hook crook ’ thing			2
yet since i bought my @entity39 bag , i ’ve had a relapse of an earlier jumbo handbag - related ailment — sporadic but severe bouts of shoulder pain that radiate down into the pectoral muscle on my chest			2
it ’s unsurprising then , that oversized totes are not only loved by the style set but by osteopaths , chiropractors and physiotherapists , too , as handbag - related injuries are boosting their bank balances			1
i first felt my ' handbag injury ' almost four years ago when i noticed a sharp pain in my right shoulder			2
but because i ’d had a car accident a few years earlier that left me with a cracked sternum and damaged muscles in my upper back and around my collarbone , i put it down to a flare - up of that			1
love : @entity88 is famous for her passion for big bags , although it 's one the fashion world shares ouch : sadly for big bag fans , carrying them around can lead to painful injuries to the arms and shoulders then , after a few weeks of nagging twinges , i went to see a physiotherapist who , after taking one look at my overloaded @entity103 bag , promptly sent me to fashion purgatory by telling me to go home via @entity106 and invest in a @entity108 backpack			2
' the kind worn by hikers ' he said			2
' make sure you get one with padded straps and wear it on both shoulders			2
' i did n’t , nay , could n’t ! but i found the bag ’s abandoned shoulder strap from the depths of my wardrobe and stopped carrying the equivalent of four bricks in it			2
briefly , my symptoms abated			0
several years later , fashion ’s love affair with the large handbag is not only going strong , it ’s got stronger			1
@entity29 bags are more popular than ever , @entity103 ’s new @entity127 is rather substantial			0
then there ’s @entity131 ’s latest number , the 31 hour leather tote and @entity134 ’s heroine handbag			0
my @entity39 model is called the ' luggage '			0
it ’s a fitting moniker for something that currently houses my @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , complete make - up bag , pair of flat shoes , a diary , a note book , my keys , two pens , a bottle of water , several hairbands and various assorted lip balms			0
' we have seen a huge increase in women with shoulder and neck problems caused by handbags , ' said physiotherapist @entity160 , who also says some patients are lugging around bags weighing one - and - a - half stone			1
' women may think they are following a catwalk trend , but they are storing up trouble			0
' perhaps so , but when it comes to bags , women know that size does matter			0
celebrities may favour large bags to make them look smaller , but most women simply carry them out of necessity			1
it ’s that , or a small bag accompanied by two linen shopping bags full of everything a modern girl needs , swinging from your shoulders			0
bags of damage : if women like @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192 copy @entity1 and carry their bags in the crook of their elbow , they could face torn muscles and inflamed shoulder tendons model approval : exclusive gym @entity199 trains @entity201 ( left ) and @entity202 ( right ) having flirted with a mini @entity103 shoulder bag throughout winter ( it could barely fit my purse and a lipstick , meaning keys were left languishing precariously in my pocket ) and an envelope - style snakeskin clutch bag throughout spring ( it gave me hand cramp and i eventually left it under a chair ) there was no option but to big - up my bag again			1
this is not something @entity220 , performance specialist at @entity222 ’s exclusive @entity199 ( the gym beloved by celebrities such as @entity201 and @entity202 ) approves of			0
' carrying a heavy bag has many postural affects on the body , ' says @entity220			0
' it not only pulls down the shoulder , which can put constant strain on the neck muscles , but our bodies naturally lean away from the side on which we ’re holding a weight — in this case a bag			1
' this leaning leads to a tightening of the opposite side of the neck , as well as throwing your shoulders , hips , knees and ankles out of alignment			0
' do n’t even get me started on high heels , ' he adds			0
i dare n’t tell @entity220 what i am wearing today			0
but if i had to make a choice between the two fashion evils , i know which i ’d choose			0
and let ’s just say i wo n’t be hotfooting it to @entity106 anytime soon .			0
