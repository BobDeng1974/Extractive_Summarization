when a pole dancing society opened at a university , dozens of women signed up to get fit			1
but the club has now been disbanded after @entity6 ’s students ’ union objected because of the pastime ’s links to the sex industry			1
in a statement , it said : ‘ activities such as pole fitness contributes to an atmosphere where women are viewed as sexual objects and where violence against them is acceptable			2
‘ evidence shows that young women aged 16 to 24 are the group who experience the most domestic and sexual violence			2
the @entity23 was initially allowed to become an official society of the union , but the decision was later revoked ' this is the age of a large group of our female students			0
this activity is inextricably linked to the multi-million - pound sex industry and upholds and bolsters sexist attitudes and behaviours			1
’ the @entity23 was due to hold twice - weekly sessions before the union intervened			0
@entity38 president @entity37 said : ‘ lap dancing occurs in gentlemen ’s clubs			0
pole fitness is strictly for fitness			0
since the classes are purely for fitness , there is therefore no link between it and the sex industry			1
’ @entity50 , its treasurer , added : ‘ there are union societies that encourage binge drinking and have done naked calendars			0
‘ but a fitness class which encourages a healthy lifestyle , body confidence and self - esteem does n’t fit into these policies			2

keep - fit classes were a big hit with the women at @entity6
@entity67 *chiefs* said pole dancing ' inextricably linked to sex industry '
society president said it was ' *highly* *offensive* ' to suggest class was sexual
