by @entity0 published : 17:17 est , 5 june 2013 updated : 17:25 est , 5 june 2013 confirmation that i had begun what we used to know as ' the change of life ' came as no shock to me whatsoever			1
actually , it was a huge relief			1
i was in my mid- 40s and had been experiencing the usual symptoms : unpredictable periods , feeling a bit low , and the occasional hot flush and night sweat			1
my wonderful gp did a blood test , confirmed my suspicions , asked whether i wanted @entity18 ( @entity18 ) pills or patches			1
my childbearing days were over			1
the menopause years have been ' the most rewarding of my life ' believe it or not , i welcomed it			1
with two sons then in their teens , i had no desire for more children			1
having spent half my life trying to control my fertility - first to avoid being an unmarried mother , then to prevent expansion of my family which i saw as large enough - the menopause was , frankly , very welcome			1
and while some women regard ageing and the loss of their fertility as depressing , i have never been one to fuss about growing older and , hopefully , wiser			1
that is why i read reports last week from the biologist dr @entity43 - arguing that the menopause may soon become a thing of the past , with women ' evolving ' out of it - with absolute horror			1
dr @entity43 says the menopause dates from a time when generations of women were competing over scarce resources , and it was not ideal for them all to bear children at the same time			1
now , in an age when resources are plentiful , life expectancies are longer and women remain healthier at a greater age , she says the menopause is not necessary and women could soon bear children in their 50s and beyond			1
@entity63 greeted the news that women may soon ' evolve ' out of menopause with ' absolute horror ' @entity68 forbid			1
while medical science and the cosmetics industry constantly chase the dream of eternal youth , please could our fertility cycle be left to run its natural course ? menopause is a natural rite of passage , as rich as any other in a woman 's life			1
a good thing , not to be dreaded or avoided , but to be met with courage and a sense of adventure			1
this is that moment when you realise you no longer have to worry about getting pregnant or nurturing needy small children ; that you have moved into a freer stage of life where your time is more often your own			1
and believe me , that moment is truly liberating			2
some of the most beautiful and effective women i know are in their 60s , 70s or even their 80s			2
@entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 to name but three			2
i was deeply touched when i once asked the politician and academic @entity100 about the anxiety so many women feel about losing their fertility as they grow older			2
she said : ' getting older in public life is so secondary			2
if you see yourself only as a sexual , reproductive being , i 'm sure it 's hard if that part of life is behind you			2
but for me , even as a mother , it was only one part			2
i 've always been valued , and valued myself , for other things			2
' her wisdom is a lesson to us all , and one i have tried wholeheartedly to embrace			2
we should not be ashamed of growing old : we should embrace our wrinkles and be engaged with and admired for everything we 've learned in our lives			2
as soon as i had my diagnosis , i took my doctors ' advice and popped the @entity18 pills			2
my mother had a terrible time at around the same age and had taken @entity18 for 20 years with heartening results , so i followed her lead			2
i was told it would help sustain my energy and assist in stemming the loss of collagen in my skin			2
this way , my face would remain fresh , my hair thick and glossy , and i would not be plagued by hot flushes during a broadcast			0
the different ways in which women react to the menopause is a subject i am deeply interested in , and prompted me to write my book , @entity146 ? - a modern woman 's guide to @entity149 , ten years ago			1
' menopause is a natural rite of passage , as rich as any other in a woman 's life			1
a good thing , not to be dreaded or avoided , but to be met with courage and a sense of adventure			1
' in the introduction i pointed out how , given today 's life spans , many women will be post-menopausal for a third of their lives			0
as we bring up our children so much later , we have to deal with that explosive hormonal cocktail ; the menopausal woman and the teenage son or daughter			0
we also have to decide whether we want to go along with science that keeps us young , either through pills or the surgeon 's knife			0
we can grow old disgracefully with hair dye as our constant companion , or be graceful and grey in the distinguished manner once only available to men			0
for some of the women i spoke to during my research , the menopause was a distressing time			1
hot flushes and heavy periods are hardly pleasant experiences			0
but it rarely lasts long and there 's no evidence to say the menopause has a damaging effect on a woman 's brainpower			1
i remember the actress @entity193 appearing on a television show to discuss her role as the dance teacher in the film of @entity198			0
@entity193 and i are the same age , 63 , and it was so refreshing to hear her laugh about her hot flushes during the dance routines			0
by this time i was on @entity18 , which stopped the flushes and night sweats			0
but after ten years of taking it , i developed breast cancer - something i firmly believe would not have happened had i let the menopause pass naturally			1
@entity213 ? ' fans , darling , fans , ' @entity211 once said			0
' always carry an elegant one			0
' if i had my time again , i would embrace the changes and welcome the freedom heralded by the absence of periods			0
i 'd do my best to protect my heart with regular exercise and not smoking			0
and i 'd take the advice given to the former newsreader , @entity224 , by @entity211 , one of the television stars of the @entity226 and @entity227			0
when asked if she had ever taken @entity18 , @entity211 replied : ' no , darling			0
fans , darling , fans			0
always carry an elegant one			0
' i 've now been post-menopausal for nearly 20 years and i can truly say they 've been the most rewarding of my life			0
i 've seen my boys grow into smashing young men , accompanied my parents through the ends of their lives , dealt with a life - threatening disease and loved every minute of working harder than ever and having more time to spend with friends			0
another argument @entity43 used to bolster her theory that the menopause was obsolete in the modern world was the ' grandmother hypothesis '			1
hormone replacement therapy tablets : many experiencing menopause use them to ease the effects of menopause this makes the assumption that the menopause evolved in tribal cultures , because it creates a generation of child - free older women who can help the fertile childbearers look after the families : the maternal grandmother becomes the key person responsible for raising , but not bearing , children			1
but in the @entity263 , dr @entity43 argues , that system no longer prevails			0
instead , older women are increasingly healthy and able to raise their own young families			0
however , the idea that the role of grandparents is now obsolete simply is n't borne out by evidence			0
did n't research published last week by @entity271 and @entity272 reveal that the nation 's grandparents save families Â£ 7.3 billion a year by taking on childcare for their working sons and daughters ? the older generation cares for 1.6 million children , and the hours they put in have risen to 1.7 billion - a 35 per cent rise since 2004			0
so it seems the ' grandmother hypothesis ' is actually a perfect fit for @entity286 economies , where both parents often need to work but ca n't afford paid childcare			0
post-menopausal women have a vital place in the world and should feel no need to compete with young women of childbearing age			0
i hope dr @entity43 's vision is wrong			0
a world where the menopause has died out to allow more babies to be born to women aged 50 - plus is not one i 'd ever welcome			1
evolution should stand still on that score and the menopause should stay as it is - a valuable midlife experience beyond which women can enjoy new freedoms .			1

@entity0 greeted the onset of menopause with huge relief
the radio broadcaster believes it should not be dreaded or avoided
