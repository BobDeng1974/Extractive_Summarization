by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 02:50 est , 11 september 2013 updated : 06:43 est , 11 september 2013 swipe : business secretary @entity2 is striking a more downbeat tone than the chancellor @entity2 is to rebuke @entity5 for ‘ complacency ’ over @entity8 's economic recovery			1
amid renewed tensions between the two men , the business secretary warned the chancellor that ministers ‘ ca n't rest on our laurels ’			1
mr @entity2 struck a distinctly gloomy tone in contrast to mr @entity5 ’s assertion this week that the economy was finally ‘ turning a corner ’			1
@entity21 mr @entity2 will use a speech tonight to say that ‘ a few quarters of good economic data ’ did not mean the country was out of the woods			1
instead he argues that while there are the ‘ beginnings of a recovery story ’ , it would not become ‘ meaningful ’ until there was strong and sustained business investment , which remained well down on pre-crash levels			2
there also appears to be a @entity35 split over efforts to revive the hosuing market			0
mr @entity5 has also called for more 95 per cent loan - to - value mortgages which he insisted were not ‘ weapons of financial mass destruction ’ but mr @entity2 warned of the risks of the housing market ‘ getting out of control ’			1
in his address to a joint @entity48 / @entity47 industrial strategy conference at @entity49 , the business secretary will say that while there were ‘ encouraging ’ signs for the economy , there was still further to go			1
‘ we ca n't rest on our laurels			2
the kind of growth we want wo n't simply emerge of its own volition			0
in fact , i see a number of dangers			0
one is complacency , generated by a few quarters of good economic data , ’ he will say			2
‘ it is n't difficult to see evidence of confidence returning , and there are positive trends in production			0
taken together with success stories like the car industry and export growth in emerging markets , we have the beginnings of a recovery story			0
‘ but there are risks , not least the housing market getting out of control			0
recovery will not be meaningful until we see strong and sustained business investment - and this is still 13 % down on its 2008 peak and , as a share of @entity86 , is currently the lowest in the @entity87			2
’ upbeat : @entity5 used a speech this week to declare that the @entity8 economy is ' turning a corner ' mr @entity2 will stress that the improving economic news did not mean that the need for long - term re-structuring and re-balancing could be forgotten			1
‘ if we are to turn the @entity8 economy around on a sustainable basis there will have to be relatively rapid growth of exports and import substitutes , ’ he will say			2
it is a markedly different tone to mr @entity5 , who yesterday ridiculed @entity103 opponent @entity102 for refusing to admit defeat on the big economic arguments			1
shadow chancellor @entity102 has accused mr @entity5 of choking off the economic recovery mr @entity102 was likened to @entity108 ’s @entity107 who brushes off losing both arms as ‘ just a flesh wound ’			1
mr @entity5 said : ‘ he is increasingly like @entity108 ’s @entity107 defending that bridge			1
‘ when unemployment falls he says it ’s but a scratch , when business confidence rises he says i ’ve had worse , the recovery is just a flesh wound			2
‘ the limbs are falling off his economic argument and it would be a comedy if it were not for the fact @entity103 ’s economic policies were a tragedy			0
’ the government has been bolstered by a run of positive data which suggests the economy is on course for a sustained recovery in the run - up to the next election			0
the respected @entity135 think tank last week upgraded its growth forecast			0
it now expects the @entity8 economy to expand by 1.5 per cent in 2013 , up from its prediction of 0.8 per cent issued in may			0
but @entity103 ’s shadow business secretary @entity141 said mr @entity2 had delivered an ‘ embarrassing slap - down ’ to mr @entity5			1
however , he insisted that the @entity21 could not distance themselves from the chancellor 's economic strategy			1
‘ it also reminds everyone that you ca n't trust a word the @entity21 say			0
@entity2 has supported the chancellor 's policies which choked off the recovery in 2010 , ’ he said			0
‘ three wasted years of flatlining that has left families worse off and done long term damage to our economy is his record and he should take responsibility for it			0
