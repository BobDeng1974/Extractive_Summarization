by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 11:29 est , 31 october 2013 updated : 12:46 est , 31 october 2013 @entity4 members yesterday called on the @entity5 to use its authority to force the @entity8 football team to change its controversial name			1
representatives from the @entity11 met in @entity12 on wednesday with the @entity5 and @entity8 officials			1
but , seemingly like their counterparts in @entity17 's @entity16 , the three parties could not come to any agreement on the issue of the football team 's name			1
the @entity11 claim there should be an @entity5 bylaw prohibiting any term using a racial epithet			0
@entity24 said the dictionary defines the word " redskins " precisely like that the roadblock is caused by @entity8 ' owner @entity36 's refusal to change the name , @entity11 's refusal to back down from their claim the name is offensive , and the @entity5 's apparent refusal to take a stand on the issue			1
' we requested that the commissioner use his authority to refer @entity36 to the league for possible sanction over the continued use of the term , ' said @entity11 representative @entity24 , referring to the @entity8 owner , according to @entity54			1
' if the commissioner lacks the power to act , he should publicly say so			0
' ' despite ridiculous assertions to the contrary , the use of the r - word is not a unifying force nor does it convey respect			0
it is the very word our people heard when they were dragged by gunpoint off their land and dragged onto reservations , ' @entity24 said			2
who moves next ? @entity8 quarterback @entity69 in action for his team			2
@entity8 owner @entity36 said the controversial name will stay the @entity5 said the meeting was part of an ' on - going dialogue ' on the issue			1
' we listened and respectfully discussed the views of mr. @entity24 , @entity80 and their colleagues as well as the sharply differing views of many other @entity83 and fans in general , ' a statement from the @entity5 said			2
' the meeting was part of an ongoing dialogue to facilitate listening and learning , consistent with the commissioner 's comments earlier this year			2
' @entity11 representatives called on @entity5 commissioner @entity90 , pictured here , to use his ' authority ' to force the @entity8 to change its name			1
@entity90 met with franchise owner @entity36 on tuesday but reportedly discussed tactics on how to handle the issue not a decision @entity8 owner @entity36 met with @entity5 commissioner @entity90 on tuesday but did not discuss plans to change the name , according to reports of the meeting			1
@entity36 remains firm that the name will not be changed , recently writing a letter to team fans that claimed the name ' was , and continues to be , a badge of honor			0
' ' i â€™ve listened carefully to the commentary and perspectives on all sides , and i respect the feelings of those who are offended by the team name , ' @entity36 wrote			0
' but i hope such individuals also try to respect what the name means , not only for all of us in the extended @entity8 family , but among @entity83 too			2
' @entity11 representatives called for @entity90 , @entity36 , and other top @entity5 executives to again meet during the week of the @entity120 in 2014 and to visit @entity83 reservations to see first - hand how the term ' @entity8 ' affects @entity11 members			1
' we will not be silent on this issue and it 's not going to go away , not this time , ' @entity24 said			0
' this strikes at the heart of the issue of what kind of future our children will have			0
' @entity8 owner @entity36 , pictured , claims he has no plans to change the @entity8 name			1
the team was founded as the @entity138 in 1932 before renaming in 1933 after a name clash with a baseball team with the same name			2
the team moved to @entity17 , in 1937 the controversy has spread to how some media organizations now refer to the @entity5 team			2
the @entity146 is the latest in a growing list of publications to stop using the term ' @entity8 ' when it refers to @entity17 's @entity5 team			1
managing editor @entity151 announced on wednesday that the newspaper 's style council decided to eliminate the term because of a long - standing policy against using racial slurs			0
the use of the @entity8 name is being contested in the @entity157 in an attempt to block its use			0
@entity160 , an @entity83 rights activist , said claims the @entity8 name was part of the team 's heritage was flawed			1
' part of that heritage and tradition is name - calling , belittling and maligning native peoples , ' @entity160 said			0
' the n - word was traditional and had quite a heritage , too			0
happily , not all traditions are carried on forever			0
' the @entity8 were known as the @entity138 in 1932 , their inaugural year			1
they played in @entity173 in @entity174 , also home at the time to baseball teams the @entity138 ( now the @entity138 ) and current @entity178 champions , the @entity179			0
