by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 06:55 est , 8 november 2013 updated : 08:26 est , 8 november 2013 ' poisoned ' : @entity4 a chief @entity3 investigator says @entity7 is the ' only suspect ' @entity7 is the only suspect in the 2004 death of @entity4 , the chief @entity3 investigator in the case says			1
he was speaking a day after @entity13 scientists said the @entity3 leader was probably poisoned by radioactive polonium			0
the investigator , @entity16 , spoke at a news conference held by the @entity3 team that has been investigating @entity4 's death			1
mr @entity16 said that @entity4 did not die a natural death , but was evasive when asked repeatedly whether he believed @entity4 was poisoned by polonium			1
' it is not important that i say here that he was killed by polonium , ' said mr @entity16 , who heads the @entity3 committee investigating @entity4 's mysterious death			1
' but i say , with all the details available about @entity4 's death , that he was killed , and that @entity7 killed him			1
' at another point , he described @entity7 as the ' first , fundamental and only suspect in the assassination of @entity4			0
' @entity7 has denied any role in @entity4 's death , saying it had politically isolated him at the time and had no reason to assassinate him			1
' let me state this as simply as i can : @entity7 did not kill @entity4 , ' @entity7 @entity40 spokesman @entity38 said on friday , in response to the latest allegations			2
' the @entity3 should stop this nonsense and stop raising these baseless accusations without any shadow of proof , ' mr @entity43 added			0
mr @entity4 's widow , @entity48 , has called on the @entity3 leadership to seek justice for her husband , saying : ' it 's clear this is a crime			1
' she did not mention @entity7 but argued that only countries with nuclear capabilities had access to polonium			0
in another interview she described her husband 's death as a ' political assassination ' and ' the crime of the century ' and called the new testing conclusive for poisoning			2
she said she could not predict who was behind the death , but added : ' whoever did this crime is a coward			0
' justice : mr @entity4 's widow , @entity48 , has called on the @entity3 leadership to seek justice for her husband @entity4 died on november 11 , 2004 at a @entity75 military hospital , at the age of 75 , a month after falling ill at his @entity78 compound			1
at the time , @entity75 doctors said he died of a stroke and had a blood - clotting problem , but records were inconclusive about what caused that condition			0
@entity4 's grave was opened earlier this year , enabling @entity13 , @entity87 and @entity75 scientists to take bone and soil samples for separate investigations			2
a @entity13 team presented its findings on thursday , saying it found abnormal levels of polonium - 210 and lead in @entity4 's remains that could not have occurred naturally and that the results " reasonably " support the theory that @entity4 was poisoned by polonium			2
they said the timeframe of @entity4 's illness and death was consistent with poisoning from ingesting polonium			2
the substance is rare and lethal even in minuscule amounts , and nine years on , it would be difficult to track down anyone who might have slipped it into @entity4 's food or drink			0
the @entity3 themselves could come under renewed scrutiny , since @entity4 was holed up in his @entity7 - besieged @entity78 compound in the months before his death , surrounded by advisers , staff and bodyguards			1
@entity87 findings were summarized on friday by a member of the @entity3 team , dr @entity121			0
he said the @entity87 team also found that @entity4 died as a result of a toxic substance , but did not find sufficient evidence to point to polonium as the " cause of radiation that led to the death			0
