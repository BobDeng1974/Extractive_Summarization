as blood passes through a person 's body , the skin changes colour ever so slightly and the new @entity13 camera can recognise these changes to establish how fast the blood is pumping			1
by knowing the speed of the blood , the camera can then determine how many beats per minute the heart needs to make in order to reach that speed			2

the sensor will be sold with the new console , pictured centre , and both were available from midnight at stores across the @entity40 as blood passes through a person 's body , the skin changes colour ever so slightly			1
the new @entity13 camera can recognise these changes in colour in a person 's face to establish how fast the blood is pumping			2
by knowing the speed of the blood , the camera can then determine how many beats per minute the heart needs to make in order to reach that speed			2
the feature is set to be used while players use fitness apps , but could also be used to measure how scared someone is during a film , for example			0
@entity4 unveiled its @entity13 sensor as part of its @entity34 event in june			1
the sensor will be sold with the new console and both are available from 22 november			1
as well as the heartrate monitor , @entity4 's sensor has an increased ' field of view ' that is now 60 per cent wider than the current @entity13			1
it can read up to six skeletons at once , compared to the current two , and its ' small object detection ' is said to be two - and - a - half times better			0
this means it can identify small movements of the hand on a controller , for example			0
the second - generation kinect sensor is also able to see faces , track eye movements and detect expressions , although the range of emotions is limited to happy , neutral and disinterested during the beta release			2
it is additionally said to be better at recognising features and body movements in the dark and dimly lit rooms because it uses what 's called active infrared ( @entity91 )			0
@entity91 works in a similar way to thermal imaging and is used in night - vision goggles , for example			0
other improvements that have been made include being able to tell which muscles are in use while the player uses a fitness app , for example , as well as the bodies orientation , pictured other improvements that have been made include being able to tell which muscles are in use while the player uses a fitness app , for example , and determine how much force is being applied when throwing a punch in a boxing game , or when jogging on the spot			0
the stronger pressure on a muscle , the stronger the colour , which range from red for a ' stressed ' muscle through to green when a muscle is relaxed			0
force is reflected in circles that appear around the limb throwing the kick or punch ; the larger the circle , the stronger the force			0
it can also track a person 's orientation			0
as well as the heartrate monitor , @entity4 's sensor can read up to six skeletons at once , compared to the current two			1

@entity4 's @entity13 sensor uses changes in skin colour to monitor heart rate
it can read beats per minute *wirelessly* on a person *standing* four feet away
kinect on the @entity34 can also detect slight eye and muscle movements
the sensor will be sold with the console from 22 november
