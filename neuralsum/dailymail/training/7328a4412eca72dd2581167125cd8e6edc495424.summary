by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity4 ’s plan to cut immigration could cost @entity6 £ 300billion , the official economic watchdog warned today			2
the @entity7 warned the loss of taxes paid by migrants would far outweigh the costs providing extra benefits or school and hospital places			2
the @entity17 plan to reduce net migration to below 100,000 would , over a 50 - year period , increase national debt by 20 per cent or £ 300billion in today ’s prices , the @entity7 claimed			1
@entity21 , chairman of the @entity7 , insisted migrants provide more in tax than they cost in public services mr @entity4 has pledged to reduce net migration to the ‘ tens of thousands ’ but last year it emerged net migration – the difference between people arriving and those leaving - had risen for the first time in two years to 182,000			1
the @entity7 has repeatedly put itself at odds with government policy on immigration , claiming in july that the @entity6 would need 7million extra immigrations over 50 years to meet the costs of caring for the elderly			1
today @entity7 chairman @entity21 told the @entity39 that immigration boosts national income			2
he argued that migrants are more likely than native @entity6 to be of working age and less likely to make use of benefits , pensions and healthcare - even after taking into account additional spending on schools , gp surgeries and hospitals to cater for incomers			0
prime minster @entity4 wants to cut net migration to under 100,000 but in the latest figures it rose to 182,000 mr @entity21 told @entity57 : ‘ essentially speaking , inward migrants are more likely to be of working age than the population in general			1
‘ they arrive after some other country has picked up the expense of educating them and in some cases - though not all cases - they leave the country again before you get to the point at which they are most expensive , in terms of pensions , healthcare and long - term care			0
‘ in terms of the fiscal position , that is what drives the fact that higher net inward migration over this time horizon does tend to produce a more beneficial picture			2
’ the @entity7 argues that allowing 140,000 immigrants of working age into @entity6 each year – totalling 7million over 50 years – would fill jobs and raise taxes for @entity89 coffers			1
the coalition is split on the issue of immigration , with @entity94 dem business secretary @entity93 dismissing the @entity17 target as unworkable and risking the economy			0
he was backed by mr @entity21 , he warned that with fewer inward migrants , ‘ the fiscal position would be somewhat worse ’			0
the @entity7 's @entity99 , produced last year , predicts that public sector net debt will stand at just under 100 per cent of gdp by 2063 if net migration continues at 140,000 a year			1
but it will reach as much as 140 per cent of gdp if it is reduced to zero			0
a half - way point , to model the impact of cutting net migration to the tens of thousands , would lead to a rise in debt as a proportion of gdp of around 20 per cent , the committee was told			1
open door policy : without high levels of migration to @entity6 , public debt will balloon to become larger than the entire economy , the @entity7 said conservative committee member @entity116 asked whether the @entity7 had taken into account additional spending on services like nursery and school places for migrants ' children and the extra demands they make on gp surgeries and hospitals			1
mr @entity21 stressed that future governments have the power to alter the fiscal outcome of a shift in migration levels by changing policies in other areas : ‘ clearly if you made a choice on migration , or an assumption on migration , that made the fiscal position look better or worse , then you could adjust other policies to compensate for that			0
‘ there is no level of net inward migration you have to have for there to be fiscal sustainability			0
it 's an influence on a whole variety of other choices government has to make			0

@entity4 wants to reduce net migration to the ' tens of thousands '
@entity7 says foreign workers needed to raise tax
over 50 years *cap* on immigration would increase public debt by 20 *%*
