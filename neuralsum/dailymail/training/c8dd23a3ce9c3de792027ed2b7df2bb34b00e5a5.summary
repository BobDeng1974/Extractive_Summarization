by @entity0 for centuries people have marked the passing of time using the moon ’s phases			2
but only now is the world 's first moon clock being planned , which will use tidal power to display the moon 's phase on its ' face '			2
the huge sculpture is intended to sit at the historic centre of time at @entity15 , @entity16 , as part of a huge redevelopment of the @entity15 peninsula			1
the huge sculpture is intended to sit at the historic centre of time at @entity15 , as part of a huge redevelopment of the @entity15 peninsula size : 131ft ( 40metres ) wide and 43ft ( 13metres ) tall			1
materials : recycled glass will be used for the rings			0
power : the clock would use tidal power to turn turbines and generate electricity			0
location : @entity15 , on the bank of the @entity40 to the west of the @entity42			0
cost : around £ 6million with an estimate of £ 9.6million for the whole project			1
opening date : autumn 2016 if all goes to plan			0
the clock , which is called @entity47 , will measure 131ft ( 40 metres ) wide and 43ft ( 13metres ) high if it is built on the bank of the @entity40 , just west of the @entity42 , as planned			1
it would be made of three concentric glass rings with leds beneath the surface , producing light powered by tidal turbines			1
the recycled glass rings would show the waxing , waning , rising and setting of the moon , along with the ebb and flow of the tides			1
by looking at how each of the rings are illuminated , people will be able to tell the phase and position of the moon and the height of the tides			2
the ‘ flow of light ’ will move slowly and continuously around the structure in a clockwise direction , according to the project ’s creators			0
an artist 's impression of the moon clock , which will form part of the redevelopment of @entity15			1
@entity47 will be powered by the very thing it is designed to measure - the moon			1
the moon creates the tides and the clock will transform them into kinetic energy and then electricity by using turbines that are planned to sit in the @entity40 the largest ring , called the ' @entity92 ' , would show the waxing and waning of the moon , which takes 29.5 calendar days			1
at @entity99 , the unlit ring would begin to gradually ‘ wax ’ on and by full moon , the whole ring will light up so that the circle of light is complete			0
the ring would then ‘ wane ’ back to its unlit state and the cycle would begin again			0
the 24 hour 50 minute @entity107 is represented by a ring positioned half way between the first ring and the ground			0
a band of light is intended to point to the moon ’s position in the sky and when it is below the horizon , there will be a ring lit below a viewer ’s feet			2
a smaller band of light will follow the progress of the tides , with each cycle taking 12 hours and 25 minutes			2
the recycled glass rings ( illustrated ) would show the waxing , waning , rising and setting of the moon , along with the ebb and flow of the tides			1
by looking at how each of them is illuminated , people would be able to tell the phase and position of the moon and the height of the tides the largest ring shows the wax and wane of the moon , the middle ring the 24hour 50 minute @entity107 and the smallest , the progress of the tides ( all pictured ) the clock is intended to be visible 24 hours a day as it would emit white light in the dark , which would fade as the sun rises , while the edges of the structure are designed to be lit up with coloured @entity155 to save a little energy			1
if built , @entity157 will be powered by the very thing it is designed to measure – the moon			2
it is well known that the moon creates the tides and the clock would transform them into kinetic energy and then electricity by using turbines that are planned to sit in the @entity40			1
efficient use of renewable energy is one of the project 's primary objectives and when the largest ring is unlit around @entity99 , the clock would conserve more energy than it uses and store it for @entity175 times the team behind the project says it has had a favourable response from @entity179 who have agreed to the clock in principle			0
an initial feasibility report has been submitted to the authority ahead of the formal plans , which are set to be unveiled and lodged in the summer			0
a spokesman for the project said : ‘ @entity47 will be the world 's first tidal powered moon clock , and a monumental timepiece for @entity15 , @entity16 , the @entity191 and the world			1
’ construction would take around 16 months and the organisers hope the project will be completed in autumn 2016 in time for the lunar eclipse set for that year			0
the people behind the project , including @entity16 - based artist @entity199 , who came up with the design in 2002 when studying art at @entity202 , @entity16 , hope it will change the way people consider time and understand our planet			0
the mayor of @entity16 , @entity209 , said the clock ‘ would showcase the best of @entity191 creativity and engineering and offer inspiring opportunities for intercultural dialogue and understanding			0
‘ powered by the tidal river @entity40 and built from glass recycled by @entity220 themselves , a world first like @entity47 would draw international visitors and engage @entity220			2
‘ @entity222 is identified as a @entity223 in the @entity224 and i believe @entity47 could act as a focal point for the cultural regeneration of this area			0
’ it is estimated that @entity47 could cost around £ 6million - with an estimated cost of £ 9.6million for the whole project - and is being funded from a variety of sources , including donations , sponsors and grants .			1

the sculpture is intended to sit at the historic centre of time at @entity15 and use tides to power the light - up clock
if built , @entity47 will measure 131ft ( 40 metres ) wide and 43ft ( 13metres ) high have three concentric glass rings that light up to show the waxing , waning , rising and setting of the moon , along with the ebb and flow of the tides
the clock , which could cost between around £ 6million is intended to be visible 24 hours a day as it would emit white light in the dark , which would fade as the sun rises
