by @entity0 published : 19:18 est , 12 may 2013 updated : 19:18 est , 12 may 2013 the catwalks were full of white for this summer			2
the models were like ghosts - or at least looked as though they were still in their nighties			0
@entity6 showed a white mesh blouson , @entity8 a white blouse and skater skirt edged with orange , @entity15 a white cotton blouse and skirt in broderie anglaise			1
@entity16 even sent out a white broderie anglaise jumpsuit , with side cleavage exposed			1
now i have a little bit of a problem with a grown woman wearing broderie anglaise , a crisp holey fabric meant only for children			1
this fabric , especially in a maxi skirt , reminds me of that dreadful fashion trend : boho			2
@entity30 is meant to look stiff , and clean , as though cut from expensive writing paper , but the boho appropriation rendered it sloppy , tiered and creased			0
@entity34 2013 @entity35 , left , and @entity36 during @entity38 fashion week. , right but white can be wonderful , especially in a crisp white shirt or extra thick , extra-long white t - shirt ( when i had money , i would relegate a perfect white gap tee to its next incarnation as a duster after one wear )			1
@entity47 does the best white tee in the world - thick , with a tiny pocket - but if you want to eat this month , try the new range at @entity53 instead			2
a washing tip : do n't over-heat , and add a touch of @entity56 , which avoids any yellowing			0
pairing white jeans with a @entity60 top , or navy blazer , will take you anywhere , but anything head - to - toe white i find slightly problematic : you might look like @entity64 , as though you have misplaced your insane asylum patient			1
so if you choose this look you must add a touch of colour somewhere : in an orange belt or bag , a zingy shoe , an embellished neckline or at least fluorescent nails			1
far better is to choose just one piece in white : i love @entity77 's leather mini skirt , and its longline silk tuxedo jacket ( @entity79 , £ 195 ) , which is great over anything : shorts , brown legs and flats on holiday , or even a long dress for evening , sleeves pushed up to the elbow			1
a black tux looks great with white stilettos , which are no longer considered @entity89 at all			1
( @entity90 has a mid-heel stiletto , @entity92 , for £ 125			2
) a fantastic little book is how to wear @entity94 , by @entity95 ( @entity96 , £ 12.99 ) , whose author , rather perversely , believes ‘ white suits very few people '			1
it warns that any bride over the age of 35 should eschew this colour entirely , an edict i find a tad harsh			2
better than pure white , she advises , is to choose something that is just ‘ off '			2
@entity94 , of course , comes in many shades , from ivory to chalk , so it should n't be hard to avoid pure or paper white			2
my advice ? never wear white when your dress is long : it can look too bridey			2
coats in white are problematic too : you will spend a fortune on dry cleaning			0
a white bag is perfect for a wedding ( please do n't carry your old battered , sagging , scuffed work bag anywhere this summer ) , but it must be blemish - free : my trick is to use the soft cloth bag you bought it in as a sort of extra lining inside , and never , ever carry a @entity127 , or touch it when there is any trace of foundation on your fingers			1
underwear must be nude or white , with no twiddly bits , as white can be see - through			0
white fabrics i 'd avoid ( as well as broderie anglaise ) include lace , linen and embroidery of any sort - it gets a bit @entity143			1
a sheer panel in white looks very fresh : see @entity77 's @entity148 skirt with sheer stripe , or @entity6 's sheer shirt			1
my favourite look for summer is an oversized wool sweater in school uniform grey ( by @entity154 ) over a sheer white shirt ( @entity156 , @entity157 & @entity158 do long white shirts in voile ) with tails poking out from beneath			0
my top white buys for summer i thought i would give the nice people at @entity164 a little challenge			0
so on the day of my visit i wore a pair of dirty wellies , had no make - up on , which tends to frighten people , and took along my border collie , @entity172			0
oh , and i was carrying two heavy bags			0
and an extension lead , so @entity172 could roam at weird angles , threatening to trip me up in a cat 's cradle			0
@entity0 was impressed with the service in @entity164 on @entity178 , especially since she brought her dog shopping with her to my surprise , the doorman opened the door for my motley load , nodded , smiled , and even offered to hold my laptop while i browsed			0
@entity172 hovered perilously close to all the embellished trenches , and to the fur , and to the python , but not one impeccably dressed and very pretty sales assistant turned a hair			1
this store was full of tourists , unlike @entity193 opposite , which seemed as quiet as a country church in comparison			0
i asked for a cheap option for a wedding , which raised brows , as nothing there is cheap , although the staff were helpful , directing me towards simple cotton dresses , and a scarf , although even these summer scarves were £ 275			1
i did n't try anything on , as with a dog , it was far too complicated , plus i did n't want to get the sales assistants ' backs up by not buying anything			0
nevertheless , this store seemed welcoming and unsnooty			0
they only lose a point for not having a bowl of water near the door for dogs			0
