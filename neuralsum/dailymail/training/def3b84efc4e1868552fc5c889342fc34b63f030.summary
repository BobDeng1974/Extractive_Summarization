throughout history , dogs have constantly impressed humans with their intelligence			1
from guiding blind people around to sniffing out criminals , they are able to turn to a variety of tasks with ease			1
and as these astonishing pictures show , two - year - old @entity9 is following in that proud tradition			1
@entity22 and @entity23 decided to take @entity9 in from the animal shelter - but they had no idea they were adopting a canine artist			1
mr @entity28 said : ' when we tell people our dog paints , you can tell many of them do n't quite grasp the concept			1
' they think she uses her paw or her tail , then we show them video of her painting in action and their jaws drop and they say " oh my gosh , your dog paints "			2
creative : after being rescued from streets of @entity15 , @entity9 has gone on to astound her owners with her astonishing talents			1
she is pictured starting out on one of her creations clever : mr and mrs @entity23 said they could see straight away how intelligent @entity58 was ' neither one of us are artists so we had to learn about the craft as @entity58 became interested in it			2
' we were just looking for a companion and had no idea how much @entity9 would change our lives			2
' we saw right away how intelligent @entity9 was , picking up tricks with ease and mastering them			2
my wife decided to try something a little more challenging , painting			0
' with lots of positive reinforcement she learned to take the brush in her mouth , walk to the canvas and brush back and forth at just the right distance to make beautiful strokes			0
' since then she has only improved , becoming more creative with her strokes and picking up the brush on her own			0
' @entity9 has since performed live on television and before audiences at fundraising events			0
she even painted in front of the @entity88 in @entity15			1
impressive : the former homeless pup has learned to take the brush in her mouth , walk to the canvas and brush back and forth at just the right distance to make beautiful strokes proud : @entity9 is pictured with a completed painting mr @entity28 said the money from @entity58 's paintings goes towards helping other animals in need			0
' @entity9 sells most of her paintings to raise money for animals in need across the country			0
' her highest selling painting fetched $ 453 - around Â£ 300 - with 100 percent of the net proceeds going to an animal charity in @entity111			1
we sell most of her paintings via @entity114 , in an auction format			0
