@entity0 and @entity1 meet in the @entity2 on saturday lunchtime with a place in the top four at stake			1
the hosts trail the fifth - placed @entity8 by just two points and would leapfrog them and jump into a @entity11 berth with victory			1
in - form @entity1 , though , will be out to extend a five - match winning run in which they have kept four clean sheets			1
here , @entity16 takes a closer look at the strength of the rivals and picks our best xi from the two squads ... goalkeeper – @entity24 if @entity25 does n’t fancy @entity26 then we ca n’t either			1
that leaves @entity28 competing with @entity24 for the @entity30 jersey and , for us , there ’s no contest			2
sweeper - keeper @entity24 not only bails his backline out with his hands , but he ’s also pretty useful with his feet , repeatedly vacating his penalty area to avert danger			2
he ’s arguably the best keepers in the @entity39			2
@entity24 has developed into one of the best goalkeepers in the @entity39 right back – @entity42 neither team is blessed with great quality in this area			1
@entity46 has failed to mature into the @entity48 regular we thought he would , while @entity1 ’s @entity50 has not made the impact expected of him at the @entity52 this season and has been out of the side during their recent good form			1
that leaves @entity42 as the default selection , but even then it is a reluctant one given his injury record this season			2
on his day , however , he is aggressive in both defence and attack and the best north @entity62 has to offer			2
@entity63 international @entity42 beats @entity0 's @entity46 to the right back spot @entity66 backs – @entity67 & @entity68 @entity0 ’ @entity69 is the obvious pick to marshal the rearguard			1
the @entity72 is a class act and one of the first names on the team - sheet at @entity77			1
@entity78 has started to impress of late but it is @entity1 ’s @entity68 who gets the nod to partner @entity69			1
he is a far safer bet than @entity82 , who has struggled for form this season in the wake of his @entity87 triumph with @entity88			0
it 's one from each team in the centre of defence as @entity67 lines up with @entity68 ( right ) @entity94 – @entity95 there ’s not a great deal between @entity95 and @entity98			1
both are pacey , join the attack at every opportunity and boast great recovery at the other end			0
but it is @entity95 who gets the nod			0
were it not for injuries then he would have established himself as @entity48 ’s best left back and , given @entity110 ’s failure to impact at @entity111 this season , @entity95 , at 25 , could make the position his own should he maintain his fitness			0
@entity1 left back @entity95 , who struggles with injuries , gets the nod ahead of @entity98 right midfield – @entity117 @entity118 is still struggling to build on last season ’s breakthrough and the jury remains very much out on his credentials as a top @entity39 player			1
but at @entity1 there is no doubting that @entity117 is the real deal			1
@entity48 were robbed of the daring and direct dribbler at the @entity87 and , at his best , he should be a certain starter for both club and country			0
@entity117 bursts past @entity131 midfielder @entity130 in january @entity133 midfield – @entity134 there are a host of candidates to fill the central - midfield berth , not least @entity139 , who has been outstanding for @entity0 this season			1
@entity142 is beginning to make a similar impact with the @entity8 , while @entity144 was proving his critics wrong before injury struck , again			0
but it is the class and composure of @entity134 which wins him the role in the middle of the park			0
with just six goals this season he should be offering more in that department , but the @entity154 is the heartbeat of the side and one of the best midfielders in the division			0
@entity134 wins midfield berth beating competition from the @entity139 and @entity142 attacking midfield – @entity161 again , we are spoilt for choice in this domain			0
@entity165 showed his silk during the recent win at @entity168 and is a pleasure to watch at his best			0
consistency , though , remains a concern with the @entity172 , as it does with team - mate @entity174 , who , while mesmerising on his day , defines ‘ flaky ’ in the games in which he goes missing , and that happens far too often			2
this position , then , belongs to just one man – @entity161			0
the @entity179 has been nothing short of incredible this season and has 11 goals already , proving the match - winner on countless occasions			0
@entity161 has been in superb form for @entity0 this season , netting 11 goals in all competitions left midfield – @entity188 @entity189 has found his feet this season after a difficult first campaign			1
@entity188 , however , remains the best threat from a wide position on the books at either @entity62 club			0
since returning from injury he has proved his worth and his devastating pace – allied to an increasing composure – makes @entity188 an invaluable asset			2
@entity188 scored his first @entity39 goal since returning from a serious knee injury second striker – @entity204 you could put the @entity206 anywhere across the frontline and he would terrify the opposition			0
his debut season in the @entity39 has been mightily impressive , not least because he marries graft to his craft			0
his return of 18 goals speaks for itself and @entity204 is looking like the signing of the season			0
remind us why @entity219 let him go ? @entity204 has enjoyed a brilliant start life at @entity1 and has scored 18 goals in all competitions striker – @entity223 the 21 - year - old has seen them all off at @entity77 and @entity226 and @entity227 can not get close to what @entity223 offers the team in terms of goals and overall contribution			1
he has 20 goals this term and is undoubtedly the biggest success story of the season so far			0
rivalling him for our no 9 jersey are @entity239 and @entity240 , but a return of eight and seven goals respectively means @entity223 gets the pick , just as he should do when @entity245 names his next @entity48 team			2
@entity223 has been a revelation this season , scoring more goals than any other @entity39 player sports analysts , @entity250 , believe an @entity1 win is the most likely outcome in the north @entity62 derby			1

@entity0 take on @entity1 in the @entity2 at @entity77
the team go into the clash separated by just two points and one place
