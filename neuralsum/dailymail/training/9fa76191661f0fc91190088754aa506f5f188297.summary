by @entity0 the @entity2 military has spent $ 34million building a state - of - the - art building on a base in southern @entity5 that no @entity2 soldiers will ever use			1
military officials warned that the proposed building was an example of wasteful spending three years ago when the construction began but their warnings went unheeded and the contractors built the expansive two - story facility anyway			1
now a special inspector general who is reviewing spending in @entity5 has written a scathing letter to the secretary of defense saying that the building , which is in the compound of @entity21 , is symbolic of the overwhelming bureaucracy in the region			1
seats to fill : the command and control facility at @entity21 in southern @entity5 cost $ 34million ghost town : the two - story facility will now likely be demolished because @entity2 troops are being pulled out of the region , and it will be too expensive for the fledgling @entity5 army to maintain ' unfortunately , it is unused , unoccupied , and presumably will never be used for its intended purpose , ' @entity32 , the special inspector general for @entity5 reconstruction , wrote in a letter to @entity38			1
' this is an example of what is wrong with military construction in general â € ” once a project is started , it is very difficult to stop			0
' one senior @entity2 military official told me that this facility was designed for a military division that was never deployed and , subsequently , a decision was made not to construct the facility , but inexplicably the building construction started and is now complete			2
' in order to make it useable by anyone , communications equipment must still be bought and installed , which mr @entity32 estimates will cost $ 3million more			0
no plans to share : the facility , the briefing room of which is shown above , was deemed unnecessary by insiders three years ago when construction began three years ago but they went ahead anyway under investigation : a special inspector general is now looking into why construction on the building went ahead in spite of calls by military officers to save the money ' i am deeply concerned that ( @entity2 @entity72 ) may be spending additional taxpayer dollars on a facility no one will ever use , ' he wrote			1
the @entity75 reports that the 64,000 - foot facility features spacious offices with unused furniture , powerful air conditioners and security systems up to the military 's high standards			0
the problem , however , is that president @entity84 already announced the scheduled withdrawal of @entity2 troops from the war - ravaged country			0
as a result , experts and military leaders in the country view the building on @entity21 as a waste			2
' what the hell were they thinking ? there was never any justification to build something this fancy , ' an unidentified two - star @entity95 told the @entity75			0
up in smoke : the facility on @entity21 is just one of a handful of multimillion dollar projects that are now left to rot in @entity5 as @entity2 troops prepare to leave the region the inspector general said that there are really just two possible prospects for the facility : it will be handed over to the @entity5 army or demolished entirely			1
obviously it would be better for the nascent national army to take advantage of the facility , but more problems lie there simply because it was built to high @entity2 standards with strong air conditioning units that require significant - and expensive - electricity , meaning the upkeep would be costly for the @entity5			1
on top of that , all of the electrical plugs were made for 110 - volt machines that @entity2 use , as opposed to the 220 - volt products used by locals , making it even likely that it will be demolished			2
the completion of the building just adds to the growing outrage over other multimillion dollar projects that have been commissioned throughout the region			0
passing the torch : the @entity5 army will take over some of the @entity2 bases when the @entity2 troops leave but not all of them ( prime minister @entity139 toured @entity21 in 2011 ) the @entity75 also cites two other controversial spending projects that have been tossed aside			1
the military spent $ 45million on a repair facility that was intended to fix armored vehicles , but now it is being used as a staging area to sort through military equipment due to be shipped out of the country			0
an even more glaring example of wasteful spending is the building the military poured more than $ 80million into in northern @entity5 that they planned to use as an @entity2 consulate			2
after paying for the refurbishment and the 10 - year lease , the facility was deemed too unsafe and a clear target for terrorist attacks , so it remains unused .			0

a two - story facility was built on @entity21 in southern @entity5 in spite of official warnings that it was unnecessary
now a special inspector general is looking into why the building *process* went ahead anyway , and what will come of it now
building is too costly for the @entity5 army to maintain , and the *outlets* wo *n't* even work for their equipment because they are @entity2 plugs
just one of a handful of similar expensive projects that were laid to waste
