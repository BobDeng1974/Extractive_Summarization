@entity1 's athletes prospered at the @entity2 and @entity3 but you have to look further for one of the sport ’s best tales			0
@entity8 , a 17 - year - old former @entity9 youth rugby player from @entity10 , ran 20.37sec in the 200 metres heats at the @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 in july			1
the only man faster at that age ? @entity16			1
of course , ‘ the next @entity16 ’ tag is overused and unfair , and @entity8 has his head screwed on the right way to know that			1
speaking during a free period at school , he is humble , bright and driven to succeed			0
only @entity16 was faster at 17 in the 200m than @entity24 sensation @entity8 @entity8 ran the distance in 20.37sec at the @entity11 in july this year ‘ i ’m still trying to get my head around it , it ’s all a bit weird , ’ he said			1
‘ it ’s such an accolade , it ’s something amazing that i do n’t think i ’ll ever forget			2
‘ the moment they told me about @entity16 my face gleamed with joy and i said , “ are you serious ? ” ’ somers finished seventh in the final the following day , but the schoolboy ’s semi-final time , joint - second with @entity42 ’s 20.37sec in @entity43 in 2001 , has given him even more hunger to reach the top			1
he does n’t mind the @entity16 tag			1
‘ i do n’t think i ’ve got used to people saying it , it ’s such a good thing to be called			0
it ’s such an honour to be up there with him			0
‘ it ’s unbelievable to be classed in the same bracket as the fastest man in the world			0
to say that i ’m second on the all - time list to him is amazing			1
‘ he ’s definitely somebody i really look up to and appreciate everything he has done for the sport ; the times he ’s run , his technique			2
’ @entity16 ’s time of 20.13sec in @entity65 in 2003 remains out of reach , but @entity8 ’ bright future is testament to his intriguing story			1
he quit rugby having played in @entity70 ’s academy , and even appeared for @entity72 northern side at the @entity73 last year			2
it was a tough decision but his love for running started at an early stage in his life			0
from the age of four until 11 , he ran 1.5 - mile and three - mile fun runs while his parents did the 10k events			1
but he loved the rugby too and it took the intervention of another sprint sensation to make his mind up			2
his decision was thanks partly to the advice of @entity91			0
in @entity93 , @entity94 , in the summer , the two exchanged words			0
@entity8 had previously sustained a broken wrist playing for his school team , and @entity91 , @entity98 200m champion , further encouraged him to stick to the track rather than the wing			1
@entity8 represented @entity9 rugby at youth level before quitting to focus on athletics @entity8 is aiming to take his place int he @entity105 , when he will be aged just 19 ‘ he basically told me i should n’t be playing rugby , ’ recalled @entity8			1
‘ he used to play football for quite a long time — he said that i ’d get injured and spoil my chances and the times i ’ve been achieving			0
it ’s been good advice so far ! ‘ once i broke my wrist i gained @entity117 funding , which coincided quite nicely and now i just focus on athletics			0
‘ @entity119 is a team game , athletics is obviously more individual , but i liked the competitiveness of both			0
’ the @entity117 is a @entity125 - run scheme directed by double @entity128 high jumper @entity126 aimed at getting more @entity129 on the podium			1
@entity8 took advice from fellow sprinter @entity91 before quitting rugby the 17 - year - old quit rugby having played in @entity70 ’s academy , and even appeared for @entity72 16s northern side at the @entity73 last year it helps with everything from equipment to travel to general advice , and has got @entity141 this far			1
but what ’s next ? he will be 19 when the @entity144 comes along , but his goals for that and beyond show his ambitious side			1
‘ over the next two years , i ’d like to keep improving at the same rate and i ’d like to go to @entity105 in 2016			2
‘ i think it could be achievable , but my main goal is @entity151 ( @entity152 )			0
‘ next year i ’ll be trying to qualify for the @entity153 and try to pick up my first international medal			2
i ’ve been to two international events and have made the final , but have n’t come away with a medal			0
that ’s definitely the aim			0
’ his main goal is to represent @entity1 at the 2017 @entity152 in @entity161 @entity8 has the winter to improve , while keeping more than a keen eye on his studies at @entity165 in @entity166 , where teachers give him extended deadlines when he has important races coming up			1
‘ there are a lot of decisions about where i want to go and what i want to do , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’ve got quite a few universities in mind , such as @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 , but it ’s all about getting the grades before i can make those decisions			2
’ one thing is clear , the @entity16 tag has no danger of catapulting his feet off the ground			2
@entity8 is supported by @entity187 for 2014 - 15 , which provides targeted support for young athletes and their coaches			1

@entity8 ran 200m in 20.37sec at 2014 @entity11

@entity8 says that is amazing to draw *comparisons* with @entity16
the 17 - year - old is aiming to make the @entity144 in 2016
