stranger than fiction : the life of @entity2 by @entity3 @entity5 has always produced — and attracted — spectacular characters			1
none was more spectacular , in his day , than @entity2			1
he was simply the most prolific and successful popular journalist - novelist of the start of the 20th century — as much of a household name as any filmstar , politician or writer ; as recognisable as @entity14 or @entity15 , @entity16 or @entity17			1
i grew up avidly reading his adventure stories about the rulers of the @entity21 , such as @entity22 , and mysteries , such as @entity24			1
cascades of thrillers poured from him , as well as many hit @entity29 plays			1
@entity21 crime writer , @entity2 was the most prolific and successful popular journalist - novelist of the start of the 20th century you could n’t keep up with him			1
he was also one of the sights of the @entity29 , where his yellow @entity33 was instantly recognised			1
he liked to keep it and his chauffeur waiting outside his hotel or club , in case he should suddenly want to go racing — which he did a great deal			1
to me , he was a legend of early @entity5 , especially of @entity43 ’s @entity42			2
like many hopeful young journalists , i stood in @entity45 , where @entity5 begins , looking at his profile set in a wall plaque and reading the inscription : ‘ of his talents he gave lavishly to authorship — but to @entity5 he gave his heart ’			2
what makes this so poignant is that it is set above the spot where @entity2 stood aged 11 in 1886 , selling a newspaper called @entity58 , which brought in his only income of three shillings a week			1
an orphan , he was given away as a baby by his touring actress mother and raised by a billingsgate fish porter and his family as foster parents			1
he was fated , obviously , to be a labourer all his life			2
his escape into the playgrounds of the gilded rich he owed entirely to his pen , his fecund imagination and his insatiable appetite for work			2
he had huge talent , but hardly any writer , except perhaps @entity77 , has turned out books as quickly and as successfully as @entity2 did			1
staggering statistics abound in this story			2
let ’s settle for a few : in four years of the @entity82 , @entity2 published 74 books — equivalent to one title almost every three weeks			1
it was claimed that a quarter of new books sold in @entity88 in those years were by him			2
in 1965 , more than 30 years after his death , his worldwide sales were claimed to top 50 million in 28 languages			2
ah , but he is little known to younger generations today			2
so were they so much trash , mere @entity95 ? they ca n’t have been			2
1933 : a scene from the classic monster movie ' @entity99 ' , the book was written by @entity2 the thriller , like the detective story , was then the new fashion , and @entity2 combined the appeal of both			1
many of his stories revolved around the unmasking of a @entity109 - like villain concealed among the leading characters			1
‘ can you guess which ? ’ was a game he played with his readers			2
unlike the stuffy , upper - middle - class settings and characters of @entity116 or @entity117 , his lower - class or classless characters are convincing			1
he was one of them			2
his criminal gangs , locked - room murder mysteries , multiple disguises and chases were always inventive and sensational			1
‘ you ca n’t fail to be thrilled by @entity2 , ’ promised the blurb			1
those who were thrilled included the highest in the land			2
@entity129 bought four to read to a sickly @entity130 ( admittedly not known as an intellectual )			2
prime ministers @entity132 and @entity134 were fans , and the famous barrister @entity136 , lord @entity137 , said he had never failed to be excited by a @entity138			2
@entity139 complained he could n’t find anything new to read until the next @entity2 appeared			1
dozens of his stories have since been filmed and televised			2
he himself wrote and sometimes directed his own films			2
he was script - writing in @entity145 when he died unexpectedly in 1932 of pneumonia , possibly aggravated by his years of chain - smoking through a long cigarette holder , which was his trademark			1
the long catalogue of his successes can not help but become repetitive in @entity3 ’s workman - like chronicle			1
the most interesting passages describe how @entity2 fought his way out of poverty and into journalism			1
his very name was fiction			0
the name ‘ @entity2 ’ was made up — it was claimed to be that of his father when his birth was registered by his mother , the touring actress @entity163			1
his actual father was the son of her company manager , who was about to marry someone else			0
she did n’t care to embarrass him			0
the boy ( and later the man ) was known by his first name , @entity172 or @entity173			0
‘ @entity2 ’ was the surname of his real father and ‘ @entity2 ’ never existed			1
leaving school at 12 , which was then the rule , he kept changing one menial job for another until , in desperation , he joined the army at @entity182			0
soon , he was sent to @entity183 for the start of the @entity185 as a medical orderly			0
he had been writing verses for local magazines in @entity189 when @entity190 was to pay a visit			0
his welcoming verse in @entity190 ’s style appeared on the front page of the @entity195			0
@entity190 was tickled by it and invited him to dinner			0
so a working - class private soldier - poet hobnobbed with @entity88 ’s most famous author			1
he contributed verse to other papers , became a local columnist , then a war correspondent for @entity206 news agency , covering the @entity21 forces fighting the @entity208			0
these reports were picked up by the new @entity42 , first published in 1896			0
the @entity42 made him its own correspondent			0
@entity2 ’s ingenuity in getting round the fierce censorship of news gave the @entity42 several scoops , including the long - awaited peace declaration			1
@entity43 , the future @entity216 , welcomed his young reporter back to @entity218 with a celebration dinner			0
@entity2 became the @entity42 ’s top reporter — until he was fired by @entity43 for having trusted a false tip about a mutiny that never was			1
by then , he was addicted to horse - racing			1
he became a racing writer and tipster for several papers			0
his adventure stories were beginning to sell			0
the money was coming in			0
so , he took the plunge as an author			0
deciding that his typing took too long , he began to dictate his stories to a trusted typist , direct to the page			0
he reached the point where he could start dictating at midnight on a friday and have a 75,000 book complete in typescript by the following monday			0
o ne of the jokes triggered by his productivity was of a man who asked for him on the telephone and was told , ‘ mr @entity2 is writing a book			1
’ ‘ fine , ’ said the caller , ‘ i ’ll hold on			0
’ he earned plenty of money , but spent it as fast as it came in			0
men who begin life in great poverty often hang onto their wealth			0
he loved spending it — not just on himself , but on others			0
for @entity254 week , he took a box with its own restaurant and invited dozens of friends to enjoy the racing with him			0
he would tell them he had put £ 10 on the last race for each of them			0
whichever horse won , he would claim this had been the one they had backed — and he paid out all his guests , often out of his own pocket			0
in the course of this overworked life , he acquired two wives , sometimes living amicably with both in a ménage - a - trois			1
when he died , his debts far outweighed his bank account			0
everything — houses , racehorses , motor cars — had to be sold			0
a year later , the motion picture he had been working on in @entity145 appeared			0
it was @entity99 — billed as ‘ @entity2 ’s @entity280 ’			1
in fact , the script he wrote was mostly unused and the ideas were partly his and partly those of a co-writer called @entity286			0
however , it was all his idea that @entity99 climbed the @entity288 — which is what everyone remembers .			0

@entity2 was given away as a baby by his touring actress mother
he was raised by a billingsgate fish porter and his family as foster parents
he went on to become the 20th century *'s* most prolific journalist - novelist
