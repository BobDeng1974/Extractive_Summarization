by @entity0 two men officially became the first same - sex couple to legally marry in @entity3 on friday			0
the only catch was , as soon as they stepped outside the @entity8 consulate in @entity9 where the ceremony took place , their partnership was not recognised under @entity3 law			1
one half of the history - making couple said despite being the first to marry abroad under new @entity8 marriage equality legislation , he and his husband were simply trying to adhere to tradition			2

in march same - sex marriage became legal in @entity30 and @entity31 , and the marriage equality laws are now extended to 24 other countries , including @entity3			0

mr @entity21 ( right ) said he and husband mr @entity20 ( left ) should n't have been forced to seek the protection of another country 's law the men married wearing traditional @entity53 dress as a nod to their @entity57 heritage having lived in @entity3 for 19 years , the men hope they do n't have to wait too long for their marriage to be legal in their home country ' i hope soon also that all @entity3 will be able to marry the person that they love here in @entity3 with their family and friends around us as we have done , but without the need to seek to protection of the laws of another country			1
