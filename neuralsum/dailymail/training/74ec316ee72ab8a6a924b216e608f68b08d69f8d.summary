by @entity0 once the exclusive preserve of science fiction , manufacturers have promised motorists that space age cars will soon become science fact			2
the quest for effortless travelling will take a major new step forward when ' gesture control ' motoring is unveiled			0
car manufacturers are working on a system that will allow drivers to many of the internal controls by moving their hands close to sensor panels			2
the new ' gesture control ' is being pioneered by several manufacturers with @entity20 unveiling a mock - up at the @entity23 motor show ( file picture ) the system will enable motorists to operate lights , indicators and open and close doors all with a simple gesture			1
it will also mean the end to door handles as the person holding the keys will be able to open the car doors by a swiping movement			2
the move is the latest in a series of technological advances that are set to revolutionise motoring			0
but there are fears blank key fobs could be programmed by hacking through the security system in the car 's computer to allow thieves to drive the vehicle away			1
the new ' gesture control ' is being pioneered by several manufacturers with @entity20 unveiling a mock - up at the @entity23 motor show			1
the vehicle featured doors without handles and no indicators with both being operated by gestures			2
drivers of the @entity58 are already able to open their boots when they waggle a foot under the rear bumper ( file picture ) the technology works by using cameras to capture the driver 's movements with software interpreting specific hand movements and then passing the information on to the car ' computer			1
dr @entity72 , research and technology director at @entity74 , told the @entity75 : ' for safety reasons some functions will be hardwired with switches , but many others could be operated by gesture control			0
' we recognise that it is substantially more intuitive to use gestures than to press a button or turn a switch			0
' a number of different controls are being developed for ' gesture ' software with manufacturers saying windows , indicators , door locking and turning lights on and off could all be part of the new system			1
some ' gesture control ' is already used in cars with drivers of the @entity58 able to open their boots when they waggle a foot under the rear bumper			0
@entity103 has also applied for a patent for a swipe gesture system to lower or raise a window			0
@entity107 , professor of computing science at @entity108 , who previously worked for @entity58 , laid down a warning saying : ' its use has to be carefully tuned for cars			0
' if you wave your hand in annoyance at a car going by and suddenly the music 's blasting at you , it could be distracting enough to be dangerous			1

technology works by using cameras to capture the driver 's movements
software then interprets specific hand movements for a car 's computer
system will enable motorists to operate lights , indicators and doors
it is pioneered by several maker with @entity20 unveiling a mock - up
