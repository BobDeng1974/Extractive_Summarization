during this sunday 's @entity2 , for the first time ever , the @entity0 will air a commercial that deals with the horrors of domestic violence head - on			1
the 60 - second spot is part of the @entity0 's ongoing affiliation with no more - a coalition of groups dedicated to fighting domestic abuse - and is a dramatization based on a real 911 phone call in which a female victim appeals for help by pretending to order a pizza			1
no characters or scenes of violence are shown on the video			0
instead , audio of the chilling call is played as the camera pans around the victim â€™s home , which shows signs of a recent altercation : like a fist - shaped hole in the wall and a smashed photo frame			0
dark : at this sunday 's @entity2 , for the first time ever , the @entity0 will air a commercial ( pictured ) that deals with the horrors of domestic violence head - on the @entity0 donated the airtime for the spot and paid @entity38 , a @entity40 ad agency , to produce it			1
it will air during the first quarter of sunday 's game , as part of the football league 's ongoing effort to take a stand against domestic violence - a contentious subject given a string of recent scandals regarding some of its players			1
in the spot , a woman calls 911 and tells the operator her address , immediately before saying she 'd like to order a large pizza			0
eerie : no characters or scenes of violence appear , simply a dramatized voiceover based on a real 911 phone call in which a female victim appeals for help by pretending to order a pizza ' ma'am you 've reached 911 - this is an emergency line , ' the operator responds , but the woman pushes on , insisting she 'd like to order a pepperoni and mushroom pizza and asking nervously , ' do you know how long it will be ? the operator , catching on , asks if the woman is actually having an emergency , to which she curtly responds , ' yes			2
' ' is there someone in the room with you ? ' asks the operator			0
' yes ' , the woman responds			0
the operator then informs the caller that help is on its way , before she hastily hangs up and the commercial ends with the line : ' when it 's hard to talk , it 's up to us to listen			0
' amid the flurry of high - octave @entity2 ads starring beer , cute puppies and scantily - clad women , @entity91 's tense spot is likely to stand out by a mile			0
home : as the woman speaks in code to the operator under the guise of ordering the pizza , we see signs of an altercation including a fist - shaped hole in the wall ( left ) and a smashed photo frame ( right ) according to @entity112 , the commercial will also run on digital channels and get promotion from celebrity supporters			0
the pre-release of no more 's spot comes just weeks after the @entity118 reached a settlement in the disturbing domestic violence case that led to football star @entity122 's suspension from the game			1
while the terms of the settlement have not been released , mr @entity122 had been seeking more than $ 3.5 million for wrongful termination			1
the three - time @entity127 running back was released from the team after footage of him knocking out wife @entity132 - then his fiancee - in an elevator was released publicly by gossip site @entity136 in september			1
@entity137 : @entity122 ( pictured arriving at court with his wife @entity132 on november 5 ) and reached a settlement with the @entity118 over his termination from the team earlier this month shocking footage : the footballer was suspended from the @entity0 indefinitely after he was filmed punching mrs @entity132 with his left fist in an elevator at an @entity147 casino ( pictured ) brutal : elevator surveillance cameras caught the moment that mr @entity122 punched his then - fiancee in the face in an @entity147 casino elevator leaving her sprawled out on the floor the brutal assault saw mr @entity122 dragging his fiancee out of the elevator , sparked national outrage and highlighted the often overlooked issue of domestic violence in the @entity0			1
however , months after the assault , @entity118 president @entity160 said it is now time ' to turn the page ' on the incident			2
the @entity0 is still keen to show it is against domestic abuse , saying it will continue its work within the community on the issue of intimate partner abuse			2
mr @entity122 became a free agent earlier this month after former federal judge @entity171 overturned @entity0 commissioner @entity173 's indefinite suspension and reinstated him			1
but he has n't yet drawn interest from any teams			0
in december , mr @entity122 chose a @entity177 fundraiser collecting toys for needy children for his first public appearance since the video of him knocking out his wife in an elevator was released			1
on the field : during his appeal , mr @entity122 's lawyers and the union argued the league had overstepped its authority in modifying the player 's ( pictured ) two - game suspension , saying he was being ' sentenced ' twice the 27 - year - old attended the @entity194 fundraiser , held at the @entity195 in @entity196			1
during an interview , mr @entity122 said , ' it feels good to be out and among the @entity200 community and just to give back '			2
he also addressed the aggravated assault charges laid against him last year			0
' i made a horrible mistake in my life , but , you know , if you truly believe in second chances , you know , they will forgive me , ' mr @entity122 told @entity210			2

ruling : @entity0 commissioner @entity173 ( left ) had his decision overturned by former federal judge @entity171 , making mr @entity122 ( right ) a free agent more : there have been a spate of additional abuse cases among players including @entity219 star @entity218 ( left ) and @entity221 linebacker @entity220 ( right ) since the mr @entity122 incident brought the issue of abuse to the fore , there have been a spate of similarly shocking incidents with other @entity0 players			1
@entity219 star @entity218 , created a storm of controversy after he admitted to hitting his son with a switch			0
and earlier this month , @entity221 linebacker @entity220 denied allegations that he raped a woman at his apartment after the pair met during an evening of heavy drinking in early december			0
mr @entity220 was taken into police custody earlier this month after charges of rape , criminal confinement with bodily injury and battery resulting in bodily injury were filed against him .			0

it 's the first time the league has aired a spot which addresses domestic violence
the chilling 60 - second ad is part of the @entity0 's ongoing @entity260 campaign
