by @entity0 for @entity1 a race does n't have to be fast to be thrilling , and these two snails proved that after they battled their way towards a fruity prize			2
the lead swung to - and - fro as the hungry molluscs made their way up a toadstool - each seemingly as desperate as the other to claim the bright red cherry on top			2
the snail with the speckled shell took an early lead - as its spiral - shelled opponent got off to a slow start and was left dawdling at the bottom			1
fast start : @entity20 takes an early lead and already has its eyes on the extremely juicy prize but refusing to let the race slip away , @entity24 dragged itself back into contention - until the pair were neck - and - neck ( or antenna - and - antenna ) just below the fungus 's flat top			1
@entity24 looked as if it was about to pull off a classic underdog story as it hauled itself up over the lip first			0
but @entity20 is not one to play by the rules , and rather than going straight for the cherry itself , decided to fright dirty and attack its opponent instead			1
neck - and - neck : @entity24 hauls itself back level , and the unlikeliest of comebacks looks like it might be on playing dirty : @entity20 controversially tries to take out its opponent instead of going for the fruit itself however , as films have taught us , the good guy always prevails in the end			1
@entity24 managed to fight off its underhanded foe to victoriously slither up to take the juicy prize			0
it took a hard - earned chomp at the glazed fruit as @entity20 slunk back down the toadstool in disgrace - perhaps to consider its tactics for next time			1
comeback king : @entity24 fights off @entity20 's attacks and chows down on the bright red cherry the amusing sequence of photos was taken by macro photographer @entity63 , 48 , using his own pet snails			2
the @entity65 said : ' i love to create interesting scenarios for my pet snails			0
' i thought it would be fun to organise a race as snails are notorious for being slow creatures			0
' it was n't easy to photograph but once they noticed the cherry they definitely seemed to speed up			0
' unfortunately only one could win , but i did make sure they shared the winnings			0

spiral @entity20 and @entity82 go antenna - to - antenna for tasty prize
