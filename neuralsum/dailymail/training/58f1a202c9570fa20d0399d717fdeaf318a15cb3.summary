@entity0 have given an insight into what goes on in a @entity4 dressing room prior to a match			2
the @entity7 travelled to @entity8 to play @entity9 on sunday afternoon , and in a @entity10 posted on the club 's official @entity12 account , fans were shown around the away dressing room before the players arrived to begin their preparations			1
the video showed a table piled high with players ' drinks and snacks , as well as a strangely high volume of toilet roll			1
@entity26 's graphic shows exactly what was on @entity0 's dressing room table @entity0 players train on october 24th , but saturday showed us what the players enjoy off the pitch @entity33 ( right ) uses some of the energy he gained from a pre-match energy bar from the table , the players will tuck into specially designed Â£ 1.29 @entity41 go isotonic gels - in pink grapefruit and blackcurrant flavours - as well as mixed seed energy bars and oat and honey flavour @entity38 snack bars			1
the isotonic gels , made by @entity47 in @entity48 , provide a quick supply of energy to the player 's muscles and is designed to help the team work harder , for longer , during the match			0
and it seems to have worked , given that the @entity7 came away from @entity8 with a 1 - 2 victory			0
there was just one carton of @entity60 's ' 100 % juice ' , apple flavour , and twenty packs of spearmint chewing gum for the players to enjoy			2
as with the majority of professional football clubs , the players were free to take @entity48 drinks - orange flavour - as well as a supermarket own brand blue isotonic drink , which will have been picked up for 40p a piece			0
alongside the piles of toilet roll , there were tork rolls , as well as @entity75 to aid the players ' breathing during the match , and soothe aches and pains .			0

@entity0 posted a video on their @entity12 account inside the dressing room
