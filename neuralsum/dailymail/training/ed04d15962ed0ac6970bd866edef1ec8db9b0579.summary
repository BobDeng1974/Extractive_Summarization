by @entity0 threats : @entity2 has pledged to hold more rocket and nuclear tests after un-imposed sanctions			1
picture shows a @entity2 rocket launch from december @entity2 today said it would carry out further rocket launches and a nuclear test that would target the @entity10 , dramatically stepping up its threats against a country it called its ' sworn enemy '			1
in a statement carried by state media , the top military authority in @entity16 threatened to wage a ' full - fledged confrontation ' against the @entity10 for what it calls continued hostility			1
it comes a day after the @entity23 agreed to a @entity10 - backed resolution to censure and sanction @entity2 for a rocket launch in december that breached @entity23 rules			1
' we are not disguising the fact that the various satellites and long - range rockets that we will fire and the high - level nuclear test we will carry out are targeted at the @entity10 , ' @entity2 's @entity32 said , according to state news agency @entity33			1
the statement gave no time - frame for the test and did not explain what ' high - level ' test might mean			0
@entity2 is believed by @entity40 and other observers to be ' technically ready ' for a third nuclear test , and the decision to go ahead rests with leader @entity44 , who pressed ahead with the december rocket launch in defiance of the @entity23 sanctions			1
if it were to go ahead , this would be the first nuclear test under @entity44 , who took over the leadership after the death of his father @entity51 in december 2011			1
@entity2 has conducted two nuclear tests , in 2006 and 2009			0
@entity53 urged @entity2 not to proceed with a third test just as the @entity2 's statement was published on thursday			0
' whether @entity2 tests or not is up to @entity2 , ' @entity56 , the top @entity10 envoy for @entity2 diplomacy , said in the @entity40 capital of @entity60			2
' we hope they do n't do it			0
we call on them not to do it , ' @entity56 said after a meeting with @entity40 officials			0
' this is not a moment to increase tensions on the @entity71			0
' @entity10 special representative for @entity2 policy @entity56 after meeting with @entity40 's chief nuclear envoy @entity74 in @entity60 today @entity76 , the one major diplomatic ally of the isolated and impoverished @entity2 , agreed to the @entity10 - backed resolution and it also supported resolutions in 2006 and 2009 after @entity16 's two earlier nuclear tests			1
thursday 's statement by @entity2 represents a huge challenge to @entity82 as it undergoes a leadership transition with @entity84 due to take office in march			0
@entity76 's @entity86 called for calm and restraint and a return to six - party talks , but effectively singled out @entity2 , urging the ' relevant party ' not to take any steps that would raise tensions			2
' we hope the relevant party can remain calm and act and speak in a cautious and prudent way and not take any steps which may further worsen the situation , ' ministry spokesman @entity94 told reporters at a regular press briefing			0
@entity2 has rejected proposals to restart the talks aimed at reining in its nuclear capacity			2
the @entity10 , @entity76 , @entity104 , @entity105 and the two koreas are the six parties involved			1
' after all these years and numerous rounds of six - party talks we can see that @entity76 's influence over @entity2 is actually very limited , ' said @entity111 , an expert on @entity2 at @entity112 in @entity113			2
' all @entity76 can do is try to persuade them not to carry out their threats			1
' analysts said the @entity2 could test as early as february as @entity40 prepares to install a new , untested president or that it could choose to stage a nuclear explosion to coincide with former ruler @entity51 's february 16 birthday			1
@entity2 has been steadily enhancing its missile technology for years ' @entity2 will have felt betrayed by @entity76 for agreeing to the latest @entity23 resolution and they might be targeting ( @entity76 ) as well ( with this statement ) , ' said @entity125 , senior research fellow at @entity126 in @entity60			0
the @entity2 was banned from developing missile and nuclear technology under sanctions dating from its 2006 and 2009 nuclear tests			0
any nuclear tests would be the first under @entity2 leader @entity44 a @entity40 military official said the concern now is that @entity16 could undertake a third nuclear test using highly enriched uranium for the first time , opening a second path to a bomb			1
@entity2 's 2006 nuclear test using plutonium produced a puny yield equivalent to one kiloton of @entity145 - compared with 13 - 18 kilotons for the @entity149 bomb - and @entity10 intelligence estimates put the 2009 test 's yield at roughly two kilotons			1
@entity2 is estimated to have enough fissile material for about a dozen plutonium warheads , although estimates vary , and intelligence reports suggest that it has been enriching uranium to supplement that stock and give it a second path to the bomb			0
according to estimates from the @entity161 from late 2012 , @entity2 could have enough weapons grade uranium for 21 - 32 nuclear weapons by 2016 if it used one centrifuge at its @entity166 nuclear plant to enrich uranium to weapons grade			0
@entity2 gave no time - frame for the coming test and often employs harsh rhetoric in response to @entity23 and @entity10 actions that it sees as hostile			2
its long - range rockets are not seen as capable of reaching the @entity10 mainland and it is not believed to have the technology to mount a nuclear warhead on a long - range missile			2
the bellicose statement on thursday appeared to dent any remaining hopes that @entity44 , believed to be 30 years old , would pursue a different path from his father @entity51 , who oversaw the country 's military and nuclear programmes			0
' the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) resolution masterminded by the @entity10 has brought its hostile policy towards the @entity2 ( @entity2 ) to its most dangerous stage , ' the commission was quoted as saying			0

@entity191 says test and rocket launches aimed at the @entity10 , its ' sworn enemy '
@entity10 and @entity76 envoys urge @entity16 not to carry out third nuclear test
@entity199 could come as early as february , say analysts
