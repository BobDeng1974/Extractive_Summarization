a consumer watchdog has called for @entity1 to be placed under investigation after the airline cancelled direct flights from @entity5 to @entity6 with as little as 24 hours ' notice			1
the @entity9 - based airline had promoted their new route for months , promising to fly passengers directly from @entity5 to @entity6 after a december 26 launch			1
but furious @entity14 travellers had their holiday plans ruined when they were sent what they say was the ' the worst text ' on christmas day - cancelling their flights with just a day 's notice			1
@entity20 has written to the @entity21 to examine @entity1 's conduct , saying the airline sold tickets on a route it did not have permission to fly			1
' the fact is consumers purchased direct flights to @entity6 but they ended up being flown around the houses coming in via @entity9			1
@entity1 sold one thing and delivered something different - and in the process it misled consumers			0
' under consumer law , mr @entity39 says passengers should be compensated by the airline for their out - of - pocket expenses			0
' it is also highly likely that @entity1 's decision to cancel the direct flight resulted in consumers ' holiday plans being thrown into disarray with many incurring cancellation costs , ' he said			1
' if the route alteration had a major impact on holiday plans , where a holiday was the reason the flights were purchased , it constitutes a major failure under @entity68			0
' if the airline misled consumers or acted in a way that constitutes a " major failure " under consumer law , consumers should be able to seek compensation from the airline for any unexpected expenses they have had as a result of the cancellation			0
' @entity81 ( left ) was devastated that her daughter 's @entity6 wedding has been ' wrecked ' because her immediate family has been stranded by the flight change @entity81 took to @entity86 to express her anger and disappointment at the change and the way the airline conducted themselves passengers were sent out frantic texts on christmas day , informing them that flights from @entity96 onwards were not only cancelled , but their expected travel time on their new flights was now doubled from five - and - a - half hours to a lengthy 13 hours			1
weddings and travel plans went out the window when the commuters were informed they would have to stop over at @entity103 , meaning many travellers would arrive a day later than they had planned			0
' thank you for wrecking our family @entity109 and my daughters wedding ! ! my daughter is due to be married on the 28th dec 2014 in bali and my daughter in law is a bridsemade ( sic ) and my son is walking her down the isle ( sic )			0
' this was until you changed my daughter in laws and sons direct flight from the 27th dec 2014 to leave on the 28th dec with a stop over in kuala lumpur in which they will miss the whole wedding ! ! ' wrote @entity81			0
it all occurred due to an ' administration issue ' according to @entity1			0
rumours are flying , unlike the airline , that @entity1 is not authorised by air controllers to fly from @entity5 to @entity131			1
an @entity28 spokesman confirmed that ' an unforseen delay in the approval process for necessary documentation , ' was the reason for the delay			0
' @entity139 is working closely with all relevant authorities including the @entity141 and @entity142 ( @entity143 ) to ensure that the administration process can be completed as soon as possible , ' an @entity28 spokesman told @entity145			0
' @entity139 will commence the direct return flight from @entity131 to @entity5 as scheduled as soon as this process has been completed			2
passengers were put on new flights and had to change over at @entity103 airport ( pictured ) @entity151 ( left ) and @entity152 ( right ) were furious that their flights had been cancelled and that they received ' appalling customer service ' by writing messages on @entity86 travellers were enraged that the airline has been selling tickets for the flights since october , pledging to carry 377 passengers five times a week			1
the airasia facebook page was flooded with angry messages from jilted customers , complaining about the major gaffe			0
' you should n't have advertised / sold flights under the guise of them being available when they were n't			0
if you were n't allowed to fly direct from @entity5 â€“ @entity6 then why advertise that you can ? ' wrote @entity170			1
' i am keen to investigate under @entity21 as this surely is false advertising , ' added @entity173			2
' this morning ( @entity109 morning ) we got a phonecall from @entity1 saying that our flight to @entity6 which was scheduled to leave at 10:40 am on the 26th of dec ( tomorrow ) has been delayed to 05:00 pm and will fly thru @entity103 instead of being a direct flight			1
we were supposed to reach @entity6 at 01:00 pm but now we will reach 14 hours later at 03:00 am , ' explained @entity178			0
ms @entity152 was furious that her ' transfers and accommodation ' was going to waste and was concerned that she did not know what will happen with her return flight , which had promised to fly her straight from @entity6 to @entity5 with @entity1 @entity151 was concerned that he had not been contacted about whether or not his december 28 flight would be affected , despite the news that flights were indefinitely grounded ms @entity81 was devastated about the impact this decision has had on her daughter 's wedding , which was further exacerbated by the ' poor service ' they received from @entity1			1
she explained in her @entity86 page that that they were ' hung up on fifteen times ' while trying to change their flights , and then transferred to a call centre where they encountered a serious language barrier			1
' this service is beyond unacceptable and due to this my two kids will miss this very special day and they can not afford another $ 1700 each to change their flights ! ' ' the biggest issue is that it 's such short notice that all the other direct flights are more than $ 1000 direct , ' affected traveller @entity208 told @entity145			2
other customers were livid that @entity1 will not compensate the travellers for the prepaid accommodation , transfers and other activities which will be missed due to the last - minute change in their flights			2
an @entity28 spokesman confirmed that ' an unforseen delay in the approval process for necessary documentation , ' was the reason for the delay traveller @entity173 wrote a bitter message on @entity86 , sarcastically posting ' thanks for the @entity226 text ' on their @entity86 page , @entity1 sent messages to furious customers to apologise for the fiasco			1
' the re-route via @entity103 ( @entity103 ) is a temporary solution as we work with authorities in the coming days to overcome the issue , ' wrote @entity1 on @entity86 , not explaining to customers what exactly the ' issue ' is which has caused all flights to be cancelled			1
customers were not satisfied by @entity1 's response when they demanded to know how they would be compensated for the lost funds			0
' for any extra costs , we recommend you contact your travel insurance provider			0
this is a temporary issue , and we 're working with government agencies to be able to commence our direct services as soon as possible in the near future			0
' @entity151 was pro-active , asking @entity1 on @entity86 if they could give him slightly more notice if his december 28 flight was set to be re-routed			2
' any idea if the direct flight from @entity5 to @entity6 on the 28th departing at 10:40 will be re-routed as well ? thought i 'd be proactive and ask here first rather than wait for the news to be delivered by carrier pigeon 7 days after my flight			2
' @entity260 also missed a friend 's wedding and was angry that the airline does n't seem to care because they already had her ' hard earned money ' some travellers will arrive at @entity266 more than 24 hours than they had originally planned			2

@entity20 has written to the @entity21 to investigate @entity9 airline @entity1
@entity1 cancelled all direct flights from @entity5 to @entity6 just *12* hours before some of the scheduled flights
the direct route was planned to launch on december 26
it 's understood the airline did not have the required approval from @entity14 and @entity280 aviation authorities
travellers were sent texts about the cancellation on @entity109
furious *patrons* left complaints on @entity289 's @entity86 page
