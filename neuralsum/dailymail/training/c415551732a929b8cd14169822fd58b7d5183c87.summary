the case of @entity9 - who is charged with defection , abuse of power and bribe - taking - is being held behind closed doors amid tight security in @entity14 , the western @entity2 city to which he fled in february and handed over sensitive information about @entity4 ’s grisly death to @entity6 consulate officials			1
his dramatic flight for freedom lead to the downfall of powerful politician @entity23 and the conviction of @entity23 ’s wife , @entity25 , who was last month handed a suspended death sentence for poisoning 41 - year - old @entity4 over a business dispute			1
trial : @entity2 police chief @entity9 ( left ) , who exposed the murder of @entity5 businessman @entity4 ( right ) and then tried to defect to the @entity6 the scandal has thrown the ruling @entity31 ’s carefully choreographed once - in - decade power transition into disarray			1
' the hearing was closed according to @entity2 law because it involves state secrets			0
the trial has two parts , private and public			0
tuesday is the private part because it involves state secrets - it was about the two charges of defection and bending the law for his own ends , ” said @entity9 ’s lawyer , @entity47 , who declined to elaborate on case details			2
@entity9 , 52 , is the former mafia - busting cop and right hand man of popular party secretary @entity23			1
@entity9 's dramatic flight for freedom lead to the downfall of politician @entity23 and the conviction of @entity23 's wife , @entity25 , who was handed a suspended death sentence for poisoning 41 - year - old @entity4 the pair ruled with an iron fist over the western @entity2 mega city of @entity61 and enjoyed national fame together			1
but their relationship imploded late last year after the death of @entity4 and the erratic behaviour of @entity23 ’s wife @entity67 , who with the help of her orderly killed the @entity71 with a cyanide - laced drink following a business dispute			1
prosecutors in her trial claimed she conferred with @entity9 before murdering @entity4 and reported back to him afterwards			2
@entity9 then fled with details of the murder and pleaded for protection from the @entity6 after falling out with @entity23 earlier this year			2
but he was persuaded after 30 hours of what was fast becoming an embarrassing diplomatic dispute to hand himself over to @entity2 armed police who had surrounded the consulate			0
guards stand in a shop next to the @entity88 where the trial is being held behind closed doors amid tight security @entity5 officials have been criticised for not acting sooner on the information handed to them by the @entity6 about @entity9 ’s murder file			1
' we made every effort to establish whether additional information existed , ' a spokesman for the @entity97 said			0
what is certain is that @entity4 ’s murder would likely never have been investigated had @entity9 not fled to the @entity6 consulate and @entity23 would still be in line for a seat on @entity2 's most powerful political body , the standing committee of the @entity108			1
rumours : @entity2 's leader in waiting , @entity110 was not seen in public for two weeks earlier @entity2 state media reported the evidence against @entity9 was ' concrete and abundant ' , shorthand for his fate has already been decided by the government , which runs the country ’s courts			1
several other policemen accused in covering up @entity4 's murder have already been jailed for long sentences and defector @entity9 could face the death penalty if found guilty			1
his trial is a next step for @entity2 ’s leadership in its attempt to move past the scandal and deal with @entity23 , the revered son of a revolutionary veteran who has a web of political contacts and allies , including generals in the country ’s all - powerful military			2
but @entity2 ’s rulers appear divided over how to deal with him – he remains under house arrests - and the scandal ’s fallout continues to dog the leadership transition			0
a date for the party congress to install the new leadership has yet be announced , though it is expected to held in mid- to late october			0
many experts believe the infighting in some way explained the prolonged absence of leader in waiting , @entity110			0
@entity110 was not seen in public for two weeks and had cancelled high level meetings which sparked rumours about his health			0
the government refused to say why he was absent and he reappeared at the weekend			0
many believe he has been behind the scenes attempting to appease factions within the top echelons of the secretive government .			0
