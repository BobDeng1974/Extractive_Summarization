by @entity0 published : 12:10 est , 30 october 2013 updated : 21:31 est , 30 october 2013 if you ever wanted a definition of what ‘ aghast ’ looks like , here ’s a handy lesson courtesy of prince @entity6			1
the prince pulled the rather vivid facial expression as he mingled with guests at a @entity11 reception to honour members of the nursing profession			1
yet by rights , they should have been the ones looking shocked			0
because he had just told a group of respiratory nurses about his childhood vice – smoking behind a chicken coop when he was at school			1
quip : @entity6 talked about his youthful indiscretion while meeting award - winning respiratory nurses confession : prince @entity6 , pictured left today and right aged 11 , has admitted smoking as a schoolboy nurse and secondary school teacher @entity28 , 39 , from @entity30 said afterwards : ‘ there was a few of us that are respiratory nurses and he asked whether we deal with a lot of smokers			1
‘ he said , " i gave up at 11 when i had a few cigarettes behind a chicken coop			1
" ‘ i believe it was tongue in cheek			0
’ it ’s not the first time the prince had admitted to trying a crafty ciggie			0
in november 1998 he made the same confession to schoolchildren on an official visit to @entity49			2
prince @entity6 asked pupils at the @entity51 in @entity52 whether they had ever tried smoking - and about half of the 28 pupils taking part in the seminar with him said they had			1
event : @entity6 talks to cancer nurse @entity59 at the @entity60 held at @entity11 ‘ i gave up smoking at the age of 11 , ’ said prince @entity6			1
‘ i had one or two strong ones behind the chicken run at school			2
the good thing is to give them up when you are young			0
’ the @entity49 pupils , told what the prince had said by a translator , burst into laughter			0
@entity74 , 11 , said he had read that @entity76 president @entity75 had tried smoking marijuana			2
the prince replied : ‘ do n't believe everything you read in the newspapers			0
’ @entity6 would have been at @entity83 preparatory school in @entity84 at the time he was talking about			1
he hinted that in trying cigarettes he had bowed to peer pressure from his classmates			2
a spokesman at @entity11 declined to comment further today			1
but in previous years they have suggested that the prince ’s wife , the @entity90 , who was once rather a heavy smoker , has given up			0
tribute : the @entity6 wrote an article in @entity60 praising the contribution nurses make to public health in a q&a session on its website it says , ' q. are the reports that @entity102 is still a smoker true ? a : no. @entity102 of @entity104 gave up smoking many years ago			1
' however @entity6 's son , prince @entity105 , has long been an unapologetic smoker			1
the prince ’s remarks were made at a reception he hosted to pay tribute to the nominees of the @entity60 annual awards			1
@entity6 hailed the dedication and hard work of the nation 's nurses , saying they give ' exceptional care ' to patients across the country			1
writing in the @entity60 ahead of the magazine 's awards ceremony , he said he believed nurses ' care and kindness was ' vital ' and stressed the importance of a holistic approach to those who are sick			2
@entity6 , who is patron of more than 30 healthcare organisations , said his visits to hospitals over the past 40 years had shown him just how pivotal a role nurses play			1
recognition : the prince talking to @entity134 , nominated for outstanding continence care he wrote : ' in all these instances , together with many others , it was abundantly clear to me just how important the emotional connection between patients and skilled , hard - working nurses actually was			0
' in general , quite apart from the medical expertise that nursing staff provide on a daily and nightly basis , the reassurance and simple human kindness that they can also dispense is , i believe , vital and must surely impact positively on the recovery of individuals			0
' human kindness , reassurance and sympathy are age - old qualities , yet they are as important today as they have ever been			0
' the @entity60 recognise this , as well as the importance of a holistic approach - treating the whole person , rather than just the symptoms of disease			0
' when this approach is combined with the best of conventional medicine , and adopted by the whole healthcare team , with scrupulous attention to every aspect of the patient 's personal , medical and nursing needs , great progress can be made			0
' youngster : @entity6 is pictured in 1959 driving away from @entity83 school with his grandmother , mother and sister health campaigners said today that while they could not comment on the prince ’s remarks directly , the issue of children taking up smoking was one of deep concern			1
indeed , laws to allow the secretary of state powers to introduce standard packaging for tobacco products sold in places to which children have access are expected to be debated in the @entity191 next month			0
dr @entity192 , chief executive of the @entity193 , told the @entity194 that 80 per cent of smokers admitted starting in their teens			0
‘ it may be a number of years since prince @entity6 tried smoking as a child , but sadly children smoking is not just a concern of the past			2
indeed , more than 200,000 children in the @entity205 start smoking every year , ’ she said ‘ and while @entity207 may not have continued to smoke into adulthood , we know that many children do – in fact over 80 per cent of smokers started in their teens , with almost 40 per cent starting before the age of 16			0
‘ with parliament due to discuss the issue in the coming weeks , @entity6 ’ admission is a timely reminder that we still need to explore new initiatives for protecting children from the dangers of smoking			2
‘ measures such as introducing compulsory standardised packaging for all tobacco products will help prevent tobacco companies from marketing cigarettes to children , and cut the number of children taking up this deadly habit			0
