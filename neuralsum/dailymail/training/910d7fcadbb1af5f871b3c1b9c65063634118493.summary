by @entity0 for @entity1 a couple have been fined £ 120 for taking their son out of school to go on holiday with his terminally - ill grandfather			1
@entity8 and @entity9 asked for permission to take @entity11 , 13 , away for two weeks at the end of the summer term to go to @entity14 with grandfather @entity15			1
@entity16 allegedly said it was not a good enough reason , but the couple decided to go anyway as mr @entity20 is given allocated holiday dates and can not change them			1
mr @entity20 , a bus driver from @entity22 , said : ' my father - in - law is terminally ill and we wanted to go to @entity14 as he loves it out there and we wanted to have a family holiday with him			1
' punished : @entity28 and @entity20 were fined £ 120 for taking their 13 - year - old son @entity11 out of school to go on holiday to @entity14 with his terminally - ill grandfather			1
they were told the circumstances were ' not exceptional ' he added : ' i 've been fined and , fair enough , i 'll pay the fine , that does n't bother me , it is the principle			1
' they sent us a letter saying it is not a good enough reason , but what is a good reason ? ' i was told by someone if he was to die they would have allowed it , but if he had died we would not be going on a family holiday			2
' @entity11 is quite close to his nan and grandad			2
' they spoil him rotten and he is always doing something with them and it might have been his last holiday with his grandad			0
' i do n't think it is very fair			0
' it was all booked up and we were not going to lose all the money , so we decided to go and face the consequences afterwards			0
we got home and now @entity11 's grandad is quite poorly			2
' mr and mrs @entity9 received two letters charging them £ 60 each last week			0
denied : staff at @entity16 allegedly said the grandfather 's illness was not a good enough reason , but the couple decided to go anyway as mr @entity20 is given allocated holiday dates he can not change no one from the school was available to comment			1
a @entity73 spokesman said the decision about whether a case meets the exceptional circumstances requirement is taken by the headteacher			0
he would not comment on whether this case should have met that criteria			0
headteachers no longer have the discretion to approve absences of up to 10 days a year for family holidays in ' special circumstances ' because of new rules introduced in september 2013			0
tougher criteria of ' exceptional circumstances ' restrict approved absences to events such as family funerals .			0

@entity20 wanted @entity11 to spend a last holiday with grandfather in @entity14
school staff said it was not a valid reason , so family went anyway
@entity101 said £ 120 fine does n't bother him , but ' it is the principle '
