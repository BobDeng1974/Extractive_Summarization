it was originally alleged in a magazine article by @entity8 that the prince , who had just arrived at the base in his role as an @entity12 helicopter pilot , was rushed to a ' safe house ' for his protection during the attack			1
the @entity16 later denied the claims , saying he had been ' treated much the same as any [ other ] service member deployed to @entity4 '			1
slumber : prince @entity2 , pictured while in @entity21 above , allegedly slept through an attack on @entity4 which left two dead and 16 other injured but newly released @entity24 military files that were previously marked ' secret ' reveal that the young royal , alongside other soldiers , slept through the attack			1

' on duty : @entity2 , pictured at the camp above , was stationed in @entity21 for three months as an @entity34 he also reiterated that the royal was treated like any other serviceman while at the base , and the only special treatment he received was ' a place identified as a safe house in case the base came under attack			2
' today , both the @entity16 and @entity44 declined to comment on the revelations , published in the @entity46			1
sources close to the @entity2 today , however , suggested he was aware that an attack had taken place			2

the young royal is currently on tour in @entity76 , representing the @entity77 on his first official visit to the country			0

devastation : during the @entity87 , pictured , @entity86 claimed that prince @entity2 was never in any danger secret papers the newspaper say they have seen reveal the @entity16 refused to pay for a fence to protect the airfield despite a recommendation by @entity71 officers ’ in march 2012			1
the recommendation was made after an attempted suicide attack on the runway where a plane carrying the @entity24 defence secretary @entity98 had just landed			1
one of the papers , a review by the @entity101 ( @entity101 ) , reads : ' a statement of requirements ( @entity104 ) was generated to request the preferred course of action : the installation of an airfield perimeter fence ... this @entity104 was initially sent through @entity71 chain of command for approval ; however , it was denied on the basis of cost [ vs ] security gains			1
' in another document , a senior @entity24 officer , whose name is redacted , states : ' every airfield that i ’ve ever been [ to ] has a fence around to help protect it			2
' the officer goes on to say that the ease with which the base was penetrated was correlated to @entity71 's inability to finance the fence			0

withdrawal : @entity180 , in the @entity179 - e @entity178 district , @entity176 , are preparing to return to the @entity71 ' the @entity24 review was intended to examine @entity24 actions only and not those of coalition forces			2
however , the @entity71 will consider the findings of this review to confirm our earlier assessment that no further @entity71 action is required			0
' it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time			0
” but colonel @entity191 , a former commander of @entity71 forces in @entity21 , said that @entity71 must accept responsibility for failing to protect the base			0
