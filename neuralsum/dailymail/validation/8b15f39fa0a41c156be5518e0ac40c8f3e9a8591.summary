two polls showed the parties deadlocked with 27 seats each , while a third gave @entity8 a slight lead of 28 - 27			1
but all showed the centrist newcomer @entity64 with enough seats to determine who will be the next prime minister			1
@entity64 , a @entity8 breakaway , has not said which side he would favour - but is likely to drive a hard bargain			2
they also seemed to suggest that @entity0 appears to have the slight upper hand in forming a majority coalition , thanks to his traditional right - wing and religious allies			1
@entity3 supporters of the centre - left @entity78 wave their national flag as they take part in early celebrations outside the party 's headquarters			1

it also appears @entity0 has the slight upper hand in forming a coalition the @entity0 supporters cheered as they heard the first television predictions for the election results ' this is a great victory			1
it 's almost a miracle , ' @entity8 lawmaker @entity106 told @entity108			0
' for months , everybody attacked the @entity8			0
and today is a beautiful day for the @entity8			0
it sends a message that the people of @entity3 will decide for themselves			0
' the early figures set off huge celebrations at the @entity8 campaign headquarters in @entity44			2
but the mixed results are sure to disappoint @entity41 , who had been tipped to come out on top in the election			1

the parties will all fall short of the required 61 - seat majority in parliament			0
the early results , which will be confirmed on wednesday , triggered huge celebrations at the @entity8 's campaign headquarters in @entity44 @entity8 supporters celebrate as @entity0 declares a ' great victory ' for the party and for @entity3 ( left and right ) @entity8 supporters react joyously after hearing exit poll results in @entity44 this morning supporters of @entity0 celebrate as election results come in at his campaign headquarters @entity3 is divided between two major groups of voters - right wingers and religious parties that tend to take a hard line toward the @entity143 , and parties focused on establishing a @entity143 state as part of a peace agreement			1
the left wing appeared to have slightly more seats , but would rely heavily on a new @entity151 list that has said it will not sit in a coalition			0
that gives @entity0 , who his seeking his third consecutive term , and his traditional right - wing allies a slight head - start in the negotiations			1
experts agreed that the vote had largely seen as a referendum on @entity0			0
final opinion polls published late last week put @entity41 ahead with 25 - 26 seats with @entity0 's @entity8 taking 20 - 22			1
but they also warned about the reliability of the polls , pointing to the 2013 election when they completely failed to predict the level of support for centrist newcomer @entity171			0
@entity41 ( second left ) , pictured with his wife @entity174 after casting their votes , had been tipped to come out on top in the election @entity64 , @entity179 party leader , greets his supporters in @entity44			1
the upstart centrist @entity179 party has emerged as the kingmaker in the elections , and could tip the scale in favor of either @entity0 or @entity41 a @entity13 party supporters raises his hand to his face in disappointment			2
whoever wins will fall short of the required 61 - seat majority in parliament and will have to rely on allies to form a coalition supporters of @entity64 's party @entity179 celebrate after the exit polls were announced			2
the party has enough seats to decide who will be the next prime minister - but is likely to drive a hard bargain this election season has amplified the bitter divide between hard - liners and moderates in @entity3			2
in an extraordinary attempt to sway right - wing voters , @entity0 announced on the eve of the election that there would be no @entity143 state if he were re-elected			2
as his party trailed the @entity13 in final opinion polls , @entity0 said that if his rivals were elected security would be compromised and they would give up total @entity3 control over @entity219			2
' we will continue to build to fortify @entity219 so its division will not be possible and it will remain united forever , ' he said on a tour of @entity224 , a settlement neighbourhood of annexed east @entity219			0
the outgoing @entity3 parliament and the latest opinion poll @entity0 also vowed he would never allow the @entity143 to establish a capital in the city 's eastern sector and pledged to build ' thousands ' of settler homes			0
the @entity143 want east @entity219 as capital of their future state , and continued settlement building has incensed the international community , which sees it as an obstacle to peace			0
throughout his campaign , @entity0 has repeatedly accused @entity13 leaders @entity41 and former peace negotiator @entity241 of being ready to abandon @entity3 's claim to @entity219 as its indivisible capital			2
but @entity0 's most strident statement came when he was asked by the rightwing @entity246 website if it was true that there would be no @entity143 state established if he was reelected			0
he later told public radio the two - state solution was now irrelevant , saying the ' reality has changed ' and ' any territory which would be handed over would be taken over by radical @entity253 '			0
@entity41 , however , dismissed @entity0 's jibes , pledging on sunday to ' safeguard ' @entity219 ' in actions , not just words , more than any other leader '			2
on monday , he insisted @entity219 would remain forever @entity3 's ' undivided capital '			0
the leader of the party which secures most votes does not necessarily become the next premier -- as in 2009 when the centrist @entity260 then headed by @entity241 effectively won the vote but lost the election in a race which brought @entity0 to power for a second term			0
under @entity3 's complex electoral system , the task of forming a government does not automatically fall to the party with the largest number of votes , but to the mp or party leader with the best chance of cobbling together a coalition with a parliamentary majority of 61 .			0
