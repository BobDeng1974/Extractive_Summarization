@entity0 has hinted the first chapter of his county comeback could be streamed live to fans			2
the divisive batsman has re-signed for @entity5 this summer in an attempt to win an unlikely @entity8 recall , having been thrown an apparent lifeline by incoming @entity11 chairman @entity10			1
he has not played in the @entity12 since 2013 but is set to start the season with the @entity14 in the hope of turning the selectors ' heads and reversing last year 's controversial sacking			0
@entity0 will step up his attempts to earn an @entity8 recall when he starts batting on monday the 34 - year - old @entity0 wants to end his @entity8 absence that started after the 2013 - 14 ashes whitewash @entity0 ( right ) rejoined @entity5 after incoming @entity11 chairman @entity10 said domestic form would help the 34 - year - old has indicated that his campaign will start with a three - day warm - up against @entity27 on april 12 and he is due to return to the nets on monday			1
@entity0 announced that to his 2.3 million @entity30 followers on @entity31 , raising the prospect of using the social network 's new broadcast app , periscope , to showcase his session in real time			1
he wrote : ' starting to bat tomorrow ... might @ periscopeco it , so all of you can watch it live & see how i get on			0
should i ? # comeback '			0
quite how @entity0 's ' # comeback ' will pan out in the long term is unclear			2
he clearly feels @entity10 ' words are encouragement enough of a @entity48 recall but after so many bitter recriminations - and one dazzlingly indiscreet autobiography - there are still many bridges to build			0
his decision to hit the county trail , so long a bete noire in his career , at least offers the platform for him to nudge both selectorial and public opinion from close quarters			0
but when @entity8 flew to the @entity61 on thursday ahead of the forthcoming @entity48 series , the messages were thoroughly mixed			0
captain @entity63 , who was not given a glittering write - up in the @entity0 's book , largely absolved himself from the decision - making process , insisting it would be taken by @entity10 , managing director of @entity8 cricket @entity68 and chief executive @entity70			2
coach @entity71 was less ambiguous			1
@entity71 was sacked from his first stint in charge in 2008 , partially at the behest of @entity0 , whose intervention also cost him the captaincy			2
incoming @entity11 chairman @entity10 advised that signing for a domestic side would help @entity0 's cause @entity63 ( left ) was coy on @entity0 's chances of a recall but @entity71 said he ' is n't on the radar ' @entity71 was previously dismissed as @entity8 coach at the behest of @entity0 when he was captain he was then belittled as a nagging ' woodpecker ' in the the batsman 's memoir and reconciliation between the two men would appear a stretch			1
asked at @entity91 about the situation , @entity71 said : ' from my point of view , @entity0 is n't on the radar			1
' he would , therefore , seem an unlikely viewer of @entity0 's @entity99 net session .			0
