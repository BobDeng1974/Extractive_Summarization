by @entity0 if any of you guys watch made in @entity3 , you 'll know i 've got an exciting adventure on the horizon			1
i 'm heading off to stateside for a couple of months - we 're taking mic to @entity10 , so watch out @entity11 ! a bunch of my best buddies from the show are coming along ( and , yes , some of my not - so - favourite friends , too )			1
it 's going to be an amazing trip , but i 'm such a homegirl that i know i 'll miss the mates i 've left behind			2
so me and my girl gang have booked a last - minute weekend away			2
we 're heading off to the countryside for two days of pampering , gossip and giggles			1
i 've gathered up my perfect weekend beauty kit			1
i 'm not taking tons of lotions and potions - just my favourite selection of tried - and - tested travel products that keep me gorgeous on the go			1
essential oils can work wonders , calming your nerves , boosting your energy after a long journey or soothing you off to sleep			2
this triple - pack of roll - on oils is a travel must - have for me - especially @entity54 : a quick dab on my pulse points and i 'm straight off to the land of nod			0
@entity60 - @entity59 and @entity61 i give my hair a pretty hard time - constant styling , over-heating and extensions can leave my crowning glory looking less than glorious			0
this twin pack of products is the perfect solution			1
together , the shampoo and conditioner will condition and nourish your hair , improving and maintaining its health to give it a renewed shine and bounce			0
@entity0 recommends a little aromatherapy after a long day traveling and some high quality hair repair for damaged locks @entity82 - @entity81 this is a @entity0 must - have			1
i 'm always on the go and i do n't always have time for a wash and blow dry , so if my locks begin to look limp over the weekend , i 'll spritz in this miracle - worker and my hair will be transformed from flat and greasy to bouncy and gorgeous in seconds			0
@entity91 i plan on really looking after my complexion this weekend , and that means thoroughly removing every last scrap of make - up each night			0
that said , i do n't want to bring loads of lotions and potions away with me			0
luckily , these brilliant cleansing pads swipe away all traces of eye make - up ( including troublesome mascara ) in a flash			0
@entity106 's eye make - up remover pads are very handy for light packing and @entity0 's nail polish adds a great pop of colour to a weekend look @entity113 in @entity114 ok - i know this is one of my nail products so i 'm bound to be biased , but it looks so amazing , i 've been wearing non-stop recently			1
it 's made with a high - end gel base that utilises the best in nail lacquer technology , giving you fabulously glossy results			0
like all the @entity113 products , it 's also free from chemical nasties such as @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 , so your nails will be both beautiful and healthy too			1
@entity132 what 's the point in having beautiful nails if your hands look dry and dreadful ? ! this award - winning hand cream really deserves it 's reputation as an iconic skin saver			0
its super-smoothing 20 % concentration of shea butter cocoons hands in moisture , while antioxidant @entity145 ensures your skin is protected from ageing free radicals			0
it smells yummy too ! @entity0 loves the fresh summery fragrance of @entity152 's @entity151 and says @entity132 's hand cream is a skin savior @entity156 - @entity155 so @entity157 a summer getaway calls for a fresh summery fragrance , and the do n't come any lovelier than this one			1
it 's vibrant fruity mix of blood orange , raspberry , apricot and amber lifts your spirits and leaves you smelling good enough to eat			2
skinbreeze – under @entity170 i always reach for this serum to pick me up when i ’ve had a bit of a late night – it works wonders in reducing puffiness and dark circles around the eyes			0
a must have if you plan on partying over the weekend ! as always , i 've tested every product i mention , and you can pick up my recommendations at online beauty boutique escentual.com			2
@entity0 says that the @entity186 diamond pieces will look great against tanned summer skin on a more luxurious note , i recently got some gorgeous diamond jewellery from @entity190 on the recommendation of my friend @entity192 , @entity194 ’s resident diamond expert			1
the glitzy @entity195 will be adorning my neck on many a night out this summer , while the @entity195 and @entity197 in 9 - carat @entity198 will look stunning against tanned fingers - a real timeless piece			0
visit @entity201 if you ’re after a touch of luxe but do n't want to spend a fortune , as a lot of the pieces are surprisingly affordable given their quality			0
diamonds are , after all , a girl 's best friend ... got to rush - my bags are packed , the taxi 's outside and the girls are waiting			2
so have a great bank holiday - i know i will ! and always stay gorgeous ! love @entity0 !			1
