high - stakes slot machines where gamblers can place bets of up to £ 100 are a form of ' onanism ' compared to the ' full sexual intercourse ' of betting on horses , a @entity1 peer has claimed			1
lord @entity9 mocked users of so - called @entity11 as ' sad - eyed blokes ' who sit in front of ' porn - like ' machines while ' shoving in pounds for momentary pleasure '			1
the extraordinary remarks came in a @entity18 debate on banning the machines , and sparked claims from a minister that he was turning the subject into ' @entity23 '			1
@entity9 compared betting on racing to the ' momentary pleasure ' of using high stakes betting machines the spread of the machines has sparked alarm among campaigners who warn they are fuelling problem gambling and anti-social behaviour			1
there are thought to be more than 30,000 @entity11 machines in the @entity35			2
the machines , which feature games such as roulette , blackjack and poker , have a maximum payout of up to £ 500			0
users can bet up to £ 100 every 20 seconds and in 2013 , some £ 1.6 billion was lost by gamblers on @entity44 in @entity35			0
in a debate in the @entity18 , several peers called for a crackdown on their use including capping the amount users can bet			0
but in his speech @entity9 launched into what he described as a ' rather racy analogy ' to describe how he is ' not very fond ' of the gambling machines			1
' if betting on a horse race is the full sexual intercourse of betting and gambling , with foreplay when you select your horse and mounting excitement as the race goes on - we know what happens after that , when the result comes - then @entity54 are a form of onanism			1
' you see sad - eyed blokes - it is always blokes - in front of porn - like machines , made very glittery and unrealistic , shoving in pounds for momentary pleasure			1
' he went on : ' if @entity44 evaporated into the air tomorrow , i for one should be delighted but that does not mean that i would ban them			0
' there are a lot of pastimes that i do not much like : fox hunting , shooting and fishing			0
' however , if others wish to practise them within the law - and of course on fox hunting there is a strict law - that is their affair			0
' foxed odds betting machines , which feature games such as roulette , blackjack and poker , have a maximum payout of up to £ 500 @entity103 frontbencher @entity102 of @entity104 later joked his ' contribution seemed to turn into ' @entity106 of @entity107 '			2
councils are among those calling for tough new powers to tackle ' clustering ' of betting shops and reduce the risks from @entity44 which have been dubbed the ' crack cocaine ' of gambling			1
they say the current £ 100 - a - spin maximum stake should be brought in line with maximum stakes for other gambling machines , which is £ 2 in pubs and £ 5 in casinos			2
@entity9 insisted that everything must be done to ' stop the terrible affliction that genuine addictive problem gambling can do to people and their families '			2
he added : ' as far as i am concerned , it is not those who shove every penny they can get hold of into these damned machines who are the only people with a gambling problem			0
' anyone who stuffs a hard - earned £ 100 into a slot has a gambling problem			0
you therefore have to tackle it across the board			0
