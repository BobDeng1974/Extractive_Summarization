the couple , known only as @entity17 and mrs p , allegedly groped the middle - aged woman and tried to perform a sex act on her as they sat drinking wine on a warm summer ’s evening			1
the pair giggled as their ‘ humiliated and scared ’ employee fled from their advances and barricaded herself in her bedroom , the employment tribunal heard			2
a few weeks after the alleged assault the woman was abruptly told to leave the house , she alleged			1
the mp gave her £ 300 cash and a letter claiming they had discussed disciplinary proceedings and that a severance deal would be drawn up , the hearing was told			1
the @entity39 tribunal heard the housekeeper was invited to live in the mp ’s house as a ‘ guest ’ in the spring of 2012 after breaking up with her civil partner			1
she said in august last year she was in the staff kitchen when mrs p invited her to join her and her husband in their sitting room , which she reluctantly agreed to			2
she told the tribunal that as she sat on the sofa the mp came and sat close to her			1
she said : ‘ mrs p then came and sat on the floor between his legs			0
' i felt very uncomfortable with mr p sitting so close to me and opted to sit on the edge of the sofa			2
‘ following a short conversation , mrs p placed her drink on a tray and began to @entity60 mr p who was sat next to me			2
‘ i was extremely embarrassed and looked away … as i really did not know what to do			0
i hoped they would soon stop			0
‘ instead , i felt a hand touch me in my crotch … i was wearing jeans			2
@entity67 : the housekeeper is claiming for sex discrimination and unfair dismissal after the @entity5 mp allegedly told her weeks after the alleged assault that she had an hour to leave the house ‘ i was extremely shocked and jumped at the feel of the hand and saw it was mrs p ’s hand			1
i shot back into the back of the sofa and as soon as i ’d done this , mr @entity79 then proceeded to place his hand on the top of my thigh			1
‘ i was very shocked and scared by what was happening and shot to my feet			0
i said , “ i ’m sorry , i ’m not into this sort of thing ” and i quickly left the room			2
’ she continued : ‘ as i left , i could hear mrs p giggling			0
they both clearly thought it very funny but i was extremely upset and scared and went directly into my room and i barricaded my door			1
’ the mp in the tribunal yesterday denied he would ‘ pop out naked ’ around his home in front of the housekeeper			1
mr @entity100 described himself as a ‘ courteous gentleman ’ who would never behave that way			2
his assertion came after his housekeeper told the hearing he would often appear about the house without clothes			1
she said : ‘ this happened on a number of times to the extent i did not think it could possibly be accidental			0
’ she said she spoke to mrs p about it , but she was ‘ dismissive ’ and mr @entity79 continued to appear naked in front of her			0
she added : ‘ i ’d be extremely embarrassed and would apologise for being there and would walk away immediately			0
’ the housekeeper claimed mrs p would also often undress in her presence when she was cleaning the bedrooms			0
but mr @entity100 told the tribunal : ‘ i have never behaved like that in front of anyone … i would never come out of the shower naked			1
i would always have a towel around my waist if i was not wearing shorts or such like			0
‘ i did not just pop out naked in front of her			0
’ he also told the hearing that he understood that the housekeeper liked to sunbathe naked			2
her bosses went on holiday early the day after the alleged incident and when she next saw mrs p over a fortnight later she asked to see her alone in the kitchen			0
the housekeeper told the hearing : ‘ she said she did not wish to talk about what had happened and asked me not to speak to anyone else about the incident			1
‘ she also asked that i did not “ let her down ”			0
i assumed by this request that if i did not speak of the incident again , then my position would be safe			0
’ she continued : ‘ mrs p did not ask me how i was feeling about the incident or indeed make any apology or attempt to remedy the situation			0
’ but a few weeks after the alleged assault , the housekeeper claims mr @entity100 told her she had an hour to leave , citing a series of fallings out that she had had with other members of their staff , the tribunal heard			1
she said he gave her £ 300 and a letter falsely claiming they had discussed disciplinary proceedings and that a severance deal would be drawn up			0
the housekeeper also claimed she was offered £ 5,000 to ‘ waive her right ’ to take the matter to an employment tribunal , which she says she declined			2
she is claiming sexual discrimination , unfair dismissal and wrongful dismissal			1
she told the tribunal : ‘ the harassment and dismissal from my position and my eviction have caused me significant problems including distress , anxiety and depression			1
i felt considerably low and considered suicide as life did not seem worth living			0
’ the mp and his wife strenuously denied the allegations , calling them ‘ wholly untrue and ridiculous ’ and accusing the woman of attempting to extort money from them			1
mr @entity100 said : ‘ it is a complete fabrication from start to finish			1
i can never remember asking the claimant into our tv room , sitting down with her , or having a drink with her			2
