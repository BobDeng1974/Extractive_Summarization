by the time @entity1 sang to a packed - out @entity3 at last night ’s closing ceremony , @entity0 had left			1
he was vaguely en route to his next glitzy assignment : a run on @entity8			1
there is no criticism intended in that observation			1
but however pleased we were that @entity14 ’s superman had called in , sprinkling his particular brand of stardust , he was not the only reason why the 20th staging of the @entity19 was a success			1
no , @entity21 2014 will live in the memory - if readers north of the border will forgive me - for its @entity27 fervour			1
look at the depth and spirit of the crowds as the @entity43 snaked its way through @entity45 last month			1
stadiums were largely full , even for heats			1
the weather , which began scorchingly hot but turned depressingly wet , was barely a deterrent			2
yesterday in near - apocalyptic conditions , folk huddled under umbrellas and banged the hoardings as a fabulous cycling road race unfolded			2
the usual debate every four years is whether this funny amalgam of countries and territories thrown up by a shared history can gather to play games together for much longer			2
that is a question that has faded here over 11 days of sport , and that is a significant tribute to what @entity21 has done			2
how different from when the last time the @entity19 came to @entity68 , in @entity69 in 1986			1
thirty - two @entity71 and @entity72 countries stayed away in protest at @entity35 ’s links with @entity75			2
in 1986 , the stars were @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83			2
was the 2014 roster up to snuff by comparison ? big shoes to fill : can the class of 2014 replicate the success of the likes of @entity82 ( pictured ) and @entity77 we can not yet be entirely sure			2
that depends who trains on , but in many spheres the competition was strong ( there are two billion people in the @entity19 ) , if not uniformly on the track			1
the withdrawal of @entity99 through illness was a major blow to the credibility of the athletics programme			2
the absence of @entity106 and the pretender to her throne , @entity104 was another			2
however , we were still treated to several good races and a wonderful men ’s 800m between the two outstanding performers in the world , @entity113 of @entity114 , the @entity116 champion and world record holder , and @entity119 ’s @entity118 , who ran him down			1
still , @entity113 came out with credit , such was the grace with which he took defeat			1
the @entity0 show was fun as far as it went			1
he only ran in the 4x100m relay , but everyone who was in @entity3 on those two nights will , when husky - voiced , tell their grandchildren they saw the great man in the flesh			0
big moment : spectators crammed in @entity3 to watch the @entity14 relay team win gold at the @entity19 @entity136 see out ' outstanding ' @entity19 on the subject of @entity3 , what a triumph it was as an athletics track			1
it housed 44,000 people after a conversion that cost £ 14million			0
a serious question : do we need to spend so much money building white - elephant stadiums around the world when we could adopt the @entity3 model ? there are other fine memories from these games			0
all 4ft 6in of little @entity154 @entity153 announcing herself as the heir to @entity156			0
her splendid floor routines made her the first @entity45 woman - she is 16 - to win four gold medals at one games since @entity161 in the first in 1930			0
@entity163 ran cleanly to take a fine silver medal behind the statuesque @entity14 @entity165			0
that augurs well for @entity167			0
other @entity45 talents to emerge were @entity169 , a 15 - year - old table tennis player , @entity171 - @entity170 , an 18 - year - old swimmer , and @entity173 , a 14 - year - old diver			0
for @entity45 , the @entity19 were a triumph			1
with 174 medals , including 58 golds , @entity45 surpassed @entity177 for the first time since @entity69 28 years ago			0
@entity68 , importantly as hosts , had their most successful games : 53 medals , including 19 golds			0
@entity183 , with 36 in all , five of them gold			0
spectacular send off : @entity21 waved goodbye to the @entity19 with an incredible closing ceremony at @entity3 on sunday evening let us not forget the little heroes who make the @entity190 what they are			1
did anyone represent this spirit of these games better than the crowd who roared @entity196 , of the @entity197 , on his final three laps of the 5,000m because he was running slower than a drunk coming out of a @entity202 pub ? the saddest moment of the @entity19 came from weightlifting , where a @entity206 girl of just 16 tested positive for diuretics and masking agents			1
it is no exaggeration to call it a form of child abuse			0
but at @entity3 last night we celebrated all that is best about these games			0
next stop four years from now , the @entity213			0
it was almost all over when the little lady sang			0
it was fun while it lasted			0
video @entity21 a ' stand - out games ' - @entity218			0

@entity0 was not the only one to steal the show at the @entity19
athletes such as @entity113 and @entity118 also *impressed*
the @entity19 came to an end on sunday evening
