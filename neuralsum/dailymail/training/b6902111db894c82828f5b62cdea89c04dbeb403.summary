the wait is almost over			1
and to celebrate @entity3 's imminent arrival , @entity1 have released a brand new blacklist gameplay trailer			1
the video shows off the different approaches @entity3 can use during missions			1
ghost focuses on stealth , with the aim of completing objectives without being seen			1
panther style allows @entity3 to stalk his enemies and unleash fatal finishing moves			1
while @entity15 ditches the silenced weapons and focuses on an all - out attack			2
in this latter approach , expect the modified mark and execute mechanic - killing in motion - to play a central role			2
he 's nearly here ! it 's felt like years but @entity3 is closing in on what could be his last outing on current gen blacklist follows on from the events of @entity29			2
the president shuts down the corrupt @entity31 , replacing it with @entity33 - led by @entity3			1
the team is then tasked with stopping a group of terrorist called ' the engineers ' attacking the @entity38			0
it 's powered by a heavily modified version of the @entity42 2.5 engine - the same one used in @entity29			0
however , although its visuals did n't stand out at this year 's @entity46 , they are noticeably smoother than in its predecessor , with animation - in particular - much improved			0
not surprisingly , the pc version was the strongest - with @entity52 's latest 700 series cards making short work of the dated engine			0
@entity56 owners can opt for @entity58 functionality - with players able to make a noise to distract guards or control @entity3 with body movements rather than a controller			0
the @entity65 version uses the touchscreen as an inventory and @entity68 ( @entity3 's arm - mounted computer ) as well as presenting thermal vision and motion tracking intel			0
now watch the latest trailer : let us know what you think on @entity76 : @ @entity77 and on @entity78 : @entity79 .			0
