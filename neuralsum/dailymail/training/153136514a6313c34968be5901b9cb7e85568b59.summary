by @entity0 after six years on the red planet , @entity2 's @entity1 has collected its fair share of dust			1
in fact , the red planet has thrown up so much that the solar panels on the rover were not working as well as they should			1
however , @entity2 has revealed the rover has has a spring clean - courtesy of the martian wind			2
before : this image of @entity1 in january 2014 shows its solar panels coated in a think layer of dust , obscuring its panels opportunity landed on @entity18 in 2004 in what was to be a three - month mission			1
instead the rover has lived beyond its prime mission and roved the planet for nearly 10 years			0
during its time on @entity18 , the rover has identified rock laden with what scientists believed to be clay minerals			0
their presence is an indication that the rock has been altered at some point in the past through prolonged contact with water			0
@entity2 today revealed these amazing pictures showing the rover 's cleanup			1
' it now has cleaner solar arrays than in any @entity18 winter since its first on the @entity18 , in 2005 , ' @entity2 said			0
' cleaning effects of wind events in march boosted the amount of electricity available for the rover 's work			1
' trhe two images show the rover in its ' dirty ' state in january 2014 ( above ) , where the panels have a thick layer of dust			2
the ' clean ' picture below , taken in march , reveals a sparking set of panels with their full capability restored			0
the mission is using the rover 's added energy to inspect ' @entity61 , ' on the western rim of @entity63 , to learn about wet environments on ancient @entity18 , @entity2 said			1
during @entity1 's first decade on @entity18 and the 2004 - 2010 career of its twin , @entity68 , @entity2 's @entity65 yielded a range of findings proving wet environmental conditions on ancient @entity18 -- some very acidic , others milder and more conducive to supporting life			0
after : in its sixth @entity18 winter , @entity2 's @entity1 now has cleaner solar arrays than in any @entity18 winter since its first on the @entity18 , in 2005			2
this false colour image of the roveron the @entity18 surface in its ' clean ' state shows just how well the wind cleared the panels of dust			0

@entity2 revealed that high winds on the red planet have cleaned to rover 's solar panels
pictures taken in january and march show the change
