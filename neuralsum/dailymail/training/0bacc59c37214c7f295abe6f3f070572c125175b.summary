by @entity1 reporter published : 12:15 est , 7 october 2013 updated : 16:48 est , 7 october 2013 @entity2 and @entity3 were n't even trying to get pregnant when they defied extreme genetic odds and conceived identical triplets without any help from fertility specialists			1
now the couple have just brought their identical daughters home from the hospital after being watched for more than three months after their delivery			2
there is a one in 8,000 chance of conceiving triplets naturally , and the while chances of identical triplets get even more slim and range from 1 - in - 60,000 to 1 - in - 2,000,000			1
when two separate eggs are fertilized during the same cycle , the children are fraternal twins while identical twins are produced when one egg splits into two embryos meaning that the two children would share genetic material			2
triplets are more of a rarity , and can be the result of a variety of combinations			2
two eggs can produce the twins as one would be fertilized on its own while the other splits into two , meaning that the threesome comes from one pair of twins and one individual embryo			0
the process of conceiving identical triplets comes from when one egg is used for all three , so the one egg splits into two embryos , and then one of those embryos splits again to produce the third child			1
