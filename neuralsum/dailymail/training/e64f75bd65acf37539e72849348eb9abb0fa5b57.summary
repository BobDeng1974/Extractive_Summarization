the hostility between the two teams is no secret with @entity3 falling out with the @entity22 club on several occasions , most notably when they were both bidding to move into the @entity24			2
@entity10 deadline day move to @entity7 collapsed after talks stalled @entity7 had been keen to take @entity10 to @entity28 @entity29 took to @entity11 to document his club ’s bid to sign @entity5 striker @entity10 in the closing hours of the january transfer window			1
‘ do n’t go to bed , ’ he urged , suggesting a deal was imminent			2
however he later took to the social network to apologise for giving supporters false hope			0
‘ sorry for keeping you up late , ’ he wrote , ‘ but at the last moment the main deal collapsed and the rest folded like a pack of cards			0
‘ i 'd like to thank @entity44 and @entity45 ( @entity46 , manager ) for their efforts to secure new players during this window			0
however no matter how hard you tried there are people out there that you just ca n't do business with			0
’ spurs are now left with a player in the dressing room they desperately wanted to get rid of until the summer , at least			0
@entity10 , 30 , is paid £ 100,000 a week			1
he refused to move away from @entity22 and @entity3 was willing to subsidise his wages if he moved to @entity61 , who offered to pay £ 60,000 - a - week towards his pay packet and @entity64 , who offered to contribute £ 70,000 - a - week			2
@entity0 was left frustrated by his attempts to sign @entity10 form @entity5 @entity5 chairman @entity3 was unwilling to subsidies @entity10 's wages if he moved to @entity7 @entity10 preferred a move to @entity7 but @entity3 would not budge , refusing to contribute any of his wages if he moved to @entity28			1
in some ways , this could be seen as a compliment to @entity7 , a club @entity3 clearly deems a threat to @entity5 ’ top four aspirations			1
there are just six points separating them in the @entity79 table and @entity80 born @entity3 , 52 , did n’t want to be left rueing the sale of @entity10			1
but @entity82 seemed to take it somewhat personally			0
@entity84 played for @entity7 before leaving in 2004 to join @entity5 spurs have bought some of @entity7 ’s best players in recent years , including @entity88 and @entity89			1
but there is no love lost between @entity3 and @entity7 ’s vice-chairman @entity92 , either			1
the pair made their war of words public in 2011 when they were both bidding to take over the @entity24 , which was later sold to @entity7			1
in a statement , @entity3 branded @entity100 a ‘ scaremonger ’ and accused her of being ‘ irresponsible ’ after she said his club ’s plans to tear down the stadium in @entity106 amounted to ‘ corporate crime ’			0
@entity89 was another player who started at @entity7 and was later signed by @entity5 @entity100 had accused @entity3 of making rash plans to redevelop the site			1
‘ it ’s a corporate crime to spend £ 500million on a stadium and , just four weeks after the @entity114 have finished , bring the bulldozers in			0
the @entity24 was built on a promise , made in the @entity118 ’s name , to have a legacy for athletics , ’ she said			0
@entity3 quickly hit back at the @entity121 star and prominent businesswoman			0
‘ accusations that we would ‘ demolish ’ £ 500million of stadium are hugely inaccurate and highly irresponsible and i want to be very clear on this issue			0
@entity7 and @entity5 had been at war over the @entity24 in the past ‘ it is also important to remember that two thirds of the @entity24 , under the original legacy plan , was to be dismantled - it was not designed to be a permanent structure			1
recent scaremongering conveniently forgets this fact			0
’ whatever the reason for the breakdown in the @entity10 transfer , this latest bit of mudslinging will do nothing to improve the relationship between the two clubs .			2
