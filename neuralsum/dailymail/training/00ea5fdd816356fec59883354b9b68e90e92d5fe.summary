experts believed the creatures to be extinct , but a hive of the insects have been breeding for almost 100 years in the eves of a church in @entity16			0
they were discovered in the roof of @entity34 ’s @entity33 after the church warden found the 19th century church littered with bees			2
conservation officer for the @entity39 and @entity42 ( @entity41 ) @entity40 , was called in to help			0
slates were removed from the church by cutting into the roof with an electric saw , but the bees showed no signs of agitation - and no - one was stung			2
@entity40 first recognised the insects ’ unusual dark features			0
he said : ‘ they are generally a lot darker than the @entity56 bee with pale thin strips across the abdomen			0
it takes a specialist bee keeper to recognise them			0
‘ these bees were the native bees in @entity3 after the @entity64 but in the 1830s we started to import foreign bees			1

the @entity8 flu came to the @entity3 in the early 20th century			2
after the disaster , the country was repopulated with bees from abroad , which has led to more species of bee , including the popular honey bee			0
bee experts were called to the church in @entity113 to find a way of tackling the nest , only to realise the pesky bees could have been the rare ‘ apis mellifera mellifera ’ species			2
a handful of dead bees were taken away from the church for examinations to confirm @entity40 ’s hunch that they were @entity3 black honeybees			1
plans are now being made to transfer the bees to a hive before they can be rehomed			0
although no - one connected to the church had noticed the bees , the nest is thought to have been occupied for several years			2
estate maintenance manager , @entity131 said : ‘ it is fascinating that these bees have possibly been here this long even though they were thought to be extinct			0
‘ we now hope that by moving them to a new home they will go from strength to strength with help from experts who know how to take care of them			0
