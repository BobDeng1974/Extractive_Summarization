they are hated by many as an eyesore on the countryside			0
but conventional wind farms may one day become a thing of the past after scientists trialled turbines which can be flown in the sky like kites			2
the turbines , which are being developed by @entity12 , would be tethered 300 metres above ground and would have wings to help them stay air bound			1
@entity25 , @entity12 ’s @entity26 sales director , said the turbines could also save on construction costs			1
speaking at the @entity29 , he said the turbines could spell a solution to the world ’s energy problems			1
he said : ‘ it can make a big difference when it comes to energy			0
‘ it is tethered , has wings and if you go to high altitude flying around bringing energy			2
@entity25 , @entity12 ’s @entity26 sales director , said turbines could spell a solution to the world ’s energy problems floating at high altitudes , they would be powered by higher wind speeds and therefore could increase the amount of energy produced ‘ you have to spend a lot of money on steel and concrete to build these massive turbines and you can only do that in about 15 per cent of the world where the wind is fast enough			1
’ with the tethered turbines , he added , you could use them on ‘ double the amount of land ’			2
he admitted : ‘ it ’s kind of out there			0
’ the turbines are being developed as part of the company ’s @entity65 department			2
it acquired @entity68 , the company originally trialling the technology , last year			1
engineers say the ‘ energy kite ’ has the potential to generate 50 per cent more energy while eliminating 90 per cent of the materials used and for half the cost of conventional wind turbine			1
@entity65 is also working on a number of other pioneering gadgets , including a contact lenses for people with diabetes which can measure the wearer ’s glucose levels			0
mr @entity25 also spoke about @entity12 ’s @entity85 , in which it aims to deliver broadband to very rural areas			1
the concept involves flying balloons equipped with its internet technology at high altitude			0
he said the balloons would use ‘ algorithms to try to figure out how to ride wind currents			0
’ he added : ‘ there are so many parts of the world where if you put broadband in it is so expensive and it will take it forever			0
‘ but if you use balloons it is low cost and you can get hundreds of millions of people on the internet			0

@entity12 is developing *machines* which will be tethered 300 metres in the air
tech giant acquired @entity68 which originally trialled the turbines last year
@entity12 ’s sales director , said this could be a solution to energy problems
engineers say kite has the potential to generate 50 per cent more energy
