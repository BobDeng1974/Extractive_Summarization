pupils expecting @entity2 or a-level results this summer could miss out on top grades after exam boards were told to fix pass rates and grades to match last year			1
the move , outlined in a policy document from the exams regulator @entity10 , is intended to halt year - on - year rises in exam success after the pass rate soared for the 29th year in a row last summer			1
this comes after exam boards were heavily criticised for making errors in papers and handing out unfair grades , as 220,000 pupils battled for just 40,000 university places			2
getting better all the time : there have been concerns over the grading system after @entity2 and a-level results rose for the 29th year running ( file picture ) however , critics claim it could stop exam - takers from reaching the highest grade that they could have done in other years			1
this is the first year in which ' comparable outcomes ' will be used in both gcses and a-levels			0
results will be predicted based on previous cohorts and the past performance of the exam takers - so at @entity41 , gcse grades will be taken into account , and at gcse level , markers will look at pupils ' results from @entity48 tests aged 11			1
an @entity10 document said of the method : ' if we aim for comparable outcomes , roughly the same proportion of students will achieve each grade as in the previous year ...			1
. if necessary we will require exam boards to change their grade boundaries			2
' teachers have claimed the move is a return to ' norm referenced ' a-levels , in which a fixed 10 per cent of pupils would be awarded an a grade each year			1
since this was scrapped in 1987 , the percentage of a grades has risen from 10 per cent to 27 per cent and the pass rate has gone up from 70 per cent to 97.8 per cent			1
overhaul : last year , 200,000 pupils submitted papers for remarking after complaints over errors in papers and unfair grades exam boards received a record number of complaints last year , with 200,000 resubmitting their papers for remarking			0
a-levels results will be released on 16 august this year , with gcse results coming out on 23 august			2
the change in the system comes after controversies over school exams reached new heights			0
exam boards were criticised for errors in papers , with @entity89 forced to apologise in june for a ' confusing ' chemistry a-level question that students complained was impossible to answer			2
last month , hundreds of @entity2 and a-level grades had to be changed after @entity94 markers added up scores on exam papers wrongly			0
there was a scandal last december after an investigation revealed that seminars held by examiners were giving teachers vital information about papers			2
a chief examiner at @entity106 was also caught boasting about how the board had managed to clear easy exams with @entity10			0
@entity109 , head of education policy at the @entity111 , said : ' if @entity10 is just ensuring consistency in exam standards with last year then that is good news			0
' however , we would be concerned if any changes mean that students do nâ€™t get awarded the grades their hard work merits if the grades have been set so that a fixed percentage of students are awarded a * s and @entity41			1
' but @entity10 's chief executive @entity124 insists genuine improvements in teaching and learning standards will still be recognised			0
the policy of ' comparable outcomes ' was in fact introduced at a-level last year and was one of the reasons a * grades only rose from 8.6 per cent to 8.7 per cent			0
headteachers have warned it will make it impossible to deliver on education secretary @entity136 's demand schools increase the percentage of a * to c grade passes at @entity2 in maths and @entity140			1
a @entity142 spokesperson said : ' we are determined to raise standards across the board			0
it is vital that all pupils get the grades their work deserves			0
' ministers have been clear that it is only fair to every hard - working young person that there is no grade inflation or dumbing down in the exams system			1

move intended to stop gross inflation of results
students ' past performance - *including* at @entity48 , aged 11 - will be taken into account
results will be predicted based on past cohorts
teachers fear it is a return to having a fixed percentage at each grade
they warn it will be impossible to deliver on *government* pass - rates targets
