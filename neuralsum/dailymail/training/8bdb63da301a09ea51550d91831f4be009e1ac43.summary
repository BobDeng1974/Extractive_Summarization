sunbathers would not let a long winter stop them from hitting the beach in @entity2 even though the lake has n't even melted yet			1
the banks of @entity5 were speckled with barely - clothed sunbathers on @entity7 just like the lake was sprinkled with mini-icebergs			2
even though temperatures were in the 80s this weekend , that has n't automatically melted the remaining ice			0
not a normal dip in the lake : @entity15 and @entity16 are ' native @entity17 ' and regularly sunbathe on the banks of @entity5 but even though it was warm enough to tan the mini icebergs remained quite the contrast : eager sunbathers took to the shores of @entity5 in @entity2 and @entity23 over @entity7 weekend even though the lake itself was very icy watch out ! a man paddleboards by a large piece of ice that remains frozen in @entity5 on tuesday brave explorer : @entity31 did n't mind her feet getting cold on the trip monday , even though @entity7 is largely considered the kick off to the summer season @entity36 reports that the south shore of the lake , near @entity39 , @entity23 still had plenty of ice near the shore			2
the @entity43 estimates that nearly 5 per cent of the lake is still covered in ice			0
the situation led to plenty of unusual photo opportunities , with bikini - clad beachgoers posing on top of patches of ice on the sun - filled day , as captured by local station @entity52			0
one such brave sun - seeker was @entity54 who went to the shores near @entity56 , @entity2 this weekend			1
' it 's been a goofy year weather-wise , but it is finally feeling summer - ish now ! ' he told @entity59			0
not a cloud in the sky : the air temperature was in the 80s but far from it in the water warmer than it looks : the ice is seen across the lake but , given its size , the ice only comprises of 5 per cent other options : ms @entity31 's friend @entity54 opted for sports sandals when he went venturing on the ice , which still covers an estimated 5 per cent of the lake hard to dip your toes in : @entity54 said that the weather in @entity56 , @entity2 has been particularly ' goofy '			1

the area surrounding the lake was in the 80s this weekend but 5 *%* is still frozen over
brave beach - goers in @entity56 , @entity2 posed for photos on the mini-ice caps during breaks from *laying* out in the sun
