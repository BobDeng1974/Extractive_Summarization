an online shopper got the fright of his life when a live mouse leapt out of his grocery bags and ran around his kitchen			0
@entity6 was unpacking his @entity8 shopping at his home in @entity10 , @entity11 , when he noticed something stirring in one of the bags			1
the 41 - year - old was shocked to then see a mouse dart out from one of the plastic bags and scurry across the floor			0
after he phoned @entity8 to complain , the supermarket sent a team of pest control experts whose trap later caught the creature			1
it was one of the first times mr @entity6 and his wife , @entity37 , 28 , had used @entity8 's online delivery service			1
the car salesman said : ' i was going through the bag and i did n't realise it was there but when i put my hand in i saw something move			0
' i told my wife there was a mouse in the bag and she jumped off the floor			1
it was just so fast			0
it 's the last thing you expect with a delivery			0
' mr @entity6 managed to film the mouse on his mobile phone shortly after it emerged from the rubbish			0
in the footage he captured , the mouse can be seen darting across the floor of the kitchen , which is currently being re-fitted			2

the mouse was later caught in a trap after ' scratching for two nights solid '			2
the animal ran around the couple 's kitchen and disappeared into a hole before being caught by pest control mr @entity6 said the incident left him wondering what might have happened to other people 's shopping which was also on the delivery van			1
