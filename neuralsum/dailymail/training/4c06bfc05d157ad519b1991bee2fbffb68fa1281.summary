the parents of an eight - year - old schoolboy in remission from cancer are facing a school holiday fine for going on a charity - funded trip to @entity6			1
@entity7 , from @entity8 in @entity9 , has been battling cancer for more than a year and was offered the free trip , which is taking place this week , along with his 11 - year - old sister @entity13 and their parents			1
but school chiefs refused permission to allow the youngsters to be absent from classes and have threatened the family with a £ 60 fine			1
@entity7 is currently in remission following intensive treatment for combat @entity39 after being diagnosed in march last year			0
@entity28 and @entity41 say they were ' delighted ' when they were invited on the trip to @entity6 , in @entity45 , @entity46			0
last winter , during his treatment , the family were given permission to take the children out of school for a dream trip to @entity53			0
@entity7 , pictured with his parents @entity28 and @entity41 , in hospital while undergoing intensive cancer treatment the family face fines for taking their children on a charity trip to @entity6 in @entity45 ( pictured ) the trip has been paid for by a @entity9 - based charity which pays for breaks for families affected by cancer now , the children 's schools - @entity65 and @entity68 secondary school , both in @entity9 - say no final decision has yet been made on whether to impose the penalty			1
but mrs @entity71 said the schools are failing to show any compassion by refusing to give permission for the holiday			0
she said : ' @entity7 was diagnosed with @entity77 lymphoma in his bowel in march last year , and has fought really hard and is now in remission			1
' it 's great that @entity82 's retreat have offered to pay for this break , which they want us to take in term time as it uses up less of their funds			2
' but when we approached @entity65 they initially refused the time off , saying @entity7 had already enjoyed a once - in - a - lifetime trip in school time when he went to @entity53 for a day last year			2
' @entity7 won a @entity95 award last year from his local newspaper for his bravery while battling cancer mrs @entity71 says if the fine is imposed for @entity7 and @entity13 she and her husband will refuse to pay it mrs @entity71 said she knew schools were potentially left with no room to manoeuvre due to tough @entity105 guidelines , which only allow extra time off in ' exceptional circumstances '			1
she added : ' i just wish they 'd use their common sense more than anything and show a bit of understanding			0
we are going to refuse to pay the fines if they are imposed			0
' @entity65 headteacher @entity116 and @entity68 headteacher @entity117 issued a joint statement on the case			0
in it , they said : ' we take the welfare and health of all our children seriously and are thrilled that @entity7 is now in remission from @entity127 ’s lymphoma			0
' @entity7 and his family have been supported by his friends and teachers at @entity65 during his treatment and we were happy to approve time out of school last year when @entity7 was offered a once - in - a - lifetime trip to @entity53			2
@entity7 and his family went on a once - in - a - lifetime trip to @entity53 last year during his cancer treatment @entity132 ( pictured ) says it has not yet decided whether to impose the fine for @entity7 's absence ' no decision has yet been made by both schools about whether the family will incur a fine for an unauthorised school absence following their trip to @entity6			2
' however , both schools are guided by the government regulation relating to term - time holidays , and we would support the principle that all children should attend school consistently so they can benefit from the learning we provide			1
' @entity7 won a @entity95 award , run by his local newspaper @entity153 , last year for his bravery while fighting for his life against cancer			0
since @entity158 introduced the holiday ban in september last year , more than 60,000 families have been fined by councils for taking children out of school without approval			0
under new guidelines parents are able to take their children out of school during term time for special occasions in a relaxation of the holiday ban introduced by @entity158 in september last year			1
after a string of controversial cases , the new guidelines drawn up by head teachers make it clear when families can take children away from classes the rules have been backed by new education secretary @entity180 , and will allow children to attend family weddings or funerals , recover after a personal or family crisis , attend a religious event or visiting a relative who is seriously ill under the new guidelines parents will still be prevented from taking advantage of cheap holiday breaks in term time until september 2013 heads could grant up to 10 days leave a year for family holidays in ' special circumstances ' but under mr @entity158 head teachers could grant absence outside school holidays only in ' exceptional circumstances ' it leaves parents facing fines of £ 60 per pupil if they take children out of school for a cheap term time holiday and those who refuse to pay can be fined up to £ 2,500 by the courts and could even be jailed for up to three months the rules are aimed at preventing youngsters missing vital chunks of their education , but became one of mr @entity158 's most unpopular policies in the year before the new legislation was introduced , the number of parents hit with fines soared by nearly 70 per cent some 63,837 penalties were issued to parents in the academic year to july 2014 in @entity218 , compared with 37,650 fines throughout the previous 12 months			1
