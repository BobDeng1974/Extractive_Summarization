making fast food faster : @entity2 reveals its new boneless chicken options , as an alternative to breasts , thighs and drumsticks the new offering reflects the growing popularity of nuggets and strips that are easier to eat on the go , as well as its consumers ' seemingly endless desire for more convenient foods			1
@entity2 says nearly four out of five servings of chicken sold in the @entity36 are now boneless.based on customer trends , the chain says bones could eventually disappear from its menu			1
" @entity44 people do n't tend to be fans of bones — they 've grown up with nuggets , " said @entity2 spokesman @entity40 , referring to people in their 20s and 30s			1
although @entity2 has more than 18,000 locations worldwide , the boneless chicken will only be offered in its 4,500 @entity36 locations			1
the new chicken , which is skinless and comes in white or dark meat , are whole muscle pieces fileted off the bone and are about twice the size of @entity2 's crispy strips			2

@entity2 says it took two to three years to develop its version of boneless chicken , which performed strongly in test markets including @entity107 and @entity108 last year			1
like @entity111 's and @entity112 , chicken chain @entity109 offers nuggets , strips and sandwiches but does n't list any chicken pieces with bones on its menu			2

@entity2 is owned by @entity134 , which also operates @entity143 and @entity144			0
despite its choppy performance in the @entity36 , @entity134 has enjoyed a streak of growth for the past several years as a result of its growing presence in @entity150			0
@entity134 is the largest @entity151 fast - food operator in the country with about 5,300 locations , most of them @entity2 restaurants			2
but since late last year , @entity134 has been working to overcome a scare over its chicken supply that has hammered sales in @entity150			0
@entity134 , based in @entity158 , @entity159 , has warned that it expects its profit in 2013 to decline , snapping an 11 - year streak of double - digit growth			0
shares of @entity134 fell $ 2.17 , or 3.2 percent , to $ 65.58 in morning trading as broad market indicators sagged on weaker than expected @entity36 job growth in march .			0
