@entity1 's christening went perfectly , by all accounts , with a smiling baby and a mother who could barely contain her joy			1
what a contrast to the christening of @entity9 ’s father @entity8 31 years ago			1
on that day , august 4 , 1982 , the ceremony took place in the ornate cream music room at @entity13 , a far more formal choice than the @entity15 in @entity16 where @entity9 was christened yesterday			1
relaxed affair : the @entity18 and @entity19 smiled throughout the ceremony , while the circumspect baby prince appeared to follow proceedings with interest ' a trial ' @ a radiant @entity24 later admitted she found @entity8 's christening exhausting princess @entity24 , just 21 and wearing a fuchsia pink , blue and white floral dress with a pink hat set at a rakish angle , looked radiant			1
but she later confided to friends that it had been a trial			0
‘ no one consulted me as to whether 11am would fit in with @entity8 ’s schedule , ’ she said			1
‘ i was totally excluded , totally exhausted and the photos went on and on			1
i blubbed my eyes out			0
’ she was n’t alone			0
her son – @entity8 , 44 days old – may have uttered only three small cries as the then archbishop of @entity40 , @entity39 , poured water over his head , but he grumbled his way through the subsequent photo session			2
formalities : @entity24 holds @entity8 in the official photo from his christeningm accompanied by the @entity48 , prince @entity18 and the @entity49 future king : the three month old @entity1 , at @entity15 in @entity16 , before the ceremony began prince @entity52 dabbed at his son ’s tears with a handkerchief and @entity24 tried to soothe @entity8 by popping her finger in his mouth to suck			1
but every time she took it away , he cried some more			0
most of the senior royals were in attendance for @entity8 ’s baptism , whereas just five attended yesterday ’s event : the @entity48 and the @entity18 , prince @entity52 and the @entity65 and prince @entity66			1
prince @entity67 has missed out on both occasions			0
he was n’t invited to @entity9 ’s baptism , and could n’t go to @entity8 ’s because he was still in the @entity70 after the @entity72 conflict			2
nor did the late princess @entity73 attend @entity8 ’s baptism			2
she was in @entity74 , combining a holiday with official engagements			0
mother 's pride : there were some similarities between the two events matching outfits : @entity19 carries her son after the christening , accompanied by the @entity65 and @entity85 @entity1 was incredibly well - behaved during the day 's proceedings			1
@entity48 called the event a ' very nice ' family occasion proud grandfather : the @entity90 and @entity65 leave the @entity15 the @entity49 was there , of course – the date was chosen to coincide with her 82nd birthday – as was @entity95 , @entity24 ’s brother ( another notable exception yesterday )			1
the @entity48 wore an outfit of periwinkle blue with white spots , and yesterday she was in blue again			0
in contrast to @entity24 ’s vividly coloured frock , @entity19 went for neutral cream			2
once the 25 - minute ceremony to baptise @entity8 was over , the party moved into the @entity106 next to the @entity107 for the photographs , which were taken by @entity109 , a @entity110 photographer of the ‘ old school ’			2
finally there was a formal lunch			0
there was no such formal sit - down meal yesterday			2
instead , the proud parents hosted an informal tea party at @entity118			0
the whole event , declared the @entity48 , was a ‘ very nice ’ family occasion			0
queen @entity121 : in profile , the family characteristics are clear to see			0
right , a chubby - cheeked @entity8 at his own christening in 1982 some things , however , do n’t change			1
those rounded cheeks , that thoughtful gaze ... whether it be @entity1 , his father @entity8 , or his great , great , great , great , great granny , queen @entity121 , the family resemblance is uncanny			1
there are no photographs showing @entity121 ’s christening , but the undated photograph below of the elderly widowed monarch still shows that @entity138 has inherited many family characteristics .			0

heir to the throne 's perfect day was far cry from his father 's
@entity24 said she felt ' excluded and exhausted ' at @entity8 's 1982 christening
@entity8 's *celebration* far more formal than yesterday 's events
