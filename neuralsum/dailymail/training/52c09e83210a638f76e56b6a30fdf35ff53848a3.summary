@entity1 laws on food labelling mean the details on the packaging of probiotic drinks are always rather vague it started with those little bottles of sickly - sweet - tasting yogurt shots , and today probiotics can be found in everything from fortified milks and supplements to face creams – and all claim the ‘ friendly bacteria ’ they contain can do us a world of good			1

how probiotics help : a recent study found that taking a daily probiotic supplement could give @entity80 sufferers that little dose of sunshine they desperately need , boosting levels of @entity84 by more than 25 per cent			1
the study ’s lead author , dr @entity103 , commented : ‘ although it has long been known that the gastrointestinal tract plays an active role in the absorption of @entity84 , these findings showing increased levels of @entity84 after taking a probiotic orally are a first , and will inform the development of new products that may be beneficial for people with low @entity84 levels			2
