i hope the @entity2 critics will pipe down now			1
it was a moment that flashed by , it happened in the blink of an eye			0
but it proved that @entity2 has world - class ability , and if he adds consistency to his game for club and country – in terms of performance and fitness – then he may be considered world class sooner rather than later			1
@entity15 had just conceded an own goal on saturday and were trailing 1 - 0 to a side sitting just behind them in the group			1
@entity20 were setting out to stop @entity15 getting back into the game so a bit of magic was needed from someone wearing the @entity15			2
@entity2 put in a man - of - the - match performance in @entity15 's 3 - 1 win over @entity27 at @entity28 @entity2 poses for a photo on the pitch with @entity15 fitness coach @entity31 at @entity32 straight after the restart , @entity2 demanded and received the ball from @entity35 in the @entity28 centre circle			1
he turned and with an opponent on top of him , had the option of passing backwards to @entity40 , or sideways to @entity41			0
neither were bad options , both would have meant @entity15 kept possession , which of course is vital			2
@entity2 chose to do neither			2
instead he turned and smartly flicked the ball away from the opponent with his left foot and scooted away , leading the charge and leaving his man standing			2
that was a touch of world - class ability			0
had he lost the ball @entity15 could easily have found themselves two down			2
@entity2 is often a target for criticism but he has the ability to be a world - class player for @entity15 and @entity59 but with incredible speed of thought and feet , @entity2 controlled the ball , gauged how quickly his opponent was charging in and executed a move to open the pitch up			1
it meant @entity20 players had to close him down leaving spaces for @entity2 to exploit			2
so the next task , having created space for himself , was to spot a pass			0
and he found @entity72 with a perfect ball			0
the captain ran at @entity27 , won a penalty and @entity15 were level seconds after going behind			1
that @entity77 link - up is something i ’ve written about before in this column			0
it ’s a special understanding few players have			1
@entity72 converts @entity15 's penalty to equalise after @entity2 's hard work in midfield from the moment @entity2 receives the ball to the penalty being awarded takes less than nine seconds			1
that ’s the kind of special football @entity15 need to produce in games			1
the more @entity2 feels comfortable doing that sort of thing in the middle of the park in an @entity15 shirt , the more likely it is to happen in a tournament against a big team			1
i ’m not saying @entity2 is world class			0
i am saying he has the ability to become world class			0
in terms of international football , the real test will come at the @entity106 of course			0
but i ’m delighted to see @entity2 , a player of such immense promise , starting to consistently fulfill that			0
@entity2 has n't always had it his own way at @entity59 with stalled progress over the last couple years apparently @entity113 , a player of immense talent who i greatly admired , said @entity2 did n’t deserve man of the match , even adding that no @entity15 player was worth it			1
that must be disappointing for the @entity59 midfielder after he grabbed hold of the game when @entity15 went behind			1
it takes special character to demand the ball when the pressure is on and the team is n’t playing well			0
it takes special talent to then do what @entity2 did for the equaliser			2
i ’m comfortable criticising @entity15 when it ’s due			0
but when a player delivers , let ’s give him the credit he deserves			0

@entity2 had a magic moment in @entity15 's win over @entity27
with @entity15 1 - 0 down , the @entity59 man left his opponent and advanced
the play ended with @entity15 winning a penalty , scored by @entity72
the @entity147 link up is a special understanding
it was the kind of special football @entity15 need to produce
