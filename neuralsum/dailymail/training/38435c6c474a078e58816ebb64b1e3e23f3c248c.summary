by @entity0 published : 09:53 est , 24 may 2013 updated : 12:32 est , 24 may 2013 the secret behind the spacesuits than put @entity4 has been revealed as a team of seamstresses from underwear firm @entity7			1
they worked with engineers to design a suit capable of keeping a man alive in orbit - and saw their design work by the @entity14 astronauts			2
the incredible story is set to be made into a major @entity18 movie , it was revealed today			1
@entity19 walking on the surface of the moon during the @entity23 extravehicular activity ( @entity24 ) on on july 20 , 1969 wearing his handmade spacesuit created by an offshoot of the @entity7 company every @entity14 suit was handmade to fit each astronaut by @entity7 , a division of @entity7			1
every @entity14 suit was made to fit each astronaut			1
each @entity14 mission required fifteen suits to support the mission			2
the main , or prime , three - man crew each had three suits : i for flight ; 1 for training ; and 1 as a flight back - up in case something happened to their flight suit , thus a total of 9 suits for the prime crew			0
the back - up three - man crew each had two suits : @entity50 for flight and i for training			0
the astronaut corps at that time included between 25 and 27 astronauts			0
the film , to be called @entity57 , will be based on a book by @entity59 called @entity57 : @entity14			1
' a spacesuit is made out of a flight suit , a @entity63 tyre , a bra , a girdle , a raincoat , a tomato worm , ' @entity59 says in the book			2
he says the seamstresses were able to sew far more accurately that other teams vying for the @entity71 contract			1
' they had to sew to a 1/64th of an inch tolerance without using any pins , he told website txchnologist			0
' so there was no question that it was kind of a couture handicraft object versus something made according to more conventional military industrial principles			0
' like few others in the whole process , they really had the lives of the astronauts literally in their hands			0
' he also believe @entity71 played down their involvement in the project			2
' within the larger culture of the military industrial complex that @entity71 was a part of , having a girdle manufacturer was , if not embarrassing , than certainly less than totally expected			1
' @entity7 , a division of @entity7 , where workers are sewing the @entity14 spacesuits the different materials in an @entity98 suit the @entity99 described how , as underdogs , the @entity7 team secured the contract with their innovative - thinking , couture - level sewing skills and sheer determination			1
' @entity7 ’s team [ @entity7 , a division of @entity7 ] , a motley group of seamstresses and engineers , led by a car mechanic and a former television repairman , manages to convince @entity71 to let them enter their ' test suit ' in a closed , invitation - only competitive bid at their own expense , ' the review says			1
' they spend six weeks working around the clock - at times breaking into their own offices to work 24 - hour shifts - to arrive at a suit solution that starkly outperforms the two invited competitors			0
the apollo 11 team leaving to board their rocket , wearing their @entity7 spacesuits an early prototype suit built by @entity126 , showing the life support system ' in open , direct competition with larger , more moneyed companies , @entity7 manages to produce a superior space suit by drawing on the craft - culture handiwork and expertise of seamstresses , rather than on the hard - line culture of engineering			1
' the firm has gone on to huge success , and still makes @entity71 's spacesuits			2
other @entity7 products include the airbag landing devices for @entity141 and @entity142 ( @entity142 ) missions ; lighter - than - air vehicles , including airships , aerostats , and zeppelins ; chemical , biological , radiological , and nuclear ( @entity152 ) masks and hood systems ; and flexible powder - containment solutions for the pharmaceutical industry			0
early tests of the suit system conducted by @entity71 and @entity7 @entity157 now plans to make a film of the project , and has hired @entity160 to script it			1
@entity164 ’s @entity163 brought the project to the studio , and @entity167 and @entity168 will produce with @entity169 overseeing development			0
@entity171 and @entity172 are exec producers and @entity174 and @entity175 are overseeing for the studio , according to @entity177			0
@entity179 's spacesuit , the first man - made clothing to touch the lunar surface			0
it is now held by the @entity184			0
