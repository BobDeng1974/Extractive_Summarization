@entity0 has come under fire for selling laptops that come pre-installed with a ' horrifically dangerous ' software named @entity4			1
the @entity6 computer manufacturer says @entity7 helps users find products online by analysing images and presenting similar , cheaper products			0
but security analysts claim that what @entity4 actually does is serve intrusive ads , as well as compromise private information such as bank details and passwords			1
the @entity4 software appears to affect @entity18 and @entity19 on the @entity0 laptops sold between september 2014 and january 2015 the @entity4 software appears to affect @entity18 and @entity19 on the @entity0 laptops sold between september 2014 and january 2015			1
and users have been raising concerns about @entity4 since september the biggest concern is that @entity4 makes people vulnerable to something known as a ' man in the middle ' attack			1
' the way the @entity4 functionality appears to work means that they must be intercepting traffic in order to insert the ads , ' said @entity35 , a researcher at @entity36			1
' this amounts to a wiretap			0
@entity40 adware breaks @entity41 – or encrypted - connections to serve up product information			0
pictured is an example found by @entity46			0
this inadvertently opens up a back door to hackers the software allows hackers to impersonate the security certificates of encrypted websites , allowing them to potentially see and steal private data			1

the @entity4 software appears to affect @entity18 and @entity19 on the @entity0 laptops sold between september 2014 and january 2015			1
users can find out if they are affected by looking at @entity65 ' list of trusted certificates by opening up the @entity67 and searching for ' certificates '			0
if @entity4 is one of them , the computer may be vulnerable to attack			2
rather than simply uninstalling the programme , users are advised to back everything up on their systems and install a new operating system			0
while the site visited appears secure , when its certificate is analysed it 's shown to belong to @entity4 , rather than the site visited			2
anyone with the password that unlocks that certificate would be able to bypass the computer 's web encryption			0
this morning , researchers found and published the password , meaning the software can now be used as a channel for attack ' this means that hackers at your local cafe @entity94 , or the @entity96 eavesdropping on the internet , can use that private - key to likewise intercept all @entity102 [ encrypted ] connections from @entity4 users , ' @entity98 of @entity99 told @entity104			1
he added this amounted to ' an egregious security failure … its intent is so that @entity4 can ' hack ' you , and it opens the system up to hacks by others			1

in a statement earlier today , @entity0 said the company had ' thoroughly investigated this technology and [ does ] not find any evidence to substantiate security concerns ' rather than simply uninstalling the programme , users are advised to back everything up on their systems and install a new operating system			1
a @entity0 community administrator , @entity130 , wrote in january that the software would be temporarily removed from current systems			2
writing for the @entity134 , @entity133 says the software is ' horrifically dangerous '			0
he added : ' @entity0 has not just injected ads in a wildly inappropriate manner , but engineered a massive security catastrophe for its users			2
' in a statement earlier today , @entity0 said the company had ' thoroughly investigated this technology and [ does ] not find any evidence to substantiate security concerns			1
' however , @entity4 will no longer be pre-installed and has been disabled on all products in the market since january , when @entity0 also stopped pre-installing the software			1
@entity0 has not yet responded to @entity148 for comment			0
concerns about cybersecurity have dogged @entity6 firms , including telecoms equipment maker @entity153 over ties to @entity6 's government and smartphone maker @entity156 over data privacy			0
@entity0 commanded one - fifth of the global pc market in the third quarter of 2014 , according to data research firm @entity160			2

@entity4 is *designed* to place adverts into @entity167 search *results*
it affects @entity18 and @entity19 in *recent* @entity0 *pcs*
it also allows hackers to impersonate certificates of encrypted sites
this means they can steal data such as bank details and passwords
@entity0 claims the software does not ' substantiate security concerns '
