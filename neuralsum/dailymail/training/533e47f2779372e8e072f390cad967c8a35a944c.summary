by @entity0 a pioneering operation that shrinks the heart without surgery has been carried out in @entity4 for the first time – and may help thousands of people with heart failure			1
a drawstring - like device is used to shut off damaged heart tissue			1
it has given a new lease of life to the first @entity13 to undergo the procedure			2
before the operation , @entity15 was so breathless he could not walk			2
revolution : how the new non-bypass @entity19 surgery is carried out he had suffered two silent heart attacks that caused a large area of damage to his heart – sending him into heart failure , in which the heart enlarges and can not pump effectively			1
‘ there was very little i could do without having to stop as i was out of breath and exhausted			2
just going upstairs at home was an effort , ’ says the 58 - year - old , who has diabetes			1
heart failure affects more than 750,000 people in the @entity4			1
‘ when people are not able to walk around because their heart is too weak , they are at increased risk of death , ’ says professor of cardiac surgery @entity37 , who carried out the operation at @entity40 in @entity41			1
‘ it is not unusual for a patient to have heart attacks without knowing – and the patient has no idea of the damage caused			1
they become aware something is n’t right when minor exercises cause breathlessness and simple tasks become difficult			2
diabetics are at high risk of developing coronary heart disease , and scarring from heart attacks is one of the main reasons for developing heart failure			1
’ important care : heart failure affects more than 750,000 people in the @entity4 if the heart has been scarred , the damaged area is useless			1
the conventional operation for heart scarring is to stop the heart and cut out the scarred area while the patient is kept alive on a heart - bypass machine			1
but this is a risky procedure that does n’t always produce an improvement			2
given mr @entity15 ’s frail health , mr @entity37 decided to try the new operation – known as @entity19 , or live			1
@entity19 can be performed without bypass			1
it is still necessary to make an incision of 12 to 15cm to open up the chest wall			0
however , the heart does n’t have to be cut open			1
then , using an x-ray , a needle guides a wire through the left ventricle – one of the heart ’s four chambers – and across the scarred area of the heart			1
the wire is anchored to the walls of the chamber – and then pulled taut to seal off the scarred part of left ventricle			0
this significantly reduces the size of the left ventricle , which is the part responsible for pumping blood around the body and which swells and scars during a heart attack			2
with the scarring sealed off , the ‘ resized ’ organ is able to pump much more effectively			0
mr @entity15 , from @entity111 , @entity41 , first developed breathing difficulties last year , over several months			0
he said : ‘ my family urged me to get the breathlessness checked and i was referred to @entity115 ’s by my local hospital			0
when they scanned me , they could see the scarring and the cardiologist reckoned i ’d had two “ silent ” heart attacks without any pain			2
’ before being referred for the procedure this summer , mr @entity15 was worried that he would n’t see his two young grandsons grow up			0
‘ i was told it might give me another ten years , which would be great			0
no one knows precisely because i ’m the first in this country to have had it			0
but i ’m definitely feeling the benefit			0
’ the hour - long operation is being tested at hospitals across @entity132 and mr @entity37 believes it could help many thousands of patients			2
‘ if successful , the operation can bring patients on to an exercise level where they ’re able to look after themselves properly , including doing the shopping and having a social life , ’ he says			0
‘ it ’s superb that mr @entity15 is doing so well			0
’ @entity142 fan mr @entity15 had stopped attending football matches because he ran out of breath walking to the ground			0
but now he is going again , as well as taking long walks			0
‘ last week i walked over a mile , ’ he says			0
‘ afterwards i felt fantastic			0
