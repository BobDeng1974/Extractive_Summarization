by @entity0 they came from near and far , the great and good of football , to pay tribute to one of their own			2
but this was no occasion for revelling in tales of past sporting glories			0
instead , and quite rightly , the funeral service for @entity10 concentrated more on the man than on the footballer			2
@entity13 was mentioned as an enduring friend first , team - mate second			2
the recollection of a young @entity10 spending his first @entity18 bonus on a fur coat for his mum , meanwhile , said more than any list of medals ever could			1
on a bitterly cold morning in @entity24 , hundreds gathered at @entity25 not because @entity10 was famous as a @entity18 , @entity26 and @entity28 player			1
they turned out to show their respect for a man who , as the reverend @entity32 made clear , valued ‘ love , loyalty and respect ’ above even the most glittering prizes on offer during his career			0
honour : sir @entity40 and @entity41 arriving to pay their respects at @entity10 's funeral tribute : @entity47 rock singer @entity46 sent a touching note to the former @entity18 fullback past and present : @entity18 legend @entity50 ( left ) and current club captain @entity51 arrive @entity13 , the @entity52 , was one of the pall bearers on a day that saw some of the @entity47 game ’s most well - respected figures in attendance			1
sir @entity40 chatted with @entity41 and @entity59 , @entity60 were represented by @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 , while neither @entity64 nor @entity65 would have even considered missing the occasion			1
of course , plenty more of @entity10 ’s old team - mates from the class of ’ 72 were in attendance , the @entity72 victory that bound them together in the 40 odd years since only a small part of the affection they felt for @entity10			1
hearts were represented , too , in the shape of current boss @entity79 and former manager @entity80 , while the entire @entity18 first team – including coach @entity82 , on crutches – arrived together			1
@entity10 ’s love of music was evident even before the hearse arrived , with speakers outside the main chapel relaying recordings of @entity89 and @entity90 , while he was borne into the chapel to @entity92			2
the service itself began with an apology of sorts , the @entity97 explaining that he would be using both of @entity10 ’s @entity99 names – he was @entity10 to the outside world but always @entity62 to the family – throughout			2
the minister having begged forgiveness for any confusion caused , he proceeded with a ceremony that was quietly religious , although the volume did rise as mourners joined in a rendition of @entity110			0
club men : @entity18 manager @entity112 ( left ) and former assistant manager @entity113 also attended respects : @entity18 legend @entity115 arrives ahead of the funeral of former team - mate one mourner outside @entity25 holds the order of service ahead of the funeral the eulogy was delivered by best friend @entity123 , who said : ‘ the three things that @entity62 loved most were football , friends and family			1
‘ we all know about @entity62 , or should i say @entity10 , @entity10 ’s reputation as a legendary @entity18 and @entity28 footballer			1
‘ to all football fans , no matter where their allegiances lay , he will be remembered as one of the greatest ambassadors of the game			0
‘ he was a wonderful player who played to win but played fairly , and bore no grudges once the final whistle was blown			0
‘ to the legions of @entity18 fans , he will quite rightly be remembered not only for his football ability but as someone who served the club with great distinction and loyalty – particularly through the recent financial crisis			2
‘ if you read a newspaper in the past week , you ’ll all know the statistics about caps and trophies won			1
‘ as @entity112 said , though , i ’d rather talk about the man than the footballer			0
‘ so it ’s @entity62 , the family friend			0
not @entity10 , the @entity18 legend			1
’ legend : @entity10 was a @entity18 hero and won 38 caps for @entity28 between 1971 and 1980 grief : @entity18 fans laid hundreds of fans in tribute to their former defender			1
@entity162 was made of @entity10 ’s childhood in @entity24 , his love of cards and golf , and his refusal ever to forget his old pals when he hit the big time			2
to illustrate just how grounded the young up - and - coming footballer was at a time when his head might easily have been turned , @entity123 – who recalled @entity10 ’s daily commute to training in the company of @entity13 , a firm friend until the end – revealed : ‘ he signed for @entity18 in 1964 and his first bonus was paid in cash			1
‘ @entity62 sat on the bus tightly holding his pocket , because he was terrified that he might lose the money			0
but he took it home and bought his mum a fur coat			0
’ there were laughs , as @entity10 would have wanted , with one tale about he and former @entity18 chief executive @entity189 getting confused between sinks and urinals in a restaurant at the top of the @entity194 thankfully short on detail			1
@entity10 did a great deal with his close - knit group of childhood pals , including travelling to watch the masters a few years ago – and scoring tickets for the 100 metres final at the @entity201			1
@entity123 , with a nod to his old friend ’s renowned turn of pace , recalled : ‘ when @entity206 flashed past the winning post , @entity62 announced that , 45 years ago , he would have given him a run for his money			0
’ tragedy : former @entity18 chief executive @entity189 struggles to hold back tears emotional : @entity112 during a minutes silence for @entity10 before @entity18 ' last match thanks were offered to the many friends who had visited with @entity10 in the few months since he was told that the cancer he ’d battled so bravely since november 2012 was now terminal			1
and , of course , much of the focus was on his wife , @entity222 , children @entity223 and @entity225 , as well as the seven grandchildren who brought him so much joy on those days out at @entity228			0
@entity123 , who paid tribute to the @entity230 and the @entity232 staff who helped his friend , added : ‘ @entity62 ’s strength of character and courage was beyond belief			0
never once did we hear him complain or ask : “ why me ? ” ‘ in all the years i ’ve known him , @entity62 was never one to talk about himself			0
he ’ s got two ears and one mouth – and he uses them in that proportion			0
‘ we should make sure that his memory lives on in all of us			0
he was simply the best			0
’ @entity32 , who spoke movingly about @entity10 ’s integrity , honesty , tolerance and remarkable commitment to self - discipline , treating his body like a temple , followed readings and poems by leading mourners in the singing of my way			1
the order of service for the day summed up the collective feeling of so many present , a picture of @entity10 on the back accompanied by the words : ‘ a legend in his lifetime			2
