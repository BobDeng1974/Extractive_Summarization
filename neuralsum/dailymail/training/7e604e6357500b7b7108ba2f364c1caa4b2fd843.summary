having claimed he felt like a supply teacher in his previous managerial role , @entity0 had a response ready for his @entity5 unveiling			1
‘ i ’m the headmaster now ! ’ he grinned			2
his five - month spell last season as @entity9 head coach saw him gain the highest @entity11 win ratio of any boss at @entity13 but also hear repeated questions about his position			1
‘ i kept getting told “ this man wants your job ” and “ that man ’s been spoken to			2
” it was every week , ’ he recalled			2
@entity5 boss @entity0 was unveiled at @entity21 on monday @entity0 was speaking on monday at his press conference unveiling to the media as their new manager score some goals — @entity5 have mustered just 12 @entity11 goals so far			1
@entity0 said getting @entity27 to improve on his tally of three this season is key			1
‘ i ’m sure we can tap into that confidence and get him back firing , ’ he said			2
revealing his half - time team - talk against @entity34 , he said : ‘ i told them to play with less fear			2
we need to play with a little more freedom			2
’ find an assistant manager — @entity39 not joining will be a ‘ loss ’ , @entity0 admitted , with his former @entity9 colleague now in charge at @entity42			1
@entity45 ’s no 2 @entity44 has been mentioned but @entity0 ruled him out and said he wo n’t rush into the decision			1
get the fans onside — pretty much sorted by @entity0 ’s mere presence , following angry scenes at @entity51 ’s last match - the defeat to @entity53			1
@entity0 talked a good game as well			1
he said : ‘ i think every club needs excitement , the fans pay their money and we need to give them that			2
’ ‘ i dealt with it and got on with the job			0
what was i going to do ? roll in the corner and die ? i ’m not going to do that			0
i ’ll fight till the bitter end			0
’ that is the psychology desperately needed at @entity5 now			1
they are in a scrap and , as @entity0 insisted , ‘ need to start throwing a few punches ’			1
there was more than words of blood and thunder but his immediate understanding that @entity5 have been gripped by attacking apprehension is fundamental to their chances of survival			1
under @entity51 , @entity5 scored just 12 @entity11 goals in 25 games to sit 18th in the table			1
‘ i think they fear losing too much , ’ explained @entity0			1
‘ it has to hurt them to lose but they can not worry			0
’ six wins is his initial target			0
the key , he insisted , was getting @entity27 back firing , comparing the @entity92 striker to @entity93 , who enjoyed a renaissance once @entity0 took over at @entity9			1
‘ yes , it was the case with @entity99 and it could possibly be the case with @entity100			0
we hope it will be , ’ said @entity0 , who revealed one message during his half - time intervention against @entity34 on sunday was to supply @entity27 with the ball more often			1
‘ i remember playing against @entity27 as a manager what a handful he can be			2
we need to get back to that			0
all the best clubs in the world were after him			0
i ’m sure @entity9 were interested			1
‘ it ’s not a one - man team though			0
there are a lot of big players			0
no one wants to get relegated			0
it will hurt them to drop into the @entity114			0
we ca n’t let that happen			0
they need to start performing			0
’ @entity27 failed to find the back of the net once more as @entity5 progressed past @entity34 in the @entity118 @entity0 believes he can the best out of @entity27 before the end of the season with @entity5 @entity0 has the best win percentage ( 59.1 ) of any @entity9 manager in @entity11 history			1
current manager @entity125 is third with a win % of 52			2
@entity0 famously rattled a few cages when offering a frank assessment on @entity9 players following a 4 - 0 defeat to @entity131			1
‘ lacking guts and character , ’ he said			0
‘ watch this space ! ’ he grinned again when asked if he would deliver similar stinging assessments at @entity5			1
‘ if i ’m going to be guilty of something it will be honesty , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ if they do well they will be told			0
if they do n’t do well they will also be told			0
some people need to be patted on the back			0
some people need a kick up the backside			0
’ @entity0 acted as a breath of fresh air at a club where a stale odour had begun to cling			1
he knows a sharp shock is needed to jolt positive results out of an underperforming squad			0
‘ right now it ’s all about winning , ’ he said			0
‘ do n’t expect too many 18 - years - olds on saturday ( against @entity156 )			2
’ @entity0 will begin his search for an assistant soon , but it will not be @entity39 , his trusted lieutenant at @entity9 , who is now in charge at @entity42			1
‘ @entity39 will be a loss because he ’s very good at what he does , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ he ’s got a different role now			0
interestingly enough , i hope he makes a mess of it ! ’ @entity0 has targeted six wins from @entity5 's final 13 @entity11 matches to ensure safety the @entity21 managerial job is the second of @entity0 's career after starting out at @entity9 last season he said talks broke down on his own move to @entity173 because ‘ it was n’t right for either party ’ and conceded he believed the @entity175 job was ‘ quite close ’ before @entity177 took the reins			1
‘ the longer you stay out people think “ ooh , might not get back in ” , ’ admitted @entity0			1
‘ a lot of the time i was out it was my choice			0
’ @entity0 will finish his @entity186 in september on a course run by the @entity188 alongside @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 and @entity193			2
on the subject of his credentials at this level , the 46 - year - old said plainly : ‘ there are a lot of poor experienced managers			0
’ @entity202 owner @entity201 , who has the club on the market , has offered only a brief telephone conversation so far , with chief executive @entity206 handling affairs in @entity208			0
‘ every club is up for sale at the right price , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ i ca n’t worry about that			0
’ prices in the club shop for gilets , @entity0 ’s signature touchline attire , have been chopped from £ 42 to £ 29 — a reduction pre-dating his arrival			2
he walked in wearing a suit and v - neck jumper , prompting one reporter immediately to question the whereabouts of his customary garb			0
‘ i thought it would be two seconds before i heard a gilet joke , ’ he said			0
‘ it was one ! ’ @entity5 have left it late to make a change , but judging by @entity0 ’s comic timing , they have the man for the challenge			1
@entity5 have put their club gilets on sale following the appointment of @entity0 the gilets have been reduced in price to £ 29 and were a popular item choice to wear by @entity0 at @entity9 @entity0 ( centre ) watched from the stands as his new side were in action at @entity21			1
