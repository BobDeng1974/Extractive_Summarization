by @entity0 for @entity1 a four - year - old was diagnosed with leukaemia when her worried mother researched her symptoms on the internet , having been told by a doctor the toddler had an ear infection			1
@entity10 is now facing two years of gruelling chemotherapy and radiotherapy after tests confirmed she had the blood cancer last month			1
her mother , @entity15 , first suspected something was seriously wrong when her daughter kept falling asleep at nursery			1
the 23 - year - old took her daughter to a local gp , who diagnosed the toddler with a viral infection and sent her home with antibiotics			1
after being told her daughter @entity27 was suffering a viral infection , @entity26 felt it was something more serious and took to @entity31 to research the four - year - old 's symptoms after taking @entity35 to @entity36 , tests revealed the four - year - old had an extremely high white blood cell count , leading doctors to diagnose her with leukaemia but ms @entity10 , from @entity41 in @entity42 , was convinced there was something more to @entity27 's condition , and turned to the internet to research her symptoms			1
days later she rushed her daughter into @entity36 where tests revealed the four - year - old was suffering an aggressive form of leukaemia			1
she was admitted to the @entity51 before being transferred to @entity52 where she started chemotherapy			0
ms @entity10 , who has shaved her head in support of her daughter , said : ' it 's horrible , you never expect something like this to happen to your baby girl			1
' we 're all in this together and we just hope my little girl will get better			0
' i took her to the @entity20 because she had been falling asleep at nursery and she said she had earache			1
' i kept taking her to the doctors who gave her antibiotics as they thought it was a viral thing			2
' i went onto the internet and put her symptoms into @entity31 and a number of medical websites suggested it could be cancer			2
' then when she fell asleep at nursery again , i knew i had to bring her to the hospital - but you still do n't expect to be told your baby has cancer			1
' it still feels like a dream but , if i am strong , then @entity10 is strong			2
i did n't want her to feel left out , or feel like the only person , so i shaved my hair			0
' i do n't think she fully understands			0
she knows she 's poorly but not how serious it is			0
' she was always having bruises and was n't herself			0
' @entity85 first fell ill at the beginning of july , suffering an ear and throat infection			1
ms @entity10 and her daughter pictured before @entity85 fell ill @entity85 first fell ill in july with an ear and throat infection			1
but when she kept falling asleep at nursery , her mother became really concerned ms @entity10 , who has shaved her hair to support her daughter , said @entity27 is facing two years of chemotherapy and radiotherapy as doctors try to treat her disease blood cancer is an umbrella term for cancers that affect the blood , bone marrow and lymphatic system			1
the diseases can be life - threatening , partly because they stop the immune system working properly			0
when a person 's immune system is badly damaged , they can die from an infection their body could normally fight off			2
every 20 minutes , someone in the @entity114 is told they have a blood cancer - that is 70 people a day , or 25,000 people a year			1
many more live with debilitating – and sometimes life - threatening – blood disorders , including sickle cell disease and thalassemia			0
some types of blood cancer are more common than others : source : @entity127 two weeks later , on july 15 , ms @entity10 took the four - year - old to hospital where tests revealed an extremely high white blood cell count and she was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia			1
the next day , she was transferred to @entity52 where she was given steroids , antibiotics and started chemotherapy			0
@entity85 has now been allowed home but she needs drugs every day and a lumbar puncture - where a needle is injected into her spine - once a week			2
@entity10 's grandmother @entity142 , 42 , said : ' at first she was n't happy when we said she 's going to lose her hair , because it was really long and she thought she was @entity146			2
' bits had been coming out , then the day it all came out in a big clump she looked in a mirror and said , ' it 's okay , it will grow back '			0
' if it had n't been for @entity10 , how she 's coped , i think we would all be in bits			2
' seeing how strong she is with everything she 's going through , she still smiles			0
' getting the diagnosis was devastating			0
@entity15 had been putting the symptoms into the internet , as a lot of parents do , and that was one thing that came up			0
' i told her to shut up , it 's not going to be that			0
it 's going to be a viral infection as the doctor thought , or she 's anaemic			1
so we were all devastated			0
' usually when children are diagnosed with leukaemia , they do a lumbar puncture to confirm it			0
' @entity10 's white blood count should be between eight and 10 but it was 300 so they knew straight away			1
' it was fortunate @entity15 took her to hospital when she did because it meant they could start treatment straight away			0
we are keeping positive for @entity10 's sake			2
