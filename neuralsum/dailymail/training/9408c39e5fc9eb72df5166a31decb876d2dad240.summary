by @entity0 a teacher has been summoned to court and faces a £ 1,000 fine because her wheelie bin juts out just 12 inches beyond the boundary of her home			1
@entity7 , 47 , is to appear at @entity8 after her local council said the grey plastic bin could present a hazard to drivers and disabled people			1
it said the bin could prevent grass from being cut - even though there is not a patch of green in sight around the rear of her three - bedroom home			1
ms @entity24 was also told that the bin 's appearance could ' negatively impact on the street scene environment '			1
facing a fine : @entity7 's wheelie bin juts out just 12 inches from the strip of wood that marks the edge of her property the frustrated householder has attacked the move by @entity37 as ' complete nonsense ' and a waste of taxpayers ' money			1
she pointed out that @entity37 's own grit bins and concrete posts jut further into the road than her bin			1
it has told her to place the bin in the driveway that leads to her garage - but a frustrated @entity24 says it would then block access to her home			1
the teacher , who works at @entity55 and offers private tutoring , says she has nowhere to put the solitary bin other than on the raised concrete area behind her terraced house			2
she has accused the council of using bullying tactics to drag her into court			0
' it is a complete and utter waste of taxpayers ' money , ' she told @entity67			2
' you have no idea how much stress it 's caused me - i 've since been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism and one of the aggravating causes is stress			0
' i have to be down there [ at court ] on a monday afternoon and my students have their a-levels days later			0
i should be there helping my students and instead i 'm arguing over a bin and having my time wasted			2
' @entity83 , the council leader , just got an obe for caring about the people of @entity8			2
@entity24 , a widow since her husband died of motor neurone disease nine years ago , will plead not guilty at the hearing later this month			0
the charge brought under the @entity91 alleges that she failed in the ' placing of receptacles as required for the purpose of avoiding a nuisance or detriment to the amenities of the area '			1
' @entity98 ' : @entity24 , right , says she has faced more than a year of stress over her bin since she was sent the first letter by @entity37 on december 12 , 2011 , right the council says the bin is on ' public land ' and is an obstruction to the highway and to people who are visually impaired or use wheelchairs			1
miss @entity24 says the row goes back to 2011 when she complained about the lid of her recycling box being damaged after it was left in the road by refuse collectors			0
on one occasion , her recycling was not taken away after an empty @entity118 's ice cream carton was found to contain some plastic			0
she and her neighbours , a retired couple , found themselves having to get out of cars to move emptied boxes and wheelie bins			0
in the end , @entity24 asked the council to remove the recycling bins and she has been using a solitary grey wheelie bin for all her rubbish ever since			2
in december 2011 , she received a @entity131 from the council notifying her she had to pay a fine of £ 100 for the ' incorrect presentation of waste receptacles '			2
their target : the council 's letter says the bin could impede to grass cutting - even though there is barely a blade of grass to be seen on the quiet @entity144 inches out of place : the 47 - year - old 's bin has been labelled a potential hazard for disabled people and a blot on the landscape she was told in the summer she could appeal against the fine , which she duly did , and then heard nothing more			1
then , on december 20 2012 , she came home to find a letter telling her that she was to appear in @entity8 on @entity156 over the issues with her rubbish , and could have to pay out up to £ 1,000			1
' because @entity160 was coming up , i could n't speak to anyone at the council or the court			0
it came completely out of the blue and gave me no time			0
' i had lodged my appeal but then heard nothing for months			0
i had made arrangements to go away for the new year and the letter spoilt completely my @entity160 and my holiday because i was so stressed by it all			0
' on @entity156 , she managed to contact the court and her case has been put back			0
she faces a two - hour hearing later this month			0
