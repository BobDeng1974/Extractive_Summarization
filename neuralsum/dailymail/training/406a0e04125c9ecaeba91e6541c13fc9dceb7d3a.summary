scroll down for interactive map and trailer the @entity4 novel famously has a hand drawn map of @entity38 but has now been brought to life and lets people take a tour of the fictional landscape from the air , as well as through a @entity4 ¿ s eyes			1
to enter different locations , users click on the rings , pictured as well as promoting the film the hobbit : the desolation of @entity51 , which arrived at cinemas in december , the interactive map is designed to showcase @entity11 ’s @entity53			1
the map incorporates audio passages from the book and biographies of characters , while there are many scenes that users of the site can seemingly ‘ walk around ’ as well as what seems to be @entity65 music to make the tour a little more magical			0
as well as promoting the film the hobbit : the desolation of @entity51 , the interactive map is designed to showcase @entity11 's @entity53 browser in each location , users of the website can play mini games and battle villains such as the trolls as well as meet wizards and water plants to enter the three locations currently available – @entity79 , @entity28 , which is home to the elves and @entity82 , which is @entity84 's stronghold in @entity85 in middle - earth , - users hover at cloud - level above the map , but once they enter the place it is as if they are the height of a @entity4			1
in any given location , a person can learn the relevance of a place such as @entity28 , an @entity97 outpost in middle - earth , which means ' deep valley of the cleft ' and find out who lives there via an explorable render of the place			2
@entity11 's map is the latest version of the originals ( pictured ) , which were included in the @entity4 and @entity107 novels welcome to @entity28 : at any given location , a person can learn the relevance of a place such as @entity28 , an @entity97 outpost in middle - earth and access character information and a mini game the interactive map is designed to show how fast detailed images like this can load			1
@entity118 is ' the mightiest and fairest of all the elves that remained in @entity38 ' and the ' greatest of elven women , ' @entity5 writes the app showcases computer languages @entity123 and @entity124 , which are designed to work particularly well in @entity11 ’s @entity53 operating system and @entity127 devices			2
in a blog post , @entity128 , a technical expert who was involved in the project , said : ‘ the whole experience is based on a map of middle - earth and the locations and characters from the @entity4 movies			1
' using @entity124 made it possible for us to dramatise and explore the rich world of the @entity4 trilogy and let the users control the experience			2
’ the endeavour showcases computer languages @entity123 and @entity124 , which are designed to work particularly well in @entity11 's @entity53 operating system and @entity127 devices			2
here , the deatil of the graphics is on show in order to escape the clutches of the trolls , users must use a combination of their keyboard and mouse and see the trolls from a @entity4 's point of view the computer scientists used ‘ low - poly models ’ to make sure download time for each scene was not too long , but that graphics still looked as much like the film as possible			1
they found they could increase the complexity ‘ quite a lot ’ without affecting performance too much so that each 3d model of a troll ended up with around 5,000 faces and each scene with around 40,000 faces			0
middle - earth is the fictional setting of @entity4 and @entity107			0
@entity5 's map of middle - earth shows only a small part of the world ; most of the lands of @entity178 and @entity179 are not shown on the map , and there are also other continents			0
middle - earth is meant to be located on our earth in an imaginary period in our planet 's past			0
the @entity189 is meant to be northwestern @entity190 and @entity191 was set at the same latitude of @entity193			0
in the @entity195 , during which @entity5 set the events of the @entity4 , and @entity107 , the @entity198 regions of middle - earth contained the lands of @entity200 , @entity201 , the @entity202 , and the vales of the great river @entity205			0
the term @entity38 - also commonly referred to as middle world - was not invented by @entity5			0
it occurs in @entity209 as a development of the @entity212 word middel - erde			0
@entity5 first encountered the term middangeard in an @entity215 fragment he studied in 1914 : ' @entity216 , brightest of angels / above the middle - earth sent unto men ' , which is from the second of the fragmentary remnants of the @entity223 poems by @entity224 .			0
