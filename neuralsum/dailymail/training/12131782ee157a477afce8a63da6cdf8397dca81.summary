by @entity0 published : 09:19 est , 15 august 2013 updated : 12:15 est , 15 august 2013 hidden away in the cloud forests of @entity3 and described as half cat , half teddy bear , the olinguito is the first new carnivore to be discovered in the @entity7 in 35 years			1
the cute creature has been wrongly identified for 100 years , despite having been spotted in the wild , tucked into museum collections and even exhibited in zoos			2
but now scientists at the @entity13 have confirmed the loveable carnivorous mammal is a new species and have said it is ' an incredibly rare discovery in the @entity18 '			1
weighing 2lb and with woolly orange brown fur , it lives in the cloud forests of @entity3 and @entity35 but for more than a century it was mistaken for its larger close cousin , the olingo			1
an examination of the skull , teeth and skin of museum specimens has now confirmed that it is a different species - the first @entity46 carnivore to be identified in 35 years			0
in a report on the discovery , @entity48 scientists from the @entity49 in @entity50 described the creature 's appearance as ' a cross between a house cat and a teddy bear '			1
compared with the olingo , its teeth and skull are smaller and shaped differently and its orange - brown fur is longer and denser			1
' the discovery of the olinguito shows us that the world is not yet completely explored , its most basic secrets not yet revealed , ' said dr @entity69 , curator of mammals at the @entity13 's @entity71			2
researchers say the olinguito looks like a cross between a house cat and a teddy bear but the furry animals is actually a member of the @entity29 family , along with raccoons , coatis , kinkajous and olingos ' if new carnivores can still be found , what other surprises await us ? so many of the world 's species are not yet known to science			1
' documenting them is the first step towards understanding the full richness and diversity of life on @entity91			0
' the animal 's scientific name is @entity94			0
@entity95 is a genus , or family , of tree - living carnivore that includes several different species , while nebina means ' fog ' in @entity102			2
after identifying museum specimens , the researchers travelled to the northern @entity105 to see if any olinguitos remained in the wild			0
records showed that the creature lived high in the mountains , at elevations of 5,000 to 9,000 feet above sea level and grainy footage from a camcorder video provided a lucky early lead			0
eventually , the team discovered olinguitos living in an @entity35 forest and spent a number of days observing the creatures			2
they learned that the olinguito is mostly active at night , eats fruit as well as meat , rarely leaves the trees , and has one offspring at a time			1
weighing two pounds and with wooly orange brown fur , the olinguito lives in the cloud forests of @entity3 and @entity35 , as its scientific name ' neblina , ' which is @entity102 for fog , suggests			1
the creature is mostly active at night and eats mainly fruit despite being a carnivore but it rarely comes out of the trees the animal 's habitat is under heavy pressure from human development , said the scientists writing in the journal @entity141			1
an estimated 42 per cent of olinguito habitat has already been urbanised or converted to agriculture			0
at least one olinguito from @entity3 was exhibited in several @entity48 zoos during the 1960s and 1970s , the researchers said			2
there were several occasions in the past century when the species came close to being unmasked			0
in 1920 , a @entity152 zoologist suggested that a museum specimen was unusual enough to be a new species , but never followed the suspicion up			0
dr @entity69 said : ' the cloud forests of the @entity105 are a world unto themselves , filled with many species found nowhere else , many of them threatened or endangered			2
' we hope that the olinguito can serve as an ambassador species for the cloud forests of @entity35 and @entity3 , to bring the world 's attention to these critical habitats			1
' this is a beautiful animal , but we know so little about it			0
how many countries does it live in ? ' what else can we learn about its behaviour [ and ] what do we need to do to ensure its conservation ? ' for more than a century the oliguino was mistaken for its larger close cousin , the olingo ( pictured )			0
an examination of the skull , teeth and skin of museum specimens has now confirmed that it is a different species			0

@entity48 scientists said the carnivorous olinguito looks like a cross between a house cat and a teddy bear but is a member of the same family as raccoons
the creature , which has woolly orange brown fur lives in the cloud forests of @entity3 and @entity35 , and is named ' neblina , ' which means fog in @entity102
scientists at the @entity13 said the mammal is most active at night , eats mainly fruit , rarely comes out of the trees and has one baby at a time
