by @entity1 reporter published : 13:25 est , 2 september 2012 updated : 02:20 est , 3 september 2012 crackdown : the new powers have been billed by @entity3 , the @entity4 as ' zero tolerance powers to make it easier for head teachers in @entity8 to sack under performing staff are to be introduced this week			1
they have been billed by @entity3 , the @entity4 as ' zero tolerance			0
' @entity12 will be harsher in new rules will come into from tomorrow			1
the procedure for dealing with under performing teachers will be ' simplified ' and given a shorter minimum timeframe			1
it says in straightforward cases , the process could be completed in nine weeks as opposed to a year - under new ' capability ' procedures			1
only a handful of teachers have been struck off for incompetence over the past decade , suggesting it is all but impossible to get thrown out of the profession			2
between 2001 and 2011 , just 17 of @entity8 ’s 400,000 teachers were prevented from applying for another job after being judged incompetent by the @entity29			2
a three hour a year limit on the amount of time head teachers could spend observing a teacher ’s lessons has also been scrapped , allowing them to go in to classrooms as often as they like to root out low quality teaching			1
but mr @entity3 is introducing a requirement for teachers to be assessed every year against news standards allowing head teachers to monitor lessons as as much as they feel is necessary			1
new rules : powers to make it easier for head teachers in @entity8 to sack under performing staff are to be introduced this week earlier this year mr @entity3 vowed to crack down on what he called the ‘ dance of the lemons ’ , where failed teachers turn up at a new school and get a job by presenting well at an interview			1
‘ it is only after a term or two the head recognises they have taken on a lemon , ’ he added			0
if you are applying for a job when you ’ve been subject to capability procedures , you ’ll have to say so under new legislation			0
‘ the single most important thing in a child ’s performance is the quality of the teacher			0
making sure a child spends the maximum amount of time with inspirational teachers is the most important thing			2
‘ the evidence is quite clear : if you ’re with a bad teacher , you can go back a year ; if you ’re with a good teacher you can leap ahead a year			2
’ the @entity78 reported that out of the 5,000 schools inspected last year , 36 per cent of primary schools and 34 per cent of secondaries were deemed ' satisfactory ” or below			1
the quality of teaching was not good enough in 38 per cent and poor in 3 per cent			0
primary school children will be required to read to inspectors in a shakeup of the @entity12 regime , to ensure by the time they reach secondary school their reading level will be satisfactory			1
@entity92 , deputy general secretary of the @entity93 , told the newspaper : ' no other profession would accept this level of scrutiny and mistrust			0
when news of the crackdown surfaced earlier this year @entity99 , general secretary of the @entity100 , the largest teaching union , said : ‘ this is yet another depressingly predictable announcement from a government seemingly intent on destroying the teaching profession and state education			0
‘ the draconian measures announced today are totally unnecessary			0
there is no evidence which demonstrates that there are problems with the current system			0
‘ this announcement will only serve further to devastate teacher morale and endanger future recruitment to the profession and the retention of existing teachers			0

children of all ages in primary school will read to @entity12 inspectors
teachers could be sacked with 9 weeks instead of a year
