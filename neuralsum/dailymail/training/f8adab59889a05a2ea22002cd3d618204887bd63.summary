by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 07:51 est , 23 november 2012 updated : 08:52 est , 23 november 2012 one senior colleague said @entity3 was on a mission to be the ' most unpopular man in the world ' cabinet ministers are plotting to oust attorney general @entity3 after a series of political blunders			1
senior government figures are furious at ‘ ridiculous @entity11 ’ for his refusal to back colleagues in the battle to stop the @entity15 demanding @entity16 give prisoners the vote			1
@entity19 was also dismayed this week when mr @entity3 took just 40 minutes to dismiss a call from defence secretary @entity21 for a review of the case of @entity25 solider sgt @entity24 , who was jailed for 18 months for keeping a souvenir @entity27 pistol			1
mr @entity21 let slip his fury , when he went on live tv and took a swipe at ‘ tremendously pompous lawyers ’			0
now it has emerged that ministers are so fed up they want mr @entity3 removed from his job			2
one senior cabinet minister said : ‘ it ’s high time we got rid of him - he never seems to be on our side			2
’ another senior colleague said he was determined to make himself the ' most unpopular man in the world '			1
mr @entity3 survived the last reshuffle , but his deputy @entity46 was sacked and replaced by @entity47			0
some @entity48 believe @entity49 mp mr @entity3 could decide to quit on his own terms , after clashes with @entity53 colleagues			1
cabinet colleagues were dumbfounded this week when he moved quickly to pour cold water on efforts by mr @entity21 to help @entity58 's appeal against his jail sentence			2
mr @entity21 wrote to mr @entity3 asking him to look at the case and see if @entity58 's prosecution had been in the public interest			1
but barely 40 minutes after news of mr @entity21 's letter emerged , the attorney general 's office said it would be ' inappropriate ' to intervene			0
the rebuttal was especially embarrassing as @entity58 's wife @entity67 was due at @entity68 that afternoon to meet aides to @entity70 , after she wrote to the prime minister about the case			2
@entity25 soldier sgt @entity24 has been jailed for possessing a ' war trophy ' pistol presented to him by the @entity74 for outstanding service ministers are also furious that the attorney general this week banned them from expressing a view on whether prisoners should be able to take part in elections			1
mr @entity3 said minister must abstain when the crucial vote takes place in the @entity85 next year			1
the law officer has also ruled that the government must not ‘ take a position ’ in the debate by expressing support for a ban			0
justice secretary @entity92 told the @entity93 could ignore fines from the @entity15 yesterday justice secretary @entity92 made clear in the @entity93 his opposition to the @entity97 ruling that prisoners should have the vote			1
he repeatedly stressed that the @entity16 @entity100 is ‘ sovereign ’ and floated the prospect of @entity16 refusing to pay any fines which could be imposed if the ruling is ignored			0
' ultimately if this @entity100 decides not to agree to rulings from the @entity15 it has no sanction , ' mr @entity92 said			0
' it can apply fines in absentia but it will be for @entity100 to decide whether it wishes to recognise those decisions , as it is with all decisions			0
' mr @entity92 replaced @entity111 as justice secretary , who was seen as too pro-european on criminal justice matters			0
but colleagues now think mr @entity3 is a road block to taking a tougher line on law and order			0
‘ he seems to be trying to make himself the most unpopular man in the world , filling a niche previously occupied by @entity111 , ’ said one			1
however , allies insist he is just fulfilling his role as the government 's chief lawyer			2
' he has a lot of support and respect on the conservative benches , ' said a friend .			0
