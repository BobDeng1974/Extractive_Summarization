by @entity0 a web button has been created that scans websites for abusive comments and replaces the negative words with more positive ones			1
for example , angry words such as ' hate ' are replaced with words including ' love ' or ' kittens '			1
the button is a plugin that can be downloaded on the @entity15 or safari browser and was inspired by the torrent of abuse directed to magazine @entity18 after they ran a series of one direction covers			1
an online button has been designed by @entity22 to replace abusive comments on websites with positive ' words of love '			1
it scans for swear words or negative language on @entity29 , pictured , and @entity30 and replaces them with words including cupcake and delicious puppies the @entity18 debacle with one direction fans kicked off on @entity29 earlier this week			1
the bands exclusive interview with @entity18 magazine was classed as ' their most revealing to date ' , but @entity41 's devoted fans were n't happy with how their idols were portrayed			0
@entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 were unveiled as the latest cover stars for the publication this week , with topics discussed in the accompanying interview including bisexual rumours , groupies and their tangled love lives			2
and since the publication of the interview , the magazine has experienced a major backlash from dedicated @entity41 , who bombarded the @entity29 account with a string of foul - mouthed and abusive messages			2
there are similar plugins available already that can block out all mentions of @entity64 , for example , as well as @entity66 or the royal baby			0
it works by using a database of negative and positive words			1
swear words , as well as words such as ' hate ' , ' stupid ' and ' punch ' are classed as negative			1
words such as ' rainbow ' , ' unicorn ' candyfloss ' , ' hug ' and so on are classed as positive words			2
the @entity81 de-troller is part of @entity22 drinks @entity85 ’s @entity84 campaign that uses a comment converter to make internet trolls appear less angry or aggressive			1

a v - hab.com spokesperson said , ' @entity91 , but boy did those poor souls not know what they were getting themselves into ! ' luckily for them , at v - hab we ’re all about countering trolls with a bit of positive energy so we ’ve created @entity81 - hab to take some heat of those poor journalists and try and inject a bit of humour and positivity into what has clearly been a rather large misunderstanding on all sides			2
' not so lucky : @entity18 's @entity29 account was subjected to a barrage of abuse thanks to its @entity41 cover @entity112 has taken the most notable tweets in the original @entity18 article and run them through the anti-trolling comment converter to show what the internet could look like if everyone was just a bit more positive and understanding			0
