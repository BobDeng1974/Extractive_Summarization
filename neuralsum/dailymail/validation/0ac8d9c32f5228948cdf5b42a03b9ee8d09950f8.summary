as @entity3 's season at @entity4 continues to turn sour , the former @entity1 forward is continually being linked with a move away from the @entity6			1
@entity7 and @entity8 have both been credited with having an interest in bringing the world 's most expensive player back to the @entity12			1
@entity13 asked @entity8 fan @entity14 of 90min.com to give his thoughts about a possible switch to the champions elect			1
@entity3 has been criticised by supporters for his performances at @entity4 this season @entity3 performs his trademark celebration as he scored twice during @entity22 ' 3 - 0 win against @entity23 on saturday @entity3 could be available this summer if various transfer reports are to be believed , so naturally @entity8 are being linked with an eye - watering bid - but we have to ask ourselves the question , is he necessary ? on the face of it @entity3 is a good player			1
at @entity1 he dragged an average team out of hole after hole , but it 's easy to be a big fish in small pond			2
as he 's found out in @entity37 it 's much harder in the big pond and that 's what it will be like at @entity8 too			1
overall he 's not had the impact that the world 's most expensive player should			0
there are plenty who would give up everything to have him , but we really do n't need to be wasting time on a player that wo n't be a noticeable improvement , or even fit			0
@entity3 holds his hands to his head after @entity4 were beaten by @entity54 2 - 1 in @entity55 @entity3 leads the wild celebrations after he nets his second of the game against @entity23 in the @entity60 qualifier even with his array of qualities , for the money , @entity3 just is n't worth it			1
as good a player as he is , he was n't worth the world record £ 86m @entity4 paid for him in 2013 , after what was effectively only one explosive season			1
he still is n't worth the £ 75m that the @entity37 giants will allegedly settle for now			0
there 's simply no room for him at @entity8			1
@entity72 already has a plethora of young , similarly able attacking players			0
@entity75 is not as glamorous as the rest , but even he is a crucial part of the team and the fans love him			0
the @entity80 does n't score as many goals or provide as many assists as others , but he is the one above all else that never stops working hard and that type of attitude and passion is more important than everything			0
@entity3 reacts with disbelief after having a goal disallowed during the @entity91 on march 22 after the defeat by @entity54 @entity3 's car was attacked by angry aupporters if @entity3 arrives he is unlikely to do the same and it would negatively change the whole balance of the side which @entity72 has worked hard to build			2
there is also @entity99 to think about			0
the @entity100 has n't shown anything like his best since arriving in january and is n't likely to before the end of the season			2
he is still settling in and just needs a bit more time before fans will eventually see the player that lit up last summer 's @entity109			0
there 's absolutely no point replacing someone before they 've even started			0
@entity3 is being linked with move back to the @entity115 with @entity7 and @entity8 reportedly interested the former @entity1 player attends an event with with young @entity119 and @entity120 children in @entity23 on sunday even just a few games away from claiming a well - deserved @entity12 title though , any @entity8 fan claiming there is no need to improve with summer additions is a fool			1
the season has been far from flawless , but the key areas that need strengthening are defensive			2
if big money is to be spent it has to be used to address real issues , not bringing in additional unnecessary luxury			0
we are more in need of a centre - back , maybe a full - back , @entity138 even , but certainly not @entity3			1
@entity72 has the good sense to see that and @entity3 in blue is highly unlikely			2
besides , if he has any ambition to show himself to be anything other a massive flop , he should reject all offers and do his utmost to prove himself in @entity37			0
