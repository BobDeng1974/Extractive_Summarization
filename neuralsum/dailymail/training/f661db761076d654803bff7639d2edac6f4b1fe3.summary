six children in @entity1 will be given jabs to delay the puberty on the @entity4 because they are convinced they were born the wrong sex			1
the injections - to be administered monthly - will postpone the physical changes of adolescence giving them more time to make decisions about their identity			1
it will also make any sex - change operation far easier should they decide to permanently swap gender			1
gender identity : children often want to wear clothes and play with toys meant for the opposite sex			1
some grow out of it but others become transsexuals as adults ( posed ) they suffer from a rare condition called gender - identity disorder ( @entity27 ) that affects 1 in 4,000 @entity1			1
children often want to wear clothes and play with toys meant for the opposite sex			2
although many grow out of it some will become transsexuals and undergo surgery or take hormones to change their gender			1
the injections will be carried out at a clinic in @entity38 run by the @entity39 and @entity40 as part of an @entity4 trial			2
it will be the first time children of such a young age have ever been given this treatment			2
@entity47 , 11 , who renamed herself @entity48 , is one of the children who has been accepted on the groundbreaking trial			0
according to her parents @entity51 and @entity53 from @entity54 , @entity47 was a tomboy from birth			0
she insisted on wearing boy 's clothes , would cry if placed in a dress , and would only play with toy cards and @entity62 figures			0
her mother was not overly worried but at the age of five , @entity47 asked her : ' when is my willy going to grow ? ' last september , on @entity48 's insistence , @entity51 allowed her daughter to start secondary school as a boy			0
' i feel braver , ' @entity48 told @entity70			0
' boys can be a bit braver than girls			0
' now with puberty looming , his mother agreed to pause the process using drugs			1
' he can not relate to his female body at all , ' @entity51 said			0
' he 's in denial			0
' until now the jabs have only been prescribed to those over 16			0
however , supporters point out that nearly a quarter of sufferers aged 11 to 15 harm themselves or attempt suicide			0
the injections contain drugs called hypothalamic blockers which suppress their sex hormones delaying the onset of puberty			1
in the past ten years they have been increasingly used in countries such as the @entity97 and the @entity98 to give children time to think about their identity			1
however , endocrinologists have expressed concerns that blockers could impact on a teenager 's cognitive abilities and bone density			0
@entity108 dr @entity107 , a psychologist at a specialist children 's gender clinic in @entity111 , believes social conditioning may be playing a part			1
he notes that children can find it hard to think in shades of grey - a boy who likes ' girlie ' things can then assume he is a girl			1
with enough therapy , dr @entity107 believes children with @entity27 can think more flexibly about gender and become comfortable with their birth sex			2
dr @entity126 , director of @entity39 's @entity127 , agrees to some extent			0
she told @entity70 : ' if there were n't pejoratives attached , for example , to boys who prefer more stereotypical girl - type activities and clothes - then it would be so much easier for these children to explore different ways of being without feeling they have to be physically one thing or the other			2
