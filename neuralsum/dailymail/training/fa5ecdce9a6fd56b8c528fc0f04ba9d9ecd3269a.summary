in what researchers are calling a breakthrough in cancer treatment , scientists in @entity1 have produced a new treatment strategy that sees cancer cells killing themselves			1
results of the study , published this week , found that after a short exposure to targeted therapy cancer cells decide to die , promising a new approach to fighting cancer			1
' this discovery is paradigm shifting , ' said professor @entity16 , director , @entity17 with the @entity18 and @entity19 ( @entity20 ) , who conducted the study with the @entity1 's @entity23			2
professor @entity16 has described the discovery of a new way to kill cancer cells as ' paradigm - shifting ' ' in our research , we 're looking for methods that will result in the cancer cell killing itself			1
this would provide an improved treatment and reduce the risk of cancer relapse , ' she said			0
@entity37 , a phd student at the @entity1 who is part of the research team , explains that unlike normal cells , which run their course and then die , cancer cells are not set up to die			1
' the only way to get them to do that is by cutting off their survival messaging , ' she told @entity48			0
there are methods of treatment that cut off survival messaging , however they have side effects , such as chemotherapy , which ' carpet - bombs all your cells '			1
this new development allows treatments to target particular cells			0
' if we can find what â€™s specific about that cancer , we can spare the normal cells , ' said ms @entity37			0
professor @entity16 says this treatment strategy might be effective in treating leukemia as well as reducing the side effects from chemotherapy and the need for ongoing treatment			1
the study examined how blocking certain proteins might affect the death of cancerous cells , a subject that researchers said was ' poorly understood '			0
the researchers found that blocking a protein named @entity79 proved lethal for chronic myeloid leukemia ( @entity81 ) cells , and professor @entity16 said the findings extend beyond @entity81 to all targeted cancer treatments			2
' the activity of @entity79 appears to be a critical determinant of the decision for cancer cells to live or die , ' said ms @entity37			1
' our research has found that by blocking @entity79 in conjunction with exposure to a regular anti-cancer treatment , we were able to more effectively target the leukaemia cells			2
we now also better understand the timing required for the combined treatment to be effective			0
' the results were published in the @entity99 journal			0
the study was conducted at the @entity18 and @entity19			0

researchers in @entity1 have been researching a new treatment strategy
they are *interested* in strategies that get the cancer cells to kill each other
the research could mean reduced side effects as well as shorter treatment
