dressed in a black and white polka - dot dress from @entity29 - which the former @entity7 was previously pictured wearing and subsequently caused to sell out - it is clear that the resemblance is quite striking			1

@entity11 , a former public schoolgirl , takes the whole experience in her stride , politely posing , smiling and chatting to admirers			2
mobbed : the 26 - year - old brunette gets papped by tourists every time she goes out in the royal @entity19 town and even gets id 'd outside @entity31 in case she breaks in under the guise of @entity7 she said : ' it is so much fun being @entity7 's look - a - like and people are so nice and friendly to me all the time			1

double take : dressed in a black and white polka - dot dress from @entity29 - which the former @entity7 was previously pictured wearing and subsequently caused to sell out - the resemblance is quite striking and she said it is now ' weird ' thinking about how she looks so much like his wife			1
however , it does have its downside - especially when she wants to visit @entity31 with friends			0

big change : the 9 - 5 furniture designer can earn up to £ 1,000 per appearance , but has had to turn down some requests @entity11 says she will ' make hay while the sun shines ' , and has no idea how long she will carry on as a @entity0 look - a - like			1
