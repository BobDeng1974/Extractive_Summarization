by @entity0 published : 03:55 est , 7 august 2013 updated : 04:00 est , 7 august 2013 the last year has seen prices for budget airlines soaring , as added fees for checked luggage and allocated seating have become an even more costly caveat to low air fares			1
in many cases , ' low - cost ' flights will match the cost of full - service airlines once these extra charges are taken into account			1
but if you 're planning a long trip and do n't fancy paying through the nose if your bag weighs a whisker over 15kgs ( you 'll pay £ 20 for every kilo you go over with @entity23 ) , help is at hand			0
the budget airlines ' restrictions on baggage have been getting tighter , while charges for going over the agreed weight have been rising steeply @entity30 and @entity23 often offer low starting prices but then add costs on for services such as checking in bags and priority seating @entity36 has launched a service which allows you to bypass the baggage carousel altogether			1
the company , which works with couriers @entity41 , will pick your suitcase up at your door and transport it to your chosen destination , cutting out the need to take bags to the airport altogether			2
pick - up and delivery within @entity50 costs from £ 49 for sports equipment to £ 85 for a 30kg bag , while transporting items to the @entity54 starts from £ 99			1
you can even track your bag along its journey			0
you skip not only check - in , but the fraught weigh - in - and those pesky trolleys with a mind of their own			0
it does n't make sense if you 're just popping to @entity64 for the weekend , but if you 've got a big family holiday coming up and need to bring a ton of stuff with you , you could save yourself money - and hassle			0
jet - setters @entity70 and @entity72 use the service , while @entity74 is a big fan : ' @entity36 picks up the cases from my home , hotel or wherever i am and magically whisks them to the next port of call			1
' this year has seen checked luggage fees soar across the board			0
@entity23 raised the cost of hold luggage from 30 euros to 50 euros ( £ 43.60 ) for the summer			0
chairman @entity85 told a conference in @entity87 this week that charges for checked - in luggage ' will keep increasing until we get rid of the bags '			0
an annual study by @entity93 , the price comparison website , revealed the extent to which budget airlines ' fees for ' optional ' services , including checked luggage , had risen			2

@entity103 's baggage charges have gone up by 47 per cent since 2012 , from £ 15 per person per flight to £ 22 , while @entity30 's equivalent fee has increased by a quarter , from £ 14.50 to £ 18			1
@entity23 , @entity107 and @entity108 have all raised their baggage fees by at least 10 per cent			2
the cost to check in an overweight item of hand luggage has also increased on several airlines : from £ 30 to £ 50 with @entity114 ( up 67 per cent ) , from £ 30 to £ 40 with @entity107 ( up 33 per cent ) , and from £ 130 to £ 140 with @entity23 ( up 8 per cent )			1
the problem is a global one , with the top 15 airlines in the @entity54 collecting baggage fees totaling $ 3.5 billion ( £ 2.3 billion ) in 2012 alone .			2
