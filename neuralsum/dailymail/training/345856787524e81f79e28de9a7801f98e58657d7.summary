up for the cup : @entity1 shows off marks left by cupping as she posed for the photographers on the red carpet , @entity3 star @entity1 looked every inch the a-lister			1
shiny hair , immaculate make - up , a glowing tan — not to mention revealing shorts that showed off her perfectly toned legs			0
but having paid such attention to her appearance , why did @entity1 choose a low - backed top that succeeded only in showing off a series of unsightly circular marks on her back ? peculiarly , @entity1 was modelling the latest celebrity must - have			0
forget @entity21 bracelets and coconut water : every @entity3 star worth her salt knows that their health routine must include cupping			1
for those round marks on @entity1 ’s back are a tell - tale sign of cupping , an ancient @entity32 therapy where heated cups are placed onto the skin , creating suction that supposedly improves blood flow			1
practitioners claim it helps everything from muscle pain to cellulite and depression			0
inevitably , it was @entity44 — that well - known proponent of anti-gravity yoga and elimination diets for her children — who set the trend for cupping when she attended a film premiere in 2004 with the distinctive circular welts clearly visible on her back			1
@entity52 was recently spotted walking through @entity53 with the trademark bruises , and tennis star @entity55 has also declared himself to be a cupping devotee , even though his girlfriend @entity56 said it made him ‘ look like a reptile ’			1
so — apart from leaving you looking like a well - used coaster — how does cupping actually work ? dating back 5,000 years , the therapy is a form of acupuncture , and is based on the idea that suction from the cups draws the skin up and mobilises blood and energy around the body			1
‘ if someone is under stress , or they ’ve suffered a physical trauma like a pulled shoulder , the energy in their body can become stagnated , ’ explains @entity71 , an acupuncturist in @entity72 , @entity73 , and member of the @entity75 , who has been practising cupping for six years			1
miracle cure or celebrity fad : practitioners claim it helps everything from muscle pain to cellulite and depression ‘ cupping enables the blood and energy to move again and travel to the area to begin the healing process			1
‘ it can also have good results if someone is coming down with a cold			0
the suction can help to stop the cold penetrating further into the system			1
’ typically , a flame is first placed inside a glass or rubber cup , so the heat can create a partial vacuum , before the flame is removed and the cup held to the skin for about three minutes			1
although the resulting marks can look alarming , they are temporary , and this kind of cupping should not hurt in any way as the cups used are thick - rimmed and do not heat up			1
other forms of cupping — which costs around £ 50 per session — involve using a sort of suction kit , so no flame is needed			1
the @entity123 ’s leading cupping practitioner is dr @entity124 , a @entity125 holistic doctor who was held in high regard by the late princess @entity127			1
fan : actress @entity44 made an appearance at a film premier in 2004 sporting large circular marks his website recommends cupping ‘ to aid the lymphatic flow , reduce fluid build - up , increase the blood circulation which will help give the skin a healthier appearance and reduce cellulite ’			1
it was dr @entity124 who was responsible for @entity44 ’s introduction to cupping ( ‘ @entity124 is truly special			1
i love him , ’ she has said ) , and other patients include @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145			0
the photographs of @entity1 sparked speculation she may be trying for a baby , as some supporters of cupping say it can be a useful aid to fertility			1
cupping specialist @entity154 says : ‘ there are a number of cupping points on each side of the spine which correspond to organs			2
the most important organ for fertility is the kidney — it ’s the source of life according to @entity166 medicine			0
‘ from the look of [ @entity1 ] , she ’s had cupping in the right spots for fertility treatment			2
the marks are likely to extend right down to her lower back			0
if the patient is in good health and has a good diet — like @entity1 — then cupping fertility treatment can work within about five days			1
it also complements @entity177 treatment			0
’ but mr @entity71 is doubtful			0
‘ i do a lot of fertility treatment and cupping would n’t be my first port of call , ’ he says			2
‘ the location of the cupping marks on @entity1 would indicate some kind of musculoskeletal injury , such as back pain			2
’ and he adds that while cupping is perfectly safe , he would not generally use it on pregnant women			2
‘ it can be a fairly strong treatment , and in pregnancy we like to keep things gentle and light			0
’ in @entity166 , cupping is such an integral part of mainstream medicine that it is practised at hospitals for a variety of conditions			2
the country ’s hugely successful @entity205 swimming squad are regularly photographed with cupping marks , as it is thought to be helpful with muscular pain			2
but while @entity44 and @entity1 are clearly fans , there are plenty of people who think cupping is simply hogwash			2
after the author @entity214 underwent a series of cupping treatments at the @entity217 , she reported : ‘ it feels like 20 14 - year - old boys giving you love bites , but not as much fun			2
i had three or four sessions and i did n’t feel any different — apart from the fact that i wore a burka for two weeks afterwards to hide the unsightly marks			0
why would anyone [ who ’s had cupping ] parade around in a backless dress ? ’ dating back 5,000 years , the therapy is a form of acupuncture , and is based on the idea that suction from the cups draws the skin up and mobilises blood and energy around the body many medical experts are scathing , and warn that fads such as this can become dangerous if people start to use them in place of seeing their gp			1
‘ cupping does n’t make any sense at all , ’ says @entity248 , professor of pharmacology at @entity250			2
‘ @entity253 was part of mainstream medicine in the 18th century , until they found out it was harmful rather than helpful			0
‘ putting a suction cup on the body may cause the skin to constrict and there could be some increased blood flow , but the idea that this could treat any medical condition is laughable			1
‘ it ’s utterly implausible and just another ingenious way of relieving the rich and gullible of their money			0
’ unfortunately , he continues , too many people expect every ailment to be curable			0
‘ there are many medical conditions — back pain being one of them — that we ca n’t do much about , or even find out what the cause is			0
that ’s sad , but spending thousands on something as daft as cupping wo n’t help			0
’ a review of 135 studies on cupping therapy , published last year in the journal @entity286 , found that cupping may be effective on conditions such as acne , facial paralysis and herpes when combined with other treatments such as acupuncture			0
however , the researchers acknowledged that some of the studies in their review may have contained bias , and said more research was needed			0
@entity300 says he has seen significant results from cupping , adding that the technique is almost always used as part of a larger package of acupuncture treatment , which could explain why there may not be substantial research on its effects as an isolated therapy yet			0
however , @entity310 , a leading professor of complementary therapy , has little time for such claims			0
in his book @entity314 ? alternative medicine on trial , he found that despite cupping ’s long history , the only controlled trial on this treatment showed no reduction in pain			0
he added that the fact the skin appears to be sucked into the cup as if ‘ by magic ’ means cupping is likely to generate an ‘ above - average placebo response ’			1
put simply , people are fooled by the seeming wizardry of the suction action into thinking that cupping must be doing something for them			1
professor @entity310 says : ‘ there is no good evidence that cupping helps any condition — except the dreaded condition of celebrities craving attention			0

forget @entity21 bracelets and coconut water , every @entity3 star knows their health routine must involve cupping
