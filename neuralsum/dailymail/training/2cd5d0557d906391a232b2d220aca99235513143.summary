@entity3 developed liver cirrhosis after drinking three bottles of wine every day
excessive drinking has made liver so damaged that fluid - containing toxins and nutrients the liver would normally process - has built up in her abdomen
every three weeks she is admitted to hospital to have it drained off
now her only hope of survival long - term is a liver transplant
@entity3 is one of many people featured on new @entity228 series *highlighting* how alcohol is giving many people in their 20s and 30s the body of a *pensioner*
