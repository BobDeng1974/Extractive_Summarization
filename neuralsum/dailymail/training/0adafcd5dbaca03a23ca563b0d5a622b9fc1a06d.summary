by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 12:03 est , 25 september 2013 updated : 15:40 est , 25 september 2013 he is not performing for another 50 days but obsessively dedicated @entity4 fans in @entity5 have already started queuing to ensure they get the best front row spots			1
about 150 @entity7 in @entity1 put up 17 tents last week to camp out until his november 3 concert at the @entity10			1
the teenage and adult fans take it in turns to sleep in the @entity15 camp overnight to reserve their spot			1
belieber city : dedicated fans have set up camp outside the @entity10 in @entity1 50 days before @entity4 's concert clampdown : police banned under 18s from the camp at night over safety fears and a number of robberies around 50 people were camping out with up to four people bedding down in one tent at a time			1
it had all been planned out with a well organised rota of names and times until @entity1 municipal authority stepped in and clamped down on their plans			1
on monday , officials from the social development department swooped on the tent city to inspect safety and hygiene conditions , and to ban teenagers under the age of 18 from remaining overnight			1
they also ordered the youngsters to return to school or face disciplinary procedures			2
about 30 unaccompanied minors were found staying at the site			2
the authorities immediately threatened to close the camp down and report their parents to social services if the children remained			1
' legal guardians who are not watching their children could have their youngsters taken away from them , ' warned @entity1 municipal social worker , @entity58			1
@entity4 is due to play at the @entity10 on november 3 ' if the camp is considered harmful and those staying there do not abide by our regulations we will dismantle it			1
' city police officers and representatives from the @entity66 also visited the area and instructed fans to take down their stalls lining the pavement along @entity71 during the day as it obstructed pedestrians ’ pathway			1
as a concession for those who remained , the authorities agreed to allow the campers to put up their tents at 9pm every night until 7am the next day			2
according to the @entity66 agents , the camp violates the council ’s code of conduct , which prohibits the installation of shacks on public roads or sidewalks			2
last night the @entity89 visited the @entity91 camp site near the centre of @entity1 and found a depleted base but an enthusiastic bunch of fans who are still determined to sit it out for the 50 day wait until the show			1
only two tents remain , with around eight fans , over the age of 18 , keeping guard of their positions on behalf of 150 other individuals			1
even though it was raining hard and the temperatures had dipped making it a slightly chilly night , the ones settling in for the long haul were undeterred by the hardship of their roadside environment			0
' i ’m certainly not put off by sleeping rough , ' says @entity114 , a 19 - year - old student and the first person in the queue			0
' i absolutely love @entity4 , i identify with his music			0
he inspires me and touches my heart			0
' @entity119 has been instrumental in organising the camp and constantly liaises with the police to ensure that fans are seen to be sticking to the rules			1
he also sorts out the rota of names for the two shifts			0
the day crew starts at 11am until 6pm then hand over to the overnight watch who stay until 11 the following morning			0
the tents have been erected beside the sambadrome 24 hour security kiosk which has two guards in attendance day and night			0
further down the road is the @entity1 military police headquarters			1
despite the close quarters of the security several members of the group were robbed of money and possessions by drug addicts in the early days of queuing			1
organised : fans used a rota so they could take it in turns saving places and looking after possessions day and night while the @entity89 was there , three municipal police officers arrived to check the tents had been put up at the agreed time and only those allowed to stay had remained			1
' we are concerned about their safety during the night as it is not an ideal location to be in			0
it ’s not a dangerous area but i would n’t let my 16 - year - old sleep here overnight , ' says municipal police guard @entity162			1
' we will be driving past regularly throughout the night to keep an eye on them , ' he adds			0
by the time the officers arrived all of the underage fans had gone home			2
one of them is @entity171 , 14 , who said : ' i was devastated when the police banned me from staying at the campsite over night and during the day without an adult			2
' my parents are a little concerned about me being down here but they support me because they know it ’s my dream to see @entity4 and be as close to him as possible			0
@entity178 : the obsessive fans hung a sign dedicated to their idol @entity4 ' from now on , i ’m only allowed to come down on saturdays and my mum or dad has to stay with me			2
' even though they have had quite a few insulting comments shouted by motorists in passing cars the fans say local pubs and restaurants have generously allowed them to use their toilets for a nominal payment of one reais ( 35p ) and bathroom facilities to bathe in for five reais ( £ 1.80 )			2
' the police have actually been really nice to us			2
the other day they bought us pizza and quite a few people have given us food and bottles of water , ' says @entity201 , 19			0
' we also bring our own supplies , biscuits and sandwiches and such like , ' she adds			0
more than 36,000 fans are expected at the concert which is sold out			1
many have paid around 350 reais ( £ 100 ) for their tickets			0
just before the @entity89 leaves , @entity7 treat us to a high - spirited rendition of ‘ boyfriend ’ and declare their undying love for the star			0
' i want to send a message to @entity4 , ' shouts @entity215 , 16			0
' i ca n’t wait to see you			0
i promise i wo n’t faint when i do			0
please marry me ! '			0

about 150 fans set up camp 50 days before the concert on november 3
group takes it in turns to sleep at ' @entity225 ' near @entity1 's @entity10
