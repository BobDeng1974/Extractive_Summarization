@entity0 fights 35 wins 33 wins by @entity2 losses 2 draws 0 having spent a lot of time with @entity6 recently , it 's been difficult to ignore his burning desire to box in @entity9			1
as we all know , anything can happen in boxing , but talks re-opened last week with the @entity15 camp and i am hopeful that a fight can be made in @entity9			2
for @entity6 , it has always been his dream to fight in @entity9 so it is something we will try hard to finalise			1
it had seemingly died in the water , but i took a call from @entity23 on saturday and they wanted to explore the possibilities further			0
i am now expecting to be on a conference call with @entity28 ’s representatives later this week where we will try to make more progress			2
@entity6 , 37 , is close to sealing the dream @entity9 fight with @entity33 @entity15 @entity28 jnr after winning the @entity36 @entity35 bout with @entity37 in @entity38 the 37 - year - old has given thought to retiring since his stunning stoppage of @entity42 in may should this fight go ahead , it will have a knock - on effect on @entity46 , who has earned the right to be mandatory challenger for @entity6 ’s @entity50 super-middleweight world title			1
there are time constraints regarding @entity6 having to face @entity46 and if it 's not possible then you could see @entity6 vacating that belt to free himself up to fight @entity28			1
it would be tough for @entity6 to do that because he knows better than anyone the effort that goes into winning a belt			2
but a @entity9 fight is the guy ’s dream – he desperately wants to fight at the home of boxing and if he gets the chance he will take it			2
if that happens , @entity67 will fight for the vacant @entity50 belt in early 2015 with the winner likely to fight the winner of @entity6 and @entity28			1
that is a fight , assuming it is a unification between @entity46 and @entity6 , which would fill @entity75 next summer			1
as ever in boxing , there are plenty of twists and turns so nothing is certain			0
but i am more hopeful than at any time before that we can make @entity28			0
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... @entity85 shocked even me at the weekend with the way he took out @entity87 inside two rounds			1
everyone around us in the @entity91 was left open - mouthed at what they saw			0
i ’m convinced that only @entity94 of @entity96 ’s stellar heavyweights would match him if they fought today , but more of that later			1
one thing i think people saw on saturday , as was mentioned in the recent @entity103 interview with @entity104 , is that he properly enjoys beating up his opponent			0
he chases them down and just unleashes his strength on them			0
he is a brutal fighter			0
what next ? he will fight @entity110 in november – if @entity110 does n’t get cold feet - and i think a fight with @entity113 , the @entity114 who took @entity116 12 rounds , would be good for early 2015			2
then bring on the @entity118 in a series of huge fights			0
i would suggest he fight the loser of @entity122 and @entity123 , then he can fight @entity124 in the summer			1
after that it would make sense to fight the winner of @entity122 and @entity123 before a massive fight against @entity94			1
for me , @entity94 is obviously a standout above the other @entity96 heavyweights			1
i think @entity85 would beat the rest today			1
as for @entity94 , that would be a tremendous milestone and a huge fight , maybe for the end of 2015 , when @entity85 will be at world level			1
but no - one here is getting carried away			0
@entity85 will earn those chances with hard work and more great performances			2
no - one is more level - headed or determined than him			0
he knows there is a path of great , high - interest fights out there for him			0
he needs to step up and do what he is doing and there will be more great nights			0
@entity85 raises his arms after his stunning victory over @entity87 at the @entity91 @entity153 gestures as he prepares to have his arm raised as the new @entity156 heavyweight champion @entity94 lands a punch on @entity122 ( left ) during their fight in july 2012 , his last competitive bout @entity161 also made a huge impact on our show at the @entity91 on saturday			1
the @entity165 was given no more than a 50 - 50 chance against @entity167 , but barely lost a second of any round			1
he will fight @entity50 featherweight world champion @entity170 before the end of march and who can see him losing ? i ca n’t			1
he had a lot to prove in that ring			0
he was following a stunning performance from domestic rival @entity177 the week before and responded in perfect fashion			2
he is one of the most exciting talents coming through and has the good fortune of an excellent rival like @entity183			0
that is a fight a lot of people are asking me about and it is one i like a lot			0
when @entity161 beats @entity170 – and i ’m sure he will – i ’d like to see him fight @entity183 at @entity190 in summer 2015			1
@entity161 ( left ) dominated @entity167 ( right ) before winning in the ninth round at the @entity91 in @entity192 we have a wonderful show at @entity195 on october 25 and it is bringing @entity196 and @entity197 closer together			2
@entity197 , the @entity198 champion , will fight @entity199 and @entity196 faces @entity200 , one of the most exciting fighters of his time			1
considering the incredible intensity of @entity196 ’s win over @entity199 , i think his fight with @entity200 could be one of the fights of the year			1
people say @entity200 is slowing down but he has been sparring in @entity210 for five weeks and word is he looks very sharp			0
for @entity197 , this is a tough , tough fight			0
@entity199 is a mile further along than his previous opponents and had a fight of the year contender with @entity196 back in february			2
in each case , i see this fight as a perfect marker before a possible fight between @entity196 and @entity197 at the @entity219 in @entity220 next summer			2
we had fun and games at a press conference in @entity226 this week			0
we are taking a show there for the first time in years and can not wait			0
@entity230 will face @entity231 for the @entity36 international middleweight title in an official world title eliminator , while @entity234 will fight @entity235 , @entity236 takes on @entity237 and @entity238 is against @entity239			1
it ’ll be a great night in a city that deserves top - class boxing			0
@entity230 ( to the right of @entity244 , centre ) to fight @entity231 on november 15			0

@entity6 could complete career *bucket* list with a fight against the @entity33
the 37 - year - old thought about retiring since beating @entity42 in may
the fight would likely mean @entity6 vacating his @entity50 super-middleweight world title , as a fight with challenger @entity46 may not fit the *schedule*
@entity85 shocked even me with the way he took out @entity87
@entity198 champion @entity85 would beat @entity122 , @entity124 and @entity123 today
only @entity94 of @entity96 ’s stellar heavyweights would match him
@entity161 proved why he is the @entity165 and i ’d love to see him fight @entity177 at @entity190 next summer
