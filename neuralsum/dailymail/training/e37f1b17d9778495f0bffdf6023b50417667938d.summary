under the deal , approved by @entity11 judge @entity10 , @entity12 , @entity14 - based @entity13 can begin working to recover gold bars and coins from the @entity17 next month			1
' the @entity17 is one of the greatest shipwreck stories of all time , ' @entity18 , @entity13 's ceo , said in a statement			1
' we 're honored to be working with the receiver and his team to share the next chapter of this historically important shipwreck with the world			0
' an @entity11 judge approved a deal to recover the remaining gold from a ship that sank off the @entity6 coast in 1857			1
the ship known as the @entity17 is also known as the @entity17			2
x-marks the spot : the @entity17 sank during a hurricane off the @entity37 coast in 1857 , taking 425 souls and up to 21 tons of gold to the ocean floor specialized searchers : in this 2003 photo provided by @entity13 , the company ¿ s eight - ton remotely operated vehicle , named @entity44 , is launched for a descent to the ocean floor this is an artist drawing of the @entity49 ship @entity17 shown which foundered in 1857 with a loss of 425 lives in a hurricane off @entity53 , @entity6 treasure hunters have located the ship on the ocean floor 200 miles off @entity53 @entity56 : @entity57 organized an expedition to find the epic ship and recover the treasure in 1983			1
he found it five years later in 1988 but there 's still plenty of treasure down there experts hired to conduct a review of extensive historical materials on the shipwreck estimate the 1857 value of the remaining gold on the ship to be somewhere between $ 343,000 and $ 1.4 million , according to @entity13			1
that range in today 's values would be between $ 22 million and $ 88 million if the gold were melted down			1
but the sunken treasure 's worth could be much higher — or lower — depending on the type and amount of treasure recovered			0
for instance , thousands of $ 10 and $ 20 gold coins sold by @entity13 from the @entity82 , which sank off the southeastern @entity83 in 1865 , were sold for an average of about $ 6,700 per coin , said company spokeswoman @entity87			2
that 's in comparison to the current $ 1,349 value of an ounce of melted gold			2
treasures : these gold nuggets , bars and coins from the @entity17 lay on the ocean floor for over 140 years until their recovery in 1987 by @entity83 firm @entity17 @entity100 mission : @entity57 began searching for the @entity17 in 1983 after reading witness accounts of the shipwreck the @entity17 was recovered by @entity11 - based treasure hunters @entity17 using a remote - controlled submarine in 1987			1
the group , led by @entity57 , located the wreck using bayesian search theory , where a number of factors are taken into account direct the search for lost objects			1
significant amounts of gold and other artifacts were then recovered and brought to the surface using another remote - controlled sub built specifically for the recovery			0
after the mr @entity57 announced the find , 39 insurance companies filed a suit claiming they had a right to the gold , on the grounds that they had paid out the damages for its loss in the @entity129			2
the team that found it argued in court that the gold had been abandoned and , after a legal battle , they were awarded 92 per cent of the treasure trove in 1996			0
the total value of the recovered gold was estimated at $ 150million			0
one recovered ingot weighing 80lb sold for a record $ 8million and was recognized as the most valuable piece of currency in the world at that time			0
the expedition to recover the gold is n't the first for the @entity17			2
in 1988 , shipwreck enthusiast and @entity11 native @entity57 led an expedition that found the vessel and recovered gold that later sold for $ 50 million to $ 60 million			1
the treasure then became the subject of lawsuits			0
the litigation involved a group of @entity11 investors who paid $ 12.7 million to fund @entity57 's expedition , but say they never saw any returns and workers who said they were n't properly paid for signing confidentiality agreements to keep the ship 's location and other information secret			1
@entity57 has been described as a secretive @entity165 - like figure by an attorney on one of the cases			0
he has been a wanted fugitive since august 2012 after he failed to show up for a key court hearing and was last seen at a mansion he was renting in @entity171 , @entity14 court records show that @entity13 will advance the cost for the recovery			0
if the company fails to recover the treasure , it will absorb all the costs			0
financial terms of the agreement were not made public , although court records say that @entity11 attorney and businessman @entity181 , who was appointed receiver over @entity57 's companies after he fled , will get more than 50 percent of the recovered treasure , to be disbursed in part to shareholders and the investors who financed the 1988 recovery			1
' @entity192 with historical appeal ' : the gold ingot which is sold at auction for $ 150,000 ' remember , only 5 percent of this ship was excavated ( in 1988 ) , ' @entity196 told @entity0 on thursday			2
" obviously we hope that there is substantial value there and that we can return that value to our shareholders and to the creditors			0
if we can do that after 20 - some odd years , i think it 'd be a job well done			0
" @entity57 remains a shareholder , although it 's unclear how he could claim any of the treasure while he 's still a fugitive			0
' we 're delighted and we hope this is going to turn out to be a very lucrative and profitable venture , ' said @entity214 , the attorney who represents scientists and technicians who allowed @entity57 to find and recover the treasure but said they were n't compensated as promised ' but nobody can tell us with certainty that it will be , and we understand that			0
' the @entity17 was in operation for four years during the california gold rush before it sank after sailing directly into a hurricane in september 1857 in one of the worst maritime disasters in @entity83 history ; 425 people were killed and thousands of pounds of gold sank with it to the bottom of the ocean .			1
