by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 14:03 est , 18 september 2012 updated : 14:03 est , 18 september 2012 a new report warning @entity4 of an imminent obesity epidemic is predicting that by 2030 half the adult population will be morbidly overweight			2
on tuesday , the @entity8 and the @entity9 released a study , based on statistics from the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) , that forecasts a 44 percent rate of adult obesity in every state and a staggering 60 percent in 13 states			1
authors of the report , entitled ' f as in @entity19 ' , are urging the population to act now or face immeasurable economic and health - related consequences			1
on the rise : a new report is forecasting that half the @entity4 population will be obese by 2030 if we do n't do something now to change our eating habits the ' f as in @entity19 ' report also highlights the current glum picture of the @entity4 obesity epidemic , in which 35.7 percent of adults and 16.9 percent of children age 2 to 19 are obese according to @entity12 figures			1
obesity raises the risk of numerous diseases , from type 2 diabetes to endometrial cancer , meaning more sick people and higher medical costs in the future , the report said			1
it projects as many as 7.9million new cases of diabetes a year , compared with 1.9million new cases in recent years			1
there could also be 6.8million new cases of chronic heart disease and stroke every year , compared with 1.3million new cases a year now			2
the increasing burden of illness will go right to the bottom line , adding $ 66billion in annual obesity - related medical costs over and above today 's $ 147billion to $ 210billion			1
total @entity4 healthcare spending is estimated at $ 2.7trillion			0
that projection supports a study published earlier this year in the @entity63 that found that by 2030 , 42 percent of @entity4 adults could be obese , adding $ 550billion to healthcare costs over that period			1
as with all projections , from climate models to @entity71 ' @entity70 , human actions can prevent the worst of the scenarios , according to health policy experts			0
the stats : trust for @entity4 teamed up with the @entity9 to project obesity rates nationwide based on statistics compiled by the @entity12 ' this is a tale of two futures , ' said @entity81 of @entity82 and the executive director of @entity8			1
' we 're at a turning point where if we do n't do something now to mitigate these trends , the cost in human health and healthcare spending will be enormous			1
' obesity is defined as having a body mass index ( @entity94 ) above 30			0
overweight means a @entity94 of 25 to 29.9			0
@entity94 is calculated by taking weight in pounds and dividing it by the square of height in inches , and multiplying the result by 703			0
for instance , someone who is 5ft 5in tall and weighs 185lbs ( 84 kg ) has a @entity94 of 30.8			0
obesity rates among @entity4 adults have more than doubled from the 15 percent of 1980			1
in that same time , they have more than tripled among children			0
since the @entity12 found that the percentage of obese children and adults was essentially unchanged between 2008 and 2010 , some experts question whether the ' f as in @entity19 ' model overstates future obesity by assuming past trends continue in a straight line			1
' this is a strong assumption , ' said economist @entity116 of @entity117 in @entity118			0
' recent evidence from other surveys suggest obesity rates may be leveling off			2
' mathematician @entity122 of @entity124 's @entity123 , a nonprofit group , who led development of the model , said it takes a longer view by design			0
' you have to take trends over a number of years , ' he said			0
' in the age groups that matter , there just is n't much evidence of a leveling off in obesity rates			0
' ' we 're at a turning point where if we do n't do something now to mitigate these trends , the cost in human health and healthcare spending will be enormous ' obesity has long been associated with education and income			1
the report found that about one - third of adults without a high school diploma were obese , compared with about one - fifth of those who graduated from college or technical college			1
and one - third of adults who earn less than $ 15,000 per year are obese , compared to one - quarter of those who earned $ 50,000 or more per year			1
the obesity - poverty connection reflects such facts that calorie - dense foods are cheap and that poor neighborhoods have fewer playgrounds , sidewalks and other amenities that encourage exercise			2
as a result , many states projected to have the most obesity in 2030 do now , too			0
in 2011,12 states had an adult - obesity rate above 30 percent , with @entity170 the highest at 34.9 percent			2
@entity171 was the lowest at 20.7 percent			0
the report projects that in 2030 in @entity170 , 66.7 percent of adults will be obese , as will 44.8 percent in @entity171 , which will still be the thinnest state			1
more surprising are projections for states such as @entity177 , now ranked 19 for obesity with a rate of 28.8 percent			2
the model uses 1999 as a baseline , explained @entity122			0
' so if a state had a low rate of obesity in 1999 and is fairly high now , that indicates a steep rate of increase , which we believe will not go away			2
' result : an obesity rate of 64.7 percent in @entity177 in 2030 , making it the third-most obese state			2
states facing the greatest percentage increase in obesity - related medical costs are now in the middle of the pack			1
@entity196 faces the largest increase in costs , 34.5 percent , as its obesity rate is projected to climb from 23.7 percent today to 48.6 percent in 2030			2
eight other states could see increases of 20 percent and 30 percent , including @entity202 , @entity171 and @entity203			0
@entity8 sees room to change that trajectory with the right interventions			0
' we have learned that with a concerted effort you can change the culture of a community , including its level of physical activity , eating habits , what foods are offered in schools , and whether families eat together , ' said @entity81			0
in @entity221 , for instance , obesity for elementary and middle - school students dropped 5.5 percent from the 2006 - 07 school year to 2010 - 11 , thanks mostly to healthier school lunches , public health experts said			1
' a lot of this is about making healthy choices easier and not mandating healthier lifestyles , ' @entity81 said			0

a new report has been released by the @entity8 and the @entity9 based on stats from the @entity12
rates *expected* to soar as high as 44 percent in every state
currently 35.7 percent of adults and 16.9 percent of children are obese
as many as 7.9million new cases of diabetes a year are forecast , compared with 1.9million in recent years
report found one - third of adults without a high school diploma were obese , compared with about one - fifth of those with college degree
projections will add $ 66billion in annual obesity - related medical costs
executive director of @entity8 says ' we 're at a turning point '
