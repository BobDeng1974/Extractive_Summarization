do n't get me wrong , i am not @entity2 ’s biggest fan , but if @entity3 are to win on sunday then he is going to have a big role to play			1
you would never have believed at the start of the season that he would become @entity3 ’s go - to man but he has knuckled down , worked hard and is now one of @entity11 ’s most effective players			1
here ’s why ... @entity12 2,251 - @entity13 2,241 - @entity14 2,226 - @entity3 @entity3 have played the third-most long balls this season , so this is not the skilful , free - flowing team of previous years			1
but with @entity2 it is an effective tactic			2
he has gone up for 115 aerial duels this season — far more than any other @entity3 man — and @entity23 ’s @entity22 is the only midfielder to win more headers per game			2
his power in the air is vital for providing knock - downs for the likes of @entity30 and @entity31 to collect			0
@entity32 must also track his runs into the box because @entity3 will try to find him as often as they can			1
@entity2 , pictured during training , has gone up for 115 aerial duels this season @entity2 is a powerful player that has become a key part of @entity11 's @entity3 team this season @entity40 one thing is for sure with @entity2 , you know you ’re in a game with him			1
@entity47 , @entity45 and @entity46 are big , physical players but they will have a battle on their hands			0
@entity2 gives away on average 2.1 free - kicks per game — that ’s the fifth - highest rate in the league and shows you what a fighter he is			2
it ’s not pretty , but it unsettles defences			0
@entity3 midfielder @entity2 will not be afraid to get physical with @entity32 's players at @entity60 @entity61 @entity2 's game is not all about power			1
like @entity64 , he ’s portrayed as a bit of a @entity66 when actually his technique is good			0
just look at that controlled finish with his left foot to open the scoring against @entity71			0
he might not be the creative genius to win @entity3 titles , but he has become a useful weapon for @entity75			2
@entity2 lets rip a shot with his left foot as he makes it 1 - 0 against @entity71 at @entity78 @entity2 has been a useful weapon for @entity75 and was on form against @entity71 in @entity3 's 3 - 0 win @entity2 celebrates his goal for @entity3 in this brilliant photograph taken by @entity85 's @entity84 @entity86 it was painful viewing last season seeing @entity2 play in a deep midfield role			1
@entity90 wanted him as protection for his defence , but @entity2 turns like a cruise liner and it was easy for teams to press him			2
playing further forward , it does n’t matter if he loses possession as there is no immediate danger and he can provide an attacking threat of his own			0
@entity2 has been allowed to play further forward for @entity3 under @entity75 , unlike under @entity90 elbow room @entity2 is a real nuisance player			1
he ’s like a daddy longlegs — all arms and legs as he wrestles and grapples to get himself into position			0
he gets his elbows up high , which makes him very difficult to mark , and it ’s hard to get players around him			0
it ’s that physicality that would make me tempted to start @entity112 on sunday			0
not for sentimental reasons , but because he would offer a vital shield against @entity2 ’s threat			0
head and shoulders : @entity2 is @entity75 ’s key player @entity2 has become @entity75 's key player and he will likely be a nuisance for @entity32 on sunday			1

@entity3 face *rivals* @entity32 at @entity60 on sunday
it is a *crucial* *clash* that could *impact* on which club gets a *top* - four place
@entity85 's @entity125 has *analysed* @entity2 's contribution
