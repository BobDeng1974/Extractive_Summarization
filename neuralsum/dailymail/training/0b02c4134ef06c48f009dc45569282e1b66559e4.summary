by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:51 est , 21 may 2013 updated : 17:53 est , 21 may 2013 @entity2 is to stop opening new general stores in the @entity4 amid a shift to internet shopping			1
the company will build four new large outlets over the next three years , but then call a halt to 129 years of bricks and mortar expansion			1
bosses believe that the popularity of ' click and collect ' means people will be buying more online and either collecting from its existing stores or getting home deliveries			1
stopping construction : @entity2 will call a halt to 129 years of bricks and mortar expansion the firm , which was started in 1884 , has opened on average six stores every year in a race to reach as much of the @entity4 population as possible			1
as a result it now has some 766 @entity4 outlets , including 419 of its specialist @entity29 convenience stores			2
but in a sign of the times			2
the chief executive @entity32 said booming sales online mean that the @entity2 store network will have reached saturation and there will be no more new clothing stores			1
' the number of net new stores will be flat due to the growth of dotcom within three years , ' he said			1
' this means that we will continue to maintain the estate by closing some of the older stores and replacing them with new ones in better locations , but we will not be growing our general merchandise chain in the @entity4			2
' the move is in tune with a shift by @entity53 , the big supermarkets and others , which are scaling back plans for new large bricks and mortar outlets			1
@entity4 leads the world in terms of internet shopping , with a greater share and value of spending than any other nation , including the @entity66			2
no new stores : customers look at a food display in the food hall at a @entity2 shop in central @entity72 the @entity2 policy follows that of @entity53 , pictured here in @entity76 , @entity72 however , the other side of that equation is that national chains no longer need a store in every town centre			1
the proposals by @entity2 , which will continue to open small simply food outlets , emerged as the company yesterday revealed a six per cent fall in profits			1
profits for the last financial year were £ 665.2million - taking them well below the £ 1billion plus made as recently as 2008			2
mr @entity32 admitted its fashions ' have not been good enough ' , but he said a new @entity93 / @entity92 collection has been well received			0
despite losing market share to budget rivals such as @entity96 , @entity2 remains the @entity4 's biggest clothing retailer			1
asked about the poor performance in fashion , mr @entity32 admitted : ' it 's been not good enough but still we have got the largest business in the @entity4 by far			0
' he said @entity2 is beating rivals on quality and is now aiming ' to bring something that really delights and surprises the customer '			1
he added : ' secondly , it 's about style			0
we can bring improved style , more trends to customers than we have done so far and where we have done that in our womenswear it has really helped			0
' the company is pinning its hopes of a revival on a new upmarket @entity92 and @entity93 collection devised by the former boss at @entity121 and @entity122 , @entity123			2
the fashion press has welcomed the range , although analysts fear some of the lines will be too expensive for its core customers			0
the womenswear collection includes a @entity4 - made wool double - breasted coat at £ 349			0
a new ' best of @entity4 ' line in menswear includes a grey windowpane check single - breasted wool suit at £ 799 and handmade double monk strap leather shoes at £ 285			0
while the company 's recent record on clothing and general merchandise has been poor , @entity2 has largely been rescued by the success of its food			1
figures published yesterday showed underlying sales of general merchandise in 2012/13 , including clothes , were down by 4.1 per cent , while food was up by 1.7 per cent			0
once , the impact of new stores , overseas and internet sales were added to the equation , total sales were up by 1.3 per cent			0
despite this small increase , underlying profits fell from £ 687.2million to £ 665.2million			0
city analysts were not surprised by the bad news and suggested the pressure is on mr @entity32 to deliver an improvement or move on			0
@entity159 , director of consultants @entity160 , complained : @entity162 & @entity163 seems like a rabbit in the headlights			0
however many operational improvements it makes , it 's all immaterial unless the retailer can rediscover its panache			0
