@entity9 treated managers from @entity12 supermarkets across @entity13 to a five - day company conference at the home of @entity16			1
but @entity18 officials say the trip was a ‘ benefit in kind ’ for the staff and are demanding that @entity12 pays £ 2.5million in tax			1
wish you were here ? @entity12 staff enjoy a day out at @entity4 in @entity5 during a ' conference ' paid for by the company which @entity18 now claims must be taxed to the tune of £ 2.5million mr @entity9 is furious and refusing to pay up , arguing : ‘ we did it because it ’s an investment			1
@entity4 is the no 1 in the world for customer service			1
we ’re exposing our staff to world - class customer service , and if just 10 per cent of it transfers back home , it will be worth every penny			1
‘ it was fun and i ’m not apologising for that			0
having fun has been a key factor in driving what we ’ve achieved at @entity12			0
’ mr @entity9 , 66 , flew his team of managers to @entity5 for a £ 4million conference , including shows and day - trips to the @entity4 resorts , in 2009			1
but four years later the taxman insists the trip was little more than a free holiday for his workers			2
mr @entity9 , who set up @entity12 in @entity54 , @entity55 , argued that the £ 5,000 - a - head theme park tour was a business expense designed to give his senior staff an insight into the heights of customer service at @entity4			1
but @entity18 officials say the trip was actually a reward for staff , and therefore a taxable benefit			1
refusing to pay up : @entity12 boss @entity9 ( left ) argues that the five - day your , which included rides at the theme park ( right ) and visits to the @entity72 , was a business expense and should not be taxed mr @entity9 added : ‘ at @entity12 , our biggest single strategic decision has been to focus on looking after our colleagues , ensuring that they are happy and motivated			1
the logic is that they , in turn , will look after our customers well and that will drive sales and profits			0
‘ at @entity12 , we believe in fun			0
we must be doing something right because we were named by @entity84 as the @entity85 to work for in the @entity13			0
’ @entity12 has 776 stores employing 23,000 staff across @entity13 – taking on the big supermarkets such as @entity89 , @entity90 ’s and @entity91			0
proud : mr @entity9 addresses his 800 staff on the trip which he described as the ' highlight of his career ' benefits in kind are goods and services provided to an employee for free or at greatly reduced costs			1
they are sometimes called ' perks ' or ' fringe benefits ' and can include company cars , private medical insurance paid for by the employer or free loans			0
some will be taxed only for people who are not in lower paid employment , while others are applicable to everyone			0
the tax is based on the cash equivalent value of the benefit			0
the employer will pay @entity117 on these , while the employee will pay income @entity119 : @entity18 / @entity122 / @entity121 mr @entity9 – who says @entity12 has paid £ 513million in tax over the past eight years – added : ‘ we have invested millions over the past seven years in giving our store managers and head office staff the best conferences money can buy			1
‘ these are unique , mind - blowing events that bring them back to the business buzzing and hungry for more success			2
‘ you might think that the government would be keen to learn from this success			0
instead , they seem determined to do their utmost to snuff out the fun in business by taxing as a benefit any kind of corporate event that might be considered enjoyable			2
’ @entity18 refuses to discuss individual tax affairs , but offers advice to companies on staff outings			2
it says overseas trips ‘ variously described as conferences , conventions or seminars are often no more than incentives intended to reward past performance or to motivate employees for the future ’			0
on its website , @entity18 warns that tax collectors will look out for trips where ‘ the itinerary will consist largely of social occasions , excursions and leisure activities ’			2
it adds : ‘ no deduction should be permitted for the cost of such trips			0

@entity9 argues that £ 5,000 - a - head tour was a business expense
five - day trip included shows , rides and trips to @entity72
