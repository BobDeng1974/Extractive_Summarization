from the 793 attack on @entity5 monastery that left the surrounding sea red with blood to the pirate raids so vicious @entity10 king @entity9 was forced to pay a yearly tribute to keep them away , the mention of the word @entity2 was once enough to strike terror into the stoutest of @entity16 hearts			2
but the battling @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 were n't just ferocious bearskin - clad warriors			0
as a new book , @entity2 : the @entity23 , reveals , the @entity25 raiders also had a surprisingly creative side			1
along with huge caches of elaborately worked swords and jewellery , the period also yielded stunning tapestries , pottery and carving - including some that was executed not by the men , but by women			2
terrifying sight : a period drawing depicting a shipload of @entity2 warriors heading out to sea in a longship stunning : a beautifully made silver brooch depicting @entity44 ( left ) and a carved animal head unearthed in @entity19 among the most stunning are the @entity49 tapestries , a collection of intricately detailed works that depict a mixture of @entity54 and @entity23 gods , all of which appear to be moving towards a vast ash tree thought to be @entity56 - believed to hold nine worlds in its branches in @entity60			1
the works , which are thought to date from between 800 and 1100 , were created using wool , a textile common in the @entity2 world , and dyed using plants found in the surrounding @entity18 countryside			2
but while the tapestries prove that the @entity71 had a sensitive side of sorts , most of the creative efforts of the period went into producing one of two things : elaborate boats and status - enhancing jewellery			1
and it was the elaborate longships that were the first part of @entity2 craft to appear in the @entity82 , when they appeared off the @entity85 coast in 793			0
life meets art : this scene from the @entity49 tapestries depicts one of the @entity2 's famous longships worship : among the scenes included in the stunning @entity49 tapestries is this one which shows @entity56 elaborate : treasure , including brooches and bracelets from a large hoard discovered in 1868 at @entity101 fiery portents , a dragon seen streaking across the @entity105 sky and whirlwinds lashing the coast could mean only one thing to the fearful @entity10 watching the heavens in 793 - doom was imminent			1
and doom duly came in the shape of the @entity71 , who between 793 and 1066 were a hazardous part of life for the @entity10			0
beginning with the @entity5 attack , their power and influence grew until by 849 , the year @entity116 was born , they held much of the north and east			0
although he managed to halt their advance , raids did n't cease until after the @entity125			0
and while the @entity71 may be gone from @entity82 shores , their influence does live on in the @entity16 language			0
@entity130 , which means murderous rage , comes from the @entity10 ' beserker ' or clad in bear - skin - an early term used to describe the @entity71			0
although the sight of an elegant @entity2 ship on the horizon usually meant a grisly end for the unlucky @entity10 watcher onshore , the ships also carried carvings created by some of the finest craftsmen of the age			1
carved wooden prows were a key part of the adornment lavished on @entity2 ships , and many featured animals			2
one of the most stunning examples of the former to be found in author @entity153 's book , is the animal headed post which once adorned a @entity2 ship			1
the work , which was found in the @entity158 on a farm near @entity160 in the @entity19 @entity162 region , is a stylised wooden carving of a dog , its mouth open in a ferocious growl , and its neck beautifully decorated with scroll - work			0
but while adorning ships was an important strand of @entity2 art , personal adornment proved just as satisfying for @entity2 craftsmen			2
among the incredible examples of @entity2 jewels to appear in the book , is an elaborate silver brooch , now tucked away in a @entity179 archive , depicting @entity44 , the king of the @entity23 gods			1
there 's also a hoard of silver and gold treasure , discovered near @entity184 in @entity185 , that includes striking examples of elaborately detailed brooches depicting everything from country life to the bloody raids that so terrified their @entity10 neighbours			0
@entity2 : the @entity23 ’s manual by @entity153 costs £ 12.95 and is published by @entity193 workplace : most @entity2 art was created in the cosy confines of homes such as this one in @entity198 in @entity199 spectacular : as the @entity204 , found in a burial mound in @entity19 , reveals , art and war went together intricate : this silver gilt pot , discovered near @entity206 , displays the @entity2 aptitude for design familiar : the warriors seen in the history channel 's @entity2 drama series are the bloodthirsty beserkers of old			1

most of the @entity71 ' creative urges went into ships and jewellery design
they also created *religious* works such as the @entity49 tapestries
other works include brooches showing @entity23 gods and ship carvings
