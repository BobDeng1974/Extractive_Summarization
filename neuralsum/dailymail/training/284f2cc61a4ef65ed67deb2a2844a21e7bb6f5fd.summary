by @entity0 published : 12:24 est , 11 july 2013 updated : 12:25 est , 11 july 2013 a @entity2 spacecraft has caught a glimpse of something we 've long suspected was there , but could never see - the tail of our solar system			1
scientists have long predicted that our solar system has a tail much like a comet , as it moves through space causing a stream of particles to trail behind it			1
but now their theory has been proved correct after @entity2 's @entity17 ( @entity17 ) spacecraft has mapped the first view of the tail , which follows the heliosphere , or our solar ' bubble '			1
a tail of particles flows to the right of the heliosphere			0
the elongated shape in light blue is the outer heliosphere , the region where the sun still has a small amount of influence our solar system can be likened to a meteor traveling through @entity46 ’s atmosphere , which causes the particles to form a stream trailing off behind it			1
@entity17 has mapped the boundaries of the tail of the heliosphere , something that has never before been possible			2
scientists described this tail , called the heliotail , in @entity56			0
by combining observations from the first three years of @entity17 imagery , the team mapped out a tail that shows a combination of fast and slow moving particles			1
@entity2 said that there are two ' lobes ' of slower particles on the sides , faster particles above and below , with the entire structure twisted , as it experiences the pushing and pulling of magnetic fields outside the solar system			1
' by examining the neutral atoms , @entity17 made the first observations of the heliotail , ' said @entity74 , lead author on the paper and principal investigator for @entity17 at @entity77 in @entity78 , @entity79			2
' many models have suggested the heliotail might be like this or like that , but we ’ve had no observations			0
' we always drew pictures where the tail of the heliosphere just disappears off the page , since we could n’t even speculate about what it really looked like			0
' telescopes have previously spotted similar tails around other stars but it has been difficult to see whether our star also has one			0
scientists came close to viewing it before when @entity97 crossed the orbit of @entity99 in 1983 , but annoyingly it lost power 20 years later before it moved into the tail			2
@entity17 however , maps regions by measuring neutral particles created by collisions at the heliosphere ’s boundaries			0
@entity108 , @entity17 mission scientist at @entity2 ’s @entity109 in @entity110 , @entity111 , said : ' using neutral atoms , @entity17 can observe far away structures , even from @entity46 orbit			2
' other stars show tails that trail behind them like a comet ¿ s tail			0
scientists used @entity119 s @entity17 to confirm that our solar system has one too			1
from top left and going counter clockwise , the stars shown are : @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 ' @entity17 scans the entire sky , so it has given us our first data about what the tail of the heliosphere looks like , an important part of understanding our place in and movement through the galaxy			2
' scientists are using the map to try and understand more about the charged particles that form the heliotail and the solar wind that blows out from the sun. ' the tail is our footprint on the galaxy , and it ’s exciting that we ’re starting to understand the structure of it , said professor @entity108			1
' the next step is to incorporate these observations into our models and start the process of really understanding our heliopshere			0
' scientists can test their computer simulations of the heliosphere against the new observations and improve their models			0
together , data from instruments in space and analysis at labs on the ground will continue to improve our understanding of the comet - like tail streaming out behind us			0
this data from @entity2 's @entity17 shows what it observed looking down the solar system 's tail			1
the yellow and red colours represent areas of slow - moving particles , and the blue represents the fast - moving particles			1

@entity2 's @entity17 ( @entity17 ) has caught a glimpse of the tail of our solar system as it travels through space
by combining 3 years worth of observations , @entity185 scientists have mapped a tail that shows a combination of fast and slow moving particles
they believe that the tail is ' our footprint on the galaxy ' and that the map will help us better understand the structure of our solar system
