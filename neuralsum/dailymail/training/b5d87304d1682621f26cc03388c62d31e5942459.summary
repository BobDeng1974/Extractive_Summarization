historic day : proud mother @entity18 with her new born baby @entity6 , the first child to be born on @entity8 in the @entity9 since 1937 distant idyll : @entity8 is one of the most distant parts of the @entity5 and has 73 people living there permanently , half the population there 150 years ago pregnant women living on the islands normally travel to @entity29 's , the largest of the islands , or @entity31 to give birth as there are no doctors or hospitals on @entity8			1

the last person to have been born on @entity8 was @entity41 , 76 , who moved from the island several years ago			1
delighted @entity18 said : ' it was absolutely fantastic and went exactly how we wished it to			2
' it felt extra special being able to give birth to our little girl on the island which we plan to bring her up on			1
' because my first labour was so quick we thought it would be best to plan the birth at home as we would have had to get a helicopter to the hospital on the mainland			1
' it 's really fortunate we did as there is no way we would have been able to get to the mainland in time for @entity6 to be born			1
' she 's a beauty : @entity6 is the first child born on the island since the 1930s after her mum opted for a home birth and a midwife who sped there by boat all change : a pregnant @entity18 and partner @entity74 with their son @entity38 on @entity8 , which now has 73 people living on it growing family : @entity6 's big brother @entity38 keeps a protective eye on the one - week - old little girl one of the five inhabited islands that make up the @entity9 , @entity8 is an archipelago 28 miles off @entity85 - the most @entity88 @entity87 point of the @entity89			1
its gloriously mild weather , bracing pollution - free sea air and abundant flora , all thanks to the nearby path of the @entity92 , make it one of the nicest places to live the @entity5 @entity8 , a small flower farming community , is completely untouched			2
birds , butterflies and wildflowers abound practically all year round here , including many rare species not found elsewhere in the @entity5			0

its most famous landmark is the lighthouse ( pictured ) which has been keeping shipping safe since 1680			0
she went into labour while having a bath on october 5 and she called her fiance @entity118 , an electrician , who took her into the living room			0

@entity6 was born on the couple 's living room floor at around 1pm on october 5 weighing a healthy 7lb 12oz			2
stay at home @entity128 said : ' we thought at one point that @entity131 would have to deliver the baby himself as everything was happening so fast			0
' but we had a home birthing kit ready and @entity120 told @entity131 exactly what to do so we felt fully prepared			0
@entity118 was fantastic and managed to stay very calm until @entity120 got to us			0
' it felt so special to give birth at home as it meant @entity38 was able to come over straight after to meet his little sister			1
' @entity131 was bought up on the island so has a lot of family here who were also able to meet @entity6 very soon after birth			2
' @entity18 is originally from @entity147 and the engaged couple met when @entity18 got a summer job on the island aged 16			2
the tiny island of @entity8 is the southernmost populated island of the @entity9 and is only one mile long			2
