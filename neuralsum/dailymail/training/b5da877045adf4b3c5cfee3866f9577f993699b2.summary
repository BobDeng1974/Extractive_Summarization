and the number who think the government will collapse early has doubled in a fortnight as the @entity11 and @entity12 continue to squabble in public , a new poll has revealed			1
it is more bad news for @entity15 and @entity16 , who have fallen out over reforming the @entity17 and constituency boundary changes			1
confidence crisis : only one in six voters now believe the @entity1 will survive to may 2015 because @entity15 and @entity16 continue to squabble the two leaders are continuing to stick together on the economy , but if they were to row over that then it could spell the end for the partnership			2

this has halved from the 33 per cent who thought this when asked the same question two weeks ago			0
meanwhile the number who think it will last to a few months before the 2015 election has also dropped from 23 per cent a fortnight ago to 19 per cent			0
and 43 per cent think it will implode in the next two years - double the 23 per cent who though this in late july			0
happier times : prime minister @entity15 with deputy prime minister @entity16 at their first joint press conference in the @entity43 of @entity44 in may 2010 one in ten think the @entity11 / @entity12 pact will break up even quicker			1

guests : chancellor @entity64 and @entity11 treasury minister @entity11 were also invited to the ' clear the air ' dinner on friday night in an interview with @entity81 , mr @entity15 said mr @entity16 was wrong to oppose moves to reduce the number of @entity84 and address the growing imbalance in the number of voters in each constituency			1
