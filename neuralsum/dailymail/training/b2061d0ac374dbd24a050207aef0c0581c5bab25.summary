everywhere you go you run the risk of leaving traces of your dna behind – from fingerprints , to skin , hair and cigarette butts			0
a @entity9 - based firm is so concerned this dna could be collected and stored by authorities it has created a range of sprays designed to help people delete it from all surfaces			1
a limited number of @entity19 sprays are due to go on sale in june for $ 99 ( £ 58 ) to protect people ’s privacy , but , in theory , it could also be used by criminals to commit crimes without getting caught			1
the @entity32 spray , pictured left , is said to remove 99.95 % of dna from surfaces , while @entity35 , pictured right , removes the final 0.5 % by mixing it with other genetic material the @entity19 range consists of two different sprays that can be used as a pair , or separately			1
the first is called @entity32 and it ’s an ‘ @entity42 cleaning product ’ similar to a disinfectant spray			2
while @entity35 is an obfuscation spray that adds a mixture of genetic material to a dna sample to cloak the details of the original			1
this means customers can either wipe everything clean , or leave an alternate dna sample to protect their privacy			0
the @entity19 range of sprays was created by genetic privacy company @entity30 , set up by artist @entity29			1
last year , @entity58 set up the @entity60 exhibition in which she created realistic 3d portrait sculptures of strangers using dna she collected from public places			2
according to the @entity30 sites , @entity19 is a set of sprays that can be used to remove or obfuscate a person ’s residual dna left on door handles , keyboards , train seats , or in restaurants and pubs			1
the first spray is called @entity32 and it ’s an ‘ @entity42 cleaning product ’ similar to a disinfectant spray			2
' replace ' , on the other hand , is an obfuscation spray that adds a mixture of genetic material to a dna sample to cloak the details of the original			1

@entity30 ' website claims the product goes on sale in june for $ 99 ( £ 58 ) and customers can use it to wipe everything clean , or leave an alternate genetic sample to protect their privacy this means customers can either wipe everything clean , or leave an alternate dna sample to protect their privacy			1
the site does , however , feature endorsements from genetic experts including @entity100 , @entity101 who said : ‘ no - one should be able to take another person ’s dna without consent and mine it for information			2
‘ the promises of the genetic revolution will not be fully realised if concerns over unauthorised testing of dna and its misuse are not addressed			0
@entity19 represents a critical step towards achieving that goal			0
’ this graphic reveals that the average person sheds 50 strands of hair each day and each strand contains five nanograms of @entity42			0
only 0.5 nanograms of @entity42 is required for standard forensic analysis last year , @entity58 set up the @entity60 exhibition , pictured , in which she created realistic 3d portrait sculptures of strangers using dna she collected from public places @entity30 continued : ‘ genetic information is inadvertently discarded by billions each day through shed hairs and lashes , dropped cigarette butts and gum , or saliva left on glasses and silverware			1
in addition to being accidentally discarded , @entity42 is routinely extracted and often stored from infants at birth , and as criminal dna databases are expanding exponentially			0
‘ law enforcement now routinely profiles individuals convicted of even petty crimes , tending toward permanent storage of both profiles and biological samples from individuals arrested for but never convicted of a crime			0
’ commenting on the spray , dr @entity147 from @entity148 told @entity150 : ' it is easy to remove dna with a good clean , with biological washing powder for example			2
' i ca n’t see any implications for criminal investigation as this would require a criminal to spray around after themselves cleaning up			0
' given that , today , criminals still do n’t wear gloves i ca n’t see this being effective			0
' i think its cashing in on the ‘ hype ’ surrounding dna analysis and the ( unjustified ) fear that people have that it will be used for non-criminal investigation purposes			0

the invisible sprays have been created by artist @entity29 - @entity29
the @entity32 spray claims to remove 99.95 % of dna from surfaces
' replace ' removes the final 0.5 % by mixing it with other genetic material
