by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 28 september 2013 updated : 16:00 est , 28 september 2013 think of @entity2 grub and you may imagine tasteless , depressing stodge that would be best avoided			1
but , in fact , many military recipes are carefully developed to be easy , cost - effective and nutritious			1
a new book , @entity8 , revisits @entity10 military meals since the @entity11 , revealing dishes and ingredients that nowadays rarely grace our dining tables			2
yet as a nutritional therapist , i can see how many of these meals do have a place in a modern healthy diet			2
rations : a typical selection of ingredients provided in wartime from which a cook would have to provide a nutritious meal the book ’s author , @entity28 , recalls that @entity30 said : ‘ an army marches on its stomach			1
’ well , that applies to anyone who battles through daily life – these recipes reflect our need for good - quality sustenance			2
among the meals ’ merits are a high provision of protein , fibre , vitamins and minerals			0
for example , just one serving of @entity48 – named after a wartime minister of food – provides an incredible four vegetable portions			1
these meals are comforting , with such homemade appeal that children will love them			0
they demonstrate not just the practical side of @entity2 food – such as that wartime staple corned beef – but also the creativity rationing inspired			1
@entity62 recalls the days when sugar was scarce			0
people still wanted something sweet so turned to carrots instead , as they have a natural sweetness			0
today you can use the recipe to make healthier treats for children			0
here i introduce five of my favourite low - cost wartime dishes from the book and explain why they deserve a place in your repertoire of recipes ... @entity8 , by @entity28 , is published by @entity79 , priced £ 14.99			1
