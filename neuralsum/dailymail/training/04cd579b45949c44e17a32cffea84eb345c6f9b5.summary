@entity1 head to the @entity2 and a game at @entity4 on monday night with manager @entity5 hoping for a performance and a result that will kick - start his reign at @entity9			1
the @entity11 coach has said he needs a result similar to the @entity14 win at @entity15 that suddenly fired his @entity17 team in to life in december 2009			0
the @entity19 may seem a long way from the @entity21 in @entity22 but if @entity24 is to see his new team produce the first comprehensive performance of his time in the @entity28 then here are five things that must happen			2
@entity30 celebrates after scoring his first goal for @entity1 to secure a win against @entity33 @entity34 after years of seeing @entity1 snatch results at the end of games , the reverse has been true this season			1
sir @entity40 revealed last year that his @entity1 teams actually used to practice scoring late goals in training			2
@entity24 's players , though , do n't seem to be able to play beyond an hour , having failed to score a single goal after 63 minutes in any competition all season			1
@entity48 lifts a weight in training as @entity1 's players work on their strength and fitness their last two home games – wins against @entity33 and @entity56 – saw @entity1 hanging on at the end , saved by goalkeeper @entity58 and a linesman 's flag in those matches			2
whether it is a psychological issue – indicative perhaps of a lack of confidence – or something to do with physical fitness , it is hard to say			0
@entity24 's messages regarding his training sessions have been contradictory though – saying last friday he has had to lower the intensity at @entity71 – and he needs to find a way to get 90 minutes out of his players tonight			0
@entity5 ( left ) and @entity74 are yet to see @entity1 score after the 63rd minute this season @entity77 @entity76 when @entity83 dived to head in @entity86 's equaliser in their opening @entity88 game against @entity89 back in june , the bond between the @entity1 striker and his coach for club and country seemed clear			1
since then , though , @entity83 has done little to suggest a return to the scoring heights of his first @entity1 season two years ago is imminent			1
he has not been dreadful this season , far from it			0
he has scored two @entity28 goals , which is only one less than @entity95 and is one more than @entity30			1
@entity96 has only netted two goals in six @entity28 appearances under @entity5 however , the @entity11 is not the free - running irresistible force of two years ago and it is tempting to wonder if he would actually start on monday night were @entity95 not suspended			1
rumours persist of ongoing problems with @entity83 's knee while an argument with team - mates during last week 's @entity86 win over @entity107 saw him criticised by former captain @entity108			0
as we know , @entity83 likes to be the star of the show			0
time to show that he deserves to be , perhaps			0
@entity83 ( second from left ) is congratulated by his team - mates after scoring against @entity114 @entity115 @entity24 is nothing if not honest and recently he hinted at a modern @entity1 issue when he said : ' i want to improve so we do n't lose the ball so easily			2
that is our problem , not our defence			0
we are easily losing the ball but that is also the character of our team because we have a lot of creative players and they need more discipline			0
' the days of @entity1 smothering opposition with possession seem a long time ago now			2
@entity134 ' team certainly did n't do it and even the latter years of the sir @entity40 saw @entity1 play much more counter attacking football than they wished			1
@entity30 , pictured tussling with @entity137 , may not be used to his defensive duties at @entity9 just yet now that @entity1 have a team packed with ball players , it should n't be that difficult but one wonders if the likes of @entity30 , @entity144 and @entity48 are prepared to do as much work in their own half as the @entity28 tends to ask			1
after all , the first things good teams – really good teams – tend to do when they lose the ball is get it back again			0
@entity151 screen @entity1 are away from home on monday night and that usually dictates that a team will have to spend some time in their own half			1
@entity4 may not be the most glamorous or talked - about team in the @entity28 but they are quite happy to get on the front foot in front of their own supporters and that will certainly be the case early on at @entity19			1
when that happens , @entity1 need to find a way to screen the back four			2
with @entity24 playing so many attacking players each week , the demands on more defensively - minded players like @entity167 simply increase			0
@entity167 ( right ) , pictured in action against @entity170 , has impressed in a defensive midfield role so far blind looks to be an exceptional purchase so far , a hard - working , intelligent player who buys in to the team ethic naturally and is happy to do his bit without the need for fanfare			1
however , against the @entity4 he will need some help from whoever players alongside him			2
ideally it would be @entity183 , who brings some height and physicality to the role			0
however he is not quite fit so if the @entity188 @entity187 is pressed into action despite the pain of his rib injury he will need to sacrifice a little of his naturally offensive tendencies to help protect what continues to be a rather uncertain @entity1 back four			0
@entity187 may need to play a more defensive role against @entity4 at the @entity19 keep the angel flying with @entity95 serving the second game of his suspension and nobody sure what we are going to get from players like @entity83 and @entity48 , it is imperative that the talented @entity144 continues his good form			1
@entity144 has taken to life in the @entity28 without breaking stride and his performances for @entity24 have been a consistent bright spot of @entity1 's rather up and down season so far			1
@entity144 has three goals and three assists in five @entity28 appearances for the @entity212 the great thing about a free - running forward like @entity144 is that he attracts players to him when he has the ball – and to a lesser degree when he has n't – and that spreads uncertainty in a defence and , of course , leave spaces open for other players to exploit			0
@entity1 have n't really had anything like this since @entity226 left and the similarities between the two players are clear			0
@entity226 could be devastating away from home as @entity1 flew at teams on the counter and @entity144 can be the same in the @entity2			1

@entity4 host @entity1 at the @entity19 on monday night
@entity1 have not scored after the 63rd minute in any game this season
@entity96 has failed to hit form and @entity95 is suspended
@entity167 has impressed but needs a midfield partner to play alongside
@entity144 must continue his *excellent* start to life at @entity9
