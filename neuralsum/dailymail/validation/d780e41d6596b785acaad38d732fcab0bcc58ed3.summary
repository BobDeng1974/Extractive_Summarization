moments after announcing his imminent change of codes , @entity0 was asked if he had ever played a game of rugby union before			1
‘ no , ’ he said , emphatically			0
there was a pause , as if the league icon was trying to fathom whether the question had been a joke , before he added : ‘ they do n’t play much rugby union in @entity13			0
’ that is undoubtedly true , but the current @entity16 fly - half , @entity17 , also grew up in the @entity19 town , as did his @entity21 team - mate , @entity20			2
@entity22 captain @entity0 is to switch codes and join @entity24 at the end of the season @entity0 ( centre ) lifts the @entity29 trophy after @entity22 beat @entity30 in the grand final in october 2012 now , at the age of 34 , @entity0 is aiming to follow those younger converts across the rugby divide , having opted to leave @entity22 at the end of their season , to join sister club @entity24			1
the former @entity16 captain is a record - breaking legend in the 13 - man game , but he wanted one last career challenge ; a late shot at union			2
‘ it ’s something that excites me and i ’ve wanted to do for a long time , but i never thought that i would get the chance to do it , ’ he said , shortly after informing his @entity22 team - mates of his impending move			1
‘ the club has set targets to get back to where it belongs in the @entity52 and that is something i want to be part of			2

@entity0 is tackled during a match between @entity22 and @entity63 last year @entity0 ( left ) in action for @entity16 against @entity65 during the @entity67 quarter - final ‘ i ’m very respectful of the game ( union ) and i like watching it			1
a lot of rugby league people look down on union and a lot of rugby union people look down on league , but i like both games			0
as a sportsman , the opportunity to play another professional sport really appeals to me			0
’ @entity0 has no intention of making life easy for himself , when he tries to translate his enduring talents to union			1
many of the converts who have fared best have been outside backs such as @entity90 , but his hope is to occupy the primary decision - making role			2
‘ i ’d very much like to play fly - half – that ’s the position that would suit my skills - set the best , ’ he said			0
‘ i understand the challenge that is in front of me ; the difficulties that rugby league players have faced coming over			0
’ @entity0 and his @entity22 team - mates celebrate after beating @entity101 in the @entity102 sir @entity103 was present for the announcement in @entity22 , in his role as @entity24 ’s executive president , and the man synonymous with the @entity108 appeared visibly elated about the @entity110 ’s recruitment of such a pedigree figure , on an 18 - month deal			1
‘ this is fantastic news , ’ he said			0
‘ it is a great opportunity to get someone of @entity0 ’s quality , not just as a player but as a captain and someone who is an exceptional role model			1
‘ there was a change of ownership at @entity24 at @entity123 and the ambition is for @entity52 rugby			1
to have @entity0 involved is a great acquisition for us and a statement of intent			1
we ’ve got a lot of young men willing to learn from a natural leader			0
