white air passengers are routinely stopped and searched by customs officials simply to ensure the right racial ‘ mix ’ of travellers are being approached , a report reveals today			1
it found staff searching for illegal goods at @entity8 selected white passengers to balance the numbers against black and other ethnic minorities they suspected to help avoid race discrimination complaints			1
details of the practice are exposed in one of two highly critical reports by @entity17 , chief inspector of the @entity18 , who said it was unlawful and must stop			1
checks : white air passengers are routinely stopped and searched by customs officials simply to ensure the right racial ' mix ' of travellers at @entity8 ( pictured ) the second , criticising @entity25 , raised concerns about queues at the borders and found staff were allowed to clock off at some of the busiest times , resulting in long delays for passengers			1
targets for queuing times for passengers from outside the @entity38 were breached 62 times between september 18 and 30 last year			1
a watchdog report has revealed that rota changes and staff numbers could both be key factors in the recent chaos at passport control			1
alterations in the rota mean that staff are clocking off at the start of busy periods , leaving on duty border officers to deal with the deluge of passengers			1
it also found that staff numbers at @entity25 fell by 15 per cent in a year			1
low levels of staffing could also be a contributing factor to the fiasco has become increasingly embarrassing in the run - up to the @entity61 , prompting fears that @entity63 will become a laughing stock as half - a - million spectators arrive here from around the world			0
the rota revelations will no doubt incense passengers who have spent hours waiting to clear the checks - last week it was revealed that passengers were storming past border guards at @entity63 's airports in frustration at lengthy queues at passport control			2
the longest wait was two hours and 15 minutes			2
the racial scanning , seemingly widespread at @entity8 , involved pulling out white passengers when officials wanted to question a black passenger			1
one official told inspectors he and his colleagues ‘ specifically detained a number of white passengers ’ from one flight so they could ‘ show that white people were also being questioned ’			1
he said that when they saw arrivals they ‘ knew they had a problem ’ because the person they wanted to intercept was the only black passenger on the flight			0
the inspectors added : ‘ the officer also reported that this practice ... is also used for @entity101 flights to reduce the potential for future race claims			0
’ mr @entity17 said the approach was ‘ not justifiable ’ and that there was ‘ no legal basis for detaining people for such purpose ’			0
at @entity25 , inspectors found two - thirds of passenger searches were ‘ neither justified nor proportionate or in line with legislation and agency guidance ’			0
the reports reveal a number of other areas where the border controls at @entity63 ’s two biggest airports are failing			0
at @entity25 , they raised questions over immigration controls , with the number of people refused entry by border staff falling by 20 per cent from 2009/10 to last year			2
the numbers kicked out of the country after being blocked at the terminal border fell by one third			2
mr @entity17 questioned whether the @entity18 was still able to maintain ‘ an effective and efficient border control ’			2
at @entity8 ’s @entity132 , inspectors found passengers arriving from outside the @entity134 were routinely allowed to enter through the ‘ nothing to declare ’ channel with too much alcohol and up to three times the legal amount of cigarettes			0
staggeringly , customs officers waved through passengers found with cannabis in their luggage , instead of arresting them			0
the report said they had failed to follow ‘ appropriate procedures ’ and the passengers should have been arrested			2
inspectors reported ‘ an almost total lack of visible detection presence ’ in customs for ‘ large parts of the day ’			0
and too many suspected illegal migrants were being allowed through , including cases where attempted deception and breaches of immigration rules were clear , it found			0
the reports are published today as two major immigration unions – the @entity160 and @entity161 – walk out on strike .			0
