fish oil can counter the negative effect junk food has on the brain , say scientists			1
more than a decade of research has shown that high - fat diets can impact the brain by disrupting ' neurogenesis ' , a process that generates new nerve cells			0
now @entity11 researchers have discovered that diets rich in omega - 3s , such as fish oil , can prevent these negative effects by stimulating the area of the brain that controls feeding , learning and memory			1
research : scientists say fish oil can counter the negative effect junk food has on the brain the team from the @entity11 's @entity26 originally set out to look at research from across to world to see whether the data suggested that omega - 3s had a role to play in aiding weight loss			1
however , although data from the 185 research papers indicated fish oils do not have a direct impact on this process , it found that they play a significant role in reversing the damage high fats can cause the brain			0
researcher dr @entity43 explained : ' body weight is influenced by many factors , and some of the most important of these are the nutrients we consume			0
' excessive intake of certain macronutrients , the refined sugars and saturated fats found in junk food , can lead to weight gain , disrupt metabolism and even affect mental processing			0
study : diets rich in omega - 3s prevent the negative effects by stimulating the area of the brain that controls feeding , learning and memory ' these changes can be seen in the brain 's structure , including its ability to generate new nerve cells , potentially linking obesity to neurodegenerative diseases			1
' research , however , has suggested that omega - 3 fish oils can reverse or even prevent these effects			1
we wanted to investigate the literature on this topic to determine whether there is evidence to suggest that omega - 3s might aid weight loss by stimulating particular brain processes			1
' the research papers showed that on high - fat diets hormones that are usually secreted from body tissues into the circulation after eating - which protect neurons and stimulate their growth - are prevented from passing into the brain by increased circulation of inflammatory molecules and a type of fat called triglycerides			0
molecules that stimulate nerve growth are also reduced			0
but it appears - in studies with animal models - that omega - 3s restore normal function by interfering with the production of these inflammatory molecules , suppressing triglycerides , and returning these nerve growth factors to normal			2
dr @entity43 added : ' fish oils do n't appear to have a direct impact on weight loss , but they may take the brakes off the detrimental effects of some of the processes triggered in the brain by high - fat diets			2
' they seem to mimic the effects of calorie restrictive diets and including more oily fish or fish oil supplements in our diets could certainly be a positive step forward for those wanting to improve their general health			2
