by @entity1 reporter published : 12:06 est , 7 november 2013 updated : 03:50 est , 8 november 2013 a ‘ fountain of youth gene ’ has been identified by scientists			2
experts have long been puzzled as to why young animals recover from injuries more quickly than adults			0
the gene , @entity9 , is highly active in unborn children , but does less and less with age			1
a ' fountain of youth gene ' has been identified by scientists and helps explain why young people recover more quickly from injuries than adults in tests on mice , it quickened the healing of wounds and sped up regrowth after a patch of fur was shaved			1
it also helped repair tissues in the ear after they were injured			0
@entity9 achieved all of these effects by increasing the production of several metabolic enzymes and enhancing metabolic processes that are normally more active in embryos			2
the @entity35 scientists hope that waking the gene up in the adult body could speed up the healing of wounds after operations			1
researcher @entity41 said it may be possible to produce a drug that has the same effect as the gene			2
the gene , @entity9 , is highly active in unborn children , but does less and less with age he added : ‘ it sounds like science fiction but @entity9 could be part of a healing cocktail that gives adults the superior tissue repair seen in juvenile animals			1
’ he said : ‘ why some animals can fully regenerate organs when others can not is a longstanding mystery of biology			0
‘ our studies support the concept that mammalian tissue repair can be substantially improved by engineering the reactivation of genes that regulate juvenile developmental stages			0
’ the research is published in the journal @entity67 .			0

the gene , @entity9 , is highly active in unborn children , but does less with age
@entity35 researchers now hope that waking the gene up in adults could speed healing of wounds after operations
they say it may also be possible to create a drug that works in the same way
