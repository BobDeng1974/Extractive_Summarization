delayed again : the @entity10 is due to enter service in the second half of 2014 compared with an initial target of 2012 when it was launched as @entity60 's answer to the light - weight @entity12 pictures showed the blackened remains of the lithium device as well as a frayed and broken earth wire , designed to reduce the risk of electric shock , which was attached to it at the time it ignited			2
investigators also confirmed that they had linked the in - flight fire which forced the @entity73 service to make an emergency landing in @entity75 last month to a similar incident in @entity77			0
the latest probe is said to have found evidence of short - circuiting and ' thermal runaway ' - a chemical reaction which causes overheating			1
warning : it comes weeks after all 50 of @entity12 's brand new dreamliners were grounded indefinitely following two on - board fires , believed to have been sparked by faulty batteries overheated : the charred battery from the @entity12 plane which made an emergency landing on january 16 in @entity91 , is inspected by the manufacturer at the headquarters of @entity94 in @entity95 , western @entity75 the @entity10 is due to enter service in the second half of 2014 compared with an initial target of 2012 when it was launched as @entity60 's answer to the light - weight @entity12			1

@entity106 company @entity105 makes the @entity7 that has been ditched for the @entity10 and supplies traditional nickel - cadmium ones to the rest of @entity5 product range			0
link : investigators found similar damage to the lithium ion battery occured in both incident damage : a ground wire which was attached to the burnt battery is showed charred , frayed and broken a @entity105 spokeswoman said on friday that @entity5 was expected to use @entity105 nickel - cadmium batteries to replace the @entity7 batteries it has been developing			2
