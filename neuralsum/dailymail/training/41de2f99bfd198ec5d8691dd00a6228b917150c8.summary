the biggest ever leap in the standard of the ' three rs ' has been pledged by education secretary @entity3			1
mrs @entity4 will this week set out ambitious plans to rocket @entity6 to the top of the @entity10 league tables for reading and maths by 2020 – and become fifth best in the world			1
at present @entity6 lags back in 26th place in the world for maths and 23rd for reading			1
' three rs ' : at present @entity6 lags back in 26th place in the world for maths and 23rd for reading mrs @entity4 says the dramatic rise in literacy and numeracy – which will be a cornerstone of the @entity23 manifesto – can be achieved by driving up standards in the ' three rs ' – reading , writing and arithmetic			1
under a future conservative @entity30 , all 11 year olds will be expected to : if mrs @entity4 fails to live up to her bold promise , she can expect to pay a heavy price			2
former labour education secretary @entity34 was forced to resign in 2002 after she made a similarly bold declaration – and failed to deliver			2
however , mrs @entity4 – one of the rising stars of the government – has given herself some wriggle room by saying that she will be judged on whether she has met her target by tests in 2021 , one year after the next @entity41 if , as expected , it lasts until 2020			2
at present @entity43 , @entity42 is top of the world league in maths , followed by @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and , in fifth place , @entity50			0
the @entity51 are 10th , @entity52 16th , @entity53 19th with @entity55 one place ahead of @entity6 at 25th			0
to leapfrog @entity50 into fifth place , the standard of maths in @entity6 would have to increase by a huge 12 per cent			0
it is a similar story in reading with @entity58 7th , @entity59 11th , @entity53 14th , @entity52 20th , @entity55 21st and @entity6 23rd			1
ambitious : the biggest ever leap in the standard of the ' three rs ' has been pledged by education secretary @entity3 ( pictured ) the tables are dominated by @entity63 , in particular provinces of @entity42 – which breaks down its entries because of its size			1
the pledge by mrs @entity4 amounts to her first major policy announcement since replacing @entity70 as @entity3 last july			0
she will be keen to make her mark on the department after being called ' @entity73 ' for reversing some of mr @entity70 's policies such as snap inspections of schools to root out @entity78 extremism and relaxing rules on taking children out of school in term time			0
education is expected to be a key election battleground , with polls indictaing that @entity86 and the @entity23 are neck - and - neck on the issue			1
as part of the new drive , mrs @entity4 will also toughen up existing tests in the ' three rs ' for all children when they leave primary school			0
and there will be stiff sanctions for schools which do not meet mrs @entity4 's standards : those which fail to ensure all pupils master the basics of @entity101 and maths for two years in a row will be forced to become academies free of town hall control , or join up with local high - performing schools			0
at present only one in four state schools are academies .			0

new education secretary @entity109 will set out ambitious plans this week
she pledges @entity6 will rocket to the top of @entity10 league tables by 2020
the country is currently ranked 26th in the world for maths , 23rd for reading
