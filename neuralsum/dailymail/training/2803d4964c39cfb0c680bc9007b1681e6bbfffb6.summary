the 43 - year - old woman is being questioned by police over allegations of bribery and money laundering			1
she has already been sacked by the @entity15 , which launched its own investigation after being alerted by a whistleblower at a nursing home			1
it is understood the inspector , from @entity21 , visited a number of privately run care homes and offered to fill out ‘ favourable ’ inspection reports in exchange for bribes			1
her arrest yesterday morning is yet another blow for the @entity15 , which has been dogged by accusations it is failing to protect vulnerable patients			2
only this week it emerged carers at a home rated as ‘ excellent ’ had repeatedly slapped and manhandled an elderly woman with dementia			2
a @entity15 spokesman said that after it was alerted , the woman was sacked for gross misconduct and the @entity15 informed @entity40			1
@entity41 , the @entity15 ’s director of governance and legal services , said : ‘ our inspectors operate to extremely high standards of integrity and professionalism			2
‘ unfortunately , in any large workforce there is a risk that a tiny minority may act in a way that betrays the principles of their colleagues and of the organisation as a whole , which is what has happened here			0
a @entity15 spokesman said that after it was alerted , the 43 - year - old woman was sacked for gross misconduct and the @entity15 informed @entity40 ‘ having investigated allegations made to us about this inspector and found these were substantiated , we terminated their employment with immediate effect and referred the matter to the police			1
‘ this inspector has failed the organisation , failed the providers who rely on us to act fairly and impartially , and – most importantly – failed in their responsibility to protect people who use these services			0

’ detective inspector @entity78 said : ‘ we are working closely with @entity15 to thoroughly investigate these allegations			0

’ earlier this year , the @entity15 ’s chief executive , @entity82 , resigned amid concerns the organisation was failing to adequately inspect care homes and hospitals			1
in march , mps on the @entity88 accused the organisation of putting its reputation ahead of the safety of patients			0
other reports by mps have criticised the watchdog for prioritising box - ticking over carrying out spot checks of care homes			0
but the @entity15 claims it has made substantial improvements in recent months and drastically increased the number of inspections			0
yesterday it announced it would be investigating the standards of care for 250 elderly folk in their own homes .			0
