by @entity0 war of words : @entity3 , 25 , has struggled with reading and writing all his life when @entity3 walked down the aisle of @entity7 to deliver his reading at the marriage of his sister – to a global television audience of two billion – he had more reason than most to be gripped by anxiety			1
he knew the eyes of the world were upon him but it was his own struggle with reading that was his biggest concern			1
his reading turned out to be a masterclass in measured oratory , made all the more remarkable by the fact that @entity3 still struggles to read because of his dyslexia – a broad term to describe a common learning difficulty			1
as a boy , even reading to a class of his peers terrified him			1
to ensure a word - perfect delivery at @entity7 , he had to rewrite the biblical text into a version he could understand			1
speaking now to raise awareness on behalf of the @entity32 , he recalls : ‘ i had to retype the whole of the reading phonetically , and that ’s how i learnt it			1
‘ in that way i became confident in it , and then i felt i was perfectly capable of doing it			1
at the end of the day , whether it was in a little church or @entity7 did n’t matter , it was me , as a brother , doing a reading for my sister and her husband at their wedding and i wanted to do it right			1
’ as anyone who watched him will surely agree , the words were moving			2
the speech was followed , naturally , by an enormous sense of relief			2
‘ yes , there was definitely a big sort of sigh afterwards , ’ he says , smiling			2
indeed , today , @entity3 , 25 , appears every inch the confident young businessman , but this comes only after years learning to manage his dyslexia , which he was formally diagnosed with at the age of 11			1
daunting : @entity3 retyped a biblical text phonetically so he could read it at his sister @entity65 's wedding to prince @entity67 word perfect : but when the moment came , his reading was spot on without a hitch long before that , problems with reading and writing had been flagged up by his teachers			1
at primary school in @entity79 , @entity3 recalls being given extra lessons , and being issued with magnifying bifocal spectacles to help letters on the page stand out			1
‘ i was fine with numbers but it took me a longer time to grasp simple things like spellings , ’ he says			2
‘ i used to spell everything phonetically , or i would have little tricks for words i could not figure out			1
‘ so “ said ” was @entity92 , and “ because ” was @entity93			2
words that had double letters completely baffled me			2
at that stage it was n’t a particular issue though – i just found it a bit of a pain to have these extra lessons because i wanted to be outside playing			2
’ proud moment : @entity3 wanted his reading to be right for his sister and prince @entity67 at 11 , his struggles were such that he was asked to sit a literacy exam , after which he was formally diagnosed as dyslexic			1
‘ there was some relief in that , because a lot of the strain comes from trying to hide it , ’ he says			2
by 13 , however , enrolling at @entity115 – the prestigious fee - paying school his sisters attended – stepped up the pressure			1
‘ spelling and reading are something you ’re expected to be able to do by then , so if you struggle at them , it ’s not the easiest , ’ he says			1
‘ i even had a little rhyme to learn how to spell @entity115 as my father said i would never get in if i could n’t even spell the name of the school			2
’ in common with other children with literacy issues , @entity3 dreaded any form of public performance			1
‘ when i read out loud in class it was a joy for everyone else because i would mispronounce things so badly , ’ he recalls			2
‘ i used to try to count how many people were in front of me and then work out which paragraph i would have to read out and start trying to learn it			2
and i would sit there thinking , “ please let the bell go so that it does n’t get round to me			2
’ ’ ‘ there was a certain amount of teasing but i built up a bit of resilience and i was competent in other areas			2
there were other boys in the same boat , too			2
’ many dyslexia sufferers struggle with concentration and retention of information but @entity3 – whose maternal grandfather was dyslexic – says that these were never real difficulties for him			1
his coping strategies centred on painstaking preparation and , on occasion , smoke and mirrors			2
‘ i realised that if i could write the first two letters of the word then put a squiggle , as if it was bad handwriting , people would fill in the gap , ’ he recalls			1
school time : @entity3 , pictured centre on a class trip aged 13 , hated exams because of his condition close family : @entity3 pictured with his father @entity172 , mother @entity173 and sister @entity174 going his own way : @entity3 left university to start up his own business , @entity178 , which makes personalised cakes nothing , however , could erase the horror of exams – not even being allotted extra time			1
‘ exams are the most crucifying thing for someone who is dyslexic because you feel you can not justify yourself , it does not reflect your true capacity , ’ says @entity3			1
‘ it ’s frustrating because it ’s not a lack of understanding : you almost need to write your own question about the topic so you can really show what you can do			0
’ @entity197 is one of the most common learning disorders , according to dr @entity199 , head of research for @entity201			0
one in ten people in the @entity203 has the condition to some degree , with it running in families			0
most experts now agree on its central symptoms			0
‘ an accumulation of evidence shows that core difficulties centre in the way language is processed , ’ says dr rack			0
‘ in particular , there are problems with analysing and breaking down spoken words , which also seems to lie at the root of dealing with problems with written words			0
' this is what makes learning to read particularly difficult			0
' alongside that , it is quite likely you are going to find trouble concentrating , or the inability to retain a lot of information at the same time			0
‘ probably only half of those diagnosed have severe difficulties where they need a lot of support – for the rest it ’s entirely manageable			1
‘ for anyone with dyslexia , if you get help and learn to develop coping mechanisms and strategies , you can almost always find a way through			1
’ dr @entity199 believes that genetic screening is not an entirely distant prospect			0
‘ we know dyslexia runs in families and we know quite a bit about some of the genes involved in passing it on , ’ he says			1
‘ imaging studies show there are different degrees of connections and patterns in the language area of the brains of those with and without dyslexia			1
‘ although this is not something we can currently use diagnostically , there is exciting research into very early indications , even in @entity268 could potentially lead to well - timed intervention			1
’ and so , despite hours of study , his a-level grades were not good enough to secure a university place , meaning retakes at a local sixth - form college			1
it was , he admits , a tricky period , particularly for his mother and father			0
‘ i used to say that i did n’t fail the exams , it was the exams that failed me			0
it was my teenage ego saying that , but actually it ’s sort of true , ’ he says			0
‘ but it did n’t make things easier at the time : i had very capable sisters who had succeeded in exams , then i came along and naturally my parents did n’t know what to do because i applied myself really well to work , and they fully were expecting me to go to university – as did @entity293 ’ successful retakes allowed him to take up a place at @entity296 to study environmental geosciences and rural resources management in 2006			0
yet after two weeks , @entity3 says , he knew university was n’t for him			1
‘ i knew i was going down the wrong path			0
i stayed for a year , but then i made the decision to leave			0
it was against everyone ’s advice because i ’d retaken my exams to try to get in and then there i was giving it up			0
but i never feel i dropped out – i was just ready to move on and do something different			0
’ the decision meant giving up his independence to move back home			0
but this only boosted his determination to create his own success story			0
within a few months he had started his own business , the @entity178 , and now runs a parallel business , @entity317 , which specialises in personalised cakes			0
‘ i did n’t look back really , ’ he says			0
‘ @entity319 is great but it was n’t right for me			0
’ these days , he says , he is entirely comfortable with the fact he is dyslexic , even if it does mean committing the occasional professional blooper			0
‘ i had 1,000 business cards printed this year , but i had to throw them in the bin because i spelt “ personalised ” wrong , ’ he reveals			0
‘ not ideal , given the thing i do is personalised cakes			0
but i just looked at it and i could not see it			0
‘ i do make lots of spelling mistakes still – for a time the word “ corporate ” on my website was spelled “ coprate ”			1
but i ’m not embarrassed			0
the way i see it , it is part of me			0
the key is to become completely confident about it			0
’ having this outlook could be helped by earlier diagnosis , and some experts believe that genetic screening for the condition will eventually be possible			0
for @entity3 , the notion is a welcome one , although he maintains he would not change the man he ’s become			1
‘ if i had a choice i would still choose to be dyslexic , because i feel it helps me see things in a different way , ’ he says			0
‘ there is a talent in dyslexia , it can help you see things creatively			1
so i would n’t change a thing			0
’ additional reporting : @entity362 - @entity361			1

@entity365 of @entity366 's brother was diagnosed with dyslexia when he was 11 - years - old
now 25 , @entity3 still struggles with his spelling and reading
but he managed to deliver his word - perfect reading by retyping the whole of the biblical text phonetically
