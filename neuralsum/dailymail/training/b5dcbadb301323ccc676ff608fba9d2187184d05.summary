@entity1 boss @entity0 has told @entity3 chairman @entity2 to stop ‘ moaning ’ as the row over the @entity6 transfer fee rumbles on			1
an @entity8 tribunal this week ordered the @entity10 club to fork out £ 204,000 in compensation to the @entity13 club after signing the youngster in the summer			1
rarely used by @entity0 , @entity15 under - 19 midfielder @entity6 turned down a new contract after 10 years at @entity1 to team up with @entity18 ’s side on a @entity19 and was named @entity20			1
@entity3 have been told to pay @entity1 £ 204,000 for youngster @entity6 ( second from left ) after tuesday ’s verdict , @entity3 chief @entity2 , who had initially offered £ 100,000 for the 19 - year - old , described the figure as ‘ ridiculously prohibitive ’ and warned it could have a serious impact on young @entity27 players ’ ability to move clubs under freedom of contract			1
but @entity0 hit back by claiming @entity2 has no reason to complain because he knew the regulations before making his move to land the talented teenager			1
‘ @entity2 knew the rules before he went and got @entity6 , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i do n’t think you can complain about the rules after you make your own decision			1
you have to abide by them			2
‘ of course i can understand @entity3 ’s disappointment and frustration			1
but they knew the rules before [ they signed @entity6 ] and now they are having a moan about the rules			1
i ’m not so sure i can understand people complaining about the rules after when they know the rules			2
‘ we got our just rewards for the education we gave @entity6 over the last 10 years			1
’ the @entity1 boss will be without star man @entity53 tonight for the @entity55 clash against @entity56 but revealed the hamstring injury sustained in the horror @entity60 semi-final defeat at @entity61 wo n’t lead to a lengthy spell on the sidelines for the recent @entity15 call - up			2
@entity1 boss @entity0 believes @entity3 chairman @entity2 should stop complaining yet , while @entity0 says there is nothing to report on interest in the creative midfielder , he does n’t expect his injury to render his star player invisible to other clubs			1
‘ i do n’t expect interest probably because i ’m not wanting any interest , ’ he said			2
‘ but i ’m not daft enough to think that good players do n’t attract interest and @entity53 is obviously a very , very good player we will just have to react to whatever happens			2
‘ but it goes without saying that i understand the economics of the whole situation and i would n’t be too keen on losing one of our better younger players			2
’ meanwhile , @entity13 midfielder @entity82 has admitted he felt like hiding away after that @entity84 debacle against @entity61 last midweek			0
but he vowed that effort is not a problem at @entity13			0
@entity6 ( right ) tussles with @entity90 's @entity89 during a @entity92 clash at @entity10 ‘ there ’s nobody in our dressing room pointing fingers and accusing others of not trying , ’ he said			1
‘ it ’s nothing to do with a lack of effort			0
we ’ve just been switching off at the wrong times			0
but we are proud professionals and the desire to win this league is huge			0
‘ but i feel for the fans because they are disappointed			0
i saw some of them were suggesting we should have gone over to them after losing matches ( at @entity61 and @entity109 ) , like the @entity111 players did when they lost ( at @entity112 in the @entity113 )			0
but that ’s probably the last thing we should have done			0
‘ after losing , the last thing our fans would want to shake is our hands			0
‘ but i feel for the manager too			0
he ’s taking the stick and he ’s hurting			0
but we are the players who are making mistakes and not doing our jobs and we owe it to him to start winning			0
‘ but we are still in three great competitions we are confident we can still have a good season			0

an @entity8 tribunal has ordered @entity3 to pay £ 204,000 for @entity6
the @entity10 club expected to pay around half of that amount
but @entity0 believes the club must accept the decision and move on
