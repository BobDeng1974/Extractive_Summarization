but new research suggests many students are risking their health through irresponsible sexual habits			2
some 23 per cent of students admit to having caught a sexually transmitted infection during their first year alone , according to a new survey			2
nearly a quarter of students admit to having caught a sexually transmitted infection during their first year of university			2
the majority of encounters happened after drinking alcohol the poll , rather ironically conducted by the website @entity25 , also revealed that 21 per cent caught an sti after their first year but before they finished their studies			1
the research also revealed that theatre studies students appeared to be the most promiscuous , with an average of 28 sexual partners while at university			1
the next most promiscuous are dance students , who have an average of 25 sexual partners			1
media studies students have an average of 22 sexual partners and biology students have 19			1
media studies / @entity41 - 224			0
philosophy and ethics - 176			0
@entity49 - 10 in contrast , law students have an average of 11 sexual partners during the time at university and geographers 10			1
worryingly , the survey of 2,177 young adults who had recently graduated found 89 per cent of students do not use condoms for the majority of their sexual encounters			1
the poll , which only involved people who had remained single while at university , also revealed that 73 per cent of students were under the influence of alcohol when engaging in the majority of their sexual encounters			1
more than half – 54 per cent – also admitted to being unable to recall who gave them their sti			0
of the respondents , 32 per cent said they found out about their infection after being contacted by someone they had slept with who had been diagnosed			0
another 27 per cent said they were only diagnosed after being given a free testing kit			0
more than half of students who have had an @entity72 - 54 per cent - admit to being unable to recall who gave them the @entity72 nearly 60 per cent of students who caught an @entity72 contracted chlamydia , 18 per cent caught herpes and 14 per cent genital warts			1
possibly the most worrying finding was that 67 per cent of respondents said they would rather risk another sti than use a condom			1
in the past ten years , the number of under - 25s being diagnosed with @entity94 had increased by almost 50 per cent			0
gonorrhoea rates are increasing particularly rapidly - they have risen by a fifth in the last year			0
this is thought to be because of a new super-strain of the disease that can not easily be treated with antibiotics			0
a report by @entity102 shows there were 448,422 new cases of sexually transmitted infections ( @entity94 ) in 2012 , including chlamydia , herpes and genital warts			2
the total was up by five per cent on the previous year and 46 per cent higher than 2003 , when figures were first collected			0
rates are highest among the under - 25s , with nearly two - third of chlamydia cases , and more than half of gonorrhoea infections , occurring in this age group			2
the @entity102 report states : ‘ the continuing high @entity72 rates in @entity102 suggest too many people are still putting themselves at risk through unsafe sex , especially young adults and men who have sex with men			1
’ it urges the under - 25s to ensure they use protection with ‘ casual partners ’ and have regular checks at sexual health clinics			1
@entity131 , of the @entity132 , said there was less awareness of the importance of contraception among the young , adding : ‘ the worry is that condom use is not being taught in schools			0
there may be less awareness in people ’s conscience			0
