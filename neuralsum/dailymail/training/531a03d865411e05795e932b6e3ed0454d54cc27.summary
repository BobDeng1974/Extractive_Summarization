' i 'd love to go to @entity29 three years in a row if i can			0
' it 's going to be tough because they have some quality players but i just want to enjoy this competition and with the players here i think we have a chance			0
' the 25 - year - old is one of the poster boys of @entity6 football having made the move to the @entity50 and helping his country to the @entity53 finals in @entity54			1
and he knows that another @entity1 triumph at @entity19 would send shock waves right across the globe to his football - mad homeland			1
ki losing out to @entity62 's @entity61 as @entity12 were defeated at @entity29 in the final last year ' there are more @entity7 supporters than @entity1 back home in @entity6 as they are one of the biggest teams in @entity36 , ' @entity0 said			1
' if we win against @entity7 it 's going to be big news , so we have nothing to lose and do our best			2

and @entity91 is set to do the same again as he comes up against another one of his former @entity1 managers in the shape of @entity94			0
@entity1 manager @entity86 guided @entity1 to a 2 - 0 win against @entity97 on saturday @entity98 and @entity99 , who limped off in the second half of the league win over @entity97 on saturday evening with an ankle injury , could be rested alongside goalkeeper @entity103			2
but @entity91 will resist the idea of mass rotation and that means centre - back @entity107 could play at @entity19 , although the @entity1 skipper admits he will not be swapping shirts with @entity111 at half - time if he comes up against the @entity113			1
the @entity7 striker sparked controversy during @entity7 's @entity117 tie with @entity118 last week when he swapped shirts with @entity121 defender @entity120 as the pair were leaving the pitch at the interval			0
