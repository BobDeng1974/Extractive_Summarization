pictures of the @entity1 in @entity2 can be found on @entity3			1
by any stretch the venue is unremarkable			1
two bulky speakers mount a stage in front of the window , amplifying live music for the locals			1
it ’s the kind of pub found in any @entity15 town			1
a place where , at weekends , a man can barely manage a conversation over the din			1
@entity21 ’s move to @entity22 did n’t work out but he found his form at @entity24 working as a bar man following an ill - starred two years at @entity26 , however , @entity21 heard the comments			1
the withering asides from the other side of the bar asking what had happened to @entity15 football ’s next big thing			1
this week the 24 - year - old signed for @entity35			1
back when he was recuperating from a shattered hip , his future looked less certain			1
he took a job in the @entity39 while the injury recovered			1
with every pint he pulled the lips of customers loosened a little more			1
‘ working in the bar was funny because , as the hours tick on , people get drunker and drunker , ’ recalls @entity21 now			1
‘ they then start to say what they think			2
‘ there were definitely murmurs of : “ what are you doing back here ? ”			2
people would say : “ you could be doing this or that ”			2
or ask : “ what are you playing at ? ”			2
’ ‘ but all that went in one ear and out the other			2
i always knew my vision and what i wanted to do			2
i was just waiting to feel good in myself again			2
‘ i enjoyed working there			2
it was nice and i appreciate a lot of things now			2
’ it was his first spell back in @entity2 since leaving at the age of 15 to join @entity70			2
@entity21 ( right ) and @entity71 ( left ) pictured in @entity35 kits at their unveilings on tuesday @entity74 , the head of @entity26 ’s academy at the time , had spotted and nurtured @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79			1
he saw something in @entity21 as well			1
the injuries were his downfall , friends and the job in the pub his salvation			2
‘ i had an agent @entity87 , ’ continues @entity21 , ‘ and i ’m still with him now			1
he understood my decision when i said i needed to take a step back from football			2
‘ he was supportive and stuck by me			2
i remember speaking to @entity87 after a time out of the game and telling him i felt good again			2
i ’d been training myself down my local park , just me and a ball , and i felt ready			2
‘ it ’s funny , i still do that to this day if i have a day off			1
‘ i go to the park myself with a ball and practice			0
i feel a bit stupid — @entity71 is doing a law degree on his time off and i ’m doing keepy - uppies			1
‘ but i do n’t think i ’ll ever stop that			0
‘ i ’ve always had that passion			0
even if it was raining , my mum — probably to get me out of her hair when she was cooking the dinner — would tell me to go out with a ball			0
’ when the hip recovered he took a call from the manager of @entity24			0
the @entity114 was a steep downward step from @entity26			1
well - grounded and level - headed , however , @entity21 realised the comeback had to start somewhere			1
the former @entity118 duo are all smiles as they hold up their respective shirts for new side @entity35 ‘ i was never feeling hard done by or “ why has this happened to me ? ” , ’ he says			1
‘ it was out of my hands , it could have happened to anyone			0
i was fortunate enough to move to @entity26 at a young age — not many people do that at such a young age			1
some people my age could have been at school			0
‘ it gave me an experience and a taste of something which i think helped make me hungrier to get back to where i feel i can be			0
‘ my family — my mum in particular — were there for me and did n’t ever let me think too much about things			0
‘ i had massive support from them			0
i ’ve taken a different route to the top but i ’ m here now , i ’m still young , fit and healthy and feel very grateful			0
’ @entity146 were a key cog in his revival			0
on you tube a collage of his top five moments of skill , published in honour of his 24th birthday , garnered nearly 50,000 views			0
brilliant individualism in @entity158 games against @entity159 and @entity160 have the viewer slowing down the images and pausing them to absorb the footwork fully			0
‘ it ’s nice that people think of me as a skilful player , ’ he shrugs , ‘ but i think that just come naturally			0
‘ i ’ll never change the way i play			0
hopefully people enjoy it because football is about entertaining people , doing something different and getting bums off seats			0
‘ that ’s all i try and do			0
end product is the most important thing , as managers always say , so maybe in the first few weeks here at @entity35 i ’ll give the tricks a miss. ’ @entity21 made his comeback at @entity24 after recovering from hip injury some players arrive at @entity184 and flounder			1
the scale and demands serve only to imtimidate them			0
@entity21 feels better prepared because of the @entity26 set - back			1
and the experience he has of weathering hard times			0
‘ i was a young boy when i went to @entity26 but i do n’t regret anything , i ’d do it again if i was back there			1
it was an amazing experience for me			0
‘ i feel mentally strong , having gone through what i ’ve gone through			0
‘ i do n’t think there ’s ever been a time where i thought i could n’t make it to the top , i had faith and confidence in my ability and that ’s stood me in good stead from a young age			0
‘ i ’m here now and relishing the prospect of getting started and getting involved in the games with @entity35			1
‘ obviously i appreciate it more now , i ’m at a club like @entity35 and i ’m delighted and want to make the most of it			1
’ he once attended a @entity213 game at @entity184 as a spectator , but now stands in line for a home debut against @entity217 in a fortnight			0
it ’s a game friends , family and former customers can watch on a television on the wall of the @entity1			0
‘ i ’m still close to a lot of people in @entity2 , ’ says @entity21			1
‘ i have a lot of friends back there			0
my family are still there and i like to go home when i can			0
it does n’t happen very often because it ’s a camel trek from here			0
‘ but i ’m definitely still close to a lot of people there			0
’ even those who once asked , through the bottom of a pint glass , if @entity21 ’s party had ended before it ever really began .			1
