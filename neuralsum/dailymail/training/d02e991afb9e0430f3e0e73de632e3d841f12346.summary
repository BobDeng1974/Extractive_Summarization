by @entity0 ' @entity1 ' : @entity2 , 22 , had her position as an @entity5 air hostess taken away in light of her medical history a @entity9 woman had her dream job as an air hostess snatched away after her would - be employers realised she used to suffer from depression			1
@entity2 , 22 , was offered a post with @entity5 last month , and was so set on her life in the skies that she immediately turned down other job opportunities			1
but this week she had the job offer snatched from her grasp in light of a medical form the company asked her to complete - which revealed that she used to have depression			1
miss @entity2 , who was diagnosed with the condition in 2012 , sent a message from her doctor explaining that she had recovered and that there was no reason to be concerned			1
however , the @entity30 - based company withdrew the job offer regardless			1
because air hostesses travel across the world for their job , it is not always clear whether they are covered by @entity9 employment law			1
miss @entity2 , of @entity36 , @entity37 , launched a protest page on @entity39 called @entity40 , describing her situation			1
she wrote : ' in april i was offered my dream job with @entity5 after the incredibly tough open day and final interview			1
' one week after i was offered the job as a cabin crew member , i was given a ridiculous medical ... as part of the medical , i needed to agree for @entity5 to view all of my medical history			1
miss @entity2 said that filling out the medical form was the final stage in a costly application process that cost her more than £ 1,000 on fees , administration , travel vaccines and transport			1
she said : ' i spent over £ 1,000 during the recruitment process , on necessary vaccinations , travel , transport and £ 50 for my doctor 's medical assessment			1
' i have suffered twice with depression , once in 2009 and again in 2012 , after horrific and traumatic events happened in my life			2
' my doctor explained that i had recovered and was no longer on any medication and my depression was caused because of events , and was not a pre-existing condition			2
@entity2 said : ' i feel completely discriminated against			2
i was given every indication that i was going to get the job and to have it snatched away from me like this because of something in the past is so cruel			2
' i did n't receive any further feedback about why i had been rejected by @entity5			2
i do n't want anyone else to go through this situation			0
' i am only human and i had medication to help me sleep and with my emotions , during a very difficult time in my life			0
' wanted to scream ' : miss @entity2 wrote online of her shock at the withdrawn job , and said @entity5 had lost out on the ' perfect ' air hostess ' i think it is terrible i have been discriminated against because of this and i want to help others look out for this '			1
however , miss @entity2 later took @entity5 to task for their rejection , which she said had only increased her determination			1
' i read horror stories online about them rejecting people			0
and today i received one paragraph stating that my contract has been withdrawn due to this reason			0
' i was hysterical and wanted to scream			0
it 's heartbreaking losing your dream job			1
' but good riddance , @entity5			2
i 'm a human being , who has been through hell and back during certain times of my life			0
i 've needed to take a few pills to help me sleep and bring my mood up			0
' @entity112 made me a stronger , healthier person and opened my eyes to the world			0
it 's given me life experience that you could n't comprehend ... i would have been the perfect air hostess			2
turnaround : @entity30 - based @entity5 airlines withdrew their job offer after receiving the medical form ' fair ' : @entity30 - based @entity5 insisted its processes were fair ' @entity5 , you 've just lost one of your strongest , hard - working potential employees who would have contributed to your company substantially ... you will not bring me down			1
you 've just made me even stronger			0
' since the rejection @entity2 has taken up an admin job at @entity130 , and says she is better off not working for @entity5			1
she said : ' i 'm not where i want to be , but now i know what the company are like , i 'm better off not working for them '			2
@entity112 is an illness which causes a person to feel persistently sad for weeks or months at a time			0
it can also cause feelings of hopelessness , a loss of interest in life and physical symptoms such as fatigue , insomnia , loss of appetite and libido , and aches and pains			0
@entity112 can vary in severity - in mild cases it may cause a person to feel persistently low , while in its most severe form it can cause people to feel suicidal and as though life if not worth living			0
the condition can affect up to one in six people , although some experts estimate it affects one in four at some time in their life – and is thought to be more common in women			0
there is sometimes a trigger for depression - such as bereavement - but it can also occur for no obvious reason			2
treatment options include talking therapies and anti-depressant medications			0
depression sufferers can also benefit from eating healthily , exercising and reducing alcohol consumption			0
source : @entity171 campaigners last night insisted that having a history of mental health is no reason to be rejected for a job			2
@entity177 , the head of mental health charity @entity179 , said : ' people can recover from depression as they do from any physical illness or injury , therefore it is wrong that they should be discriminated against and considered unfit to work			0
' it is estimated that one in four people will experience an episode of depression or similar mental health condition , the vast majority of whom continue to work effectively '			0
and spokesman for the time to change mental health campaigner told @entity197 : ' one in four people experience mental health problems in any year but this does n’t mean they ca n’t work and do just as good a job as anyone else '			0
according to legal experts , withdrawing a job offer on the grounds of past depression can be illegal - provided the court judges the condition to be a ' disability '			1
@entity209 , an employment solicitor at @entity210 , told @entity211 : ‘ in the @entity9 employees who have suffered from health issues in the past may be protected from discrimination under the @entity216 , if those health issues meet the test of “ disability ” under the @entity216			0
’ however , @entity5 is not a @entity9 - based company and it is legally contentious whether staff such as air hostesses who work all over the world are covered by @entity9 employment law			1
when confronted about miss @entity2 's case , @entity5 insisted that its processes were ' fair ' but than being part of the cabin crew is a ' demanding ' job			1
a spokesman said : ' @entity5 has a clear and fair recruitment process and is an equal opportunity employer ... all applications are reviewed closely ... for this extremely demanding role			1
we are unable to comment on individual recruitment cases ' .			0
