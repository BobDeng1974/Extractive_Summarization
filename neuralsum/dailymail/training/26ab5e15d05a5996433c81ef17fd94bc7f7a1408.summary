@entity0 spent forty minutes writhing in agony before dying of a heart attack a death row inmate spent forty minutes writhing in agony before dying of a heart attack following a new cocktail of drugs administered in a lethal injection on tuesday night			1
@entity10 prison officials halted @entity0 's execution after the experimental drug left the man writhing and clenching his teeth on the gurney			1
the 38 - year - old , who was found guilty of shooting a woman and watching his friends bury her alive , was declared unconscious ten minutes after the first of the state 's new three - drug lethal injection combination was administered			1
three minutes later , though , he began breathing heavily , writhing , clenching his teeth and straining to lift his head off the pillow			0
it later emerged his vein had ruptured			0
the blinds were eventually lowered to prevent those in the viewing gallery from watching what was happening in the death chamber , and the state 's top prison official eventually called a halt to the proceedings			2
@entity0 died of a heart attack a short time later , the @entity36 said			1
local media present said mr @entity0 sat up and said ' something â€™s wrong ' 13 minutes into the procedure			1
' it was a horrible thing to witness			0
this was totally botched , ' said @entity0 's attorney , @entity43			2
@entity0 was sentenced to death for shooting @entity49 , right , and watching his friends bury her alive witness @entity51 told broadcaster @entity52 was thrashing about and appeared to be in pain			1
' his body was sort of bucking			0
he was clenching his jaw			0
several times he mumbled phrases that were largely unintelligible , ' she said			0
a @entity60 newspaper claimed that @entity0 was ' still alive , ' and lifted his head as prison officials lowered the blinds			2
tuesday was the first time @entity10 used the drug midazolam as the first element in its execution drug combination			1
other states have used it before ; @entity70 administers 500 milligrams of midazolam as part of its three - drug combination			2
@entity10 used 100 milligrams of that drug			2
@entity76 gov. @entity76 ordered stay of execution for @entity79 who was scheduled to die two hours after @entity0 ' they should have anticipated possible problems with an untried execution protocol , ' @entity43 said			2
' obviously the whole thing was gummed up and botched from beginning to end			0
halting the execution obviously did @entity0 no good			2
' @entity76 gov. @entity76 ordered a 14 - day stay of execution for an inmate who was scheduled to die two hours after @entity0 , @entity79			1
she also ordered the state 's @entity36 to conduct a ' full review of @entity10 's execution procedures to determine what happened and why during this evening 's execution			1
' @entity45 , the department 's director , halted @entity0 's execution about 20 minutes after the first drug was administered			1
he later said there had been vein failure			0
the execution began at 6:23 p.m. , when officials began administering the first drug , the sedative midazolam			0
a doctor declared @entity0 to be unconscious at 6:33 p.m. once an inmate is declared unconscious , the state 's execution protocol calls for the second drug , a paralytic , to be administered			1
the third drug in the protocol is potassium chloride , which stops the heart			0
6:23 p.m. - the injection process begins			0
@entity0 has heavy , slow blinks , laid still 6:29 p.m. - @entity116 closed his eyes 6:30 p.m. - first check of consciousness ; still conscious 6:33 p.m. - announced @entity0 was officially unconscious 6:34 p.m. - @entity0 started to move his mouth 6:36 p.m. - @entity0 began convulsing and mumbling 6:37 p.m. - @entity0 sat up and said ' something 's wrong ' 6:39 p.m. - @entity123 officials lowered the blinds 7:06 p.m. - @entity0 dies of massive heart attack @entity45 said the second and third drugs were being administered when a problem was noticed			1
he said it 's unclear how much of the drugs made it into the inmate 's system			1
@entity0 began writhing at 6:36			0
at 6:39 , a doctor lifted the sheet that was covering the inmate to examine the injection site			0
' there was some concern at that time that the drugs were not having that ( desired ) effect , and the doctor observed the line at that time and determined the line had blown , ' @entity45 said at a news conference afterward , referring to @entity0 's vein rupturing			1
after an official lowered the blinds , @entity45 made a series of phone calls before calling a halt to the execution			0
' after conferring with the warden , and unknown how much drugs went into him , it was my decision at that time to stop the execution , ' @entity45 told reporters			0
@entity0 was declared dead at 7:06 p.m. @entity43 , @entity0 's attorney , was immediately skeptical of the department 's determination the issue was limited to a problem with @entity0 's vein			2
' i 'm not a medical professional , but mr. @entity0 was not someone who had compromised veins , ' @entity43 said			0
' he was in very good shape			0
he had large arms and very prominent veins			0
' @entity170 , who reports for the @entity171 in their @entity10 bureau , tweeted immediately after the botched execution ' after weeks of @entity10 refusing to disclose basic information about the drugs for tonight 's lethal injection procedures , tonight @entity0 was tortured to death , ' said @entity178 , an attorney for @entity79			1
@entity179 , co-chair of the @entity180 to abolish the @entity181 , accused the state of having ' tortured a human being in an unconstitutional experimental act of evil , ' reported @entity186			0
in @entity190 , the january execution of an inmate who made snorting and gasping sounds led to a civil rights lawsuit by his family and calls for a moratorium			0
nightmare : @entity45 said the inmate was writhing on the gurney , pictured , and shaking uncontrollably about 13 minutes into the execution tuesday was the first time @entity10 used the drug midazolam as the first element in its execution drug combination			1
other states have used it before ; @entity70 administers 500 milligrams of midazolam as part of its three - drug combination			0
the problems with the execution are likely to fuel more debate about the ability of states to administer lethal injections that meet the @entity216 @entity215 's requirement they be neither cruel nor unusual punishment			2
that question has drawn renewed attention from defense attorneys and death penalty opponents in recent months , as several states scrambled to find new sources of execution drugs because drugmakers that oppose capital punishment - many based in @entity228 - have stopped selling to prisons and corrections departments			1
defense attorneys have unsuccessfully challenged several states ' policies of shielding the identities of the new sources of their execution drugs			0
@entity237 and @entity238 , like @entity10 , have both refused to reveal their sources , but both of those states have since successfully carried out executions with their new supplies			2
the state has stood by the execution but said monday that it 's boosting the dosages of its lethal injection drugs			2
a four - time felon , @entity0 was convicted of shooting 19 - year - old @entity49 with a sawed - off shotgun and watching as two accomplices buried her alive in rural @entity251 in 1999 after @entity252 and a friend arrived at a home the men were robbing			1
@entity79 had been scheduled to be put to death two hours later in the same room and on the same gurney			0
the 46 - year - old was convicted of raping and killing his roommate 's 11 - month - old daughter in 1997			1
he has maintained his innocence			0
@entity0 and @entity79 had sued the state for refusing to disclose details about the execution drugs , including where @entity10 obtained them			1
the case , filed as a civil matter , placed @entity10 's two highest courts at odds and prompted calls for the impeachment of state @entity275 justices after the court last week issued a rare stay of execution			1
the high court later dissolved its stay and dismissed the inmates ' claim that they were entitled to know the source of the drugs			0
by then , @entity76 had issued a stay of her own - a one - week delay in @entity0 's execution that resulted in both men being scheduled to die on the same day			1
@entity79 was served a final meal tuesday of 20 boneless chicken wings , potato wedges , cole slaw , two fruit cocktail cups and a 20 - ounce soda			1
@entity0 's request of steak , shrimp , a large baked potato and a @entity301 pecan pie was denied because it exceeded the $ 15 limit			1
he declined a separate offer from the warden for a dinner from @entity307 ' , prison officials said			0
@entity10 changed its execution protocols twice this year , leaving @entity311 officials with five options for lethal injections , including a new three - drug mixture that was used for the first time tuesday			1
two of the drugs used carry warnings that they can suppress the respiratory system and the third warns that cardiac trouble can occur at high but non-lethal doses , and lists specific steps to take if a medical patient receives too much of the drug but does n't die .			2

@entity0 execution halted 20 minutes after first drug administered
the cocktail of injections have not been tried in @entity10 before
for reasons unclear the drugs did n't kill him
@entity0 sat up 14 minutes in and said ' something 's wrong '
the inmate finally suffered a massive heart attack and died at *7.06p.m* .
@entity0 was sentenced to death for shooting a 19 - year - old @entity344 woman
refused last meal as it exceeded $ 15 price limit
