by @entity0 published : 17:15 est , 14 august 2012 updated : 02:36 est , 15 august 2012 cowboy cosmetic surgery clinics are to be banned from treating patients unless their staff have proper qualifications			1
the @entity5 will today announce a review of the industry to protect women from botched breast enlargements and @entity11 injections administered by staff who have had just a few hours of training			1
the @entity15 medical director , professor sir @entity16 , aims to tighten the rules on advertising and toughen up regulations			2
concerns : the review was ordered into the cosmetic surgery industry after the recent issue with silicone gel breast implants manufactured by @entity26 company @entity25 ( @entity25 ) ( pictured ) health secretary @entity27 commissioned the review following fears over the safety of @entity25 breast implants			1
senior sources say the government is set to ban aggressive advertising of ‘ two for one ’ deals on cosmetic surgery – for instance a breast enlargement with a free tummy tuck – and clinics that encourage women to go under the knife purely for vanity reasons			1
the review is expected to recommend the creation of a compulsory register of implants so women ’s health can be more readily monitored			1
cosmetic surgeons will be forced to give patients more information about their treatments , for example warning women that breast implants are likely to need replacing every ten years			1
women who have booked surgery are likely to be offered a cooling off period to allow them to rethink whether they need the treatments			2
and those carrying out the procedures will have to provide far better aftercare			0
the crackdown aims to drive cowboy surgeons out of the industry and make it more difficult for inexperienced beauty parlour workers to give @entity11 jabs , dermal fillers or conduct laser hair removal			1
@entity11 can currently be injected by anyone who has done a half - day - long course in which they watch a demonstration and take a friend along to practise on – although the drug does need to be prescribed by a doctor			1
inexperienced : @entity11 can be injected by anyone who has undertaken a half - day - long course ( posed by models ) ‘ there is a case for tightening up so that practitioners have to acquire more rigorous qualifications , ’ a source said			1
some 45 per cent of women and one in four men say they have considered cosmetic surgery			1
but a poll conducted for the government has found that many consider the cost of surgery more important than the qualifications of the people doing it			2
some 67 per cent of those questioned consider cost as a factor when deciding whether or not to have cosmetic surgery			1
only 54 per cent take the qualifications of their practitioner into consideration			0
sir @entity16 will today announce the creation of an expert panel to consider how regulations can be tightened and patient care improved			0
the panel includes tv doctor @entity109 , @entity110 , a campaigner on @entity25 implants , plastic surgeon @entity112 and @entity113 , editor of @entity114			2
health secretary @entity27 ordered the review following fears over unsafe breast implants sir @entity16 said : ‘ the recent problems with @entity25 breast implants have shone a light on the cosmetic surgery industry			1
many questions have been raised , particularly around the regulation of clinics , whether all practitioners are adequately qualified , how well people are advised when money is changing hands , aggressive marketing techniques and what protection is available when things go wrong			2
‘ i am concerned that too many people do not realise how serious cosmetic surgery is and do not consider the life - long implications – and potential complications – it can have			1
' we want to hear views from everyone , particularly people who have experience of the cosmetic surgery industry or of other cosmetic interventions – good and bad – so we can learn what works best			1
’ concern grew late last year over @entity25 implants , which were made by @entity26 company @entity25			2
they were linked to the death of a @entity26 woman from a rare form of cancer , sparking worries among 47,000 @entity155 women who were thought to have had them			0
‘ we would like the review to take this opportunity to draw a clear line between cosmetic treatments that are seen as a commodity and cosmetic surgery that is a serious medical treatment which must be provided by fully - trained and qualified surgeons			1
’ professor @entity165 , president of the @entity166 , added : ‘ in an increasingly quick - fix and image - conscious society , it is quite easy to forget that cosmetic surgery has life - long implications			1
patients must be assured that the practitioners have the right qualifications and experience			0
’ @entity176 was devastated after discovering her breast implants had started to leak and would have to be removed			1
the 27 - year - old , who had @entity25 implants fitted privately in 2005 , first realised something was wrong when she began to feel pains in her left breast two years later			1
although she was told nothing was wrong , a scan showed the implant had ruptured			0
a second scan showed silicone had leaked into her lymph nodes			0
when her private clinic refused to remove the implants , the @entity15 paid for the bulk of the operation , with miss @entity176 contr - ibuting £ 750 towards new implants			2
the beautician and hairdresser from @entity199 said : ‘ i researched for a year before i had mine done because i wanted the best people			0
yet i still ended up with these problems			0
‘ it shows unless the industry is regulated you ’re still going to get these cowboys offering cheap , dangerous implants			2
’ @entity207 had a facelift which went wrong in january 2007			0
the mother of six from @entity210 , @entity211 , said : ‘ when i booked in for a facelift with a well - known surgery company five years ago , i simply wanted to refresh my looks			2
‘ but the surgeon doing my facelift botched the operation , damaging the nerve endings in my face and leaving half of it permanently paralysed			0
‘ now people stop me in the street and ask if i ’ve had a stroke or if i ’ve got @entity224			0
’ mrs @entity207 , 55 , is now in favour of tougher regulations for the industry			0
‘ i think all surgeons should be thoroughly vetted and have a long period of practice time where they are supervised by top cosmetic surgeons before they are let loose on the public , ’ she said			2
‘ i firmly believe cosmetic surgeons should n’t have free rein to play @entity236 because people like me have to deal with the consequences			0
five years on , i ’m still suffering from the effects of my botched facelift			0
because of the nerve damage , my forehead often throbs in pain and tingles when it ’s cold			0
’ @entity245 decided to have breast implants and liposuction to make herself ‘ feel better ’ when her mother died 11 years ago			1
after seeing an advert for a leading clinic , the 38 - year - old booked an appointment that @entity253 , a former nurse who lives with her husband @entity255 , 40 , and their son @entity256 , 11 , in @entity257 , claims she felt pushed into booking procedures during the first consultation			0
just two weeks later , she was having implants , a breast uplift and liposculpture around her thighs , hips and stomach			2
within days , the scars under her breasts had gone lumpy and some of her skin had turned a grey colour			0
she was so depressed she was prescribed anti-depressants by her gp			0
mrs @entity253 said : ‘ i had days where i cried , feeling guilty			0
if the government changes the law , i ’d back it 100 per cent			0
no firm should take payment on the day and there should be a 14 - day cooling off period			1
