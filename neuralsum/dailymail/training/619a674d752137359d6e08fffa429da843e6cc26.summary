by @entity0 published : 11:10 est , 22 november 2013 updated : 13:52 est , 22 november 2013 journalist @entity1 has spoken out on the anniversary of president @entity4 's death saying that she does n't believe the conspiracy theories			1
both of @entity1 ' parents were members of @entity8 at the time of the assassination and her father was a member of the official committee tasked with investigating the murder			1
even though her father , @entity15 congressman @entity14 , was reportedly unconvinced about the @entity17 's reliance on the ' single bullet ' theory , today @entity1 said that belief in the conspiracy theories is effectively a coping mechanism			1
it 's so much easier to believe in a conspiracy bc its rational , ' she said during an interview on @entity43			0
her father was a leader in @entity8 and accompanied the speaker to @entity45 to receive @entity46 and the president 's casket when it arrived from @entity50			2
newly - elected president @entity51 later called congressman @entity52 at their family home in @entity55 to ask him to join the investigating committee , which went on to be referred to as the @entity17			1
' i can remember my father so well saying " we need a blue ribbon commission to put everything to rest so the @entity62 people know we have examined every possibility and we know exactly what happened " and of course that did n't happen , ' ms @entity1 said			2
searching : after nearly a year - long investigation , the @entity17 ( featuring @entity52 , right ) produced a 889 - page report asserting that @entity69 acted alone and a ' single bullet ' was used to hit both @entity4 and @entity71 political family : @entity1 was the youngest child ( seen at right in 1947 ) of congresswoman @entity52 ( left ) and congressman @entity14 ( center ) , both @entity15 from @entity55 ' now , he was somewhat skeptical of the single bullet theory and basically he signed the commission report and of course it was unanimous			1
' she went on to concede : ' it 's somewhat difficult to see the bullet taking that trajectory			0
' ' since then we have n't learned anything more that would indicate anything else			0
' @entity88 on @entity89 in 1978 with much more technology to examine these things basically came to the same conclusion right up to the last minute when they heard an acoustical report that - to them - sounded like to guns			0
that report has been discredited			0
' the @entity17 produced an 889 - page report and passed their findings on to president @entity4 on september 24 , 1964			1
fatal ride : president @entity4 was shot and killed during a motorcade in @entity50 they asserted that @entity69 acted alone in killing the president , and nightclub owner @entity103 acted alone in killing @entity69 before he could stand trial			2
more than a decade later , the @entity105 used improved technology			0
while they conceded that @entity69 did act alone , they did think that @entity69 was motivated by a conspiracy			0

@entity1 ' father was congressman @entity14 who was *selected* to serve on the investigating committee
@entity52 was skeptical of the single bullet theory but ended up signing the @entity17 report anyway
single bullet theory argues that @entity4 and @entity121 *governor* @entity71 were shot with the same bullet
