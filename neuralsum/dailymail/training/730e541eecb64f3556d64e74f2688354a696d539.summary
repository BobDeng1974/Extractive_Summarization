the amount a typical household is able to pay to cover all its necessities and luxuries has dropped by nearly 10 per cent since the onset of the recession			2
an average home had almost £ 50 a week less to spend last year than it did in 2006 , once inflation has been taken into account			1
rising costs : transport is the largest cost the @entity19 family faces as they battle to make ends meet and families ’ real buying power is now back to the levels of 1996 and 1997 , just before the long boom which ended in the banking collapse of 2007 and 2008			1
family expenditure has now declined in real terms for five years in a row – the greatest blow to living standards since official surveys on household spending began in the 1950s			1
the figures compiled by the @entity34 show that in 2006 a typical family was spending £ 533 a week at 2011 prices			1
that dropped steadily through the recession to £ 483.60 last year			2
the fall since 2006 amounts to 9.3 per cent and means that households on average are able to spend £ 49.40 a week less now than they could then			1

‘ the recession of the 1970s was relatively shallow			0
the early 1980s recession was not , but we were out of it in four years			0
the 1990s recession hit house prices , but it only lasted three years			0
‘ this time it seems there is no chance of recovery before 2015			0
’ in bald figures , average family spending went up by £ 10 a week in the year between 2010 and 2011			1
but that does not take account of inflation and does not reflect families ’ real spending power			0
over the past year , weekly spending in real terms fell by £ 14.60			1
expensive : running a family car is getting more and more expensive because of fuel and insurance costs the inflation - adjusted figures showing six years of spending decline are unmatched since the survey began			1
other real terms spending declines were reported in the recession years of 1974 , 1980 and 1981 , and 1991			0

the wealthiest 10 % of households have almost £ 1 million in cash and assets , while the top 1 % have more than £ 2.8 million			0
@entity86 general secretary @entity85 said : ' these regional inequalities are making whole areas of the country unaffordable , creating employment blackspots in other parts and are holding back our economy			0
' although survey methods used to measure family spending have been changed over the past 15 years , the figures indicate that the last time outgoings fell below £ 490 a week was in the financial year 1996/97 , when the economy was still recovering from the recession of the early 1990s			1
the @entity34 survey covered the spending of 26,000 homes			0
it follows checks on how families spend their money – made by asking people to keep weekly spending diaries – which have been carried out annually since 1957			0
the biggest rise in costs in cash terms was for cars , car insurance , maintenance and fuel , which rose to £ 65.70 per week , up 80p from the previous year			1
recreation and culture , including tickets for the cinema and sporting events , took up the next highest chunk of families ’ spending , costing £ 63.90 a week on average			1
housing – excluding mortgage payments – fuel and power came next at £ 63.30 a week in 2011 , a weekly increase of £ 2.90			1
the richest 10 per cent of homes can afford to spend more than £ 1,000 a week , the @entity34 report said , including nearly £ 100 a week on restaurants and hotels			2
those whose incomes are in the bottom third spend a total of only £ 260.70 a week .			2

it cost £ 483.80 a week to run a @entity19 home in 2011
transport cost £ 65.70 - the biggest household expense
rising cost of fuel and insurance blamed
spending on *clothes* , shoes and *furniture* falls
