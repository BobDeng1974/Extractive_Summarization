when it comes to making public apologies , politicians have often been criticised for lacking sincerity			0
but one politician in @entity5 has taken things to the other extreme after breaking down and wailing hysterically on live tv while apologising over claims he wasted public money			2
@entity12 , 47 , burst into tears and began banging on his desk and jabbering nonsensical phrases during a news conference on tuesday			1
the conference followed a @entity37 newspaper report that raised questions about mr @entity12 visiting the hot springs 106 times last year , using public money			1
such visits were not illegal and had been reported to the assembly office , but cost three million yen ( £ 17,500 )			1
@entity29 legislators get 500,000 yen ( £ 3,000 ) a month for expenses , including travel , but the spending is supposed to be for official travel , research and other costs related to the activities of elected office			0
during the apology @entity12 wailed hysterically , banging his desk and shouting nonsensical phrases the apology has caused controversy in conservative @entity5 where outbursts of emotion are frowned upon mr @entity12 , who does not belong to a major political party , was found to have gone to other day trips , racking up expenses , including visits to @entity61 and the south - western city of @entity63			1
of his 195 day trips , ones to the ' onsen ' hot - springs resort town of @entity68 , which lies outside his precinct , were the most frequent			0
the video of his apology has since become an online hit , with nearly 2million views so far on @entity74			0
however people in @entity5 have reacted with anger to the apology as public outbursts of emotion are generally frowned upon in the conservative country			0
shame : at another point during the broadcast , @entity12 took a deep breath before bowing his head while the visits to the hot springs were not illegal , they did cost three million yen ( £ 17,500 ) last month a @entity61 assemblyman was forced into a humiliating public apology after shouting a sexist remark at a female colleague			1
@entity93 was making a presentation on issues such as infertility and maternal support when hecklers called out ' you are the one who should get married first ' , ' she must be single ' and ' ca n't you even have babies ? '			0
@entity103 , 51 , admitted making the first comment and bowed to @entity93 at a press conference , though insisted he had not meant to offend her .			2
