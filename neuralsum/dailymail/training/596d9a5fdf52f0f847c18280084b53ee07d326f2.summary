by @entity0 published : 10:10 est , 28 may 2012 updated : 10:15 est , 28 may 2012 transplant surgeons have carried out a record - breaking live liver transplant operation to save a young man on the verge of death			1
@entity6 , 24 , had just hours to live when surgeons got the go - ahead to transplant a slice of liver from his best friend			1
normally such operations take weeks of planning			0
but in just 48 hours , @entity14 underwent a range of medical tests and a battery of psychological interviews to allow him to donate			1
close : @entity6 ( right ) had just hours to live when surgeons got the go - ahead to transplant a slice of liver from his best friend @entity23 ( left ) it is believed to be the first time a live liver transplant has been approved so quickly			1
a team of doctors , scientists , transplant co-ordinators and medical ethicists at @entity33 ’s @entity32 worked at break - neck speed to make it possible for mr @entity14 to give a chunk of his liver			1
mr @entity6 did not have time on his side - he was literally on the edge of death when liver surgeons decided that his closest friend , also 24 , was his only hope of survival			1
professor @entity46 , who carried out the transplant , said : ' i ca n’t recall a live case where we ’ve operated so quickly			1
' this was a patient needing a live transplant so urgently that we had no more than a couple of days to go through loads of tests and paper work			1
' even though there was extreme urgency everything had to be done by the book			0
' one minute mr @entity6 , from @entity61 , @entity62 , was relatively well			1
the next , doctors at the @entity32 were giving him just days to live			2
he said : ' i had been diagnosed with liver failure for a few months and the doctors were talking of a transplant with a dead donor liver some time in the future			1
' but then i became very ill over the period of just a few days			0
in the end i was hanging on to life with my liver completely shot through			2
' race against time : the best friends pose with the team of doctors , scientists , transplant co-ordinators and medical ethicists from @entity33 's @entity32 nobody knows why mr @entity6 , who was fit and healthy , developed liver failure or why he suddenly became critically ill. friends and family offered to donate at short notice - just a week before the transplant			1
but all were found to be unsuitable			0
professor @entity46 said : ' patients who are stable with liver disease can suddenly drop over the edge			2
' we were faced with a situation where we needed someone close to give @entity6 a liver at very short notice			1
we were n’t going to find a dead donor			0
' it ’s not the way we normally work with live donors it was an unusual situation and we had to respond by working very quickly			2
it was a fantastic team effort			0
' even though a life is in the balance we can not cut corners			0
there are a lot of processes to be gone through when someone gives a slice of their liver as a donor			1
' but somehow we managed to get it all done between a friday night and a monday morning			0
' all the time we were conscious that with every hour that passed we might lose @entity6			2
he was that ill he could have gone at any time			0
' @entity115 : mr @entity14 and mr @entity6 with professor @entity46 ( right ) , who carried out the transplant when everyone had been tested , the only satisfactory match for mr @entity6 was his childhood friend mr @entity14 , also from @entity61			1
he said : ' @entity6 ’s sister was the nearest after me but she did n’t quite match up			2
so it was down to me			0
' i had made my mind up anyway but there was n’t much time to think about it			0
' i would do anything for @entity6 but i never thought i ’d be the only match for a transplant ahead of his family			1
it was a shock when they told me			0
' the transplant took place in mid-february and both men are now fighting fit and happily sporting their fading scars			2
the liver is the only organ in the body capable of regeneration , and in just three months mr @entity14 ’s liver has re-grown			1
live donors almost always come from a family member and are normally from adult to child			2
mr @entity6 said : ' i will never forget what @entity14 has done			1
we are now even closer than ever			0
' i was really on my way out			0
i discovered just how near i had been to death after i came round			0
' the doctors said my old liver was virtually lifeless			0
i was running on empty when @entity14 came to my rescue			2
i had run out of time			0
he was my only hope			0

@entity6 , 24 , had just hours to live when surgeons got the go - ahead to transplant a slice of liver from his best friend
@entity14 , also 24 , underwent a range of medical and psychological tests before he was allowed to donate
