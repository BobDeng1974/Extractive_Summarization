@entity0 made significant improvements to the battery life of its @entity3 , but they still fail to last more than a full day with typical usage			1
to address these issues , the tech giant is recruiting for battery and power software experts			2
at least nine job listings have been spotted on the firm 's official recruitment site as the company looks to boost the battery across its range of mobiles and laptops			2
fan site @entity17 has spotted nine job listings on @entity0 's official recruitment site in the past month that relate to batteries			1
these include one for an @entity24 battery life software engineer ( pictured left ) and another for @entity26 power systems engineer ( pictured right ) the job listings were discovered by fan site @entity17 and include listings for an @entity24 battery life software engineer , a software power systems engineer , battery pack engineering manager and a cell engineer			1
in particular , the @entity24 software power systems engineer role said the successful candidate ' will be working on design and development of software for triage of battery life issues , modeling of power consumed by different parts of the system , and analytics to understand large scale battery life trends			1
' @entity0 defines the @entity48 battery on its @entity50 product page			2
it says its all - day battery life is based on 18 hours of use			1
all - day battery life : this includes 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30 - minute workout with music			1
audio playback : the battery will last up to 6.5 hours when playing music			0
talk time : @entity0 said the watch can be used for up to three hours for calls			2
workout : during this test the watch lasted for seven hours when a workout session was active and the heart rate sensor was on			0
watch : when used as a watch the device will last for 48 hours if checked five times an hour			0
power reserve : when the @entity67 's battery gets low it switches into @entity78 mode letting users tell the time for up to 72 hours - with four time checks an hour			2
charging time : the company said it takes 1.5 hours to charge the watch to 80 % and 2.5 hours for a full charge			0
@entity0 's tests were carried out in march 2015 with a pre-production @entity67 and software paired with an @entity3 using pre-production software			1
@entity0 said battery life varies with environmental factors , use , configuration , and ' many other factors ' so actual results will vary as the site suggests , this shows @entity0 is looking to boost the battery on @entity24 devices but also its range of @entity99			1
@entity0 's larger @entity3 have been found to last about eight hours with heavy usage and up to 22 hours with normal usage - although its difficult to quantify what ' normal usage ' is and this can differ from person to person			1
these times have only been beaten by @entity109 's latest @entity108			0
@entity0 also said its new 12 - inch @entity110 uses 30 per cent less energy than the previous model and could last more than nine hours on a single charge			2
however , official figures suggest its watch in particular will struggle to last for anywhere near that long			0
boss @entity117 said at the launch event last month that the watch will last 18 hours , but this only includes 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30 - minute workout with music			0
@entity0 is expected to launch an @entity126 , @entity127 as well as potentially a four - inch model later this year			2
battery improvements could be made to these handsets , or they may be a feature on next year 's @entity132			0
alternatively , because a number of the jobs refer to a software rather than hardware engineer , these battery improvements could be made and rolled out to existing phones as part of an @entity24 upgrade			1
earlier this week @entity141 released its latest microcontrollers ( @entity143 ) for a variety of gadgets that are so low power they can harvest energy from a person 's body			0
the @entity152 microcontrollers are part of @entity141 's 32 - bit @entity155 - based @entity143 range and are powered by chip maker @entity155 's @entity156 + 32 - bit processors			0
a number of @entity0 devices , including the @entity160 and @entity161 are powered by chips based around @entity155 technology			2
@entity141 said its mcus extend ' battery life from years to decades , reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices such as fire alarms , healthcare , medical , wearable , and devices placed in rural , agriculture , offshore and other remote areas			1
' @entity0 's @entity3 and 6 @entity127 have been found to last about eight hours with heavy usage and up to 22 hours with normal usage - although its difficult to quantify what ' normal usage ' is and this can differ from person to person			1
@entity0 also said its new 12 - inch @entity110 ( pictured ) uses 30 % less energy than previous models @entity0 boss @entity117 said the watch 's ' all - day ' battery life lasts 18 hours with ' typical use ' - but official tests recently revealed this equates to just 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30 - minute workout with music			1
@entity0 defines the battery on its watch page and said a time check lasts four seconds they use a third of the power of rival chips and tests have shown they are the lowest power microprocessor ever made			1
the microcontrollers run on the firm 's @entity206 technology and @entity141 's @entity208 that makes different parts of the device work together to carry out tasks			0
by effectively ' sharing ' energy , the whole device uses less power and , subsequently , less battery			0
it can also manage how much energy is being used by other components to make them as efficient as possible			0
plus , the technology is so low power it can harvest energy from the body using changes in temperature			0
earlier this week @entity141 released its latest microcontrollers ( @entity143 ) for a variety of gadgets that are so low power they can even harvest energy from a person 's body			0
@entity141 said its mcus extend ' battery life from years to decades , reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices ' during a demonstration of the microcontrollers at this year 's @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity141 's director of product marketing demonstrated how he could power a radio by placing his hand on a panel			1
this panel recognised a change in temperature between the hand and the room and this was harvested to create charge			0

@entity254 spotted nine listings in the past month relating to batteries
these include one for an @entity24 battery life software engineer and another for @entity26 power systems engineer
@entity0 significantly improved the battery life on its @entity3
but it has been *criticised* for phones and *tablets* that only do *n't* last a day
