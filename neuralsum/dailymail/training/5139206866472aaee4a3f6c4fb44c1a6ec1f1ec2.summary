head coach @entity0 insists there will be no radical alterations to @entity4 's approach in the autumn tests despite the presence of innovative attack coach @entity7 at the squad 's preparation camp this week			1
@entity7 , the former @entity10 , @entity4 and @entity11 head coach , was invited to @entity4 's base in @entity13 on monday and tuesday so @entity0 and his coaching team can benefit from his experience			1
' i do n't want to create something that 's not there , ' @entity0 said			1
@entity4 head coach @entity0 instructs as his players are put through their paces at @entity22 former @entity4 head coach @entity7 ( middle ) was at @entity22 @entity4 pair @entity24 and @entity25 pass the ball during tuesday 's training session ' it 's for me to sit down and chat			1
different ideas , different perspective			0
' he 's developed a lot of players , but actually he 's developed a lot of coaches			0
he 's somebody i 've always stayed in contact with			0
' he 's a very creative attacking coach ( but ) we 're not going to change anything we 're not already doing			2
' i think the way in which we try and play the game will remain the same			0
' the 68 - year - old @entity7 , now coaching @entity42 - based @entity41 of @entity43 in the @entity44 , coached @entity4 to the 2007 @entity46 final and @entity0 knows his side need to develop if they are to beat reigning world champions @entity48 in the opening international of the season on november 8			1
' in terms of our attacking mindset , i think we 've always had a strong one , ' @entity0 said			1
' we need to beat @entity48 by scoring tries as well as kicking points			2
' the @entity48 are the first opponents of an autumn schedule which sees @entity60 ( november 15 ) , @entity61 ( november 22 ) and @entity62 ( november 29 ) - opponents in @entity64 at the @entity66 - visit @entity65			2
@entity67 is the biggest fitness concern due to a hand injury the @entity71 centre suffered playing against the @entity72			1
@entity0 conceded @entity67 , who met a specialist on tuesday following a scan , is unlikely to face the @entity48			1
@entity67 is set to miss @entity4 's clash with @entity76 after sustaining a hand injury for @entity71 the centre is still to join up with @entity4 's squad and will see a specialist on tuesday to discuss a scan @entity0 , who revealed the prognosis was more encouraging than first feared and that surgery would not be required , said : ' he 's not been in camp this week at all			1
he 's still in the equation further down the line			0
he 's definitely not out the series			0
' potentially he could come back into camp next week , but he wo n't have done any of the work			2
it would be a big step to put him in ( against @entity48 )			1
' @entity4 's other wounded players - @entity98 prop @entity100 ( quad ) , @entity105 number eight @entity103 ( concussion ) , @entity107 ( ribs ) , @entity98 wing @entity96 ( ankle ) , @entity94 back row @entity92 ( virus ) and @entity10 prop @entity109 ( calf ) - are expected to play a full part in training from next monday at the latest			2
@entity42 is pleased with the opportunity to work with his players for a lengthy duration			0
' it means that if players are required to come in , they are up to speed straight away , ' he added			0
the @entity48 and other touring opposition have been entwined in international camps for some time , but @entity0 insists his squad 's knowledge - base has developed from every spell as a group since his appointment in early 2012			1
' the @entity48 , the @entity128 , since the @entity130 final , have been in camp - that 's a 2.5 months camp , ' @entity0 said			1
' their cohesion and understanding of their structures would be enhanced			0
' but you could argue it the other way : they are at the end of a long , hard season and we are fresh at the start of ours			0
' we have been together now for 2.5 years ; every time we return , we are at the point we left because the players remember and we do n't have to go back to square one			0
@entity150 passes the ball during the @entity4 training session @entity4 trained in @entity13 where the team 's brand new gym complex and @entity156 pitch are located ' we are another level up to this time last year			1
mainly because the players are similar - consistency in selection			0
' whilst the starting xv changes , generally the group is the same faces			0
' @entity0 knows this autumn is about a fine balance - giving his fringe players the @entity167 experience they need while developing a winning mentality and a momentum which he wishes to take into @entity46 year			2
' you do n't want to compromise your team because ultimately it comes down to winning , ' @entity0 added			1
the pivotal fly - half position provokes a challenge as @entity105 ' @entity25 has just returned from a thigh problem and @entity10 's @entity176 is keen to get a chance to claim the number 10 jersey			0
@entity25 has 26 caps and @entity180 two , while @entity181 has one , and @entity42 could provide a chance for the less experienced pair			0
' @entity176 has now established himself there ( in the @entity185 ) , so the next step is to get him those international caps , ' @entity0 said			2
@entity188 is soon to be a team - mate of @entity180 's at @entity190 having made a high - profile transfer from rugby league			2
@entity42 is not about to meddle in his imminent arrival to union , adding : ' i 'm sure he 'll have one eye on our games , but i think he 'll need to get bedded in at @entity10			0
' @entity25 of @entity105 catches the ball during an @entity4 training session at @entity22 @entity176 of @entity10 runs the ball during a session at @entity203 on monday			1
