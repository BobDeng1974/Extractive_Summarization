a @entity1 couple who have been trying for over seven years to have a child may finally get that chance thanks to a crowdsourced egg donor			1
@entity5 and @entity6 put out a desperate call earlier this month after nine failed rounds of @entity9 and one failed egg donor attempt			1
after sharing their story with a @entity1 radio station the couple were inundated with women willing to help them realise their dream of starting a family			1
thanks to @entity20 , 22 , who said she has wanted to be an egg donor for many years , that dream could soon be a reality			1
' there were no ifs or buts about it : we wanted kids , that was just a natural progression but that did n't quite happen , ' mrs @entity30 said			1
' i 've got a couple of challenges , i 've got low ovarian reserves so i have n’t had a cycle for 16 months ... i 've also got an aggressive immune system in my uterus , ' she added			0
' its an understatement to say it ’s been an adjustment , ' mr @entity6 told @entity31			1
' you sort of get married and think right we ’ll start a family and it ’s just a matter of doing what you ’re doing and nine months later a kid comes out			2
after first attempting artificial insemination , then turning to @entity9 in 2009 and attempting to conceive via an egg donor last year , the couple felt as though they were coming to the end of the road			1
mrs @entity30 , 38 , told @entity31 she and @entity6 have been trying to conceive since they were married ' its an understatement to say it ’s been an adjustment , ' mr @entity6 told @entity31 a call - out on their local radio station put the @entity73 in touch with @entity20 , who they asked to be their donor but a call - out on their local radio station put them in touch with @entity20 , who already has a two - year - old son			1
ms @entity20 , 22 , told @entity31 egg donation was something she 'd always wanted to do , and after the birth of her son she wanted to give someone else the opportunity to experience the same ' sacred ' bond			1
' i conceived my son while on @entity91 ( a contraceptive implant ) , from there my partner and i decided we were n't in a position to bring a child into the world , ' she said			0
ms @entity20 revealed that she and her partner at the time made the difficult decision to terminate the pregnancy , but that did n't go to plan either			2
' we had the needle to terminate and everything that was supposed to happen happened , ' she said			0
but three months later the then 20 - year - old was told the termination had n't worked , and she was still pregnant			0
' at that stage a three - month baby is everything , there ’s fingers and toes			0
i thought i 'm going to do this , i 'm going to have the baby , i ’m going to prove everyone wrong , ' ms @entity20 said			2
ms @entity20 said she wants to enable others to experience the miracle of having a child she conceived her son while on contraception but said she would n't change it for the world ' and now i have a very happy and healthy two year old			2
' her experience with son @entity29 made the 22 - year - old ever more determined to share the gift of life with someone else and she had already begun the process of donating when she heard the @entity30 's story			1
before they can go ahead the trio need to undergo a number of counselling sessions with @entity137 , their clinical psychologist and a counsellor for @entity141 cases ( pictured ) ' i 'm thrilled i have the opportunity to give back , ' ms @entity20 said			2
' its sacred to carry a child			0
' mr and mrs @entity30 are equally as excited to have their egg donor 's assistance , and hope this may finally help them realise their dream of having a family			1
' it ’s such a compassionate and beautiful things for people to even consider , ' mrs @entity30 said			2
before they can go ahead the trio need to undergo a number of counselling sessions , one which @entity161 will attend on their own , while ms @entity20 too has her own individual session			2
from there they will all have a group session , before a three - month ' cooling off period ' according to @entity137 , their clinical psychologist and a counsellor for @entity141 cases			0
' basically the primary goal is to prepare , check for ethical dilemmas , make sure that there ’s no coercion taking place , ' ms @entity137 told @entity31			0
' and pretty much just ensure there ’s informed consent about the psycho - social and legal implications , not just early on but later in life for the child			0
' ' the overall pictures is not to talk people in or out of being a donor but talk about informed consent , ' she added			0
as ms @entity20 is classified as a ' known donor ' , there also has to be in depth discussion about the role she would potentially play in the child 's life			1
the @entity193 said they wanted to share their story in order to raise awareness about egg donation ms @entity20 described the relationship between a parent and child as a ' sacred ' bond ' i just really believe that you do n’t know what true love is until you hold your baby for the first time , ' she said while this could finally mean the @entity73 can start their family , mrs @entity30 said the situation is bigger than her and ms @entity211			1
there is a lack of egg donors in @entity215 , and she hopes by sharing her story it will help raise awareness and encourage people to consider donating			0
waiting lists are long and women can sit on them for years to no avail			1
' there ’s just not enough awareness about egg donors in @entity215 , ' she said			0
' you can go out and there ’s a lot of awareness about blood donation , but not egg donation			0
' mrs @entity30 said she and her husband were prepared to go overseas for a donor before they were put in touch with one in @entity215			1
the trio have to undergo counselling and a three month ' cooling off ' period before they can go ahead when asked what it would mean to them should everything go ahead , @entity238 and mrs @entity30 both agreed the situation would be surreal			2
' it ’s going to be so surreal that it ’s actually happened because we 've been on this journey for such a long time , ' mrs @entity30 said			1
' you 've got a goal that seems unattainable and when it finally comes off i can image it would feel very surreal , ' her husband agreed			0
ms @entity20 said after sharing her story on @entity253 earlier this week she has been contacted by dozens of women commending her on a ' brave ' decision to donate her eggs			2
but she does n't see it as courageous			0
' i just really believe that you do n’t know what true love is until you hold your baby for the first time , ' she said			0
' my question is n't why would i , but why would n't i ' .			0
