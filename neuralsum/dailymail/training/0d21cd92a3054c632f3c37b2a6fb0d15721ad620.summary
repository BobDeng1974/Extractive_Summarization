former @entity1 government minister @entity0 says people on welfare payments should take contraception or lose their right to any benefit payments			1
he told @entity7 that the radical proposal would apply to anyone applying for unemployment payments ( or other government assistance ) and they must provide proof from a doctor of their contraception plan or forfeit access to the taxpayer money			1
writing in the @entity19 newspaper mr @entity0 , who was a former minister in the @entity21 , stated that ' if a person 's sole source of income is the taxpayer , the person , as a condition of benefit , must have contraception '			1
people assume that someone has a right to a benefit , but all benefits come with obligations and this is another obligation and not a particularly difficult one ' he also wrote that ' such a measure will undoubtedly affect strugglers , it undoubtedly will affect @entity45 and @entity46 people in great proportions , but the idea that someone can have the taxpayer , as of right , fund the choice to have a child is repugnant '			2
in his column he cited the @entity61 massacre as an example , ' a single mother with nine children from five fathers ... better this woman had fewer children '			1
however , he told @entity7 that did not mean he thought the tragedy would have been avoided had his plan been in place			2
' we simply use this as an example but i do n’t suggest i know all the background , ' mr @entity0 said			1
' it is highly probable that a person who would have fewer children and indeed is left on her own to bring them up would be better served if they were given access to long term contraception			1
' i can not make an explicit connection to that case but we all know of other instances of very large families			0
it was a terrible situation ( in @entity61 )			1
' the mother of seven of the children and aunt to the eighth , @entity87 , 37 , has been charged with eight counts of murder			1
the father of three children ( second from right ) who were among eight children allegedly murdered by their mother , attends a memorial service in @entity61 the tight - knit community in @entity61 has been devastated by the murders of eight children			1
@entity0 wrote in defending his call for no dole payments to those who do n't take contraception ' better this woman had fewer children			1
. better men on benefits also could be prevented from having children ' mr @entity0 , 62 , was special minister of state in the @entity106			1
as for how such a plan would be implemented , he stressed it would be for new applicants only			2
' this is the first point , ' he said			0
' while we wish men to be responsible , we do know that women can access certain contraceptive drugs			2
' so when a person applies for a benefit you have to bring along a note from the doctor , that i have now taken the following drug , and will remain on it while i am on the dole			1
' most people are not on the dole for that long , that ’s a simple thing , and this is about making people make the connection in their mind			2
. to say " hello , i am in strife here " and it 's not about getting money for having a child			0
' they must know that falling pregnant while on a benefit can harm me			0
i am actually interested in the kids already born into a poor family			0
' ' it is simply a conversation that we need to have , it 's about inter-generational poverty			0
' mr @entity0 has called for bi-partisan support			2
' of course all parliamentarians should consider this			0
people assume that someone has a right to a benefit , but all benefits come with obligations and this is another obligation and not a particularly difficult one			0
' for some women they may not know the access they can have to contraception			2
' as to when benefits would be cut off should parents fail to adhere to such an agreement			0
' you would always err on the side of generosity but not to the point where you nullify the whole effect , this is not about punishing			0
' there is plenty of support ( for his proposal )			0
. this just needs a calm conversation and i think we will have it , people are thinking bloody hell what do we do and we are getting a little bit sick of the next charitable group coming forward and saying give me more money			0
' what we are saying now is what about an ounce of prevention ? '			0

@entity0 says that if you ca n't prove you are on contraception plan then you do n't get dole payments
the former labor minister wants women to provide proof from their doctor to @entity196 before they are granted welfare benefits
claims a @entity61 woman charged with the murder of eight children would have been better off with ' fewer children '
