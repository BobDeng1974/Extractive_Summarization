its history is steeped in bloody battle , treachery and intrigue			0
a thousand years after @entity5 built it , @entity7 is still at the centre of drama			0
there ’s not so much gore and murder these days , but feelings are certainly running high amid fears of a new kind of invader laying siege to the castle walls … glampers			0
local burghers are considering whether to approve plans for 20 medieval - style lodges , five tree houses and 41 glamping tents and a banquet area in the castle ’s historic grounds			1
families can book one of the tents , some of which come with their own four - poster beds , for between £ 160 and £ 200 a night			0
but now the firm has lodged larger plans with @entity58 to create a permanent holiday village on the banks of the @entity61			1

and granting this application would be another nail in the coffin of @entity7 as a historic town and of the castle as a place abounding in history			0
’ account manager @entity118 , 45 , added : ‘ from the plans the lodges look beautiful and in a tranquil spot , yet in reality what you will have is a glorified @entity80 holiday park overshadowing a wonderful castle			1
‘ the whole character of the castle will be lost if this goes ahead which will be a real shame			0
