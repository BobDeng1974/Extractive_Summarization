@entity1 prosecutors have won their bid to appeal the culpable homicide verdict handed down to @entity5 athlete @entity4 for killing his girlfriend and will now seek a murder conviction			1
' i can not say the prospect of success at the @entity11 is remote , ' said @entity13 high court judge @entity12 in granting the appeal			2
prosecution lawyers applied for leave to appeal after judge @entity12 in october sentenced the @entity5 gold medallist to five years in jail after a trial that attracted worldwide interest			1
the state lost an application to challenge that sentence - although it could still petition that decision			1
after a seven - month trial , judge @entity12 found him guilty of culpable homicide , equivalent to the @entity38 crime of manslaughter , after throwing out a more serious charge of murdering miss @entity29			1
state prosecutor @entity41 said in his application to appeal on tuesday that the judgement was ' shockingly inappropriate ' and requested permission to seek a murder conviction , which would carry a minimum 15 year jail term			1
@entity1 's state prosecutor @entity41 arrives at the high court in @entity13 , @entity1 , today @entity48 argued that even if @entity4 did not know @entity29 was behind the door when he fired , the athlete showed intent to kill whoever was in the small toilet cubicle			1
@entity4 's jail term will not be extended unless the state convinces the @entity56 to overturn the original culpable homicide verdict			1
@entity58 , of @entity1 law firm @entity59 , said an appeal court will decide whether or not judge @entity12 made a mistake in her interpretation of the law when she handed found @entity4 guilty of culpable homicide			1
if the panel decides judge @entity12 did err , they will look back at the facts presented in the original trial and could then convict @entity4 of murder if they decide the facts of the case support that , mr @entity58 said			1
@entity72 , the prosecution spokesman , said he hopes the appeal will be ' expedited ' but acknowledged that the process can take a long time			0
in arguing for an appeal , the prosecution said the judge incorrectly interpreted a legal principle			0
under that principle , a person should be found guilty of murder if he foresaw the possibility of a person dying because of his actions and went ahead anyway			0
' we 're happy , ' mr @entity72 said after the hearing			0
@entity4 now faces the prospect of a murder conviction			1
once prosecutors appeal the conviction , the appeals court will review the case to determine if the verdict was appropriate			1
@entity4 could be out of jail and serving out the rest of his five - year sentence on house arrest by the time prosecutors can appeal his conviction , an expert said today			1
@entity101 , a top @entity1 criminal advocate , said the appeal was n't likely to be heard until summer 2015			0
@entity4 was sentenced to five years in jail on october 21 , but according to @entity1 law he can be eligible for release to house arrest after serving just one - sixth of that sentence , equivalent to 10 months			1
that means that if the @entity110 agrees he 's no longer a risk to the public @entity4 could be out by august 21			2
mr @entity101 said the appeal was likely to be heard by @entity1 's @entity56 in @entity113			0
' there 's a big question mark over the meaning of dolus eventualis , ' he said , referring to the legal principle the interpretation of which lies at the heart of the appeal			0
' whether she ( judge @entity12 ) applied it correctly or not is the issue			0
' the @entity56 will want it because they want to clear up exactly what it means			0
' addressing judge @entity12 in the same @entity13 courtroom where the murder trial was conducted , prosecutor @entity41 yesterday said she had made a mistake in her interpretation of the law			2
he told her : ' there is a very good prospect that we may convince an appeal court that the shortest possible incarceration in a case like this , my lady , is shockingly inappropriate			2
' ahead of the application , miss @entity29 's mother , june , said she hoped any appeal hearings would finally get to the truth about her daughter 's death			1
she told @entity149 from @entity150 : ' i wanted the truth ( at the trial ) , but it seems some of the puzzle is missing			0
' there 's only two people who know what happened			0
one of them 's my daughter and she 's not here anymore			0
' she said an extended prison sentence for the athlete would not make the grieving process any easier for the family			2
mrs @entity29 added : ' what difference is it going to make to me ? i wanted to see him go down the steps [ to the court cells ]			2
' so it does n't really matter how long - he 's going to know that he ca n't go around hurting people			0
' mrs @entity29 and her husband @entity173 previously said they felt ' let down ' by @entity1 's justice system after @entity4 was acquitted of murder			1
in a bizarre twist , @entity177 , one of @entity1 's leading defence lawyer who specialises in murder trials , said @entity4 could apply for bail even though it ' would cause a public outcry '			2
he told @entity184 : ' they could reasonably ask the court why must their client wait a year or more in custody while waiting for an appeal against his conviction and sentence			1
' the prosecution are appealing against his conviction and sentence and he could end up with a lesser sentence than the one that was handed down			0
' ' shockingly inappropriate sentence ' : addressing judge @entity12 in the same @entity13 court where the murder trial was conducted , prosecutor @entity41 ( above ) said she had erred in her interpretation of the law judge @entity12 ( above ) granted the appeal and the case will now be heard in @entity1 's @entity56 in @entity113 , the country 's judicial capital another lawyer said the decision to throw out the @entity208 murder trial in @entity209 yesterday may have a bearing on the appeal because the courts would want to show they are rigorous and fair			1
prosecutor @entity41 argued in appeal papers filed last month that judge @entity12 misinterpreted the law when she ruled @entity4 did not intentionally shoot @entity214 , describing the sentence as ' shockingly light ' and ' inappropriate '			1
@entity4 , a @entity1 athletics superstar after the double amputee competed against able - bodied runners in the @entity219 , can qualify for house arrest after serving one sixth of his sentence - 10 months - behind bars , which would mean he could serve the majority of his time outside prison walls			2
should judge @entity12 grant the appeal , the case will be heard in @entity1 's @entity56 in @entity113 , the country 's judicial capital			2
@entity29 's parents @entity231 and @entity233 , previously said they felt ' let down ' by @entity1 's justice system after @entity4 was acquitted of murder , bit found guilty of manslaughter @entity237 said that with the decision of a @entity209 court yesterday to throw out the @entity208 case - another high - profile murder trial involving a beautiful young woman killed in the dead of night - @entity1 's courts need to demonstrate they are rigorous and fair			1
' from a perception point of view , both public and internationally , we need to tell everybody that we have a robust and effective legal system			0
' @entity4 , who celebrated his 28th birthday last month , has been serving his sentence in a @entity13 prison			2
behind bars : @entity4 admits shooting his girlfriend @entity29 ( pictured ) four times through a locked toilet door on @entity31 last year , telling the court he thought she was an intruder ' he 's encountering many beautiful stories from prisoners			1
there are people there who have committed crimes but whose lives have changed , ' said his older brother @entity268 , in an interview with you magazine , a @entity1 tabloid			0
@entity4 has been accused of receiving special treatment in @entity1 's notoriously corrupt prisons , where there is frequent reports of inmates using cellphones and even drinking alcohol behind bars			0
yet @entity268 dismissed claims his brother is living the good life , saying @entity4 relies on weekly 45 - minute visits with his family to leave cash at the canteen so he can supplement his standard prison diet with tasty snacks , including baked beans and canned pilchards			0
' he now lives moment by moment , ' said @entity268			0
' there 's no fairytale			0
