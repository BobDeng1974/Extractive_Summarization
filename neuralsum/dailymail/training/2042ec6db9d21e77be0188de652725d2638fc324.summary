super-sized bottles of cheap cider will be banned in a bid to tackle teenage drinking , under new @entity5 proposals set to be announced this week			1
shadow health secretary @entity6 wants to outlaw ' high - strength , ultra-low - priced white ciders ' sold in three litre bottles			1
mr @entity6 told @entity13 products like @entity14 , @entity10 and @entity11 were fuelling under - age binge drinking and alcohol addiction and needed to be tackled			1
shadow health secretary @entity6 wants to outlaw ' high - strength , ultra-low - priced white ciders ' sold in three litre bottles the @entity5 frontbencher said the high - strength ciders were cheaper than they used to be – meaning children could ' cobble together ' enough money to get drunk all nights of the week			1
he said children as young as ' 11 or 12 ' were regularly boozing after school in a way their parents ' generation would not have been able to afford			1
many ciders available at pocket money prices have an alcohol content of 7.5 per cent – well above the strength of mainstream cider products – costing as little as 20p a unit			1
he said the cost and strength of cider made it ' very attractive to under - age drinkers , and it is also a major drink of choice for addicts and street drinkers '			0
mr @entity6 told @entity13 : ' these cider products are particularly used by children because of their low price and high strength			1
' we 've worked it out at 20p a unit			0
we 're talking about which can be up to 7.5 per cent in strength but are retailing at £ 1.99 or less – and this is a two or three litre bottle			1
' young people can cobble together the money to get hold of them			2
mr @entity6 said the proposal was ' the start of the road ' for improving public health ' what we are trying to signal [ is that ] coming in with a sledgehammer approach and just hitting everybody – that just loses people			2
they think why is everyone being punished – what 's fair about that ? ' he added that the proposal was ' the start of the road '			0
but mr @entity6 all - but admitted he had gone boozing with his friends as a teenager			0
the former health secretary said : ' i think we all grow up , do n't we , and we learn as we go			1
' i was n't whiter than white in that respect			0
i did normal things that teenagers in the @entity80 do			0
' mr @entity6 pointed to a survey of white cider drinkers by @entity83 which found 50 per cent saying they drank more than three litres a day , and 42 per cent saying they had been drinking it for more than ten years			2
mr @entity6 is considering banning the sale of cider in bottles of more than one litre in size , or by taxing larger volume cider containers more heavily			2
the party is also looking at proposals to create a new cheap cider tax to increase the cost of cheap booze			2
a proposal to increase the minimum apple juice content that cider is required to contain will also be considered			0
this would increase the cost of producing white cider – forcing up the price in the supermarket			0
@entity5 said the ballooning cost of treating alcohol related illnesses meant tackling problem drinking was essential			1
the harmful use of alcohol costs the @entity112 in @entity113 around £ 3.5 billion a year and alcohol - related crime costs £ 11bn per year , the party said			0
one in five children who drink now consume 15 or more units per week – twice an adult woman 's weekly recommended limit			0
binge drinkers by 15 are four times more likely to be addicted in later life , and almost half of young people excluded from school in the @entity125 are regular drinkers .			0
