warning : pregnant women who eat too much - or too little - risk having a fat child , scientists have warned pregnant women who eat too much – or too little – risk having a fat child , scientists have warned			1
babies of women who do not gain enough weight are as likely to be obese as those whose mothers gain too much , they said			1
and surprisingly , the risk is higher for women who are a normal weight at the start of their pregnancy			1
with obesity taking up to nine years of a person ’s life and sowing the seeds of a host of health problems , @entity17 experts said it is imperative that women are given clear advice on how much weight to gain during pregnancy			1
the @entity30 researchers tracked the health of more than 4,000 pregnant women and their children			1
overall , some 20.4 per cent of boys and girls born to women who put more weight than advised in pregnancy were overweight or obese between the ages of two and five			2
this is similar to the 19.5 per cent of children born to women who gained less than the recommended amount of weight – and more than the 14.5 per cent among women who stuck to the guidelines			2
the figures for women who went into pregnancy at a healthy weight were particularly striking , the @entity46 reports			2
a slim woman who ate too much in pregnancy was 80 per cent more likely to have a fat child than one who ate the right amount			1
and one who ate too little was 63 per cent more likely to have a child who was overweight or obese			0
the finding that the children of slim women were particularly affected suggests that genes can not be completely blamed for the effect			0
risk : the risk is higher for women who are a normal weight when they become pregnant , they said ( file picture ) instead , it is thought that conditions in the womb programme the unborn child ’s metabolism for years to come			1
for instance , there could be long - lasting consequences for the unborn child ’s appetite control or storage of fat			2
researcher dr @entity79 , of the @entity80 in @entity81 , said : ‘ gaining either too little or too much weight in pregnancy may permanently affect mechanisms that manage energy balance and metabolism in the offspring , such as appetite control and energy expenditure			0
‘ this could potentially have long - term effects on the child ’s subsequent growth and weight			0
’ dr @entity95 , of the create fertility clinic in central @entity97 , said the study adds to increasing evidence that conditions in the womb can have long - lasting effects on the child ’s health			0
she added that it emphasises the importance of providing advice to women before and during pregnancy			0
@entity109 , of the @entity110 , said it is imperative that the @entity17 follows the @entity30 ’s lead in issuing clear advice on weight gain			0
the @entity115 simply advises that weight gain in pregnancy ‘ varies greatly ’ , with most women putting on between 22lb to 26lb			0
in contrast , the @entity30 advises how much women of different weights should gain			0
for instance , a woman who goes into pregnancy at a normal , healthy weight , should put on 11 to 20lb .			1

pregnant women who eat too much , or too little , risk having a fat child
the link is stronger if the woman is normal weight at start of pregnancy
