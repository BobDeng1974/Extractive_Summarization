published : 19:39 est , 18 march 2014 updated : 03:38 est , 19 march 2014 @entity3 women enjoy fewer years in retirement than those in most other @entity7 nations , a study has revealed			1
shorter lifespans and longer working lives mean a @entity3 woman can expect 22.1 years in retirement – five fewer than the 27.4 enjoyed by @entity13 women			1
experts say the gap is only going to increase due to the government ’s determination to raise the state pension age			0
widening gap : retirement is shorter for @entity3 women - and men - than those who live in many other developed countries the study , by the @entity23 , shows that men in the @entity3 fare slightly better when compared with other rich nations			1
but they can still expect a retirement lasting just 19.1 years – three and a half years shorter than their @entity13 counterparts			1
the retirement span of @entity3 men is slightly above the average for the @entity23 , which represents the top 34 industrialised countries			1
@entity3 women are in 22nd position , under the @entity23 average and below five countries which used to be behind the @entity36			1
the study , @entity38 , found that while life expectancy has surged in @entity3 over the past four decades , the rate is slower than it is for many of our competitors			0
life expectancy has risen by 9.2 years since 1970 in the @entity3 but in @entity13 it has gone up by 10 years and in @entity45 , 10.2			2
the study warns that the taxpayer will come under increasing pressure to support its older generation			0
in @entity3 , there are 3.5 working - age people per pensioner but by 2050 that will be just 2.2			0
@entity53 , a former @entity54 adviser , said : ‘ @entity3 women are poor relations on pensions both here and in @entity58 – and it is only going to get worse			2
‘ with the retirement age rising significantly , the differential in retirement span between @entity3 women and @entity58 women here is only going to widen			1
‘ on top of this , state pensions for women are much lower in @entity3 than elsewhere			2
’ the @entity23 report shows that @entity3 women tend to retire at the age of 63.2 , by which time their life expectancy is 85.3			1
this gives them a retirement span of 22.1 years			0
retirement rankings : @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 all outrank the @entity3 in terms of how long their women spend in reitrement across the @entity23 , the average retirement span is 22.5 years			1
but @entity13 women tend to retire at 60 , by which time their life expectancy is 87.4 , giving them a retirement span of 27.4 years			1
even former @entity85 bloc states such as @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity77 fare better than us , as does @entity89			0
@entity3 men tend to retire at the age of 63.7 , by which time they have a life expectancy of 82.8 , giving them a retirement span of 19.1 years – three fewer than women			2
@entity13 , again , does much better , with a retirement span of 22.6 years			2
@entity96 of the male league is @entity98 with a span of 23.4 years			0
but @entity3 men have longer retirements than the @entity23 average of 18.1 years			0
across the @entity23 , women tend to have 7.5 extra years in retirement than they did in 1970 , while men have eight more years			0
mrs @entity53 said : ‘ women in @entity3 are now working later because of the increase in state pension age and also , it is important to point out , because some like to earn the extra money			0
‘ this is not happening in some @entity58 countries but it is likely the state pension system and retirement ages there will turn out to be unsustainable			0

study shows that @entity3 women can expect a 22.1 - year retirement
the below - average figure is less than @entity76 , @entity78 and @entity86
@entity13 women top the rankings , with an average of 27.4 years after stopping work
