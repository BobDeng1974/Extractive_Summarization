@entity160 , and dr @entity45 , @entity161 the new health scare may bring back some painful memories for the former first lady , who suffered a large blood clot in her leg back in 1998			2
in a 2007 interview with the @entity94 , @entity20 called the 1998 clot ' the most significant health scare i 've ever had			2
' most clots in the legs are treated with six months of blood thinners to allow them to dissolve on their own and to prevent further clots from forming , he said			2
a clot in a lung or the brain is more serious			1
lung clots , called pulmonary embolisms , can be deadly , and a clot in the brain can cause a stroke			1
@entity20 's illness led her to cancel an overseas trip and scheduled testimony before @entity188 about the attack on the @entity191 @entity190 in @entity192 , @entity193			0
when her absence was reported , several pundits and newspapers accused @entity20 of making her illness seem worse than it was to dodge questions from lawmakers over the consulate attack , which claimed the lives of four @entity191 , including ambassador @entity203			0
the @entity204 called her concussion a ' head fake			2

a clot occurs when a blockage builds up , either from partial thrombus ( coagulated blood ) or an outside compression			0
when the vein becomes blocked , the coagulated blood may extend to veins draining the area , which could lead to a lack of oxygen and tissue death			0
for @entity20 , ' the particular vein they 're talking about , there are enough other areas for the blood to travel through so it does n't build up in the brain , ' dr @entity62 told @entity70			0
symptoms and signs can include headache , nausea , vomiting and seizures , although the condition was detected in @entity20 with a routine mri scan following her treatment for concussion			0

' you do n't typically see blood clots forming in veins after this sort of concussion , ' dr @entity62 said			0
' she is somebody who has formed these blood clots before			0
there are some people who more likely develop blood clots			0
does she clot more vigorously than normal ? that with the brain injury - the concussion - could have led to it			1
' the condition can be treated with blood thinners administered over several months until the clot breaks down			1
other treatments include using a shunt to drain pressure on the brain or surgery - yet doctors said neither are necessary for @entity20			1
' the most concerning thing was ... the fact that this could be a blood clot pushing on her brain , ' dr @entity62 said			1
' that 's not what this is			0
you would n't treat something like that with blood thinners			0
it 's not a mass or a collection of blood pushing on the brain but it is something you 'd want to address fairly quickly			0
