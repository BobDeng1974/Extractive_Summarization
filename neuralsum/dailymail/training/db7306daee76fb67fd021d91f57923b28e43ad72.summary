by @entity0 @entity1 has spoken of how he wants his grandchildren to grow up away from the ' soap opera ' of his family			1
the @entity6 singer made the admission in his first tv interview since his daughter @entity9 died in april , leaving her two young sons @entity11 and @entity12 - who were aged 11 months and 23 months - without a mother			1
in the moving conversation , the 62 - year - old told how he still breaks down uncontrollably three months after his daughter 's death , finding the emotional weight ' intolerable '			1
but he said the tragic circumstances could also now provide a chance for his grandchildren to live their own lives , untouched by his celebrity status			1
' my life has also seemed incredibly episodic , like a soap opera			0
' he continued : ' they 're so small the little chaps and i 'm not sure that they 'll have this craving to remember their mum and i think that 's healthy			2
' you know , they 're young enough - it 's a terrible expression - to be able to build emotional relationships away from the primary relationship with the mother			1
' i know that sounds very cold and empirical but obviously i 've had to think about it and so have @entity63 , their dad , and @entity66 and @entity67 , their grandparents , who are amazing people and doing fantastically with the guys			0
' so i do n't want them becoming wrapped up in the @entity1 life			2
it 's great in some respects , it 's appalling in other times and things			2
' the singer spoke almost three months to the day since miss @entity9 was found unconscious at her home in @entity79 , @entity80 , on april 7			1
father and daughter : @entity1 and @entity9			1
he said he was amazed by the impact she had on her generation emotional : the singer shared a hug with @entity44 's @entity43 almost three months to the day since miss @entity9 was found unconscious at her home in @entity79 , @entity80 , on april 7			1
he is devoting himself to his music he said he coped through his music but he and his family were still struggling			0
' there 's not many options , ' he said			0
' it 's intolerable , it 's very hard as , everybody must realise if it 's happened to them too			0
what else do you do ? you get on with it			0
' the 62 - year - old said he escapes the thoughts of @entity9 ' death through music , but this could also bring out his darkest emotions			1
' being on stage is entirely cathartic , ' he said			0
' it just clears your head ... when i come off stage i 'm physically exhausted and mentally clear			0
' the singer , whose first wife @entity115 died of a heroin overdose in 2000 , added : ' if i dwell on the words sometimes i find it hard to struggle through the song because they take on whole meanings i never meant when i wrote them			2
' speaking of the @entity6 ' no 13 single @entity124 , he said : ' i was writing about a girl i read about in one of the papers , a socialite , and she went to a posh party and went upstairs and she hanged herself during the party			2
opening up : the @entity6 singer , whose appearance was timed with the launch of a comeback tour , talked about how songs he had written decades ago had taken on new meanings he never imagined ' these things assault you without warning , ' the @entity6 singer said			1
' you could be talking to someone , you could be walking down the road , and i have got to be very careful because this is still very raw ' close : @entity1 and his daughter @entity9 in 2009 ( left ) and with @entity9 and her sister @entity144 in 1996 ' i think somebody said she was the brightest of diamonds and i called the song @entity124			1
' if i really think about those words it 's too bizarre , it 's too telling , about whether it 's about @entity115 or - now - what it 's about @entity9			1
' ' the default position for me as a person is right , things have to be organised , and that distracts me , ' the singer continued			2
' but like anybody else these things assault you without warning			1
you could be talking to someone , you could be walking down the road , and i have got to be very careful because this is still very raw			0
' like anybody else these things assault you without warning			1
you could be talking to someone , you could be walking down the road , and i have got to be very careful because this is still very raw ' - @entity1 ' i 'm walking down the road and suddenly @entity171 there 's an awareness of her and i buckle , and i 've got to be very careful because walking down the @entity176 there 's paps everywhere so i have to duck into a lane and blub for a while			1
' i do n't want this to be a blub fest but you can imagine it			0
' however , the @entity186 singer said he had been humbled by the public 's support			0
' we were overwhelmed by people writing to us in the kindest way , ' he said			0
' complete strangers but who felt it and the nice thing about that was this young girl had made such an impact , especially on her generation			0
' i was talking in @entity200 and some people came up to me and said " you 're @entity9 's dad , are n't you ? "			2
but i liked it , i liked being @entity9 's dad			2
' of his proposal to his long - term girlfriend @entity206 just a month after his daughter 's death , he said : ' i was going to do it anyway on her birthday - i love her to bits and she 's amazing and i certainly would n't have got through the last 20 years without her			2
' he thought of postponing the proposal , he said , but : ' then i thought no , we need to let some air into the room , we need to let some light in			0
' tragic : peaches , pictured with her children and husband @entity220 , worried she would echo her mother 's fate performing with @entity6 , he played at he @entity226 in @entity227 , @entity228 , almost two months after she died			1
miss @entity9 was close to her father and after her death , he was the first family member to make a statement about their loss , expressing his devastation and disbelief			1
we are beyond pain , ' @entity1 wrote			2
' she was the wildest , funniest , cleverest , wittiest and the most bonkers of all of us			0
‘ writing “ was ” destroys me afresh			0
how is this possible that we will not see her again ? how is that bearable ? ’ smiling through it all : despite the grim subject of the interview , the presenter remarked on how well the singer looked , cracking a handful of jokes in the studio as he looked forward to going back on tour miss @entity9 was found unconscious at her home in @entity79 , @entity80 , on april 7 after taking heroin			1
an inquest hearing was told the drug was a likely cause of her death			0
in what is thought to have been her last interview before her death , she spoke of her fears that she would die like her mother @entity115 , who died of a heroin overdose in 2000			1
she told the @entity262 writer @entity261 : ‘ it ’s like i ’m someone in a book			0
your life , they keep telling you , is preordained , “ i ’m going to die like my mother ... she ’s going to end up like her mother ”			0
