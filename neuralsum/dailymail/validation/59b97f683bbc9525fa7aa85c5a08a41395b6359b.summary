@entity7 's cat babies did not come home after being let out at night
the animal was picked up by a *stranger* and taken to a local pet store
there vets considered it a stray as it was not wearing a microchip or collar
babies had been suffering renal failure and was given the lethal injection
mrs @entity7 and her two daughters discovered he was dead the next day
