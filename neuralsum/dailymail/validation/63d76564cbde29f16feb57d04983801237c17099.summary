a ' nearly pristine ' 600 million - year - old sponge has been uncovered in southern @entity1			1
scientists believe the sponge – which represents the most primitive animal on @entity5 - is the oldest ever found			2
its discovery pushes back the start of the evolution of multicellular animals to before the cambrian explosion 541 million years ago			1
a ' nearly pristine ' 600 million - year - old sponge has been uncovered in southern @entity13 believe the sponge – which represents the most primitive creature on @entity5 - is the oldest ever found the @entity16 , around 541 million years ago , was a wide variety of animals burst onto the evolutionary scene			1
before about 580 million years ago , most organisms were simple , composed of individual cells occasionally organised into colonies			1
over the following 70 or 80 million years , the rate of evolution accelerated and the diversity of life began to resemble that of today			2
it ended with the cambrian - ordovician extinction event , approximately 488 million years ago			1
the latest discovery pushes back the date of multicellular animal evolution to 60 million years before the @entity33 explosion started			1
sponges , also known as @entity35 , are multicellular organisms that have bodies covered with pores and channels that allow water to circulate through them			0
scientists have still to confirm when they first appeared on @entity5			0
estimates range from 700 million years ago to a time known as the @entity33 period , which took place 541 million to 485 million years ago			1
the latest finding would place the sponge around 60 million years before the @entity33 started			1
researchers want to pin down the date because they believe it is key to understanding early animal evolution			0
the split between sponges and most other animals was a major event in the early history of life on our planet			0
the sponge , found in the @entity62 , is just over one millimetre in height and width , according to researchers from the @entity66			2
to get a good look , scientists used scanning electron microscopy and x-ray technology			0
the team has named it @entity73 and say that it is made up of hundreds of thousands of cells			0
its structure is formed in three tube - like chambers that are fixed to a common base , with cell structures that resemble those in modern sponges			0
scientists also found surface cells that indicate pores , like modern sponges , which control water flowing into the organism			0
the sponge , found in the @entity62 in southern @entity1 ( left ) , suggests the date of multicellular animal evolution was 60 million years before the @entity33 explosion started			1
scientists found surface cells that indicate pores , like modern sponges ( right ) , which control water flowing into the organism there was an area inside one of the tubes with pits surrounded by raised collars - a possible precursor to choanocyte cells which modern sponges use to move water through their bodies			0
as well as being one of the oldest of the really old sponge fossils found , the find also represents one of the most pristine			2
the researchers say they have more material from the site where the sponge was found , and will be sifting through it looking for more tiny sponges and perhaps other organisms			2
lead author @entity117 told @entity118 that the find suggests that animals on @entity5 began diversifying 600 million years ago			1
' discovery of additional specimens would confirm that the fossil represents a @entity125 sponge , ' he said			0
' but features of the fossil are consistent with sponge anatomy … fossils of similarly advanced eumetazoans [ all major animal groups except sponges ] may yet lie in the fossil record			0
' the researchers say they have more material from the site where the sponge was found , and will be sifting through it looking for more tiny sponges and perhaps other organisms			2

the sponge was found in the @entity62 in southern @entity1
it suggests *multi-cellular* evolution took place before @entity33 explosion
the @entity33 explosion is believed to have begun 541 million years ago
the explosion refers to a time when complex creatures *rapidly* appeared
