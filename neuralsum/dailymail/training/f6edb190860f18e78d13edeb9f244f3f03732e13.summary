by @entity1 - @entity0 follow @ @ riathalsam for a split - second , @entity2 , the tradesman ’s son and great hope of @entity6 tennis , was out of @entity8 to a double fault			1
then @entity10 was clapped into life and from the tightest of margins came a second chance for a wildcard teenager who survived nine match points to spring one of the biggest shocks of these championships			0
on the other side of the net , @entity20 , the 13th seed , was shaking his head in disbelief			2
he knows a thing or two about teenage hype but — much like this match , in which he took a two - set lead and then lost 3 - 6 , 6 - 7 , 6 - 4 , 7 - 5 , 10 - 8 — his has been a story of talent not quite fulfilled			1
@entity20 suffered a shock as he lost to @entity2 in round two @entity2 celebrates a famous victory over @entity20 it ’s anyone ’s guess how far a prodigy can go in tennis , but already @entity2 is racking up the endorsements			1
his first came from @entity41 earlier this month , when he labelled the 19 - year - old ‘ the next big @entity6 star ’			1
and @entity20 weighed in on thursday night , saying : ‘ he can be a top - five player and he can win a @entity43			1
’ the signs so far are more than encouraging for a player who remains outside the top 100 at 144 , but who has made astonishing progress since he decided five years ago to shelve thoughts of a career in basketball in favour of a sport he disliked when first introduced to it			2
‘ my mum brought me down to the local tennis centre in @entity57 when i was seven and i was n’t keen , ’ he explained			0
‘ i did n’t want to play it			0
but i guess it was n’t a bad choice			0
’ @entity20 congratulates @entity2 after he beat him on thursday he has since acquired the junior title at the @entity62 , the junior doubles title here and yesterday took his first serious scalp from the elite			1
he did it with the fuel of a singing and dancing contingent of @entity6 , a backing he encouraged with fist pumps and screams			2
when @entity2 saved the first of those nine match points in the fourth set , he beat his chest and pointed at the noisy 10 or so fans in green and gold shirts			2
when he successfully challenged the fifth - set call made against his second serve at 6 - 5 @entity20 , advantage @entity20 , those @entity6 in the crowd responded with a rendition of the theme tune to the @entity87 films			1
day to remember : @entity2 plays a return to @entity20 during the clash he was spared by millimetres in that instance , and then survived a further three match points in a wonderful finale			1
‘ we all know his potential , ’ said @entity20			0
in the ambitious mind of @entity2 , the plan is for that potential to take him to world no 1 , as he was in the juniors			0
‘ my goal is to become the best , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s a long journey			0
this was my biggest career win			0
’ and a win which he followed immediately with a trip to the gym and thoughts of the 20 - year - old @entity109 , whom he faces in the next round after his fellow wildcard knocked out @entity112 , the 24th seed			2
the winner is likely to face @entity116 for a fairytale opportunity in the fourth @entity118 , @entity114 emerged intact from a fourth straight day of play as he survived a major scare against @entity121			0
longest match : it took @entity2 233 minutes to defeat the @entity124 much like his first - round match against @entity128 , the 14th seed ’s clash went to five sets and was split across two days			2
he resumed his second - round tie at two sets apiece and 9 - 9 with @entity121 serving , but the @entity124 battled through to win 4 - 6 , 7 - 6 , 6 - 7 , 6 - 3 , 14 - 12			1
@entity132 , a @entity133 with a huge serve , is also through after blitzing @entity134 in straight sets			0
@entity132 , who has offered only one , unconverted break point in two matches , beat the @entity136 6 - 3 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 4 .			1

thirteenth seed lost 3 - 6 6 - 7 ( 4 - 7 ) 6 - 4 7 - 5 10 - 8 to teenager
@entity20 says @entity2 can be a ' top five player and win a @entity43 '
