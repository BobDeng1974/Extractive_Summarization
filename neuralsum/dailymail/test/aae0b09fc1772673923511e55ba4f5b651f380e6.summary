most people , when scooping a massive win on the pools or national lottery , might follow the advice of a grey - suited financial adviser and buy a good - sized house , a reasonably flash car , take a couple of nice holidays and then live off the income from what ’s left			2
but the story of @entity13 — who died on saturday aged 79 — is an exuberant lesson in what happens when you ignore all the advice and just blow the lot			1
when @entity13 , a cake - factory worker from @entity25 in @entity26 , and her coal miner husband @entity27 won £ 152,319 , 18 shillings and 8d on the @entity22 in 1961 — the equivalent of around £ 3 million today — she announced that her life from now on would emphatically be neither sensible nor boring			1
‘ just imagine , ’ grinned @entity13			1
‘ i am going to buy masses of dresses and suits and coats			2
@entity48 wo n’t stand an earthly once i get cracking			2
there ’ll be new clothes , too , and presents — dozens of them — for our three children			2
’ and then — in a phrase that decades later became the title of a hit musical starring @entity58 — she famously announced that she was going to ‘ spend , spend , spend ’			1
unbeknown to the media , @entity13 was so poor that she could n’t even afford a pair of tights for the press conference , and had to borrow her sister ’s			1
she was earning just £ 7 a week at the factory , and her husband the same amount in night shifts			1
when the couple got the train to @entity40 to collect their cheque , she was astonished to see so many people at @entity73 rushing towards her compartment			2
‘ i thought : “ oh , i did n’t realise there were so many people who wanted to catch a train , ” ’ she said later			2
‘ that is how naive i was			2
’ the story of @entity13 — who died on saturday aged 79 — is an exuberant lesson in what happens when you ignore all the advice and just blow the lot after the cheque presentation ceremony at the @entity39 , she collapsed into the arms of the man who had handed the couple their massive winnings — @entity34			1
the following morning her ecstatic face and the headline ‘ @entity93 ’ were plastered over nearly every newspaper in the land			2
soon after breakfast , @entity13 was good to her word — she went out and started on her mission			1
for her new wardrobe , there was only one place to go — across @entity104 to @entity105			2
and of course , in the style of every pools and lottery winner , @entity13 bought the car of her dreams			1
in her case , the motor was as ostentatious as her bumptious personality — a @entity114			2
and she dyed her hair to match			0
the couple quickly moved out of their semi-detached council house on @entity119 , and into an £ 11,000 upmarket sprawling ranch - style bungalow complete with swimming pool in the well - to - do @entity125 suburb of @entity126			2
‘ the neighbours hated us and our noise , ’ she admitted			0
‘ mind you , we did party , party , party			0
’ the children were sent to private schools — the one sensible thing she did was to set up a trust to pay for their education — and @entity27 even bought a racehorse			0
it was a display of feckless extravagance at odds with an early @entity143 yet to escape the shadow of @entity146 austerity			0
for a short while , all seemed well , and the family travelled through the @entity150 and @entity151 , when such globetrotting seemed impossibly exotic			0
but without anyone to guide them — the counselling on offer to today ’s lottery winners was nowhere to be seen — the young couple were overwhelmed by the wealth those eight score - draws had brought them			0
their new home , which they called @entity166 after the ranch in tv western bonanza , was the scene of riotous parties and its built - in cocktail bar was an unheard of luxury for the mid-sixties			0
the couple ’s propensity for bubbly was such that @entity13 was known to wash in it			1
when they were n’t partying at home , they were knocking it back at the local pub , the @entity184			0
@entity13 also claimed they had to buy a new luxury car every six months , as she pranged them so often			1
‘ i used them to learn to drive			0
i was awful at reversing and would always reverse into somebody ’s plant pot or door			0
’ their spending was frittered away not just on motors , but on clothes and a lifestyle to match			0
their new - found fame bought access to the celebrities of their day , and the couple rubbed shoulders with the likes of @entity205 , @entity206 and even @entity207			0
and they had to look the part			0
@entity13 pictured outside the @entity211 production of ' @entity93 ' in 2000 for some , @entity13 ’s behaviour encapsulated the nascent consumer culture that was heralded by @entity215 ’s famous words from a few years before that the @entity217 people had ‘ never had it so good ’			1
although @entity13 was undeniably susceptible to such commercial pressures , there were other problems			1
‘ when we first won the money all we did was drink , ’ she admitted			2
‘ i used to fall over , i was falling from one table of drinks to the next for the first month or two			0
’ as well as struggling to cope with their excessive penchant for alcohol , both @entity27 and @entity13 struggled to adjust to a strange new social life			1
old friends and neighbours were jealous of their wealth and resentful of their hedonistic lifestyle			0
it did n’t help that @entity13 had a temper , and she and @entity27 often fought			1
‘ @entity27 hated it , ’ she later confessed			0
‘ i used to throw things at him when i lost my rag			0
’ but such incidents would soon seem trivial			0
in january 1965 , @entity27 was killed after losing control of his powder - blue @entity241 on the @entity242 , and skidding down an embankment			0
@entity27 ’s uncle , @entity244 , also died			0
that crash not only robbed @entity13 of a husband , but it also took away what remained of their wealth			1
@entity58 ( left ) , star of the musical spend spend spend and @entity13 , upon whose life story the musical was based by then , the couple had blown half of their winnings , and in the wake of his death , @entity259 ’s @entity258 with its punitive tax system helped itself in death duties to the remaining half			1
‘ even his watch , ’ @entity13 would bitterly recall			1
within little more than four years , @entity13 had gone from rags to riches to rags again			1
what she did have left were her looks and a certain celebrity , so she soon found herself singing @entity271 — what else ? — in a strip club in @entity274			0
however , the managers wanted more from @entity13 than just her voice , and insisted she should strip at the end of the song			1
@entity13 agreed , but only if she could keep her underwear on			1
her request was refused , but @entity13 was defiant			1
‘ i kept my knickers and bra on , ’ she recalled			0
‘ i was frogmarched into the back and told : “ you ’ll do it properly tomorrow or you ’re sacked			0
” ’ @entity13 still refused to strip , and the following night was indeed sacked			1
‘ i earned £ 50 , which did n’t even cover the petrol there and back , ’ she said , ‘ i could n’t do it ; i was n’t a stripper			2
’ @entity13 also spent time with lawyers to claw back some of the fortune taken by the taxman			1
she recovered a few thousand , quickly spent in the way that @entity13 knew best — on booze and the high life			1
to find some security , @entity13 remarried , and did so in her unique style three times in quick succession			1
she moved to @entity302 to start a new life , but a punch - up with a policeman put paid to that , and she was deported			2
without a bean and back in @entity25 , @entity13 tried to commit suicide , and was admitted to a mental institution			1
but soon she picked herself up , as she always had			0
in 1977 , she published her autobiography called — naturally — @entity93			0
this was turned into a @entity313 play , in which @entity13 was memorably portrayed by actress @entity314			1
in 2011 , she suffered a stroke , after which she was afflicted by dementia			0
but , despite it all , @entity13 never rued a single day in 1984 , @entity319 , lead singer of @entity320 , selected a vintage photo of @entity13 to grace the sleeve of the band ’s latest single , @entity318			1
and in 1999 , that @entity211 musical took off , earning @entity13 a hefty £ 100,000 in royalties			1
one might have thought that by then @entity13 would have learned her lesson			1
but no , she spent it , mostly on drink , which nearly killed her			0
after a spell in hospital , she recovered , and found stability in becoming a @entity335 and working in a perfume shop in @entity337			0
in 2011 , she suffered a stroke , after which she was afflicted by dementia			0
but , despite it all , @entity13 never rued a single day			1
‘ would i do it all again — you bet i flaming would , ’ she said			0
‘ i bought designer clothes , i travelled , i gave my kids a good education and i had a ball			0
i ’ve packed more into my life than 20 people			2
’ of course , it is easy for us to judge how @entity13 spent her life			1
for while her story is a parable on the perils of avarice , and how money really does n’t buy happiness , it is also a lesson in the corrupting influence of celebrity			0
famous and feted as she was , her money brought more entertainment for the rest of us than it did for her			0
even so , is n’t there a part of us all that wants to do as she did — to throw off the shackles of responsibility and convention , and spend , spend , spend ?			2

@entity13 won £ 152,319 , 18 shillings and 8d on the @entity22 in 1961
afterwards announced her life would no longer be sensible or boring
said she would ' spend , spend spend ' in phrase that prase that became the title of a hit musical
