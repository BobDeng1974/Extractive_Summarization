by @entity0 @entity1 is using someone else ’s recipe for methamphetamine			0
‘ @entity9 , ’ the show about a high school chemistry teacher who cooks meth to support his family after learning he has cancer , owes @entity7 chemistry professor @entity6 ’s formula to its success			1
as the show ’s science advisor , ms @entity6 keeps a stern eye over the show ’s drug and bomb @entity22 jumped at the opportunity to join the show because she saw it as a platform for putting accurate , interesting science in front of a young audience , she told @entity28			1
recipe for success : @entity6 , chemistry professor at the @entity7 , is the show 's science adviser ‘ we scientists knew this was a problem because enrollment ( in science classes ) had been dropping and so i thought this is a wonderful opportunity , ’ she told the station			1
she also cleared the air regarding how much drugs she has cooked , for posterity ’s sake , of course			0
‘ i have to say i have never made methamphetamine , ’ said @entity44			0
the professor first contacted show creator @entity46 after reading a profile of him in @entity48 , she told vulture			2
calling it an opportunity to build a bridge , she told the site she ‘ knew how much the chemistry community wanted to see correct science in movies and television , and that they also wanted to see scientists presented appropriately			0
’ mr @entity46 immediately took her up on the offer			0
in addition to seeing that mr @entity1 cooks great meth , ms @entity6 also makes sure the protagonist walks the walk and talks the talk			1
mr @entity1 needs to also talk like a phd , he does because of @entity70 lectures in class , his rants to partner @entity73 and his chats with his son , they ’re authentic because ms @entity6 supervises their scripting , she told the station			1
not his recipe : @entity1 ( left ) and @entity73 ( right ) use ms @entity6 's expertise when it comes to their organic chemistry noting a lecture mr @entity1 gave to a class , ms @entity6 said she had to rewrite the entire thing			2
the memo she sent them was then made the script , they even used her diagrams			0
as for mr @entity1 ’s meth ? the process is real , she told vulture , but with one caveat			2
‘ it ’s a valid synthesis , the way they ’re using methylamine , ’ she said , adding that the @entity95 actually has a hand in overseeing the cooking			1
‘ what they are doing is leaving out steps			0
or sometimes they show some steps from one synthesis and subsequent steps from another synthesis , which prevents @entity9 from becoming an illegal meth cookbook , ’ she added			1
too blue : ms @entity6 says the meth is too blue to be real , but that artistic license took over so mr @entity1 could have a trademark she has had to allow for a bit of creative license when it comes to the show ’s main product , blue meth			1
ms @entity6 initially told producer @entity46 that the ‘ blue was a little too blue , ’ but he ‘ wanted @entity120 to have a trademark , ’ she said to @entity93			2
‘ so , it ’s a little exaggerated			0
it ’s not supposed to be 100 per cent factual			0

@entity7 chemistry professor @entity6 is an adviser to the hit show
she helps write his lectures and chemistry *-* *related* *interactions* with others
she says the meth being cooked uses real methylamine
the meth cooking process is actually overseen by the @entity95 , to make sure it does *n't* become ' an illegal meth cookbook '
