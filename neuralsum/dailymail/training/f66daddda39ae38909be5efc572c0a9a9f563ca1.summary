the front row may have been the worst place to be at @entity4 ' @entity3 menswear show today			1
the designer - who 's been dubbed # d * * * owens by @entity9 wags - sent men down the catwalk out in loose hanging , draped smocks with one very particular detail - groin peepholes , treating fashion fans to the sight of model manhood in all its glory - as part of his autumn / winter 2015 show			1
while for some of the gentlemen the outfits sat so low their modesty was protected , others were n't so lucky and one chap wore a top which , due to the unfortunate crotch - level cropping , gave the world an x-rated eyeful			1
one user said : ' i bet more than height and waist measurements were taken at the @entity4 casting			2
' another quipped : ' immediate reaction to the @entity4 crotch cutouts : that male model 's mom is going to be placing a very stern phone call			1
' fashion editors were quick to review the show with @entity63 saying : ' just as 2014 was the year of the butt , 2015 is shaping up to be about the bulge in fashion land			2
' however they said many of the attendees missed the big moment because they were too busy on their phones : ' the penises were n't the point of the show - it was blink - and - you - miss - it - but many editors were cursing themselves afterward for missing them because they were too busy texting			0
' for some of the models the outfits were long enough that they covered their modesty - others were n't so lucky some of the attendees at the show said that you could blink and miss the full frontal male nudity that took place at the show and fashion blogger @entity91 did n't seem to think the outfits were that big of a deal			2
she told @entity94 : ' i liked that you hardly noticed it			0
it was n't nudity for the sake of nudity			0
i honestly did n't see until somebody pointed out the d * * * flaps and the undie holes			1
' many people took to @entity104 to repost the pictures which quickly went viral , sharing them under the hashtag # d * * kowens , a play on the @entity112 - born designer 's name			1
many @entity9 users took to the social media site to express their amusement at the @entity4 show in @entity3 today according to fashion insiders at the show there were a total of three penises in the show although to what degree they were seen varied depending on the model			1
@entity4 's show and his penis peephole outfits are the latest in a long line of bizarre offerings which have taken place during the men 's fashion weeks			2
in @entity132 models walked down the catwalk with lego stuck to their faces			0
while not all of the models showed off their whole bodies it seems that wearing underwear will be a definite no - no this autumn and at the house of @entity142 they were photographed coming down the runway with plastic bags on their heads and others had the same emblazoned on their jumpers			0
at the @entity151 show and @entity152 in @entity153 it was all about giant winter warmers			0
while @entity151 controversially showed giant fur hats and huge lined coats , @entity152 had models walk down the runway in giant scarfs			0
at the @entity161 show men were dressed in very feminine outfits including lace tops , pussybow blouses and vests .			0
