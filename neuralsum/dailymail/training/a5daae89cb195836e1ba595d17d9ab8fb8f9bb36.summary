my colleague @entity0 was right			0
@entity3 ’s push on @entity4 when @entity5 played @entity6 was cowardly and dangerous , and should have been dealt with more harshly			1
rugby union has very simple rules governing the protection of a player in the air			1
he can not be hit and , if he is , anything from a spell in the sin bin to a full - blown dismissal can result , depending on the severity of the event			0
the shove by @entity5 's @entity3 that sent @entity6 's @entity4 flying in the hoardings the @entity22 defender was left crumpled in agony as his shoulder was dislocated by the impact the @entity5 player checks on @entity4 after the incident during last weekend 's match at the @entity29 @entity4 receives treatment from an @entity6 physio as it becomes apparent he is unable to continue @entity3 pushed @entity4 when he was unable to control his momentum or fall and he is now out for three months after colliding with perimeter advertising			1
a three - match ban would still be a let - off , by comparison			0
nothing , which is what @entity3 received from referee @entity38 , means the practice will only be encouraged			1
i am surprised that more was not made of @entity3 ’s cowardly push on @entity4			1
the @entity5 man shoved @entity4 while he was in mid-air and now @entity6 ’s right back is out for three months with a dislocated shoulder after he crashed into an advertising hoarding			1
on tuesday when @entity51 ’s @entity50 shoved @entity52 , the @entity49 defender was lucky to escape injury			2
@entity49 defender @entity52 lies hurt after being shoved by @entity51 's @entity50 @entity4 is carried off on a stretcher and will be out for three months with a dislocated shoulder it is a cheap shot , it shows no respect for your opponent or their safety and as a former pro it really riles me			1
i fractured my shoulder playing against @entity66 when somebody shoved me when i was already falling			2
it leaves you no time to brace yourself			0
@entity70 was shoved into @entity71 while playing for @entity72 against @entity73			2
he broke his jaw and missed @entity75			0
it can look innocuous , but it ’s a deliberate act and must stop			0
if you hit the hoarding , it ’s like being shoved into a brick wall			0
@entity81 pushed @entity70 into goalkeeper @entity71 in 2012 , causing him to break his jaw			0

@entity3 shoved @entity4 into advertising *boards*
@entity6 defender dislocated his shoulder and faces three months out
but @entity5 player 's ' cowardly and dangerous ' push went *unpunished*
referee @entity38 has set a poor *precedent* by not *issuing* red card
in rugby , rules are in place to protect players in the air
