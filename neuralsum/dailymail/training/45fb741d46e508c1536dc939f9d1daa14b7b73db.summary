torment : @entity1 says she will spend the money from her @entity5 win on surgery an acid attack victim who won the jackpot on @entity10 's biggest quiz show is refusing to give up on justice - despite her attackers remaining free			1
@entity1 was 17 years old when a spurned suitor and his friends broke into her home and doused her body in @entity18 , a chemical normally used to clean rusted tools , while she slept			1
she was left partially blind and deaf with 70 per cent burns on her body and has received no state funding for her treatment			1
last year , she wrote to the @entity10 government threatening to kill herself if she did not receive state aid			1

now 28 , miss @entity1 , says only justice will give her closure and , spurred on by her new - found fame and fortune , is determined to spearhead a major change in women 's rights in @entity10			1
she said : ' i used to be a beautiful , confident woman			2
but my beauty became my curse			2
' for three years after the attack , i was in shock and unable to do anything			2
i even applied for euthanasia but when that was refused i decided to fight back			2
' people like these three men , who can spoil someone 's life like this in a fraction of a second should be brought to justice			1
' these incidents [ of acid attacks ] will stop only when people involved are given hard punishments according to the crime they have committed			1
' i have seen them once in the court but my father who follows my case is taunted by them saying to us , " nothing will come out of this court case			0
" ' but i will never give up until they are brought to justice			0
that is what i want to do			0
' @entity10 is said to be the fourth most dangerous country for females to live , according to a @entity85 study			1
acid sales are not regulated , with the corrosive product widely available for purchase for less than rs. 20 ( 24p )			1
following the attack , miss @entity1 struggled to cope , her mother fell into depression and the family left their hometown of @entity95 for the capital @entity97			1
there she underwent surgery 22 times , with the series of operations and consultations she has already endured costing hundreds of thousands of rupees			0
her family sold ancestral land and her mother 's jewellery to pay for the treatment and had run out of money for further procedures before her win			1
miss @entity1 pictured on @entity5 ? last year with former miss universe @entity112 and host @entity114 , known as @entity114 in @entity10 she says that it will cost an estimated 1.5million rupees for her to look ' even remotely human ' and to have her eyesight restored			1
earlier this year some rs 30 lakh was raised by @entity118 - based company @entity117 as part of @entity120 and celebrities such as @entity123 actress @entity122 and producer @entity124 also donated funds to the appeal			2
miss @entity1 won a million rupees - almost £ 30,000 - on @entity5 , the @entity10 edition of @entity5 ? the show shot to worldwide fame when it was featured at the centre of @entity133 's @entity132 - winning @entity131			1
her appearance , alongside @entity123 actress and former miss universe @entity112 , was on a special edition featuring contestants who overcame adversity			0
the show 's host @entity114 , known as @entity114 in @entity10 , said : ' denied justice , she pleaded publicly to end her life			1
denied that too because euthanasia is illegal in the country , she decided not to remain silent and suffer			0
' her story is one of immense courage			0
' the nation salutes her as do all of us , but simultaneously hangs its head in shame for this dastardly act			0
' her jackpot win of rs 25 laks - equivalent to almost £ 30,000 - came as part of a one - off edition of @entity156 called @entity157 , or @entity158 , which featured contestants who have shown courage in the face of adversity			2
now , miss @entity1 is appealing for ' stringent punishment ' for her attackers			1
she said : ' such incidents should stop and they will stop only when people involved in such cases are given hard punishments			0
' they need to be punished according to the crime that they 've done			0
' people like these who can spoil anyone 's life like this in a fraction of a second should be brought to justice			2
they too should get the same treatment			0
' i am lucky that i survived and wish the same does not happen to any other girl			0
' according to the doctors my condition was so dire i should n't have survived			0
' but now it is time to change the 50 - year - old law so that such cases do not ever occur in the future			2
' with her winnings @entity1 hopes to return her family 's life back to normal			1
she said : ' firstly i will get my treatment done , but my family is in a very dire state			0
' they have sold off everything for my treatment and neither do we have a job to earn anything			0
' my mother has been in a very bad mental state since my attack , my grandfather suffered a heart attack and we do not have a house of our own			0
' so my main motive with the money is to get my treatment done so that i can at least start a normal life , and take my family and myself out of this trauma			0
they have sacrificed and faced a lot for me			0
