the internet has allowed us to take a closer look at each others ' lives in a way that has never before been possible			0
and now a new website has taken that ethos to an extreme , by providing a live feed of every single picture uploaded to photo - sharing service @entity11 from five major cities			1
the effect could be chillingly invasive - but instead , the stream of colourful images combine into a beautiful art project			0
a snapshot of @entity19 : the site takes images uploaded from the capital and shows them as a giant photo mosaic the site , called this is now , hosts @entity11 feeds from @entity26 , @entity19 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29			1
each of the five versions shows a non-stop stream of the pictures taken by users of the app in the relevant city			2
they use the geographical identification feature of @entity11 to narrow down the appropriate pictures , only showing you picture from your chosen city			1
the result is a unique window into the lives of some of the world 's most vibrant cities , described as a constantly changing portrait of how residents see their world			0
@entity19 : this image shows what residents of the @entity53 's capital were taking pictures of early on friday morning by thursday night , 50,000 people had visited the site as it went viral			2
however , notwithstanding the aesthetic appeal of the site , which was created by @entity62 company @entity61 , some will surely have privacy concerns			1
though the site is only taking information previously submitted publicly to @entity11 , some users may not realise their photographs are so easily visible to the whole world			2
@entity11 fans may think they are only sharing pictures with their friends , but by using the app they are entrusting their personal information to a corporate giant - and publishing it to the web			1
@entity27 : @entity62 share an interest in fashion and the @entity78 , according to the @entity11 feed from this is now the site also gives a fascinating insight int the activities of each cities residents - for instance , @entity19 's stream is filled to the brim with @entity78 pictures at the moment , while @entity89 residents seem to prefer self portraits			1
the @entity27 firm behind the site described it as ' a visual composition which uses real - time updates from the ever popular @entity11 application based on users geo - tag locations '			2
' the tool streams photos instantly as soon as they are uploaded on @entity11 and captures a cities movement , in a fluid story , ' the firm said			1
it also promised that more cities are coming to the service soon			0
@entity28 : it must be lunchtime in @entity89 , as smartphone users eagerly upload photographs of tasty - looking meals @entity11 hit the headlines earlier this year when it was sold to @entity111 for an astonishing $ 1 billion - although it has now emerged that @entity11 co-founder @entity112 initially wanted $ 2billion for his start up			1
according to an article in @entity115 , the major acquisition was handled in a markedly start - up way , with mr @entity117 calling mr @entity112 on april 5 and asking for a meeting			0
the two proceeded to spend 12 - hour days ironing out the financial details not in a formal conference room of a corporate headquarters but in the comfort of mr @entity117 ’s $ 7million , five bedroom home in @entity125			0
the move was a risky one : @entity11 has generated zero profit in its two years of existence , but the 27 - year - old billionaire saw it as filled with potential because of the rate at which it has grown			2
mr @entity117 raised the question of whether @entity111 would eventually become a company like @entity134 - which is valued at $ 200billion - or would it stick closer to the projections that place @entity111 ’s initial public offering valuation at $ 100billion			1
at the end of the three day negotiations , mr @entity112 agreed to a deal that amounts to roughly $ 1billion in @entity111 stock			1
by day three , when they were about to sign off on the final details , the two men alerted their respective boards and investors			0
the troops rounded up quickly , and in the case of @entity111 they held a vote			0
@entity29 : the beautiful people of @entity150 happily share pictures of themselves - and their pets - while they are using @entity11 despite of the seemingly democratic method , the vote was largely symbolic because mr @entity117 has enough clout to make it go through with his voting shares even if he did not have their support			2
mr @entity117 was clearly happy with his investment and , appropriately , he decided to share his satisfaction			0
‘ this is an important milestone for @entity111 because it 's the first time we 've ever acquired a product and company with so many users , ’ he wrote on his @entity111 wall , referencing @entity11 ’s approximate 35 million users			1
‘ we do n't plan on doing many more of these , if any at all			0
but providing the best photo sharing experience is one reason why so many people love @entity111 and we knew it would be worth bringing these two companies together			0
’ a day after posting about the deal on @entity111 , he took to @entity11 , displaying a photo of his @entity174			1
a snapshot of @entity26 on the @entity176 is now service , which takes instagram pictures of a city and displays them in real time to create a photo montage			0

site shows some of the estimated five million photos uploaded to @entity11 every day
*innovative* new use for the web site which @entity111 bought for $ *1bn*
privacy concerns have been raised over the site even though it uses pictures uploaded to the public @entity11 service
