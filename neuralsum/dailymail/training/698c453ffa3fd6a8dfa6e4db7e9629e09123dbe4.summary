by @entity0 published : 11:28 est , 5 april 2013 updated : 12:02 est , 5 april 2013 a woman who provided key testimony in a murder trial that sent a man to prison for life for killing a young mother and stabbing her son has now claimed that she lied in court			1
@entity10 has filed two affidavits in @entity12 , @entity13 admitting that much of what she said in the cases against @entity16 in 1996 and 2012 was untrue			1
in the first trial , @entity16 was convicted of stalking @entity18 and served 10 years			1
in the second , he was found guilty of killing her then - housemate in october 1995 after ' new evidence ' emerged			0
@entity18 sobbed during television interviews and gave emotional testimony in the trial last year , becoming shrill as she faced @entity16 , who represented himself in court			1
' that 's hard for me			0
' but now the affidavits say @entity16 never harassed or threatened to kill her , as she had claimed , and that she had spent time with him willingly ahead of his first conviction , @entity44 reported			2
' @entity16 never assaulted me or threatened me with a handgun , nor did he ever put a gun to my head on july 25 , 1995 , or july 26 , 1995 , or any other date or occasion , ' she wrote			2
she added that she lied after suffering from ' anxiety , depression , manic episodes ' and while she was taking painkillers , muscle relaxants and ' other substance ' last year			0
convicted : @entity16 , pictured at his case last year , was found guilty of stalking her and murdering her rommate victims : @entity65 was killed and her five - year - old son @entity66 was stabbed multiple times in 1995 but based on her testimony and new dna evidence , @entity16 was convicted of killing @entity18 's roommate @entity65 and attacking her five - year - old son , @entity66 , in 1995			1
prosecutors had claimed that @entity16 had killed @entity65 as revenge against @entity18 after she told police he had been harassing her			1
@entity16 had long been a suspect in the murder , but he was only charged after hairs found on @entity65 's body matched his dna in 2009			1
but in her affidavits , @entity18 also shot this down , claiming that a blanket found at the crime scene with his hairs on was one @entity18 had owned when she was spending time with @entity16			2
he had used the blanket at her old apartment and when she moved in with @entity65 , she gave the blanket to the woman , explaining why his dna might be on it , and her body			1
recovery : prosecutors said that @entity16 had attacked the @entity91 out of revenge for @entity18 reporting to police that he had stalked her			2
she now denies she was harrased or threatened enduring pain : @entity97 sobbed in court last year as he recounted the 1995 attack that killed his mother @entity16 was found guilty last year of murder , burglary and aggravated battery and stalking , and was sentenced to life plus 47.5 years behind bars			1
his lawyers told @entity31 that @entity18 wrote to @entity16 in prison to tell him that she was coming clean and now he is already demanding a new trial			2
' i do n't think he 's shocked , ' his attorney @entity111 told the @entity113			0
he ' knew [ her testimony ] was a lie when he heard it			0
he 's the least surprised of anybody			0
' but prosecutors are uncertain that the denials will be taken seriously			0
@entity120 assistant district attorney @entity120 , who prosecuted the case , told the @entity113 that he is unaware of any legal reason to believe the conviction will be overturned			0
demand : attorneys said @entity16 is seeking a new trial , but prosecutors said there will not necessarily be one he said @entity16 is not entitled to a new trial and that he still believes there is ' overwhelming ' evidence of guilt			1
' this case was not about ms. @entity133 , ' @entity120 told the @entity113			0
' she was but the backdrop to explain why the defendant would perpetrate the murder of @entity65 and the brutal assault on @entity97 , persons who would otherwise be strangers to him			2
' he added that she had admitted she has become unstable since the trial and had encouraged her to seek professional help			0

@entity10 gave emotional testimony in @entity16 's stalking case in 1996 and in his murder trial in 2012
he is serving life for the murder of @entity65 in 1995
but now @entity156 claims she was never harassed and has shot down *crucial* dna evidence that linked him to the murder
she claims she was suffering from depression when she testified
he wants a *re-trial* but prosecutors said there is other evidence of his guilt
