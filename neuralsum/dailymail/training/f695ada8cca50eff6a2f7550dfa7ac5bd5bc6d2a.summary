over 300,000 @entity0 have already been infected with the potentially fatal ' kissing bug disease ' called @entity2 but @entity0 healthcare workers lack of knowledge about the illness is letting many cases of the parasite unnoticed			1
some doctors are calling it the ' new aids ' because of the way it develops			1
researchers who gathered on tuesday at the annual @entity14 and hygiene meeting in @entity16 said that if caught early the disease can be cured however sometimes the disease can be asymptomatic and there is a dearth in medication for the condition			1
the @entity23 reports that the initial symptoms of the disease caused by a parasite , @entity26 , which is spread through the feces of kissing bugs includes fever , fatigue , body aches , rash , diarrhea and vomiting			2
one of the first visual signs can be a skin lesion or a purplish swelling of the lid of one eye			0
the disease can develop in the body causing eventual heart failure and other deadly complications that by the time they are realized can not be helped with medicine			0
' we were astonished to not only find such a high rate of individuals testing positive for @entity2 in their blood , but also high rates of heart disease that appear to be @entity65 - related , ' said @entity66 , an epidemiologist at the @entity67			1
the @entity23 has said that they believe most of the people infected with @entity2 got the parasite in @entity70 or @entity71 before coming to the @entity0 the @entity72 has not yet approved two medicines called nifurtimox and benznidazole that are currently used to treat			1
