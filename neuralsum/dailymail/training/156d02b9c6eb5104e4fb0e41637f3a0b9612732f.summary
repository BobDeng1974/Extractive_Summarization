@entity43 manager @entity41 said : ‘ @entity54 players have got to be thinking this is a great opportunity , not only to be part of a wonderful tournament but there at the end when the prizes are dished out			1
’ @entity62 's strong support for captain @entity63 , who faces an @entity65 charge for using racist and abusive language against @entity68 batsman @entity67 , is being interpreted as signalling the start of a battle between @entity71 and @entity62 ’s @entity72 for the @entity65 chairmanship			2
it was @entity71 who felt it inappropriate that @entity63 should receive the @entity78 trophy when serving an @entity65 ban , with further charges pending , much to @entity62 ’s upset			0
@entity72 has the backing of many counties , making it a strong possibility he will lead domestic cricket while @entity71 concentrates on the international game			0
@entity62 have backed their captain @entity63 after he abused @entity68 's @entity67 the @entity4 look likely to be dragged into a messy legal fight following @entity91 ’s removal from their @entity92 for speaking out over the governing body ’s lack of action on discrimination			2
