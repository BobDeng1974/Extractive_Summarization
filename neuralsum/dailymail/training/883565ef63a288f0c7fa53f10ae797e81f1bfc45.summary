’ the proposed turbine ( left ) will stand at a towering 150ft - taller than the village church			2
ex-bbc @entity29 correspondent @entity29 , who lives near mr @entity5 , has spoken out against the businessman 's plans mr @entity29 , who can already see one wind turbine from the bottom of his driveway in @entity14 ( pictured ) , accused mr @entity5 of seeking to make money rather than save the planet the firm that will supply mr @entity5 ’s turbine , @entity52 , said some owners could net as much as £ 100,000 a year from a single @entity55 turbine that fed power directly into the @entity57			1
