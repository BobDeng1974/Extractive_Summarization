let 's face it , as far as fans are concerned , what else do @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 have to play for ? the best of the rest ? a third and fourth place spot , which one of them , if not two , dare say it all three , could still miss out on ? admittedly , @entity3 are still in the @entity12 , but @entity13 has made it through the group stage , ticked another box on his managerial targets for the year and could well exit the competition at the same stage they have in the previous four campaigns			1
@entity13 lifts the @entity23 trophy aloft after @entity3 beat @entity24 at @entity25 last may @entity26 celebrates scoring the winner for the @entity28 against @entity30 's side @entity3 realise that retaining the @entity23 is their best chance of silverware this season @entity34 's 35th birthday happens to fall on @entity23 final day at the end of this season the @entity12 is like a speck in the distance for @entity3 , but lifting that @entity23 trophy in front of 90,000 fans at @entity25 is within touching distance of all three			1
yes , the @entity42 , the owners and chief executives and chairmen want @entity12 football to balance the books and keep the @entity48 demons at bay			0
but real fans want trophies and with @entity53 and @entity54 being dumped out of the tournament in true magic - of - the - cup fashion by @entity58 and @entity59 , the @entity23 is there for the taking			1
it 's at the tip of their fingers			0
when @entity4 travel to @entity67 on saturday , @entity3 host @entity59 on sunday and @entity5 visit @entity68 on monday , that will not be lost on their respective managers			1
@entity71 celebrates after scoring as @entity72 @entity58 dumped @entity53 out at @entity73 @entity5 have n't won the trophy for more than 10 years ( @entity75 has never clinched it ) the final , the showpiece event at the national stadium at the end of the league season on may 30 , falls , as no @entity4 fan will let us forget , on @entity34 's 35th birthday			1
manager @entity84 sees it as the perfect send - off for club and country 's greatest player of the past decade ( surely winning the league , the only club trophy to have eluded him , would be better ? )			0
@entity13 revealed after @entity3 's @entity23 final win against @entity24 last season that it was the sweetest trophy of his career , coming from two goals behind in the first eight minutes to win in extra time and shrug the mounting trophy drought from his heavily weighed - down shoulders			1
@entity5 have n't lifted it for more than a decade , their last victory coming in 2004 , allowing @entity3 to catch them as joint-most winners sharing 11			1
@entity105 has described the @entity23 as ' the most famous domestic cup in the world ' @entity75 , @entity108 and @entity109 have never won it			2
this season , @entity105 made it a priority , alongside the @entity113 title , and having managed in @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 described it as ' the most famous domestic cup in the world '			0
top - flight teams have taken the competition , it feels , more seriously from the early stages this season			2
when this trio entered at the third round , they all played strong sides			0
@entity84 started @entity34 and @entity126 against @entity127			0
@entity128 , @entity75 and @entity129 were all in from the off against @entity130			0
in @entity3 's repeat of last year 's final against @entity24 they went with @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136			2
can one of them get a grip on the trophy now and wrench it from their rivals ' claws ?			0

@entity3 , @entity5 and @entity4 the top clubs still left in
*remarkably* , @entity5 have n't won the @entity23 since 2004
@entity53 were *knocked* out by @entity58 in the fourth round
