by @entity0 published : 22:56 est , 19 august 2012 updated : 19:54 est , 20 august 2012 @entity1 backs the contentious plans @entity1 has given his backing to contentious plans to encourage the sale of expensive council houses			0
local authorities have been urged to rid themselves of homes in high - value postcodes by the prime minister ’s favourite think - tank , the @entity12			1
around £ 4.5billion a year could be raised if councils sold costly homes when tenants moved out			1
this could then be invested in extra housing stock in cheaper areas , the think - tank said			1
it could also be used to build new homes , stimulating the economy and generating jobs			2
critics say the idea would create ghettos – but @entity27 gave the idea its firm backing yesterday			1
the prime minister ’s official spokesman said : ‘ councils should be looking at ways to use their social housing stock as efficiently as they can			1
‘ the waiting lists for social housing have increased a lot in the past			2
' they doubled under the last government			0
[ @entity32 ] need to think about how they can use that social housing more efficiently			2
if they can sell very high - worth housing and invest in more social housing and find homes for more people , that ’s something that should be looked at			1
’ housing minister @entity49 has also praised the proposal , saying : ‘ where you have houses which are worth millions , you could sell them and build a lot more homes to help sometimes vulnerable people come off the waiting list			1
selling off : housing minister @entity49 says that it is ' blindingly obvious ' that council chiefs should sell off houses to generate money which could build more homes more jobs : selling expensive homes in areas like @entity65 , @entity66 , would mean more affordable housing could be built and that would create up to 340,000 jobs in the construction sector a refugee family moved into a @entity75 end - of - terrace home worth £ 1.25million in @entity74 after it was given a £ 76,000 facelift - and then trashed it			1
jobless @entity77 received thousands of pounds in housing benefit from @entity80 and @entity81 , but her seven wayward children refused to co-operate and have been accused of anti-social behaviour			2
after pressure from the council she has agreed to leave the borough and signed a court order promising her children would clean up their act			0
the agreement means the clan will be given a new taxpayer - funded property after the council acknowledged it had a ‘ legal obligation ’ to find them a new home			2
‘ it is blindingly obvious , and only a perverse kind of left - wing dogma that appears indifferent to those languishing on record waiting lists prevents this kind of common sense from prevailing			2
’ there has been outrage at revelations that taxpayers have been footing costly rent bills for social tenants , including £ 2,875 a week for an @entity110 family living in a seven - bedroom house in @entity112 , @entity113			1
the @entity12 ’s report , ending expensive @entity115 , said selling council homes in such areas would be enough to build 80,000 to 170,000 more properties			1
@entity119 , the think - tank ’s director , said social housing would still exist in very expensive areas under its proposal , but there would be ‘ less of it ’			1
under the new system , he told the @entity127 , ‘ rather than having one lucky family with a very expensive house you would have two families , perhaps desperately waiting for social housing , now having a roof over their heads ’			2
the waiting list for social housing could be reduced by about 500,000 to around 1.3million if the sales went ahead , he added			2
however , councillor @entity138 , chairman of the @entity140 ’s housing board , said : ‘ these are decisions that should be taken at a local level by councils who best know the value of their housing stock and the extent and type of housing needed in their area			1
’ mother of eight @entity154 was placed in a £ 2.6m house in @entity156 , west @entity66 at the taxpayers ' expense a single mother with three children was placed by her local council in a £ 1.5m mews house , left , in @entity163 , west @entity66 , four years ago			2
right , the seven - bedroom home in @entity112 , @entity113 , where an @entity110 family were placed at a cost of £ 2,875 a week to taxpayers @entity168 said new homes were urgently needed , but stressed that ‘ driving out hard - working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods ’ was not the answer			1
the @entity174 warned many towns would be ‘ cleansed ’ of ‘ hard - working people who ca n’t afford to pay high prices ’			0
around one in five of the country ’s 3.8million council houses are worth more than the average home , with some worth over £ 1million			0
selling the 816,000 ‘ costly ’ council houses would raise about £ 159billion			0
about 3.5 per cent of the total stock is vacated each year , as tenants move or die			1
if the government sold off this proportion of the costly homes – about 28,500 a year – it could raise £ 4.5billion			1
£ 2million : a townhouse owned by @entity190 in @entity66 this £ 2million @entity192 townhouse in @entity65 , @entity66 , is among the pricy properties that councils could be forced to sell off if the @entity12 ’s proposals are pushed through			0
the property underwent a £ 100,000 renovation last year , which created two more bedrooms for a total of six			0
it is currently occupied by a @entity202 family of ten , who use housing benefits from @entity190 to pay a heavily discounted rent bill			0
another candidate for sale is a £ 1million council house in private mews in @entity209 , which was recently boarded up after its tenants were evicted			0
@entity212 called for the four - bedroom property , which was empty for a year , to be sold and the profit used to help families who are desperate for a home			0
it is still owned by @entity218 , but is no longer vacant			0
for one council , the sell - off has already started			1
a vacant period mid-terrace house in @entity74 went for £ 721,000 last month , while a three - bedroom flat was sold for £ 700,000			0
a nearby property was sold for £ 705,000 in june			0
gone : @entity225 in @entity74 worth £ 705,000 sold : @entity225 in @entity74 worth £ 700,000 gone : @entity225 in @entity74 worth £ 721,000 dame @entity226 was at the heart of the @entity228 during @entity230 's reign and rose to great heights as the leader of @entity233			0
she played a key role in a 1980s scandal that saw council homes sold off to potential @entity228 voters in marginal wards in a bid to boost conservative election prospects			0
in july 1987 , @entity233 's housing committee voted to sell 500 council homes a year to designated tenants in a policy called ' building stable communities			1
' conservative council leader , @entity226 , was determined to improve her party 's standing at the 1990 local elections as the previous year , the @entity228 majority in the council had been reduced from 26 to four			0
between 1987 and 1989 dame @entity226 focused the housing policy on eight marginal wards in the borough			0
at a fraction of their market value , properties were only offered for sale to tenants likely to vote conservatives			0
in theory owner - occupiers were viewed as more likely to vote @entity228 and homes were left vacant to encourage their purchase			1
in turn homeless families were discouraged from moving into the ring - fenced properties and @entity168 tenants were moved out into less critical areas			1
after the scandal broke , an investigation was launched - the policy was judged illegal by the district auditor , and after years of wrangling @entity226 was made to repay @entity233 £ 12.3 million .			0
