@entity0 yesterday condemned a ‘ deeply confrontational ’ move by the @entity3 president to ask the @entity4 to recognise an independent state for his people			1
mr @entity0 , who is the international community ’s @entity7 representative , joined @entity10 leaders in opposing the application by @entity12			0
mr @entity12 is seeking full @entity4 membership for @entity14 , even though @entity16 troops still occupy its territory			1
opposition : @entity0 , who is the international community ’s @entity7 representative , joined @entity10 leaders in opposing the application for recognition by @entity3 president @entity12 ( left ) he handed his application letter to @entity4 secretary - general @entity23 and it must now be considered by the @entity24			1
in a 35 - minute speech in @entity26 , mr @entity12 said it was the ‘ moment of truth ’ for @entity14 to gain its long overdue independence			1
@entity29 has promised to use its @entity24 veto to block the move , however , and there are fears of renewed violence in the @entity7			0
@entity16 argues that a lasting settlement can be brought to the war - torn region only by face - to - face negotiations			1
that view is shared by mr @entity0 , who said @entity4 recognition would do nothing to advance @entity3 independence			1
‘ you can pass whatever resolution you like at the @entity4 or the @entity24 , it does n’t actually deliver you a state on the ground in the @entity49 and @entity50 , and if you do n’t have a negotiation , whatever you do at the @entity4 is going to be deeply confrontational , ’ the former @entity43 said yesterday			1
@entity16 prime minister @entity52 said his country was ' willing to make painful compromises ' but there was no such obvious opposition from @entity57 , who has yet to make clear whether he will oppose the move			1
earlier this week the prime minister said : ‘ we support @entity14 having its own state next to a secure @entity16			1
‘ in the end we have to recognise we will get a @entity3 state alongside an @entity16 state by the @entity3 and the @entity16 sitting down and talking to each other			1
’ on the @entity4 action , he added : ‘ we do n’t yet know what resolution is going to be put forward , what it is going to say , what its terms are			0
‘ there will only be one test for @entity74 policy , which is : will this help to bring about the establishment of a state for the @entity3 next to a secure state for @entity16 ? ’ even as mr @entity12 spoke yesterday , tensions were running high in the @entity49			1
as @entity16 troops and protesters exchanged rocks and rubber bullets in the @entity49 , mr @entity12 was greeted with rapturous applause as he addressed a sympathetic @entity4 general assembly in @entity26			1
‘ the time has come for the @entity3 spring , the time for independence , ’ he said			1
‘ the time has come for our men , women and children to have normal lives			0
for them to be able to sleep without fear of what the next day will bring			0
‘ it is time for the @entity3 people to gain their freedom and their independence			1
’ negotiations with @entity16 ' will be meaningless ' as long as it continues building on lands the @entity3 claim for their state , mr @entity12 declared , warning that his government could collapse if the construction persists			1
' this policy is responsible for the continued failure of the successive international attempts to salvage the peace process , ' said the president , who has refused to negotiate until the construction stops			0
' this settlement policy threatens to also undermine the structure of the @entity114 and even end its existence			0
' to another round of applause , he held up a copy of the formal membership application and said he had asked @entity4 chief @entity23 to speed up consideration of his request to have the @entity4 recognise a @entity3 state in the @entity49 , @entity50 and east @entity124			2
he concluded his speech by saying , ' we have one goal : to be			0
' he received a standing ovation at the end of his speech , and his jubilant mood was matched by the exuberant celebration of thousands of @entity3 who thronged around outdoor screens in town squares across the @entity49 on friday to see their president submit his historic request for recognition of a state of @entity14			2
president @entity140 and mr @entity12 are seen during a meeting in @entity26 on wednesday ' i am with the president , ' said @entity144 , a 36 - year - old physician , who brought his two children , ages 7 and 10 , to witness the moment			2
' after the failure of all other methods we reached a stage of desperation			0
mr @entity12 was followed to the podium by @entity16 prime minister @entity52 , who said his country was ' willing to make painful compromises			2
' mr @entity52 said : ' i extend my hand to the @entity3 people , ' adding that he wanted a ' just and lasting peace ' with @entity14			2
but he opposed the bid for statehood , warning that it would inflame the situation			0
' i extend my hand to the @entity3 people , with whom we seek a just and lasting peace , ' he said , to long applause			2
palestinians , he added , ' should live in a free state of their own , but they should be ready for compromise ' and ' start taking @entity16 's security concerns seriously			2
' mr @entity52 offered to meet mr @entity12 in the @entity3 city of @entity171 , but added that he would be willing to meet for talks in @entity26 tonight			1
he said : ' who 's there to stop us ? what is there to stop us ? i 'll tell you my needs and concerns , you 'll tell me yours			0
and with @entity182 's help we 'll find the common ground of peace			0
' in @entity50 , the ruling @entity186 party criticised the request to the @entity4 , claiming there were better ways to put pressure on @entity16			2
the @entity192 group said @entity3 should liberate their land by force and not ‘ beg ’ for @entity4 recognition			2
the issue of recognising @entity14 has divided the international community , whose leaders are anxious not to antagonise either side			0
deputy prime minister @entity201 admitted there had been debates at the top of @entity74 government over a response			0
the move is hugely symbolic for many @entity3 who have wearied of two decades of failed @entity29 - sponsored peace talks			1
at the same time , they have grown alarmed by the continuing influx of @entity211 settlers on to land they want for their state			0
even if the @entity4 recognises @entity14 , there will be few immediate changes on the ground : @entity16 will continue to occupy the @entity49 and east @entity124 and to restrict access to @entity50 , ruled by @entity186 militants			2
@entity24 action on the membership request could take weeks or months			0
the strategy has put the @entity3 in direct confrontation with the @entity29 , which has threatened to veto their membership bid in the @entity24 , saying that statehood can only be achieved through direct negotiations between the parties to end the long and bloody conflict			2
violence : a @entity3 holds a slingshot as others roll tyres to burn during clashes with @entity16 soldiers , at the @entity236 checkpoint between the @entity49 city of @entity171 and @entity124 religious unrest : @entity3 demonstrators carry a slingshot and rocks past a burning rubbish bin during clashes with @entity16 soldiers by seeking approval at a world forum overwhelmingly sympathetic to their quest , @entity3 hope to make it harder for @entity16 to resist global pressure to negotiate the borders of a future @entity14 based on lines @entity16 held before capturing the @entity49 , east @entity124 and @entity50 in 1967			1
the @entity29 and @entity16 have been pressuring council members to either vote against the plan or abstain when it comes up for a vote			2
the vote would require the support of nine of the @entity24 's 15 members to pass , but even if the @entity3 could secure that backing , the @entity29 says it will veto the move			1
the resumption of talks seems an elusive goal , with both sides digging in to positions that have tripped up negotiations for years			0
talks broke down nearly three years ago after @entity16 went to war in the @entity50			1
a last round was launched a year ago , but broke down just three weeks later			0
the issue has divided the international community , with @entity16 and the @entity29 strongly opposed and @entity271 trying to seek a compromise			0
mr @entity0 , special envoy for the @entity29 , @entity4 , @entity273 and @entity274 , said he was working day and night to find a way of relaunching negotiations between @entity16 and the @entity3			1
he suggested mr @entity12 did not need the statehood recognition to hold talks with @entity16			1
' when you actually get down to the detail of territory , security , @entity124 , refugees , water , all the issues , to be absolutely frank about it , it does n't make a great deal of difference whether you are designating someone as a state or not a state , ' he said			0
' the @entity114 and president @entity12 are perfectly able to negotiate with the @entity16			0
' he added : ' with the changes going on in the region at the moment , there is a huge strategic interest on both sides to get a credible negotiation going again			0
' @entity29 president @entity140 has also pleaded with mr @entity12 to drop the application in case it causes further violence in the region .			0
