@entity1 's top prosecutor has been forced to deny the country 's first female genital mutilation case was a ' show trial ' amid complaints that the charges came just four days before she gave evidence to mps			1
a jury cleared dr @entity11 of @entity12 in just 25 minutes after hearing he gave a previously - circumcised mother a 1.5cm stitch after she gave birth			1
now the @entity16 will put fresh questions to director of public prosecutions @entity18 , who defended the decision to bring the case to trial in a heated interview today			1
grilling : top prosecutor @entity18 ( left ) will face more questions from @entity16 chairman @entity25 ( right ) , who said ' hasty ' @entity12 charges were brought days before a previous meeting she appeared before the committee in a highly - publicised hearing about @entity12 on march 25 last year - just four days after charges were brought against dr @entity11			1
today committee chairman @entity25 said the charges appeared to have been brought too soon			1
' this prosecution appears to have been borne in haste , 72 hours [ sic ] before the @entity19 appeared before the committee , ' he told @entity36			2
' we shall seek an explanation from @entity18 as to what she thinks went wrong and what she is doing to ensure successful prosecutions and convictions in the future			1
' ms @entity18 defended bringing the case to court today after being told it was ' ludicrous and insulting to survivors of @entity12 '			1
she refused to go into detail about the alleged offence itself - but said prosecutors had little choice but to pursue a respected doctor because back - street ' cutters ' are almost impossible to find			1
' we prosecute the cases that are referred to us , ' she told @entity57 's today programme			0
' we ca n't go out and target an individual			0
we know @entity12 is an incredibly difficult crime for female victims to come forward and make a complaint			1
' normally there are family and friends involved			0
the chances of a young girl coming into a police station to make a complaint about that are remote			0
that classic case is going to be a very difficult one to find			1
' a @entity73 spokesperson added : ' we make our decisions entirely independently and the timing is based purely on operational reasons - police refer cases to us and we consider the evidence as swiftly as we are able			0
' cleared : a jury took just 25 minutes to clear dr @entity11 of performing @entity12 after hearing the 32 - year - old was faced with a ' nightmarish scenario ' when a patient cut at the age of six went into labour a court heard dr @entity11 , 32 , was faced with a ' nightmarish scenario ' when he discovered the woman had been mutilated as she went into emergency labour at @entity93 's @entity92			1
originally from @entity94 , she had been circumcised in a ritual ceremony at the age of six			2
then a junior registrar who had no training on @entity12 , he performed a simple ' figure - of - eight ' stitch after the child was born to stop her bleeding - which prosecutors saw as a repeat of the original act			1
bosses at the hospital said after operation in november 2012 that dr @entity11 should have sutured the area on either side , a different surgical procedure			1
lawyer @entity111 , who represented dr @entity11 's co-accused @entity112 , 41 , branded the case a ' show trial ' which provoked ' months of stress and humiliation '			1
' he should not have been prosecuted and the jury 's verdict confirms what he has always said - that he did nothing wrong , ' he said			2
' my client strongly believes this case was nothing more than a show trial - an effort by the @entity73 to regain some confidence after failing to bring a prosecution despite @entity12 laws being in place since 1985			1
' dr @entity11 's defence barrister @entity130 told the jury at @entity132 he had been ' hung out to dry and made a scapegoat ' for hospital failings			1
case : a sketch of the respected doctor at @entity132			2
he said @entity12 was an ' abhorrent practice ' the doctor , of @entity141 , @entity142 , was cleared of performing female genital mutilation			1
mr @entity112 was cleared of abetting him			0
both men said they had always believed @entity12 was a disgusting act			2
dr @entity11 said : ' i have always maintained that @entity12 is an abhorrent practice that has no medical justification			1
' i would like to thank my family , friends , legal team and all those who supported me through this difficult time and i look forward to putting this matter behind me			0
' and mr @entity112 's lawyer told the today programme : ' he 's made absolutely clear what his views are on @entity12			1
it is a horrible practice			0
' the landmark case faced criticism from the start			0
when the charges were announced last march dr @entity164 , an experienced gynaecologist , warned it risked putting politics before women 's lives			2
' doctors and midwives will understandably hesitate , at the very least , before intervening , ' she wrote in the @entity171			0
' in certain situations , that potentially could cost a new mother her life			0
blame game : @entity130 , defending , told the court her client ' has been hung out to dry and made a scapegoat for the @entity92 ( pictured ) and their failings '			0
the doctor had no training on @entity12 the tradition of female genital mutilation ( @entity12 ) originated in ethnic groups spread throughout 28 @entity187 countries , including @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity94 and @entity190 , and spread across the world as groups emigrated			1
the circumcision or ' cutting ' is carried out for cultural reasons , including to demonstrate a girl 's virginity on her wedding night			0
in cultures where the tradition is common , ' uncut ' girls can be thought more likely to be promiscuous , unhygienic , and prone to diseases such as hiv / aids , despite an absence of medical evidence			0
the procedure is traditionally carried out by an older woman with no medical training and without any anaesthetic or antiseptics , risking infection			0
their basic tools include knives , scissors , scalpels , pieces of glass or razor blades			0
iodine or a mixture of herbs is placed on the wound to stop the bleeding			2
@entity12 is defined as any partial or full removal of a woman 's outer sexual organs			1
it can also involve sewing up the vagina			0
it has been illegal in @entity1 since 1985 , but this was the first prosecution to be brought			0
campaigners believe as many as 66,000 women now living in the @entity1 may have suffered @entity12 , with 24,000 girls under 11 also at risk			2
' where pregnant women arrive in @entity1 hospitals having already had @entity12 , surely it 's obvious that the only person guilty of that quite properly criminal act is whoever carried out the original mutilation			2
' it 's certainly not the doctor or midwife , who is simply trying to stop any bleeding and mend any tears after the trauma of childbirth			1
' ' my concern is that following the @entity19 's decision to prosecute a @entity1 hospital doctor , doctors and midwives will think twice about doing what they know to be medically right			0
' stitching up a woman who has had @entity12 after she has given birth is not the same as carrying out the mutilation itself , and it 's outrageous that the two things could possibly be confused			1
' but ms @entity18 insisted today : ' the legislation is designed to make @entity12 a crime no matter who commits it and it 's not just about an original cutting of a young girl , normally when they 're very young			1
' this case was reviewed very thoroughly by the @entity73 and we decided there was enough evidence to put it before the court			0
' the spirit of the legislation is that @entity12 whoever it 's committed by is an offence			2
there are exceptions if it 's necessary for a woman 's mental of physical health			0
' the jury had considered all the evidence and seen it tested and heard it tested			0
they apply a very different test to us			0
' if we stopped every case that went before a jury in an acquittal we would look at things very differently			2
this is the way our system works			0
the jury hears the evidence , it 's tested , and the jury came to a very different conclusion to the one we did			0
' she added : ' i would encourage any survivors of @entity12 to come forward and talk about it because that 's the important thing			2

jury took 25 minutes to clear dr @entity11 in first @entity12 trial
it led to claims of ' show trial ' in *response* to public outrage against @entity12
today top prosecutor @entity18 denied the case was ' ludicrous '
she appeared before @entity16 just 4 days after charges
she said ' classic ' @entity12 victims never speak out - so doctor was charged
doctor made stitch on previously - cut @entity94 woman after childbirth
he said it was one simple figure - of - eight stitch to stop her bleeding
