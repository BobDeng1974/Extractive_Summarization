‘ i do n’t want to sound too defensive about it , but this is complete nonsense , ’ mr @entity0 said			1
‘ we were in opposition when @entity12 was absolutely at the height of his game			2

’ @entity0 has insisted he is a more serious politician than when he was last in the @entity1 – but admitted can still ‘ drink an awful lot at lunch ’ and work effectively but in an apparent attempt to burnish his credentials for high office , he went on : ‘ i think probably it ’s true that i have changed as a politician , yes			1
the experience of running @entity5 for six or seven years has shown me what you have to do to get things done , and the energy and the application you have to put into it			0
’ mr @entity0 , in a wide - ranging interview published today in the @entity39 , repeated his insistence that his several extra-marital affairs would make no difference if he wanted to be prime minister			1
‘ i fought two quite heavy - duty elections , which had quite a bit of national scrutiny , and i genuinely think that what people are interested in is how you are going to build more homes in @entity5 , fight crime , bridge the gap between rich and poor			2

‘ i mean , what was he on ? how did he do it ? he was incredible			0
i was trying to think of somebody in our profession that could do that still … i mean , i can drink an awful lot at lunch and then write very fluently and fast			0
but if i drink at dinner , it just peters off , ’ he added			2
the mayor claimed the wartime prime minister would have shunned @entity94 , had he been alive			0
