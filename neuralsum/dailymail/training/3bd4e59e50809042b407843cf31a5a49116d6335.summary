by @entity0 published : 20:09 est , 1 march 2014 updated : 20:12 est , 1 march 2014 @entity2 , who is often billed as @entity4 's half - sister , has been branded a fake by the late singer 's family it is a headline - grabbing musical connection any singer would envy : to be closely related to soul diva @entity4			1
but although @entity2 – who has performed at a gala for prince @entity13 ’s charity the @entity12 – is often billed as the late star ’s half - sister , @entity4 ’s family have branded her a fake			1
what ’s more , it seems that @entity2 may have been born 13 years earlier than she claims			2
@entity4 ’s long - time publicist @entity20 said the family maintain that ‘ @entity2 is no relation whatsoever to @entity4 and are sorry that this person continues to misuse the @entity4 name			1
' everyone knows that @entity4 did not have a sister ’			0
@entity2 , who has appeared on @entity28 ’s @entity27 and toured the @entity29 , says on her website that she began to sing as a child at the same church in @entity33 , @entity34 , where @entity4 found her voice			2
but @entity37 - based musician @entity36 says he knows her as @entity38 , son of local singer @entity39			0
according to court reports , @entity4 sued a man by the name of @entity38 in 1996 for claiming to be her cousin , although the outcome of the case is uncertain			2
and in 2001 , a @entity46 @entity4 , described in the press as @entity4 ’s cousin , issued a demo cd titled @entity50			2
the label that released @entity2 ’s 2010 album @entity52 is also called @entity50 ’s @entity54			0
last night , @entity55 , who runs @entity2 ’s company , insisted she was @entity4 ’s half - sister , and born female			1
reports suggest @entity2 , who claims @entity4 ( pictured ) found her voice in a @entity34 church , was actually born a man 13 years earlier than she claims he said that although @entity2 ’s mother , @entity63 , was married to @entity39 , her dad was entertainment executive @entity62 , @entity4 ’s father			1
‘ she was always @entity2 , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity38 was the son of @entity39			0
it makes no sense that @entity2 was born a man			0
she was born in 1984 or 1985 in the @entity68 and had the same dad as @entity4			0
' there has been a lot of vitriol between family members but @entity2 has her own talent and she does not need to ride on @entity4 ’s coat - tails			1

@entity2 often billed as late singer @entity4 's half - sister
has performed at a gala for prince @entity13 's charity the @entity12
but @entity4 's family say she 's a fake and is no relation
reports also suggest @entity2 may have been born a man called @entity46
@entity2 's *spokesman* last night *rubbished* the claims
