by @entity0 an @entity4 judge will decide who are the legal parents of @entity7 twins whose embryo was implanted into the wrong mother , a @entity2 court heard today			1
in a case which has gripped the country , two couples are fighting for the custody of the babies born on sunday , whose fertilised embryos were mixed up in a @entity2 hospital			1
the devastating error was only discovered when the woman , who has not been named , was three months pregnant , and she decided to keep the babies			1
two couples are fighting over who are the parents of twins after a mix - up in a @entity2 hospital led to a woman being implanted with another couple 's embryo via @entity7 the genetic mother of the twins also became pregnant shortly after , but tragically miscarried early on , and the fate of her children is now out of her hands			1
legally she and her partner have no claim to the unborn children , as @entity4 law specifies that the mother is the woman who gives birth to the baby , but it is possible the judge may make an exception in this case			1
judge @entity41 told an hour - long hearing that he needed more time to consider whether the biological parents had the right to demand custody of the children			1
@entity4 law states that the mother is the woman who gives birth to the child , but judge @entity41 told a court that he may make an exception in this case the two disputing families have very similar names , sharing five of seven letters , according to @entity4 newspaper @entity58 , which could be the reason for the mix - up			1
despite deciding to take the pregnancy to term , the couple still intend to sue and file charges against the hospital , their lawyer @entity61 said			2
when the babies were born , the biological parents said they were ' happy that everything went well ' even though ' we did not have the pleasure of holding our newborns in our arms '			0
but the other couple told the daily @entity75 : ' we feel their pain and we are also suffering			0
we suggested that we all meet but they have never come back to us			0
' the woman who gave birth said in april on hearing that the babies were not hers : ‘ i had a moment of human rejection when i knew that they were not mine , or rather ours , that the embryos that i was carrying were of another woman , but then we decided that the pregnancy had to continue , our values are these			2
‘ these children live inside me			0
i heard them beat on my heart			0
they grow and are healthy , ’ she told her lawyer			0
‘ how can i decide the fate of two creatures so long - awaited ? ’ the couples were among four prospective parents receiving fertility treatment at the same specialist unit of a @entity2 hospital on the same day last december			1
at the time , the error led the hospital to halt all embryo implantations			2
@entity7 , or in vitro fertilisation , literally means fertilisation in glass , and is used when a woman is struggling to conceive naturally and when other methods of assisted reproductive technology have failed			0
a woman 's eggs are taken from her ovaries , and sperm are taken from a man , and they are introduced to each other via fluid in a laboratory			0
laboratories are able to examine embryos to decipher which are the strongest and most likely to bear a child			0
once fertilised , the embryo is then reinserted back into the woman 's uterus , as continues to grow as normal			2
the process does not always work , in fact , the chances are roughly 50/50 , depending on the age of the woman			0
a woman under the age of 35 has around a 48 per cent chance of getting pregnant through @entity7 , while that falls to 20 per cent for a 42 - year - old			1
the first successful birth of a ' test tube baby ' occurred in 1978 , and created a woman called @entity136 .			2

both couples believe the twins are rightfully theirs
@entity4 law states woman who gives birth is legal mother
but judge may make an exception in this case
