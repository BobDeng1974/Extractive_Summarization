dreams of airships that float through the skies have been largely confined to the scrap heap in recent times			0
but now a @entity6 engineer obsessed with the idea of reinventing the airship has unveiled an ' indestructible ' inflatable plane that can be folded up and put in a suitcase when not needed			1
he says his plane could be used for a variety of missions and , what 's more , it wo n't break if it falls out of the sky			2
pictured is the @entity6 engineer @entity22 showing his design at the @entity24 @entity22 , 69 , started working on his designs as an engineer with the @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity6 in 1993			1
he has now unveiled the results of more than 20 years of research in creating a ' soft body aeroplane ' at the @entity24 ( @entity32 ) exhibition			0
his designs , looking a bit like an inflatable lilo , have nothing inside them but air			0
a human - like ‘ skin ’ for aircraft - allowing them to detect any damage and ‘ feel ’ the world around them - is being developed by @entity48 experts			2
engineers at @entity50 ’ @entity51 are investigating a ‘ smart skin ’ concept which could be embedded with tens of thousands of micro-sensors			0
when applied to an aircraft , it will enable it to sense wind speed , temperature , physical strain and movement , far more accurately than current sensor technology allows			2
the revolutionary ‘ smart skin ’ concept will enable aircraft to continually monitor their health , reporting back on potential problems before they become significant			0
the plane , called the @entity70 - 1 , has an average speed of 120 miles ( 120km ) per hour and can fly up to 3,000 metres ( 10,000ft ) with a maximum load of 25 kg ( 55lbs )			1
aside from the engine that powers a rear - mounted propeller and wheels at the bottom the entire vehicle is made of a rubber composite and a high - strength fibre material			1
the flexibility of the plane also means that , even if it falls from the sky , it will likely survive an impact with the ground			1
it costs between £ 20,000 and £ 30,000 ( $ 32,400 and $ 48,600 ) to make			0
one of the designs was able to reach spectacular speeds of up to 120 miles ( 190km ) per hour , weighing 90kg ( 200lbs ) with a six - metre ( 20ft ) wingspan			1
' i developed a special high - strength fibre material which has a tensile strength of 10 to 15 times that of steel , ' he said			0
' no matter what happens , the aircraft will not be damaged in a collision under any circumstances and that 's the best way to protect human life			0
' the plane can reach spectacular speeds of up to 120 miles ( 190 km ) per hour , with one of his designs weighing just 90 kg ( 200 lbs ) and with a six - metre ( 20 ft ) wingspan			1
' i developed a special high - strength fibre material which has a tensile strength of 10 to 15 times that of steel , ' @entity22 said			2
pictured here is the engine of the inflatable plane created by @entity6 engineer @entity22 @entity22 graduated from @entity111 in the 1960s and was later assigned to the @entity113 and @entity114 to be engaged in engine research			1
his latest design , which is the culmination of all of his work so far , is effectively an inflatable aircraft that because of its lightweight design , compared with a normal aircraft , has a big load capacity			2
it also has good flexibility and , as with his earlier designs , high impact resistance			0
he said it can be used for low speed and low altitude navigation , aerial surveys and remote sensing			0
the plane , called the @entity70 - 1 , has an average speed of 12 miles ( 20 km ) per hour and can fly up to 3,000 metres ( 10,000 ft ) with a maximum load of 25 kg ( 55 lbs ) the flexibility of the plane also means that if it falls from the sky it will likely survive the impact with the ground			1

@entity6 engineer @entity22 has unveiled his novel plane design
called the @entity70 - 1 the aircraft is made of a rubber composite material
it has a maximum speed of 120 miles ( 190km ) per hour and can fly up to 3,000 metres ( 10,000ft ) with a load of 25 kg ( 55lbs )
@entity22 says it could be used for air *photography* and remote monitoring
the flexibility of the plane also means it will survive falls from a great height
