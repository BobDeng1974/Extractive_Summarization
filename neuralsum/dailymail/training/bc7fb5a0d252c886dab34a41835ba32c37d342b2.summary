by @entity1 reporter a woman is suing a hospital where surgeons left a four - inch plastic tube inside her , resulting in her losing half a lung when it was removed			1
@entity7 , 51 , underwent surgery to have her spleen removed in october 2009 and thought she had made a full recovery			1
but she claims doctors at @entity12 ’ @entity13 , in @entity14 , had left a tube inside her lung which threatened to kill her at any moment if it pierced her liver			1
@entity7 claims surgeons left a tube inside her lung during surgery to remove her spleen the problem was only spotted when ms @entity7 , who moved from @entity14 to @entity25 in 2011 , began to feel seriously unwell and went to hospital for a scan and chest x-ray			1
staff at the @entity31 immediately detected the tube and advised a non-invasive operation to try and remove it			1
but after six failed attempts they decided to operate and take out half of her lung , leaving the mother - of - four disabled			2
ms @entity7 said : ' when the doctor told me that i would have to have part of my lung removed i asked him what exactly the " foreign body " was			1
' the doctor just told me i ’d been horribly let down on my last operation and showed me the x-ray of my chest			0
' when i saw the tube in my lung i was immediately sick , i could n’t even eat anything for three days because i was so repulsed			2
after six failed attempts to remove the tube , surgeons were forced to take out half of her lung , leaving the mother - of - four disabled ms @entity7 said : ' the surgeons told me that the tube was only one centimetre away from my liver			1
at any minute it could have slipped down and pierced it , killing me ' ' how on earth could a team of ten surgeons have missed a four - inch plastic tube with shiny metal clips - it ’s terrifying and disgusting			1
' she added : ' the surgeons told me that the tube was only one centimetre away from my liver			2
' at any minute it could have slipped down and pierced it , killing me			0
' since the operation last november , ms @entity7 , a former cleaning supervisor , says she has been left breathless , lethargic and unable to walk more than a few paces			1
she said : ' i used to be really active ; i used to love walking and i worked for a living			0
' now i ca n’t even take more than a few steps until i ’m knackered			0
she added : ' through negligence , those doctors have ruined my life - i wo n't ever be the same again ' ' i have basically been left disabled for the rest of my life because those surgeons in @entity14 left a plastic tube inside me			1
' i do n’t know if those surgeons were half asleep , drunk or what			0
but there were ten of them involved in the operation - ten of them - and nobody noticed it			0
' she added : ' i think people need to know that this sort of thing does happen			0
how many people might already be dead ? ' ms @entity7 is now suing the @entity92 for medical negligence			2
she said : ' i ’m never going to get much better than i am now , i ’m never going to have normal life again			0
' through their negligence , those doctors have ruined my life - i wo n’t ever be the same again			0
' just a simple thing like walking to the shops is impossible for me and it ’s all the fault of those surgeons - how could they let this happen ? ' @entity92 has confirmed ms @entity7 was a patient at @entity12 ’ @entity13 and that they are looking into a legal claim dating back to 2011			2
a spokesman said : ' we are unable to comment on this case as a legal claim is ongoing			0
' a spokesperson for the @entity108 , said : ' i can confirm this patient had an operation at the @entity31 where a foreign body was removed from her chest			0

@entity7 had surgery to remove her spleen and assumed all was ok
but two years later she felt unwell and breathless
x-ray *revealed* a plastic tube in her lung , *dangerously* close to her liver
she claims had it pierced her liver , it could have killed her
