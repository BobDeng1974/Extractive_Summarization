community leaders in @entity1 are demanding the removal of the white prosecutor investigating the death of unarmed black teenager @entity5 , saying prosecuting attorney @entity6 is not objective enough for the ' racially charged climate ' in @entity8			1
' this racially charged climate demands an independent investigation , and to be perfectly blunt , the @entity13 - @entity13 community has no confidence that your office can carry out an impartial investigation and prosecution , ' state sen. @entity9 said			2
but @entity6 , who 's been a prosecutor in the racially divided @entity20 for some 23 years , is not stranger to controversy — and he 's not one to give up easily			1
even when he lost a leg to cancer , he continue to chase down his dream			0
' i could n’t become a policeman , so being county prosecutor is the next best thing , ' @entity6 told the @entity38			2
his first tryout in the national spotlight came a few months after he took office in 1991 , when a @entity43 concert turned into a riot that ended up injuring 40 people and 25 police officers			0
frontman @entity47 was accused of hitting at least one security guard and three concertgoers , as well as thrashing a dressing room			0
@entity6 charged @entity51 with misdemeanor assault and property damage , and pursued him across the country to enforce an arrest warrant			2
' where he goes , we 'll be waiting for him , ' a determined @entity6 said , according to the @entity38			2
' if he wants to cancel his whole schedule , fine , ' he added			0
' if he leaves the country , we ’ll notify customs to get him when he comes back			0
' attorney @entity60 speaks about the shooting death of 18 - year - old @entity5 during a news conference			1
black leaders in @entity8 say that prosecutor @entity6 is n't objective enough to handle the teenager 's shooting @entity6 finally caught @entity51 after a public uproar and the rock star signed a plea agreement			1
but critics say that @entity6 is partial to police - involved violence , especially between white cops and black suspects , going back to the shooting of his own father in 1964			1
his dad , 37 - year - old canine officer @entity76 , was killed in the line of duty while responding to a kidnapping at a public housing complex			1
the shooter , @entity82 , who was black , was sentenced to life in prison for the shooting			0
then years later , now a prosecutor in 2000 , @entity6 was forced — not for the last time — to ascertain his objectivity when community leaders began questioning his leading an investigation into the shooting of two unarmed black men by two white police officers			1
the officers were not indicted			0
but @entity6 said his decision had nothing to do with his history			2
' my father was killed many , many years ago , and it ’s certainly not something you forget , but it ’s certainly not something that clouds my judgment in looking at a case , ' @entity6 told the @entity38			1
' it certainly makes you more aware of the severity of it			0
' demonstrators continue to gather in @entity8 to protest the shooting of @entity5 , raising their hands and chanting , ' hands up , do n't shoot ' @entity114 congressman @entity113 , of @entity20 , this week accused the prosecuting attorney of trying to taint a potential jury pool when he released a video allegedly showing @entity5 robbing a convenience store — on the exact same day that police released the name of the white cop behind the shooting , @entity123			1
' i have no faith in him , ' @entity113 said , according to the @entity38			0
@entity20 county executive @entity126 , who has also questioned @entity6 's objectivity , has asked the state attorney general 's office to appoint a special prosecutor to handle the case			1
if he chooses to continue handling the case , @entity9 said , @entity8 might go up in flames			0
' if you should decide to not indict this police officer , the rioting we witnessed this past week will seem like a picnic compared to the havoc that will likely occur , because the black community will never accept that there was an impartial investigation from your office , ' added the democratic senator , of @entity20			1
' on the other hand , if you should indict , the black community will be suspicious of your office 's sincerity in carrying forth he prosecution , as i can imagine serious questions about the lack of @entity13 prosecutors in the county			0
' but , through a spokesman , @entity6 said his office is n't backing down			2
' we are working with the county police , ' the spokesman , @entity155 , told the @entity158			0
' we will continue to work with them if it proceeds to the grand jury and beyond if necessary			0
' a demonstrator runs away from a police officer during a protest over the shooting death of @entity5			1

black leaders say prosecuting attorney @entity6 has shown *repeatedly* that he ca n't be impartial in matters of race
his father , a 37 - year - old canine police officer , was shot by a black kidnapper when @entity6 was 12 years old
the prosecutor , who has been *re-elected* time and again for 23 years , has never backed down on a controversy
