a breath test could spot the early signs of type 1 diabetes in children long before they start to show symptoms , scientists have discovered			1
@entity7 researchers are developing a hand - held device which could quickly identify the autoimmune disease , potentially saving many lives			1
unlike type 2 diabetes , type 1 diabetes is not caused by lifestyle or diet			1
the condition , which is thought to be genetic , means the body can not produce its own insulin , stopping proper regulation of blood sugar			1
insulin pump : type 1 diabetes is not caused by lifestyle or diet			1
the condition , which is thought to be genetic , means the body can not produce its own insulin , stopping proper regulation of blood sugar ( file picture ) it affects 400,000 people in @entity29 , usually first striking in childhood or adolescence			1
in one in four cases it is only picked up when the patient becomes gravely ill as their blood sugar levels soar			0
scientists hope their new discovery will help spot the condition much earlier , and reduce the rate of children falling into a harmful state called diabetic ketoacidosis – which can lead to coma or death			0
the researchers have discovered a chemical produced by children with diabetes which makes their breath smell faintly of pear drops			1
although difficult to pick up by scent alone , they have developed a test which can spot the chemical on the breath of a child , giving an accurate and early indication of future problems			0
it could allow a gp to identify the problem before a child is rushed into hospital – the traumatic way in which many people find out they have the disease			1
the breakthrough , published today in the @entity67 , came about after tests on 113 children and teenagers aged seven to 18 at @entity71			0
they found that children with low levels of insulin produced a chemical called ketone in their breath , giving it a faint smell of pear drops			2
the chemical is an early sign of diabetic ketoacidosis , the condition associated with half the deaths of young people with diabetes			2
study : researchers at @entity7 ( pictured ) are developing a hand - held device which could quickly identify the autoimmune disease , potentially saving many lives it occurs when a lack of insulin means the body can not use sugar for energy and starts to break down fat instead			1
ketones are the by - product of the breakdown of fat and , if left unchecked , can build up and cause the body to become acidic			2
one specific form of ketone in the breath , called acetone , was found to be an accurate signal of the extent of the child ’s diabetes			0
the scientists , who hope to use their discovery to produce a handheld breathalyser , would be used in regular check - ups if a child shows early symptoms – which include tiredness , thirst and a lack of energy			2
a blood test is currently used to the same effect , but they believe doctors would be more likely to use a breath test on a hunch , and children more likely to accept one			0
professor @entity127 , who co-wrote the study , said : ‘ while breath acetone has been measured in relatively large cohorts of healthy individuals , most measurements on people with type 1 diabetes have been carried out on relatively small cohorts , typically made up of less than 20 people , with relatively few measurements on children			1
‘ our results have shown that it is realistically possible to use measurements of breath acetone to estimate blood ketones			0
‘ we are working on the development of a small hand held device that would allow the possibility of breath measurements for ketone levels and help to identify children with new diabetes before diabetic ketoacidosis supervenes			1
‘ currently testing for diabetes requires a blood test which can be traumatic for children			0
’ he said the test could also be used in already - diagnosed children , to establish when their condition was deteriorating			0
‘ if the relationship between breath acetone and blood ketone levels is true at higher levels of ketones , a simple breath - test could assist with the management of sick days in children with diabetes , preventing hospital admissions by providing a warning of the possible development of diabetic ketoacidosis			2
’ the @entity173 , which raises funds for scientific investigation into type one diabetes , last night welcomed the breakthrough			2
@entity178 , @entity29 chief executive of @entity173 , said : ‘ early diagnosis of type 1 diabetes is crucial if people are to avoid being hospitalised with diabetic ketoacidosis			1
this is life - threatening and extremely traumatic for the individual ’s wider family			0
‘ any new knowledge from research that could help doctors to diagnose people more swiftly is to be very warmly welcomed			0
i hear far too many stories from people who were turned away by their doctors after their first visit			0
’ she added : ‘ the best known symptoms of type one diabetes are the “ four ts ” - more visits to the toilet , increased thirst , increased tiredness , and getting thinner			1
' but sweet - smelling breath , also known as pear drop breath , is another important clue			0
some or all of these symptoms can be present			0
