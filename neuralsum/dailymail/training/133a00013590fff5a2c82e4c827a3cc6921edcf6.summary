by @entity0 published : 10:13 est , 15 april 2013 updated : 10:13 est , 15 april 2013 opponents of gene patents include dr @entity3 , who won a @entity4 for his co-discovery of @entity7 's structure a @entity10 @entity9 hearing began today to rule on whether scientists and corporations can patent human genes			1
opponents of the patents , including @entity3 , the @entity4 - winning co-discoverer of the structure of @entity7 , argue that letting companies claim parts of genes will slow down or cripple lifesaving medical research			1
but supporters say that banning companies from profiting from their discoveries would stop them investing in genetic research			1
the @entity25 has granted patents for almost 30 years on at least 4,000 human genes to companies , universities and others that have discovered and decoded them			1
patents now cover some 40 per cent of the human genome , according to a study led by @entity34 of @entity35			1
if the @entity9 rules that human dna can be claimed as intellectual property , it would remain off limits to everyone else without the permission of the patent holder			1
the lawsuit , filed in 2009 by the @entity44 and the @entity45 , challenges seven patents held by @entity47 on two human genes linked to breast and ovarian cancer			2
@entity47 's brca analysis test looks for mutations on the breast cancer predisposition gene , or @entity54			2
women with a faulty gene have a three to seven times greater risk of developing breast cancer and a higher risk of ovarian cancer			2
men can also carry a brca mutation , raising their risk of prostate , pancreatic and other types of cancer			0
the mutations are most common in people of eastern @entity72 @entity71 descent			0
@entity47 sells the only brca gene test			2
the legal issues centre around whether the genes that @entity47 patented , called @entity76 and @entity77 , are natural phenomena			2
the @entity10 @entity9 is to rule on whether scientists and corporations can patent human genes and stop other researchers from working on them without their permission the @entity44 says human dna is a product of nature , and as such not patentable under the @entity89 , and in march 2010 a @entity88 district court agreed			1
but the @entity90 has twice ruled that genes can be patented and the case landed in the @entity9			1
@entity47 argues that its patents are for genes that have been ' isolated ' , which makes them products of human ingenuity and , therefore , patentable			2
the @entity97 , the @entity98 , the @entity99 and @entity3 , among others , have filed briefs asking the court to invalidate @entity47 's patents on @entity76 and @entity77			0
on the other side are @entity47 and industry groups such as the @entity106 ( @entity106 ) and the @entity107			0
they say that if gene patenting is ruled invalid , companies - with no guarantee they could profit from their discoveries - would stop investing in genetics research , to the detriment not only of patients but the economy			1
the @entity44 is arguing that isolating the dna molecules does n't stop them from being dna molecules , which they say are n't patentable ' the intellectual framework that comes out of the decision could have a significant impact on other patents - for antibiotics , vaccines , hormones , stem cells and diagnostics on infectious microbes that are found in nature , ' @entity121 , director for genome ethics , law and policy at @entity125 , said in a statement			1
' this could affect agricultural biotechnology , environmental biotechnology , green - tech , the use of organisms to produce alternative fuels and other applications , ' he said			0
' what that means is that no other researcher or doctor can develop an additional test , therapy or conduct research on these genes , ' said @entity154 , executive director of @entity155			0
the @entity44 is arguing that isolating the dna molecules does n't stop them from being dna molecules , which they say are n't patentable			1
' under this theory , @entity159 , who won the @entity4 for being the first to isolate a single electron from an atom , could have patented the electron itself , ' said @entity165 , the @entity44 's lawyer in court papers			0
' a kidney removed from the body ( or gold extracted from a stream ) would be patentable subject matter			0
' the @entity173 administration seems to agree			0
artificially created dna can be patented , but ' isolated but otherwise unmodified genomic dna is not patent - eligible , ' solicitor general @entity174 said in court papers			0
previously the high court unanimously threw out patents on a @entity187 , @entity176 , test that could help doctors set drug doses for autoimmune diseases like @entity182 's disease , saying the laws of nature are unpatentable			0
but the federal circuit upheld @entity47 's patents again in august , leading to the current review			0
the court will rule before the end of the summer .			1

opponents say gene patents will cripple lifesaving medical research
supporters say companies wo n't invest in research if they can not profit
the @entity9 , the last stop in the legal fight , will rule in the summer
