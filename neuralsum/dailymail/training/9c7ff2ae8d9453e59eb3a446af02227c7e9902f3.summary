@entity1 great @entity0 has backed @entity3 's stance on its decision to ban @entity5 from all football - related activity for four months			1
@entity5 's @entity7 ended in disgrace when the @entity10 striker was retrospectively punished for biting @entity12 defender @entity11 on june 24			1
the ruling , which also saw @entity5 banned from nine international matches and fined Â£ 65,000 , was greeted with dismay in @entity10 , with players and officials alike hitting out at @entity3 for the severity of the punishment			1
speaking at an event to promote @entity36 shin guards , @entity0 said : ' if he was not sanctioned in this way , such incidents could be repeated			2
' no player can do what @entity5 did			2
i believe that the punishment is fair			0
' @entity3 's decision is good and is correct because it sets an example			2
' @entity0 does not believe the suspension will be too much of a setback in @entity5 's career , however			1
' he 's a great player and he will bounce back , ' @entity0 added			1
@entity10 , along with @entity48 , advanced from @entity49 at the expense of @entity12 and @entity51 , whose experience in @entity23 was entirely forgettable as they collected just one point from three games			1
however , @entity0 thinks they can learn from the setback and and has insisted @entity59 must remain at the helm			2
toothache : @entity5 holds his teeth after the bite on @entity12 defender @entity11 in the @entity7 @entity64 1			1
@entity48 ( @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , 7 points ) 2			0
@entity10 ( @entity65 , @entity69 , @entity70 , 6 points ) 3			0
@entity12 ( @entity65 , @entity69 , @entity72 , 3 points ) 4			0
@entity75 ( @entity74 , @entity66 , @entity72 , 1 point ) @entity75 results @entity78 : @entity51 0 - 0 @entity48 lost : @entity51 1 - 2 @entity12 lost : @entity51 1 - 2 @entity10 ' i did not expect @entity51 to be eliminated early in the tournament ; but as i always say : football is a box of surprises			1
in that same group , @entity48 are proving to be a great surprise in this tournament , ' he said			0
' @entity59 is not the main reason of the disappointing tournament for @entity51			0
you need all the players and the entire organisation to be at their best during the tournament to perform well			0
' an early elimination is always a good reason to review what went wrong and come back stronger			0
@entity51 can learn from today 's mistakes and bounce back at @entity99			1
' the 73 - year - old , a three - time @entity7 winner and @entity23 's leading goal - scorer of all - time with 77 strikes in 92 appearances , is enjoying the ongoing tournament on his home soil and is understandably desperate for his country to be crowned champions			1
time to learn : @entity0 thinks @entity59 can ' review what went wrong and come back stronger ' dejected : @entity51 were knocked out of the @entity7 in dismal fashion in a tough @entity49 5 - @entity111 ( @entity112 ) 4 - @entity113 ( @entity114 ) , @entity115 ( @entity116 ) , @entity117 ( @entity23 ) 3 - @entity118 ( @entity119 ) , @entity120 ( @entity121 ) , @entity122 ( @entity121 ) , @entity123 ( @entity124 ) , @entity125 ( @entity126 ) those in italic are out of the @entity7			1
' i 've loved the competition so far , ' he said			0
' the atmosphere here is fantastic			0
international fans are happy to be at the stadiums all over @entity23 and the tournament has offered great football so far			1
' my wish is that @entity23 wins			0
it would be very sad for us if we do n't win the competition			0
' and @entity0 singled out @entity117 for special praise			2
the @entity143 forward has been @entity23 's talisman in their group games , scoring four goals , and he fired home the deciding spot - kick to ensure the host nation edged @entity150 on penalties over the weekend			1
' i have been very happy for @entity117 so far in this tournament , ' @entity0 said			2
' he helped the team win some games by scoring goals			0
' during the penalty kicks against @entity150 , he showed a lot of confidence and experience for his first - ever @entity7			2
' @entity161 better than @entity0 poster - boy : @entity117 has proved worthy of being @entity23 's talisman so far and it has even impressed @entity0 @entity165 : @entity117 has ' helped the team win some games by scoring goals ' says @entity0 and has shown confidence @entity0 launches revolutionary shin guard technology at the @entity7 host city			1
