by @entity0 published : 15:01 est , 25 september 2013 updated : 15:01 est , 25 september 2013 @entity1 today won a permanent ban on @entity3 selling t - shirts using her image - and an order that sir @entity8 ’s high street fashion chain must pay her estimated legal costs of almost £ 1million			1
@entity3 owners @entity12 were ordered by mr @entity13 at the @entity14 to pay £ 200,000 of this within 14 days , even though he found the size of her bill ‘ startling ’ and ‘ somewhat surprising ’			1
the @entity19 judge ruled in july that fans of the 25 - year - old singer from @entity22 , who was not in court , might have been deceived into thinking that she had endorsed the t - shirt			1
victory : @entity1 ( left ) won a permanent ban on @entity3 selling t - shirts using her image - and an order that sir @entity8 ’s ( right ) high street fashion chain pay her estimated legal costs of almost £ 1million @entity3 had sold the garment - which bore an image of her taken from a photograph - between march and august 2012			1
the judge said sale of the t - shirt without her permission was ‘ passing off ’			2
today , in the latest hearing , mr @entity13 ruled that it was ‘ right and fair ’ that ‘ style icon ’ @entity1 should be granted an injunction to prevent any future similar wrong use of the ' unflattering ' image			0
controversial : @entity3 had sold the garment - which bore an image of her taken from a photograph - between march and august 2012 he said @entity3 could appeal to the @entity50 against his ruling			0
but if his decision is upheld , he will then assess the amount of damages due to the singer - and how much is due in legal costs			0
the judge said @entity1 's lawyers gave an estimated legal bill of £ 919,000 - ‘ figures i find startling ’			2
he said he could not safely use those figures to decide what interim payment should be made today to @entity1 pending a full damages assessment			0
he eventually settled on a ‘ reasonable ’ £ 200,000			0
@entity1 also sought the return of any unsold t - shirts , but the court in @entity68 heard that all 12,000 had been sold - and only five were left and kept for the legal action			2
the judge had originally found that ‘ a substantial number of purchasers are likely to be deceived into buying the t - shirt because of false belief that it has been authorised by @entity1 herself			1
’ given her current tie - up with high street rivals @entity77 , the judge ruled that the @entity3 t - shirt would be damaging to the style icon 's goodwill and a loss to her merchandising business			2
‘ it also represents a loss of control over her reputation in the fashion sphere , ’ ruled the judge			0
the judge said it was ‘ right and fair ’ to grant her a permanent injunction after being told that @entity3 had failed to promise not to use her image on t - shirts in the future			1
nobody at @entity12 or @entity3 was available for comment when contacted by @entity98 tonight .			0

@entity3 owners @entity12 ordered to pay £ 200,000 within 14 days
