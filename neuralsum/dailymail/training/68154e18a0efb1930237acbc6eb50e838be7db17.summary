scientists have revealed the first ever @entity2 map of bizarre astronomical phenomenon that has baffled scientists for nearly a century			1
the new map could help scientists explain what makes up the material that creates ' diffuse interstellar bands ' or @entity9			1
these are dark lines in space that hide in the light			1
scientists have known they exist since 1922 , but they still do n't know much about them			2
these maps show the amount of light absorbed by the @entity21 ( left ) and dust ( right )			0
@entity23 shows more absorbed light than blue			0
top maps are for northern @entity28 hemisphere and bottom for southern @entity28 hemisphere scientists believe cracking the mystery surrounding @entity9 could arm them with valuable information on how stars and galaxies are created			1
to create the map , scientists focused on the single @entity37 , one of over 400 absorption lines , with the goal of narrowing down its source			1
' @entity45 does not seem special compared to other @entity9 , ' lead author @entity42 , of the @entity43 in @entity44 , told @entity46			2
but , as a spectral feature often used to measure stellar motion , it is ' the most observed @entity21			0
' dibs are absorption lines that appear throughout the electromagnetic spectrum			0
they are caused by the absorption of light by matter in space			2
four hundred dibs have been seen - in ultraviolet , visible and infrared wavelengths - throughout space			0
researchers have speculated that the absorption of starlight that creates these dark bands points to the presence of unusually large complex molecules , but proof of this has remained elusive			1
' diffuse interstellar bands ' or @entity9 are dark lines in space that hide in the light			1
a student who photographed the light from distant stars discovered these bands in 1922			1
analysing rainbow - colour bands of starlight that have passed through space gives astronomers important information about the make - up of the space materials that the light has encountered			1
but in 1922 , the student 's photographs yielded some dark lines indicating that some starlight was ' missing '' and that something in the interstellar medium between @entity89 and the star was absorbing the light			1
since then , scientists have identified more than 400 of these diffuse interstellar bands , but the materials that cause the bands to appear and their precise location have remained a mystery			1
researchers have speculated that the absorption of starlight that creates these dark bands points to the presence of unusually large complex molecules , but proof of this has remained elusive			1
the nature of this puzzling material is important to astronomers because it could provide clues about the physical conditions and chemistry of these regions between stars			2
such details serve as critical components in theories as to how stars and galaxies formed			0
atoms in molecules give off light when their electrons change from one orbit to another			0
when the atoms crowd close to each other , one atom interferes with the spectrum of another			0
but as yet , nobody has found which molecules and atoms exactly correspond to the @entity127			0
the nature of this puzzling material is important to astronomers because it could provide clues about the physical conditions and chemistry of these regions between stars			2
in order to investigate @entity37 , astronomers used the @entity134 ( @entity134 ) survey of stars in the @entity28			1
rave has the spectra of almost half a million stars across the galaxy , all located in the southern sky			0
the large size of the sample allowed mapmakers to determine the distances of the material that causes the @entity9 , and how the material is distributed throughout space			1
the resulting maps showed the intriguing result that the complex molecules thought to be responsible for the @entity127 are distributed differently than another known component of the interstellar medium - the solid particles known as dust			2
future studies can use the techniques outlined in the new paper to assemble other maps that should further solve the mysteries surrounding where dibs are located , and what materials cause them			0
' to figure out what something is , you first have to figure out where it is , and that is what this paper does , ' said professor @entity170 , who is a professor of physics and astronomy at the @entity173 in @entity174			0
' larger surveys will provide more details in the future			0
this paper has demonstrated how to do that			0
' the nature of this puzzling material is important to astronomers because it could provide clues about the physical conditions and chemistry of these regions between stars			2
such details serve as critical components in theories as to how stars ( pictured ) and galaxies formed			0

@entity193 could help scientists explain origin of diffuse interstellar bands ( @entity127 )
these dark lines in space hide in the light , and were discovered in 1922
the map calculates the distances of the material that causes the @entity9
this could help astronomers explain exactly what causes dark bands
scientists believe cracking the mystery surrounding @entity9 could arm them with valuable information on how stars and the @entity28 were created
