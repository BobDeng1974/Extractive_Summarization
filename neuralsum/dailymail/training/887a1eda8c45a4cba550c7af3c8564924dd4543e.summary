shamed designer @entity0 , who was sacked by @entity1 in 2011 for a series of racist and anti-semitic offences , has been hired as creative director of @entity7 brand @entity5			1
the @entity9 designer , 53 , was asked to leave his job after a damning video emerged of him telling a woman whom he thought was @entity15 that he ' loves @entity16 ' and that her parents should have been ' gassed '			1
he then allegedly ranted to an @entity20 man sitting with her : ' * * * * ing @entity20 b * * * * * * , i 'm going to kill you			1
' two other women also complained to police about suffering anti-semitic abuse at the hands of the designer			1
at the time the @entity44 - winning actress said : ' in light of this video , and as an individual who is proud to be @entity15 , i will not be associated with mr @entity0 in any way			2
' i hope at the very least these terrible comments remind us to reflect and act upon combating these still - existing prejudices that are the opposite of all that is beautiful			0
' @entity1 owners @entity55 cited a zero - tolerance policy on racism and anti-semitism and immediately gave the designer his marching orders			1
he was later charged in court and given a suspended sentence			2

his brand 's products did not carry the @entity7 fashion house 's name , but visible white stitches instead as a signature			1
