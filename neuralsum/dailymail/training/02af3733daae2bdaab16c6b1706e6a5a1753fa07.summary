hatred : riot police set of tear gas to subdue the crowds outside the funeral for former ss officer @entity4 in @entity34 , a suburb of @entity35 justice served : the former @entity22 captain at his 1996 conviction ' the best thing would be to send the body back to @entity9 for it to be incinerated , ' @entity11 said			1
' that would be the most efficient way to leave no trace of a @entity6 criminal like @entity4 , ' he said			2
' @entity46 's body was also burnt and that was the best solution because it allowed the destruction of everything @entity49 represented , ' he said			0
@entity11 , who heads the @entity13 @entity6 - hunting organisation , has called for @entity4 to be incinerated in @entity9 @entity4 's lawyer had initially said that the former @entity22 officer could be buried in @entity53 , where he lived after the @entity26			1
but @entity53 said it would not accept his remains			2

however he served that sentence under house arrest at the @entity35 home of his lawyer , @entity76			1
@entity77 announced the death and released a final interview conducted with @entity4 in july during which the @entity9 denied that @entity80 gassed @entity13 during the @entity28 and accused the @entity81 of having fabricated the crimes to minimize the @entity84 ' own abuses during the war			2
@entity4 was tried and convicted for his role in the 1944 massacre of 335 civilians by @entity6 forces at the @entity89 outside @entity35			1
a row has raged for days over the officer 's last burial place after because authorities fear the grave could become a site of pilgrimage for his neo-nazi fanbase fascist followers : @entity8 king @entity46 , ( right ) @entity46 ( centre ) and @entity100 ( left ) the massacre was carried out in retaliation for an attack by resistance fighters that killed 33 members of a @entity6 military police unit a day earlier			1
@entity4 admitted shooting two people and rounding up victims , but insisted he was only following orders			2
he long felt like he had been scapegoated , since many other @entity9 who had participated in the massacre were n't convicted , another lawyer , @entity110 , told @entity112			2
death : @entity4 , who carried out one of @entity8 's worst massacres , died today aged 100 outrage : in the lead up to his birthday @entity13 groups called for celebrations to be banned ' the dignity with which he withstood his persecution made him an example of courage , coherence and loyalty , ' @entity76 said in the statement			1
the @entity69 massacre was a mass execution carried out on 24 march 1944 by @entity9 occupation troops during the @entity26 after an attack conducted the previous day in central @entity35 against the @entity131			0
the massacre was perpetrated in what was then a little - frequented rural suburb of the city , inside the tunnels of the disused quarries of pozzolana , near the @entity139			0
by mistake , 335 @entity8 prisoners were taken , five more than the 330 called for			1
led by @entity22 officers @entity4 and @entity143 , they were transported to the @entity69 caves in truckloads and shot in groups of five			1
many of the @entity9 officers had never killed before , so @entity149 ordered several cases of cognac to calm their nerves			0
many civilians were forced to kneel down over the bodies of those who had been killed before them			0
during the day of killing , @entity22 officers became drunk and there were reports of some victims ' heads being blown off while others were not immediately killed			0
one prisoner , a deserter from the @entity165 army was allowed to live ; the five surplus prisoners were murdered to prevent news of the location of the massacre			0
one officer , who refused to shoot , was personally dragged to the execution site by @entity4 , who forced him to kill his victim			0
the officers then blew up the entrance to the caves to seal off the evidence			0
the @entity89 site ( @entity69 ) , declared a @entity179 and @entity180 , is open to visitors			0
@entity4 had escaped in 1946 from a @entity61 prison camp in @entity183 , a resort town on @entity8 's @entity185 coast , and had lived in @entity53 for nearly 50 years before a @entity187 television programme reported that he was living freely in the country			1
that started a lengthy extradition process that ended with him boarding a plane in @entity53 on nov. 20 , 1995 , the 50th anniversary of the start of the @entity194 , to stand trial in @entity8			1
the country 's highest appeals court upheld his conviction and life sentence in 1998			2

mr @entity11 , the @entity2 's chief @entity6 hunter who just this year launched a new push to search for unpunished war criminals , said @entity4 's case proves it is never too late to seek justice			0
' @entity4 's death at the age of 100 should be a powerful reminder that some of the worst perpetrators of the crimes of the @entity28 live to a healthy old age and that a person 's chronological age should never prevent them from being held accountable for their crimes , if they are healthy enough to be brought to justice , ' he said in a telephone interview from @entity223			2
' @entity4 was a classic example of a totally unrepentant @entity6 war criminal			0
' in his final interview , @entity4 denied that gas chambers were used in @entity6 concentration camps and that generations have been ' brainwashed ' into believing that they were			0
