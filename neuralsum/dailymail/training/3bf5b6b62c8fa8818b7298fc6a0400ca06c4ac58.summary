by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 21:11 est , 31 december 2013 @entity3 : 21:36 est , 31 december 2013 it 's a story that 's sure to make you second - guess ever using second - hand furniture again			0
a woman who picked up a couch off the street in @entity10 , @entity11 , was shocked to discover the furniture was home to a boa constrictor two months after she had been using it every day			1
@entity16 told @entity17 on tuesday that she and her boyfriend had given the couch a good once - over before bringing it home , never suspecting that a snake lived inside			1
it had a ' for free ' sign on it outside someone 's house and was in pretty good condition			1
@entity16 , sitting on the second - hand couch that she discovered a boa constrictor in , has now put the lounge out front of her house with ' do n't pick up ' scrawled across it in marker @entity16 shows a video of her upturned couch and the snake that was living inside of it for two months without her realizing ' we smelled it and everything -- it looked ok , ' she said			1
' we peeled off the cushions , cleaned it up , never saw anything			0
' but over the weekend the four - foot creature slithered out from the lounge			0
' it 's been living in the couch for like two months in my bedroom and i had no idea and it looks pretty big , ' @entity53 said			2
she added that the snake was n’t too menacing , and instead appeared ' lethargic ' and likely had n’t eaten in a long time			0
' it did n't really react or hiss , but when we poked it with a coat hanger it coiled up a little bit , so at that point we flipped the couch over , ' she said			2
scary : @entity16 could not believe there had been a snake inside her couch for so long ' it was quite cold in the room , there was no food for the snake and i think it came out of the couch because it was dying			1
' indeed , the spooky reptile died before @entity53 could take it to an animal rehabilitator			2
she buried it under a tree and put the couch back on the street — with “ @entity86 ” scrawled across it			0
the creepy discovery was still sinking in			0
the couch was often used by @entity16 - who said she read ' a few novels ' on it - and her dog			1
luckily the snake did not harm either of them ' sometimes my dog would sit up there ! i would drink a cup of coffee , check emails - i read a few novels on that couch , ' she said			1
' my room almost feels a little empty now			0
it 's been really sad actually to realize all this time i was in proximity to that animal ( that ) was probably suffering			0

@entity16 and her boyfriend found a couch outside a house with a ' free ' sign on it near their home in @entity10 , @entity11
she used it for two months to read books , check emails , and her dog *regularly* sat on it
this week she was shocked when a boa constrictor came slithering out
the animal was not *aggressive* and died , likely from *starvation* , *shortly* after getting out of the couch
