‘ i just feel like their dangerous and offensive , ’ protest organiser @entity49 told @entity50			0
‘ they ’re dangerous because some women find it very difficult to breastfeed , especially in public and i think a comment like that can shame them into not doing it in public and feel like it is not supported by people			2
