the majority of heatwaves and almost a fifth of extreme rain storms can be blamed on human activity , a new study has warned			1
researchers say that three quarters of extreme hot weather and 18 per cent of heavy precipitation is being driven by global warming that has occurred due to man - made emissions			1
they warn that as climate change pushes global temperatures higher over the coming decades , humans will become responsible for 40 per cent of extreme rainfall events			1
researchers say 75 % of extreme hot weather and 18 % of heavy precipitation is being driven by global warming as a result of man - made emissions			1
they warn that as climate change pushes global temperatures higher , humans will be responsible for 40 % of extreme rainfall events ( floods in @entity24 in 2014 are shown ) the scientists claim it is the rarest and most destructive events that seem to be the most responsive to human influence			1
dr @entity29 , from the institute for atmospheric and climate science at the @entity32 who led the study , said : ' climate change includes not only changes in mean climate but also in weather extremes			1
global temperatures were the highest since records began in 1880 , according to scientists			1
temperatures across the world averaged 0.8 ° @entity42 ) above 20th century averages - making 2014 the warmest year in records dating back 134 years			0
the @entity45 has already announced that 2014 was the hottest year for the @entity46 in records dating back to 1910			0
scientists have also warned that 2015 could be warmer still			0
earlier this month they revealed that the @entity49 experienced its hottest month of march since record - keeping began in 1880			0
the first three months of 2015 have all set new high temperature marks			0
last month 's average temperature soared to @entity53 ( 13.6 ° c ) , which is 1.5 ° f ( 0.85 ° c ) above the average for the 20th century			0
also of concern was the finding that @entity59 sea ice was the lowest on record for march			0
much of the most abnormal heat has been in the @entity62 and places near it			0
seven western @entity65 states set records for their hottest first three months of the year , while @entity67 and @entity68 set records for the coldest start of a year			0
@entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 have also all been warmer than normal			0
@entity75 blames the record heat on a combination of @entity78 , a blob of record hot water in the @entity81 and human - caused climate change			2
' with every degree of warming it is the rarest and the most extreme events and thereby the ones with typically the highest socio - economic impacts for which the largest fraction is due to human - induced greenhouse gas emissions			1
' we show that at the present - day warming of 0.85 ° c about 18 per cent of the moderate daily precipitation extremes over land are attributable to the observed temperature increase since pre-industrial times , which in turn primarily results from human influence			2
' for 2 ° c of warming the fraction of precipitation extremes attributable to human influence rises to about 40 per cent			0
' likewise , today about 75 per cent of the moderate daily hot extremes over land are attributable to warming			0
' the researchers , whose work is published in the journal @entity105 , examined the probability that heatwaves and heavy rainfall events could be attributed to humans using 25 climate models			1
the models examined the weather between 1901 and 2005 using historical simulations			0
they analysed daily temperatures and daily rainfall totals from climate models and looked for events that would be expected to occur once in 1,000 days in an unperturbed climate - referred to as moderate daily extremes			2
they then used the models to look at predictions of extreme weather between 2006 and 2100 under an emissions scenario that is expected to lead to 2 ° c of warming around the world			1
while attributing individual extreme weather events such as hurricanes , floods and heatwaves to climate change is notoriously difficult , climate scientists have predicted they will become more common as the world warms			1
dr @entity133 and his colleague professor @entity134 , also based at the @entity32 , said taking a more global perspective made it easier to examine the role that human activity was having on such events			1
they say their research demonstrated a strong signal for human influence in the extreme weather that is having impacts around the world today			1
they found that the longer the period of the event - such as a heatwave , the greater the fraction is attributable to global warming			2
the graphic above shows where the change in the probability of heavy precipitation and heatwaves compared to the pre-industrial period			2
if global temperatures increase as predicted , as a result of climate change , this becomes more pronounced , explained the researchers @entity163 is in the grip of its worst drought on record , causing lake beds to dry up ( as above )			1
around three quarters of heatwaves can now be attributed to human activity and it is likely to worsen as the climate warms dr @entity133 said : ' a warmer and moister atmosphere does clearly favour more frequent hot and wet extremes			1
' professor @entity176 , a scientist at the @entity45 's @entity177 in the @entity46 , pointed to the extreme weather that has happened in the past year - one of the warmest on record			1
he said @entity180 was hit by flooding in 2014 , @entity74 suffered heatwaves and @entity183 was battered by downpours			0
@entity163 , for example , is in the grip of one of the most severe droughts on record			0
he added that human - caused climate change had ' loaded the dice ' in favour of heatwaves like the one that hit @entity72 in 2003 and the flooding that hit the @entity46 in autumn 2000			1
the models examined weather between 1901 and 2005 using historical simulations			0
they analysed daily temperatures and daily rainfall totals from climate models and looked for events that would be expected to occur once in 1,000 days in an unperturbed climate			2
extreme rainfall is pictured in @entity208 writing in the journal , professor @entity209 said : ' as each year goes by , evidence continues to accumulate that our climate is changing and that human influence plays a dominant role in observed warming			2
' the prevalence of extremely hot temperatures is expected to increase with warming and more moisture in the atmosphere leads to a tendency towards more extreme rainfall events , changes that have been detected in the observational record			2
' but what has been lacking up to now is a robust calculation of how much more likely extreme temperatures and rainfall have become worldwide			0
' the idea that in a two - degree world almost half of heavy rainfall events would not have occurred were it not for climate change is a sobering thought for policymakers seeking to mitigate and adapt to climate change			0

scientists at the @entity32 in @entity240 modelled the probability of extreme weather events being caused by human activity
they found humans are to blame for the worst heatwaves and floods today
conclusion was made by comparing levels pre and post industrial times
experts warn storms will grow more common as global temperatures rise
