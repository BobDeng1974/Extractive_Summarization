@entity0 will not have to look too far in his search for a starting xi that copes with the absence of @entity4 – the team he put out on saturday without the @entity6 won 5 - 0 and gave @entity8 's best performance of the season			1
@entity4 's injury now looks certain to rule him out of this weekend 's @entity11 as well as wednesday night 's @entity13 group b game at @entity14			2
but with £ 30million @entity19 under 21 @entity15 and former @entity18 target @entity16 to come in there is no real concern that @entity8 , who will also be without central defender @entity23 , will be weakened			0
some @entity8 watchers even belive that for all of @entity4 and @entity26 's brilliance , against better sides who keep the ball well , @entity8 are better with only one of their powerful sprint forwards in the team			1
@entity4 will miss @entity8 's game with @entity34 after injuring a muscle in his buttocks former @entity37 midfielder @entity16 ( right ) , pictured in action against @entity39 , looks set to replace @entity4 at @entity14 @entity4 ( left ) was left on the bench as @entity16 ( right ) and @entity8 thrashed @entity39 5 - 0 on saturday @entity8 's probable xi against @entity34 last season in the @entity42 final @entity26 was missing and @entity0 played a 4 - 4 - 2 with @entity4 and @entity43 up front and it was enough to defeat @entity46 in what was the first of two trophies @entity8 won			1
on wednesday night he will repeat that formula with @entity43 pairing up with @entity26 and @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity16 making up a midfield four			2
one of @entity0 's challenges when he arrived was to make @entity8 play a little more like @entity46 – with that midfield he can send out a team capable of passing any rival into submission			2
@entity16 has had a difficult time since signing a year ago and soon being overtaken by @entity4 but now is his chance			0
' what we have lost in gallop , we have gained in control ' said one @entity8 commentator on tuesday underlining the sense that @entity16 will keep the ball better than @entity4 making up for the @entity6 's more explosive qualities			1
@entity4 's injury to the pyramidalis muscle located deep with in the @entity73 muscle group could be related to a long term herniated spinal disc problem discovered during his @entity8 medical according to @entity78 specialist @entity77			0
he said : ' it could be related because a player can strain other areas in the lumbar region an attempt to over compensate for the hernia , ' he said			0
disc hernias are not uncommon in sportsman and @entity4 finished last season strongly scoring in the @entity13 final but he has played 1,319 minutes already so far this season , including 180 minutes for @entity90			0
he could now miss up to five games in a two - week recovery period			0
@entity26 looks set to start as a striker alongside @entity43 at @entity14 on wednesday @entity96 , pictured in action against @entity95 , will take @entity23 ' place against @entity34 @entity98 ; @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity96 , @entity101 ; @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity16 ; @entity26 , @entity43 .			1

@entity4 has been ruled out after suffering a buttock muscle injury
the @entity6 is set to be replaced by @entity16 in @entity8 's starting xi
@entity16 does *n't* offer the same pace as @entity4 but he will help @entity0 's side control the ball
@entity8 take on @entity34 at @entity14 on wednesday evening
@entity26 will start as a striker alongside @entity43
