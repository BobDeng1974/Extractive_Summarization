all three of the main parties ’ education spokesmen revealed they would have no problem with the next education secretary sending their children to private school			1
the outbreak of honesty among politicians came when the @entity11 ’s @entity10 presenter @entity9 , asked if it would be a ‘ acceptable for an education secretary to send their children to a private school ’			1
@entity15 , @entity16 ’s shadow education secretary answered first and said : ‘ yes			1
he also confirmed @entity16 could fire the thousands of ‘ unqualified ’ teachers across the state sector			2
all three of the main parties ’ education spokesmen - pictured on the @entity11 's @entity10 show today - revealed they would have no problem with the next education secretary sending their children to private school two of his three children go to a state primary school in north @entity27 , with the third expected to go to the same school			1
but he has not ruled out switching them to independent schools			0
in contrast , @entity16 leader @entity31 refused to publicly support @entity16 ’s deputy @entity33 , @entity34 , when he chose to send his son to a private school in @entity37			1
privately - educated schools minister @entity38 – who has no children - immediately said ‘ yes ’ when asked whether a future education secretary should be able to send their children private			1
and education secretary , @entity42 , who was privately educated but sends her son to a state primary , said : ‘ yes , you do what ’s right for the child			1
’ @entity50 ’s @entity49 and the @entity52 ’s @entity51 also agreed that there was no problem with a future education secretary sending their children private – although mr @entity49 added it would be an ‘ indictment ’ of the quality of state schools			1
just seven per cent of children in the @entity61 are privately educated			0
@entity50 has pledged to bring back grammar schools by converting some existing comprehensives but mrs @entity64 said it would be a ‘ step backwards ’ and the plan ‘ does not respect the outstanding schools that we see up and down the country ’			0
@entity15 , @entity16 ’s shadow education secretary , was asked if it was acceptable for an @entity42 to send their child private			1
he said : ‘ yes			0
in certain circumstances ’ the rare frankness about whether they would send their children private is in stark contrast to the controversy sparked by @entity16 left - winger @entity77 , who sent her son to the exclusive fee - paying @entity79 school			1
miss @entity77 had previously criticised @entity80 , now @entity16 ’s deputy leader , for sending her children to a selective grammar school			1
while many politicians on the @entity85 have avoided paying to send their children to get the best education , they have managed to get them into elite taxpayer - funded schools			2
both @entity88 – who converted to @entity89 after standing down – and atheist @entity90 , bagged places at leading @entity92 for their children			0
both men are married to @entity95			0
put to the three main party spokesmen that they were all privately educated and @entity98 graduates , mr @entity15 agreed that the ‘ circle is tightening ’ on top professions			2
mr @entity15 also signalled @entity16 would sack all the ‘ unqualified ’ teachers by the end of their first term in government if they had not signed up to training			2
labour leader @entity31 , who stopped for a selfie with passers by at @entity109 railway station today , has vowed to halt the @entity111 's education reforms the prime minister , campaigning with supporters in @entity113 today , has vowed to turn all failing schools into academies some 17,000 teachers do not have ‘ @entity118 ’ after @entity119 , the previous @entity121 education secretary , waived the rules to attract more professionals and subject experts into schools			1
but mr @entity15 said @entity16 would be prepared to fire them			2
‘ at the end of a parliament , if you ’re not qualified or working towards qualified teacher status , we do n’t think that you ’ve shown the enthusiasm and the respect to your pupils ...			0
you do n’t deserve to be in the classroom … we need high quality teaching			0
” he said firing them would be ‘ a sign of the respect we attach to teachers ’			0
‘ we think it is a demanding , fulfilling profession			0
we do n’t think anyone can turn up to be a teacher			0
you need training , ’ he said			0
mr @entity15 himself is technically unqualified but occasionally teaches history in @entity27 schools and university			0
he did not reveal if he had plans to fire himself should @entity16 win the election .			2

main parties ' school spokesmen backed right to *opt* out of state education
they were asked if an @entity42 could choose private school
@entity16 ’s shadow education secretary said : ' yes . in certain circumstances '
education secretary @entity42 agreed , as did the @entity162 @entity38
