an architect has thought outside the box to house the homeless - by designing them shelters inside billboards which pay for themselves through advertising revenue			2
@entity7 @entity6 came up with the idea for the small roadside accommodation , complete with giant images and neon lights on the outside , for a programme called @entity14			1
mr @entity6 , and fellow designers @entity15 and @entity17 , are seeking to raise £ 41,000 on @entity18 to fund the first prototype home and test out their novel idea			1
mr @entity6 said : ' through our campaign at @entity18 people from all around the world can also contribute to the realization of @entity14			2
' it is based on the same principle as when you give a piece of food or a coin to people without a home			0
' so far the team has yet to raise the bulk of the funds for their novel approach in getting the homeless a roof over their head , but it 's early days and the online fundraiser still has 41 days left			2
and although they plan to start off their project in their home country of @entity7 , mr @entity6 believes their plan in thinking outside the box ' has the potential to go global			1
the designers say the revenue from the advertising on the outside would cover all the maintenance costs mr @entity6 and his team are looking to raise £ 41,000 on @entity18 to build their first prototype shelter ' when everyone who is interested in our idea will give us £ 1 we will be closer to help people without a home and soon @entity82 can spread into other countries			1
' now is the best time to make big changes and everyone can participate			0
' the trio of designers want to give the homeless more than just a roof and four walls , however , and the living spaces would be smart and modern on the inside complete with plenty of home comforts			0
the billboard homes would maximise all the space inside the wooden - built shelters the designers planned mr @entity6 and his designers are asking that each person give just £ 1 each to turn their dream into a reality and to pay for the day - to - day maintenance costs and utility bills , the rectangular billboard homes would cover themselves through money brought in from renting the outside walls to advertisers			0
mr @entity6 said : ' if we take the electricity cost needed for the billboard to keep it lit at night and we try to optimize it by x % , we find this saved energy could fully cover all interior usage needs			0
' the novel billboard homes would be built with wooden joists set into a concrete base			0
for now , mr @entity6 and his team are hoping the public will pitch in for their @entity18 campaign in their goal to raise £ 41,000 needed to get the novel shelter to the homeless off the ground .			1
