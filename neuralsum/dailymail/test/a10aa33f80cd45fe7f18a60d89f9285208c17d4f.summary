a writer has revealed why she stopped washing her hair six years ago after embarking on a quest to try and control her greasy , limp locks - by avoiding shampoo			1
@entity6 @entity5 was inspired to give up using products on her hair after she ran into an old friend whose once dry , frizzy locks were smooth and shiny			1
when @entity5 asked for her secret , her friend explained that she had simply stopped shampooing , opting to partake in the apparently - popular ' no poo ' movement , which @entity5 had never heard of until that moment			1
' i was n’t in love with it , and i just did n’t really know what to do , ' she told @entity20			0
' i wanted to try my friend ’s trick and stop shampooing			0
@entity5 recalled that during those first few weeks her hair was the ' greasiest ' it had ever been			2
' i was so embarrassed that i did n’t want to show my head to anyone , ' she explained			0
despite the fact that she ' almost cracked ' and went back to shampoo , she forged on with her mission			0
after vacation she started wrapping her hair with headbands every day			0
when she showered she would wet her hair and scrub her scalp with her fingers			0
and even though her boyfriend was critical of the idea , @entity5 explained that , by this point , she ' felt committed ' to her cause			2
new woman : the writer from @entity6 said her hair is now silkier and ' totally frizz - free ' since she gave up using shampoo it took six weeks for her hair to feel somewhat normal again and then another six weeks of her hair looking ' so - so ' before the ' magic happened '			1
' i started to see what my natural hair was like when i was n’t constantly doing stuff to manipulate it , ' @entity5 explained			2
' it was silky and wavier and totally frizz - free			1
' the ' no poo ' movement has gained popularity over recent years because of celebrities such as @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 who have revealed that that they avoid washing their hair for days - and sometimes months - on end			1
because it is no longer considered a ludicrous concept , @entity5 said that she typically does n't have a problem sharing her hair secret , but she did note that sometimes she will come across someone who just does n't get it - including one hair stylist who did n't understand why she could n't shampoo her hair			1
@entity5 explained that her although her current regimen sounds like a ' beauty philosophy ' , she was really just experimenting to see what worked for her			2
' i do n’t think shampoo is evil or bad for your hair ... ' she said			0
' i still have good hair days and bad hair days , but overall , my hair looks and feels so much healthier			0

@entity5 , from @entity6 , gave up using hair products as a part of the ' no poo ' movement
the writer *battled* greasy hair and dandruff for nearly two months before locks became silkier and ' totally frizz - free '
