by @entity0 published : 16:32 est , 21 june 2012 updated : 01:51 est , 22 june 2012 mirren : what ... you want me to play the queen again ? @entity6 portrayed @entity7 for the second time on tuesday — at a reading of a new play that features her maj and some of the 12 prime ministers she ’s seen during her reign			1
but there were questions as to whether or not @entity15 would make the cut			0
‘ it was rather poignant , seeing @entity6 as her majesty again , ’ a friend who was at tuesday ’s private performance tells me			1
the monarch will be the only royal in the drama , called the audience			0
‘ it ’s about the personal , with the background of the political , ’ a confidential source tells me			0
@entity6 , who won a best actress @entity30 for her stunning portrait of @entity7 in @entity32 , did a reading of @entity35 ’s script — which is described as still a work in progress — along with several actors , playing the six or seven pms who will feature in the play			1
@entity35 , who also wrote the screenplay for @entity43 ’s 2006 film , has included @entity44 , who was there for the weekly audiences at the beginning of her reign ; @entity50 ; @entity51 ; @entity52 and @entity53			1
@entity54 and @entity55 are possibilities , too , although no one would go on the record about @entity15			0
‘ it focuses on the relationship one person has had , supposedly in private , with a succession of prime ministers , ’ another insider involved in the production tells me			0
‘ in the current draft there are six , could be seven , of her pms , but work continues on the play ’s text			2
‘ it ’s far from finished and @entity35 likes to keep writing till the last minute			1
the one constant is the @entity32			1
the others are her prime ministers , and they ’re moveable			0
’ reunited : @entity6 is teaming up again with @entity35 , who wrote the screenplay for the @entity30 - winning 2006 film @entity32 i understand that those who attended tuesday ’s reading in @entity80 found the play ‘ very touching , very funny and quite confessional ’			1
‘ @entity35 has done a lot of background research and spoken to lots of people , in the way he did for @entity32 and his tv films about @entity54 and @entity15			1
‘ there ’s stuff in it that people will know about , and some they wo n’t , ’ my source says , although they were quick to add that ‘ it ’s a play , not a documentary ’			2
‘ it ’s not taken from what people have actually said ; rather @entity35 has created a work about what they might have said			1
’ @entity102 , who is in negotiations to direct the @entity104 , was at the reading , too , along with producers and associates from the companies run by @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 ( who was one of the producers of @entity32 )			1
celebrated designer @entity113 is believed to be in negotiations to create the costumes and sets for the audience which , if all the various deals can be done , will be in the @entity119 next year			1
@entity120 : at a delicate stage where art thou ( to misquote the @entity125 ) stage version of @entity30 - winning film @entity120 ? to borrow another of @entity128 ’s favourite phrases , thereby hangs a tale			1
@entity131 there was talk that a theatre production of the movie — which won seven @entity30 including ones for stars @entity136 and @entity138 , writers @entity139 and @entity141 @entity142 and best film — was going to have a run in the @entity119			1
initially , @entity139 was going to re-write it for the stage , but he withdrew			0
so producers @entity147 , who heads @entity150 ’s theatrical division , and @entity151 contracted @entity153 writer @entity152			0
and all was well until a recent workshop of the script involving various actors and director @entity157 , who has won many plaudits for his work on @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 and current hit @entity163 ( he ’s working on a new show by @entity163 writer @entity166 )			2
@entity168 words were exchanged and @entity157 has now left the @entity120 production , so the search is on for a new director			0
but the play ’s the thing and i ’m sure all ’s well that ends well			2
we can but hope the show will be ready for next year , or 2014			0
image change : @entity180 with co-star @entity181 in @entity182 award - winning actress @entity180 , who won an @entity183 when she originated magical nanny @entity184 on stage , is casting aside that goody - two - shoes image to play a scarlet woman			1
@entity180 will star as @entity188 in a rare revival of @entity191 ’s 19th - century ‘ woman with a past ’ drama at the @entity193 in @entity194 , @entity195 , for a month from september 27			0
the play was about as dangerous as you could get in its day , as it told the tale of @entity199 , a woman who , as @entity180 puts it , ‘ led a courtesan - type life and then swapped that to become the wife of a very rich man ’			1
‘ it ’s almost the reverse of @entity206 , in that when she enters the high life , she has n’t learnt not to say outlandish things and she innocently insults people , ’ says @entity180 , who also played @entity203 in @entity205 ’s production of @entity206 in the @entity119			1
the play is also about @entity214 , she adds , in that @entity199 pays a price when a man from her past threatens to wreck her new life with her husband and step - daughter			2
for @entity180 it marks a return to the @entity224 stage after two years ( on and off ) playing @entity184 in the @entity150 - @entity225 show on @entity226			0
she took a break to appear opposite @entity181 in the film goddess , which was shot in @entity229			2
she and @entity181 attended a special screening of the picture during the @entity232 last month			0
@entity180 will leave her apartment in the trendy @entity235 district of @entity236 for rehearsals with @entity188 director @entity238 in late august			0
in between , she ’ll continue working with @entity239 at workshops for the rock star ’s musical @entity241 , which is set in @entity243			0
and she ’ll play @entity244 in @entity245 for six performances at the @entity247 in @entity248 , @entity249 , in early august			2
the @entity250 is jam - packed with amazing arts , but do see three short films commissioned by @entity253 and @entity254 : the @entity255 , by @entity256 ; @entity257 ’s a @entity258 ; and @entity260 ’s swimmer			0
also , @entity262 ’s splendid film of @entity263 , with an excellent @entity264			2
shot entirely on location , it ’s the first part of the @entity267 ( @entity268 , @entity269 1 & 2 , and @entity270 to follow ) made by the @entity253 , @entity271 and @entity272 .			0

@entity6 dons regal attire for reading of new play on the @entity119
the @entity104 was written by @entity35 , the man behind 2006 film @entity32 , which won the actress her @entity30
