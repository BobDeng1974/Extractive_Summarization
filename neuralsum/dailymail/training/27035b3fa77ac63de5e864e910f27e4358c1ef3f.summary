by @entity0 published : 13:09 est , 30 april 2012 updated : 07:07 est , 1 may 2012 he is already recognised as one of the greatest artists of the renaissance period			0
now a stunning new exhibition at @entity6 demonstrates how @entity7 was also one of the most ground - breaking anatomists of all time			1
indeed his findings dating from the late 1490s and early 1500s were so revolutionary that some could not be conclusively proved until the development of @entity16 ( @entity16 ) scanners in the 1980s , which use radio waves to take detailed pictures of the body			1
among the 24 sketches never before seen included a detailed study of the right ventricle and valves of the heart a closer examination of the right ventricle and tricuspid valve , left , and far right , @entity7 pens his analysis of the movement inside the heart @entity31 explores the vessels of the neck and shoulder , left , and right , the bones and muscles of the shoulder @entity7 's fascination with the human body began through his desire to be ' true to nature ' in his paintings and led him to embark on what can only be described as a campaign of dissection in hospitals and medical schools throughout @entity48			1
many of the corpses he worked on were the bodies of executed criminals or those who had no relatives to claim them for burial			0
he had hoped to publish his findings in a treatise on anatomy and had he done so , his discoveries would have transformed @entity61 knowledge on the subject			1
but on his death in 1519 , his notes and drawings remained hidden away amongst his mass of private papers and effectively lost to the world for 400 years			0
arguably his greatest investigations focus on the workings of the heart - and the artist came tantalisingly close to discovering the science behind the circulation of blood , a century before it was officially achieved			1
according to @entity77 curator @entity76 , @entity7 became fascinated with a swelling he discovered at the root of the aorta , just beneath the aortic valve			2
the brachial plexus , and umbilical vessels , left , and right , the veins of the pelvic and lumbar region the brachial plexus , left , and right , @entity7 explores the thetrachea , stomach and right vagus nerve @entity7 , right , also paid close attention to the abdomen , left , during his extensive analysis of the human anatomy in order to investigate this he injected melted wax into the heart of an ox in order to make a cast from inside the cavity			1
he then made a glass model from the cast which he pumped with water containing a suspension of grass seeds so that he could witness the ' turbulence ' that took place			0
from his research he deduced that this swelling was responsible for the closure of the aortic value after each beat of the heart - a theory which was not suggested again until 1912 and even then not conclusively confirmed until less than 30 years ago			0
another ground - breaking discovery came in the winter of 1508 - 1509 when @entity7 was present at the death of an old man			1
he wrote : ' and this old man , a few hours before his death , told me that he was over 100 years old , and that he felt nothing wrong with his body other than weakness ... and i dissected him to see the cause of so sweet a death			0
' @entity7 then goes on to provide the first ever description and diagnosis of coronary vascular occlusion - a partial or complete blockage of an artery to the heart - as well as arteriosclerosis , or a hardening of the arteries , and cirrhosis of the liver			1
the muscles of the trunk and leg , left , and right , the stomach and related structures the muscles of the legs , left , and right , the male and female reproductive systems , with a detailed breakdown of the individual parts for both men and women the muscles of the leg , right , and left , a close look at the individual nerves inside the leg other studies concentrate on muscle form and the body 's reproductive organs , particularly the formation of embryos , with astonishingly detailed drawings of babies still inside their mother 's bodies			1
one study illustrating every bone in the human body is accompanied by 240 individual drawings of astounding clarity and more than 13,000 words of notes - all in his famed ' mirror writing '			1
there has been much debate as to why @entity7 wrote backwards but most seem to think that it was down to a combination of him being left handed and dyslexic			2
writing in this manner enabled his hand to move quickly without smudging the ink			0
' to say that @entity7 was a man ahead of his time does n't even come close to describing his genius , ' explained mr @entity76			2
' his drawings are among the finest depictions of the human body ever created			1
had he published this work , he would now be known as one of the greatest scientists in history			0
' professor @entity193 , professor of clinical anatomy at @entity194 , added : ' for me as an anatomist , what @entity7 did was bring all his disciplines of architecture , geometry , engineering and combine it with an art expression that was quite unique			2
he put all these things together to try and explain not only how things looked but how things worked , and in that he was certainly unique			0
the cardiovascular system and principal organs of a woman , right , and left , extracts from @entity210 , @entity211 that @entity7 penned the contents of the topics to be investigated in the manuscript that has gone on display , and right , miscellaneous notes and anatomical sketches amongst his studies he also investigated the thoracic and abdominal cavities of an ox , left , and right , the blood supply of a foetal calf ' if you were to take ten specialists in the fields of which he worked , geometry , anatomy , physiology , engineering and architecture , i doubt if ten professors in those fields would have the knowledge base and talents that @entity7 had			1
' @entity7 , who died in 1519 , bequeathed all his notebooks and drawings to his young assistant , @entity241 , who , over the next 50 years , tried to make sense of his master 's daunting legacy			2
his son sold on many of the papers to the sculptor @entity248 who mounted the anatomical drawings into a large album which eventually made its way to @entity252 and is believed to have been bought by @entity253 it has been in the @entity77 , which is held in trust by @entity256 for the nation , since at least 1690			0
the collection boasts the largest compendium of @entity7 drawings in the world , some 600 in all , of which 268 are anatomical sketches			2
only one other of his anatomical drawings exists elsewhere today			0
of these , 87 are currently on display at @entity267 in @entity6 - many of which have never been publicly seen since they were drawn by the genius himself			0
@entity7 : @entity271 runs until october			0

one of @entity7 's more well - known anatomical drawings , ' @entity275 in the @entity276 ' the @entity7 : anatomist exhibition at @entity267 , @entity6 , runs until october @entity267 worker @entity278 adjusts ' @entity275 in the @entity276 ' , one of @entity7 's studies of the human body , during a preview of the upcoming exhibition the @entity77 boasts the largest compendium of @entity7 drawings in the world , some 600 in all , of which 268 are anatomical sketches			1
