the @entity1 ’s music radio services have been branded too white by the @entity3 ’s watchdog			0
a review of the six stations by the @entity6 has raised concerns that they are failing ethnic minority audiences			1
radio 2 was highlighted as having particular difficulties in attracting non-white listeners and the @entity6 has demanded the station urgently improve and report on progress in six months			0
the comments echo criticisms made in 2001 by then director - general @entity16 , who said the @entity1 was ‘ hideously white ’ and had race relations as poor as the @entity18			0
while yesterday ’s report accepts that the @entity1 has improved over recent years , it states that , ‘ like @entity1 television , @entity1 radio serves @entity24 audiences less well than it does white listeners			2
’ popular : @entity26 presents the radio 1 chart show which attracts 23 % of black , @entity29 and minority ethnic people aged 15 to 24 @entity24 stands for black , @entity29 and minority ethnic			1
it pointed to statistics that show only 34 percent of @entity24 adults tune in to one of the six music radio stations - @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity9 , @entity37 , 6 music and @entity39 – each week			1
this compares to 49 percent of all adults regardless of ethnicity			0
although the @entity24 figure is up from 29 percent five years ago , the @entity6 said the @entity1 must still improve further			2
it is a problem also faced by @entity1 television , with the latest figures revealing it reached 74 percent of @entity24 adults each week , compared with 86 percent of all adults			1
radio 2 has a target audience of the over 35s but even in among this group , it failed to attract ethnic minority listeners			1
it reaches an average of only 12 percent each week , compared to 35 percent for all adults			2
the @entity6 said : ‘ as @entity9 has a remit to serve a broad audience over the age of 35 , it should address this disparity			0
’ in the @entity6 ’s previous review of music radio , @entity35 was flagged up as of particular concern , reaching only 17 percent of @entity24 people aged between 15 and 24			1
struggling : @entity9 , which has presenters @entity65 ( left ) and @entity66 ( right ) , was highlighted as having particular difficulties in attracting non-white listeners by its own watchdog this time , the youth - oriented station has been praised for its progress , with the figure rising to 23 percent			1
however , this is still far lower than the 40 percent reach it has among young people nationwide regardless of ethnicity			0
this is not the first time in recent months that the @entity1 has been accused of failing ethnic minority au - diences			1
in a speech in december last year , the @entity3 ’s head of news @entity81 said his de-partment better serves ‘ rich , old , white people ’ than those from poorer backgrounds and ethnic minorities			0
yesterday ’s review announced that @entity35 was cutting back on its number of live recordings and its coverage of music festivals as part of a cost cutting drive			2
also revealing that there will be ‘ a small reduction ’ in drama on @entity37 , it praised the stations for being ‘ distinctive ’ and said they played a ‘ wider range ’ of music than their commercial rivals			0
@entity1 trustee @entity103 , who jointly led the review , said it made for ‘ positive reading ’			0
a @entity1 spokesman said : ‘ we aim to appeal to listeners from all backgrounds by offering a broad range of high - quality services and programming			0
' whilst listening to our music radio stations amongst @entity24 audiences has grown in recent years , we will continue work hard to make sure our stations represent and reach all audiences			1
