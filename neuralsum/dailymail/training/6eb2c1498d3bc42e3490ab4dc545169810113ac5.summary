by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 have experienced two very different pre-seasons over the last two summers			2
while @entity5 suffered defeats by poor opposition - losing 1 - 0 to the @entity8 , as well as being beated by @entity9 and going down 3 - 1 at home to @entity12 - new boss @entity11 has beaten some of the best teams in world football			1
unbeaten during the side 's tour of @entity19 with wins over @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 , the @entity16 put even bigger smiles on the faces of the @entity2 faithful as he masterminded a 3 - 1 victory over arch - rivals @entity28 to land the @entity29 in @entity30 on monday			1
anxious following the departure of sir @entity56 , the man who had delivered two decades of success to @entity58 , they were worried further as @entity5 lost his first game in charge of @entity2 to the @entity62 all - star xi in @entity63			1
the @entity64 went on to beat the @entity65 5 - 1 but then lost 3 - 2 to @entity66 and were also defeated by @entity12 during @entity68 's testimonial			1
the far from convincing pre-season set the tone for the campaign as @entity5 endured a disastrous time in the @entity58 hotseat			1
eventually finishing the season in seventh place having failed to qualify for @entity76 , @entity2 sacked @entity5 in april - two days after the @entity77 had lost to former club @entity78 - as the then defending champions suffered their worst season of the @entity82 era			1
@entity83 - 7 - 0 @entity23 - 3 - 2 @entity22 - 0 - 0 ( won 5 - 3 on penalties ) @entity21 - 3 - 1 @entity28 - 3 - 1 @entity85 ( @entity86 ) - aug 12 p 5 w 5 d 0 l 0 gf 16 ga 4 gd +12 @entity62 all - star xi - 0 - 1 @entity65 - 5 - 1 @entity66 - 2 - 3 @entity87 - 2 - 2 @entity88 - 5 - 2 @entity89 - 1 - 1 @entity12 - 1 - 3 p 7 w 2 d 2 l 3 gf 16 ga 13 @entity91 precedent ? @entity5 ' poor pre-season carried on into the new campaign as @entity2 failed to qualify for @entity76 while @entity5 suffered defeat in his first friendly in charge of @entity2 , @entity45 got off to the perfect possible start with a resounding 7 - 0 victory over @entity83			1
the @entity64 played scintilating football , new signing @entity100 gave a virtuoso performance , pulling the strings in midfield and the football world , prematurely , got excited about the new era of success @entity2 were about to embark on			2
it would be foolish to say @entity2 have returned to title - winning form off the back of five victories during a pre-season tour but the signs look positive			1
@entity114 man : @entity100 gave a man - of - the - match performance against @entity83 in @entity45 's first game it 's fair to say the side 's results this summer , along with the new 3 - 5 - 2 formation @entity45 has implemented with relative success , have given the @entity2 faithful plenty to be optimistic about for the upcoming campaign			1
the side under @entity45 has scored the same number of goals as @entity5 ' charges last term but are certainly much tighter at the back having conceded nine fewer			2
' @entity130 ' also seems to be getting the best out of the players who under - performed last term ; most notably @entity133			0
the wideman struggled under the previous stewardship but has shone , and scored , in @entity19			0
much improved : @entity133 has drawn plaudits during the tour of @entity19 having played poorly last term meanwhile , talisman @entity33 , who is likely to be given the captain 's armband , appears to be playing with a new lease of life and a smile on his face			2
@entity33 has said @entity45 has invigorated the @entity2 squad and given players a different way of looking at the game			1
@entity2 's @entity149 told the @entity150 : ‘ it 's been a good few weeks , we 've got a new manager who wants us to play a different style of football			0
we 've had to adapt			0
we 've had some good results against top opposition so we can be pleased			0
‘ i think the system suits the team , not only myself			0
the manager came in and had a look at the players we 've got			0
he 's done what he thinks is best suited for our team			0
‘ he 's a tough manager but he 's been great since he came in			0
he 's given us all a different way of looking at football , which we have n't had before			0
' @entity167 wants reinforcements new system : @entity33 says @entity11 has given players a different way of looking at football if pre-season is anything to go by , @entity2 will have no problems mounting a title challenge this season , with @entity85 at home the final game of the club 's preparations ahead of the next term			1
however , friendly records will mean nothing once the season is underway			0
having passed all of the tests so far , the real judgements will be made on @entity45 when @entity2 kick - off the new @entity82 season against @entity190 on august 16			2
only then will we know of the true impact the @entity16 has had on a squad which struggled so often under @entity5			2
judgement day : fans will see whether @entity45 's preparations have paid off when the new season kicks off			0

@entity11 has won every pre-season fixture while @entity5 managed just two victories
former @entity78 boss @entity5 took over from sir @entity56 but went on to endure disastrous spell at @entity58
@entity45 guided @entity46 to @entity48 semi-finals and is currently unbeaten with @entity2
@entity16 has implemented new 3 - 5 - 2 formation during tour of @entity19
@entity33 says @entity45 has made players see football differently
