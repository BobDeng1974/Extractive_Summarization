by @entity0 @entity3 prices have shot up 7.3 per cent since this time last year , new figures have revealed			1
the value of the average property - which has increased by 1.1 per cent in the last month alone - now stands at £ 175,546 , according to @entity7			1
the bank said that the pace of increase has picked up since december , when prices fell by 0.5 per cent			1
hike : today 's figures show that house prices continue to shoot up prices in the three months to january were 1.9 per cent higher than in the preceding quarter , which the bank 's monthly report said is in line with recent increases			1
the steady increase in house prices comes as the government 's help to buy scheme has fuelled demand by allowing those with small deposits to join the property ladder			1
under the programme , the state will back loans made to buy homes worth up to £ 600,000 with just a 5 per cent deposit			1
however , critics have said that stoking the property market in this way could lead to a price crash by creating a housing bubble			2
business secretary @entity39 said in december that the @entity41 ' need to look again ' at the policy , which he said was ' conceived in very different circumstances ' to the growing housing market shown in figures today			1
dr @entity39 specifically expressed concern over the difference between the ' raging housing boom in @entity49 and the @entity50 ' which was not reflected elsewhere			0
he brought up a statement by credit rating agency @entity52 's which he said was ' expressing very serious worries ' , which @entity54 seemed to share			2
underlying trend : this map shows how house prices have changed across the @entity58 over the last quarter , increasing by 1.9 per cent on average			1
prices are 7.3 per cent higher than this time in 2013 however , @entity61 hit back at the criticism of the flagship scheme last month , pointing out that house prices are still far from their 2007 peak and that there was ' no evidence of a problem '			1
he said : ' where we are today , house prices are still way below the peak they reached in 2007			2
' forecasters do not think they will get back to the level before the crash even in 2019			0
so there is no evidence of a problem			0
' nationally , excluding @entity49 and the south - east , house prices are up just 3 % over the last year			2
' i think there are some people who are rather @entity49 - centric about this			0
this is about helping people to achieve the security and stability they want of owning a flat or a home of their own			0
' in response to today 's figures @entity91 , a housing economist for @entity7 , said the continued squeeze on household finances as wages fail to keep up with the pace of inflation is ' expected to remain a constraint on the rate of growth of house prices '			1
@entity7 said that despite people 's finances continuing to be constrained , the scarcity of homes will continue to push up prices			1
according to recent findings from the @entity112 , the increased number of owners looking to sell at the end of 2013 is still too few to meet surging demand			2
mr @entity91 continued : ' with the supply of properties being slow to respond to more buoyant market conditions , stronger demand has resulted in continued upward pressure on house prices			2
' demand has increased against a background of low interest rates and higher consumer confidence underpinned by signs that the economy is recovering and unemployment falling faster than expected			2
' @entity127 , chief executive of mortgage broker @entity128 , said : ' we are still very much in recovery mode and it 's unlikely that the @entity132 will risk raising interest rates too soon			0
' borrowers need to plan ahead , however , and ensure they can cope with rate rises when they do come			0
' mr @entity127 said estate agents and mortgage brokers have got off to ' an incredibly busy start ' in 2014			0
he said : ' many buyers view this as the year when they will finally get on the housing ladder , or move up it - as long as they can find the right property			0
