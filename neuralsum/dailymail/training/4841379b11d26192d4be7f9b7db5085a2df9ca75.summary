@entity0 might be out of @entity2 ’s path at the @entity3 , but there is still the player who — contrary to his wishes — is sometimes called @entity7 @entity7 is talented , has a playing style similar to the @entity9 , the same agent and , as a consequence , many of the same sponsors , so it is hardly surprising that he draws comparisons			1
now he stands in the way of @entity2 making his sixth consecutive quarter - final at @entity17 as they meet in the fourth round			1
@entity2 celebrates on his way to his third straight - sets win of the week in @entity17 in the third round @entity23 will take on @entity7 in the next round , the man who knocked him out of @entity26 last year in something of a surprise move , @entity2 ’s match against @entity7 has been given the prominence of the main night match , local time , on the @entity33			1
they were expected to have been on in the day , but instead will play around 9.30am @entity36 time on sunday @entity37 means that , strangely , neither @entity38 or @entity39 will have their fourth round matches on the @entity42 , despite huge interest in them here			2
meanwhile @entity45 will make his fourth consecutive appearance on the biggest show court			0
there seems to be a message to the two young @entity50 : do n’t get carried away with yourselves			0
every player has matches that they would like to forget , and from last year one that @entity2 does not recall with fondness is his lacklustre quarter - final defeat at @entity26 to @entity57			1
it was a curious performance that came as a shock because the @entity60 was in form , and to this day he does not really understand what happened			0
‘ i played great in the first week at @entity26			2
i was feeling really good , i was playing extremely well			0
i happened to play a bad match and that obviously can happen at any time in an individual sport , ’ said @entity2 , who fairly breezed through his third - round match with a 6 - 1 , 6 - 1 , 7 - 5 win over @entity66 ’s @entity65			1
@entity2 's groundstrokes were often sublime however and left @entity65 with little answer @entity2 was cheered on by usual colourful support on another warm day in @entity17 ‘ unfortunately for me it happened at @entity26 so it was disappointing but it did n’t take me long to get over , because i was playing extremely well and just had a bad day			1
‘ you ca n’t stop yourself playing a bad match			0
it happens three or four times a year probably to most of the players			0
‘ i do n’t expect that to happen on sunday , i feel good just now , i feel confident , i feel pretty calm and there ’s no reason why i should be concerned of that happening			0
’ one reason is that @entity2 feels more comfortable at this @entity84 than at any other outside @entity26			2
he has also beaten @entity7 in their one encounter since , at the indoor @entity87 in november , although the @entity88 had a distinctly end - of - season look about him			2
for his part , @entity7 does not think what occured at @entity26 will have much bearing : ‘ i ’m expecting a different @entity2 from that day			1
i think you hardly ever see top players looking flat early in the match like that ; i think it will be a different scenario			0

@entity0 is out of @entity2 's path in his @entity3 quest
he is set to play his @entity26 *conquerer* @entity7 in round four
@entity2 will be *hoping* to make his sixth straight quarter - final in @entity17
