@entity1 ' collapse had those inside @entity3 holding their collective breath , with players , officials and fans fearing the worst after the @entity11 striker 's episode			1
as play was about to resume following a fine , early @entity15 volley , hush fell upon the ground where three years ago @entity18 midfielder @entity17 suffered a cardiac arrest			1
there was a deathly silence as paramedics and medical staff tended to @entity1 , who left the @entity3 pitch on a stretcher and wearing an oxygen mask after several minutes of treatment			1
@entity1 lies face down on the pitch after collapsing during @entity11 's game with @entity30 medical staff attended to the @entity34 international for four minutes before he regained consciousness concerned @entity30 players look on as the @entity11 forward is attended to my medical staff fortunately , good news soon emanated from the @entity11 dressing room and , later in the evening , @entity1 himself said he was ' feeling well ' after fainting			1
it was the latest episode stemming from a long - standing fainting condition and one which left @entity45 , on the bench three years ago and watching from the stands on wednesday , worried a similar incident to @entity17 's was unfolding			1
' it went through everyone 's mind , ' the veteran @entity49 said			2
' anyone who was at that game probably thought the worst immediately			0
' it 's not normal for someone to be standing there and collapse and you know it 's going to be something serious			2
' but after a minute or so the word got back , so that 's why you did n't see the panic on the players ' faces because everyone knew he was all right			2
' it was something that had to be dealt with , of course , but it was nothing in the stratosphere of what went on with @entity17			2
' @entity1 , who has a history of blacking out , is taken off the field on a stretcher at @entity3 @entity30 midfielder @entity78 ( right ) holds his head in his hands as @entity1 is taken off on a stretcher @entity45 's comments were echoed by @entity30 winger @entity83			1
' it kind of brought your memory back to @entity17 , ' he said			1
' it did n't look good			0
' when ( @entity17 collapsed ) i was n't here			1
i was on loan at @entity90 but seeing what happened with @entity1 could have meant going down the same route			2
' thankfully he 's okay , hopefully he can make a speedy recovery			2
' as worrying as the incident was , play continued and soon after @entity97 drew parity for @entity11			1
players from both sides appear shocked as referee @entity101 prepares to restart the game on 17 march 2012 , @entity17 collapsed on the pitch at @entity3 during an @entity105 quarter - final match between @entity18 and @entity30			1
the former @entity107 midfielder suffered a cardiac arrest and received life - saving medical treatment from @entity30 staff and consultant cardiologist dr @entity110 , who was at the game as a fan , from the pitch			2
@entity17 was rushed to the nearby @entity115 , accompanied by then manager @entity116 and striker @entity117 , for emergency treatment while the game was abandoned			1
medical staff rush to @entity17 's aid after the midfielder suffered a cardiac arrest in 2012 @entity17 's heart was reported to have stopped for 78minutes while the former @entity90 player received numerous defibrillator shocks on the pitch and in the ambulance			1
despite fears that he would not survive , the 26 - year - old made a miraculous recovery before being discharged from hospital on april 16 - although he was forced to retire from professional football			0
@entity135 and @entity83 netted in the second half to give @entity30 a lead @entity138 chipped away at late on , yet @entity140 's side ran out 3 - 2 victors			1
it was an important result following their @entity144 and @entity145 disappointments , especially as defeat on wednesday would have seriously dented their top - four ambitions			0
' it was the perfect response , ' @entity83 said in a week they have lost big games against @entity152 and @entity153			0
' to lose a cup final and have to play a very good side three days later is always difficult , but we knew we had to go out there tonight and start fast right from the off			0
' we knew we had to get the crowd on our side and lift the doom and gloom from the weekend , and i think we did that			0
' we got the early goal and it set us on our way to a great win			0
' @entity135 wheels away in celebration after scoring against @entity11 on wednesday evening the result denied @entity11 a third straight @entity172 win , although midfielder @entity173 does not think the performance or result was impacted by the @entity1 incident			1
' i was obviously worried , ' he told @entity178			0
' when something like that happens , you 're obviously worried , but the medical staff say he is fine so hopefully it 's not too bad			0
' the guys said ' do n't worry about it , just keep your minds on the game , he is okay ' blah , blah , blah			0
' @entity189 ( @entity190 ) was just reassuring us saying do n't worry about it and we had to carry on like it had n't happened			0
' in the first half we did okay , we played some okay stuff but the second half was tough for us			0
' they overloaded certain areas and made space on the wings for the full - backs			0
' it was tough for us but we had to try and keep a good shape and a couple of mistakes cost us the game			0
