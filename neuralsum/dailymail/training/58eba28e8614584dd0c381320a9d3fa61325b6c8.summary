@entity0 is n’t the only firm looking to create phones that can be upgraded , rather than replaced			1
the @entity3 lets owners swap parts in and out of the handset either when they break , or when a better version of that particular module is released			1
the @entity10 firm behind the plans is currently testing prototypes of the device , and hopes to release the handsets by the second half of 2015			1
each @entity3 is based around three elements - the @entity24			1
the phone ’s lcd display , microphone , main buttons and speakers connect to the spine			1
its @entity31 contains the battery and so - called secondary electronics , while the brain is where the camera and processor is kept , alongside the main circuitry of the device			1
each of these three segments can be slid out of the core , and replaced with another			0
according to the developer kit , @entity45 phones will be able run on multiple batteries - when one battery dies , it can be detached and replaced with a full battery module			1
each phone will have a central ' spine ' and an endoskeleton - nicknamed ' endo ' - made of ribs that the individual modules will clip on to			2
there will be three different sized endos - including mini , medium and large - to rival the existing range of phones currently on the market , from compacts to phablets			2
larger phones will be able to accomodate either larger , or additional modules , than the mini will			0
@entity0 's kit describes various modules including batteries , @entity72 and @entity73 chips , cameras , speakers and more			1
in theory , any sensor that can be fitted to a module will be able to attach to a module and while @entity0 will make the shell , these modules will be made by other companies			1
by printing their own parts , users will also be able to customise them			0
circular devices recently commissioned @entity86 and his team at @entity88 to create the prototype , which was printed using a 3d printer			0
‘ as we are facing ever greater challenges of increasing consumption and decreasing resources , ’ @entity17 explained , ' we need new solutions			1
we need mobile standards that enable resource efficiency as well as platforms for hardware innovation			0
' when one part of the phone needs repair or upgrade there is no need to replace the entire device			0
' @entity105 was established to create that change - to create a mobile industry that is both ecologically and socially sustainable			1
' mr @entity86 added : ' we liked the openness of @entity3 , and the modularity of it and we can use it to demonstrate the capabilities of 3d printing			2
' in addition to switching out the hardware modules , @entity3 ’s operating system will also be customisable			1
in the future , the firm said it will release @entity3 standards to developers and manufacturers so they can use the concepts in their own devices			1
@entity17 plans to release the first @entity105 during the second half of 2015			1
it is currently seeking funding for the device , and is testing the prototype			0
in october , @entity0 unveiled the first working prototype of its own modular phone called @entity128 1			2
in a video , an engineer is shown turning on the device , unlocking it and launching an app during a video filmed at @entity135 in @entity136			0
individual modules are shown being added to , and removed , from the handset including the led module , battery , processor , speaker , and a usb port			2
each @entity3 is based around three elements - the spine , @entity31 and brain.the phone ’s lcd display , microphone and speakers connect to the @entity24			1
its @entity31 contains the battery , while the brain is where the camera and processor is kept			1
each of these segments can be slid out of the core , and replaced with another @entity3 is similar to the modular phone being built by @entity0 's @entity45			1
@entity159 1 , the device ( pictured ) is demonstrated during a video filmed at @entity135 in @entity136			0
individual modules are shown being added to , and removed , from the handset including the battery , processor , speaker , and a usb port ' the first step is figuring out how is this is going to work , ' explained the creative agency			2
' what are going to be the functions of the different parts of the system ? and then from there , we select specific components and draw schematics			0
' ' once you have a layout , you get the boards fabricated			0
' it ’s magical when you open up the box and say " oh my goodness , that ’s the thing we ’ve spent all these months designing			2
' the firm said that when the power is applied for the first time to the modules , it 's what is known as the @entity193			0
' your primary thought at that point is , is this thing going to start smoking ? ' continued the engineer			0
in the video , an engineer is also shown turning on the device ( pictured ) , unlocking it and launching an app. according to the developer kit files released in april , @entity45 phones will be able run on multiple batteries - when one battery dies , it can be detached and replaced with a full battery module ' is it going to overheat ? is there some critical error or not ? and then , once we have the individual pieces working we put them into the complete system			1
' in the video , a board is shown fitted with connectors			0
the designers then demonstrate sliding the components in and out			0
in the @entity128 prototype , 50 per cent of the phone is taken up by the modules , but @entity225 has made custom chips for @entity227 , which the company said will increase the amount of space on the device			0
@entity227 will be demonstrated at a developer ’s conference on 14 january			2

the files also revealed each phone will have a central ' spine ' and an endoskeleton - nicknamed ' endo ' - made of ribs that the individual modules will clip on to			0
this spine is shown in the @entity269 video at @entity135			0
there will be three different sized endos - including mini , medium and large - to rival the existing range of phones currently on the market , from compacts to phablets			0
larger @entity45 phones will be able to accomodate more modules than the mini will , for example			2

@entity3 concept is based on three elements - @entity24
display and speakers fit to the @entity24 , the battery attaches to the @entity31 , and its brain features the processor and camera
@entity17 plans to release the first @entity105 in 2015
it uses similar *principles* being developed by @entity0 ’s @entity45
prices for the @entity3 have not yet been *announced*
