a disabled @entity1 winner says he wishes he had never won his £ 20,000 prize after his new - found wealth meant his benefits were cancelled			1
@entity5 , 54 , hoped go on a luxury holiday in @entity7 , @entity8 after winning the five - figure sum on a @entity11 ticket			1
but he says he is instead counting the cost after the windfall meant he no longer qualifies for income support , housing benefit , a council tax reduction or any other means - tested handouts			1
@entity5 wishes he had never won £ 20,000 on the lottery after some of his benefits were cancelled mr @entity5 , of @entity20 in northern @entity21 , is now deemed to have savings over the government 's £ 16,000 limit and can only make what benefit bosses describe as ' reasonable expenditure '			1
he said : ' i wish i 'd never won this money , the hassle it has caused me			1
i wo n't be buying a ticket again			0
' mr @entity5 has been unable to work since he was left with mobility problems following a motorbike accident in october 1980 , when he was just 21			1
he had previously earned a living as a youth leader and disc jockey but since the accident has been forced to live on benefits			1
he receives disability living allowance ( @entity41 ) as well as housing benefit and council tax benefit			1
mr @entity5 said : ' that accident stopped everything in its tracks			0
i 've been buying tickets since the lottery started in 1994 and have won £ 10 here and there but nothing major until now			2
' he purchased a @entity11 ticket from the @entity52 on @entity20 's @entity53 earlier this month and went back on saturday to find out if he 'd won anything			1
he said : ' i went into the shop and handed the ticket over			0
the machine made a funny noise and i thought it was another £ 10 win but the sales assistant said " i think you 've won a wee bit more than £ 10 "			2
' when he said that , i looked out the window for the pink elephants to fly			0
' benefits rules mean that claimants can not spend any windfall in order to become entitled to handouts again it turned out that he had won £ 20,000 on the raffle , run as part of the @entity11 game			1
the @entity75 store was unable to pay out the winnings and @entity5 had to go to another store where he was given a cheque			0
his immediate thoughts were that he would pay off debts he owes to relatives and possibly visit @entity7 , a place he has always wanted to visit because of his love of music			2
government rules state that anyone with savings over £ 16,000 is not entitled to means - tested benefits such as income support , housing benefit and council tax reduction			1
however , they can still receive benefits which are not means - tested , such as disability living allowance and incapacity benefit			1
a complicated formula is in place to calculate benefit entitlement for people with savings of between £ 6000 and £ 16,000 , while anyone with savings under £ 6000 can receive benefits , if eligible			2
there are also rules in place to prevent anyone , such as mr @entity5 , who comes into an inheritance or windfall , from spending it in order to retain means - tested benefit			0
he has already been told that he will have to account for any expenditures he makes			0
he said : ' i thought how great it was to finally have some money and be debt - free			2
' i 've always wanted to go to @entity7			2
i 've never been abroad and have only flown once and that was off the back of a motorbike			0
' the furthest i 've travelled has been to @entity120			0
i was never meant to have any money			0
' @entity122 , from mr @entity5 's local @entity124 ( @entity124 ) manager , said : ' this is a great win for @entity5			0
' the information that i have is that it is all a matter of what is considered to be " reasonable expenditure " and that requires a discussion between the benefit providers and the claimant			0
' in this case that would be @entity5 , and the @entity124 would be happy to work with him , should he wish , to ensure that he complies with the benefit regulations and does not fall foul of any sanctions that may result from his windfall and to help him achieve his goals			0

@entity141 , 54 , was left disabled by motorbike accident *30* years *ago*

former *dj* thought his *dreams* had come true when he won lottery prize
but his hopes of visiting @entity7 , @entity153 were *dashed* by benefits bosses
