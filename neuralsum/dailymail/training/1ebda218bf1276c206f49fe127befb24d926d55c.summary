by @entity0 published : 06:22 est , 17 october 2012 updated : 07:53 est , 17 october 2012 a bride has told of the devastating moment she was told she had cancer on her dream wedding day			2
the ' baby ' she thought she was pregnant with turned out to be a tumour - and bride to be @entity8 from @entity9 was told it was cancerous hours before making her vows			1
but despite the bombshell news , @entity8 and her fiancé @entity11 vowed to go ahead with their ceremony – keeping the cancer a secret from their guests			1
tragic news : @entity8 on her wedding day with husband @entity11 , just hours after being told that what she thought was a growing baby bump was actually a cancerous tumour tinged with sadness : despite bravely going ahead with the wedding and keeping the cancer a secret from guests , the day was a challenge for @entity8 , who admitted she collapsed sobbing when the party had ended poignantly they promised to love each other in sickness and in health and now @entity8 is responding so well to chemotherapy that the couple hope to try for a baby again soon			1
@entity8 said : ' we had spent two years planning our dream wedding			1
i never expected anything to go wrong , i certainly never expected to hear the word cancer on the morning of my wedding			2
' we kept it from our guests because we wanted our wedding to remain a happy day			2
we wanted people to have a good time			2
' the nightmare started when @entity8 and @entity11 started trying for a baby ahead of their wedding			1
they hoped she would conceive quickly so they could share their joy during the speeches on the big day			1
naturally they were delighted when just weeks later a test showed @entity8 had fallen pregnant			1
' i was over the moon			0
we could n't believe how lucky we had been to fall pregnant so quickly			0
' shock : on the morning of the wedding the consultant rang to say @entity8 had experienced a full molar pregnancy			1
' i knew straight away it meant cancer			0
first i 'd lost our wedding baby and then i was being told i had cancer on our wedding day ' brave : ' we had spent two years planning our dream wedding			1
we kept the cancer news from our guests because we wanted our wedding to remain a happy day			1
we wanted people to have a good time , ' says @entity8 the pregnancy appeared to be progressing well , but a few weeks before the wedding @entity8 experienced severe morning sickness and tiredness			1
when she noticed light bleeding she called the pregnancy unit who assured her all the symptoms were normal			0
a molar pregnancy like the one experienced by @entity8 happens when a non-viable egg implants itself into the womb and begins to grow			1
it happens when a sperm , or more than one sperm , meets an egg during fertlisation , but the sperm and egg can not support a normal pregnancy			0
the cells mutate instead of multiplying normally and the placenta forms into cysts			0
occasionally the mutated tissues grows into the muscle layer of the uterus - an invasive mole			0
in rare cases like @entity8 's this can become cancerous and require medical treatment			1
' i started to relax and think of names			0
i imagined how wonderful our wedding day would be sharing our special news			1
but after a heavier bleed at six weeks she went to hospital for a scan to check their baby was ok			2
she says : ' i knew something was wrong when the sonographer said he needed a second opinion			0
finally a consultant looked at the screen and said ' i 'm sorry but there is no baby			2
' ' i thought he meant i 'd had a miscarriage			0
but then he explained there were dark shadows in my womb that showed i 'd had a molar pregnancy			0
' @entity8 had never heard of a molar pregnancy before			1
the consultant explained that at the moment of fertilisation something had gone wrong and two sperm had entered the egg instead of one , resulting in a mass of cells growing in the womb instead of a baby			2
the cells had stuck to the lining of the womb and were at risk of multiplying			0
@entity8 would need an operation to remove them			1
the condition had raised her hormones , which explained why she had suffered severe sickness and tiredness , like most pregnant women			0
devoted : @entity8 and @entity11 in @entity153 where they got engaged ' i was devastated			1
i could n't believe that there had never been a baby			2
we 'd been thinking of names for a child which had never existed			0
' the wedding was just two weeks away			0
back home bewildered @entity8 researched her condition on line and was shocked to read that in rare cases the cells can turn cancerous and spread around the body in what is known as a full molar pregnancy			1
the following week she underwent surgery to remove the tumour , which was to be analysed			0
' the wedding was a week away and mum and @entity11 suggested postponing but i did n't want all our planning to go to waste			0
' on the morning of the wedding on 16 september last year @entity8 had just finished decorating the tables when the consultant rang and confirmed she had experienced a full molar pregnancy			1
@entity8 and @entity11 were given the all clear to go on their honeymoon - and @entity8 started chemo on their return			1
now a year later tests show the cancer is under control ' i knew straight away it meant cancer			0
first i 'd lost our wedding baby and then i was being told i had cancer on our wedding day			1
' ' the room looked stunning and the ceremony was just hours away			0
i vowed not to break down and to get on with the day and @entity11 said he would support me whatever i decided			2
' hours later nobody would have known the importance behind the vows when they pledged to love each other in sickness and in health			0
' @entity8 says : ' it was very emotional , obviously the vows meant so much			1
' but she says there were thankfully fleeting moments of joy where she was able to forget about the cancer			0
when the party had finished she collapsed sobbing in her grooms arms			0
' it was partly because we 'd had such a wonderful day , but party i was terrified about having cancer			2
' she was given the all clear for their honeymoon in @entity222 and back home started blood tests to measure the hormone changes that would indicate if the cancer had spread			0
unfortunately they showed @entity8 did need to start chemotherapy			1
now a year after diagnosis , blood tests show @entity8 's hormones have dipped to their lowest yet and doctors are hopeful they will continue to fall giving her the all clear soon			1
it will be another six months before she can try for a baby again			2
' i 've learned early on that not everything in married life goes to plan			0
being told i had cancer on our wedding day was the hardest possible start , but now i know we can come through anything			2

kept the news secret on her big day to avoid ruining the event for her friends and family
@entity8 now responding well to chemotherapy and hopes to try for a baby again soon
