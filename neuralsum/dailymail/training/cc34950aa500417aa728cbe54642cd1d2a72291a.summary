by @entity1 reporter he may have been wanting to phone home , but nerds from the 1980s are still obsessed about the thought there may be hundreds of @entity7 games buried in a @entity9 landfill			1
after decades of rumors , digging will finally begin this weekend in a @entity9 landfill for an apparent stash of what some call ' the worst video game ever			1
' the dig at the @entity19 landfill is where the computer company @entity20 reportedly discarded millions of @entity23 game cartridges in 1983 and will start excavating on saturday morning along with officials from @entity26 - owned @entity25			1
get digging ! gamers will finally know the truth behind the gaming legend of whether or not @entity20 buried millions of video games cartridges of the epic flop @entity23 in a @entity9 landfill in 1983 fail ! the game was one of the worst commercially released games ever made and is often blamed for the game industry crash of 1983 after the success of the @entity37 film @entity20 snatched up the rights for an astronomical $ 22 million to release a game			1
the game was produced in just five weeks and was one of , if not the worst commercially released games ever made			2
despite being a complete flop , it was still one of the @entity45 's best selling game			2
two million copies were sold before anyone realised how bad it was			0
it left another three million copies left unsold			0
looking for @entity23 : crews begin digging at the old @entity19 , @entity9 to search for copies of the @entity20 game " @entity23 purportedly buried there in the 1980s the excavation will be open for public viewing			1

a roaring success : the video game was based on the wildly popular 1982 @entity37 movie about a boy who befriends an extraterrestrial who is mistakenly left behind on @entity90 one for the trash ! this game console is playing @entity23 , which is widely considered one of the worst games of all time			1
