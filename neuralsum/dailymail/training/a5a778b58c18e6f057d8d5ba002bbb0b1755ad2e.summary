@entity0 has seen a sharp rise in the number of people requesting food handouts as ' ordinary ' working people and families fall on hard times			1
in the past year alone @entity8 , which redistributes surplus food from major manufacturers and supermarkets to social care charities , has seen a 20 per cent rise in the number of people who ca n't afford to feed themselves - from 29,000 per day to 35,000 per day			1
food donations are ordinarily taken up by the homeless and destitute , but now @entity8 and similar organisations are seeing families and working people who have lost jobs benefiting from the service			2
on the rise : ordinary working people and families who have fallen on hard times are increasingly relying on free food handouts , says charity @entity8 ' we 're seeing a big increase in what you could call , for want of a better phrase , normal working people , those who have lost their jobs or seen their own businesses go under , ' @entity26 , manager of the food bank network told @entity37			2
' the big problem is that the welfare state is not reacting fast enough to need			1
' the time it takes for benefits payments to come through after a claim has been accepted is increasing , mr @entity26 added , resulting in people going hungry			0
however , a spokesman for the @entity46 denied there had been any changes to the system that would result in the increase			0
hunger : unemployment , redundancy and the time it takes for benefits payments to come through are all being blamed for the rise in demand of food handouts the food that is distributed by @entity8 would ordinarily go to landfill because it is out of date or is not fit for sale due to things like errors on packaging			2
an estimated three million tonnes of food like this ends up being thrown away in @entity0 every year of which @entity8 takes around 1 per cent			1
but a third of the charities surveyed by @entity8 are also facing government funding cuts , with 65 per cent of these charities slashing food budgets to stay afloat			0
another problem : a third of the charities surveyed by @entity8 are also facing government funding cuts , with 65 per cent slashing food budgets to stay afloat @entity77 , chief executive of @entity8 , said : ' at a time of unprecedented demand we want the food industry and the general public to increase their support			0
' ' we 're asking anyone who works in the food industry in any capacity to look at what is happening to their surplus food and to ask themselves a simple question : " could this food stop someone going hungry ? " '			0

number of @entity0 who ca n't afford food jumps from 29,000 per day to 35,000
' welfare state not reacting fast enough '
