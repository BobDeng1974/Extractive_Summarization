@entity0 , 35 , has to emerge slowly from bed few of us feel like leaping out of bed in the morning			1
but @entity0 has no choice but to emerge slowly from the covers			1
any fast movement - from dashing for the bus to jumping up to answer the front door - triggers nausea and dizziness so severe she could lose her balance , fall or even pass out			1
' i have to move at a snail 's pace when i get out of bed , ' says @entity0 , 35 , a company director			1
' i place my feet on the floor and slowly uncurl so my head is the last thing up			2
if i do it any other way i feel as if i am spinning			2
' it 's a pain , particularly as i have young children who want their mummy to spring into action in the morning			2
' i have to think about everything i do - something as simple as sitting on the floor to play with them and then getting up can be hazardous			1
the only exercise i can do is swimming , and that has to be a leisurely breast stroke rather than front crawl			2
' @entity0 's problem is low blood pressure - or hypotension - which affects millions of people			1
the symptoms are caused by poor blood flow to the brain - the lack of oxygen leads to dizziness , fainting and nausea			1
' hypotension in itself is n't dangerous in the way high blood pressure is - that is , it is n't a precursor to , say , heart disease or strokes , ' says dr @entity53 , a consultant cardiologist at @entity54			1
' what people do suffer with are lacerations and injuries - even fractures - as a result of falls or blackouts			1
' a normal blood pressure reading should be 120/70 - the upper figure , known as systolic pressure , measures pressure in your arteries when your heart contracts and pushes blood around your body			1
if the reading is less than 100 , this can trigger symptoms of low blood pressure			2
these can occur very rapidly , as @entity0 knows			1
' a few years ago i was at @entity77 , coming back from work , when i suddenly felt horrendously dizzy , ' she says			2
' i could feel everything spinning around me			2
i leant against a wall to steady myself , but then slumped to the ground			0
to make matters worse , a cyclist then crashed into me			0
' badly bruised down her leg from the impact , she was taken by passers - by to a nearby pharmacy			1
the staff measured her blood pressure and found it was extremely low - 80/50			1
after drinking water and resting for 45 minutes , the dizziness passed and @entity0 was able to make her way home to @entity96 , @entity97 , where she lives with her partner @entity98 , 37 , a sales director , and their children , @entity102 , five , and three - year - old twins , @entity104 and @entity105			1
low blood pressure is triggered by changes in the autonomic nervous system , which regulates the rate at which blood is pumped around the body			0
it can be genetic - @entity0 's father has it , too			1
a few years ago she suddenly felt very dizzy on her way home from work and slumped to the ground other causes include dehydration and vigorous exercise			0
this is because when we lose water - through not drinking enough or sweating - the blood loses volume and becomes more concentrated			1
pressure is lowered , as it takes longer for thicker blood to pump around the body			0
surprisingly , taking medication for high blood pressure - a condition that affects 16 million adults - can also trigger the symptoms of low blood pressure			1
' when someone who is being treated with very high blood pressure starts getting readings that are normal , the swing seems to cause them to feel light - headed and dizzy , so we have to manage their medication carefully , ' says dr @entity144 , a cardiologist at the @entity145			1
other medication , including anti-depressants , can also cause low blood pressure			0
some people get it only after changing positions , such as when standing up - a condition known as postural or orthostatic hypotension			1
when they stand , gravity sends blood to the legs and away from the brain			0
the heart rate increases and blood vessels tighten , causing a ' head rush '			0
symptoms should last only a few seconds , while the blood pressure readjusts to the body 's new position			0
low blood pressure can also occur after eating , known as postprandial hypotension			1
this is more common in older people , particularly if they have diabetes or , ironically , high blood pressure			1
a lot of blood is needed in the intestine for digestion			0
so , if the heart rate does n't increase to maintain blood pressure , it drops			0
some experience symptoms after standing for long periods			0
this tends to affect children and young adults , though it is unclear why			0
whatever form , hypo - tension can seriously interfere with day - to - day life			1
@entity187 , 26 , a marketing officer from @entity188 , @entity189 , had to miss surgery on her jaw because of it			0
low blood pressure can be genetic - @entity0 's father has it , too ' for a few years , i 've suffered with dizzy spells , sickness and black spots in front of my eyes if i move too quickly or stand for a long time , ' she says			1
the surgery was to fix a painful joint disorder - cartilage in her mouth had been displaced after she opened her mouth too widely to eat a burger			1
this left it painful to eat , talk or even smile			0
@entity187 says : ' they wheeled me down to surgery and did the pre-op tests			0
but when they took my blood pressure it was too low - the heart was n't pumping blood around my body quickly enough			2
' the surgery took place several months later , when her blood pressure had reached a safe level to operate			0
she achieved this partly by drinking lots of water			0
@entity0 's low blood pressure was identified by doctors at the age of nine , though no treatment was given			1
but her symptoms became especially acute when she was pregnant with @entity102			0
' i was vomiting up to ten times a day , ' she says			0
' i was put on salt tablets for around five months , which helped a bit			0
' @entity239 causes water to be absorbed into the blood , increasing its volume and so raising blood pressure - which is why people with high blood pressure are told to limit their intake			1
drugs such as @entity248 are occasionally prescribed by specialists to increase blood volume or to narrow the arteries - doing this means there is more blood flowing through a smaller space , helping maintain blood pressure			2
however , the main advice is lifestyle changes			0
these include simple steps such as avoiding sudden movements , and stretching or crossing and uncrossing the legs before standing up to prevent blood from pooling in the legs			0
compression stoc - kings can also make a difference , says dr @entity144			2
they provide extra pressure to the feet and legs , forcing blood back into the abdomen , where it can move freely to the brain			0
the proportion of people who do n't know their blood pressure patients should also avoid caffeine at night , and limit their alcohol intake to prevent dehydration			2
and some may need to add more salt to their diet , says dr @entity144			0
but this should be done only on a doctor 's advice , as overdoing it can raise blood pressure			0
if you think you have low blood pressure , see your gp			0
you may be given a 24 - hour blood pressure monitor to aid diagnosis			2
for @entity0 , anticipation is the key			1
' i know what my triggers are , so i do my best to avoid things that will cause problems , though i feel a bit silly sometimes when people see me moving around in slow motion , ' she says			2
' the other day , when everyone was rushing for the train home from work , i was meandering along			0
i 'd rather wait for the next train - it 's better than falling down because i feel so dizzy			2

@entity0 , 35 , from @entity96 , @entity97 , suffers from hypotension
people can get injuries - even fractures - as a result of falls or blackouts
