skyjacker : @entity6 hijacked a @entity36 plane from @entity37 , @entity38 , to @entity11 in one of the @entity36 most notorious mysteries but @entity41 said saturday that detectives have ruled the case a homicide			1
on november 24 , 1971 , a man in a suit and sunglasses calling himself @entity6 - later mistakenly identified as @entity6 - hijacked a @entity36 plane from @entity37 , @entity38 , to @entity11			1
after getting on the plane , he ordered whiskey and lit a cigarette before passing a flight attendant a note that read : ' i have a bomb in my briefcase			0
i will use it if @entity58			0
i want you to sit next to me			0
you are @entity60 ( sic ) hijacked			0
' at @entity62 , he released the passengers in exchange for $ 200,000 and four parachutes , and he asked to be flown to @entity66			1
somewhere near the @entity38 line , @entity6 leapt out of the plane			2
despite intensive searches , no sign of @entity6 ever emerged			2
investigators doubt he survived and have never been able to determine his true identity			0
but a boy digging on a @entity75 beach in 1980 found three bundles of weathered $ 20 bills - @entity6 's cash , according to the serial numbers			1
the parachutes provided to the skyjacker came from an @entity83 skydive center which had recently purchased them from @entity17			1
the one @entity6 apparently used was a military - issue @entity85 , nylon , 28 - foot with a conical canopy			1
over the decades , as parachutes were sometimes discovered in the area of @entity6 's jump , the @entity89 turned to @entity17 to ask if they were the real thing			1
plot : a hijacked @entity36 jetliner 727 sits on a runway for refuelling at @entity62 on november 25 1971 clues : three packets of ransom money , totalling $ 5,800 , were found on the @entity75 in february 1980 cool culprit : impressions of @entity6 as a smartly - dressed man have added to the fascination nature of the mystery ' they keep bringing me garbage , ' @entity17 told @entity108 in 2008 , after the @entity89 brought him a silk parachute discovered by children playing at a recently graded road in @entity3			1
' every time they find squat , they bring it out and open their trunk and say , ' is that it ? ' and i say , ' nope , go away			0
' then a few years later they come back			0
' that did n't keep @entity17 from having fun at the expense of reporters who covered that discovery			2
vital clue : @entity6 's cheap clip - on tie was one of the items recovered after the skyjack he told some who happened to call him on @entity131 that year that the chute was , in fact , @entity6 's			1

another said the newsroom was amused by the prank			0
' i 'm getting mixed reviews , ' @entity17 said			2
' but i 'm having fun with it			0
' the mysterious hijacking has intrigued everyone from federal agents to amateur sleuths			0
there were more than 1,000 possible suspects considered over the past four decades			0
several people even claimed to be @entity6 at times , but were dismissed on the basis of physical descriptions , parachuting experience and , later , by dna evidence recovered in 2001 from the cheap , clip - on tie the skyjacker left on the plane			2
many believe that @entity6 was @entity160 , a @entity161 veteran , experienced parachutist and @entity163 political science student who staged a similar hijacking several months later			0
but the @entity89 has said that @entity160 - who was killed in a shoot - out with law enforcement officers after a prison break in 1974 - simply did n't fit the description of @entity6 provided by two flight attendants .			1

home where murder occurred is owned by 74 - year - old @entity17 , who packed the parachutes for @entity6
