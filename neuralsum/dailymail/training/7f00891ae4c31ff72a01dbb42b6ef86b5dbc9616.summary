by @entity0 a brain - damaged father who was left to lay in urine - soaked sheets and covered in faeces in a @entity6 hospital in an ' appalling ' case of neglect that was secretly filmed by his family			1
@entity12 's wife @entity11 used a camera hidden in an @entity15 connector to record what happened while she was not there after he said he was being mistreated by carers			2
the 43 - year - old was left permanently paralysed down the left hand side of his body after suffering a massive brain haemorrhage			2
it showed him being left for hours lying in his own urine and his bell being ripped from his hand so he was left unable to call for help			1
it also revealed a nurse cleaning his feeding tube with a pen while he helplessly watched and staff giving him drinks - despite being strictly instructed to keep @entity12 on a nil by mouth diet			1
mr @entity12 , the director of an it company , suffered a severe brain haemorrhage in may last year when he collapsed at work			2
he was treated at two major hospitals before being sent to @entity50 at @entity51 in @entity52			1

' he was left in his own urine and faeces , it was very distressing			2
she claimed staff failed several times to help him visit the toilet and eventually she decided to secretly film him after she discovered him sobbing about his alleged treatment			1
mrs @entity72 , a mother - of - three , installed a secret camera and filmed his treatment over ten days - and was appalled at the results			1
she said : ' you can see a nurse cleaning his feeding tube by digging around with a pen , you see a nurse give him water when he 's strictly on a nil - by - mouth diet			1
mr @entity12 was only switched to another unit after his family showed the film to police and he was moved under a court order @entity12 was recovering from a massive brain haemorrage that means the left side of his body is permanently paralysed ' they leave him in his own urine , no one brushes his teeth			1
