by @entity0 published : 04:17 est , 5 october 2012 updated : 04:26 est , 5 october 2012 a scientist who helped design the trigger mechanism for the atomic bombs used in the @entity4 has died , at the age of 96			1
@entity6 , a former @entity7 ( @entity7 ) professor , was one of the early recruits to the @entity10 at @entity11 , a @entity13 government research project to develop atomic weapons during the war			1
however - during his research - he was never told the true purpose of the experiments , he later said			1
@entity6 pictured , left , in recent years and , right , as a young scientist			2
he was one of the early recruits to @entity10 and his work helped develop the trigger mechanism for the atomic bomb the mushroom cloud formed by the explosion of an atomic bomb			1
@entity27 said that , at the time of their work , he had no idea their research would be used for a weapon he had been hand - picked to join by @entity35 - his professor at the @entity36 , with whom @entity27 studied quantum mechanics			1
the @entity40 native devised what came to be known as the @entity27 bomb or @entity27 gadget , a plutonium implosion device			1
@entity27 died of natural causes at his home in @entity47 , surrounded by his family , according to @entity7 spokeswoman @entity49			1
according to a 1994 interview recorded in @entity7 's archives , @entity50 - born @entity27 showed mathematical prowess early in his schooling and skipped grades to graduate from the @entity56 when he was 19			1
the @entity11 laboratory in @entity58 , one of @entity10 's research centres when the first bomb was tested at @entity11 ( pictured ) , @entity27 said everyone was pleased to have succeeded in the experiment before the @entity10 began , @entity27 researched with the era 's leading physicists , including @entity67 @entity66 and @entity69 @entity68			1
he said in the 1994 interview : ' what i was told was that they were trying to make a chain reaction			0
' and the purpose of the chain reaction - well , it might be to drive submarines , or whatever			2
i was not told about bombs at the time			0
' when the first bomb was tested at @entity11 , @entity27 said everyone was pleased to have succeeded in the experiment , but a month later , when the atomic bomb was dropped on @entity86 , it was a very sobering experience			1
he added : ' there had been bombs dropped on cities			0
there had been firestorms , and so forth			0
i believe people nowadays do n't realise that in war your objective is to beat the enemy			0
' and unfortunately , mostly that involves killing a lot of the enemy to do that			0
so war is a very bloody thing			0
later in life , @entity27 opposed the further development of nuclear weapons			1
he became a member of the @entity110 's committee on dosimetry ' i felt then that although this was a terrible event , it probably saved many , many more @entity116 lives			0
they probably would have lost millions if they had had to defend themselves against an invasion			0
' later in life , @entity27 opposed the further development of nuclear weapons			1
he became a member of the @entity110 's committee on dosimetry , which studied the radiation effects of the @entity128 bombs			0
@entity27 taught theoretical physics , nuclear physics and astrophysics at @entity7 , going on to serve as faculty chair , vice president and provost , as well as acting president			2
while at @entity7 , he investigated pulsations in the brightness of stars , which are used to measure cosmic distances			0
@entity27 was awarded the @entity142 's @entity141 for his work			2
he was elected to the @entity144 in 1965			0
@entity146 @entity145 said that @entity27 was a major figure at the private university and a founder of a very important area of astrophysical research			1
@entity145 added : ' @entity152 was an outstanding theoretical physicist ; his contributions to scientific research , to public policy and his leadership helped in shaping what @entity7 is today			0
' a joint effort between the @entity13 , the @entity160 and @entity40 , the @entity10 was a research and development programme that produced the first atomic bomb during the @entity4			1
it began in 1939 as a modest operation , but grew to involve more than 130,000 people costing about $ 2billion working across 30 sites in @entity13 , @entity160 and @entity40 - some of them top secret			1
the first - ever nuclear device was detonated in @entity58 on july 16 1945			2
less than a month later it was unleashed on unsuspecting @entity116			0
on august 6 , 1945 , the @entity13 dropped a massive atomic bomb on @entity86			2
the equivalent of 20,000 tons of @entity171 , the a-bomb killed approximately 70,000 of civilians and flattened the city ( pictured )			0
another 70,000 died from the effects of radiation with five years			0
three days later , another atomic bomb was dropped on @entity177 , which killed about 70,000 people .			2

@entity6 was one of the early recruits to research project to develop atomic weapons during the war
native @entity40 devised what became known as the @entity27 bomb or @entity187 - a plutonium implosion device
he died of natural causes at his home in @entity47 , surrounded by *friends* and family
