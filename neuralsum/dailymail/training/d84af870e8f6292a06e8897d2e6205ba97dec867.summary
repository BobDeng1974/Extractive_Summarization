by @entity0 @entity1 has been forced to pay € 60,000 compensation to a group of 101 air passengers who were delayed for over 26 hours on a flight from @entity6 to the @entity7			1
sir @entity9 's airline made the payout following last month ’s @entity12 ruling at the @entity13 , which stated that airlines can not reject claims for delays caused by technical defects			1
the holidaymakers were delayed when flight @entity19 - travelling from @entity21 , @entity22 to @entity23 in october 2012 - developed a fault			1
grounded : holidaymakers were delayed on a flight from @entity22 to @entity23 in 2012 after the aircraft 's fire detector circuit developed a fault ( stock image ) lengthy delay : the passengers said they were due to board their flight at 7.35pm on 27 october but had to wait until the next day to depart the disgruntled passengers set up a @entity36 page to publicise their ordeal , which was caused by a fault with the aircraft 's fire detector circuit			1
they were due to board the aircraft at 6.40pm but had to wait until 9.20pm to take their seats			2
at 10.15pm the captain informed the passengers that the problem had still not been fixed and that they would have to disembark the aircraft			1
the holidaymakers were given a hotel room near the terminal for the night but claimed that they had to join a lengthy queue to check in and did not get their room keys until around 2am			2
they also said that they could not use the food vouchers they had been issued as there was n’t enough food available at the hotel , or enough staff to serve them			0
urgent repair work : @entity57 developed a fault with its fire detector circuit the passengers were give a hotel room for the night but said they had to join a lengthy queue to check in the group was picked up from the hotel the following day at 1.30pm and taken to the airport where they checked in at 2.30pm			1
they were eventually allowed to board the aircraft at 8.15pm and departed at 9.35pm , landing at @entity23 at 9.49am the next day , more than 26 hours later than scheduled			0
after contacting the @entity69 ( @entity70 ) the group was told that they had a valid claim for compensation under @entity73 but was later told that their flight did not in fact qualify for this compensation			0
long queues at the hotel meant that many holidaymakers did n't get their room key until 2am the passengers then contacted specialist flight delay law firm @entity82 in november 2013 , who issued group proceedings			1
the case was initially delayed pending the outcome of the @entity12 v @entity88 case in which air passenger @entity89 , 58 , took airline @entity88 to court to claim compensation for a delayed flight from @entity92 to @entity93 in 2011			1
mr @entity89 's flight was delayed by 27 hours because of a wiring defect			1
@entity88 had claimed that , under @entity73 laws , this defect constituted ' extraordinary circumstances ' that allows them to deny claims			0
however , @entity13 judges ruled that such technical faults are ' inherent in the running of an airline ' and as such can not be considered extraordinary			0
@entity1 paid € 600 ( £ 476 ) compensation to each passenger on the delayed @entity19 flight following the ruling			1
@entity109 , aviation lawyer at @entity82 , said : ‘ we are delighted to have been able to reach a settlement for these passengers			0
‘ since winning the case for our client mr @entity89 , we have seen a general trend towards airlines settling claims that have been on hold for months			0
' this is great news for consumers and we hope this signals the dawn of a new era of a much easier and smoother process for claiming flight delay compensation			2
’ a spokesperson for @entity1 told @entity128 : ' as a gesture of goodwill @entity1 has settled some existing court cases that were previously stayed pending the @entity13 decision in @entity12			2
' going forward , the lasting impact of the @entity12 decision on new cases remains uncertain and we are continuing to monitor developments in this area closely			2
' standing room only : the queue to check in to the hotel snaked out onto the driveway campaign : the disgruntled passengers set up a @entity36 group to publicise their ordeal the @entity70 said that passengers can ask airlines to review their compensation claims in the wake of the @entity13 ruling			1
rules state that passengers who reach their destination more than three hours late can claim up to € 600 ( £ 476 ) plus expenses , per person , if the delay is within the airline 's control			2
the case could open the door to hundreds of thousands of claims that had previously been turned down by airlines			0
however , @entity88 has already announced its intention to appeal again against the decision , this time by taking it to the @entity167 , and the @entity70 has warned that airlines might delay processing claims until the outcome of that case			0
the @entity70 initially caused consternation among passenger representatives on friday when they said that rejected claims could not be retrospectively reviewed in the wake of the @entity12 case			1
however , after checking the law again , it changed its stance			0
a spokesman said : ' the @entity70 apologises that our earlier advice was not clear			0
we will contact passengers who have previously sought our help to provide advice on the matter			0
the @entity70 will also provide guidance on the judgment to airlines			0
