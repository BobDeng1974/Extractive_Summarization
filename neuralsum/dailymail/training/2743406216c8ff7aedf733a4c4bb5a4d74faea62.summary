by @entity0 , political editor for @entity1 prime minister @entity5 , on a visit to @entity3 in @entity4 today , has insisted he will not resign if @entity6 votes yes @entity7 could be recalled as early as saturday , if @entity6 votes for independence			1
@entity5 will come under immediate pressure to address the nation if the @entity11 is torn up by thursday 's historic vote			1
the final result is expected around 7am on friday morning , which means mps could be summoned to @entity16 this weekend for the most important speech of mr @entity5 's premiership			1
there has been growing speculation that if @entity6 does vote for independence , mr @entity5 will have to resign , as the prime minister who oversaw the break - up of the @entity11			1
however , some economists fear a vote for independence could trigger a run on banks and a stock market crash			2
so mr @entity5 's first job will be to steady the ship and provide leadership to calm the markets			2
many @entity35 mps now say it is ' inevitable ' that @entity7 will be recalled this weekend , raising the prospect of the first saturday sitting since the @entity38			1
previous saturday sittings were ordered on the outbreak of @entity41 in september 1939 , the last summer sitting in july 1949 and the @entity42 in november 1956			0
a weekend debate in the @entity44 would be a chance for the @entity16 government to set out how it will deal with @entity47 , and carving up the @entity49 's assets , at a time when stock markets are closed			1
however , the move risks giving @entity35 mps and others the opportunity to publicly call for mr @entity5 to resign			1
during the final prime minister 's questions before the referendum , @entity35 mp sir @entity56 warned mr @entity5 : ' if we were to lose the @entity11 , it would be not only a disaster for @entity6 , but a national humiliation of catastrophic proportions			1
' today mr @entity5 signalled that he will resist calls to quit			2
speaking to reporters during a visit to a factory in @entity69 , @entity4 , he said he was determined to fight on to next year 's general election			0
' my name is not on the ballot paper			0
what 's on the ballot paper is ' does @entity6 want to stay in the @entity49 , or does @entity6 want to separate itself from the @entity49 ? '			2
' that 's the only question that will be decided on thursday night			0
the question about my future will be decided at the @entity49 general election coming soon			0
' with the opinion polls on a knife - edge , there is dismay among @entity35 @entity53 at the prospect of a possible @entity86 vote			0
even if the result is in favour of remaining part of the @entity49 , some conservative are angry at the way the three main party leaders have promised greater devolution of powers to @entity6 while continuing higher levels of public spending			1
it would be the first time the @entity44 has been recalled on a saturday since the @entity38 , and would be used to reassure the financial markets about the impact of the break up of the @entity49 with less than 24 hours to go until the polling stations open , 350,000 voters still do n't know who to support mr @entity5 sought to play down suggestions of backbench unrest , saying that the whole party believed in ' our family of nations '			1
' the @entity35 and all our backbenchers want to see the @entity49 survive and thrive , ' he said			0
the prime minister admitted that he was feeling ' nervous ' ahead of the vote , but insisted that he was confident about the case for a no vote			0
' well of course everyone who cares about our @entity49 - and i care passionately about our @entity49 - is nervous , ' he said			0
' but i 'm confident that we 've set out how @entity6 can have the best of both worlds - a successful economy with a growing number of jobs ... combined with the ability of @entity6 if they vote no to have even more powers and even more say over how to run their own affairs in @entity6			1
' bookies @entity130 today revealed the latest betting odds on the referendum outside the @entity7 in @entity133 on the bare backsides of kilt wearing @entity6 banks have been transferring millions of banknotes from @entity138 into @entity6 ahead of tomorrow 's referendum amidst fears high demand on cash machines if the country votes for independence			1
it is still not clear what currency would be used in an independent @entity6 , meaning that some @entity6 could rush to withdraw as many pounds as possible in the event of a @entity86 vote			1
in anticipation of the poll , extra supplies of cash have been moved north of the border to reassure @entity6 account - holders that they will have access to their money , according to reports			2
as the polls have tightened over the past few weeks , the value of the pound has fallen while large companies based in @entity6 have seen their shares dip due to the market uncertainty			2
panic : banks in @entity6 are stocking up on banknotes ahead of tomorrow 's referendum ( file photo ) banking sources told the @entity172 that they had transferred additional banknotes into @entity6 in case customers started panicking and withdrawing large amounts of cash			2
one said : ' this forms part of our contingency planning			0
we are , of course , monitoring the situation very closely from hour to hour			0
' another insider told the @entity184 : ' it is prudent for banks to stock up on demand			0
this happens normally in the run - up to @entity190 , and in that sense the referendum is no different			0
' banknotes are printed by the @entity194 , but their distribution is controlled by a small group of institutions including the @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 and the @entity201			0
they have been delivering huge quantities of cash to banks in @entity6 so they can stock up at branches and cash machines			2
however , the @entity194 would stand behind the pound in @entity6 as well as the rest of the @entity49 at least until march 2016 , when the country is set to split in the event of a @entity86 vote			1
in another attempt to reassure banking customers , financial institutions such as the @entity201 and @entity216 have promised to move their headquarters to @entity218 if @entity6 becomes independent , so they can enjoy the support of the @entity220 .			0

mps could be summoned to @entity16 to hear first *reaction* to the result
@entity5 will face immediate pressure to *explain* the impact of independence
he insists he will not resign as @entity230 if the vote goes against him
it would be the first time @entity7 sat on a saturday since the @entity235
even with a no vote , @entity5 under fire over more powers to @entity6
