by @entity0 published : 10:05 est , 4 june 2012 updated : 02:15 est , 5 june 2012 the new treatment uses a two - stage approach to stop cancers growing - and then destroy them from within medical experts in the @entity6 have made a major breakthrough in their research to keep breast cancer at bay for longer			1
a new drug , which has been tested , has been proven to stall the disease for longer than current treatments , providing fresh hope for patients			1
the @entity16 in @entity17 was among a handful of centres across the world to test a new treatment for advanced breast cancer			0
results from the study also show the drug , @entity26 , significantly reduces the side effects of chemotherapy			1
while @entity26 is undergoing further trials , the discovery is being hailed as a major step forward			1
dr @entity32 , consultant medical oncologist at the @entity33 , has played a key role in the study , which specifically looked at an advanced form of the disease known as @entity38 - positive			0
he said : ' for the first time in breast cancer , we have been able to significantly extend patients ’ remission time while also reducing the side effects associated with chemotherapy			0
' this is an exciting development because @entity38 - positive breast cancer is very aggressive			0
once it reaches the advanced stage it becomes difficult to treat and there is a real need for effective new treatments , like @entity26 , to improve the outlook for women with this aggressive disease			1
' @entity26 is known as an ' antibody - drug conjugate ' , which is the first medicine of its kind for breast cancer			1
it joins together the accuracy of the @entity38 - targeted antibody , called @entity63 , with the power of the chemotherapy agent , @entity26 , as a single therapy			2
@entity26 has been designed to find and destroy only the cancerous cells in a two - stage attack			1
firstly , it attaches to the cancer growth and blocks signals that encourage the tumour to get larger and spread			2
then it penetrates the cell ’s outer defences and releases a high dose of chemotherapy to destroy it from within			0
the study ’s results have been welcomed by breast cancer survivor , @entity78 , from @entity79 , @entity80			0
the 41 - year - old , who was diagnosed in 2005 and had treatment over four years , said : ' anything that helps people beat breast cancer is going to be good news and is very welcome			2
' it ’s lovely that advances are being made and it ’s especially lovely that the @entity90 has played a part in it			0
' results from the study show that more patients responded to @entity26 and for a longer period of time , compared with the currently licensed treatment known as lapatinib plus capecitabine chemotherapy			1
researchers believe the technique of attaching a powerful chemotherapy to an antibody , like @entity63 , could also change the way other breast cancers are treated in the future			0
@entity26 is already being trialled in the earlier stages of the disease where side - effects caused by chemotherapy , like diarrhoea and hair loss , have a huge impact on patients			1
the drug is not yet available for use			0
but based on the study ’s results , a licence application will be made for its approval in the @entity6 and @entity122			0
following authorisation from the @entity124 , @entity26 could be made available to patients in the @entity6 in less than a year .			2

drug @entity26 proven to stall the disease longer than current treatments , says @entity129
drug block growth of cancer , then destroys cancer cells from within
could be available for *sufferers* within a few years
