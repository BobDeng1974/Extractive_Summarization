click here to view our brilliant @entity2 service including @entity5 's leveller another night of heartbreak			2
just when it appeared @entity12 had something to smile about , their dreams of @entity10 progress were dramatically shattered by @entity14			1
they were within 90 seconds of reaching the last 16 but a reckless foul by substitute @entity17 enabled @entity18 to rifle in a penalty to secure a 2 - 1 win in @entity21 and allow @entity14 to progress to the last 16 for the first time in their history			1
@entity14 ’s joy was in sharp contrast to @entity12 ’s anguish			1
this game was played out with the death of @entity30 and @entity32 ’s brother @entity31 still fresh in the mind and their country has been hit by severe flooding in recent weeks			2
@entity30 accused @entity37 of lacking compassion and not allowing to spend time with @entity31 in the days after @entity37 won the @entity41 title			1

referee : @entity125 ( @entity126 ) attendance : 59,095 just when it seemed as though they would have something to smile about , when @entity131 ’s @entity5 scored in the 74th minute , their hopes were ripped away			0
for so long @entity12 have looked like they could make an impact at a @entity10 finals but their recent history in this tournament is littered with misfortune and near misses			1
in 2006 and 2010 , they were drawn in ‘ groups of death ’ and failed to make the knockout stages			0
this , then , represented their best opportunity to progress but even though they started brightly , with some surging runs from one - time @entity153 flop @entity110 and @entity37 ’s @entity30 , they did not have the gumption to turn the heat up on @entity14			1
their passing was slow and deliberate , taking two touches when one would have done			0
players who have been giants in the @entity41 , most notably @entity66 , failed to replicate the kind of form for which they are feared			0
@entity14 also lacked intensity in their efforts , which was surprising given their need for three points was arguably greater			1
to make matters worse , their gameplan was disrupted severely by having to make two substitutions in the opening half hour			0
the 2004 @entity174 champions , however , sensed there would be some reward for them if they could get on the front foot and in the 33rd minute , they came agonisingly close to taking the lead when @entity180 hit the bar after being set up by @entity182 striker @entity18			1
aerial duel : @entity12 centre back @entity106 gets the better of @entity18 in the air close control : @entity66 takes the ball down on his chest before charging forward hot pursuit : @entity14 frontman @entity87 attempts to catch @entity12 talisman @entity30 stretching : @entity108 and @entity180 challenge for the ball aside from rattling the woodwork , that shot also rattled @entity12 and , just before half - time , they conceded a goal that was of their own making when @entity198 ’s @entity109 squandered possession			1
substitute @entity71 ensured the slip received maximum punishment when he fired in from 18 yards			0
after the break , when @entity12 began to apply pressure , @entity14 ’s defending was excellent and every successful tackle was greeted with thumping slaps on the back and words of encouragement			2
they were in no mood to let this opportunity slip			0
@entity30 was still angry at what he claims was @entity37 ’s insensitive reaction to his brother ’s terminal illness			2
he told @entity216 : ‘ at the end of the season , i wanted to stay for four or five days with my brother before i flew to prepare for the @entity10 with @entity12 , except that @entity37 did not want to grant me a few days			1
‘ i went to celebrate the title championship in @entity221 while my brother was lying in his sickbed			0
by fortune , @entity32 was at his bedside			0
after that i blame myself for not insisting and for not making them respect me			0
’ last - ditch : @entity14 defender @entity82 dispossesses @entity108 going down : @entity88 falls to the floor inder the challenge of @entity12 frontman @entity108 running rings around the opposition : former @entity153 man @entity110 marauds forward with the ball battle : @entity232 of the @entity12 attempts to barge past @entity233			1

@entity235 crash out at the group stage after another poor tournament
coach @entity239 stands down with contract coming to an end
former @entity182 and @entity37 striker @entity18 earns @entity43 win
@entity14 face @entity246 in last 16 with place in quarter - finals at stake
