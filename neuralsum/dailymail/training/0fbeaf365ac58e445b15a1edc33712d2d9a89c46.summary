by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 07:27 est , 29 december 2012 updated : 13:33 est , 29 december 2012 @entity3 staff members have taken to wearing ear plugs after ' noisy ' performances were carried out inside the newly - revamped headquarters in @entity7			1
the complaints over loud music came as the Â£ 1billion development of @entity11 , in @entity12 , nears completion			1
the building was designed to include atrium spaces , which were thought could enable @entity3 staff and audience members to meet and watch performances			1
new : @entity19 piazza performance space was designed so audiences and @entity3 staff members can interact but the idea has not met with wholehearted approval from staff , who have complained about the noise emanating from inside the headquarters			1
@entity26 , a producer on @entity27 on the @entity28 , wrote to the @entity3 's magazine @entity30 about the matter			2
he said : ' i work on the seventh floor in @entity11 and the level of noise made it extremely difficult to concentrate on work - you could hear it even with headphones on			0
some @entity3 staff resorted to wearing ear plugs to avoid being distracted by the noise outside ' it 's [ atrium ] not suitable as a performance space , as the noise gets to so many parts of the building and affects so many people who are trying to work hard			1
' even if it was the loveliest music in the world , there are lots of other distractions in the open plan design and we do n't need any more			2
' according to @entity56 , another @entity3 worker said he and his colleagues used ear plugs to drain out the noise			2
however the @entity3 have acknowledged the issues raised regarding noise levels			2
a spokesperson told @entity63 ; ' this was a one - off event held in an indoor atrium space			0
' we have taken on board staff comments , and as a result , do not plan to hold an event of this kind again in this area of the building			0
' this is all part of the natural learning process of settling into a new building			0
' the outdoor @entity77 , which on the other hand will be encouraged to be a performance space , is due to be fully opened from april 2013			0
created by @entity81 , the space has been described as a new ' art pavement at the heart of the new central public space ' , it consists of more than 750 stone flags inscribed with place names from around the world and there is a subtle scheme of small embedded lights with audio installations			0
the @entity3 said : ' this unique public arena will provide a place to linger and see the @entity3 in action , a performance and exhibition space and a cafe			0
' @entity19 reflects the global dimension of the @entity3 's broadcasting			1

loud music and noise from atrium areas distracting workers in open - plan *environment*
@entity3 staff will be *hoping* it 's not a sign of things to come with the new ' @entity19 ' piazza close to completion
