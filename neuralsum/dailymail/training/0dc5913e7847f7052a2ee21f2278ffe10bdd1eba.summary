@entity0 has moved to quash fears over @entity3 's dip in form at @entity5 , claiming his explosive start to life in the @entity8 was atypical for a foreign import			1
ahead of @entity11 's star - studded friendly against @entity13 at @entity14 , the head coach was at pains to point out that @entity17 's performances during this season 's infancy were at odds with what was expected			1
the 26 - year - old made a big - money move to @entity5 from @entity24 over the summer and appears to have not been exempt to the suffering felt by @entity26 's squad during a campaign to have started slower than @entity29 ' ill - fated reign			1
@entity3 's look on during his team 's training session at @entity34 's training complex @entity0 addressed the media before the clash and backed @entity17 to shine at @entity14 cost : £ 60m from @entity24 ( august 2014 ) debut : @entity37 ( a ) 30 august games : 9 goals : 3 assists : 5 @entity5 can point towards an ever - expanding injury list as reason enough for lagging behind @entity43 at the top of the @entity8			1
questions are , however , beginning to circulate as to why their £ 60million signing has not dragged the @entity48 through games - notably in the defeat against @entity34 and draw at @entity51			2
@entity0 inferred that @entity17 has been a victim of his own early success			1
' i have to say that @entity3 is one of the very top players in world football , ' he said			1
' his start was exceptional and the fact that generally when players go to a new club and have to get used to a new league , a new team , a different style of football and different team - mates , i think the form that he is showing now is possibly more typical of a player going to a new club than the very first few games when he burst onto the scene and did so well			1
' arguments rage as to how best @entity72 utilises @entity17 , but @entity0 opted to turn that round ; the former @entity75 boss believes the midfielder is capable of plugging any gaps needed in the north - west			1
there is a sense that trial and error may be the way for @entity5 to grow long - term			2
@entity17 scored three times in his first five @entity5 games , but his form has tailed off slightly @entity11 manager @entity0 takes a training session at @entity34 's @entity88 on monday ' with regards to his position , i would say that @entity3 is the type of player who can play a number of different roles expertly , ' he added			1
' you only have to look a few seasons back when he played on the right side for @entity24 and in the season just gone , he featured more on the inside - left in a slighter freer role			2
' obviously , in the @entity101 , he did very well when he played wide left so really , in terms of positioning , he can adapt to anywhere where the manager asks him to play			0
' @entity0 was full of praise for his players before the @entity109 showdown and claims @entity110 should win the @entity111 as well as insisting @entity11 's clash against @entity13 is one worth watching			1
the former @entity75 boss looks set to start @entity110 , despite playing a full 90 minutes at @entity113 last week , and characterises the friendly as important in gauging how far his side has to go ahead of next year 's @entity116			1
' you ca n't take out that i am @entity119			0
i 'm not the best person to judge because i ca n't separate sentiment			0
i 'm not the most objective i would still vote for him [ @entity110			2
] @entity0 has backed @entity110 ( right ) to win the @entity111 , with the @entity119 shielding the @entity125 cold from his hands along with team - mate @entity127 during monday 's training session @entity110 scored the winning goal in a 2 - 1 win against @entity131 at @entity113 and is set to start vs @entity13 ' games like this are a good test for us in trying to lessen the amount of space			1
we are famous for our attacking style but we 've got to try and balance out how we defend on a team			0
' it 's always a good feeling when you 're playing in a stadium like this and each game has importance			2
it 's all about constantly improving the squad			2
i 've picked my team already			0
' the idea is to look at as many as we possibly can but we need a base of players who are a nucleus			0
we hope to give some fresh faces a run out			0
' these games and tours abroad are similar for all managers			0
we try to get on together and build a spirit but at the same time everyone is trying to win their place			0
our short - term objective is the @entity116			0
' coaches can dress friendlies up to be more relevant than they are but we have the @entity101 runner - up and a huge team in @entity169 so you do n't need to dress this up			0
' we 've both got greater aims - @entity116 and the @entity173 - but it is an important game and we 'll be approaching it with the seriousness you 'd expect			0

@entity11 and @entity13 will clash in friendly at @entity14 on *tuesday*
@entity0 said @entity3 's form was typical for a new signing
@entity11 boss backs @entity110 to win @entity111
@entity0 also claims @entity5 will bounce back as a big club
