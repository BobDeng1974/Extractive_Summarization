by @entity0 published : 05:32 est , 1 may 2013 updated : 07:27 est , 1 may 2013 three mortuary managers could face prosecution after missing 10 chances to realise they had given the family of a paratrooper who died in custody the wrong body for burial			1
@entity10 's relatives unwittingly buried the body of a 77 - year - old woman in 2000 but 11 years later it was realised there had been a mistake			1
the error was only discovered when the @entity17 family of @entity18 arrived to prepare her body for burial in november 2011			1
former paratrooper : three managers at the mortuary where @entity25 's body was found - more than a decade after he was supposed to have been buried in @entity26 , now ' may have a case to answer ' mr @entity25 , a 37 - year - old @entity28 war veteran , had died on the floor of a police station in the city in april 1998 , with his arms handcuffed behind his back and his trousers around his ankles			1
@entity36 carried out a 15 - month investigation into the incident which was when they realised that mrs @entity18 's body was where mr @entity25 's should have been			1
the inquiry team ‘ believe that three members of the management team of the mortuary between december 1 , 1999 and november 4 , 2011 may have a case to answer ’ , according to a summary			2
the report says : ‘ the investigation team have identified 10 occasions during this period of time when they had the opportunity to identify that the body purporting to be @entity18 was in fact @entity25 and working practices prevented this			1
‘ @entity58 must consider whether they have been “ wilfully negligent ” and whether the evidence is sufficient to pass the evidential test to support a charge and secure a successful prosecution for the criminal offence of misconduct in a public office			2
’ mr @entity25 was punched during an argument outside a nightclub in his home city of @entity26 in 2008			1
he was taken to hospital where he became hostile which has been put down to his head injury during previous investigations			2
he was discharged and police arrested him for breach of the peace			2
tragedy : mr @entity25 , a 37 - year - old @entity28 war veteran , died on the floor of a police station in @entity26 in 1998 @entity79 : by the time he arrived at @entity81 police station , he was unconscious and his trousers were around his knees			1
he was left handcuffed on the floor while the four officers looked on and did nothing by the time he arrived at @entity81 police station he was unconscious and his trousers were around his knees			1
in the custody suite he was left handcuffed on the floor while four officers looked on and did nothing			0
they could allegedly be heard on @entity79 footage making monkey noises as he lay dying for 11 minutes			0
they later claimed they thought he was ‘ putting on an act ’			0
but a damning report by the @entity97 found the men responsible of ‘ unwitting racism ’			2
' appalled ' : mr @entity25 's sister @entity100 , 51 , said she was angered by what appeared to have happened in the mortuary it concluded that pc @entity109 , pc @entity104 , pc @entity106 and sergeant @entity107 - who all refused to co-operate with the @entity97 investigation - were guilty of a ‘ most serious neglect of duty ’			1
the officers were charged with manslaughter but acquitted at @entity114 in 2002 on the orders of the trial judge			0
mr @entity25 ’s sister @entity100 , 51 , said she was angered by what appeared to have happened in the mortuary , but added that if ‘ working practices ’ were to blame it raised the prospect of similar mistakes happening to other families			1
‘ i am absolutely appalled , ’ she said			0
‘ if they ’re saying it ’s policy and procedures , it ca n’t have been the same people dealing with it all the time , so are they saying nobody did their job right ? ‘ i do n’t believe that for one minute			0
if that ’s the case how many times have they buried the wrong people ? how can they be sure they have n’t done it before ? ' if it ’s down to policy and procedures there ’s a good chance something like this has happened in the past and nobody knows about it			0
’ the mortuary was initially run by @entity145 before being taken over by @entity26 and @entity146			2
neither organisation would say when the transfer took place			0
a spokesman for the trust said : ‘ while this matter remains the subject of a criminal investigation the trust can not comment			0
’ @entity156 , the council ’s corporate director for city services , said : ‘ we understand the file has been forwarded to the @entity161 for their consideration and we are awaiting the outcome of their findings			0
’ @entity36 was asked to carry out the inquiry by @entity167 because of the sensitive history of the case			0
caught on camera : the officers could allegedly be heard on @entity79 footage making monkey noises as he lay dying for 11 minutes			0
they later claimed they thought he was ' putting on an act ' huge blunder : he was arrested for a breach of the peace and taken to @entity81 police station			1

@entity28 veteran @entity25 died at a @entity26 police station in 1998
blunder discovered when body of @entity17 woman , 77 , could *n't* be found
