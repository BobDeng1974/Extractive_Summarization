it ’s the changing face of @entity2 politics			1
when @entity2 president @entity4 appeared on tv today to insist none of the country ’s troops are positioned in the @entity9 , he looked decidedly fresh - faced for a man accused of war - mongering			1
the wrinkles on the 62 - year - old 's forehead , clearly visibly in previous pictures , have disappeared , while his skin look smooth , taut , tanned and younger than ever			2
@entity4 appeared on @entity2 tv today like you have never seen him before - leading to questions that he has had cosmetic surgery to get rid of the bags under his eyes , wrinkles and make his face more chiseled his appearance this week is radically different to how he was previously pictured in 2007 ( left ) and 2010 ( right )			1
in both photographs the skin of @entity4 's face is more saggy , and he has visible dark circles under his eyes and as this series of pictures show , the @entity2 president 's face has changed dramatically over the years – amid persistent rumours he has undergone cosmetic surgery to give himself a more youthful look			1
a black and white picture taken in 1991 when he was 37 years old shows him looking gaunt , and black bags under his eyes are clearly visible			0
@entity4 , pictured in 1985 ( left ) with his wife @entity40 and daughter @entity41 , and in 1991 ( right ) when he was chairman of the @entity42 of @entity43 , aged 37			0
his hair was already receding pictures taken in 2000 ( left ) and 2001 ( right ) , when @entity4 was in his forties , also show ' crow 's - feet ' on his eyes during his first term at president in 2007 @entity4 , then aged 55 , looked his age while still healthy in a photo dated 2000 , @entity4 ’s hair still has tones of blonde but the signs of ageing are becoming more apparent on his features			0
fast - forward to 2010 , and the ' action man ' , now 57 , looks tired and haggared after taking part in a judo session questions over whether @entity4 had gone under the knife came to the fore in 2011 , when the then - prime minister was photographed with a yellow bruise on his face			0
@entity2 media began to question whether @entity4 had had plastic surgery in 2011			2
pictured here announcing his intentions to run to become the president of @entity2 , journalists wondered if that bid sparked the surgery @entity4 's face was puffy but relatively wrinkle - free in december 2013 when he attended a conference in @entity77 plastic surgeons at the time told @entity80 that @entity82 injections , a facelift , cheek - fillers , a brow lift and removal of the bags under his eyes would have helped improve his ageing features – although his spokesman denied at the time he had had any work done			1
but in the same year he announced he wanted to become the next president of @entity2 , leading commentators to ask if that was the reason behind his new look			2
in december 2013 , after around two years in office as president , he looked vastly different again , his face puffy but wrinkle - free			1
and in march this year , the @entity99 was forced to deny rumours that he was unwell – or had undergone surgery – when the president disappeared for 10 days , cancelling a string of appointments and public appearances			1
questions were raised about @entity4 's health when he met with the president of @entity109 last month after a 10 day disappearance			2
he refused to explain where he had been saying ' it would be boring without gossip ' @entity4 , pictured on april 16 2014 - looking relaxed and youthful as he give a television interview about @entity9 when he emerged to meet with the president of @entity109 his face was puffy and shiny , and eyes only able to partially open , leading journalists to wonder about the cause of his new look			0
however @entity4 has remained tight - lipped about his absence , laughing off the suggestions of poor health - or rumours that he had been attending the birth of a love child - saying ; ' it would be boring without gossip			0
' his latest appearance is unlikely to quell suggestions that @entity4 has been knocking on the doors of plastic surgeons			0
@entity4 was recently reported as saying he wo n't be in office past the year 2024 , when he will turns 71 years old - although these pictures suggest there is a good chance he wo n't look it .			0
