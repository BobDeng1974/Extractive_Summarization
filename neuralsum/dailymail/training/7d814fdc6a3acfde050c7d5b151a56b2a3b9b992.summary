@entity0 was a game made for three , according to the first @entity3 rule book			1
our ancestors started playing the game outdoors for the first time thanks to a @entity9 lawyer who experimented with the sport			1
instead of the @entity12 as we know it with strict singles and doubles teams - and no mixing of the sexes - the early @entity11 were more liberal			2
first rules : the 1874 ‘ lawn tennis or @entity22 ’ by @entity23 was the first of its kind history : @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity9 , where the first ever game of lawn tennis was played in 1859			1
the modern game is now played by millions all over the world in a version called the @entity33 one player could play against two opponents			1
and while ladies were discouraged from playing in general , they were permitted to battle against the men			1
this means if @entity12 were played the @entity3 way we could see a big female name like @entity43 play the likes of @entity45 and @entity46			1
tennis experts insist the @entity51 tennis or @entity50 rules of the game by @entity23 was the first of its kind			1
how to play : in a version of the game called the @entity33 one player could play against two opponents			1
and while ladies were discouraged from playing - they were permitted to battle against the men former @entity63 teachers @entity64 , 69 , and @entity65 , 68 , from @entity66 in the @entity67 explained the difference the modern game has with the tennis of yesteryear			1
' the version of tennis where two people against one was called the unicorn match			1
classic : pictured is old - style tennis gear at the grave of @entity81 , who invented to modern game ' the game could be played with a racket from the old real version of tennis that was indoors , a wooden bat from the old medieval game five , or simply with the hand			1
' the scoring was to 15 , where whoever reached this figure first in single points would win the game			2
' there are several contenders for the title of ‘ inventor of tennis ’			2
the game was patented by @entity102 in @entity103 and the game became a global sporting phenomenon shortly after this - with tennis courts popping up from the @entity107 to @entity108			0
by 1877 the @entity109 held the first tournament at @entity12			0
however , the game evolved from a combination of real tennis - which was played with a ball and net , but was the exclusive preserve of the aristocracy - and rackets which was popular with the working classes in pubs and prison yards			0
ms @entity64 , @entity65 and a host of other tennis - buffs believe the true pioneer of the game was @entity23 , who brought the game outside thanks to the new innovations in technology at the time			0
he is understood to be the inventor of lawn tennis			0
@entity23 created the game of lawn tennis with friend @entity133 in a back garden in @entity27 , @entity9 , before forming the first lawn tennis club in @entity136 in 1872			0
' for the first time the newly developed @entity138 rubber allowed balls to bounce on grass , ' said ms @entity142			0
' also the invention of the lawn mower meant that grass was now in such well - kept state that play was possible on the lawn			2
' it ’s only thanks to these new types of technology that the game of tennis as we know it could evolve			0
' the game we now recognise as tennis was formalised in the 19th cenutry as ' lawn tennis '			0
@entity162 rubber balls and well - kept lawns were now available across the land to enable what we previously an indoor sport to move outside			0
but early version of the game have existed since the 12th century , where @entity170 monks would play at hitting balls back and forth with their palms			1
the so - called @entity174 ( game of the palm ) took centuries to develop into a game involving nets and rackets			2
by the 16th century , the game was popular in both @entity182 and @entity170 , and would be played with solid rackets , much like the offshoot sport known as real tennis today			0
modern : @entity0 changed significantly in the decades to come - pictured in @entity45 about to take a shot in the semi-final of last year 's @entity12 tournament the name tennis comes from the @entity170 word tenez - an instruction to ' hold ! ' or ' receive ! ' which players would shout to their opponent before serving			1
it was a favourite of @entity196 king @entity195 , whom some accounts say was playing a match while his second wife @entity199 was executed			2
it 's place in @entity182 and @entity170 history was confirmed during the reign of @entity203 , when @entity205 's @entity204 was first performed			0

the warlike king then promises to ' march our rackets to these balls ' and ' play a set shall strike his father 's crown ' - fulfilled by their clash at the @entity227			2
tennis societies and associations proliferated across @entity230 in the late 19th century , with the first @entity12 tournament played in 1877			0
