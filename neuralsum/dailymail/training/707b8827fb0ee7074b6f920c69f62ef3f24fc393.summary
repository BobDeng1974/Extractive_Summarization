@entity0 , 28 , pictured left with comedian @entity1 , was fined £ 385 and ordered to pay £ 600 costs at @entity3 ’ @entity4 in may 2010 but it has been overturned telling jokes about blowing up an airport is not a crime , the lord chief justice ruled yesterday			1
in a landmark @entity4 ruling , lord judge overturned the conviction of a frustrated airline passenger who tweeted that he meant to blow up the airport			2
@entity0 , 28 , had been convicted of sending a menacing message even though he broadcast his joke in his own name and no one at @entity18 in @entity19 took it seriously			1
the @entity21 took him to court under the 2003 @entity22 , and @entity19 magistrates told him to pay £ 600 costs , a £ 385 fine and £ 15 victim surcharge			1
the conviction in may 2010 was later upheld by a @entity28 judge			2
but yesterday the lord chief justice said a joke could not by definition be menacing : ‘ if the persons who receive and read it , or may reasonably be expected to receive it , or read it , would brush it aside as a silly joke , or a joke in bad taste ... it would be a contradiction in terms to describe it as a message of a menacing character			2
’ the ruling was hailed as a victory for free speech and a rebuke to over-zealous police and lawyers			2
mr @entity0 , from @entity51 , @entity52 , lost his job as an administration manager after he was convicted and said he had become unemployable because of the prosecution			1
he sent his tweet when snow shut the airport in january 2010			1
it said : ‘ @entity18 is closed			1
you ’ve got a week and a bit to get your s * * * together otherwise i am blowing the airport sky high ! ! ’ he said after the ruling : ‘ it ’s a very big decision for people doing what human beings do – telling a joke sometimes , even if it ’s a bad one			2
’ the judges noted there was no evidence before the @entity28 to suggest any of the followers of the ' tweet ' , or anyone else who may have seen it posted on mr @entity0 ’ timeline , found it to be of a menacing character or , at a time when the threat of terrorism was real , even minimally alarming			1
in fact , nothing was done about it by anyone until five days later when the duty manager responsible for security at the airport , while off duty at home , found it			1
offence : the tweet by @entity0 that he was originally convicted over frustration : mr @entity0 said he sent the tweet as he was annoyed that @entity18 in @entity98 was closed by snow in january 2010 @entity100 , for the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) , had said that , on any view , mr @entity0 , of @entity51 , @entity52 , a man of previous good character who worked as an administration and finance supervisor , was ' very foolish ' to do what he did			1
he said the question was , by whose standards and by what members of society would such a message be viewed as a joke , given that those who had access to it would probably not have any knowledge of the circumstances which led to it being sent ? @entity118 welcomed the ' complete vindication and victory ' for mr @entity0 following today ’s ruling			1
the broadcaster and comedian , who stood alongside mr @entity0 during an earlier appeal hearing , took to @entity125 to congratulate him and his legal team			1
the star , who is taking a break from the social networking site , wrote : ' pops head up quickly : complete vindication and victory for @entity0 in twitterjoketrial			1
well done @entity132 and team			0
bye ! ' @entity118 , a prominent @entity125 user , tweeted at the time that he would be happy to pay @entity135 ' fine fellow comedian @entity1 , who was in court for the ruling , wrote on @entity125 ' he ’s won ” , before adding : ' colossal relief here in court			2
' in the ruling , lord judge said the @entity143 , which came into force before @entity125 was invented , did not create ' some newly - minted interference with the first of president @entity148 ’s essential freedoms - freedom of speech and expression			0
' satirical , or iconoclastic , or rude comment , the expression of unpopular or unfashionable opinion about serious or trivial matters , banter or humour , even if distasteful to some or painful to those subjected to it should and no doubt will continue at their customary level , quite undiminished by this legislation			0
' given the submissions by mr @entity164 , we should perhaps add that for those who have the inclination to use @entity125 for the purpose , @entity165 can be quoted unbowdlerised , and with @entity172 , at the end of @entity171 , they are free to speak not what they ought to say , but what they feel			0
' ' the more one reflected on it , ' he added , ' the clearer it became that the message did not represent a terrorist threat , or any other form of threat , but was a ' conversation piece ' for mr @entity0 ’ followers			1
it was not sent to anyone at the airport or anyone responsible for airport security , or any form of public security			0
the language and punctuation were inconsistent with the writer intending it to be , or to be taken as , a serious warning			0
there was no urgent response to it from the airport and police action was ' not exactly hurried '			0
celebrity support : @entity118 welcomed the ' complete vindication and victory ' for mr @entity0 on @entity125 lord judge said that , while proper respect must be paid to the @entity28 ’s finding , that did not address the unbroken pattern of evidence to be derived from the responses of those who read the message , and no weight appeared to have been given to the lack of urgency which characterised the approach of the authorities			1
outside court , mr @entity0 said that as a result of the prosecution he had lost two jobs and become ' unemployable '			2
' it ’s been two - and - a - half years			0
at the moment i ’m just feeling relieved			0
the lord chief justice just seemed to get it			0
' he added : ' it ’s an important decision as far as social networks are concerned and as far as @entity125 is concerned			0
it has established that there has to be an action that is menacing and is intended to be menacing			0
it ’s a very big decision for people doing what human beings do - telling a joke sometimes , even if it ’s a bad one			0
' comedian @entity1 , who arrived to lend his support , said the case had been ' ridiculous '			0
' in 100 years there will be an operetta about this - about how ridiculous we were at the start of the 21st century			0
i ’m a big fan of absurdity but this is taking the biscuit			0
' he added : ' @entity0 was doing what we all do sometimes in the heat of the moment			1

@entity0 posted the tweet in a moment of frustration after @entity18 was closed by snow in 2010
magistrates fined him £ 385 saying the tweet was ' clearly menacing ' and that airport staff were concerned about it
today judges said there was no evidence that any followers who saw the tweet found it to be menacing or alarming
celebrity *backers* *including* @entity118 welcome the ' complete vindication and victory '
