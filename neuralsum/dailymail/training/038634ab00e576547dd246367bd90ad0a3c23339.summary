by @entity0 the problem of living in @entity2 is that everyone wants to come out and visit you			1
even my agent ( @entity8 's answer to @entity10 's @entity9 ) came up with a excuse to come over and he rarely travels anywhere outside the @entity13			2
so when you are trying to lead a quiet and clean - living life , there are constant temptations from random colleagues and friends coming over and you feel obliged to entertain them			1
they have just travelled 3,500 miles for heaven 's sake			0
last week my ex-city colleague @entity23 came over , and my friend and @entity26 singer @entity24 was on her way back to the @entity28 to play at @entity29 , so we had a goodbye celebration at the @entity32			2
we went along with @entity0 and @entity0			1
i was n't even aware there was a downstairs although perhaps i should have worked it out from the name			2
later in the week @entity0 took us to a @entity37 in @entity50			1
a @entity37 is a @entity51 at a club – we did n't make this up , it 's a @entity2 thing			1
it was at this amazingly cool club called output in @entity50 on a saturday			0
blazing sunshine , good tunes and great times			0
@entity0 later broke from the group and met up with the @entity60 cheerleaders			1
i think the decent thing would have been to check in on @entity62 and wait for us to locate him and the @ @entity65			0
@entity0 , @entity24 and @entity0 enjoy the @entity2 nightlife @entity2 is famous for its rooftop parties as @entity0 found out @entity0 and i are still trying to do us best to fight the inevitable decline of our bodies against this onslaught and he has taken to using @entity74 fitness app. it 's the latest @entity76 app designed by top international fitness experts , an @entity79 exploration team and the developers of @entity81			1
the blurb on @entity83 says , ' fun and effective workouts '			0
@entity0 did n't look like he was having much fun , he looked pretty ruined afterwards but i suppose that 's the point			1
i 've been joining him without the aid of an electronic fitness instructor but with the added boost from a couple of @entity94 supplements			0
to be fair the fat burner routines on the app are pretty good , and so we just about maintaining our physiques			0
mr @entity99 : @entity0 and @entity36 make new friends at the @entity37 @entity0 was eager to break away from the group and spend time with the @entity103 i am becoming slightly homesick now for one big reason			1
it 's coming up on sunday 6th july and @entity107 starts in earnest next thursday with the gp ball at @entity109 in the @entity110			0
my old pal @entity111 is running the event and last weekend he had the @entity113 racing one of their cars around @entity116 just for shits and giggles			0
he works out : @entity0 looks tired after his @entity120 exercise regime wish i 'd been there , i 'd have given anything for a go in that car – it was the old 2013 @entity126 car – loud as hell and very fast			2
they were trying to raise awareness in a @entity8 road race like @entity131 , and that would be something amazing			0
you can see it on the video here			0
that 's one thing that could never happen in @entity2 – there are no bends in the roads in @entity142			2
lots of @entity144 , @entity0			2
@entity0 says he will be sad to miss @entity8 's race week while he is in @entity2			1

@entity0 is living the high life as he films a *special* *series* of @entity0 in @entity2
this week he attended first @entity37 , a @entity2 *tradition* of a daytime party
was n't long before he and boys were *rubbing* shoulders with cheerleaders
