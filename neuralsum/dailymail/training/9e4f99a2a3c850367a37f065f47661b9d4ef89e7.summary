when faced with someone as spectacularly good as @entity1 on clay you do not require idiots in the crowd calling out as you try and survive a match point in the fourth set			1
that was what @entity10 had to contend with and , just as had happened in losing the 2012 final , he ended with a double fault that completed a 3 - 6 7 - 5 6 - 2 6 - 4 defeat to the man cementing his place as the all time great dirtballer			1
it did not take long for the @entity20 ’s fury to turn to tears as the @entity23 crowd chanted his name when he went to collect the runner ’s up trophy , a duty that the 28 year - old @entity28 has never had to perform			1
the calling out was not why @entity10 lost – that was down to an opponent who currently exercises an unparallelled dominance over one major international sports event			2
@entity1 has now equalled @entity54 ’s record of fourteen @entity56 titles , and is closing in on @entity58 ’s tally of seventeen			1
it may be that his body is the biggest obstacle stopping him from scaling that mountain			0
he was handed the trophy by @entity64 , who he has now usurped by winning @entity23 five consecutive times			2
this triumph was slightly different in what preceded it			0
he lost three times on clay coming into @entity23 this spring – to @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity10 himself – lulling everyone into thinking he was fallible after all			1
there was even anxiety here that his back was starting to hurt as it had done in @entity78 , although he often throws up some concern about his form or fitness @entity82 en route to winning a title			0
at the ready : @entity10 and @entity1 stand and wait for the start of their match trooping the colour : alpha jets of the @entity89 fly over @entity91 court at the start meet me halfway : @entity10 and @entity1 arm in arm posing for photos before the battle commences caption competition : @entity99 passes the suntan lotion to a cohort on a sunny day in @entity102 what he retains is that ability to lift his performance when it most matters , towards the end of tournaments , much to the despair of his one serious challenger on the clay			1
@entity10 , who came in here as the marginal favourite , had beaten him on four previous meetings and believed this was his year to win the one @entity117 lacking from his collection , the thing he wants the most			2
he will be shattered by this , and despite his phenomenal consistency is without a @entity56 title going back eighteen months having lost five out of his last six @entity123 finals			2
the @entity20 is the bookies ’ favourite for @entity127 , where @entity99 may come into his own as coach , but right now there always seems to be someone around to best him			0
devastated : @entity10 looks distraught as @entity1 lifts the trophy - the only @entity56 which eludes him focus : @entity10 was aiming to win his maiden @entity23 title pedigree : whereas @entity1 was trying to win at @entity23 for an unprecedented ninth time emotional : @entity1 drops to his knees and tries to hold back the tears as he wins another @entity23 backing : @entity139 of the @entity28 hold up a banner reading ' @entity141 ' in the stands fish eye : action from the top of @entity91 court as events unfold far below he lamented the fact that his cross court backhand attacking the @entity1 forehand , such a factor in recent victories , was not as effective yesterday as it had been			1
his harder route to the final perhaps also took a toll			0
‘ at the end of the second and the whole third set i struggled a little bit , ” he said “ it ’s not impossible , but it ’s very , very difficult to stay with @entity141 in this court , you know , throughout the whole match on his highest level of performance			0
very hard against him in these conditions over five sets			0
” it all started so well for @entity10 despite the fact that it was another steaming hot day that his opponent would have ordered from the @entity174 for his last two matches			0
the incredible ballstriking that hammered @entity177 on friday was nothing like as deadly accurate , and the @entity20 showed is unique ability to handle those fizzing @entity1 forehand thunderbolts			0
grasp : @entity1 cradles the trophy in his arms as he celebrates his 14th @entity56 victory closing in : @entity10 was also aiming for a career @entity56 after previously winning @entity127 , @entity186 and @entity78 at a stretch : @entity1 extends to reach for a ball during the early exchanges of the match head start : and it was the @entity20 who took the first set 6 - 3 they traded breaks in the middle of the second set only for @entity1 to steal it at the death with a break			1
when the @entity28 leapt ahead in the third his opponent looked to be suffering in the heat and set to capitulate as so many do when faced with this force of nature on clay			2
yet he made a decent contest of it in the fourth , and did not appear in much trouble until serving at 4 - 5			1
as he trudged to the net he gave a sarcastic thumbs up to the heckler			0
it seems strange to think that @entity1 has imploded in the first week of his last two wimbledons			0
he is on the hat - trick ball this time and will know that at 28 he needs to grasp every opportunity going if @entity58 is to be overhauled on the all - time list			2
feeling the heat : @entity1 towels off between points incision : @entity1 displays his bottles with his trademark precision watching on : @entity1 's mother @entity223 ( left ) , sister @entity223 ( centre ) and girlfriend @entity225 ( right ) in attendance leveller : @entity1 roars with approval as he takes the second set to draw the match at one set apiece smile : @entity1 ( right ) and @entity10 ( left ) are presented with their trophies at @entity23 glued to the action : @entity236 , the new coach of @entity177 , was at the match @entity238 : tennis legen @entity64 was also in attendance on @entity240 @entity241 : the @entity20 hopes swapping shirts will help as the game begins to get away from him struggle : and the @entity20 looked as though he was out of it at a break down in the fourth winner : and despite being broken back in the fourth , @entity1 pulled through to claim a superb victory			1

@entity1 beats @entity10 in four sets to claim the @entity23 title
the @entity28 dropped the first set but went on to win 3 - 6 7 - 5 6 - 2 6 - 4
the victory was his ninth at @entity23 and 14th @entity56 triumph
puts him level with @entity54 and just three behind @entity58
