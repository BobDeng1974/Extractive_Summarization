and , according to new research , with good reason			0
scientists have discovered that despite an overabundance of polyester flares and bouffant hair , 1978 was the year that the world 's quality of life peaked , after which it has gradually deteriorated ever since			1
@entity18 experts used a novel method to track the social and economic progress of the world , taking into account various economic , lifestyle - related and ecological factors to come to their conclusion			1
@entity26 ? @entity18 scientists used a novel method to track the social and economic progress of the world , taking into account various economic , lifestyle - related and ecological factors to come to their conclusion that 1978 was the best year until recently the standard method of measuring progress in a society was by assessing its @entity34 ( gdp ) - basically a measure of all the money spent and earned in a given society			1
but , as the new study explained , this has its limits , and can in fact give an inaccurate perspective on the happiness of the planet			0
quality of life : the @entity45 ( @entity45 ) uses economic data as well as statistics relating to pollution , housework and car accidents among other factors			1
the researchers found that @entity45 peaked in globally in 1978 and has steadily declined since then ' gdp was never designed to measure social or economic welfare , and yet , today , it is the most commonly used indicator of a country 's overall performance , ' the study , led by dr @entity54 and dr @entity55 of the @entity57 's @entity56 , said			1
it went on to explain that the most major issue with gdp is that it interprets every expense as positive			0
experts at the @entity57 found that while global gdp - a measure of a economic progress - has increased ( shown in green ) over time , a more complex measure taking quality of life into account , called @entity45 ( pictured in purple ) , in fact peaked in 1978 and never recovered so , for example , an oil spill would be interpreted as a boost to @entity34 because large sums of money would be spent to mount a clean - up operation			1
they explained that ' the [ enjoyable ] act of picking vegetables for your own garden and cooking them for family or friends does not fall into gdp			0
' yet buying a similar meal in a frozen food aisle involves spending money and a in turn results in a gdp increase			0
' popular culture : in 1978 @entity91 enjoyed a number one with single @entity93 ' and actress @entity94 ( right ) was one of the most desirable women in the world @entity98 glory : @entity100 captain @entity99 raises the @entity101 as he is carried shoulder high by fans after @entity100 beat @entity104 3 - 1 in the 1978 @entity105 on home soil they said that a more accurate measure of how a society is faring would need to take a variety of factors - including economy , the state of the environment , and society - into account one alternative measure - and the one they used - is called the @entity45			1
@entity45 starts by using the same figures as gdp , but uses 24 other factors including crime rates , pollution levels , loss of wetland , car accident rates and even the amount of people who volunteer and enjoy housework to give a country its rating			1
the study analysed data collected between 1950 and 2003 and followed 17 countries - equating to half the world 's population - to come to their conclusion			2
they found that on average , where @entity34 steadily increased without interruption , @entity139 peaked in 1978 and has tapered off ever since			1
the 1970s economic crisis , @entity144 's social policy , unemployment and austerity all contibuted to a sudden dip in the @entity148 's @entity45			2
the country has never reached the high of 1978 since the @entity152 's trajectory was similar to the global picture , showing that there was a steady decline in @entity45 from 1978 onwards but that there has been a slight improvement since 2007 experts said the results show that social and environmental problems have cancelled out any monetary wealth the world has accrued			1
' a lot of people working in the field were pretty sure it happened , but it did n't get detected in @entity34 , ' @entity163 of @entity164 , and former head of the @entity166 told the @entity170			0
the study explained that the @entity148 drop could be explained by @entity144 's @entity174 government coming into power in 1970 and cutting social programmes , which continued throughout the @entity178 period			0
the 1970s skyline of @entity180			0
factors used in the @entity45 include cost of air pollution cost of noise pollution personal consumption weighted by income distribution @entity186 of household work and @entity188 of higher @entity189 of volunteer @entity190 of consumer @entity192 of highways and @entity195 of leisure @entity196 of @entity198 of consumer @entity199 of @entity201 of household pollution @entity202 of automobile @entity204 of water @entity206 of air @entity208 of noise @entity210 of @entity212 of forest area and damage from logging @entity215 of nonrenewable energy @entity216 of ozone @entity219 capital @entity223 foreign @entity221 : @entity224 around 1993 , as in the @entity152 , @entity45 did start to increase again , although it has never managed to return to the previous levels reached in the @entity226			1
the @entity152 's trajectory was similar to the global picture , showing that there was a steady decline from 1978 onwards but that there has been a slight pick - up since 2007			0
experts said the @entity148 dip could , in part , be put down to @entity174 prime minister @entity144 's policies the only country to break ranks and experience a perpetual rise until the data ends in 2003 is @entity241			1
however not all experts are convinced by the accuracy of @entity45 , and many do not believe it is the new yardstick by which a society should be measured			2
many believe that there can be no single method of measuring how a society is progressing because there are too many complex factors at play			2
in addition to this , many say it would be foolish to believe that those in developing countries are n't , for the most part , enjoying a better quality of life - in the past 20 years alone world poverty has fallen by 42 per cent			1
' if you look at the broader picture of things that contribute to a quality of life , i think there 's no doubt that the average person in developing countries is better off than in the 1970s , ' @entity262 , chief economist for the @entity264 's @entity263 in @entity265 , told @entity170			2
more generally , life expectancy continues to rise and many surveys in fact say that people are increasingly happy with their quality of life			2
the study concluded that in order to enjoy a ' desirable and sustainable future we need to rapidly shift our policy away from maximising production and consumption ( gdp ) and towards improving a genuine human well - being ( @entity45 ) or similar			0
' this is a shift that will require far more attention to be paid to environmental protection , full employment , social equity , better product quality and durability			0
' the study was published in @entity297			0
and in the @entity148 ...			0

*university* of @entity57 researchers used a novel method to work out when individual countries and the whole world enjoyed the best quality of life
@entity45 ( @entity45 ) uses economic data as well as statistics relating to pollution , housework and car accidents among other factors
found @entity45 peaked in globally in 1978 and has steadily declined since then
the only country to have enjoyed a continually rising @entity45 is @entity241
some experts are *sceptical* about @entity45 and say it is not accurate to use just one formula when assessing world happiness
