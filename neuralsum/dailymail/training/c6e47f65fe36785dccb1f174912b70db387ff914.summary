@entity0 bounced back from two brutal tackles to spoil @entity3 ’s homecoming party			2
the @entity4 , who @entity5 loves so much he ’s signed him four times , embedded himself further in the manager ’s affections with an 88th minute equaliser			0
it will be viewed as a point won for @entity13 but two points lost for @entity15 who led twice and had opportunities to seal victory			1
@entity19 scores his second @entity21 goal of the season ( the other a spectacular solo effort ) to put @entity15 ahead against @entity13 at @entity24 @entity25 did not enjoy the most successful afternoon at @entity24 , and was beaten by @entity26 in the air as the forward provided the assist for the opener @entity13 equalised just before half - time , a corner was met by summer signing @entity33 whose header , with the help of a deflection , found the back of the net @entity13 ( 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 ) : @entity39 6 ; @entity40 5 , @entity33 6.5 , @entity25 5 , @entity41 6 ; @entity42 6 ( @entity43 , 49 6.5 ) , @entity44 5 ( @entity45 34 6 ) , @entity46 7 ; @entity47 8 ; @entity48 6 , @entity49 5 @entity50 : @entity51 , @entity45 , @entity52 , @entity43 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 @entity15 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity56 6.5 ; @entity57 6 , @entity58 ( c ) 5.5 , @entity59 6 , @entity60 5 ; @entity61 6 , @entity62 5 ; @entity19 7 , @entity63 5 , moses 8 ; @entity26 7.5 @entity50 : @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 referee : @entity72			1
@entity5 was full of admiration as he revealed the 30 - year - old took a ‘ massive pay cut ’ to come back to @entity76 , where he also spent last season on loan			2
@entity0 , who played under @entity5 at @entity80 and @entity81 , is thought to have sacrificed £ 6million in wages over two years from @entity83			2
‘ he took a massive cut in wages , ’ said @entity5			0
‘ we pay a third of what he was earning in @entity89			0
he had a massive , fantastic contract in @entity91 and he just wanted to come back here and play football			0
it ’s very rare to see a boy do that			0
’ there was a sense of justice in @entity0 ’s goal after he was twice brutally and illegally felled , first by @entity58 , then by @entity68 , whose lunging challenge resulted in a free kick just outside the @entity15 area — prime @entity0 territory			1
the midfielder , who had come close from range several times , fired into the top right corner			0
‘ he scores those in training all the time , ’ said @entity5 , ‘ he ’s a class player and it was a great free kick after two bad challenges			0
’ there was a sense of justice in the goal for @entity0 who was twice bullied to the deck , first by a bruising @entity58 tackle , then an illegal @entity68 challenge which resulted in a free kick from 20 - yards , prime @entity0 territory			1
both @entity26 and @entity63 attempted to clear @entity33 's header but , ultimately , the poor communication led to @entity26 poking it into his own net @entity26 again gets the better of former @entity130 defender @entity25 , losing his marker and sweeping home a @entity134 cross to restore the lead just as @entity13 seemed to be heading for defeat , @entity0 's excellently - placed free - kick levelled the score with just minutes remaining mins @entity139 @entity13 total 104.8 65.1 @entity0 90 10.5 6.5 @entity33 90 10.4 6.5 @entity40 90 10.4 6.4 @entity15 total 107.2 66.6 @entity26 90 11.1 6.9 @entity140 90 10.9 6.8 @entity19 90 10.5 6.5 data courtesy of the @entity142 , the @entity143 of the @entity21 the striker , who had come close from range several times , fired it into the top right corner			1
@entity5 burst out of his dugout in celebration leaving a stony faced @entity3 to rue what could have been			0
after pulling off an extraordinary victory at @entity154 earlier this season , @entity3 was vying to do the double over his former clubs by winning at @entity24			2
it was an intimidating atmosphere for the 50 year old , returning for the first time since being sacked by owner @entity160 in 2012			0
some @entity13 fans perceive the financial and confidence problems the club currently faces as being a hangover from @entity3 's 10 month stint here			2
the game was just two minutes old when chants of ‘ stand up if you hate @entity3 ’ echoed round the loveable old ground			0
he nearly had the last laugh through goals from @entity19 and @entity26			1
@entity26 showed he is defying the calendar better than @entity25 , who was not as incisive in defence as he is in his recent acerbic autobiography			1
the 33 - year - old striker , not known for his searing speed , outsprinted his former @entity179 teammate and minutes later controversially used him as a climbing ladder to assist the opening goal			2
@entity134 employed what @entity25 might call silky skills to wrong foot @entity40 and send his cross arching into the box			1
@entity26 flicked the ball on for @entity19 to head home from six yards out			1
@entity134 , who wreaked havoc down the wing , set up @entity26 with a peach of an opportunity to extend @entity15 ’s on the half hour mark but his long limbs got in the way and he could not get his shot on target			1
@entity13 had the majority of possession in the opening 20 minutes but lacked the nous to make the most of it			0
their most significant chance was @entity0 ’s sweet left footed shot from 28 yards out which whistled over the crossbar			0
@entity40 , the @entity209 full - back on loan from @entity212 champions @entity211 , tussles for the ball with @entity15 's @entity134 , who is on loan from @entity216 @entity48 made his home debut for @entity13 after coming on as a second - half substitute against @entity130 in the 4 - 0 defeat at @entity220 but @entity13 captain @entity44 did n't last long , @entity5 subbed him off mid-way through the first half after the former @entity223 man picked up an injury their breakthrough came on 42mins when @entity26 helped @entity33 ’s goal into the top corner of the net , getting in the way of teammate @entity63 who was poised to make a goal line clearance			1
@entity13 ’s two new imports from @entity234 teamed up for their goal			2
@entity33 , bought from @entity234 for £ 8m this summer , got on the end of a cross from @entity42 , heading towards the bottom right corner from close range			0
@entity134 was again on point for the second goal , opening up the @entity13 defence like his biblical namesake parted the red sea			1
the @entity245 international shrugged off @entity40 and his pinpoint cross found @entity26 , unmarked in the box and able to direct into the goal with his right foot			2
@entity15 , who hold the unwanted record of being the team last on @entity254 the highest number of times , did everything to ensure a shake up in the running order , with exciting counter-attacking football and @entity13 contributed with persistent attacking			1
‘ the overriding emotion is disappointment , ’ said former @entity13 boss @entity3			0
‘ we allowed them back into the game and it should have already been too far away from them			0
’ despite a questionable record that has seen @entity13 relegated once before under @entity5 , the @entity270 's manager revealed he was likely to sign a new contract soon @entity26 demonstrated a rare turn of pace to beat @entity25 down the line and compound the former @entity130 man 's terrible afternoon @entity3 was not given a warm reception upon his return to @entity13 , he recently described his time there as his toughest period as a manager the battle between @entity26 and @entity25 was a feature throughout the game , with @entity5 's summer signing consistently failing to get the better of his man @entity48 , on loan from @entity287 , failed to impress at @entity24 with @entity5 admitting that the @entity209 does not speak a word of @entity289 @entity13 's manager said that @entity40 was in a similar position to @entity48 in terms of his @entity289 , and that the two players only spoke to each other @entity15 captain @entity58 puts in a heavy challenge on @entity296 , who cut a frustrated figure for much of the afternoon former @entity299 left - back @entity41 attempts to put in a cross while being tracked by @entity19			1

@entity302 drew with @entity13 2 - 2 in their @entity21 match at @entity24
@entity19 scored his second goal of the season to put @entity15 ahead
but @entity13 equalised just before half time through a @entity33 header
although it appeared as though @entity26 actually got the final touch to put it into his own net
@entity26 scored early in the second half to put *visitors* 2 - 1 up , @entity134 provided the assist
@entity0 scored late equaliser
@entity25 had poor *performance* for @entity13
