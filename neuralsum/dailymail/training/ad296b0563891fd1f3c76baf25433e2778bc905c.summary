at least one species of the giant plant - eaters had a head crowned by a fleshy cock 's comb			2
scientists identified it in a rare mummified fossil of one of the dinosaurs which preserved impressions of soft tissues			1
a reconstruction of the duck - billed dinosaur @entity19 , showing its ' cock 's comb '			1
scientists identified it in a rare mummified fossil of one of the dinosaurs which preserved impressions of soft tissues ' until now , there has been no evidence for bizarre soft - tissue display structures among dinosaurs , ' said lead researcher dr @entity32 from the @entity33 in @entity34			1
' these findings dramatically alter our perception of the appearance and behaviour of this well - known dinosaur and allow us to comment on the evolution of head crests in this group			0
' ' it also raises the thought - provoking possibility of similar crests among other dinosaurs			2
' he added : ' an elephant 's trunk or a rooster 's crest might never fossilise because there 's no bone in them			0
this is equivalent to discovering for the first time that elephants had trunks			1
' the mummified specimen , from the species @entity19 , was found in rock deposits near the city of @entity63 in @entity64 , @entity65 the @entity66 was one of the last surviving dinosaurs			1
it was a plant - eater , probably living on a diet of trees and shrubs			0
it had about 1,000 teeth			0
pictured is a fossil of its skull the @entity66 was one of the last surviving dinosaurs			2
it was a plant - eater , probably living on a diet of trees and shrubs			0
researchers believe it had about 1,000 teeth			0
it was a slow - moving dinosaur with few defences , but may have had keen senses to help it avoid predators in its swampy habitat			0
@entity19 is a genus of crestless hadrosaurid - also known as the duck - billed dinosaur			1
duck - billed dinosaurs , described as ' gentle giants ' , roamed @entity93 between 65 and 75 million years ago and grew to about 40 feet in length			1
they were @entity93 's most common dinosaur , filling the same ecological niche occupied by antelopes and deer today			0
fossils of the @entity101 have been found in western @entity93 , including @entity102 , @entity103 , and @entity64 , @entity65			2

the mummified specimen , from the species @entity19 , was found in rock deposits near the city of @entity63 in @entity64 , @entity65			1
scientists were excited when they found evidence of skin impressions			1
but nothing prepared them for what was to come			0
' we have lots of skulls of @entity19 , but there are no clues on them that suggest they might have had a big fleshy crest , ' said dr @entity32			1
' there 's no reason that other strange fleshy structures could n't have been present on a whole range of other dinosaurs , including @entity131 or @entity132			0
' the discovery is reported in the latest issue of the journal @entity136			0
in roosters and other birds , bright red crests are used to attract mates and deter rivals			0
the dinosaur 's crest may have performed a similar function , the scientists believe			0
' we might imagine a pair of male @entity19 sizing each other up , bellowing , and showing off their head gear to see who was the dominant male and who is in charge of the herd , ' said dr @entity32			1
