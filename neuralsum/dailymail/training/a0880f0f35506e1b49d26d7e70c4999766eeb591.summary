by @entity0 published : 06:17 est , 17 march 2012 updated : 08:01 est , 17 march 2012 ‘ @entity5 detectives ’ could be brought in to trace owners who allow their dogs to foul in public places			1
council bosses in @entity7 are in discussions with a forensic vet over plans to dna - test dog faeces which could then be traced back to the canine culprits and their owners			1
the scheme has been used effectively in some @entity16 countries and the @entity17 and is seen as a possible option to help tackle the growing problem of dog - fouling in the south @entity7 borough of @entity22			1
@entity23 ? dog fouling has become such a problem in @entity22 in @entity7 that the council wants to set up a dna database so that canine culprits can be traced last year @entity22 council voted to call on the government to increase the maximum fixed penalty notices for dog fouling from £ 75 to £ 1,000			1
councillor @entity32 , who proposed the scheme , said he was then contacted by the vet after reading about the story but insisted talks are still at an ‘ early stage ’			1
if given the go - ahead , it would be one of the first schemes of its kind in the country			1
@entity45 , who is chairman of the council ’s overview and scrutiny committee , said : ' i am led to believe there are only two of these vets in @entity53 and they work by analysing the samples and identifying the dog by @entity26			1
' it ’s something that has been used in tourism hot spots on the continent and is something they are looking to get a foot - hold of here in @entity64			2
green and pleasant land : the scheme has already been rolled out on the continent to preserve the beauty of favourite tourist spots ' i will be talking to the vet to find out how feasible that will be			1
i do n’t know what it would cost			2
it would probably rely on some database and we would need to find out if it is feasible			2
' it might be that it ’s unrealistic and cost too much or rely too much on voluntary information from the public			2
' we have only had preliminary talks and nothing has been signed and sealed			0
' similar schemes in the @entity17 and @entity86 have relied on a dna database with either fur or saliva samples being taken from dogs in a local area			1
any dog faeces found in public places are then tested and cross-checked against the dna database to identify the offenders			0
@entity96 , former president of the @entity97 and a practising vet , said current @entity53 legislation would make it difficult to introduce a dog dna database			0
bag it , bin it or take it home : @entity22 council wants to be able to fine dog - owners who let their dogs foul in public places up to £ 1,000 he said : “ it is possible to identify dogs from a faeces sample but you need to have a database with all the dogs in the area to identify a particular dog			0
' it sounds fine in principle but there are questions about where the database would be held and who would fund it			0
' if somebody has seen a dog fouling and wants to report a particular dog you would need to take a sample and that would require the owner ’s consent			0
i am not aware of any legal framework that would allow this to happen			0
' the proposals are the latest in a series of measures being taken by the council to help tackle the amount of dog mess littering the streets			0
pcsos are being urged to issue dog fouling fines and extra dog warden patrols have been arranged			0
a @entity146 was also held in december in the nearby picturesque village of @entity148 , during which thousands of dog waste bags were handed out around the village .			0

the scheme is already used in some @entity16 countries and in the @entity17
