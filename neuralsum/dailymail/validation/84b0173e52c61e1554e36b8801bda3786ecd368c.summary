it may be handy for killing vampires , but garlic can keep humans alive in more ways than one , researchers have found			2
they say a nutrient in garlic offers the brain protection against ageing and disease			1
it could even prevent age - related neurological diseases such as @entity14 's and @entity15 's			1
the @entity18 researchers found a carbohydrate in the superfood is key			0
' @entity26 is one of the most widely consumed dietary supplements , ' said @entity28 , associate professor of pathology and anatomical sciences at the @entity31 and lead author of the study			0
' most people think of it as a ' superfood , ' because garlic 's sulfur - containing compounds are known as an excellent source of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory protection			1
a thousand year - old potion made out of onions , garlic , wine and bile from a cow 's stomach can kill hospital superbugs , scientists claim			1
the potent 10th century brew - used by @entity52 to treat a stye ( an abscess on the eyelid ) destroyed 90 per cent of the bacteria on scraps of skin taken from mice with @entity60			0
interestingly , the ingredients had little effect unless they were all brought together into the concoction , the study by @entity63 researchers found			0
' scientists are still discovering different ways garlic benefits the human body , ' he said			2
' our research focused on a carbohydrate derivative of garlic known as @entity76 and the role this nutrient plays in protective responses			1
' @entity28 's team looked at the nutrient 's ability to inhibit ― and even possibly reverse ― brain cell damage caused by environmental stress			1
environmental stress could include the aging process , smoking , pollution , traumatic brain injury or excessive alcohol consumption			2
' microglia are immune cells in the brain and spinal cord that are the first and main line of defense in the central nervous system , ' @entity28 said			2
' unlike other mature brain cells that seldom regenerate themselves , microglial cells respond to inflammation and environmental stresses by multiplying			2
' by massing themselves and migrating toward an injury site , they are able to respond to inflammation and protect other brain cells from destruction			2
' however , increasing the number of microglial cells wo n't provide age - defying protection for the brain , @entity28 said			1
in fact , it can do more harm than good			0
' although important to brain cell health , microglial cells also produce nitric oxide in reaction to their function as protectors , ' @entity28 said			0
' if we simply increased the number of microglial cells , we also would increase the amount of nitric oxide in the brain			0
' excessive production of nitric oxide leads to brain cell damage and promotes neurodegenerative diseases such as cerebral ischemia , parkinson 's disease and alzheimer 's disease			1
however , the @entity132 may provide an answer to this reactive dilemma			0
@entity28 's team looked at the nutrient 's ability to inhibit ― and even possibly reverse ― brain cell damage caused by environmental stress			1
by creating a cell model of neurological stress and monitoring microglial cell function , @entity28 's team was able to study @entity76 's contribution to brain health			1
' when stress was applied to the model , there was an expected increase in microglial cells and their byproduct , nitric oxide , ' @entity28 said			0
' however , once we applied @entity76 , the microglial cells adapted to the stress by reducing the amount of nitric oxide they produced			0
' additionally , @entity76 promoted the production of antioxidants , which offered protective and healing benefits to other brain cells			0
' this helps us understand how garlic benefits the brain by making it more resilient to the stress and inflammation associated with neurological diseases and aging			1
' in the future , @entity28 and his colleagues hope to study the effects of @entity76 on other cells in the body associated with conditions such as heart disease , diabetes and cancer .			0
