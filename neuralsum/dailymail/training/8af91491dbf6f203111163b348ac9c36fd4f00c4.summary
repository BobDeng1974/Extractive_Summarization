the pilots of a @entity2 flight from @entity3 to @entity4 declared an emergency soon after takeoff tuesday when they began having trouble controlling their @entity8 757			1
flight 2116 safely returned to @entity3 after circling off the @entity11 coast for about an hour to burn fuel			1
there were no reports of injuries among the 152 people on board			0
one passenger , @entity18 , revealed that everyone on the plane was ' unnerved ' and that some were in ' tears			1
' scroll down for audio the @entity8 757 , right , sits parked after making an emergency landing at @entity3 the boring 757 touched down safely an hour after it took off from @entity3 ' it was almost like we were on the water , on a boat , ' @entity18 told @entity30			1
' the higher we got , it kind of got worse			0
' within minutes of takeoff , the crew calmly declared an emergency and an unidentified person in the cockpit explained , ' we got a yaw problem , and we 're having a little trouble controlling the airplane , ' according to recording on liveatc.net , an independent website that monitors and posts communications between pilots and air traffic controllers			2
@entity44 refers to the left - or - right movement of an aircraft 's nose , and controlling it is important to avoid not just the feeling of sliding but also a more dangerous problem called a @entity52 roll â€” an exaggerated tail - wagging , rocking motion that can lead to a total loss of control			0
pilots said that it 's not unusual for a crew to declare an emergency and cut short a flight , but the @entity2 pilot 's comment that he did n't have full command of the plane made tuesday 's incident more serious			1
' any time you have a flight - control problem in a commercial airplane , it 's an emergency , ' said @entity72 , a former military and airline pilot			2
a look at the plane 's route as it tried to burn of fuel before landing the plane took off at 8.39am , and the tracking website @entity80 showed it making arcing turns about 5,000 feet above the @entity83 before returning			2
during that period , the crew told air traffic controllers they wanted time to speak with @entity2 officials			0
' if it was a super emergency , he would n't burn down fuel			0
he 'd just come down and bang it on the ground , ' said @entity92 , a former pilot and aviation safety instructor at the @entity94			0
but if the pilots could maintain control , the prudent course was to burn fuel to get to a proper landing weight and return to ' get it back to maintenance and figure out what it was before taking it any further , ' @entity92 said			1
upon touching down shortly after 9.30am , the plane rolled back to a terminal , followed across the airfield by emergency vehicles			0
in an emailed statement , @entity2 called the problem ' a potential systems issue ' without elaborating			1
a spokesman , @entity112 , said it was ' too soon ' to get into more detail and that the airline was focused on rebooking customers on other flights .			0
