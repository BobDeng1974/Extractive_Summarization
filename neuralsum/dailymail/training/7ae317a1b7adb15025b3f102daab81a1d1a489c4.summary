by @entity0 it boasts that it has the most ' intriguing ' display of wax sculptures - and that 's certainly not a false advertisement			1
but it seems the creations at the @entity8 of the @entity9 might be intriguing for all the wrong reasons			0
visitors to the museum in @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , might find themselves not only trying to work out which waxwork they are looking at , but trying to cast their mind back to the film in which they starred			1
while many big stars are featured in the display , they are either unrecognisable in their wax forms or are from films which they starred in during the 1990s			2
the exhibition does feature scenes from classic films , including the likes of @entity66 from the @entity67 and @entity68 in @entity69			0
but the display also includes an unrecognisable version of heartthrob @entity23 as @entity72 in @entity26 , as well a confusing version of @entity74 in @entity75 - despite him having starred in several more blockbusters since that film was made in 2002			1
and those hoping to catch a glimpse of @entity40 might be confused - because she has been mocked up as @entity41 , a role she played as youngster on the @entity83			0
the exhibition also features a questionable version of @entity44 and @entity45 - despite it being home to the ' stars ' from the ' movie and entertainment world '			2
@entity90 as @entity91 and onscreen legend @entity92 - in no specific role - are arguably two of the more life - like models at the waxwork exhibition joke - r ? @entity97 as he starred in @entity98 - in 1989 - pictured left , while @entity99 is given a spot - but using @entity101 from the 1978 film @entity103 and @entity104 are on display at the museum for their parts in @entity108 , made in 2001 , while a baffled - looking @entity109 is shown in his seminal role as @entity111 - one of the biggest films of the nineties other odd - looking models include @entity115 in @entity116 , @entity109 in @entity111 and @entity117 as @entity118 from the @entity119			1
and the reviews on @entity121 will not have done much to boost the curator 's confidence			0
one review said he and his guests had a great time at the museum - because they could not stop laughing at the adaptation of the famous characters			0
another person said it was ' comical ' to look at the models , which looked ' nothing ' like the real people , while one reviewer described it as ' by far the worst wax museum i 've ever visited anywhere in the world '			0
who 's there ? a barely recognisable @entity144 is featured from the 2002 film @entity75 , while @entity68 is given a spot for his role in @entity69 the odd - father : a confused - looking @entity66 is one of the waxworks on display for his role in @entity67 @entity117 as an expressionless @entity118 and @entity152 as @entity153 from the @entity119 , left , while what appears to be @entity155 is pictured right @entity157 as he starred in @entity158 is one of the more life - looking characters at the museum - which reviewers have said is a ' laughable ' collection of waxworks a young - looking @entity115 and @entity165 star in a a scene in @entity116 , left , while the @entity168 is given a spot for his ' numerous ' tv appearances , right the @entity47 at @entity13 , @entity15 , has received mainly bad reviews on @entity121 , with one saying the models looked ' nothing like ' their characters			1

models include an unrecognisable @entity23 in @entity26 and even @entity44 and @entity45
the museum in @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , *promises* it has the most ' intriguing ' display of wax sculptures
