his mother took it upon herself to pen a letter to @entity8 's classmates on his behalf i laugh every time i think i ’m never going to talk to you again because it sounds like the stupidest thing in the world			1
how can i exist in a world that does n’t include you ? i miss the sound of your voice			2
your wrecked skater shoes thrown all around			2
the smell of your incense on your ratty sweat shirt			2
i will be longing for you as long as i live			2
this time of year feels so heavy			1
the two - year mark of your departure ( who the * * * * can call that an “ anniversary ” ) is coming , and the dread had set in before i even turned the calendar page			1
i still wake up e-v - e - r - y - s - i - n - g - l - e - m - o - r - n - i - n - g to the newfound realization that you are dead			1
i relive the panic and the disbelief that you could already be gone this long			0
gone to where we can not follow , until i have finished all of my days			0
and yet life — this life , at least — keeps chugging along			1
most of your high school friends are graduating , @entity8 , and it ’s not that i begrudge them their milestones			1
it ’s just that on top of missing you , i am missing yours			0
so ... by way of channeling my grief into something positive , i dare write a letter to your classmates finishing college ... dear friends , to all of you becoming teachers , neuroscientists , musicians , doctors , artists , lawyers , lions , tigers , and bears — ( oh , my ! ) — becoming adults			1
how lucky you are to have the venerable privilege of finishing college			1
of standing on the cusp of adulthood with the world wide open and ready for your contributions			0
for the utter gift of your presence here among us			0
your presence in the present			0
have you any idea , really , how extraordinary just that fact alone is ? how the very breath you ’re taking without paying any mind to it is a blessing denied to many ? close your eyes for at least one minute each day			0
count 60 breaths and marvel at the preponderance of possibilities before you			0
then vow when you open your eyes to remember , for a moment , that tomorrow is not a guarantee			0
do n’t let that thought paralyze you			0
i ’m not saying do n’t plan for a future that might never come			0
but use the fragile nature of our every day to propel you to always , always , always			0
choose dreams over doldrums , adventure over avarice , memories over money , friends over			2
heck , over everything else			0
speaking of memories and friends			2
never pass up the opportunity to make some of each			0
embrace their gifts and treasures			0
memories can bring happiness or sadness , but because they are a part of you they can not be taken away			0
the mistakes you ’ll make , the bosses and jobs you ’ll hate , the mentors and jobs you ’ll love , the wrinkles you ’ll grow , the babies you ’ll birth , the years you will live — the - years - you - will - live			2
give love and receive love			0
love is the only thing known to survive death			0
if you feel it , say it			0
@entity239 can heal from unrequited love , but not from regret			0
look up from your digital gizmos and look into each other ’s eyes			0
be present with each other — and with the unknown			0
stand long enough to actually hear the answer to “ how are you ? ” sit long enough to ponder the answer to “ who are you ? ” be happy , pig - in - * * * * happy , for what you have			2
even when you have little			0
or when you think you have little			0
because just by graduating from college and reading this missive you have so much more than most people on the planet will ever have , or have ever had			2
@entity261 to be happy , fall in love , fall out of love , ride a bike , fall off a bike , get back on , write a song or symphony , paint a painting , pop a wheelie , stand in awe			0
