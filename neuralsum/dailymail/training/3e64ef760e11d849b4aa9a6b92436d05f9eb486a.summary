@entity0 announced that it will quarantine foreigners for 21 days over fears of the spread of the ebola virus , even though no cases of the disease have been reported in the reclusive country , or anywhere in @entity9 , and very few foreigners are allowed to enter			1
@entity0 is always on guard against outside influences , but now that it perceives the deadly disease to be a threat , its anxiety has reached a new level			1
it has banned tourists , put business groups on hold and is looking even more suspiciously than usual at every foreign face coming across its borders			2
case in point : when a high - level delegation from @entity28 arrived in @entity29 this week , two of the first people they met were dressed in full hazmat gear			1
nothing left to chance : medical personnel in protective suits stand by an ambulance at the @entity36 , in @entity29 , on monday the steps also send a message to the @entity0 people to be very afraid of the outside world and of outside influences			1
an announcement distributed thursday to diplomatic missions in @entity29 said that , regardless of country or region of origin , all foreigners will be quarantined under medical observation for 21 days			0
foreigners from affected areas will be quarantined at one set of locations , while those from unaffected areas will be sent to other locations , including hotels			0
the staff of diplomatic missions and international organizations will be allowed to stay in their residences			0
tourist visits to @entity0 were halted last week , so few were likely to still be in the country			1
@entity0 announced that it will quarantine foreigners for 21 days over fears of the spread of the ebola virus			1
pictured is the @entity70 in @entity29 foreigners from affected areas will be quarantined at one set of locations , while those from unaffected areas will be sent to other locations , including hotels			0
pictured is the @entity76 in @entity29 most tourists do not stay for 21 days			0
it was unclear if they or others already in @entity0 on shorter stays , for example on business , would have to remain for the quarantine period			1
@entity0 's frantic response to the @entity86 outbreak , including the broad but so far poorly defined ban on foreign tourism , is also surprising because it admits so few foreigners at all			1
other than diplomatic and government missions , it has virtually no contact with any of the countries that have been most affected in west africa , though @entity93 is one of the places it has tried to develop good relations			0
@entity98 , the head of @entity0 's parliament , is now touring the continent , though not @entity86 - impacted areas			1
the strict measures shed some light on how the bureaucracy in @entity0 tends to work , and on the isolated country 's often - fearful views of the outside world in general			1
last week , after rumors began to circulate among the small foreign community in @entity29 that draconian measures were in the offing , @entity0 's state media announced that travelers and cargo would be subject to stricter monitoring at airports , seaports and railway border crossings			1
@entity120 reports are being broadcast on television news and during evening programming to increase public awareness of the disease and its symptoms			0
@entity0 's @entity126 aired a news story on sunday that showed quarantine officials strengthening inspections of people and boats moving in and out of the port city of @entity133			1
' our army , which protects our borders , has a high responsibility to block the disease , ' @entity134 , director of the @entity133 inspection center , told the network			2
' we are strengthening quarantine education and thoroughly inspecting boats and planes to ensure that not even a single person carrying the disease enters our country			0
' so far , there has been no official statement in @entity0 's english - language media outlining the tourism ban or other restrictions on travel			1
there was , and remains , little information about what groups are affected , whether travel out of @entity0 will be stopped and under what conditions the restrictions would be lifted			1
that , of course , has left potential travelers scratching their heads - and businesses bleeding money			2
@entity0 's frantic response to the @entity86 outbreak , including the broad but so far poorly defined ban on foreign tourism , is also surprising because it admits so few foreigners at all ' it was poorly communicated , ' said a post monday on the website of the @entity171 , a @entity172 - based organization that specializes in promoting business and educational exchange with @entity0			1
' this did n't allow stakeholders time to prepare for it			0
for @entity171 , we could be seeing potentially tens of thousands of dollars of losses as we delay training programs , and possibly even more as this drags on			0
' for businesspeople , a shutdown will likely hurt their investment plans or transactions			0
' @entity186 , a @entity187 - based travel agency that specializes in tours to @entity0 , already had informed potential customers that tours have been halted , and that anyone coming to @entity0 from certain areas may be quarantined			1
the new quarantine announcement - though slim on details - suggests a much broader response			2
a copy of the document , dated wednesday and issued by @entity0 's @entity198 , was obtained by @entity199			1
more than 13,700 people have been sickened in the @entity86 outbreak , and nearly 5,000 of them have died			0
nearly all the cases are in @entity203 , @entity204 and @entity205 , though there were 20 in @entity207 , four in the @entity187 and one each in @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity211			0
@entity186 says it believes the ban on tourists is just temporary - and is holding out hope that they may be able to return in december			2
@entity0 's reaction is n't unprecedented			2
it closed its borders for several months in 2003 during the scare over @entity219			0
but that was a much more obvious threat			0
@entity219 affected @entity221 , and @entity222 is where most flights into @entity29 originate			0
in the case of @entity86 , @entity0 's efforts to defend itself from what appears to be a tiny risk may end up alienating it from foreigners who have been willing to invest here			2
' overall , this episode seems to reflect two things			0
first , a callous attitude toward stakeholders in the country 's development stemming from poor communications or the lack of will to communicate , ' said the @entity171 blog			0
' second , that @entity0 's ` fear of the foreign ' outweighs their interest in whatever benefits foreign investment brings			2
