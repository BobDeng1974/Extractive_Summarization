potholes on the roads could be a thing of the past if a futuristic plan to produce self - healing concrete comes to fruition			0
the concrete would produce bacteria to fill the cracks when the concrete gets damaged			1
it is one of the innovative schemes outlined in a report on the future of highways by engineering company @entity16			1
the ' self - healing ' concrete would produce bacteria to fill in the cracks when the highway gets damaged ( file picture ) the report looks at possible trends up to 2050 and also envisages the replacement of conventional road surfaces with solar panels that could charge electric vehicles and melt snow			1
temperature - sensitive paint on the roads could generate giant snowflake - shaped warnings to indicate a drop in temperature and icy conditions			0
@entity16 predicts that patterns of ownership will change in the coming years , with commuters more likely to purchase access to a vehicle rather than the vehicle itself			2
the numbers cycling and walking are likely to increase and electric cars could become commonplace , with developments in science dramatically improving performance			0
fully automated navigation systems could enable roads to be populated by driverless cars which could change the design and operation of highways , and provide safety and environmental benefits			0
the report also suggests that improved communications will make cars more ' intelligent ' and ' self - aware ' of traffic levels , speed , weather and potential safety hazards			2
@entity16 's global highways business leader @entity64 said : ' while temperature - sensitive paint and solar surfaces may seem far - fetched , the innovations envisioned in this report are already being tested and piloted around the world			1
' they will change the way that we approach mobility and freight transport and will provide safer , more reliable and more environmentally friendly highway infrastructure for generations to come			0
' he went on : ' @entity81 traffic and control systems will make our roads safer and more sustainable			0
' the report also envisages the replacement of conventional road surfaces with solar panels that could and melt snow ( file picture )			1
