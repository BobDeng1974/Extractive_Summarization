but he seemed particularly taken with the six - petal diamond flower brooch that the @entity9 wore to the @entity10 yesterday – and with very good reason			1

their role was to be the first to acclaim the new @entity100 with ‘ @entity101 ’			0
the roses in the posy that the @entity9 will carry at the service are being flown 5,500 miles from @entity105 – because home - grown buds have been held back because of the coldest spring in @entity79 for 50 years			2
