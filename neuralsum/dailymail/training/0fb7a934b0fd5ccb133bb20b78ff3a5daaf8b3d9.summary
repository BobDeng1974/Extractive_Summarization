@entity0 condemned ‘ lah - dih - dah , airy - fairy ’ criticism of the @entity3 and @entity4 intelligence services last night			1
the prime minister said his fellow @entity7 leaders should stop complaining about snooping by @entity8 and the @entity9 because @entity3 spies have saved their citizens from terrorist attack			1
and in a clear assault on the @entity14 , he accused whistleblower @entity15 and ‘ newspapers helping him ’ , of giving assistance to terrorists ‘ who want to blow up our families ’			1
@entity28 sources said he was given a ‘ hard time ’ because @entity7 leaders believe @entity3 spies were passed intelligence on 35 world leaders who were victims of eavesdropping by the @entity9			1
the prime minister flatly refused to say whether he has seen transcripts of mrs @entity25 ’s conversations			1
she has called the bugging operation ‘ not on ’			2
mr @entity0 was also put on the spot over claims by @entity15 that the @entity8 listening station in @entity53 listened in on @entity55 politicians after tapping into fibre optic cables in @entity57			1
@entity55 premier @entity58 said before the meeting : ‘ it is inconceivable and unacceptable that there should be acts of espionage of this type			0
’ but mr @entity0 rejected the criticism			2
asked directly about claims of the @entity3 spying on @entity55 , the prime minister said : ‘ the first priority of a prime minister is to try to keep your country safe and that means not having some lah - dih - dah , airy - fairy view			1
it means understanding that intelligence and security services do an important job			0
row : mr @entity0 backed the call for talks with the @entity80 by @entity26 's chancellor @entity25 after it emerged her own mobile had been tapped ‘ we need those people			1
they are brave people who help to keep us safe			0
i ’ve lost count of the plots that i ’ve seen being avoided by the work that they do			0
‘ that is important , not just for @entity3			0
they actually help to keep people safe in other @entity92 countries too because we share so much intelligence and information with our @entity7 partners			0
i make no apology for that			0
’ mr @entity0 said those like @entity15 and the @entity14 , which has published details of how @entity8 and the @entity9 operate , are guilty of ‘ helping our enemies ’			1
he said : ‘ there are people in the world who want to do us harm , who want to blow up our families , who want to maim people in our country			2
criticism : mr @entity0 condemned the ' lah - di - dah , airy - fairy view ' of newspapers including @entity14 which published details of the work of intelligence agencies ‘ what @entity15 is doing and to an extent what the newspapers are doing in helping him is frankly signalling to people who mean to do us harm , how to evade and avoid intelligence and surveillance and other techniques			1
‘ that is not going to make our world safer			2
it ’s going to make our world more dangerous			0
’ the prime minister praised @entity3 ’s ‘ very strong , unique , intelligence partnership with the @entity4 ’ and @entity3 ’s spies			1
‘ these are some of the most talented and bright and hard - working and dedicated officials in our country , ’ he said			0
danger : mr @entity0 accused @entity9 whistleblower @entity15 of threatening the work of intelligence agencies in keeping the @entity3 safe ‘ they love our country			1
we should thank them rather than try to make their work more difficult			0
’ mr @entity0 spoke out as security officials in @entity147 revealed that mr @entity0 ’s own calls with other world leaders who were bugged would have been listened to			1
the @entity80 insists @entity4 spies have never targeted the prime minister ’s phones			1
but a security source told the @entity154 : ‘ they would have listened in as matter of course			0
it ’s inevitable that they would have heard some of his conversations			0
’ mr @entity0 ’s counterblast came after he was pressured into signing a statement with other @entity7 leaders expressing concern at the way the @entity4 has been spying			1
they ‘ expressed their conviction that the partnership must be based on respect and trust , including as concerns the work and co-operation of secret services ’			0
@entity3 also went along with a related condemnation of spying between @entity7 nations			0
mrs @entity25 suggested mr @entity0 had bitten his tongue in the meeting , saving his remarks for a post-summit press conference			2
she said : ‘ @entity0 was present at the discussion			2
he was n’t against it			0
’ @entity188 , a former @entity4 ambassador to @entity189 , said @entity7 leaders should n’t be shocked by the revelations of widespread snooping			2
‘ i ca n’t believe anyone is terribly surprised			0
as a government official for many years i assumed that my cellphone and email account were susceptible to spying , ’ he said			0
‘ i do think that this level of outrage is done more for political reasons than real outrage			0
’ @entity201 was behind the hacking of millions of @entity204 phones , not the @entity4 , it was claimed yesterday			1
@entity206 agents are said to have intercepted more than 70million calls and text messages a month			0
until now the @entity204 have blamed the @entity4 , even summoning the @entity4 ambassador to provide an explanation			1
but yesterday ’s @entity212 newspaper said @entity206 was to blame			0
@entity204 first suspected the @entity4 of hacking into former president @entity214 ’s communications network when he was unsuccessfully running for re-election last year			1
intelligence officials went to @entity217 to demand an explanation , but the @entity4 hinted that the @entity201 were to blame , @entity212 said			2
the @entity4 insisted they had never been behind any hacking in @entity204 , and were keen to get on with the @entity204 , whom they viewed as one of their closest allies			1
the article was co-authored by @entity4 journalist @entity226 , whose main contact is @entity9 whistle - blower @entity15			2
he hints that @entity201 was doing the spying and says the @entity9 called @entity206 ‘ the third most aggressive intelligence service in the world against the @entity4 ’ .			2
