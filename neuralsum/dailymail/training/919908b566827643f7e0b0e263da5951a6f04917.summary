flexing its financial might , the political machine backed by billionaires @entity3 and @entity5 on monday told its allies that spending in the 2016 election cyle would hit $ 889 million across its conservative network			1
three major news outlets – the @entity11 , the @entity12 and the @entity13 – reported the ' leaked ' figure almost simultaneously on tuesday morning , along with the @entity16 political newspaper @entity15 , suggesting the uber - wealthy brothers want that gargantuan number out there			2
the @entity20 would put only a small amount of that money on the table themselves : they have patiently cultivated a hush - hush collection of about 450 moneyed conservatives who are expected to carry equal shares of the load			1
the brothers ' @entity30 produces everything from @entity34 cups and toilet paper to jet fuel and fertilizer			1
they 're personally tied for fourth place on @entity40 's list of the wealthiest @entity41 , with assets estimated at $ 41.5 billion each			1
but in the pantheon of individual political donors , the @entity20 are nowhere near the top : they were tied for 24th place , at $ 2 million apiece , among donors to outside spending groups in the 2014 elections			1
@entity52 climate - change hawk @entity50 outdistanced the field with more than $ 73 million			0
@entity5 ( left ) , shown on january 7 at a film gala with tv host @entity55 ( right ) , is a major philanthropist , the principal driving force behind the brothers ' political outreach and spending , and the organizing muscle behind @entity62 , which will put nearly $ 900 million in play during next year 's election season @entity65 ( shown in 2007 ) is at the head of @entity30 and runs the company with an eye toward giving 100,000 a say in management and reinvesting 90 per cent of profits instead of pulling money out micing with liberals : @entity5 ( center ) sat with @entity75 ( left ) and time political columnist @entity76 ( right ) at the time 100 gala in april 2014 in conservative circles , though , they 're without equal in their willingness to organize other wealthy donors to defend the ideal of a limited federal government			1
that 's a value their father @entity85 instilled in them after he spent the earliest part of his career building oil refineries in the @entity91 and became enraged by what he saw as the evils of communism			1
the net result is an $ 889 million political budget planned by @entity62 , the secretive chamber - of - commerce - type group that hosted four potential @entity98 presidential candidates at its weekend meetings in @entity100 , @entity101			2
that amount would dwarf expected spending from official @entity98 committees and many major presidential candidates			0
in the 2012 election , the last time @entity41 elected a president , the @entity108 and the party ’s two campaign committees covering congressional races spent a combined total of $ 657 million			2
news of the hefty budget also suggests that the @entity5 - backed groups are prepared to spend heavily and early to weaken the front - runner for the @entity118 nomination , former secretary of state @entity119			1
@entity5 - backed groups such as @entity121 aired tens of millions of dollars in negative ads against incumbent @entity118 lawmakers in 2014 and helped @entity98 win a majority in the @entity125			1
while the @entity5 - backed groups are tremendously effective , even some of their allies eyed the latest budget figure with wariness			2
former @entity132 gov. @entity131 , a @entity98 who now heads the @entity133 and who calls the @entity20 ' wonderful human beings , ' lamented the ballooning role of outside groups in politics during an @entity13 interview			2
' this is the new normal , ' @entity131 said			0
and fierce political enemies of @entity65 , 79 , and @entity5 , 74 , pounced			2
@entity143 spokesman @entity142 told @entity15 sarcastically : ' wait , you mean a bunch of billionaires are going to spend nearly $ 1 billion in pocket change to try to buy a president to rig the system for them and give them massive tax breaks that no one else gets ? i 'm shocked ! ' @entity155 , a spokesman for the @entity156 , a pac linked to the controversial group @entity157 , told the @entity13 that the @entity20 will ' stop at nothing to purchase a government that grows their profits , weakens pollution standards and maintains tax breaks for big oil			1
' but spending is not a guarantee of success			0
veteran @entity98 operative @entity168 said the massive investment would have little impact if @entity98 lack quality candidates			0
' none of the spending will make a difference unless we have a credible candidate who can effectively lead the country , ' @entity168 said			0
@entity179 sen. @entity178 , a hard - charging @entity98 , told the @entity100 gathering that ' there are a bunch of @entity118 who have taken as their talking point that the @entity5 brothers are the nexus of all evil in the world			1
@entity188 says that every week			0
' ' let me be very clear , i think that is grotesque and offensive			0
' ' i admire @entity3 and @entity5 , ' @entity178 said			1
' they are businessman who have created hundreds of thousands of jobs and they have stood up for free - market principles and endured vilification with equanimity and grace			0
' strange bedfellows : @entity5 posed with conservative flamethrower @entity201 ( left ) and liberal news maven @entity203 ( right ) at the @entity205 gala @entity179 sen. @entity178 , shown saturday at the @entity206 , told the crowd that the @entity20 get a bad rap and are ' patriots ' on the surface , @entity30 appears to embrace values that liberals would applaud			1
the elder brother has trademarked the phrase ' @entity214 , ' a philosophy that he applies to business			0
it calls for giving its 100,000 employees a bigger voice in decision - making , and demands that the company reinvests 90 percent of its earnings instead of pulling profits out for shareholders			1
the net result for the @entity230 , @entity229 company they inherited from their father is the second - largest privately held company in the nation			1
and @entity5 in particular is a philanthropist of the first rank			2
he personally gave $ 100 million to build a theatre at @entity237 in @entity238 , $ 65 milion for a plaza at the @entity240 , and $ 100 million for an ambulatory care center at @entity242			0
but all their spending on conservative and libertarian groups has turned the @entity20 into the men liberals most love to hate			1
' it 's no wonder the candidates show up when the @entity5 brothers call , ' former @entity248 adviser @entity247 told the @entity11			2
' that 's exponentially more money than any party organization will spend			0
in many ways , they have superseded the party			0
' @entity65 thanked his group 's members on saturday night for helping @entity98 win a congressional landslide in november , an event he reportedly called ' an important step in slowing down the march toward collectivism			0
' @entity62 founded a super pac in 2014 , giving the brothers a critical tool to run openly partisan political ads. the trade - off was a rare bit of transparency			2
the super pac spent $ 25 million on the elections , of which trusts controlled by the brothers contributed about $ 4 million			0
@entity62 is the central hub for the @entity5 - backed network that includes groups like the activist - recruiting @entity121 , the millennial - targeting @entity280 and the @entity282 - wooing @entity281			2
but unlike political parties covered by strict campaign finance laws , the @entity5 collection of organizations is mostly made up of nonprofit groups that do not disclose their donors			1
@entity118 have heavily criticized the @entity20 ' spending in politics and lack of transparency			1
a @entity294 for @entity296 analysis of the @entity5 - linked network found $ 407 million in spending during 2012 's elections			1
@entity301 sen. @entity300 appeared at the weekend @entity62 gathering in @entity101 , trying to sell donors on his libertarian brand of noninterventionist foreign policy with an eye toward 2016 @entity307 sen. @entity306 told the @entity5 - backed gathering that @entity309 and left - leaning media outlets exert influence over politics that 's at least equal to what the @entity20 can muster @entity62 ' twice - as - large 2016 budget was included in a monday briefing that @entity62 officials offered a record 450 allies and donors who huddled in @entity100			1
two people familiar with the budget disclosed the sum on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal plans			0
@entity3 and @entity5 typically end their twice - a - year summits with company advisers urging likeminded donors to pledge to open their checkbooks and support their campaigns			1
the events offer donors access to top lawmakers as well			0
for instance , likely presidential contenders sen. @entity300 of @entity301 , sen. @entity178 of @entity179 and sen. @entity306 of @entity307 appeared together for a policy discussion			0
another likely candidate , @entity341 gov. @entity340 , also was on hand			0
@entity306 was asked by @entity344 journalist @entity343 , the forum 's moderator , whether there is ' too much influence in politics by super wealthy donors on both sides			0
' ' as opposed to @entity309 or the mainstream media , you mean , or other multi-million dollar entities that try to influence @entity41 politics every day ? ' @entity306 asked			0
the crowd went wild .			0

@entity3 and @entity5 plan to organize 450 conservative donors into a political force that will rival political parties themselves
the two inherited their father 's oil company , *broadened* it into everything from dixie cups to fertilizer , and grew it into @entity41 's second - largest private company
*favored* @entity118 *punching* - bags , the @entity20 rank just 24th on a list of @entity41 's most *prolific* individual political donors , far behind top liberals
meanwhile @entity30 employs 100,000 people with a philosophy of giving them a voice and reinvesting 90 per cent of earnings instead of pulling profits out
