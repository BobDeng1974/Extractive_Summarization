you then drove her body away in your car			0
@entity57 helped solve her own murder from beyond the grave - by writing diaries where she branded her evil husband ' mr nasty ' ' you have lived all your life in rural @entity91 and were well able to find an isolated place where she has not been found			1

you have even now failed to disclose her whereabouts with all the agony that causes her family and friends			0
' you have shown no remorse because you continue to deny you murdered her			0

mrs @entity57 's nightdress was missing from the house but her glasses , passport , bank cards and a bracelet were all left behind			1
