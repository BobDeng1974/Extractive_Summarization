a freediver managed to catch a 12lb lobster that he reckons could be as old as 70			0
@entity3 , 26 , a biologist , was diving near @entity4 off the @entity6 coast when he found the huge @entity7 lurking on the sea bed			1
a specimen of this size would have been common decades ago			0
but now , as a result of overfishing , the crustaceans rarely weigh in at more 3lbs			1
mr @entity3 caught the lobster on october 6			1
he said : ' i 've been doing this for ten years and i 've never seen a lobster as big as @entity15 - which is his name			1
' i mean any lobster that can bear hug a man must be pretty huge and he had no problem with that			0
' originally i thought he was the world 's biggest lobster but i was just excited - i 'm pretty sure he is the biggest lobster caught off the west coast this year though			1
' they normally only manage to grow to around three pounds because of intensive fishing so it 's really rare to find one this old and big			0
' i won an award from my free diving club last year for bringing in a 9.4lb lobster , so @entity15 has definitely surpassed that			2
' monster of the deep : mr @entity3 holds up @entity15 just after catching him , and right , @entity15 holds mr @entity3 @entity55 : but mr @entity3 resisted the urge to eat @entity15 and instead let him go in a marine reserve @entity59 spiny lobsters are nocturnal and mr @entity3 was on a night dive when he found @entity15			1
pictures show the disconcertingly large crustacean gripping onto to mr @entity3 with its long legs			2
spiny lobsters are distinct from the more - recognisable clawed lobsters , not having the mammoth pincers on their front legs that make the latter so apparently fearsome			0
because they lose all their hard parts each time they moult it is not possible to accurately age them , so biologists make guesses based on the lobsters ' size and weight			0
mr @entity3 took @entity15 home to his family in @entity22 , @entity6 , where he introduced his meaty new friend to the dog			1
' i 've got to say it was very tempting to take him home and eat him - he had pounds and pounds of delicious meat but he was clearly a good breeder , so my family and i decided that we had to put him back into the water so he could have more children , ' mr @entity3 said			0
' we took him to the @entity91 where he was put in a tank and gorged on food but we were not going to leave him in captivity			0
' we put him back into the water in a marine reserve off the coast of @entity6 which does not allow fishing , so he can live out the rest of his days in peace			2

@entity3 , 26 , caught the @entity59 spiny lobster off the @entity6 coast
he named the crustacean @entity15 because of his immense size
nowadays overfishing means @entity15 's peers rarely reach more than 3lbs
