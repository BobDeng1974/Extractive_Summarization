by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 00:04 est , 25 november 2013 updated : 20:46 est , 25 november 2013 top @entity4 diplomats spent months meeting with @entity5 in a series of secret , bilateral negotiations that hammered out most of the details of the nuclear deal with the @entity10 - an agreement that is being criticized by @entity12 and some in @entity13 as giving away too much in exchange for too little			1
the talks , most of which were held in @entity18 , included sitting down face - to - face with representatives from the regime of hardline president @entity22 , the @entity2 has revealed			1
on sunday , @entity12 prime minister @entity23 called the bargain that @entity25 reached with the @entity4 and the five other world powers ' a historic mistake			1
' president @entity28 phoned @entity23 from aboard @entity29 on sunday night in an attempt to assuage his fears			1
agreement : @entity5 foreign minister @entity33 shakes hands with secretary of state @entity35 after the two helped broker an agreement between @entity25 and six world powers the agreement sees @entity25 promising to scale back its uranium enrichment - a key precursor to producing a nuclear weapon - for six months in exchange for receiving $ 7billion in sanctions being lifted			2
@entity23 has long lobbied against the deal because he believes it leaves @entity25 's military nuclear capabilities largely intact , while giving @entity25 relief from painful economic sanctions , undermining negotiations on the next stage			1
' today the world became a much more dangerous place because the most dangerous regime in the world made a significant step in obtaining the most dangerous weapons in the world , ' @entity23 told his @entity59 on sunday			2
@entity12 prime minister @entity23 called the nuclear deal a ' historic mistake ' the one - on - one discussions between @entity25 and the @entity4 were personally authorized by president @entity28 , who has long tried to open up the lines of dialogue between the @entity5 government and the @entity4			1
the talks were kept hidden even from @entity4 's closest friends , including its negotiating partners and @entity12 , until two months ago , and that may explain how the nuclear accord appeared to come together so quickly after years of stalemate and fierce hostility between @entity25 and the @entity73			1
but the secrecy of the talks may also explain some of the tensions between the @entity4 and @entity77 , which earlier this month balked at a proposed deal , and with @entity12 , which is furious about the agreement and has angrily denounced the diplomatic outreach to @entity81			1
the talks were held in the @entity84 nation of @entity18 and elsewhere with only a tight circle of people in the know , the @entity2 learned			2
since march , deputy secretary of state @entity88 and @entity89 , vice president @entity91 's top foreign policy adviser , have met at least five times with @entity5 officials			2
the last four clandestine meetings , held since @entity25 's reform - minded president @entity95 was inaugurated in august , produced much of the agreement later formally hammered out in negotiations in @entity98 among the @entity4 , @entity99 , @entity77 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity25 , said three senior administration officials			1
all spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss by name the highly sensitive diplomatic effort			0
the talks were brokered by @entity110 , the @entity99 - educated monarch of @entity18 who has been careful to maintain good relations to with @entity25 and the @entity73			1
some of the negotiation took place when hardline @entity5 president @entity22 was still in power power broker : sultan @entity110 , who has maintained ties to both @entity25 and the @entity73 , brokered the meetings the deal reached in @entity98 , @entity120 , this weekend is only short - term - just six months			1
negotiators on both sides say that the temporary solution buys them time for a broader , more comprehensive bargain			0
@entity25 will gain about $ 7billion in eased sanctions			0
about $ 4.2 billion will come from oil sales			0
another $ 1.5 billion more would come from imports of gold and other precious metals , petrochemical exports and @entity25 's auto sector			2
in exchange , @entity25 must stop enriching uranium , stop building additional centrifuges that enrich the uranium			0
additionally , its highest - grade uranium - 20percent , which is closest to what is needed to create a nuclear weapon - must be diluted or destroyed			0
however , @entity25 can keep its current stockpile of 16,000 pounds of low - enriched uranium - which takes longer to convert into the material needed for a weapon			0
the @entity143 claims that the six - month halt , combined with the destruction of the higher - enriched uranium , adds two months to the time it could take @entity5 to develop a weapon			0
officials described the first contacts as exploratory discussions focused on the logistics of setting up higher - level talks			0
the discussions happened through numerous channels , officials said , including face - to - face talks at undisclosed locations			1
they included exchanges between then @entity4 ambassador to the @entity162 @entity161 , now @entity28 's national security adviser , and @entity25 's envoy to the world body , the officials said			1
@entity168 aide @entity167 was also involved , the officials said			0
the talks took on added weight eight months ago , when @entity28 dispatched the deputy secretary of state @entity88 , the top aide @entity89 and five other officials to meet with their @entity5 counterparts in the @entity18 capital of @entity176			1
@entity28 dispatched the group shortly after the six powers opened a new round of nuclear talks with @entity25 in @entity181 , @entity182 , in late february			1
at the time , those main nuclear negotiations were making little progress , and the @entity5 had little interest in holding bilateral talks with the @entity4 on the sidelines of the meeting out of fear that the discussions would become public , the @entity4 officials said			1
so , with the assistance of @entity110 , officials in both countries began quietly making plans to meet in @entity18			0
@entity88 , @entity89 and a small team of @entity4 technical experts arrived on a military plane in mid-march for the meeting with the @entity5			0
the senior administration officials who spoke to the @entity2 would not say who @entity88 and @entity89 met with but characterized the @entity5 attendees as career diplomats , national security aides and experts on the nuclear issue who were likely to remain key players even after the country 's elections this summer			0
@entity12 is n't the only @entity4 ally to voice concerns over the deal			2
@entity214 - the @entity216 rival to @entity25 - has long taken a hard line against @entity81 obtaining a nuclear weapon			2
@entity77 , too balked at the terms of the deal - even they that nation was part of the @entity98 talks and eventually signed on			2
in @entity13 , opposition in mounting , as well - from both side of the aisle			0
congressman @entity228 , the @entity229 chairman of the @entity230 , expressed ' serious concerns , ' saying the @entity4 was ' relieving @entity25 of the sanctions pressure built up over years , ' while allowing @entity81 to ' keep the key elements of its nuclear weapons - making capacity			2
' @entity238 @entity237 senator @entity236 said he was ' disappointed ' by the deal			0
' this disproportionality of this agreement makes it more likely that @entity242 and @entity229 will join together and pass additional sanctions when we return in december			0
i intend to discuss that possibility with my colleagues , ' he said in a statement .			0
