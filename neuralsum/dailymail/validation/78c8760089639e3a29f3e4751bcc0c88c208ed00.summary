' i asked the headteacher to elaborate which religions and which cultures ? but he said it had to be confidential			2
he referred us to the formal complaints procedure			0

' pupils at @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 , were banned from watching today 's once - in - a - generation eclipse because of ' religious and cultural reasons ' @entity15 , whose seven - year - old daughter goes to the school , said the decision was like ' going back to the dark ages ' @entity7 , situated in the @entity82 ward of @entity8 in @entity83 , was rated ' outstanding ' in its last @entity85 report in march 2013			1
but this rating was largely attributed to the ' exceptional ' then head teacher @entity87 , who left her post last summer			1
the report said : ' the headteacher provides outstanding leadership based on a clear vision for the school			0
' she has taken staff , at all levels , with her on the road to excellence and this is a tribute to her personal dedication and care for others			0

a friend of mine who is a teacher at the school said she did n't understand it			1
' i think it was quite a last - minute decision			0

maybe it 's some obscure reason			0

and fundamentalists believe that they need to bathe immediately after an eclipse and chant the name of @entity155 to overcome the forces of darkness			0
headteacher @entity108 said he was unable to elaborate on the decision because of ' confidentiality ' the headteacher said : ' the school made this decision when we became aware of religious and cultural concerns associated with observing an eclipse directly			1
' although we are sorry for any disappointment , pupils were still able to watch the eclipse on screens in classrooms			1
however , the overcast conditions in @entity9 today meant they would not have been able to see it live in any case			1
' @entity30 , whose five - year - old daughter @entity31 is a pupil at the school , said : ' there is no cultural reason that i am aware of			1
if that 's what they said then it would surprise me			0
