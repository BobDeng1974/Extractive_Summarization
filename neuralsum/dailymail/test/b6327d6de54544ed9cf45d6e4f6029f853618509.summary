@entity0 became the first jockey in more than 40 years to win back - to - back @entity2 when many clouds galloped to a famous victory in the @entity6 sunshine			1
the 25 - 1 shot , who was sixth in the @entity9 , is the first @entity11 winner to land the prestigious prize and in the process ended his trainer @entity14 ’s wretched record in the race			1
the @entity18 handler had previously saddled four national runners and non of them had even completed the course prior to his eight - year - old ’s hard - fought length - and - three quarter defeat of the gallant @entity24			1
many clouds won the @entity27 's @entity26 at @entity6 for trainer @entity14 ( centre ) and last year 's winning jockey @entity0 winning jockey @entity0 kisses the @entity26 trophy as the 38 - year - old celebrates another famous victory @entity0 , riding national winner @entity34 ( right ) , goes toe - to - toe with second placed @entity36 ( centre ) along the final straight many clouds ( far right ) leaps over the water jump during the @entity26 at @entity6 on saturday afternoon many clouds and @entity0 jump a fence on the way to winning the 2015 @entity26 at @entity6 last year 's winning jockey @entity0 celebrates his victory as @entity34 slows to a halt after the race many @entity49 owner @entity48 ( centre ) celebrates after victory in the @entity27 's @entity52 @entity53 on @entity54 congratulates the winner of the 2015 @entity27 's @entity26 at @entity56 winning horse @entity34 is doused with water shortly after winning the @entity26 in @entity59 ' i just ca n’t believe it , ' said a visibly shocked and elated @entity14 , who along with his wife @entity62 , had ridden in the race prior to taking up training			1
' i was watching and i thought after the first few fences he ’s some spin			0
' all i wanted was the horse to come back in one piece			0
' he was foot - perfect , i do n’t think he made a mistake			0
@entity11 winner and a @entity26 winner – it sounds good does n’t it ! ' the victory continued a remarkable comeback tale for @entity77 who won the world ’s most famous steeplechase 12 months ago aboard @entity80 , just a matter of years after he had announced his retirement from the sport			1
for a long way it appeared @entity86 could provide @entity53 with a fairytale second national triumph before his retirement veteran jockey @entity53 looks dejected after earning a fifth - place finish in his last ever @entity26 the runners are seen off the mark by a capacity @entity6 crowd on saturday afternoon a group of finely dressed female racegoers pose for the cameras on a sunny day at @entity6 , @entity59 the excited masses turned out in full force for all the action at the sun - soaked @entity6 venue the ladies were not afraid of showing a bit of skin in the warm spring sunshine ahead of the festivals final race the @entity109 ’s historic achievement mirrored those of @entity110 who partnered the legendary @entity111 to back - to - back triumphs in 1973 - 74 and his mount also carried more weight than any horse since @entity117 ’s triple national winner			1
@entity0 said : ' it is wonderful			2
many @entity49 has given his all and it is a wonderful training performance by @entity14 ( @entity121 )			1
' he is all heart and gave me the best ride i have ever had over these fences			0
' he was awesome and i was just hoping the battery life would last			0
' a panoramic view of the iconic @entity56 is seen during the @entity128 earlier on saturday afternoon three glammed up crowd members make it a day to remember as they pose for a selfie the crowds were in high spirits throughout the day in anticipation for the big race a picture of legendary jockey @entity53 is seen as racegoers strategise their afternoon 's betting @entity53 is greeted by adoring fans as he arrives at @entity6 for his final @entity26 for much of the race , @entity53 looked poised to go close aboard 6 - 1 favourite @entity86 who travelled and jumped like a dream behind the leaders			1
however , the petrol gauge began to flicker late on and the 19 - time champion jockey was forced to settle for an honourable fifth aboard the eight - year - old			2
' he ran a blinder , he was just a little bit fresh and did n't get home			0
i 'm delighted with him , ' reported @entity53 on dismounting			0
@entity151 , seventh last year , stayed on gallantly into third place to give the race ’s youngest trainer @entity153 another big day in the sun , while @entity156 finished in exactly the same position as 12 months ago to complete an incredible seven timer for rider @entity159 who has now finished in the first four in the last seven @entity2			2
the fancied @entity161 crashed out at the @entity162 on the first circuit , bringing down @entity164 and although there were initial concerns for both horses as the field were waved around the fence on the second circuit , they emerged unscathed as did the rest of their rivals with no fatalities reported			0
the @entity175 was another to crash out when moving strongly at the head of affairs with @entity179 second time round claiming @entity181 ’s charge , while @entity182 was never really travelling with any fluency and faded into 17th			0
bookmakers write out the odds for the horses competing in the @entity26 race on the final day of the festival it was a day out for the whole family for this group as racegoers young and old enjoyed their day out during @entity26			2

many @entity49 wins the 2015 @entity26 after leading @entity53 's @entity194 with one *furlong* to go
however *shutthefrontdoor* tired on the final straight and @entity53 was forced to settle for fifth on his *swansong*
@entity36 came in second after a hard - fought final straight but it was @entity14 's horse that took the glory
jockey @entity0 took his second consecutive national title after his 2014 win with @entity80
40 - 1 shot @entity151 , ridden by @entity208 came in third after a *thrilling* race
