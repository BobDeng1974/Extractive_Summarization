by @entity0 misunderstood ? @entity3 's reputation might be unwarranted and borne out of a basic accountancy misunderstanding , a historian claims he is known as a terrifying warrior and ruthless monarch who conquered the @entity9 kingdom of @entity10			1
but @entity3 ’s fearsome reputation as a murderous tyrant might be unwarranted and borne out of a basic accountancy misunderstanding			0
one historian claims that the problem lies with the definition of the word ‘ waste ’ in the @entity19 , which has been misinterpreted and used to tarnish the warrior king ’s reputation			1
‘ in the winter of 1089 , @entity3 gathered his troops for what would become known as the " @entity29 " , ’ said dr @entity22 , a historian at the @entity24 charity in @entity25			1
‘ having already swept away the @entity9 nobility in the @entity32 , they hoped to do the same in the rebellious @entity34 and the theory goes that they arrived in @entity37 with just one thing on their minds - mass destruction			2
‘ by the time they left a few months later , we have been left with a picture of an entire county devastated			0
‘ there 's no doubt the @entity48 were a fearsome lot , but to blame them for reducing @entity37 to a wasteland is wide of the mark			2
dr @entity22 explained that much of what we know about the episode in @entity37 comes from the @entity19 of 1086			1
compilers of the @entity19 ( pictured ) have written ' waste ' next to many of the @entity37 landholdings and this had led historians to believe that the land was destroyed			1
however , dr @entity22 claims this could n't have been the case and that ' waste ' simply meant the specific lands could not be taxed @entity3 was the first @entity66 king of @entity10 who reigned from 1066 until his death in 1087			1
he famously defeated king @entity69 , as depicted in the @entity71 tapestry			0
@entity3 's final years as king were threatened by rebellions including the invasion of @entity10 by the @entity75 , which led him to respond with violence			0
in 1086 , @entity3 ordered the compilation of the @entity19 , which was a survey of landowners in @entity10 as well as their holdings			2
his reign in @entity10 is marked by many castles and the settling of new @entity84 on the land			0
in the famous book , which records the great land survey of much of @entity10 and parts of @entity90 undertaken so the crown could collect taxes , compilers have written ‘ waste ’ next to many of the @entity37 landholdings and this had led historians to believe that the land was destroyed			1
‘ however , it 's actually much more likely that it means the compilers could n't put a value on the holding , ’ dr @entity22 said			1
he explained that at the time , estates were merged and divided up again so that trying to trace the owner to collect taxes for the king was very difficult			0
‘ the entire invading @entity66 force numbered less than 20,000			1
in the four months they were here , it would have been logistically impossible for them to ravage such a large area			1
‘ to have destroyed the number of settlements listed as “ waste , ” the @entity48 would have had to pillage all day and all night			2
’ another literary source further dented the king ’s reputation a few decades later when scholarly monk @entity117 wrote his own account of the conquest			0
dr @entity22 is keen to restore the king 's reputation and said that while he crushed a rebellion with force , he also left @entity37 some of @entity125 's greatest monuments , such as @entity126 , near @entity127 ( pictured ) the @entity29 was a series of campaigns by @entity3 that started in the winter of 1069 to put down revolts in the north of @entity10			1
at the time , @entity133 invaded @entity10 to support @entity134 the @entity136 's claim to the throne as the last remaining member of the @entity139			0
their combined army broke the @entity66 hold on the north and @entity3 responded by putting down the revolt			2
it is popularly claimed that he systematically set about destroying the countryside and villages of @entity37 , after sending the @entity75 home			2
it has been said that @entity3 slaughtered families and ruined homes , crops and animals so that thousands of people died in a famine			0
a popular interpretation of the @entity19 claims that much of @entity37 was still a wasteland in 1086 - although this is now disputed			1
he wrote : ‘ it was horrific to behold human corpses decaying in the houses , the streets and the roads , swarming with worms			0
‘ for no - one was left to bury them in the earth , all being cut off either by the sword or by famine ... there was no village inhabited between @entity25 and @entity171 - they became lurking places to wild beasts and robbers			0
’ dr @entity22 believes this account is more fiction than fact and is giving a series of public lectures to restore , or at least improve , the king ’s reputation on behalf of the @entity37 environmental charity , @entity24 , which is based at @entity183			1
‘ these accounts were written many years after the @entity29 and need to be taken with a large pinch of salt , ’ he said			0
‘ for centuries since the @entity48 have been cast as the villains of the piece and half - truths and suggestions have appeared as fact in encyclopaedias			0
‘ @entity3 did crush a rebellion with force , but we should n't forget what the @entity48 did for us			2
‘ it was down to them that @entity37 was left with some of @entity125 's greatest monuments , such as @entity126 , near @entity127			0

@entity3 could not have reduced @entity37 to a wasteland , according to @entity25 historian dr @entity22
compilers of 1086 @entity19 wrote ‘ waste ’ next to many @entity37 landholdings and historians popularly think that the land was destroyed
but dr @entity22 believes it probably meant that land could not be valued and taxes could not be collected
would have been ' logistically impossible ' for the invading @entity66 force of 20,000 *soldiers* to ravage such a large area in just four months , he claims
