talk about stealing someone 's thunder			0
@entity2 were forced to shut down the 23rd annual @entity3 when terrifying lightning strikes put spectators at risk			1
however , @entity8 's ferocious rain and cracking thunder could not dampen the festival - goers ' enthusiasm , as a number of determined spectators returned in ponchos to sit in the soggy grass and watch the exhibition			1
each of the short films were required to incorporate the signature item : a mirror			0
after @entity44 's win , the @entity51 filmmaker revealed that he was close to tears about 6pm while on the phone to his dad			0
' i was freaking out big time , when that rain was coming in and when that notice came up on the screen that things were cancelled , ' he told @entity61			0
' i could see the crowd exiting and i just thought , ` you put so much time and effort into this ' and i know it 's an outdoor festival , but you just do n't think it 's going to happen			1
' that 's the least of your worries , the weather			2
' when they arrived , people at the festival were offered an early show , when the sky darkened , lightning cracked across the sky and an intense storm closed in			2
at around 5.30pm , @entity2 and @entity3 organisers announced that the festival , held in @entity81 in @entity8 's east , was ' closed due to very extreme weather conditions '			1
' @entity41 ' was announced the 2014 @entity3 winner ; a dark comedy directed by @entity44 and produced by @entity45 several hundred spectators persisted and returned , wearing ponchos , to watch the short film entrants film fanatics were even warned not to wait in the event tents due to the danger of being struck by lightning , with people warned to move away from metal objects spectators tried to withstand the storm but struggled when they were unable to take shelter , warned by officials to avoid trees and even tents as the vicious storm continued			1
' move away from all metal objects ! do not stand next to the sides of the tent , we 're about to get hit by lightning , ' a spokesman warned the crowd from inside a tent at the festival , according to @entity110			2
the event was closed for more than an hour , meaning many spectators packed up their blankets and picnic baskets and returned home			0
' ca n't make it to # tropfest tonight , but have poured of bucket of water over my head and set up a few leaf blowers to replicate the experience , ' tweeted musician @entity123			0
however , @entity124 prevailed , with organisers tweeting : ' @entity126 try # @entity127			0
we 're back ! ' by the time the event was re-opened , a slightly lack - lustre crowd remained of just ' several hundred '			2
most film fanatics opted to watch the television broadcast on @entity133 from their cosy and , more importantly , dry couches			0
crowds enjoyed themselves nonetheless - although some might have been wishing they were sitting on their warm , dry couches at home the crowd was a sorry sight at the 2014 @entity3 , considering the hype and expectations a very different sight : in 2013 , the first year at the new venue @entity81 , the festival drew in a record - breaking crowd not a person in sight after @entity81 was evacuated by @entity2 a fan on @entity151 explained the situation perfectly , with @ pixelbender83 tweeting : ' i came			1
i returned ! # tropfest 2014			0
' in 2013 , @entity3 drew a record crowd of more than 95,000 people at the @entity8 site alone			1
on average , @entity3 attracts a live national audience of around 150,000 people , with people also attending in other capital ciites around @entity163			0
it was terrible luck , as the festival had been moved from february to december this year after @entity3 had been affected by rainy conditions in previous years			1
only one festival has been cancelled due to wild weather , but @entity124 was notably 2012 after studying weather patterns , the festival 's organisers had decided that december was a much safer option			2
it was a dark and gloomy sight at @entity175 at @entity8 's @entity81 host @entity176 jokes ' first time for everything : # @entity179 ' musician @entity123 is clearly not envious of the drenched crowd at @entity81 ! ' if you look it up , statistically @entity8 has almost double the rainfall in february than it has in december , so i 'm not going to pretend that did n't have something to do with it either , ' tropfest founder @entity181 told @entity61 at the time			1
the soaked spectators kept their sense of humour , taking to social media to make light of the intense @entity8 storm , with a tent at the event jokingly offering free flotation devices to prevent fans from washing away			0
@entity197 tweets for help as the flood rose around her at @entity3 @entity3 entrant @entity200 pleads with brave film enthusiasts to attend , despite the wild weather pool noodle , anyone ? reef reels were happy to help out in any way they can @entity3 and @entity2 both announced that the festival was closed due to dangerous lightning strikes @entity176 , who hosted the event alongside @entity133 ' @entity211 and @entity212 , tweeted a photo to show that to his amusement , he had needed to blow - dry his pants			1
' i assume # tropfest is short for tropical storm festival ' pointed out @entity219 in a tweet			0
' it is like they are doomed by the weather , ' said @entity3 judge , @entity224			2
not defeated ! @entity3 announces the festival is officially reopened after fears of cancellation due to weather before the rain , a beautiful sight as spectators threw paper aeroplanes into the air			1

@entity2 forced to temporarily shut down @entity8 's @entity3 festival
an hour later it was reopened , but much of the crowd had returned to the *comfort* of their dry homes
@entity81 was lashed with extreme weather , *including* dangerous lightning strikes
only several hundred returned , compared to last year 's record - breaking 95,000 - person strong crowds
dark comedy ' @entity41 ' was announced as the 2014 winner
