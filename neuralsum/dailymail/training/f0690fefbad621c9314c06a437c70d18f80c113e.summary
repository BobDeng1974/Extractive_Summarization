spectators at a public rally gasped when @entity8 cuffed @entity9 on the back of the head as the latter addressed the crowd on the @entity13 ' @entity12			1
then as mr @entity9 span on his heels to work out what had happened , the grinning politician made a ' shhh ' gesture before surprising his fellow speaker with a friendly kiss			1
what followed appeared like a pantomime farce as mr @entity9 , representative of the municipality 's disabled people unit , slowly turned the wrong way in an effort to locate his assailant			2
mr @entity8 gestured for people to remain quiet and allowed mr @entity9 to spin a full 270 degrees before halting his search and kissing him on both cheeks , to laughs from the watching crowd			1
the @entity13 warns that people with disabilities are at higher risk of violence , stigma and discrimination			0
so perhaps mr @entity8 , mayor of @entity26 's @entity54 district , was trying to make a clever point			2

the punchline : mayor @entity8 stopped his fellow speaker three - quarters of his way around a full spin and surprised him with a kiss on both cheeks			1

a spokesman for the @entity129 public relations department claimed the pair were ' as close as father and son ' , adding ' this was just a joke			0
