@entity0 wants to make amends for his ugly brawl with veteran @entity4 heavyweight @entity3 by fighting @entity5 in @entity6 this april			1
@entity7 ’s @entity0 has asked promoter @entity8 to lure @entity5 into the fight by offering the @entity11 home advantage			1
be careful what you wish for , @entity0			2
be careful about granting that wish , @entity15			0
slugfest : @entity0 ( right ) lands a big right hand during his win against @entity3 on saturday night unconvincing : @entity0 admitted afterwards that he was ' gutted ' by his performance in the ring @entity5 is not the best heavyweight on the planet but he is dangerous enough to place in jeopardy the final eliminator for a challenge to @entity28 ’s @entity27 title , towards which @entity0 and @entity29 are supposed to be on collision course this summer			1
@entity0 persevered for a lop - sided points win over @entity3 and was man enough , also , to admit that he was ‘ gutted ’ by the deficiencies in his own performance			2
raggedly though he boxed , @entity0 was able to overwhelm the ageing @entity3 with the non-stop aggression which is the most obvious benefit of his rededication to the rigours of the prize - @entity38 is younger , hungrier and as high on work - rate as @entity0			0
his only defeat was to @entity28 himself and of his 26 victories 18 have been inflicted by @entity42 is it all likely that @entity0 would get away in @entity6 with all the rabbit punches to which @entity45 referee @entity44 mostly turned a blind eye in the @entity47 at @entity7 ’s @entity48 on saturday night			1
it is not beyond @entity0 to come home from @entity6 with a win but this fight would be no stroll in @entity54			1
there is a lot of money to be made fighting in @entity11 these days , if perhaps not quite as much as for a slugfest with @entity29 at a @entity7 football ground			0
so although @entity0 is still talking of how ‘ me and @entity29 will still get it on in mid-summer , ’ he may be calculating that a spectacular ko of @entity5 could fast - track him straight to @entity62 that were to happen , @entity29 really would be furious			1
the @entity64 giant fulfilled his part of the elimination bargain by knocking out @entity4 journeyman @entity67 in the co-feature at the @entity47 and is scheduled to return there for another tune - up on april 11			0
he has been expecting @entity71 to do the same			0
that way they could monitor each other ’s @entity74 in re-sharpening his skills , @entity29 in shedding the surplus poundage			0
in the process of getting fight - fit again @entity0 seems to have mislaid his jab and become reliant on round - house swings to the back of the head			2
it 's a knockout : @entity29 ( right ) beat @entity67 in a comfortable return to the ring very heavyweight : @entity29 was visibly carrying excess baggage during his fight at the @entity47 while kept out of action for almost a year by @entity91 ’s double withdrawal from their big - money showdown , @entity29 has put on too much weight even for his 6ft 9in frame			1
he came in on saturday at nigh - on 20 stones , a career high			0
that was ok for a ko against @entity67 in four slam - bang rounds but when it comes to more threatening opposition he needs the motivation to hone down to the 18 stones at which he beat @entity0 in their first encounter			0
@entity29 is a true entertainer and @entity0 can exude menace			2
but if they do complete the elimination journey then whichever of them goes on to challenge @entity28 needs to do so in prime physical condition and razor sharp			0
risky business : @entity5 ( right ) would represent a seriously tough test for @entity0 @entity114 still on course for @entity116 megafight speculation continues to swirl like wild fires in @entity119 about @entity116 ’s next fight , for which @entity114 has signed a contract to meet the world ’s pound - for - pound king on may 3			1
but one piece of conjecture , at least , has been doused by @entity126 , chief executive of @entity127 whose job it is to oversee the organisation of @entity116 ’s mega-million - dollar nights on the @entity132			0
rumour had it that either @entity114 or @entity135 – who the @entity45 fighter has already beaten in the ring , and who was also in @entity116 ’s @entity140 poll to let the fans choose his next opponent - would step down to meet @entity143 on the same bill			1
who 's your money on ? @entity114 is in pole position to fight @entity116 in @entity132 on may 3 bone shuddering : @entity114 rocks @entity135 during his win over the @entity152 in december 2011 @entity126 says : ‘ no , not all			1
i am waiting on @entity116 but have a pretty good idea what ’s going to happen and what the undercard will look like			0
’ for @entity114 , the long wait goes on and he is pondering a quick trip to @entity132 from his training camp near @entity160 this week to seek confirmation			0
@entity162 and @entity164 rematch has already started ... in words @entity164 and @entity162 are both claiming victory in the wars of words and negotiations which are preceding their much - anticipated rematch on may 31			1
it was exactly the same prior to their first world super-middleweight title fight			2
@entity164 says he has forced @entity162 to meet him a second time , with the help of soaring public demand			1
@entity162 says he is doing this for the public , as well as to ‘ stop @entity164 whining ’ about the premature way he was stopped last year			2
no love lost : @entity184 ( left ) and @entity162 ( right ) will go toe - to - toe again - after plenty more fighting talk jaw - dropping : @entity164 ( right ) lands a punch on @entity162 during their first fight in november last year whatever the reason , the public to whom they both refer are the winners			1
what promises to be another colossal fight is coming			0
this time to a football ground near you .			0
