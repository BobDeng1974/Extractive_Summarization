by @entity0 published : 03:47 est , 24 april 2012 updated : 03:24 est , 25 april 2012 speaking out : @entity1 last night dismissed claims that welfare cuts are causing ' social cleansing ' @entity1 last night dismissed claims that welfare cuts are causing ‘ social cleansing ’			2
the @entity7 spoke out after a @entity9 council suggested it would have to move benefit claimants hundreds of miles because of a new cap on payments			1
mr @entity1 said he was ‘ appalled and astonished ’ by the allegations , adding that there were ‘ thousands ’ of cheaper properties where tenants could be housed closer to home			0
@entity21 in @entity22 said it was writing to more than 1,000 housing associations around the country – including one in @entity25 160 miles away – to try to find accommodation for families applying under the new rules			1
as part of its measures to cut the spiralling welfare bill , the government has introduced weekly caps on housing benefit of between £ 250 a week for a one - bedroom flat and £ 400 a week for a four - bedroom property			1
the @entity37 has also decided to cap total welfare payments at £ 26,000 a year			0
ministers say it is completely unacceptable that those on welfare have been provided with taxpayer - funded properties costing as much as £ 100,000 a year to rent			0
they say that like many of those in employment , they should have to live in more affordable areas			0
but @entity49 mayor sir @entity48 insisted spiralling rents in his borough – which is hosting the @entity52 – and the housing benefit cap meant it could no longer afford to put up tenants in the private rented sector			1
@entity21 has written to the @entity56 in @entity25 - 170 miles away - to ask them to ' lease ' homes to it and take on 500 families @entity49 's mayor @entity48 said aside from thousands of people needing to be housed in the @entity52 borough , there was a problem with overcrowding ‘ we are one of the poorest areas in the country , we have massive overcrowding , the people who are here we are trying to deal with , ’ he said			1
‘ what happens ? the government , they pursue policies that push people out from the centre of @entity22 out to here			1
‘ there just is n’t the capacity to deal with them and we end up chasing round the country trying to deal with people who are in need			0
it is not a policy that i am particularly keen on			0
’ @entity87 , chief executive of @entity56 in @entity25 , one of the housing organisations contacted by @entity49 , said : ‘ i think there is a real issue of social cleansing going on			0
’ a proposal sent to @entity95 - controlled @entity94 by one of its private providers , @entity97 , suggests rehousing ‘ 150 people within the next 12 or so months ’ as far away as @entity98			2
@entity100 in @entity101 has said it is seeking to rent private accommodation in @entity103 , while @entity105 , in @entity104 , has moved a small number of families to @entity108			1
mr @entity1 said the claims from @entity21 were ‘ nonsense ’ and that there were ‘ thousands of houses ’ within a few miles which fell within the cap			2
a council estate in @entity115 in @entity49 where mr @entity48 said there is one case where there 's 38 people living in one property and 16 of them are children ministers said there was a £ 190million fund available to help councils manage the reforms and insisted that even after the cap , families can still claim up to £ 21,000 a year towards their rent			2
mr @entity1 said the cap had been in place since april 2011 and ‘ every other council ’ was ‘ managing ’			0
‘ we inherited a housing benefit bill that was out of control , ’ he added			1
‘ we need to get people into housing they can afford to go to work from , so the taxpayer does n’t have to foot that bill			1
i suspect this is a little political at a time of local elections			0
’ a government source said : ‘ these reforms have been up and running for over a year , and any suggestion of “ social cleansing ” is patently ridiculous and factually inaccurate			0

@entity21 , in @entity22 , *blamed* @entity142 cuts to housing benefit for need to move tenants
the council says there are *32,000* people on its housing *waiting* list
says *market* rents are too high and it ca *n't* afford to keep tenants in private accommodation
government accuses council of ' playing politics ' and insists there are homes available
