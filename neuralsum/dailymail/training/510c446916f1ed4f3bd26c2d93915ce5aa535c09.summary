if you feel you have seen it all before , spare a thought for the young man convinced he is trapped in a time loop			1
the feeling of constantly reliving his actions became so severe he stopped watching tv , listening to the radio or reading newspapers			0
the 23 - year - old even had to drop out of university and was tormented by further attacks when he holidayed abroad			1
a 23 - year - old @entity16 man has had to stop watching tv and reading books because he suffers déjà vu so extreme he felt he 'd seen it all before ( file picture posed by a model ) psychologists diagnosed him with severe déjà vu , an extremely rare condition and the first known case to be triggered by anxiety			1
the feelings he experienced were stronger and far more frequent than the normal sense of déjà vu , which is @entity30 for ‘ already seen ’			1
the man said that rather than just a feeling of familiarity , he feared he was reliving the past moment by moment in a real - life enactment of the movie @entity37			1
details of the extraordinary case have been revealed in a report published by the @entity41			0
although sporadic cases of severe déjà vu have been encountered before , all previous cases were triggered by neurological conditions such as epilepsy or dementia			1
however , in this case the trigger was the man ’s anxiety , leading scientists to believe that anxiety disorders could be more related to déjà vu than previously thought , and the peculiar feeling could be triggered in the same way as panic attacks			1
dr @entity58 , a psychology expert from @entity59 , said it could be the first case of a person experiencing persistent déjà vu stemming from anxiety			2
past studies have linked the condition to seizures in the temporal lobe ( the pink part of the brain , pictured ) even though he knew that what he was experiencing was not real , over three years the episodes gradually grew in intensity until they became debilitating			2
his case was analysed by experts from the universities of @entity59 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and universities in @entity81 and @entity30			0
@entity82 found his brain scans appeared normal			0
déjà vu - @entity30 for ' aready seen ' - is a recognised health condition , explored by scientists across the world			1
it is the phenomenon of having the strong sensation that an event or experience currently being experienced has been experienced in the past			0
the psychologist @entity92 in his book @entity94 ( 1928 ) explained the condition as being caused by a person having a brief glimpse of an object or situation , before the brain has completed ' constructing ' a full conscious perception of the experience			0
that ' partial ' perception then results in a false sense of familiarity			2
while scientists have spent years investigating déjà vu , a complete explanation is still lacking			2
the condition is reportedly experienced by more than 70 per cent of people at some point			0
a 2003 study revealed the condition is thought to occur in men and women across races equally			0
but the research found it was most common in people aged 15 to 25			0
other studies have linked the condition with epilepsy			0
there is a strong correlation between déjà vu and the seizures that people with temporal lobe epilepsy suffer			1
a study in 2012 found people with medial temporal lobe epilepsy often experience deja vu as their seizures begin			0
that has led some experts to suggest deja vu could be the result of neural misfiring , where the brain transmits signals randomly , causing healthy people to experience a false sense of familiarity			2
report author dr @entity58 , from @entity142 , said : ‘ rather than simply the unsettling feelings of familiarity which are normally associated with déjà vu , our subject complained that it felt like he was actually retrieving previous experiences from memory , not just finding them familiar			1
‘ most cases like this occur as a side effect associated with epileptic seizures or dementia			0
‘ however , in this instance it appears as though the episodes of déjà vu could be linked to anxiety causing mistimed neuronal firing in the brain , which causes more déjà vu and in turn brings about more anxiety			1
’ the patient ’s anxiety had been so serious he would take two or three showers a day because he felt ‘ contaminated ’ and repeatedly washed his hands			0
he began experiencing severe and frightening cases of déjà vu at 20			2
the early episodes sometimes lasted only for minutes , but other attacks could be extremely prolonged			0
at university he took the hallucinogenic drug lsd once , and from then on the déjà vu would last for several minutes at a time			2
he told professor @entity178 at @entity77 he felt as though he was ‘ trapped in a time loop ’			1
dr @entity58 said : ‘ if proved , this could be the first - ever recorded instance of psychogenic déjà vu , which is déjà vu triggered by anxiety rather than a neurological condition such as dementia or epilepsy			1
‘ distress caused by the déjà vu experience may itself lead to increased levels of déjà vu – similar feedback loops are reported in other anxiety states , for example panic attacks			1
’ without knowing for sure exactly how the severe symptoms have been caused , dr @entity58 said there was no way to treat the young man .			0

the 23 - year - old @entity16 man told experts he felt ' trapped in a time loop '
rather than just a sense of familiarity he felt he was reliving the past
*bizarrely* the man did *n't* suffer any neurological conditions previously reported in people who suffer frequent déjà vu
his *problem* was anxiety leading scientists to believe the condition may be linked to and triggered by anxiety disorders like panic attacks
