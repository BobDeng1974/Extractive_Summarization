by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity3 reporter @entity4 , the wife of @entity6 's son @entity5 , is among @entity8 's preferred candidates for president of the @entity10 @entity6 ’s daughter - in - law is among @entity8 ’s preferred candidates for president of the @entity10 – in what could become the latest coup for the family in snaring lucrative top jobs in @entity17			1
@entity4 , the prime minister of @entity18 , is being touted for the role , with @entity20 said to view her as a much more acceptable alternative to @entity22 , the arch - federalist former prime minister of @entity23			1
he would also be happy with @entity26 president @entity25 , a free marketeer who models herself on @entity30			0
miss @entity4 , 47 , is married to former @entity32 leader @entity6 ’s son @entity5			1
she infamously featured in a selfie with mr @entity20 and @entity34 last year at @entity36 ’s funeral service			2
even though @entity37 is a social democrat , mr @entity20 is believed to favour her because her country is on the eurosceptic wing of the continent			2
should she get the job – worth £ 236,000 a year – she would be the latest @entity6 to work in @entity43			2
lord and @entity45 have both held roles in @entity43 , the former as an @entity48 and the latter as an @entity50 , and their son worked as a research assistant in the @entity53			2
last night a @entity55 source said @entity37 was one of several ‘ high - quality ’ candidates who are ‘ younger , bolder ’ and more willing to ‘ take the @entity10 on a different course ’			0
disagreements over who should take on the crucial role continued yesterday when @entity61 publicly slapped down mr @entity20 for issuing ‘ threats ’ to leave @entity43 if he does not get his way over choosing the @entity10 president			1
mr @entity20 was at a summit in @entity1 yesterday trying to drum up support to block front - runner mr @entity22			2
the prime minister fears mr @entity22 is not open to reform of the @entity69 , and has suggested appointing him could send @entity70 drifting towards the exit door in the in - out referendum he has promised for 2017			1
@entity73 chancellor @entity61 this morning warned @entity20 not to make threats in his bid to overhaul @entity70 's relationship with @entity17 mrs @entity61 insisted she was still backing @entity22 to be president of the @entity10 , but urged other leaders to act in a ' @entity43 spirit ' when the prime minister was asked if he had threatened to leave the @entity69 , at a press conference in @entity82 , the @entity84 prime minister 's country residence , mrs @entity61 cut in			1
she said : ' i made myself clear by saying that i am for @entity22			0
but when i made that statement in @entity73 i also made the point that we act in a @entity43 spirit			0
‘ we always do that because otherwise you would never reach a compromise ... threats are not part and parcel of that spirit			0
that is not part of the way in which we usually proceed			0
' it was a snub for mr @entity20 who is understood to have hit out at mr @entity22 's suitability for the role at the leaders dinner on monday night			1
the four leaders agreed that whoever the next commissioner is , a commitment to tackle benefit tourism must be top of their agenda			0
the commissioner 's programme is written in the next few months and they plan to convince the other 24 national leaders that protecting country 's social security systems from the freedom of movement rules must be on it			0
tensions were laid bare during the joint press conference between @entity120 prime minister @entity119 , @entity73 chancellor @entity61 , @entity84 prime minister , @entity122 and @entity70 prime minister @entity20 , at the summer residence , @entity82 , south of @entity124 , @entity1 the four @entity43 leaders posed first on a boat and later at lecterns in the sunshine , keen to present a united front			1
but behind the scenes there remain deep divisions about who will run the @entity10			0
last night they dined on smoked salmon tartare , followed by roast filet of beef with bacon and morel ragu and for dessert , elderflower semifredo strawberry compote with meringue and strawberries			0
the public spat over @entity22 will leave an unpleasant taste in the mouth			0
mr @entity20 attending the mini summit in the @entity84 countryside , with mrs @entity61 , the @entity84 prime minister @entity122 and @entity120 prime minister @entity119 , all @entity69 reformers			1
the foursome enjoyed a scenic boat trip on a balmy monday evening in matching life jackets , then enjoyed an intimate meal at the residence , where mr @entity20 told them allowing mr @entity22 to have the role would be a ' stitch up ' by the @entity53 and would set a ‘ dangerous precedent ’ for the future			1
the leaders nailed down their priorities for reform and who would best fulfil them			0
a clampdown on benefit tourism is a top priority , along with jobs and growth , cutting red tape for businesses and completing the single market in energy			0
@entity8 sources say there are ‘ high quality ’ alternative candidates mr @entity20 would support			0
they are thought to include the @entity18 prime minister @entity4 , who featured in a selfie with mr @entity20 and @entity34 last year in @entity178			1
@entity179 , the head of the @entity180 has ruled herself out , but would be a popular choice for many , and @entity26 president @entity25 , a free marketer who models herself on @entity30			0
@entity1 ’s mr @entity122 boosted mr @entity20 ’s hopes yesterday this week by saying he agreed that national leaders , not @entity50 should pick the @entity10 president			1
mr @entity20 said after the summit that he wanted @entity70 to stay in a reformed @entity69 , and would leave the decision to a referendum			1
but he added : ‘ obviously the approach that the @entity69 takes between now and then will be very important			0
if we can achieve reforms , if we can demonstrate openness , competitiveness , flexibility , less interference , reform - if people are capable of taking the @entity69 forward in that direction that will be helpful			2
obviously if the @entity69 does n't go in that direction that would be very unhelpful			0
’ labour leader @entity202 and @entity203 have both backed mr @entity20 ’s bid to block mr @entity22 , and he is thought to have support from other leaders including @entity208 prime minister @entity207			1
mr @entity22 emerged as the front runner because he was picked earlier this year by @entity50 from the @entity211 group - which won the most seats in the @entity53 , but still only took less than a third			0
@entity61 is pushing for arch - federalist @entity22 ( left ) to become the new @entity10 president , but @entity180 chief @entity179 ( second left ) has emerged as a compromise candidate favoured by @entity20			1
other politicians in line for @entity43 's most powerful position include @entity18 pm @entity4 and @entity220 taoiseach @entity219 @entity22 is the favourite to become the new @entity10 president - replacing the outgoing former @entity224 prime minister @entity223			1
the former @entity23 prime minister was chosen as the candidate for the top job by the @entity53 's main conservative group , the @entity211			1
the @entity211 emerged from last week 's elections with the most seats - leaving mr @entity22 in poll position for the @entity69 's most powerful job			1
but the @entity10 president is chosen by @entity43 leaders including @entity20 - and not by the @entity53			1
@entity50 do however have to confirm the leaders ' choice for the job in a vote			0
the other candidates for the top @entity69 job include the @entity180 chief @entity179			2
miss @entity179 was finance minister under former president @entity241 before moving to the @entity180 at the height of the euro zone 's debt crisis in 2011 to replace disgraced @entity246 politician @entity245			0
her term runs until 2016			0
a fluent @entity249 - speaker who headed a major @entity251 law firm before holding ministerial office in @entity246 , she is highly regarded by @entity73 leader @entity61			0
center - left @entity18 prime minister @entity4 is also under consideration			1
the former @entity50 is the daughter - in - law of @entity6 , the ex @entity32 leader and @entity43 commissioner			2
if mrs @entity61 was open to a @entity246 candidate for one of the top jobs , @entity256 might offer @entity260 former prime minister @entity261 - a fluent @entity73 - speaker who was replaced in march but is well regarded in @entity262			1
another candidate for the @entity10 president is the current @entity220 taoiseach @entity219			2
the @entity266 leader became @entity220 's leader in 2011 , so might be open to moving to @entity17 .			2

prime minister of *denmark* being touted for the @entity10 role
@entity20 said to view her as more acceptable than @entity273
ms @entity4 , 47 , is married to @entity6 's son @entity5
@entity22 is the leading candidate to become next @entity10 chief
but @entity20 says @entity43 leaders must choose top jobs in @entity17
row threatens to *undermine* @entity284 's bid to reform @entity70 's relationship with @entity69
