at nearly £ 14,000 to send a kilogram of food into space , cosmic cuisine does n’t come cheap			1
but by december this year , @entity4 plans to have grown its own food in space for the first time			1
as well as cutting costs , @entity4 is hoping its space farm will be scaled up to deliver a lasting supply of food for astronauts on deep space missions			1
by december , @entity4 plans to have grown its own food in space for the first time			1
in preparation for the project , the space agency grew plants under red and blue lights to better understand growth patterns it could also provide something called ‘ horticultural therapy ’ for astronauts to reduce stress , alleviate depression and improve their overall general health			2
the work is part of the @entity30 ( @entity31 ) to grow six romaine lettuce plants under pink led lamps , according to a report by @entity35			1
@entity36 reports that @entity38 pillow - packs , filled with a material similar to kitty litter , will function as planters for the lettuce which will be ready to harvest after just 28 days			0
@entity4 claims that after extensive testing on plants on @entity45 , it does n’t expect zero - gravity conditions to affect the growth of the plants			1

dr @entity53 , a plant biologist from @entity54 and @entity55 , is pictured measuring @entity57 radish plants for @entity4 earlier this year , a team of ‘ gastronauts ’ spent four months living in a small dome on a barren @entity62 lava field , trying to find out what foods astronauts might eat on a mission to @entity66			2
the group of six had been working as part of a $ 1 million @entity71 ( @entity70 ) project			0
team commander @entity72 said the problem with ingredients that are not perishable is they 're usually highly processed and lack @entity76 added that he was impressed with how freeze dried products taste very similar to fresh produce			0
a favourite among the crew was nutella , the chocolate - hazelnut spread			0
‘ it 's something we craved , ’ he said			0
‘ we had a limited supply so we had to ration it			0
’ the bigger problems is cosmic microbes that could develop in the lettuce			0
@entity4 said all plants grown in on the @entity91 ( @entity91 ) in december will undergo strict testing on @entity45 before they are consumed			1
while @entity4 has tested plant growth in space before for academic purposes , this is the first project to grow food with the aim of sustaining future astronauts			1
last month , @entity4 also revealed that it had given 3d printer firm @entity101 ( @entity101 ) a six month , $ 125,000 grant to focus on developing a universal food synthesiser			2
the device is similar to the ‘ replicator ’ used in several of the @entity107 tv series which enabled crew members to create their favourite foods			0
@entity4 said it is investing in the project because it wants to make it easier to transport nutrients in bulk through space			2
astronaut @entity115 , flight engineer ( left ) and cosmonaut @entity117 , commander ( right ) , are showing eating a meal send from @entity45			0
the current cost of sending food into space is around £ 14,000 per kg @entity101 ’s founder @entity122 added that the device will also help solve the @entity45 ’s looming food crisis			1
meanwhile , @entity125 has said it is preparing plans to grow fresh vegetables on @entity66 and the moon after researchers successfully completed a preliminary test in @entity131			0
four kinds of vegetables were grown in an ' ecological life support system ' , a 300 cubic metre cabin which will allow astronauts to develop their own stocks of air , water and food while on space missions			2
the system , which relies on plants and algae , is ' expected to be used in extra-terrestrial bases on the moon or @entity66 ' , according to a report by @entity147 .			0

@entity4 plans to grow six romaine lettuce plants under pink led lamps on the @entity91 within the next three months
if successful , a scaled - up version of its space farm could deliver a lasting supply of food to astronauts on deep space missions
this could cut cost of sending food from @entity45 - currently at £ 14,000 per kg
