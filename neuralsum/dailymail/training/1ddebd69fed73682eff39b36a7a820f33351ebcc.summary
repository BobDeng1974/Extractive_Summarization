together in 2001 : if prince @entity2 could attempt to hand him deposition papers prince @entity2 is now unable to visit the @entity4 without running the risk of being ambushed with a subpoena , a lawyer warned yesterday			1
if he sets foot there , attorneys acting for @entity1 could attempt to hand him deposition papers , he said			1
these would oblige him to give evidence on oath – or face the threat of jail			1
the legal team representing miss @entity1 has already tried to ambush several people they wish to question with legal papers , including @entity2 ’s friend @entity19			1
if they succeeded in passing deposition papers to @entity2 , in theory he would be obliged to attend court			1
the unwelcome prospect is enough to make royal courtiers think carefully before planning any visits to the @entity4 , where @entity2 has been many times both in an official capacity and on holiday			1
it is also unknown if he is covered by legal immunity – either as a royal or because he was a @entity33 - backed business envoy – because this has never been tested in international law			0
yesterday leading @entity37 lawyer @entity36 said miss @entity1 ’s attorneys could try to serve papers on @entity2 at an airport when he arrived – which could create an embarrassing scene , not least because of his royal protection officers – or could wait until he was at a place , such as a restaurant , where it would be awkward for him to ‘ run away ’			1
risk : the unwelcome prospect is enough to make royal courtiers think carefully before planning any visits to the @entity4 , where @entity2 ( yesterday in @entity49 ) has been many times both in an official capacity and on holiday lawyers , or their representatives , have even pretended to be butlers at charity galas to hand papers to a target , he added			1
if the prince was handed deposition papers and then refused to attend , he could be held in contempt of court			1
‘ if he does n’t show up , lawyers can ask a judge to start a contempt hearing so that if he came back into the country , he could be arrested and put in jail , ’ mr @entity36 said			0
‘ it could be problematic for him if he wants to return to @entity4			2
’ previous trip to the @entity4 : prince @entity2 speaks during a visit to @entity72 , @entity73 , in october 2003 @entity2 plays golf on @entity75 in @entity76 on another previous visit to the @entity4 in august 1999 @entity2 ’s lawyers would probably try to quash a subpoena , but there was no guarantee of success			2
he said : ‘ if the judge really believes that he has vital evidence , then he might not throw it out			0
' in that case , @entity2 ’s lawyers will probably come to an arrangement under which he will give a deposition but at a time of their choosing			2
they will also probably ask that it not be made public or leaked			0
’ another option to get @entity2 to give evidence would be via a @entity96 judge			1
however , such things are hard to enforce , he said			0
@entity99 law professor : @entity100 ( pictured ) a @entity99 law professor accused along with prince @entity2 of abusing @entity1 said yesterday that she had ‘ made the whole thing up ’ and accused her lawyers of putting ‘ real ’ rape victims ‘ in a terrible position ’ with her claims			2
on @entity4 television , @entity100 denied ever seeing anything improper or even being around under - age women in the presence of @entity111			2
miss @entity1 alleges mr @entity100 came into a room to ‘ chat ’ with @entity111 while she performed a sex act on him			0
but the professor said : ‘ i ’ve never seen her and i ’ve never met her			0
’ later on @entity115 , he said that , by @entity117 ’ own account , she was not underage when she met @entity2			0
he added : ‘ she claims she got paid for it			0
she ’s admitting that she ’s been a prostitute			0

deposition papers would oblige him to give evidence - or face jail threat
