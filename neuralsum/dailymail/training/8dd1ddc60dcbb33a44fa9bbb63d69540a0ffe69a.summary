a number of former soldiers have spoken out against the move because of the tough logistical life of fighters on the front line , even though many outsiders see defense secretary @entity8 's decision to lift the ban on women serving in combat positions as a progressive move			1
some have spoken out about how the move ignores some of the realities of war , like disgusting unhygienic conditions and the way that soldiers are sometimes forced to change in front of one another , in favor of gender equality			1
one wrote a letter in the @entity25 describing the conditions he faced on the front line when he was involved in the initial invasion of @entity29 in 2003			0
up to 25 @entity30 at a time were packed into an amphibious assault vehicles intended to hold only 15 , with the @entity30 sitting ontop of one another for long periods of time			0
when an uncontrollable urge hit a @entity30 , he would be forced to stand , as best he could , hold an @entity60 bag up to his rear , and defecate inches from his seated comrade 's face , ’ @entity52 wrote in the opinion piece			1
he went on to say that they were unable to change out of their chemical protective suits for nearly a month , and once they secured @entity70 , they finally changed out of the suits which were caked in blood and human filth at that point			0
‘ my unit stood there in a walled - in compound in @entity70 , naked , sores dotted all over our bodies , feet peeling , watching our suits burn			1
later , they lined us up naked and washed us off with pressure washers , ’ he wrote			1
welcoming : mr @entity8 said that women play an integral role in the combat mission the historic change , which was recommended by the @entity87 , overturns a 1994 rule prohibiting women from being assigned to smaller ground combat units			1
it will be up to the military service chiefs to recommend and defend whether women should be excluded from any of those more demanding and deadly positions , such as @entity95 or the @entity97 's @entity96			1
the services will have until january 2016 to make a case to that some positions should remain closed to women			1
the change wo n't take place overnight : service chiefs will have to develop plans for allowing women to seek the combat positions , a senior military official said			1
‘ my unit stood there in a walled - in compound in @entity70 , naked , sores dotted all over our bodies , feet peeling , watching our suits burn			1
later , they lined us up naked and washed us off with pressure washers ' - @entity52 , former soldier some jobs may open as soon as this year , while assessments for others , such as special operations forces , may take longer			1
some insiders remain hesitant about the move , saying that while it may seem progressive to incorporate all , it may not be the most efficient way to run an army			1
' every female troop i know ( over the age of 25 ) says publicly , " sure , open them up ! " and privately , " but not for me personally			0
i know i do n't have the brute strength required and i would be crushed to let down my colleagues -- so , no way , no thanks , " ' an anonymous female army officer told @entity137			0
women 's rights advocates say that concerns about female soldiers urinating or dealing with menstrual cycles while on the front lines are problems that have already been addressed			1
@entity144 , the co-president of the @entity145 , told @entity146 that female soldiers already undergo a specific training course dedicated to discussing gender - specific hygiene issues			0
as a result , many use a tool called a @entity153 ( which effectively has a small tube that runs down one 's pant leg ) would allow women to urinate into a container if they were kept in a tank for a long period of time			1
equality : others see the lifting of the ban as a way to catch up with the progressive times they also cover a number of ways to address their menstrual cycles by either taking daily menstruation suppressant pills			1
' this is n't something new ; part of this is a response to what has been going on for a long time , ' ms @entity144 said			0
' i 'm not particularly concerned about the hygienic concerns			0
there might be privacy concerns that you 'd like to have but you cant have in a battle environment			0
' there long has been opposition to putting women in combat , based on questions of whether they have the necessary strength and stamina for certain jobs , or whether their presence might hurt unit cohesion			1
but as news of @entity8 's expected order got out , many members of @entity197 , including the @entity199 chairman , @entity200 senator @entity198 announced their support			1
‘ it reflects the reality of 21st century military operations , ’ @entity198 said			0
@entity208 , executive vice president of the @entity209 , called the move ‘ another social experiment ’ that will place unnecessary burdens on military commanders			2
‘ while their focus must remain on winning the battles and protecting their troops , they will now have the distraction of having to provide some separation of the genders during fast moving and deadly situations , ’ said @entity208 , a retired @entity97 lieutenant general			0
he noted that small units often are in sustained combat for extended periods of time under primal living conditions with no privacy			0
@entity8 's move comes in his final weeks as @entity230 chief and just days after president @entity233 's inaugural speech in which he spoke passionately about equal rights for all			1
the new order expands the department 's action of nearly a year ago to open about 14,500 combat positions to women , nearly all of them in the @entity97			2
support : @entity243 ambassador @entity242 expressed her support for the measure changing qualifications : senior defense officials say @entity230 chief @entity8 is removing the military 's ban on women serving in combat in an afternoon press conference confirming the news alongside @entity87 chairman general @entity254 , mr @entity8 said that not everyone can meet the qualifications to be a combat soldier			1
but , he said , everyone is entitled to the chance			0
he said the qualifications will not be reduced , and with women playing a broader role , the military will be strengthened			2
former prisoner of war @entity264 calls it good news for the @entity269 military that defense secretary @entity8 says women can serve in combat roles			1
the @entity273 resident says women have long been integral to victories in the fight for freedom			2
@entity264 was 19 when she was captured after her @entity97 unit took a wrong turn and came under attack in @entity29 in 2003			1
she was rescued after nine days in captivity			0
@entity264 urges @entity269 to support military men and women , and to push @entity269 officials to ensure they have proper training and equipment			1
in addition to questions of strength and performance , there also have been suggestions that the @entity269 public would not tolerate large numbers of women being killed in war			2
under the 1994 @entity230 policy , women were prohibited from being assigned to ground combat units below the brigade level			2
a brigade is roughly 3,500 troops split into several battalions of about 800 soldiers each			0
on the front lines : the move lifts a ban that was put in place in 1994 historically , brigades were based farther from the front lines , and they often included top command and support staff			2
the necessities of combat in @entity29 and @entity315 , however , propelled women into jobs as medics , military police and intelligence officers that were sometimes attached — but not formally assigned — to battalions			2
problem solver : the inclusion of women is believed it may help decrease the ever - growing number of problems within the military , like sexual harassment and sexual assaults so while a woman could n't be assigned as an infantryman in a battalion going out on patrol , she could fly the helicopter supporting the unit , or move in to provide medical aid if troops were injured			1
and these conflicts , where battlefield lines are blurred and insurgents can lurk around every corner , have made it almost impossible to keep women clear of combat			2
still , as recent surveys and experiences have shown , it will not be an easy transition			0
when the @entity30 sought women to go through its tough infantry course last year , two volunteered and both failed to complete the course			2
and there may not be a wide clamoring from women for the more intense , dangerous and difficult jobs , including some infantry and commando positions			2
' i know , you still hear : " it ’s a man ’s military			0
" but we are all service members , ' @entity366 , an @entity367 veteran who served in @entity368 and @entity369 , told @entity371			0
' look at the @entity30 — they have equal standards of fitness for both genders			0
if the men ca n’t respect women for the job they ’re doing maybe these men should n’t be in the military			2
' two lawsuits were filed last year challenging the @entity230 's ban on women serving in combat , adding pressure on officials to overturn the policy			0
military services have been studying the issue and surveying their forces to determine how it may affect performance and morale			0
the @entity87 have been meeting regularly on the matter and they unanimously agreed to send the recommendation to @entity8 earlier this month			1
a senior military official familiar with the discussions said the chiefs laid out three main principles to guide them as they move through the process			0
those were to maintain @entity269 's effective fighting force , preserve military readiness and develop a process that would give all service members the best chance to succeed			0
women comprise about 14 per cent of the 1.4 million active military personnel			0
more than 280,000 women have been sent to @entity29 , @entity315 or to jobs in neighboring nations in support of the wars			0
of the more than 6,600 @entity269 service members who have been killed , 152 have been women			0
the senior military official said the military chiefs must report back to @entity8 with their initial implementation plans by may 15 .			1

*ex-soldiers* tell of how they often have to relieve themselves inches away from one another inside *cramped* tanks
other times they are all forced to strip naked and wash with *pow*er hoses
say that it will be *awkward* having women thrown in the *harrowing* mix
defense secretary @entity8 announced plan in press conference
former *pow* @entity264 says move is a good one , will *improve* forces
