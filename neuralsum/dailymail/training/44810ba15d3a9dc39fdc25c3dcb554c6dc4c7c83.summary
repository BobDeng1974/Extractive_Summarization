@entity1 spies have intercepted computer deliveries , exploited hardware vulnerabilities , and even hijacked @entity5 's internal reporting system all in the name of stealing data from some of their toughest targets			1
these latest revelations to emerge about the undercover work of the @entity1 focus on the work carried out by an elite team of hackers known as @entity16 ( @entity16 )			1
citing internal @entity1 documents , @entity18 magazine @entity17 said on sunday that @entity16 's mission is ‘ getting the ungettable , ’ and quoted an unnamed intelligence official as saying that @entity16 had gathered ‘ some of the most significant intelligence our country has ever seen			1
’ the investigation followed earlier reports of the @entity1 ( headquarters pictured ) spying on @entity29 products , which suggested a ' backdoor ' in @entity31 could provide hackers with valuable information			0
@entity29 said at the time that it had never worked with the @entity1 to deliberately weaken its products @entity17 said @entity16 has a catalog of high - tech gadgets for particularly hard - to - crack cases , including computer monitor cables specially modified to record what is being typed across the screen , usb sticks secretly fitted with radio transmitters to broadcast stolen data over the airwaves , and fake base stations intended to intercept mobile phone signals on the go			2
the @entity1 does n't just rely on @entity49 - style spy gear , the magazine said			0
some of the attacks described by @entity17 exploit weaknesses in the architecture of the internet to deliver malicious software to specific computers			0
others take advantage of weaknesses in hardware or software distributed by some of the world 's leading information technology companies , including @entity64 and @entity66 's @entity65 , the magazine reported			0
@entity17 cited a 2008 mail order catalog - style list of vulnerabilities that @entity1 spies could exploit from companies such as @entity71 or @entity72			2

’ old - fashioned methods get a mention too			0
@entity17 said that if the @entity1 tracked a target ordering a new computer or other electronic accessories , @entity16 could tap its allies in the @entity96 and the @entity97 , intercept the hardware in transit , and take it to a secret workshop where it could be discretely fitted with espionage software before being sent on its way			1
intercepting computer equipment in such a way is among the @entity1 's ‘ most productive operations , ’ and has helped harvest intelligence from around the world , one document cited by @entity17 stated			2
one of the most striking reported revelations concerned the @entity1 's alleged ability to spy on @entity5 's crash reports , familiar to many users of the @entity114 operating system as the dialogue box which pops up when a game freezes or a @entity118 document dies			1
protestors hold up placards featuring a picture of former @entity1 contractor @entity76 during a march against the spying methods of the @entity82 in @entity83 , northern @entity18 on sunday the reporting system is intended to help @entity5 engineers improve their products and fix bugs , but @entity17 said the @entity1 was also sifting through the reports to help spies break into machines running @entity114			1
one @entity1 document cited by the magazine appeared to poke fun at @entity5 's expense , replacing the software giant 's standard error report message with the words : ‘ this information may be intercepted by a foreign sigint ( signals intelligence ) system to gather detailed information and better exploit your machine			1
’ @entity5 did not immediately return a call seeking comment , but the company is one of several @entity82 firms that have demanded more transparency from the @entity1 - and worked to bolster their security - in the wake of the revelations of former intelligence worker @entity76 , whose disclosures have ignited an international debate over privacy and surveillance			0
@entity17 did not explicitly say where its cache @entity1 documents had come from , although the magazine has previously published a series of stories based on documents leaked by @entity76 , and one of @entity76 's key contacts - @entity82 documentary filmmaker @entity165 - was listed among the article 's six authors			2
