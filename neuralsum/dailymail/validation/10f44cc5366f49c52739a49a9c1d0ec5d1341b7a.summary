@entity1 legend @entity0 gave fans at @entity3 a glimpse of his very , very best after nailing a cheeky pass to @entity6 during an @entity8 game between a @entity9 and a @entity10 the former @entity1 man hung up his boots in december , but there was no sign of rustiness as the 37 - year - old former @entity16 international pulled off the audacious move			1
@entity0 , who had been playing for @entity20 side @entity19 before calling it a day , looked set to pull the trigger after picking up the ball on the edge of the box , only to dummy a shot with his right and play a pass with his left			2
@entity1 legend @entity0 looks set to go for goal as he picks up the ball on his right foot just outside the box during the game but the former @entity16 international fools everybody has he dummies the shot and passes with his left foot to find @entity6 in space a confused defender backs away as @entity0 's trickery gets the better of him in front of the @entity3 support as he plays @entity6 through the ball falls to babel who sadly drags his effort wide of goal as fans at the @entity8 game applaud @entity0 's trickery at @entity3 on sunday @entity0 ( second left ) shares a joke with @entity51 midfielder @entity50 at @entity3 , as the two teams make their way from the pitch @entity6 was the man to benefit from the pass as it rolled perfectly to his feet , but the @entity58 dragged his effort wide in a manner @entity51 fans had become fully accustomed to during his time on @entity62			1
the first goal of the game had been scored by @entity65 and a cracker it was too , the @entity68 whipping a 25 - yard drive that fizzed into the corner of @entity72 net on nine minutes			1
he was n’t put under great pressure but the finish still smacked of class			0
at one stage it looked as if @entity79 ’s side , managed by @entity80 , would saunter to victory but @entity82 has made comebacks a fixture of his @entity51 career and he ensured this match did not end in defeat			2
@entity0 ( right ) , who played for @entity82 's team in the charity match , shakes hands with his @entity92 colleague @entity79 @entity65 opened the scoring at @entity3 after slamming in a long - range shot into the corner of the goal as @entity82 looked on @entity97 added a second goal to put @entity79 's side 2 - 0 up at @entity3 after rounding the keeper and slotting into an empty net @entity102 does his best to stop @entity82 from scoring from the spot after a penalty was awarded to the @entity51 captain 's side a second penalty of the afternoon followed for @entity82 and he duly converted that one too to level the scores at @entity3 he scored two penalties , one in the 36th minute after @entity110 had adjudged to trip @entity111 and another just after the hour when @entity79 quite clearly barged @entity112 over			1
some would say the @entity114 columnist was lucky not to make it into @entity117 ’s book			0
the icing on the cake would have been a goal for either @entity122 or @entity112 but , despite the best efforts of the @entity124 in particular , it never arrived			2
a draw was an appropriate end to a memorable day			2
the smiles on the faces as a lap of honour was completed confirmed that			0
