by @entity0 when @entity2 was asked to present @entity3 , no one could have known how appropriate a choice it was			1
for gardening has not only been her hobby and passion , it ’s what saved her in her darkest hours			1
@entity2 tells today how she has struggled with depression for decades – and while she has also relied on medication in the past , it is the simple pleasure of being in the garden that has proved the best cure			1
she reveals for the first time how gardening lifted her out of the pit of despair and rescued her from a painful divorce			1
‘ however busy i am , i always find time to garden , ’ @entity2 says			1
‘ it does my head good			1
@entity25 said that featuring on the @entity3 pulled her out of her darkest hours during those times when i was unwell and depressed and feeling under pressure , i ’d go out into the garden and hours would slide by			1
it ’s the most wonderful therapy			2
‘ there have been periods in my life when my garden has been particularly important to me			2
i ’ve always thought nurturing something is good for the soul			2
it ’s also good for your physical and emotional welfare when you ca n’t see your way out of such despair			1
’ the 56 - year - old is now happily married to tv chef @entity44			2
they have a 12 - year - old daughter , @entity45 , and @entity44 is a loving stepfather to @entity2 ’s children from her first marriage – twins @entity48 and @entity50 , 20 , and @entity51 , 17 today			1
@entity2 has enjoyed a prosperous career , presenting @entity54 ’s @entity53 for ten years before going on to have her own chat show			1
and in addition to her latest @entity58 series – in which teams tend plots at @entity61 in @entity62 as they seek to impress the judges with their fruit , veg and flowers – she recently published her fourth novel			1
yet for all the outward success , @entity2 spent years on antidepressants , only giving them up 18 months ago			1
‘ i always thought i would be on them until i died , because why would i want to stop taking something that was keeping me stable ? ’ she says			2
‘ then something changed and i said , “ you ’re going to be all right			2
all the s * * * in your life has happened			2
nothing can be worse than it has been – you can do it			2
” ‘ i do n’t have manic depression , which is a shame really , because it would be nice to feel some highs			1
but i ’m just somewhere underneath the medium line all the time			2
’ @entity2 had her first experience of depression as a child and has suffered attacks throughout her adult life			1
things were so difficult at one point that she planned to crash her car into a brick wall			2
when she was 21 she was raped but decided not to tell police			2
she wrote about the attack in her 2008 autobiography , @entity93 , sparking fierce debate about the rights and wrongs of leaving such crimes unreported			2
the television star came under further attack that year when it was revealed that her 5st weight loss was nothing to do with sensible eating ( she was advertising @entity104 at the time ) but was thanks to secret gastric surgery			2
but even when she was young continuity announcer on @entity109 in @entity110 , the garden was her sanctuary			2
@entity2 says : ‘ i lived in the @entity112 in @entity113 , just over the bridge from @entity115 , in a cottage i rented from a farmer			1
he let me use a small space in his greenhouse where i tried my hand at growing tomatoes			0
what i did n’t know was that you had to pinch out the leaves to let the trusses set			0
but the farmer set me straight and i did get some good results in the end			0
’ then , in the first house she bought nearby , she planted gladioli and a willow tree			0
‘ i ’d spend weekends in the garden , planting and digging and sowing a lawn with seed			0
‘ i readily acknowledge that this was n’t perhaps the pastime of your average 25 - year - old but my mother and father [ the actor @entity144 ] were enthusiastic gardeners so it was something i grew up with			0
’ x gardening would again prove a solace when her first marriage , to tv executive @entity150 , fell apart at the end of the @entity152			1
@entity2 found herself a single mother to three children aged under five			1
‘ i ’d be on my own at weekends when the kids were with their dad , ’ she says			0
‘ i took to the garden as a form of therapy , planting hundreds of daffodils and visiting local garden centres for unusual flowers and plants – seeing my geraniums come into bud gave me real joy			0
’ although she can smile about it now , @entity2 was at her lowest ebb back then			1
even now , 15 years later , her eyes glisten with tears as she says : ‘ when you ’re very emotional , you get brain tired but not physically tired			0
that ’s when you ca n’t sleep , however much you want to shut out all the pain			0
‘ so digging for all i was worth in the garden was a way of getting physically exhausted			0
my hands would be sore , and my knees and shoulders would ache			0
i ’d get into a hot bath and perhaps have a glass of wine before going to bed and enjoying a deep , replenishing sleep			0
’ perhaps , most of all , in the garden @entity2 does n’t have to pretend			1
she explains : ‘ it does n’t involve wearing make - up or looking smart			1
i do n’t have to be smiling or be “ life - is - golden @entity2			1
” i do n’t have to look as if i have n’t a care in the world			0
if there have been occasions when i wanted to cry – and quite often there were – then i cried			0
’ life is brighter now			0
she married @entity44 in 2000 and the couple live in a beautiful house set in two acres in @entity200 with the children and @entity44 ’s labrador @entity203 @entity2 says : ‘ i was in my mid- 40s by the time i had @entity45 so we were incredibly lucky to be blessed with a child			1
@entity44 and i always say we got in just as the late - night shops were shutting their doors			0
’ @entity44 is also a keen gardener and has planted an orchard in the grounds of their home			0
‘ yes , he ’s out there , stripped to the waist , shifting rocks and splitting logs , ’ @entity2 laughs			1
‘ a real lumberjack , a proper hunter / gatherer			0
@entity44 also has an obsession with grass			0
i ’m responsible for the decorative border , as it were , as well as the vegetables			0
i try to get out in the garden every day			0
it might just be for 20 minutes to open up the greenhouse and water everything but it ’s for longer at weekends			0
’ apart from writing fiction – her latest novel , a @entity230 , has just been published – her chosen private pursuit is being mirrored by her professional life			1
on its first outing a couple of weeks ago , the @entity3 attracted over 2.5 million viewers , the second most watched show that evening after hospital drama @entity237			1
last week , ratings fell slightly as football fans ( @entity44 included ) opted to watch @entity243 ’s @entity242 semi-final , but the presenter says @entity58 is ‘ very happy ’ with the show ’s performance			1
as a @entity247 convert , @entity2 is also happy to report that the show was ‘ trending ’ on @entity247 last week – although she admits she has no idea that actually means			1
‘ almost all the tweets were positive although one person did say my bottom was as big as a pumpkin but that ’s fair enough , ’ she laughs			0
so will there be a new series of the @entity3 in 2015 ? ‘ i honestly do n’t know , ’ @entity2 says while simultaneously tapping the side of her nose with some vigour			1
certainly , she would n’t need to be asked twice to host a second series			0
‘ i absolutely loved it , but then there ’s something so bonding about working with a group of people dedicated to their precious plots of land			0
‘ if i ’m lucky enough to know that my last hour is approaching , i ’d ask someone to wheel me out into the garden because that ’s where i ’d like to die			0
to lie on the grass and look at the leaves against the blue sky is a kind of prayer in itself			0
