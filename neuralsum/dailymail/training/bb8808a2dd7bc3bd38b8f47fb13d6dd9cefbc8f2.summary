scientists in @entity1 have found 19 living descendants of a prehistoric iceman whose 5,300 - year - old body was found frozen in the @entity5			1
researchers from the @entity7 at @entity8 took dna samples from blood donors in @entity11 in the west of the country			1
they managed to match a particular genetic mutation with that of @entity16 , whose body was discovered back in 1991			1
descendants : scientists have found 19 living relatives of @entity16 who was found frozen in the @entity5 only a very small number of select individuals from history have had their genetic codes sequenced before , and none with @entity27 's noble pedigree			1
they include @entity16 the iceman , pictured , whose mummified 3,000 - year - old remains were found in the @entity5 in 1991 experts now believe that the same mutation might also be found in the nearby rgions of @entity34 in @entity35 and the @entity11 region of @entity37			1
according to the @entity40 , @entity38 from the university , said : ' we have already found @entity35 and @entity5 partners so that we can pursue our research			1
' dna from around 3,700 blood donors were analysed and the men were also asked to provide information on their ancestry			1
none of the donors have been informed that they are distantly related to @entity16			2
since the body was found frozen under the @entity5 two decades ago , scientists have conducted experiments to learn how he came to be buried between the @entity1 and @entity5 borders more than 5,300 years ago			1
preserved : @entity16 is kept in a specially built museum in @entity58 , @entity37			0
visitors view the mummy through portholes into a specially refrigerated room a hole in his collarbone suggested he was killed by an arrow , then a brain scan concluded he died from a fall			2
but research earlier this year , from the @entity70 of @entity58 / @entity58 ( @entity71 ) in @entity72 , discovered he suffered brain damage likely caused by a blow to the head			0
in 2001 , scientists from @entity1 's @entity78 scanned @entity16 using a cat scan			1
they found dark spots at the back of the iceman mummy 's cerebrum and concluded he may have died from a head injury			1
it was suggested that falling , after being hit by the arrow , or while climbing , may have caused this head injury			0
history : the mummy was found in september 1991 in the @entity91 , hence the name @entity16 , near the @entity94 mountain and @entity95 on the border between @entity1 and @entity37 the mummy was found in september 1991 in the @entity91 , hence the name @entity16 , near the @entity94 mountain and @entity95 on the border between @entity1 and @entity37			1
scientists estimate he was aged around 45 , was 5ft 5 " tall and weighed about 7.9st when he died			2
@entity16 is kept in a specially built museum in @entity58 , @entity37			0
visitors view the mummy through portholes into a specially refrigerated room			2
the hunter was frozen with all his possessions including a bow , a quiver of arrows and a copper axe			0
he was wearing warm clothing including a cloak made of woven grass , a coat and leggings made from goatskin and a bearskin cap with a leather chin strap			0
dna analysis has revealed details of the iceman 's life the 5,300 - year - old ' ice mummy ' known as @entity16 suffered from the world 's first - known case of @entity129 , a bacterial parasite spread by ticks , according to new dna analysis			1
@entity16 , who was 46 at the time of his death and measured 5ft2 , also had brown eyes , had relatives in @entity136 , and was lactose intolerant			0
@entity16 was also predisposed to heart disease			0
the new research focused on the dna in the nuclei of @entity16 's cells , and could yield further insights into the famous ' ice mummy 's life			1
he was unearthed in september 1991 by a couple of @entity72 tourists trekking through the @entity148 , after which he was named			2
he was about 46 years old when he met his death			0
the iceman has been crucial to our understanding of how prehistoric people lived , what they wore and even what they ate			0
researchers examining the contents of his stomach worked out that his final meal consisted of venison and ibex meat			0
archaeologists believe @entity16 , who was carrying a bow , a quiver of arrows and a copper axe , may have been a hunter or warrior killed in a skirmish with a rival tribe			0
researchers say he was about 159cm tall ( 5ft 2.5in ) , 46 years old , arthritic and infested with whipworm , an intestinal parasite			0
his perfectly preserved body is stored in his own specially designed cold storage chamber at the @entity175 in @entity37 at a constant temperature of -6 ° @entity177 can view the mummy through a small window			2
alongside his remains is a new @entity16 model created using 3d images of the corpse and forensic technology by two @entity186 artists – @entity187 and @entity188 .			0

@entity1 scientists tested the dna of 3,700 male blood donors in @entity11
they matched a genetic mutation to the mummy found back in 1991
