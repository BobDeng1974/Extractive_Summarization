after keeping a clean sheet during 180 minutes of football against @entity4 this season @entity1 goalkeeper @entity0 knows a thing or two about stopping the world ’s most expensive forward line			1
when @entity4 drew 0 - 0 at @entity9 earlier in the season they failed to muster a shot on target and @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 were frustrated again on saturday			0
‘ we knew that @entity4 are very good at getting in behind teams and reaching the byline so we were very aware of trying to send them inside at every opportunity so that they could n’t hurt us down the wings , ’ the goalkeeper said after his side ’s 1 - 0 victory			1
@entity1 goalkeeper @entity0 has kept out @entity4 for 180 minutes this season @entity0 dives to save a shot from @entity15 as @entity1 beat @entity4 1 - 0 at the @entity27 on saturday @entity4 forward @entity15 jumps in frustration after bein foiled by @entity1 goalkeeper @entity0 @entity1 set up with two banks of four players and left very little space for @entity4 to play between the lines			1
the tactic proved so effective that at times @entity36 ’s side resorted to hitting long diagonal balls into the box , which proved meat and drink for the 6ft 1in keeper @entity0			0
there was plenty of food for thought for @entity46 but @entity4 defender @entity47 dismissed the idea his @entity50 team could use the @entity1 blueprint on how to beat @entity4			2
he said : ‘ @entity46 was at @entity1 before ( for three seasons as manager from 2010 ) and i think they still have some of the habits that he instilled there , but @entity50 have very dangerous forward players and i do n’t think they will close up at the back the way @entity1 did			0
’ @entity0 ( left ) jumps and attempts to get the ball from @entity4 defender @entity64 ( right ) @entity0 jumps in for a ball with @entity4 striker @entity15 in an attempt to punch away			0
