@entity1 and @entity2 stars look back on the biggest upset in modern @entity5 final history the birth was chaotic and messy			1
it was the summer of 2002 , and hundreds of pub footballers were descending on @entity9 , famous for the @entity10 and as the former training ground of the @entity12			1
@entity1 , @entity5 winners in 1988 , were going back to their roots			1
having seen an @entity5 - appointed panel agree to relocate the club to @entity18 and , left without a team to support , a few crazy idealists and disenfranchised fans had the idea of re-forming and starting again at the bottom of the football pyramid , in the @entity23			1
the only problem was they had no players			1
‘ it was unbelievable , ’ said @entity26 , who tried out that day and ended up as captain and one of the leading lights at the new club			1
‘ it was like no other trial i ’ve ever seen			1
you had 400 people turning up			1
i do n’t know how you can tell how anyone is any good from that			2
there were games going off all over the place			2
’ @entity42 ( left ) holds off @entity44 's @entity43 during @entity1 's @entity5 first round win former @entity1 player @entity46 will lead @entity1 out against @entity2 in the @entity5 third round @entity1 have won five promotions in 12 years to earn the right to play @entity2 in the @entity5 again @entity50 , then a partner at @entity51 , and now the chief executive of the club and one of those deluded idealists , was also present			1
‘ some people were there who could scarcely stand on one leg and swing the other			2
but they can say they trialled for @entity1 , ’ he said			1
yet on sunday that same club will face @entity2 in the @entity5 third round , a repeat of their most famous hour in their former guise , when the old @entity63 beat mighty @entity2 in the 1988 final			1
a visit to training — no longer on the @entity68 but at a proper sports ground — reveals a pristine pitch , a raft of support staff for manager @entity46 , including a chef for post-training meals and a sports scientist , as well as thriving under - 21 and under - 18 teams			2
then there is the first team , who sit comfortably in mid-table in @entity81			2
this is a club rebuilt			2
more poignantly , 23 years after the club left their old home of @entity85 in @entity1 — the club played at @entity87 for 12 years before the owners moved the franchise in 2003 — they are on the verge of returning			1
when @entity2 visit they will play at the 4,720 - capacity @entity91 in @entity93			1
the old @entity1 ground is now a block of flats , but a proposal to redevelop a greyhound stadium a few hundred yards from that site into a 11,000 - capacity community stadium would take @entity1 back home — if @entity102 approve			1
@entity1 pulled off one of the greatest shocks in @entity5 history by beating @entity2 in the 1988 final @entity1 captain @entity107 guesses right to save a penalty from @entity2 striker @entity109 @entity110 glances home a header for what was ultimately the winning goal at @entity114 it is difficult to ascertain who has the more remarkable story : the old @entity1 who rose from the @entity119 to win the @entity5 and become a consistent force in the newly - formed @entity121 ; or this new incarnation , who , in 12 years and five promotions , have earned the right to compete against @entity2 again			1
both are powerful narratives of the underdog , and the @entity2 game is a staging point in the journey			1
‘ it ’s a landmark , ’ said @entity50 who works for just a guinea a year			2
‘ randomly choosing our significant moments , there are those trials at @entity9 , our first game against @entity139 , getting into the @entity23 , winning the league , getting into the @entity141 , getting to third round of the @entity5 for the first time , and now playing a @entity121 side competitively for the first time			1
‘ it ’s another step on the march to getting back to where we feel we can justify and support ourselves , ’ he said			2
‘ for me , that ’s the @entity152			2
for a fan - owned club to get to the @entity152 and survive and challenge for the @entity121 , that would be as big an achievement as going from @entity23 to @entity141			2
what has happened is incredible in the proper grammatical sense of the word			2
’ @entity1 were formed in 2002 after @entity1 's move to @entity18 @entity1 line up for the first time after staging trials at @entity9 the hurt of having their club wrested from them to @entity18 still leaves a scar			1
‘ i can not bring myself scarcely to mention the name @entity18 , let alone go there , ’ said @entity50			2
‘ but what i find really helpful is to channel the anger i still feel about that injustice into something positive			2
there ’s no point seeking schadenfreude			2
i try not to look at their results , try not to care			0
i just try to make sure we get the benefit of all that energy that needs to go somewhere			0
’ perhaps the healing began this season when @entity1 beat @entity18 in the @entity185 , their first victory over the franchise club in three attempts			1
‘ when we beat @entity18 that meant so much to me , ’ said manager @entity46			0
‘ i went in the dressing room after the game and screamed at the top of my voice			0
and some of players were like : “ wow ! the gaffer ’s normally calm			0
” but i wanted to be that person who said : “ there you go guys ; all that hurt			0
” i wanted to be that person and i was			0
and i wanted to get to the @entity5 third round and get a good draw and i ’m so proud because everyone ’s buzzing			1
’ the real battles are in @entity81 , where 16st @entity208 is their iconic striker , a cult figure in the video game @entity211 15 , while @entity212 , 35 , provides the midfield leadership			0
@entity46 is @entity1 to the core			1
he joined the club as an 11 - year - old , was a 16 - year - old @entity218 trainee when they won the @entity5 and progressed to play in a @entity121 side who consistently finished in the top eight			1
he vividly recalls the club ’s most famous day			0
‘ i remember that @entity2 team , i was a follower of them , it was breath - taking , the football they played and the players they had			1
and to get little old @entity1 playing them on a big pitch at @entity114 and them going for the double ... it probably was and always will be the biggest shock in the @entity5 you ’ll see			1
’ @entity233 celebrates during @entity1 's victory over @entity235 in the @entity236 @entity1 will rely on cult hero @entity208 when they come up against @entity2 ( @entity238 ) @entity237 , @entity239 and @entity240 train ahead of their @entity5 third round clash @entity46 only left when the old club terminated his contract due to financial problems			1
‘ on my first day i walked in fresh out of school and was given a paint pot and got told to paint the physio room			0
and you think : “ i ’m here to play football			0
” you do n’t say it , but you think it			0
and then the first - team players came in and kicked the paint pot on the floor and said : “ you ’d better pick that up			0
” ‘ i thought : “ what have a let myself in for ? ” if you looked at someone the wrong way you could get taken into a room and given a little bit of a showing or what not			0
it was a little bit of a clump , knocked around a bit			0
and if you kept quiet about it you ’d get a pat on the back few days later and someone would say : “ you ’ll do for us , you have n’t gone crying to the teacher , so to speak			0
” ‘ if [ manager ] @entity272 caught you with your hands in your pockets you would have to do 60 - second laps			0
there were a lot of people who looked at that and said : “ this is not for me			0
” ’ yet there was more to @entity1			1
in an 11 - year spell , between 1986 and 1997 , they finished in the top eight of the old @entity284 and the new @entity121 six times			0
the lowest they finished was 14th			0
the new @entity1 are very different			1
they are owned by supporters and community involvement is at the heart of the club			0
and having been scarred by the debts and mixed motives of investors in the past , @entity1 run a balanced budget and do not pay huge wages			1
@entity46 admits he wondered what he let himself in for when he first joined @entity1 as a player the @entity1 boss sees a new stadium as essential to getting the club in the championship a significant break with the past is that the long ball is not @entity46 ’s style			1
‘ i do n’t want @entity305 fighting football , ’ said @entity46			0
‘ i have to find the right balance to make sure we have enough steel and strength about us to cope with the demands of the league and at the same time have a bit of philosophy when we ’ve got that the ball			0
we ’re certainly not long ball			0
’ a return to their @entity85 roots for @entity320 would complete the circle for @entity46			0
‘ a new stadium takes us to a whole new level , with the players you can attract , players you can afford , ’ he said			0
‘ if we have aspirations of becoming a @entity152 club eventually , it ’s a must			0
we drove past the site the other day on our way to give out presents at @entity334 and , without being disrespectful , it ’s a bit of an eyesore			0
it looks tired , it looks dated			0
and if you regenerate that and make it a real hub of sport , how much better would that look ? ’			0
