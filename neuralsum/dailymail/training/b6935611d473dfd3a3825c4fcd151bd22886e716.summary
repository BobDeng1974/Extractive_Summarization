warning : cabinet secretary sir @entity0 took aim at ' lazy ' civil servants who survive year after year thousands of civil servants are ‘ lazy ’ and have been allowed to remain unchallenged in their jobs for years , @entity4 ’s top mandarin admitted today			1
sir @entity0 , the cabinet secretary , said the bottom 10 per cent of civil servants were below par and could be sacked unless they raise their game			1
it means that up to 40,000 of the 400,000 or so officials across central government could face being managed out as a result of their ‘ performance problems ’			2
the move comes as ministers approved a large increase in the number of politically appointed civil servants			1
the @entity23 says the establishment of ‘ extended ministerial offices ’ – stuffed with officials personally appointed by cabinet ministers – is necessary to ‘ put a rocket ’ under @entity29			2
senior @entity31 figures have accused mandarins of dragging their feet over implementing vital reforms and hope the expanded private offices , staffed by those loyal to ministers , will force top civil servants to raise their game			0
however , the reforms will lead to accusations that the government wants to politicise the @entity41 and end its proud tradition of independence			2
the changes could also lead to a rise in the number of special advisers , who report directly to a minister and do not have to be politically independent			1
these so - called ‘ spads ’ could even lead the new offices as a minister ’s ‘ chief of staff ’			1
however sir @entity0 said the shake - up also needed to identify @entity29 's worst performers			1
he said : ‘ there is a willingness to identify the top 25 per cent of people and give them proper rewards , but just as important – more important in some ways – the bottom 10 per cent , and give them an opportunity to improve themselves or , if not , move them out			0
‘ nothing annoys good civil servants more than seeing lazy civil servants surviving year after year without anyone addressing that performance problem			0
‘ addressing performance management is a huge way of motivating the rest			0
’ improvements : ministers hope that the reforms will force civil servants to up their game when the @entity23 came to office in 2010 , the @entity78 pledged to cut the number of special advisers			1
since then , however , @entity82 has become disillusioned with the pace of reform , and he believes that permanent secretaries , the bureaucrats who lead government departments , have too much power			2
earlier this year , @entity88 , mr @entity82 ’s former director of strategy , attacked ‘ paper - shuffling mandarins ’ who pushed through changes without ministerial approval , often resulting in the prime minister learning about @entity40 decisions from the media			0
former prime minister @entity97 later joined the attack , saying that the @entity41 was ‘ hopelessly bureaucratic ’ and ‘ not fit for purpose ’			0
reform plan : @entity101 is behind the scheme to increase the number of politically appointed civil servants the reforms follow the decision earlier this year by cabinet office minister @entity101 to ask the @entity107 , a centre - left think tank , to examine the workings of civil services in other @entity112 - speaking countries – including @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 – and find out if there were ways to improve the @entity4 system			1
the think - tank concluded that , in comparison to politicians in the other countries , @entity4 ministers were under - supported			0
mr @entity101 will today announce that he has accepted the @entity107 ’s recommendations to allow ministers in charge of departments to set up the ‘ extended ministerial offices ’			0
these offices will comprise a mixture of civil servants and special advisers , all appointed directly by the minister , rather than by the permanent secretary in charge of the department			1
some staff will be appointed from outside the @entity41 on short - term contracts to ensure that they do not kowtow to the permanent secretary			1
however , all staff will have to abide by the @entity41 code			2
@entity142 , associate director of the @entity107 , said : ‘ in comparative terms , @entity4 ministers have relatively little direct support to draw on to enable them to do their jobs effectively			0
strengthening ministerial offices will make @entity29 more responsive and more effective			0

cabinet secretary sir @entity0 takes aim at *coasting* staff
changes could lead to an increase in the number of special advisers
