@entity2 winners @entity0 could arrive in @entity3 this summer with arguably the most fearsome pace attack in test cricket since the ferocious @entity7 sides of the 1980s			1
less than 48 hours after claiming their one - day prize , the @entity8 turned their attention on the summer 's @entity12 series			1
while captain @entity13 might have marked sunday 's final triumph over @entity15 by confirming his retirement from the 50 - over game , his desire for test cricket success burns as bright as ever			1
@entity0 celebrate after winning the @entity2 in @entity20 on sunday @entity13 was still recovering from a day - long champagne party with fans on the streets of @entity20 when the @entity8 confirmed their squad to play a test series in the @entity7 before arriving in @entity3 for the start of the ashes in july			1
and if @entity29 still have nightmare memories of the way they were blown apart by the pace of @entity33 as they suffered a 5 - 0 whitewash in @entity0 , then there is a new nightmare to come			1
@entity0 could have as many as four bowlers who have all logged speeds of 90mph plus in their line - up , with both @entity33 and his @entity2 pace partner @entity40 in the squad			1
@entity2 hero @entity42 is the glaring omission despite starring on @entity0 's run to the final they will be backed up by @entity47 , who misses the @entity7 trip to stay home for the birth of his first child but will then join up in time for the @entity12			1
while 24 - year - old @entity54 is also not on the list because he is currently out with a damaged left hamstring , he will also be monitored with the chance to be included in time to travel to @entity3			1
@entity13 will lead a side anxious to rub away bitter memories of their last @entity12 tour when they were beaten 3 - 0 in 2013			1
@entity2 batting hero @entity59 , who averaged only 38 in that series , is a far improved batsman now and will be expected to get big runs			1
@entity62 , axed from the early @entity63 and sent away in disgrace after throwing a punch at @entity66 in a nightclub , will also want to make his mark on the series			0
national selector @entity70 told cricketaustralia.com.au : ' the test team has performed very well in recent times , but the big challenge is to do that away from home			2
' we believe this squad has sufficient depth for these important test matches against the @entity7 and @entity3 and will give us the best chance of success			1
' two players who starred in the @entity2 campaign , @entity42 and @entity84 , were tipped for the squad but have missed out			1
@entity33 's pace bowling terrorised @entity3 as @entity0 ran out 5 - 0 victors last year ' @entity87 and @entity88 had sensational seasons at domestic level and their performances just could n't be ignored			1
they thoroughly deserve their call - up and the opportunity to be a part of this squad			2
we believe that both can play important roles in the side if required			0
' @entity87 had one of the great seasons in @entity104 history			0
he is an experienced player and quality character who will add talent and leadership to the touring party			0
' @entity88 has worked incredibly hard on his game and has demonstrated throughout the season that he can be a consistent wicket taker			0
' @entity112 has been on our radar for some time and deserves his opportunity through weight of runs and performances behind the stumps			0
he has also demonstrated impressive leadership qualities which have caught our eye			0
' @entity13 ( capt ) age 33 caps 108 verdict age has not diminished his class , as he proved in the @entity2 final			2
but his dodgy back could be an issue in a five - test series			2
should out - captain @entity131 once more			2
@entity62 age 28 caps 36 verdict could win a test or two by himself if he bats for a couple of sessions			0
@entity139 ’s off - breaks will be crucial in pinning him down			2
likes to say a word or two			0
@entity141 age 33 caps 56 verdict has a decent record in @entity12 cricket , but has never reached the stage where he frightens @entity3			2
but his medium - pace balances @entity0 ’s team in a way @entity131 can only envy			1
@entity150 age 31 caps 12 verdict a gritty left - hander , and son of former test opener @entity154			2
@entity157 career with 141 in @entity158 in 2011 , but success has been sporadic since then			0
@entity33 age 33 caps 64 verdict if @entity3 have n’t got over the trauma of the 2013 - 14 series , when @entity33 took 37 wickets at 13 apiece , the @entity12 will stay with @entity0			1
@entity166 age 24 caps 3 verdict one of a batch of promising @entity8 fast bowlers , he proved economical beyond his years during the successful @entity2 campaign			1
a flawless action bodes well			0
@entity84 age 24 caps 1 verdict played his only test to date at @entity176 in 2013 , where he got up @entity3 ’s noses by accusing them of boring batting			2
a left - arm seam - bowling all - rounder , he can give the ball an almighty whack			0
@entity54 age 24 caps 13 verdict injuries have limited him since he burst on to the scene in 2011 - 12 , but the talent is undeniable : tall , aggressive and fast , he should trouble @entity3 more than his brother , @entity191 , when playing for @entity3 in a single test against @entity193 in 2008			1
@entity194 age 30 caps 56 verdict the banana - loving seamer is a veteran of two @entity12 tours , and could provide relentless accuracy while the quicker bowlers fire around him			2
@entity200 , for one , found him almost impossible to score off in 2013 - 14			0
@entity201 ( wkt ) age 37 caps 63 verdict @entity0 ’s second-most important cog in their 5 - 0 @entity12 wheel in 2013 - 14 , after @entity33			1
his sledging from behind the stumps is considered the heartbeat of the team			0
@entity209 age 37 caps 20 verdict this will be his last hurrah in a late - blooming @entity157 career			0
calm , compact and the perfect foil for the exuberance of his opening partner @entity62			0
@entity59 ( vice captain ) age 25 caps 26 verdict one of world cricket ’s rising stars , he scored four tons in @entity0 ’s recent home series against @entity223			1
will captain the side full - time after @entity13 retires , and can burgle the odd wicket with his leg - spin			0
@entity227 age 27 caps 39 verdict a steady off - spinner who troubled @entity3 ’s right - handers during whitewash			1
but , really , they should have nothing to fear			0
@entity40 age 25 caps 15 verdict another left - arm seamer , and @entity237 at the @entity2			1
his yorkers are as dangerous in @entity63 as they are in @entity239 , and accuracy and pace have improved			0
@entity47 age 35 caps 27 verdict if he can drag his injury - laden body through one final series , @entity0 will be thrilled			1
he was an unsung star during their 3 - 0 defeat here two years ago , and produced the ball of the series to bowl @entity131 in @entity250			1
@entity166 age 24 caps 3 verdict one of a batch of promising @entity8 fast bowlers , he proved economical beyond his years during the successful @entity2 campaign			1
a flawless action bodes well			0
@entity88 age 33 caps 20 verdict the @entity259 - born leg - spinner has played only three one - day internationals and two @entity263 games for @entity0 , so would represent a risk			1
but @entity8 leggies have done well in @entity3 before … @entity13 ( capt ) age 33 caps 108 verdict age has not diminished his class , as he proved in the @entity2 final			1
but his dodgy back could be an issue in a five - test series			0
should out - captain @entity131 once more			0
@entity62 age 28 caps 36 verdict could win a test or two by himself if he bats for a couple of sessions			0
@entity139 ’s off - breaks will be crucial in pinning him down			0
likes to say a word or two			0
@entity141 age 33 caps 56 verdict has a decent record in @entity12 cricket , but has never reached the stage where he frightens @entity3			2
but his medium - pace balances @entity0 ’s team in a way @entity131 can only envy			1
@entity150 age 31 caps 12 verdict a gritty left - hander , and son of former test opener @entity154			0
@entity157 career with 141 in @entity158 in 2011 , but success has been sporadic since then			0
@entity33 age 33 caps 64 verdict if @entity3 have n’t got over the trauma of the 2013 - 14 series , when @entity33 took 37 wickets at 13 apiece , the @entity12 will stay with @entity0			1
@entity194 age 30 caps 56 verdict the banana - loving seamer is a veteran of two @entity12 tours , and could provide relentless accuracy while the quicker bowlers fire around him			2
@entity200 , for one , found him almost impossible to score off in 2013 - 14			0
@entity306 age 23 caps 4 verdict a rangy all - rounder and younger brother of @entity150 , @entity70 stunned @entity3 during the @entity2 with figures of 5 for 33 at @entity20 – despite having taken only six odi wickets until then			1
his batting is the stronger suit			0
@entity112 age 29 caps 0 @entity316 who ? @entity112 has been chosen as the reserve wicketkeeper behind his @entity320 team - mate @entity201 , although he has also played as a specialist batsman for his state team			2
unlikely to get a game unless @entity201 breaks a finger			0
@entity87 age 35 caps 0 verdict an outsider for a test debut , but he knows @entity330 conditions well – @entity87 has spent time with @entity332 , @entity333 and @entity334 – and bowls left - arm spin to complement his middle - order hitting .			2

@entity3 welcome @entity0 for the ashes on home turf this summer
@entity2 winners include pace bowlers @entity33 and @entity40 in their squad
@entity3 are looking to reclaim the urn after last year 's 5 - 0 whitewash
