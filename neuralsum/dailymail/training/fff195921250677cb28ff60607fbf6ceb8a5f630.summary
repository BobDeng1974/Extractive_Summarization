@entity0 struggled with the cop who killed him and tried to grab the officer 's gun , a report has claimed			1
@entity5 - the police officer in @entity6 , @entity7 , who shot the teenager - has told investigators he feared for his life when he opened fire			1
he claims he was trying to get out of his police car when @entity0 pushed him back into the driver 's seat and reached for his gun through the open window			1
eventually , @entity5 said , he pulled his gun from the holster on his right hip , fired two shots , and one hit @entity0 's arm - leaving his blood smeared inside the car and on his uniform			1
however the account leaked to the @entity41 last night stops there , and does not explain why @entity0 was then shot four times outside the car			1
a number of witnesses agree that @entity0 and @entity5 were embroiled in a physical fight through the car window , but few had an accurate vantage point to see what was happening			1
they insist , however , the teenager was trying to flee and holding up his hands			0
one passer - by , @entity53 , is certain @entity0 was leaning away but @entity5 kept pulling him closer			2
another , @entity54 , said @entity5 grasped @entity0 's throat and then pulled out his gun threatening to shoot			2
they then heard shots fired from inside the suv			0
there remains no account from witnesses or police of the final four shots fired			0
according to @entity5 's description of the august 9 shooting - revealed for the first time today - @entity0 made him fear for his life			1
' self defense ' : @entity6 police officer @entity5 says he feared for his life as he shot @entity0 police officers are generally given more scope for lethal force if they reasonably believe that their life is in imminent danger			1
investigators are now examining the officer 's claim that the teenager physically assaulted him as a grand jury considers whether he is guilty of a number of crimes including : first - degree murder , second - degree murder , voluntary manslaughter or involuntary manslaughter			1
city officials claim there is still not enough evidence to charge @entity5 with violating civil rights			0
in september , officer @entity5 appeared before a @entity89 grand jury , which was convened to determine whether there is probable cause that he committed a crime			1
his willingness to testify surprised many			0
however , his account of feeling vulnerable will be a significant boost in his favor as the grand jury considers its verdict before the deadline of january 7			2
nine of the 12 jury members will have to vote against @entity5 in order for charges to be leveled			2
they are expected to vote by mid-november			0
@entity89 prosecuting attorney @entity104 could have bypassed the grand jury stage and simply taken the case to trial by filing a charge against @entity5			1
he could also have filed a complaint to a judge who decides if there should be a trial			0
however , @entity104 chose to take the full investigation of @entity5 â€™s use of deadly force to the grand jury , leaving the 12 members to decide			1
according to the @entity41 , the leaked account of his version of events did not come from the @entity121 or from officials whose activities are being investigated as part of the civil rights inquiry			0
people claiming to have witnessed the shooting have given wildly different accounts of what happened			0
some have said that some the young man had his arms raised over his head while others claim that @entity5 shot him while his back was turned and he was running			0
the police have maintained that the unarmed teen physically assaulted the officer and tried to get his gun			0
one witness , whose name has been withheld , from @entity142 , @entity7 , told the grand jury that the teenager did not have his hands above his head when @entity5 shot at him , but rather ' out to his sides			1
' @entity0 , 18 , was shot six times by @entity148 in the middle of a @entity6 , @entity7 , street			2
his death prompted outrage in the community and resulted in several investigations he also said @entity0 ' staggered toward @entity5 despite commands to stop ' and that ' the two were about 20 to 25 feet apart when the last shots were fired			2
' protests in @entity7 have continued ever since the shooting amid claims it was unjustified - and an extreme example of police brutality in the town			0
civil rights groups say @entity0 's death is part of a national epidemic in which a disproportionately high number of unarmed black men are fatally shot by white police officers , an allegation police deny			0
officials said that the evidence given so far did not support civil rights charges against officer @entity5			2
to press charges , the @entity176 would have to prove that he wilfully violated @entity0 's rights when he shot him .			0

officer @entity5 claimed he and @entity0 struggled in his police car
he told investigators that the teenager *pinned* him and reached for the gun
at that point , he claims , the gun was fired twice and hit @entity0 in the arm
but @entity5 does not explain why he was shot four times outside the car
it is his first *publicly* released account of the shooting on august 9
