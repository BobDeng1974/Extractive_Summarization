@entity0 has one regret concerning @entity2			1
it is not that he did n’t return to @entity4 this summer , nor that he will be facing the @entity5 in the blue of @entity7 on sunday afternoon			1
it is that the two of them never experienced winning a trophy together at @entity4			1
they both grew up at the club			2
they became and remain great friends			2
and they are neighbours in north @entity16 , living almost next door to each other			2
but @entity0 remembers great years at @entity4 which ultimately ended up as memories of what might have been			1
@entity0 and @entity2 celebrates during a 2 - 1 @entity22 win against @entity23 in 2007 the duo rejoicing after coming back from 2 - 0 down to beat @entity26 3 - 2 in 2008 then @entity4 players @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity2 , @entity0 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 take tea at @entity16 's @entity35 before meeting the @entity36 in 2007 ‘ i came here when i was 20 and he was couple of years younger , so it ’s been 10 years now , ’ says the @entity37 , recalling his first meeting with @entity2			1
‘ in that time , we ’ve experienced a lot			2
we were in the @entity44 final together in 2006			2
i ’ve been fighting for him for many years			2
‘ when we were together here we had a great partnership on the pitch			0
he was more offensive and i was more defensive , working hard for him			0
( on sunday ) i will probably mark him and that will not be easy first of all because he is a good player but also because he is a friend			2
there was that @entity44 final in 2006 , where @entity0 came on for @entity2 as a substitute when 10 - man @entity4 were 1 - 0 up with 16 minutes to go			1
two late @entity58 goals scuppered what would have been an extraordinary night			0
then there was the 2007 - 08 season , when @entity4 were five points clear at the top of the @entity22 in february before a 2 - 2 draw at @entity65 in which @entity67 ’s horrific broken leg seemed to break their resolve			1
@entity69 and @entity0 have won trophies together ? ‘ of course , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ like i said , when i came back to @entity4 from @entity72 , it was unfinished business , because i always had in my heart , in the back of my mind , the @entity44 final of 2006			1
‘ then also , in 2008 , we were top of the league until late in the season , and we collapsed			0
we lost one player , a bad injury to @entity67 , so that is a bad memory i keep in the back of my mind			0
‘ it was difficult , because we lost it easily			0
in 2008 we had such a strong team and i ’m frustrated because of that			0
i think in my mind i want to clear that up , that ’s why i came back to win titles			0
we started last year , with the @entity94 , and we have big ambition this year			0
’ it will be hard for @entity4 fans to see @entity2 in blue on sunday afternoon , especially given the superb start he has made			1
‘ it will be strange for everybody , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ but it was his decision to go to @entity7			1
he ’s a good friend of mine so whatever decision he made , i support him			0
he is a big player			0
’ @entity108 will be wearing @entity7 blue when he plays against @entity4 on sunday and the @entity110 has got off to a cracking start to his @entity7 career with the club still unbeaten this season the arrival of the likes of @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 prevented the return of @entity108 for @entity7 , the addition of @entity2 feeding chances to @entity122 has added a layer of fluency to their attacks which was missing last season			1
‘ he ’s one of the best midfielders in the world , ’ says @entity127 , another beneficiary of @entity2 ’ presence			1
‘ @entity122 is right in front of me and it ’s very good to play with them			0
it ’s easier to play with them			0
i was happy ( when he signed )			0
i play football to play with the best and these are the best players in the world			0
’ you would imagine @entity4 must now have some regrets , given the option was there to re-sign him			1
‘ of course , ’ says @entity127			0
‘ when you can get @entity2 and he goes to another team , you must be frustrated a little bit			1
’ of course , @entity4 have @entity118 , @entity117 , @entity31 , @entity149 and @entity150 in central attacking roles			1
@entity153 ’s decision not to pursue @entity2 more determinedly makes perfect logical sense			1
it is just that emotionally it feels wrong			0
@entity2 is likely to play in a more attacking role today , rather than the deeper position he has filled so far			1
@entity159 may look to bolster his midfield with a more defensive player than the @entity110 , something @entity153 never seems to be prepared to do			0
@entity7 ’s 6 - 0 massacre of @entity4 at @entity164 last march , which came in @entity153 ’s 1000th game for the club , saw the @entity4 manager start with a midfield of @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity117 , which proved hopelessly inadequate			1
the default excuse for that result is that @entity174 was sent off ( mistakenly , it should have been @entity170 ) after 15 minutes			0
yet by then it was already 2 - 0 and the red card was for a hand ball on the line preventing the third goal			1
the subsequent penalty would make it 3 - 0			1
the sending off had represented the end of the contest , not the turning point			0
@entity0 sat on the bench that day and could only look on , until @entity153 brought him on at half time , belatedly acknowledging his error			1
@entity0 says : ‘ we collapsed too quickly			2
after 10 minutes we were already 2 - 0 down			1
@entity153 admitted he made mistakes during @entity4 's 6 - 0 defeat at @entity7 in march @entity192 is mobbed by his team - mates after he scored @entity7 's second with just seven minutes gone @entity174 was mistakenly shown a red card by referee @entity196 with only 15 minutes gone @entity4 players stand dejected as the @entity7 team celebrate their sixth goal of the game ‘ we have learned from our mistake , we are gaining maturity , we have some quality in the team and we go there with a lot of confidence			1
’ @entity153 surely ca n’t approach the game with the same tactics which have seen his side swept aside by @entity7 time and time again			2
in the last 10 years , since @entity159 took over at @entity7 for the first time , @entity4 have played their @entity16 neighbours 24 times			1
they have won three , drawn six and lost an incredible 15 times			2
@entity153 has never beaten a @entity159 team			0
@entity0 believes today can be different			1
‘ when you go there , and you lose the way we did last year , it ’s on your mind , ’ he admits			2
‘ ( on sunday ) we go there , we give everything			2
it ’s important for every single one of us but also for the fans			0
i ’m sure they remember what happened last year and we really want to make it up			0
’ for hazard , of course , there are only good memories			0
‘ it was fantastic , ’ he says			0
but the @entity233 is also looking beyond the derby			0
‘ we are first and we hope at the end of the season we can stay there , ’ he says			0
‘ i need a trophy			0
i came to @entity7 for trophies			2
’ from @entity7 players such statements about the title ring true ; from @entity4 players , much less so			1
@entity153 needs to regain credibility in these big games			0
when the two rivals face each other on sunday , we will discover whether there has been any real tactical evolution over the summer or whether it is merely ‘ plus ca change ’ , as @entity153 might say			2

@entity0 admits to having regrets over what might have been with @entity108
the @entity37 believes the duo should have won *silverware* at @entity4
@entity4 set to travel to face @entity2 and @entity7 on sunday
their last visit to @entity164 ended in a 6 - 0 defeat in march
