a plastic surgery patient dubbed the ' @entity1 ' got $ 6,000 worth of procedures at a @entity4 clinic before walking out without paying			1
the man , who gave his name as @entity7 and said he was 43 , was given botox , fillers and laser treatment by dr @entity11 at his 77 @entity13 clinic			1

police are hunting for this man , who gave his name as @entity18 and said he was 43 , after he walked out of a @entity4 plastic surgery clinic without paying for $ 6,000 of treatment dr @entity11 told @entity22 that the man gave his address as 1140 folsom street , but that has since turned out to be an office building			1
he then recalled an email a colleague had sent him in april last year warning that a ' @entity1 ' had struck in the area			0
the description in the email matched his patient			0
the bizarre theft began with a consultation , during which mr @entity11 met with the customer in his surgery and discussed procedures with him			2
in hindsight , the surgeon says he should have known something was wrong , as the patient seemed to be acting suspiciously			0
he said : ' he was a little bit secretive and a little bit private about coming into the office			2
he also seemed to know quite a bit about what he wanted done			0
looking back there was some red flags			0
' dr @entity11 said after the theft he remembered a colleague had sent him an email warning of a ' @entity1 ' in the area matching the description of his patient when it came to payment , dr fan said he usually asks for a credit card , but in this case the patient showed him a wadge of cash instead			1
despite his reservations @entity62 went ahead with the three procedures which are all designed to combat the signs of ageing			0
however , after the treatments were done , and with his face still puffed up and red from the surgery , the man strolled out while pretending to be talking on the phone			1
dr @entity11 said that he wants his story to act as a cautionary tale for other surgeons in the area			1
he added : ' hopefully this kind of thing wo n't happen to many people , and hopefully this particular person wo n't be able to continue to get away with this			0
