a great - grandfather left with a gaping hole in his face due to cancer treatment has been given the devastating news his condition is terminal			1
@entity6 , 64 , has facial angiosarcoma , a cancer of the inner lining of blood vessels			1
he has already undergone a series of operations , the first of which took surgeons 12 hours to remove a tumour from his face			2
but the cancer returned and he required more treatment , as well as procedures to remodel his nose and face			1
a few months ago he developed a huge wound under his right eye , and doctors planned surgery to remove another tumour			2
@entity6 , 64 , has been told the cancer that has destroyed his face is incurable and there is nothing more doctors can do			1
he is pictured before being diagnosed ( left ) and afterwards ( right ) mr @entity6 developed a spot on his face in 2012 , which began to spread			1
he was diagnosed with facial angiosarcoma , a cancer of the inner lining of blood vessels in 2013 the cancer returned and mr @entity6 developed a gaping hole under his right eye			1
he is pictured with his family ( from left to right ) , grandson @entity38 , 17 , wife @entity39 , 63 and daughter @entity41 but surgeons discovered the cancer had spread to such an extent that there is nothing more that can be done			2
all they can do is help change his bandages and keep him as comfortable as possible			0
now , mr @entity6 and his family are speaking out to raise awareness of angiosarcoma , in the hope his story can help others			2
mr @entity6 's daughter @entity54 , 42 , said : ' they 've told us nothing more can be done now			2
' we only hope that @entity59 's story raises awareness and prevents anyone else undergoing what he has had to suffer			0
' mr @entity6 is now housebound at his home in @entity64 , @entity65 , where he is cared for by wife @entity66 , 63			2
his problems began when he noticed a spot on his cheek in 2012 , but thought nothing about it			0
' it all started with just a spot and it was nothing special so i did n't worry about it , ' mr @entity6 said			2
' but the spot started to spread so i went to see a gp and it was first thought that it could be a rash or infection and i was given a course of antibiotics			0
' however , the antibiotics did not work and because his face got worse , he was sent to hospital for tests			0
@entity87 is a relatively rare soft tissue tumour			0
it usually occurs in the head , neck , and especially in the scalp of elderly people			0
its presentation varies from a small plaque to multifocal nodules			0
the treatment depends on the extent of the disease , but most cases are treated with wide excision - a surgical procedure to remove a small area of diseased or problematic tissue with a margin of normal tissue - and reconstruction			0
radiotherapy and chemotherapy are advocated in recurrent or extensive abnormalities in tissue			0
source : @entity113 ' never in a hundred years , could i have imagined that i would be told i had cancer , ' mr @entity6 said			2
medics at @entity65 's @entity117 took a skin biopsy from mr @entity6 and experts identified that he had a rare form of cancer that was affecting a large part of his face			1
there was no other option than to perform a 12 - hour - long life - saving surgery to remove the tumour			1
this involved taking skin from mr @entity6 's thigh , grafted onto his face			1
the operation completely changed his appearance			0
' i knew that the operation had to be done , so i just had to get on with it , ' he said			0
' when i was going home from hospital i thought ' i do n't want to look in the mirror '			0
it was a few weeks before i had a proper look at myself and i did get frightened as it looked like i had a bandage on my face			0
' following the operation , doctors were optimistic that they had removed the whole tumour and mr @entity6 underwent an intensive course of chemotherapy in the hope of killing any remaining cancer cells			1
but , just six months later , the facial angiosarcoma returned and once again he required further treatment at the region 's @entity151			1
in 2014 mr @entity6 underwent a 12 - hour operation where surgeons removed a cancerous tumour and took skin from his thigh to graft on to his face mr @entity6 is now cared for at his home by his wife @entity66 , 63			1
he hopes that through telling his story he will raise awareness to this rare form of cancer after a series of operations to remodel his face and nose , mr @entity6 believed his life was back on track and he could accept his new appearance			1
but in recent months a wide and painful hole began to develop under his right eye , as the cancer had once again returned			1
after initially preparing for surgery to remove another tumour , mr @entity6 was dealt the devastating blow that the cancer had spread too rapidly for treatment to be successful			1
the wound has grown and deteriorated rapidly over recent weeks mr @entity6 's eyes bleed constantly , and he has to have his bandages changed regularly			0
his family have rallied around him to support him , and he now hopes , through telling his story , that others will become more aware of angiosarcoma and its devastating effects .			0
