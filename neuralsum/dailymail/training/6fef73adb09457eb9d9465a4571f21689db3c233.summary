by @entity0 published : 12:43 est , 18 february 2014 @entity2 : 15:02 est , 18 february 2014 asian elephants comfort distressed members of their group with reassuring trunk touches and sounds that could be the equivalent of a human soothing a baby , scientists have revealed			1
it is the first clear evidence of elephants displaying ' consolation ' behaviour , previously only demonstrated in great apes , dogs and some crow species			2
scientists spent a year watching a group of 26 captive @entity21 elephants at a camp in northern @entity23			1
fancy a hug ? researchers found that in the elephant world , tapping another animal with the trunk is a way to comfort them - and the equivalent of a hug in humans the researchers recorded instances when one of the animals was distressed or frightened , for example by a snake rustling in the grass , a passing dog , or an unfriendly elephant			1
typically , when this happened a nearby elephant would walk over and gently touch its upset colleague with its trunk , or put its trunk in the other animal ’s mouth			1
the ' trunk in the mouth ' gesture is the elephant equivalent of a handshake or hug , according to lead scientist @entity55 , from @entity56 in @entity23			1
' it ’s a very vulnerable position to put yourself in , because you could get bitten , ' said dr @entity55 , who is chief executive of the non-profit conservation organisation @entity60			0
' it may be sending a signal of ‘ i ’m here to help you , not hurt you ’			0
supportive elephants also tended to vocalise , often producing a high chirping sound			2
' i ’ve never heard that vocalisation when elephants are alone , ' dr @entity55 said			2
' it may be a signal like , ‘ shhh , it ’s ok ’ , the sort of sounds a human adult might make to reassure a baby			0
' reassuring : if an animal was alarmed , a nearby elephant would walk over and gently touch its upset colleague with its trunk , or put its trunk in the other animal ¿ s mouth , the researchers found			1
in addition , elephants responded to distress signals of other group members by displaying similar emotional signals - a likely sign of empathy			1
groups of nearby elephants were also more likely to bunch together and make physical contact			2
dr @entity55 compared them to humans watching a scary movie moving closer to each other and holding hands			2
professor @entity97 , from @entity98 in @entity99 , @entity100 , who took part in the research reported in the online journal @entity104 , said : ' with their strong social bonds , it ’s not surprising that elephants show concern for others			0
' this study demonstrates that elephants get distressed when they see others in distress , reaching out to calm them down , not unlike the way chimpanzees or humans embrace someone who is upset			1
' the key to consolation behaviour is empathy - the ability to put yourself emotionally into another individual ’s shoes , said dr @entity55			0
this requires complex thinking , which is why it is so rarely seen in animals , he believes			0
in contrast , ' reconciliation ' behaviour that provides a way to repair broken relationships in social groups has been seen in many more species			0
dr @entity55 and @entity135 previously conducted research showing that elephants can recognise themselves in mirrors and co-operate to solve problems			0
' humans are unique in many ways , but not in as many ways as we once thought , ' dr @entity55 added .			0

scientists spent a year watching a group of 26 captive @entity21 elephants
animals touch their friends with their trunk , or place the trunk in their mouth to calm them
say gesture is the equivalent or a hug or handshake in humans
animals also ' chirped ' or *tweeted* a comforting noise
