@entity0 today warned @entity2 leaders they had ' a problem ' if they objected to being asked to do more to tackle @entity5 extremism			1
the prime minister said letters sent to mosques were ' reasonable , sensible and moderate ' and ministers were ' absolutely right ' to insist everybody had a responsibility to fight radicalisation			1
it came after the @entity14 accused the government of ' ratcheting - up tensions ' and adopting the language of the far - right			1
in the letter , communities secretary @entity36 and minister @entity37 write : ' we must show our young people , who may be targeted , that extremists have nothing to offer them			1
' we must show them that there are other ways to express disagreement – that their right to do so is dependent on the very freedoms that extremists seek to destroy			2
' the letter ends : ' we welcome your thoughts , ideas and initiatives on how to ensure that @entity28 's true message of peace triumphs over those who seek to divide our communities			1
' but some @entity2 have expressed anger at the ministers ' challenge to show how @entity28 can be part of @entity34 identity			1
after the letter emerged this morning , the @entity14 said it wanted mr @entity36 to clarify his request and asked if , like ' members of the far right ' , he was suggesting that @entity28 is inherently apart from @entity34 society			1
deputy secretary - general @entity67 said : ' we will be writing to mr @entity36 to ask that he clarifies his request to @entity2 to ' explain and demonstrate how faith in @entity28 can be part of @entity34 identity '			1
' is mr @entity36 seriously suggesting , as do members of the far right , that @entity2 and @entity28 are inherently apart from @entity34 society ? ' the letter was sent by communities secretary @entity36 and minister lord @entity72 of @entity73 @entity2 commentator @entity74 went further , tweeting : ' ridiculous and unhelpful intervention from the @entity36 , @entity36 this morning , by asking all @entity2 to prove themselves			1
' government ministers , rather than ratcheting - up tensions and fuelling the fifth column narrative , should be looking to unite communities			2
' but asked about the criticism this morning , mr @entity0 insisted the letter was ‘ reasonable , sensible and moderate ’ and suggested that anyone opposing it ‘ really has a problem ’			1
answering questions after a speech in @entity20 , the prime minister said : ‘ i think it is absolutely right to write this letter , to say that we all have a responsibility to fight extremism			2
‘ anyone who reads this letter - and i 've read the letter - will see that what he is saying is that @entity34 @entity2 make a great contribution to our country , that what is happening in terms of extremist terror has nothing to do with the true religion of @entity28			1
‘ it 's being perverted by a minority who have been radicalised			0
but everyone needs to help with dealing with this problem of radicalisation			2
‘ anyone , frankly , reading this letter , who has a problem with it , i think really has a problem			2
i think it is the most reasonable , sensible , moderate letter that @entity36 could possibly have written			1
‘ frankly , all of us have a responsibility to try to confront this radicalisation and make sure that we stop young people being drawn into this poisonous fanatical death cult that a very small minority of people have created			0
’ @entity124 in north @entity125 has attempted to tackle the extremists which once worshipped there the letter was published after mr @entity36 and home secretary @entity130 held up signs reading ' i am @entity133 ' during a @entity134 meeting yesterday mr @entity0 's intervention came after lord @entity37 had earlier rejected the criticism and insisted the letter was clear			1
he told @entity139 's today programme : ' within the letter there is an explicit paragraph that says @entity34 values are @entity2 values			1
you ca n't be more explicit than that			0
' he added : ' perhaps he was n't clear in what the letter said but if you have seen a copy of the letter ... it has been pretty explicit that we want to work together with the @entity2 community			1
' this was about reassurance , it was about recognising , as @entity130 said only yesterday , that a @entity34 without @entity2 , a @entity34 without @entity133 , @entity157 , would not be the @entity34 we want to see			1
' the letter slams far - right groups like the @entity161 ( pictured ) , but some @entity2 say ministers appear to use the same language as such groups by suggesting @entity34 and @entity2 identity is distinct mr @entity36 has previously written to @entity2 leaders to offer support after arson attacks on mosques by far - right groups , but the latest letter is the first time he has challenged them to tackle extremism			1
the letter emerged the day after the @entity176 announced it is reviewing how to keep its officers safe amid fears of a terror plot to kidnap or kill a policeman or woman			0
home secretary @entity130 also promised to increase the government 's efforts to tackle the terrorist threat and a ' chilling ' rise in @entity186			0
@entity187 , we have recently seen terrible atrocities committed in @entity190			0
finding the right response to these events is a challenge for everyone			0
the hijacking of a great faith to justify such heinous crimes sickens us all			0
as muslims around the world have made clear , such actions are an affront to @entity28			0
and yet , amid the carnage , came a sign of hope – over three million people of all backgrounds , marching to defeat the gunmen and to protect our values : free speech , the rule of law , and democracy			0
we are proud of the reaction of @entity34 communities to this attack			1
@entity2 from across the country have spoken out to say : not in our name			2
but there is more work to do			0
we must show our young people , who may be targeted , that extremists have nothing to offer them			0
we must show them that there are other ways to express disagreement : that their right to do so is dependent on the very freedoms that extremists seek to destroy			0
we must show them the multitude of statements of condemnation from @entity34 @entity2 ; show them these men of hate have no place in our mosques or any place of worship , and that they do not speak for @entity2 in @entity34 or anywhere in the world			1
let us assure you that the government will do all we can to defeat the voices of division , but ultimately the challenges of integration and radicalisation can not be solved from @entity248 alone			1
strong community - based leadership at a local level is needed			0
@entity253 , as faith leaders , are in a unique position in our society			0
you have a precious opportunity , and an important responsibility : in explaining and demonstrating how faith in @entity28 can be part of @entity34 identity			2
we believe together we have an opportunity to demonstrate the true nature of @entity34 @entity28 today			2
there is a need to lay out more clearly than ever before what being a @entity34 muslim means today : proud of your faith and proud of your country			2
we know that acts of extremism are not representative of @entity28 ; but we need to show what is			0
@entity34 values are @entity2 values			1
like all faiths , @entity28 and its message of peace and unity makes our country a better and stronger place , and @entity34 would be diminished without its strong @entity2 communities			1
every day , mosques and other faith institutions across the country are providing help for those in need , and acting as a centre for our communities			2
it is these positive contributions that are the true messages of faith and it is these contributions that need to be promoted			0
we would also like to reassure you that in recent days we have met with police chiefs to make sure they are providing the support that mosques need , a concern that some of you have expressed in our recent discussions			0
we have also met with the @entity302 to hear their concerns about responses to the recent attacks and what more can be done			0
anyone experiencing violence should report it to the police online on the @entity312 website or to tell @entity313 , a service to provide support specifically to @entity2 victims of hatred			2
the vitriol espoused by the thugs of the @entity161 and @entity320 is just as much an affront to @entity34 values as the teachings of preachers of hate			1
for organisations experiencing problems with such preachers , information about free legal advice is available from @entity331 at www.lawworks.org.uk/community-groups or the @entity333 at www.barprobono.org.uk , and the @entity335 has published a toolkit for charity leaders to help protect their organisations from abuse by extremists			0
we welcome your thoughts , ideas and initiatives on how to ensure that @entity28 's true message of peace triumphs over those who seek to divide our communities			0
thank you for all the positive work you are doing , and we look forward to working with you further			0
we continue to appreciate all your insights			0
