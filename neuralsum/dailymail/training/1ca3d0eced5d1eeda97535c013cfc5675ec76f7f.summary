she was freed from the wreckage in the @entity24 near @entity25 , @entity26 , but died in hospital shortly after			1
a breath - test two hours after the accident , which happened around 3.40am on july 6 last year , found he was almost twice the legal alcohol limit with a reading of 61mgs/100mls			1

his elderly grandparents were also present			0
judge @entity42 told @entity43 : ' i want to extend my sympathies to the tight - knit @entity11 family and extended family			1
' it is clear the grief your thoughtless actions have inflicted upon them and the support they have given you in letters that are effectively asking mercy for you			2
' i must look at the matter not just from the point of view of the @entity11 family and friends but from the public gain			2
' and to try to ensure that we wo n't have more young people with cars driving relations and friends home after they have had far too much to drink for it to be safe for them to do so			2
' the judge added : ' i take into account you 're 23 years of age and your clean driving record for four years up until the time of the accident and your remorse			1
tragic : @entity13 , 19 , became trapped in the van when it overturned in the @entity24 , near @entity25 ' and i take into account your attempts in the icy water to try to free your sister , and your vulnerability in prison			1
' i am forced to consider a suspended sentence but my answer is no. ' the sentence upon you is to 20 months imprisonment but you will serve 10 of them with good behaviour			0
' i disqualify you from driving for the minimum level i can while taking in the job you have been offered and the need to drive it around for work			2
' defending , @entity96 said @entity98 feels ' unbearable guilt when he looks his parents in the eyes			0
' he said : ' the defendant no longer drinks			0
he has in fact stopped socialising since the awful event			0
' it was a momentary lapse of concentration			0
' it was one moment 's impulsiveness , that decision to drive , that decision to drive his sister @entity13 home , to make sure she got home , ironically , safely			1
' i do fear i ca n't adequately convey the shame and guilt he feels , the shame and the hatred he will carry with him for the remainder of his life			0
' this is the burden he carries and that 's the burden he will continue to carry			0
@entity2 managed to break free and called for help , but @entity13 died later in hospital on july 6 last year ' the burden manifests itself in the physical anguish born from the loss of his sister			1
and the obvious unbearable guilt when he looks his parents in the eyes			0

they said : ' words can not begin to convey how devastated we are at the loss of our beautiful @entity13			1
' she was a popular , caring and loving young woman who loved her friends , her family and having fun			2
' she 'd just become a doting auntie and was doing a magnificent job supporting her sister looking after her little nephew			2

' after the case accident investigator pc @entity158 said : ' this is an extremely tragic case which has clearly had a devastating impact on all of the family			0
' justice must be done and the sentence has been passed however there can be no greater punishment than knowing you are responsible for your sister 's death			0
