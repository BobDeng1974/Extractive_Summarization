but for @entity5 the black @entity6 , just the mere mention of walkies is enough to make him hide behind the sofa			1
the one - year - old puppy suffers from agoraphobia after he was electrocuted and is now terrified of going outside			2
scaredy dog : @entity5 has to be dragged through the streets of @entity12 , @entity13 , by his owner because he is too scared to leave the house the once curious dog had been investigating smells in @entity12 , @entity13 , when he touched a metal drain which had an electric current flowing through it due to a fault in the power supply of a nearby street light			1
despite taking strong medication since the incident , the terrified pup now has to be dragged around the streets of @entity12 because he is scared stiff to leave the house			1
owner , @entity28 , 36 , said : ' i was just taking him for his usual walk when he suddenly jumped off the pavement onto the road and just went mental ' since then , when you head out of the door to take him for a walk , he 's just not having it			1
' if you try to cross the road or go anywhere else then that 's it , he digs his heels in and he wo n't go - you 've got to drag him			2
' no go area : a worried @entity5 peers out of the doorway of his home in @entity12 too scared to go outside with his owner @entity28 miss @entity28 's children , @entity48 , two , and @entity49 , 13 , are desperate for their pet to recover to his usual playful self			1
she said : ' the boys are both really upset at what has happened to @entity5			1
' @entity48 would always play with him , climb on him and pull at him and @entity5 would n't bat an eyelid , but not now			1
' the vet gave me a special powder to through @entity5 's food for 20 days and it calmed him down a bit , but now he 's finished his course , he 's worse than ever			1
' when he had that electric shock i 'd never seen him react like that before			1
he 's a black @entity6 , which is the most docile dog you can get			1
' walkies : @entity28 's son @entity68 with her black @entity69 ( left ) and @entity28 with @entity5 ( right ) forlorn : @entity71 is too terrified to leave his owner 's home after he was electrocuted in @entity12 the faulty street light behind @entity5 's woes is operated by @entity13			1
miss @entity28 , a director of a cleaning and maintenance company , said : ' we were n't the only ones to be affected by this , there were other people i 've spoken to who had the same problem with their dogs before @entity5 got an electric shock			1
' the dog warden and a health and safety officer checked out the pavement on december 28 and they decided that there was nothing wrong			2
' the council only cordoned off the area on the 29th and as far as i 'm concerned if there had been complaints before then , there should have been more investigation into what was causing it			2
' scene : @entity104 in @entity12 where @entity105 suffered an electric shock but a spokesman for @entity13 insisted it was not aware of the hazard before @entity5 was shocked			1
' the hydro board called us out about it on november 29 , which was after the complainant 's dog suffered an electric shock			1
' the place was then cordoned off at nine o'clock that night			2
' in conjunction with @entity119 , the fault was identified and rectified as a matter of urgency			0
' @entity119 discovered the drain had become electrified because of a fault in the power supply to the street lights			0
the fault had caused the power to short circuit down a drain pipe which leads to the metal drainage channel that runs across the pavement			0
a spokeswoman from @entity119 added : ' the issue was resolved on the evening of december 3			0
' it was n't an electrocution , but the dog would have suffered an electric shock which obviously is very unfortunate , but i can confirm that the area is safe now			1
' @entity5 still suffers from agoraphobia despite taking drugs for the condition dogs can experience a variety of emotional and psychological disorders which can occur or are caused by either negative experiences , medical problems or by how the dog has spent the first weeks of its life			2
@entity149 is however , rare in dogs , especially when you consider how much they like to go for walks			0
but some canines are sensitive souls and can have fears and phobias , including fear of new places or situations , fear of unfamiliar people and or other dogs			0
the most common fear related problems are noise phobias , involving thunder , gunshots and fireworks			0
there are drugs which can be prescribed to combat these kind of behaviours including agoraphobia , anxiety , aggression and for mood stabilisation			0
the phobias or fears in agoraphobia for humans involve activities such as leaving home , entering public places or travelling alone			0
in these situations the person feels especially vulnerable and exposed , with nowhere to escape to or hide if things go wrong			0
an unusual but not uncommon feature of agoraphobia is a fear of crossing bridges , known as gephyrophobia			0
this is related to a feeling that , once on the bridge , there is no immediately available exit			0
the degree of fear and avoidance behaviour varies			0
although many sufferers do manage to get out to work , some become completely housebound			0
@entity149 typically affects women and begins in early adulthood			0
they may have other psychological problems too , especially anxiety , depression , depersonalisation , panic attacks and obsessive behaviour .			0
