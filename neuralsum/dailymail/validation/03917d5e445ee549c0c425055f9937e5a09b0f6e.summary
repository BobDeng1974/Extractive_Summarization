@entity0 is an artist and a pragmatist rolled into one and the @entity4 fly - half is quickly discovering that the latter trait is a more consistently valuable asset in international rugby			1
the 21 - year - old @entity9 playmaker spends most weekends with his club demonstrating the range of his attacking game — as a creative rookie able to unravel defences at close quarters			0
he has shown that part of his repertoire during this @entity19 , but is also having to embrace the earthier demands of his role , involving substance over style			1
@entity4 ’s defeat by @entity25 in @entity26 gave @entity27 a first - hand view of @entity29 , the home fly - half , following orders to the letter and quelling his own instincts in the process			1
the @entity35 10 led an aerial onslaught which the visitors failed to handle			0
@entity0 is prepared to sacrifice style over substance in the quest for victories at international level @entity27 and team - mate @entity43 are put through their paces at @entity45 on wednesday asked whether he would feel fulfilled if ordered to kick so often , @entity0 said : ‘ it was obviously @entity25 ’s plan			1
if they come in with a plan and execute it as well as they did and come out with a 10 - point win , then you would ( feel fulfilled )			0
you do n’t always have to play the same way against different teams			0
‘ you go into a game with a plan and if it comes off at the weekend , you feel you ’ve done your job			2
’ but surely he gains more satisfaction from conjuring tries than kicking for territory ? ‘ people always like to score tries , ’ he added			1
‘ they are more exciting			2
but they are difficult to get in international rugby			2
‘ it ’s about small margins , little things ; your kicking being on the money , your set - piece and breakdown being strong			1

’ the substance versus style issue will be on the agenda again in assessing how @entity4 fare on saturday against @entity76 at @entity87 , where they will be expected to win with plenty to spare against opponents who have lost all three games so far			1
@entity0 knows the result is the bottom line , but is aware the hosts need to perform with a flourish too			2
‘ we ’re not going into the game to play averagely , ’ he said			2
‘ we ’re going into the game looking for a really good performance			0

@entity101 and foremost we need the win			0
it ’s vital we get it			0
but obviously we want to go out there and put in a good performance and have a good reaction			0
