@entity5 – who it is claimed pushed the fourth official during his protest - felt that assistant @entity2 did not support him enough over the incident and words were exchanged			1
@entity2 ( left ) points at the fourth official as @entity5 ( right ) is sent to the stands on saturday @entity23 challenges goalkeeper @entity24 ( in yellow ) in the incident which incensed @entity5 what a difference a few days can make			1
on saturday , @entity5 and @entity2 appeared on the @entity29 's @entity28 together and sang each other 's praises ... @entity32 on @entity5 : ' @entity5 wanted someone who knew the club , who knew the fans , who knew the league , who could help him with things that perhaps he did n't know about			1
' @entity5 on @entity32 : ' when we played against @entity43 i did n't know the team , i did n't know the players			2
i did n't know a lot of things and he is the person who helps me with these kind of things			0
he helps with training sessions and he is very , very important for me			0
' that led to tuesday ’s surprise news that the popular former @entity3 midfielder – who was not with @entity5 and his backroom team at sunday ’s @entity55 - would be leaving his position with immediate effect			1
a club statement read : ‘ following discussions between @entity2 , head coach @entity5 , and the club , all parties have agreed for @entity2 to leave his position with immediate effect			1
‘ the club would like to place on record its thanks for @entity2 ’s efforts since joining us from @entity65 last season and wish him all the best for the future			2

afterwards , the former @entity73 defender said : ‘ i do n't know if i can say everything i am thinking i might have a problem ( with the authorities )			0
@entity2 has left his job as @entity3 assistant manager with immediate effect @entity2 had been working as no 2 to former @entity73 assistant manager @entity5 ( centre ) ‘ the first thing i want to do is apologise for my behaviour because my behaviour has been bad and @entity3 does n't deserve my behaviour , so i want to apologise , but i am going to fight for this club to the last second and put in 100 per cent myself every day			1
‘ but it was a moment that i was very frustrated because when you are working , when you are fighting for 93 , 94 minutes and you have your objective in your hand			0
‘ it 's amazing , i ca n't believe my keeper is on the treatment table			0
@entity32 ( right ) made more than 150 appearances for @entity3 between 1992 and 1998 ‘ someone asked me if i had seen the image ( replay ) and i said i watched the image but i did n't need to because @entity24 is on the treatment table and i do n't know if he is going to play in the next game			0
‘ the referee , two linesman , the fourth official - everybody in the stands and on the bench could watch the foul – except those four people , that 's the interesting thing for me			0
