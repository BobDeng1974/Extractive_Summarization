by @entity0 published : 09:55 est , 11 july 2013 updated : 02:35 est , 12 july 2013 former director general : @entity2 claimed the @entity3 was aware of a controversial payoff worth almost £ 1million given to a senior executive the @entity3 ’s former director general @entity2 yesterday accused its governing body of misleading mps over a £ 949,000 severance payoff to one of its top executives			1
a war of words – described by mps as a ‘ soap opera ’ – exploded between mr @entity2 and the @entity3 as emails emerged that cast doubt on the evidence given by its chairman @entity19 to a @entity21 inquiry			1
@entity22 told the public accounts committee on wednesday the @entity3 had not been given details of the massive payment to former deputy director @entity26 , who was made redundant in 2010			1
asked whether he felt he should have been told the details of the deal , @entity22 said : ‘ yes , and if you call in due course the previous director general of the @entity3 i will be as interested as you are as to why we did n’t know			1
’ however correspondence has now emerged showing mr @entity2 , head of the @entity3 executive at the time , informed the @entity3 that @entity26 and his colleague @entity35 , director of marketing , would be given ‘ maximum payments ’			1
an email from his office , dated october 8 , 2010 , stated they would not be served formal notice of their redundancy until ‘ calendar year 2011 ’ , despite being informed of their departure months earlier			0
the revelation triggered a war of words between mr @entity2 and the @entity3 – prompting the public accounts committee chairman @entity49 to brand the whole affair a ‘ soap opera ’			2
she said : ‘ there are serious accusations flying around about whether or not the director general was open and honest with the @entity3 , and counter-accusations about whether the @entity3 was open and honest with us			1
‘ it is becoming a soap opera , and we need to get to the bottom of it			0
’ hearing : asked yesterday why he did not know some payoffs had gone beyond what was contractually needed , @entity22 appeared to suggest to the @entity64 that mr @entity2 should give evidence miss @entity49 said she now plans to hold a fresh inquiry with a raft of current and former executives – including mr @entity2 and former chairman sir @entity69 – expected to be called as witnesses			1
the hearing follows a devastating report by the @entity73 , which found the @entity3 handed out £ 369million to its staff over eight years			2
in it , the @entity76 deal was held up for special criticism			0
the @entity73 found he was wrongly paid £ 474,500 for 12 months ’ ‘ pay in lieu of notice ’ , despite serving eight months of his notice period on full pay			0
it meant he was effectively paid twice for that period and pocketed almost twice what he was contractually entitled to			0
@entity22 admitted to mps the @entity3 had been made aware of the pay - off in mr @entity2 ’s email , but claimed it had been assured it was ‘ within contractual terms ’			1
but yesterday , mr @entity2 , who left the @entity3 in september to become ceo of the @entity91 , accused the trust of ‘ inaccuracies ’			1
a close friend said he was ‘ gobsmacked and surprised ’ to hear @entity22 ’s evidence			0
big payoff : former deputy director general @entity26 left the @entity3 after 31 years of service with around £ 950,000 when his post closed mr @entity2 said the @entity3 was ‘ fully informed in advance , in writing as well as orally , about the proposed severance packages for @entity26 and [ marketing director ] @entity35 ’			1
he added : ‘ specifically , they were told it was proposed that in both cases formal notice would not be served immediately but in the following year … i had made sure the @entity3 were aware of and understood all potentially contentious issues			2
@entity106 had every opportunity to express any concerns about the proposals before they were approved			0
’ trust member @entity110 had told @entity86 yesterday that members of the @entity3 were not always included in decision - making			1
appearance : @entity3 member @entity110 ( front right ) had told the @entity64 that members of the @entity3 - chaired by @entity22 ( centre right ) - were not always included in decision - making mr @entity2 , who had been expected to appear before the public accounts committee in november , is now likely to be called to give evidence earlier			1
a @entity3 spokesman said : ‘ the material being quoted today was shared with the @entity73 in the course of their review			0
they noted that the @entity3 had no role in the approval process but were being given this material for information and to provide assurance that payments to @entity26 and @entity35 were to be made on the basis of contractual terms			2
‘ the @entity73 ’s conclusions were the basis for our evidence given to the pac yesterday and like the @entity73 , we see nothing in this correspondence which disproves any of their conclusions			0
’ salary : @entity142 was branded as ' disingenuous ' about her own pay @entity145 ’s director of human resources was branded as ‘ disingenuous ’ about her own salary while giving evidence to mps			0
@entity150 signed off many of the most contentious pay - offs , including the @entity26 deal			2
when @entity49 quizzed her on her own £ 320,000 salary , she said she had accepted a ‘ significant drop ’ to join the @entity3			0
however , documents seen by the @entity156 reveal she was given a ‘ higher level of guaranteed salary ’ than in her previous job as @entity159 head of legal firm @entity160			0
yesterday , @entity164 mp @entity163 said : ‘ do i find it surprising some witnesses are somewhat disingenuous ? no. ’ minutes from the @entity3 remuneration committee in february 2009 said : ‘ although the total proposed is lower than the package @entity170 can currently potentially earn , it has a higher level of guaranteed salary and lower element of variable pay			2
’ miss @entity150 told mps she felt ‘ uncomfortable ’ signing off the @entity26 deal , but said it was in line with a ‘ pervading culture ’ , adding : ‘ i think as an organisation we made a number of decisions which were not in the best interests of the licence fee payer			0

@entity2 takes issue with claims @entity3 was **n't** aware of package
former deputy director general @entity26 left after 31 years of service
@entity3 told @entity64 that members were **n't** always included in decision - making
@entity2 says he *'s* ' looking forward ' to telling @entity86 facts about payoffs
