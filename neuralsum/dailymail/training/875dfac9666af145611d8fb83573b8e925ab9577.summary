the pensioner spoke out as calls grew for a review into the so - called @entity20 ( @entity20 ) , which is widely accepted as a way of allowing those at the end of their lives to die with dignity			1
@entity20 's objective is to ensure that a dying person is treated in his or her last days with as much comfort as possible by ruling out potentially distressing interventions aimed at prolonging their lives			1
but critics say while in some cases it has been used properly as intended , with numerous others it has become , instead , a backdoor form of euthanasia			0

' to me it felt like she was put onto death row and left to die in a side room			1
' the retired train driver added : ' i would never have let her go to hospital if i had known what i do now			0
' after finding out she was on the pathway , we offered to take her home to die but was told we could n't			2
' it is widely used in @entity16 , @entity57 and @entity58 , both in hospitals and hospices and supported by health - related charities			2
but concerns have grown that it is being used inappropriately			0
tens of thousands of patients are placed every year on the pathway			2
the scheme aims to ensure that the ' right type of care is available for people in the last days or hours of life when all of the possible reversible causes for their condition have been considered '			2
but mr @entity1 said : ' i got the feeling the quicker she went the better because it would stop them looking after her for another week			1
' i really do n't think it is right for doctors to play @entity84 and put people on this plan			2
' devastated : @entity1 and his daughter @entity87 have complained to the hospital they claim left @entity2 to die in a side room @entity90 was taken to hospital on june 19 after collapsing with low blood sugar levels			1

but her family was not told when she was actually placed on the system			0
mrs @entity107 , of @entity118 , @entity16 , said : ' when we were told she was on the pathway plan , they said there was nothing more they could do for her			0
' they said they would make her as comfortable as possible and free from pain but they really did n't explain what was actually going to happen			0
' she staged a heartbreaking vigil at her fast - fading mum 's bedside for the last two weeks of her life			1
the cause of mrs @entity99 's death was put down as a heart attack , pulmonary oedema , diabetes and cerebrovascular disease			1
the angry family have now complained to @entity14			0
