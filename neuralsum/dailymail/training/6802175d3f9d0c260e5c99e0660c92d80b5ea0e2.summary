trainer @entity0 says unbeaten @entity1 will arrive at the starting line for the @entity3 a much fitter horse than the one which extended his unbeaten record to seven races with an easy three and a half length win in the @entity10 at @entity11 last month			1
@entity13 ’s champion trainer also believes that @entity15 ’s mount will also have no problem with the two - mile @entity18 test , one of the sharpest examinations of speed a hurdler can face			1
jockey @entity15 says @entity1 will have no problem with the two - mile @entity18 test @entity1 , whose opponents include @entity26 winner @entity24 , won the two - mile @entity29 novices ’ hurdle at @entity30 in april but every other time he has raced over hurdles it has been over further			1
over @entity33 last year at @entity34 , he won at three miles			0
he landed the two mile five furlong @entity36 ’ @entity35 at last season ’s @entity37 and the @entity10 is over two miles three furlongs			2
@entity0 said : ‘ it is another big step up for him			1
we are going into @entity24 ’s home ground — a flat right - handed track will suit him but he is in good order			2
‘ a lot of the time we raced over a longer trip because we were keeping him apart from the other horses ( like @entity49 ’ @entity10 winner @entity50 )			0
i knew he would stay but i knew he could come back in trip all right			0
@entity1 will take on @entity26 winner @entity24 in the @entity3 ‘ this year he has come back a hundred weight heavier			1
i was really worried with the size of him when he went over to @entity11			0
@entity58 , who stood in for me , passed a remark to @entity15 that he had never saddled a horse to win a race like that which was as fat as he was			1
‘ if he can do that with that sort condition on him , there must be huge improvement for him for the rest of the season			2
’ @entity1 is 4 - 9 to win the @entity3 and 2 - 1 to win the @entity72 despite the impressive performances of @entity74 in @entity75			1
@entity0 admitted that @entity1 ’s swift elevation to being regarded as one of the most exciting horse in jump racing has wrong - footed him			1
he added : ‘ he has surprised me that he is as good as he is			0
he was very ordinary point - to - pointer			2
to look at him last season he was so raw and scrawny , you wondered if he ’d have the strength to run two mile five furlongs at @entity37			0
‘ he was skin and bone whereas @entity50 was the apple of everyone ’s eye			0
he is an oil painting of a horse			0

trainer @entity0 claims unbeaten @entity1 is in peak condition
he says @entity15 *'s* mount will have no problem with two - mile test
