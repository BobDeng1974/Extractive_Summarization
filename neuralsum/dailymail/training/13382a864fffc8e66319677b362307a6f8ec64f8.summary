the @entity0 is managed by a group of men and women who are brilliant at three things			1
the first — and easily the most important — is persuading their superiors their job is vital to the well - being of the @entity9 even if no one is quite sure what that job actually is			1
the title offers little help			2
the grander it is , the less it means — but it will almost certainly contain the words ‘ strategic ’ , ‘ governance ’ or ‘ director ’			2
parodying @entity0 : @entity20 and the cast of @entity22 , which @entity0 veteran @entity23 has lauded their second is avoiding taking any decision for which they can be held responsible			1
they do this by surrounding themselves with clever young people who do all the work and get all the blame when something goes wrong			2
if it goes right , naturally the director takes the credit			2
and their third is to demonstrate by thought , word and deed their unswerving loyalty to the man at the top of the organisation : baron hall of @entity48			2
@entity23 , presenter for the today programme on @entity50 , believes the @entity0 has always been over-managed not that he is ever accorded that title			1
he is referred to only as ‘ @entity52 ’ , the better to give the impression they are the closest of friends and @entity56 hangs on their every word			2
their principal activity is holding endless meetings at which nothing is decided , but a great deal of time and coffee are consumed and an even greater deal of management jargon is spoken			2
the more opaque and meaningless the jargon the better			2
that way , accountability can be avoided and responsibility ducked			2
if no one really understands what the hell is going on , no one can be held to account for anything			2
their contact with the real world beyond @entity22 is limited , if not non-existent			2
now at this point dear reader ( or should i address you as ‘ dear licence - fee payer ’ ? ) , you ’ll be wondering why i , as a more or less loyal servant of the @entity0 , have decided to sign my professional death warrant with such a savage attack on the organisation that has provided me with a pretty decent living for nigh on 45 years			1
the answer , as you may have guessed , is that the @entity0 i have described is a fictional organisation			1
it is the creation of some clever scriptwriters for a new @entity92 comedy series beginning tonight and starring @entity93 as @entity94 , ‘ head of values ’ at the @entity0			1
the last time we saw @entity94 was in @entity97 — that wicked satire on the people who brought us the @entity100			0
this sequel is very funny , too , unless you are a @entity0 boss in real life			1
in which case you might , perhaps , worry that your critics will view it more as fact than fiction			0
you might also worry how the more humble mortals who work for the @entity0 , and have never risen through the ranks to breath the intoxicating air of the senior management corridors , will view it			1
i ’d be lying if i said there were n’t some of my colleagues who will be punching the air the morning after the programme is broadcast and shouting : ‘ spot on ! they ’ve got the bosses bang to rights ! ’ it would be odd if they did n’t			1
@entity23 ( pictured ) believes that the @entity0 is no different from any organisation , arguing that many corporations have too many bosses and staff that think higher - ups are too overpaid i doubt there is a large organisation anywhere in the world where senior management is loved by all ( or even most ) of its workers			1
or where the workers do not think there are too many overpaid bosses			1
why should the @entity0 be any different ? i am on record as saying the @entity0 is over-managed			1
when i joined the @entity0 in the @entity140 , i was told my patch would be the @entity142 of @entity143 and was ordered to set up my base in @entity145			1
i was to work out of @entity146 , an office building in the heart of the city , where the @entity149 of the @entity0 was based			1
the representative ( i can never think of him without the capital letter ) was a dapper little fellow called @entity152 but only to his closest friends			0
to young pond life like me , he was @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 ( @entity158 ) and he was a very grand figure indeed			0
@entity160 had an extremely large office with a well - stocked cocktail cabinet and two elegant young secretaries			1
not one , you will note , but two			0
their duties , it is fair to say , were not onerous			0
' @entity168 ) @entity169 ( @entity170 ) , @entity171 ( @entity172 ) , @entity173 ( @entity174 ) , @entity94 ( @entity20 ) , @entity175 ( @entity176 ) , @entity177 ( @entity178 ) , @entity179 ( @entity180 ) @entity160 graced the office a couple of times a week to sign a few letters and occasionally drove up the coast to @entity186 for lunch with ‘ my friend , the mayor of @entity186 ’ in his large plum - coloured @entity189 and white cotton driving gloves before returning to his home in the @entity194			1
perhaps @entity160 ’s relationship with his honour and one or two other municipal worthies in the @entity142 was , as he insisted , invaluable to the well - being of the @entity0			1
whether it repaid the considerable sum forked out by the unwitting licence - payer is debatable			1
and he was not alone			0
there were many of them here and abroad			0
our representative in the @entity207 , where i was later sent to open a television news bureau , had a far grander suite of offices in @entity212 and an apartment in the @entity214 with stunning views over the @entity216 that would not have disgraced a @entity218 prince			0
all that was more than 30 years ago			0
the representatives have long since been given their marching orders and many similar anachronistic posts abolished — not , it must be said , without a fight			0
the grand offices have gone , too			0
even some of the most senior bosses in @entity228 must slum it with the rest of us			1
but there are still plenty of places to hold meetings and @entity236 knows they are kept occupied			0
the @entity0 bureaucracy is alive and kicking			1
and it ’s not just me saying that			0
it ’s @entity243 , too			0
one of the first trips he made when he became director general was to the @entity207 to see the @entity248 and @entity249 operations			0
back in @entity255 , he wrote this : ‘ to launch an initiative , one of our colleagues had to speak to two people at @entity248			0
‘ to get agreement to do the @entity0 ’s first @entity259 , someone at the @entity0 had to speak to more than two dozen			1
’ there ’s not a programme - maker in the @entity0 who would n’t say @entity265 ! to that			1
back in the @entity268 , i returned from filming a famine in @entity270 with some powerful material			0
i rang the office of the controller of @entity274 , @entity275 , and asked his secretary if he could find the time to look at it because i thought it would make a decent documentary			0
half an hour later , i was sitting in @entity275 ’s office			0
he put his feet on the desk and watched the first ten minutes			0
‘ ok , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’ll get it scheduled for a few weeks ’ time			0
’ and so it was			0
that same process 30 years later would take many months and almost as many meetings as @entity289 held to plan the d - day landings			1
mercifully , @entity243 wants to change that			0
he says the @entity0 ’s meeting culture ‘ hampers creativity ’			1
he wants to halve the number of @entity296 boards and steering groups — a ‘ bonfire of the boards ’ , in his words — to speed up decision - making and ‘ release some of the resources wasted on bureaucracy for programmes			2
’ anyone who thinks it will happen overnight does not know the @entity0			1
yet tonight ’s programme is an encouraging sign			2
an organisation that can take the mickey out of its own management quite so ruthlessly shows it ’s got the message			0
and that ’s a start .			0

@entity23 argues that the @entity0 is over-managed , and always has been
also says it is no different from any *company* when it comes to bosses
claims that @entity321 , the new @entity0 self - parody , is a good sign for its image
