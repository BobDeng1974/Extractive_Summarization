the @entity1 , sensing a legislative defeat was nigh , today said president @entity2 would be willing to meet @entity4 half way and sign legislation codifying its role in processing a nuclear deal with @entity8 if a @entity10 committee axed key portions of the bill during a formal review this afternoon			1
senators later voted 19 - 0 to give the @entity1 some of , but not all of its asks , and left in a signature feature of the bill giving @entity4 the authority to approve a final deal with @entity8 that the @entity1 earlier implied may have been on the chopping block			1
it now goes to the full @entity10 , where it is could pass with a veto - proof majority of more than 66 lawmakers			1
the @entity1 's top vote counter on monday said lawmakers in the lower chamber would also take up the bill after their colleagues in the @entity10 finished the voting process			1
senators voted 19 - 0 to give the @entity1 some of , but not all of its asks , and left in a signature feature of the bill giving @entity4 the authority to approve a final deal with @entity8 that the @entity1 earlier implied may have been on the chopping block the @entity2 administration was in panic - mode this week , trying to strike a last - minute deal with legislators on both sides of the aisle that would satisfy its concerns with bill , which the @entity1 had said as recently as yesterday that the president would ' absolutely ' veto as written			1
while the legislative branch was in recess administration officials called 130 members of @entity4 to try to persuade them not to act until the political framework that @entity8 agreed a week before firmed up			1
officials ramped up their efforts in classified briefings with lawmakers today and yesterday			0
among the @entity1 's demands were that the @entity56 drop from the bill a requirement to for @entity8 to certify that it has not backed terrorism against @entity60 , cut down a 60 - day ' window for @entity4 to look over a deal and ' clarify ' that it is the president 's ' decision to make ' whether or not to enter into an agreement with @entity8			1
it also said it wants legislators to promise that the bill currently under discussion ' would be the one and only mechanism for codifying precisely what the appropriate congressional oversight is into this matter			0
' ' if we arrived at a place where the bill that is passed by the @entity56 with bipartisan support is essentially is a vote to vote later on congressional sanctions - not the decision about whether or not to enter into the agreement - that would certainly resolve some of the concerns we 've expressed about the authority that is exercised by the @entity85 to conduct foreign policy , ' @entity1 spokesman @entity73 said			1
it is ' critical ' @entity73 said that the legislation that comes out of the @entity10 is bipartisan so that ' there is n't an untoward effort to insert a different provision into some sort of must - pass piece of legislation that could really gum up the works here			1
' ' and if presented with a compromise along the lines that i just laid out here , that would be the kind of compromise the president would be willing to sign , ' he said			2
@entity73 later indicated that the president 's signature would be predicated on senators watering the bill down to just a vote to later vote on congressional sanctions and the inclusion of language that would make clear the proper role of congressional oversight			1
' if the president were writing this piece of legislation it would look substantially different , ' he said , noting that he did n't want to leave reporters with the impression that even in senators were ' willing to agree to this substantial number of changes that i 've laid out here , that we 're gon na be particularly thrilled about the legislation that emerges			2
' i rather think what we would find ourselves with is the kind of compromise that the president would be willing to sign , ' @entity73 explained			2
@entity56 chairman sen. @entity131 , the author of the bill , center , shakes hands with the committee 's ranking member sen. @entity135 after the committee unanimously passed the @entity138 of 2015 he later expressed concern that @entity143 members , if given a vote on the final deal , would be ' willing to flush down the toilet the best bet that we have ' in favor of carrying out air raids on @entity8 , as former @entity60 ambassador @entity149 has suggested			1
' only ' that kind of military action ' can accomplish what is required , ' @entity149 said in a march 25 @entity154 op - ed. ' time is terribly short , but a strike can still succeed			0
' the bill 's lead sponsor , @entity56 chairman @entity131 , during the hearing noted that as a result of 1600 @entity162 's last - ditch lobbying efforts , misinformation was circulating about the current language of the bill			2
' this legislation is exactly the congressional review that we 've been working on since day one , ' he said , and had ' 100 percent of the integrity ' senators on the committee hoped it would			0
lawmakers did agree to take out the terrorism provision and to reduce the review period from 60 days to 30 days but refused to cut it out entirely			0
and sanctions that have been put in place , @entity131 explained ' can not be lifted without the administration bringing to us every detail of the deal			0
' then , he said , ' the clock will start ' on the period of time @entity4 has to debate and decide if it wants to move ahead with a resolution of approval or disapproval - and in the meantime no sanctions can be lifted			2
and that 's not the end of it , he explained , ' @entity4 stays involved			2
' every 90 days , the administration would have to certify that @entity8 is in compliance with the accord , and if there are violations , the executive branch would have 10 days to notify @entity4 so it can reapply sanctions if necessary			1
' so i think this puts @entity4 in its rightful role , ' he said			2
the @entity1 , sensing a legislative defeat was nigh , today said president @entity2 would be willing to meet @entity4 half way and sign legislation codifying its role in processing a nuclear deal with @entity8 if a @entity10 committee axed key portions of the bill during a formal review this afternoon			1
in the end , the committee decided to buck the @entity1 pushing back on the administration 's suggestions that supporters of the @entity10 legislation are warmongers , @entity220 democrat @entity219 , a key force in the bipartisan negotiations around the deal , characterized the claims as ' ridiculous ' and ' offensive ' during the committee meeting , ' i ’m pro-diplomacy ... but i have also been strongly pro the need for congressional approval , ' he posited			1
' i actually think that congressional approval , in this instance under the framework that is now before us , is necessary , helpful and what the @entity60 public demands and deserves			0
'' @entity237 @entity236 , next in line for his party 's top leadership role in the supper chamber , applauded @entity131 and ranking @entity237 senator @entity135 for coming to a bipartisan agreement on how to move forward			0
' ‎ i 'm certainly in favor of what they 've put together , ' he said , throwing his support behind the bill			0
@entity249 democrat @entity248 also lent his name to the legislation this afternoon , signing on as a cosponsor			0
' the @entity60 must do everything in its power to prevent @entity8 from obtaining a nuclear weapon , ' he said in a statement			0
' the framework deal with @entity8 is an important step forward in accomplishing this goal by diplomatic means			2
' but as the body that imposed sanctions on @entity8 , @entity4 has a vitally important role in any process that seeks to modify them , ' he added			1
' the @entity131 - @entity267 bill sets up a reasonable mechanism for @entity4 to have a voice in the process that will help make any agreement with @entity8 as strong as possible			1
' fellow @entity249 senator @entity267 , a namesake of the bill who temporarily stepped aside as ranking member of the committee as he deals with legal troubles , said he wanted to make clear with the committee 's vote it never ' envisioned a wholesale waver ' of nuclear sanctions ' without congressional input			0
' he was responding to @entity8 leaders ' affirmations last week that they would not accept a deal that does not immediately terminate sanctions			2
the @entity2 administration has repeatedly said that it only ever agreed to the phased lifting of restrictions on @entity8 and made that clear during the last round of talks			0
@entity267 , speaking during today 's hearing before the vote , said , ' let 's send a message to @entity296 that sanctions relief is not a given ' and it is ' not a prize for signing on the dotted line			0
' @entity301 sen. @entity300 , an original co-author of the legislation , said in a statement that ' @entity4 should have a say in lifting the economic sanctions which @entity4 created			0
' ' @entity307 of @entity4 needs to listen , speak , and be accountable for what i believe will be one of the most significant foreign policy decisions our nation has faced in decades , ' he said			0
' either with president @entity2 ’s signature – or over his objections – this legislation should immediately be pushed into law			0

sensing a legislative defeat @entity1 said the president would be willing to sign the bill if senators axed key portions of their @entity8 bill
senators voted 19 - 0 to give the @entity1 some of , but not all of its asks , and left in a signature feature giving @entity4 authority over a deal
it now goes to the full @entity10 , where it is could pass with a veto - proof majority - making the president *powerless* to reject it
