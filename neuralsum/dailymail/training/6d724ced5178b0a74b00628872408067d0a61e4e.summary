by @entity0 published : 08:21 est , 1 november 2013 updated : 10:39 est , 1 november 2013 a rogue wallaby spotted bounding around north @entity2 has finally been captured after one final escapade in a children 's playground			1
the animal , known as @entity6 , was seen hopping through the famous graves in @entity8 two weeks ago and snacking in @entity10 's @entity9 the week before			1
but finally , after a major search by @entity13 and @entity15 officials , the wild animal has been rescued as she tried to venture further afield			1
but it does not signal the end of the month - long hunt as witness reports claim another wallaby is still on the loose			1
a confused @entity29 exclaimed down the phone : ' a large wild animal is causing chaos , ' as @entity6 bounced around the 1930s red brick courtyard			1
inspector @entity46 was alerted at 7am , and armed himself with a tennis net to wrap around the wallaby , a notoriously fierce and strong creature			1
calmed down : after a month of bouncing around north @entity2 , @entity6 slowly came to a stand still at last : inspector @entity46 ( left ) had not encountered a wallaby in his nine years with the @entity15 so used a tennis net - a classic @entity54 trick			1
the marsupial was taken to an exotic animal pound near @entity57 although inspector @entity46 was apprehensive about tackling the wallaby , it seems @entity6 had had enough of adventuring			1
by the time the inspector arrived , local children were feeding apples to the gentle creature , who readily tumbled into the inspector 's tennis net and remained calm throughout the journey to her new pound near @entity57			2
inspector @entity46 said : ' i had been told to handle the wallaby by grasping its tail and hold it as high as i could off the ground and as far away from me as possible to stop it finding any purchase for its legs			2
' in fact , when i did grasp it the animal just hung there , relaxed , very much like a cat does when it is scruffed by its mother so i knew it was used to being handled like this			2
' the biggest problem i had was untangling the netting around it when i got it back to the van			0
' he told the @entity91 : ' i 've worked for the @entity15 for nine years and this is my first wallaby			1
' he added that he is still unsure as to how @entity6 managed to get out of the high - walled @entity8 and through the busy streets to @entity27			1
it is the finale in a large - scale bid by @entity13 and @entity15 officers to track down the animal for fear of it being injured on the busy roads			1
unexpected : a wallaby was filmed hopping around @entity8 in north @entity2 two weeks ago adventure : the marsupial hopped around some of the 53,000 graves at the burial site to onlookers ' amazement wallabies are marsupials , like kangaroos but smaller			1
unlike kangaroos who mainly eat grass , they feed on leaves and as a result they have very different teeth			0
they originate from @entity54 but zoo owners brought them to the @entity122 in the late 1800s			0
the most prolific free colony of wallabies in the @entity122 was in @entity125 when a family famously broke free from a private zoo in @entity128			0
they made a home in the @entity132 ' countryside and survived happily in the wild			2
their population peaked in the 1970s			0
although they were reported to have died out in the early 2000s , a photographer spotted the tribe in 2009			0
the colony has cousins living in @entity142 's @entity141 and @entity143 , @entity144			0
there is also a population in @entity147 , an island of @entity149 's @entity148 , created by @entity150 in the 1920s			0
a spokeswoman for the charity said the animal is believed to be one of a pair dumped in @entity157 , and a second wallaby is still thought to be on the loose in north @entity2			1
@entity159 , a documentary maker and zoologist living in the area , spotted the creature during a walk through @entity8 two weeks ago			2
he grabbed his camera to capture the unusual moment as the wallaby bounded over the 53,000 graves			2
he and other concerned @entity13 contacted numerous local zoos when the animals were first spotted - but none of them were missing a wallaby			2
the nearby @entity175 homes wallabies but a spokesperson said that none of their animals had escaped in recent years			0
@entity179 in @entity180 also confirmed that none of their animals had escaped			0
however , the search for the second wallaby is under way , with inspectors hoping to find new homes for them in the near future			1
an @entity15 spokesperson said : ' we 've had reports of more than one wallaby being seen			1
they are herd animals and do n't live on their own , they live in a family			0
' it would 've been strange for one wallaby to be living so healthily and happily without another one , so we 're pretty sure there 's another one to be found			0
' we 're not sure where they came from but we think they could have been dumped by their owner or escaped from some sort of establishment			0
' it is the first time inspector @entity46 has rescued a wallaby before , which is why he spoke to @entity179 and got advice from their kangaroo and wallaby experts			0
not alone : the sighting follows news that another wallaby was seen on @entity215 three weeks ago ' the wallaby is now doing well at its temporary home near @entity57			0
' the charity said populations of red - necked wallabies became established in the wild in @entity122 back in the 1940s			2
however , the @entity223 prohibits the release of them as they are a non-native species , so the @entity8 wallaby will end up in a zoo or somewhere that has a population of the animals .			0
