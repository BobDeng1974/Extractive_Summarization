most holiday snaps have a fascinating tale behind them , but few are better than the story that @entity4 can tell following her trip to @entity6			1
the 21 - year - old @entity8 woman lost her waterproof digital camera in the sea when she visited the @entity12 island with friends two years ago			1
she was heartbroken after losing precious snaps that showed the group relaxing on the beach and frolicking in the ocean , but they have been recovered thanks to a scuba diver			2
@entity4 ( right ) poses for a photo with friends @entity23 ( left ) and @entity24 in @entity6 the photos were returned to @entity26 after the camera was discovered by diver @entity28 @entity4 , a marketing student from @entity29 , lost her camera in two feet of salt water while staying at an all - inclusive resort in @entity33 with friends @entity23 and @entity24 in january 2012			1
she told @entity34 : ‘ my dad originally bought me this shockproof , waterproof camera because i ’m extremely clumsy			0
‘ he said it was " @entity4 proof "			2
i was taking photos with my friends in the ocean maybe three days into the trip and i got hit by a big wave which knocked the camera out of my hand			2
‘ we looked for the camera for about 20 minutes , walking around the area in the water and walking along the beach			0
as soon as it was gone the current must have taken it away , though			0
’ miss @entity4 lost the camera when she was hit by a big wave while holidaying in @entity33 in january 2012 the camera 's memory card contained about 100 photos and video clips from the first few days of the trip @entity4 was 18 at the time and it was one of her first trips abroad with her friends			1
‘ it was disappointing that i still managed to lose the camera , even with all of its safety features			0
we did have other cameras but had lots of video diary footage on my camera that we had been taking since the trip began			0
’ there were about 100 photos and video clips on the memory card , and as luck would have it one of the pictures was of her boarding pass , which had her name printed on it , on the long journey from @entity29 to @entity33			1
that ’s how @entity28 managed to track her down			2
the camera had been damaged but the memory card was still intact when it was found by @entity28 mr @entity28 tracked down @entity26 after finding an image of her boarding pass , which had her name on it @entity4 says she started ' freaking out ' after @entity28 contacted her on @entity91 @entity28 , a professional diver , found the camera - damaged from being pounded by waves - a year ago while he was diving in the ocean off the coast of @entity33 , but the memory card was intact			1
but he did n't get around to finding @entity4 until this month because he only recently gained access to the internet , she said			0
he downloaded the photos and video clips to his computer and scrolled through them , spotting the image of the aeroplane ticket with @entity4 ’s name on it			2
from there , @entity28 was able to track down @entity4 on @entity91 , sending a friend request and a message that had one of the photos attached to prove that it was n’t a bizarre hoax			1
in his @entity91 message , he wrote : ‘ @entity4 , i am from @entity6 , my name is @entity28			1
i know that you was in my country in 2012 because i am diver in @entity33 and i found your camera in the beach , please accept me in your @entity91 friends and i will send you your pictures ! i am sorry my bad @entity123 , have a nice sunday ! ’ [ sic ] @entity4 said : ‘ at first i thought it was just a stranger wanting to be friends on @entity91 but as i actually read [ the message ] i was freaking out			1
‘ i ran downstairs right away to tell my family what happened			0
i think it ’s an amazing story – it really seems like it ’s something out of a movie			0
‘ there are people like @entity28 , doing great things everywhere			0
it means a lot that he took the time to find me and send my pictures back to me			0
