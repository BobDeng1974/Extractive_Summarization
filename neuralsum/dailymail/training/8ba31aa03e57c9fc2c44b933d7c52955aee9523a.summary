the pioneering women and men behind the invention of the pill risked being arrested , a new book reveals			2
the @entity5 , which will be released on monday , delves into the lives of the four ' crusaders ' who brought the pill to fruition - feminist @entity10 , scientist @entity12 , @entity14 @entity13 and philanthropist @entity15 , who funded most of the research			1
it explains how in the @entity19 's initial stages in the 1950s , before its approval , @entity12 and @entity13 tested it on 50 unknowing patients in @entity21 under the guise of a fertility study , so as not to interfere with the state 's anti-birth control laws			1
but the ethically ambiguous way they made this discovery is undeniably a topic of interest			0
' you can really have a wonderful ethical discussion and debate about whether it was worth it , whether they were doing things that were beyond the bounds , ' author @entity29 told @entity48			0
' the laws and the ethics of science were very different in the 1950s than they are today - you did n't have to give informed consent , you did n't have to have anybody sign forms giving away their rights , telling them about what these experiments are for			1
' so in a way , we do have women being treated like lab animals so that we may find a form of birth control that frees them			2
there 's a great irony there			2
' the ' pioneers ' were also not afraid to cut corners when it came to having the @entity19 approved and then marketed to women , coming up with a genius way of masking its true purpose			1
' they decide , " we 're not going to ask the @entity75 to approve it as birth control because that will raise a whole bunch of other issues			2
... let 's just ask them to approve it for menstrual disorders , " ' explains mr @entity29			1
so , in 1957 , the @entity19 was sold as @entity84 - an @entity75 - approved treatment of menstrual disorders , with a label on the packaging that read : ' warning : this pill will likely prevent pregnancy '			1
' and it 's the greatest advertisement they could ever have , ' says mr @entity29 , ' because this is what women want			2
' the book chronicles the history of the birth control pill , from the idea 's inception and its controversial inventors to the moment it hit shelves and ignited a sexual revolution			1
it explains how the group banded together in the @entity108 to create a pill that would finally grant women sexual freedom			0
teamwork : in the 1950s , @entity113 founder @entity10 ( left ) and scientist @entity12 ( right ) collaborated to create a pill that could grant women sexual liberation when @entity15 , a very wealthy early suffragist , and @entity10 , who founded @entity113 in the @entity119 , first met @entity12 in the early fifties , selling contraception was still illegal in many states			1
so they had to be careful not to attract too much attention when their research into a contraceptive pill went underway			0
' they absolutely could 've been imprisoned for some of the work they were doing , ' mr @entity29 told @entity48			0
@entity12 had recently been fired from his job as assistant professor at @entity132 for his experimentation with in - vitro fertilization , and he was something of an outcast in the science world			1
after the women approached him about inventing a ' miracle drug ' that could stop ovulation , he became obsessed with the idea			0
the science was there , but research and experimentation would be expensive ; that 's where @entity15 came in			0
contributions : catholic physician @entity13 ( left ) carried out experiments , and philanthropist @entity15 ( right ) provided almost all the funds needed for research a prominent member of the @entity153 , @entity15 had been campaigning for women 's rights - including to her own body			1
according to @entity157 , at her very first meeting with @entity12 , she wrote him a check for $ 40,000 - the first of many more to come			2
indeed , with the inheritance she earned from her husband 's death , @entity15 funded nearly every dollar that went into making the @entity19 a reality			1
the fourth person credited with the ' birth of the pill ' in the book is @entity13 - a pioneer in sperm freezing and the only @entity172 physician to sign a petition to legalize birth control in 1931			1
uncovered : the book reveals how the @entity19 was tested on 50 unknowing patients in @entity21 under the guise of a fertility study , so as not to interfere with the state 's anti-birth control laws once the pill was approved , @entity13 fought long and hard to convince the @entity172 community to accept it			1
in 1988 the @entity182 officially condemned the @entity19 in the encyclical @entity183 , prompting @entity13 to stop attending mass for the first time in his life			1
mr @entity29 reveals how all four had to disguise the true purpose of their research and experimentation so as to keep naysayers away , which was the only way to make it a reality			0
' these guys are like guerrilla warriors - they 're always having to figure out ways to do this thing that will attract the least attention , ' he explains			0
' they can never really say they 're testing birth control			0
' mr @entity29 told @entity48 that he became inspired to write about this topic after he heard a rabbi say in his sermon that the @entity19 was the most important invention to come out of the 20th century			2
skeptical at first , he soon realized it ' had changed more than just science , more than just medicine			0
it had changed human dynamics			0
it had changed the way men and women get along in the world			0
' he continued : ' it changed reproduction , obviously , but it also created all kinds of opportunities for women that were n't there before , it had spread democracy			0

in the 1950s , before the @entity19 was approved , doctors @entity12 and @entity13 tested it on 50 patients in @entity21 under the guise of a fertility study , so as not to interfere with the state 's anti-birth control laws
and when it was first sold in 1957 , it was marketed as a treatment of menstrual disorders , with a label that read : ' warning : this pill will likely prevent pregnancy '
