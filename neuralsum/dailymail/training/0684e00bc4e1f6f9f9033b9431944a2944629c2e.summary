by @entity0 published : 06:59 est , 8 june 2013 updated : 05:27 est , 11 june 2013 the world ’s last flying @entity1 will be able to stay in the skies for the public to enjoy after strenuous efforts by the plane 's supporters			1
enthusiastic fundraising means that the plane 's wings can be strengthened in a high - precision operation to keep it airworthy until the end of this year , but more contributions will be needed to keeping it going into 2015			1
famed for their role in the @entity19 of 1982 , it was feared the last of the iconic planes would have to be grounded but charity @entity21 was determined not to let that happen			1
still flying : the last airworthy @entity23 soaring over @entity24 iconic : @entity1 bombers were due to be scrapped before the @entity19 in 1982 but this one is still capable of flying @entity1 bombers were flown in the crucial attack on @entity29 ’s airstrip on may 1 in 1982 in a marathon 8,000 - mile round trip			1
the raid , the longest bombing mission in history at the time , showed @entity37 ’s military dictator @entity36 that @entity38 was serious about retaking the @entity39			0
flight lieutenant @entity40 captained that bomber and now is chief pilot of the last flying @entity1			1
he recalled : ' we were charged with bombing a 40 - foot wide target half a world away in the dark with such accuracy that the runway would be destroyed			2
there was no margin of error in the plan			0
' ' @entity53 were going to war for the first time in their history – just months before they had been due for scrapping or museums			0
' heritage : a @entity1 bomber making an approach to land at @entity61 in 1982 during the @entity19 restoration : in 2007 , flying the first time in 14 years after it was grounded in 1993 long history : the bomber first flew in 1960 but is preparing for two more years of flying at its hangar near @entity68 , @entity69 vulcans were long - range bombers first designed and built for the @entity72			1
this particular plane first flew in 1960 and was the @entity74 ’s last airworthy @entity1 until it was retired in 1993			1
it was grounded from then until october 2007			2
2013 was meant to be the last year it flew after its restoration project , but the plane keeps getting the support it needs to carry on flying			0
it is currently kept at a hangar in @entity83 @entity83			0
the task of making the plane airworthy was made particularly difficult for heritage aircraft specialists at @entity87 , who also support the @entity38 ’s last flying @entity89 , because none of the original manufacturing tools and key drawings survive			0
modifications : to allow the @entity1 two more flying years requires a very precise operation by rare aircraft specialists to strength the wings following further testing , it will be ready to take off for another season of displays across the country			2
' if everything goes to plan , we should be able to release sufficient additional flying hours for @entity23 to complete full display seasons in both 2014 and 2015 , ' said @entity108 chief executive , dr @entity107			2
although the technology exists for the plane to be able to fly until 2015 , the charity still needs to raise £ 400,000 by october so that it can fly into 2014 and 2015			0
privately maintained by a team of professional ex-raf technicians , the aircraft casts more than £ 2 million a year to keep flying			0
the @entity23 is now enjoyed by around three million visitors every year			1
the team behind @entity23 needs to find £ 400,000 of donations to carry out the modifications to keep it flying			2

it was feared the @entity23 would be grounded at the end of the year
fundraising by enthusiasts mean that public will still get to see it fly
@entity1 bombers were *tactically* vital in the 1982 @entity19
they were long - range bombers designed and built during the @entity72
