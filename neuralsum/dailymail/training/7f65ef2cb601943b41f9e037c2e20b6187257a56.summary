@entity0 will have to impose spending cuts ‘ on a colossal scale ’ to meet his targets , a leading think - tank warned yesterday			1
the independent @entity5 said the chancellor would have to slash welfare or put up taxes by £ 21billion just to keep cuts down to the same level as @entity11 has seen in the past five years			1
without this , £ 55billion in cuts will be needed after next may ’s election if the @entity15 win , compared with the £ 35billion made since the @entity16 came to power in 2010			2
public spending as a share of the entire economy will fall to just 35.2 per cent by 2018 - 19 , according to the @entity22 's forecasts of spending cuts chancellor @entity0 admitted difficult decisions lie ahead in order to get @entity11 ' out of the red and into the black ' the respected think - tank suggested cuts on this scale would mean a ‘ fundamental re-imagining of the role of the state ’			1
it urged mr @entity0 to spell out before the election what the cuts would mean for public services such as transport , policing and defence			1
@entity5 director @entity43 said : ‘ it is surely incumbent upon anyone set on taking the size of the state to its smallest in many generations to tell us what that means			2
' how will these cuts be implemented ? what will local government , the defence force , the transport system look like in this world ? spending by government departments will fall to just 12 per cent of gdp			1
if health , schools and foreign aid are protected , other areas will be severely squeezed plans to grant the taxman new powers to ‘ name and shame ’ serial tax dodgers could unfairly target the innocent , experts warned last night			2
tax specialists and campaigners fear the proposals allowing @entity72 to publicly identify suspected serial tax avoiders will backfire			2
many legitimate tax schemes are set up to help burgeoning industries take off , and attract individuals keen to legally reduce their tax bill			2
but there are fears those who take advantage of such schemes could now be unfairly named as serial avoiders			2
critics argue the change could name innocent individuals given bad tax advice , wrongly implicate hard - working entrepreneurs , and turn households into victims of mistaken identity			1
@entity92 , of accountants @entity93 , said : ‘ i ’m all for people paying the right amount of tax			2
but any proposed scheme to collect more tax must target the correct people , not those engaged in legitimate practices			2
’ campaigners ’ concerns focus on small print buried in the chancellor ’s @entity106 , which proposed publishing the names of those it believes are ‘ repeat users of known avoidance schemes ’			0
these schemes are often fiendishly complicated and set up by financial specialists to attract funding to target industries			0
backers range from ordinary businessmen to well - off investors and celebrities			1
@entity122 , spokesman for the @entity121 , said : ‘ @entity72 regularly get things wrong , so there ’s a risk individuals could be named and shamed without having done anything wrong			0
’ @entity72 said the proposals were aimed at a hard core of tax avoiders with an average income of £ 260,000 who have tried to avoid paying more than £ 10million in tax			0
‘ one thing is for sure			0
if we move in anything like this direction , whilst continuing to protect health and pensions , the role and shape of the state will have changed beyond all recognition			0
’ figures released yesterday also suggest that @entity145 ’s plan to cut the deficit more slowly if it wins the election would leave @entity148 free to borrow about £ 25billion more than the @entity149 to fund a spending splurge – adding to @entity11 ’s mountain of debt			1
mr @entity0 has already announced plans for a further £ 12billion of cuts in welfare after the election			0
but the @entity5 said this would have to almost double to £ 21billion to maintain the current pace of cuts to other areas of spending			1
the scale of the challenge is made harder by the government ’s decision to protect – or ring - fence – spending on health , schools and foreign aid , meaning that cuts in other areas of public spending will have to be far deeper			1
budgets for unprotected departments such as defence , transport and the @entity175 are on course to fall by an average of almost a third unless the government cuts welfare more deeply or raises taxes			1
by 2020 spending on health and the state pension will account for almost a third of all government spending – 32 per cent , up from 14 per cent when the welfare state was founded after the @entity188			1
the @entity5 said that despite a slew of announcements on new roads and flood defences there was ‘ no spending dividend on the horizon ’			1
mr @entity43 said : ‘ on these plans , whichever way you look at it , we are considerably less than halfway through the cuts			0
’ the figures also underline the difficulty the @entity149 will face in finding the £ 7billion needed to pay for big increases in the personal tax allowance and the 40p income tax threshold after the election			0
mr @entity0 defended his proposals , insisting voters faced a choice between the ‘ course to prosperity ’ set out in the @entity106 or a return to the chaos seen under @entity145			0
in june 2010 , the @entity214 predicted that in 2014 - 15 borrowing would fall to just £ 37billion , but it has remained high at around £ 100billion and is not expected to return a surplus until 2018 - 19 @entity0 yesterday hit out at the @entity218 's ' hyperbolic ' coverage of spending cuts , accusing the broadcaster of predicting the world would fall in			1
the chancellor clashed with radio 4 today programme host @entity223 about questions on the state of the country 's finances			0
mr @entity0 said : ' when i woke up this morning and turned on the today programme i felt like i was listening to a rewind of a tape from 2010			0
you had @entity218 correspondents saying @entity11 is returning to a sort of @entity237 world of @entity238			1
' @entity237 's bleak book chronicled poverty , hunger and social injustice in the north of @entity244 in the 1930s			0
mr @entity0 repeatedly hit back at @entity223 ' ' nonsense ' questioning , adding : ' i would have thought the @entity218 would have learned from the last four years that its totally hyperbolic coverage of spending cuts has not been matched by what has actually happened			1
' i had all that when you interviewed me four years , and has the world fallen in ? no it has n't			1
the @entity11 economy is growing and the deficit is half what it was when i was doing those interviews			1
' last month work and pensions secretary @entity258 accused the @entity218 of being ' utterly negative ' about the government 's flagship welfare reforms , and challenged claims by today present @entity262 that it had been ' dogged ' by problems			0
‘ i ’ve got a plan to reduce the deficit			0
i ’m not going faster than that plan , i ’m not going slower than that plan , ’ he said			0
‘ we have demonstrated in specific ways over the past four years that we can reduce the cost of public services while actually improving the quality			1
’ he has already set out plans for £ 11.5billion of additional cuts for 2015/6			0
the @entity15 have said a further £ 25billion will be needed in the following two years to clear the budget deficit			1
however , the @entity5 says the true level of cuts needed for that period is nearer £ 30billion			0
it said recent progress on reducing the deficit had been ‘ disappointing ’ , with the gap between spending and income falling by only £ 6billion in the past year to £ 91.3billion			2
the think - tank also raised concerns about the sharp fall in tax revenues			1
mr @entity43 said that , despite the recovery , the @entity22 had produced a ‘ really substantial downgrade ’ of £ 8billion in expected tax revenues this year			0
the shortfall is set to rise to £ 21billion by 2017/18 , making it even more difficult for mr @entity0 to pay down the national debt			0
he said on wednesday he wants a budget surplus of £ 23billion by 2019/20 , which it is estimated would require a further £ 14billion of cuts			0
‘ this lack of buoyancy in tax revenues , associated with poor earnings growth , looks like being a continued cause for concern , ’ said mr @entity43			0
in 2010 @entity0 remained confident that borrowing would fall sharply , but in 2011 and 2012 a deterioration in the economic picture meant the prospect of balancing the books slipped further into the future			2

another five years of pain to get @entity11 back into the black by 2019
one in five public sector jobs to be axed over the next five years
total spending to fall to just 35 **%** of @entity316 , down from 45 **%** in 2009 - 10
