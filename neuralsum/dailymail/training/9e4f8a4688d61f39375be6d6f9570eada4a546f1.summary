by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 10:13 est , 13 november 2013 @entity3 : 15:24 est , 13 november 2013 @entity6 always looks startled because he has ‘ got big eyes ’ which affects whether voters see him as prime minister , @entity5 heavyweight @entity4 has claimed			1
the former minister - who quit as mr @entity6 ’s election strategist this summer - also said the @entity5 leader got it ‘ so wrong ’ over the @entity17 vote - rigging scandal and struggled to make headlines because he is too clever			1
recent opinion polls show @entity5 extending its lead over the @entity20 , but more voters think @entity22 would make a better leader for @entity24			2
however mr @entity4 makes clear that after a faltering start he now believes mr @entity6 ' will be a good prime minister '			1
miracle : @entity4 ( left ) said @entity6 had been ' learning on the job ' and his main achievement was stopping the @entity5 tearing itself apart mr @entity6 has repeatedly been likened to plastercine character @entity29 , of @entity29 and @entity29 fame			1
in recent weeks he has made headlines with his promise to freeze energy bills and attacking the government over the cost of living			0
but a new @entity38 poll this week showed only 27 per cent of people think he would make the best prime minister , including only 64 per cent of people who backed @entity5 in 2010			2
a separate @entity43 survey found just four per cent think he is a ' natural leader ' - the same as @entity45			0
now mr @entity4 has suggested the way mr @entity6 looks means voters might struggle to imagine him running the country			1
mr @entity4 was being interviewed by comedian @entity49 as part of the live theatre comedy show @entity52 , which is recorded as a podcast			2
appearing on stage mr @entity4 admitted that the @entity5 leader often looks startled even when challenging mr @entity22 in the @entity56			1
‘ well he has got big eyes			0
that does n’t help him , ’ mr @entity4 said			2
he went on to suggest that mr @entity6 ’s greatest achievement so far was preventing @entity5 tearing itself apart , but warned the first few years of his leadership were wasted by being too ‘ clever ’			2
mr @entity4 said : ‘ did the right @entity6 win ? yes , i think the most important challenge for the leader that won was to unify the party and i think @entity6 was the person who could most do that			1
’ asked if he meant mr @entity6 uniting the party behind or against him , mr @entity4 replied : ‘ that ’s a good question			1
’ he added : ‘ the truth is i think it is a miracle he has held it all together			0
’ mr @entity4 , who backed @entity69 for @entity5 leader , said that when mr @entity6 won in 2010 ‘ i was n’t sure where he would go ’			1
he added : ‘ he was a young leader who was n’t supposed to win			0
there were a lot of question marks over his leadership			0
he has done a lot of learning on the job			2
’ praise : mr @entity4 said that at a recent @entity78 , mr @entity6 looked like a leader while @entity22 appeared ' old and tired ' @entity4 was offered a ' staggering ' amount of money to take part in celebrity big brother - but turned it down			1
taking questions during the @entity86 comedy show , he said he was unsure if he wanted to be a minister again			0
an audience member suggested he sign up for @entity89			0
mr @entity4 replied : ' i was offered a staggering amount of money from someone who said i should be on celebrity big brother			2
' i think i would be terrible at all that stuff			0
' another audience member said the @entity5 heavyweight would be better suited to @entity98			0
mr @entity4 said that at a recent @entity78 mr @entity6 now looked like a ‘ prime minister in waiting and @entity22 looked old and tired and you would n’t have said that a year ago			1
’ ‘ yes , i think he will be a good prime minister			0
’ he said mr @entity6 had a ‘ particular problem ’ facing a coalition , because the @entity20 and @entity102 were more interesting and he is ‘ kind of third on the newslists ’			0
but he said mr @entity6 ’s reputation as a policy wonk held @entity5 back ‘ if i am being honest because he is so bright and clever and he is such a thinker , he has been very good on the strategic stuff but learning to be in opposition was a bit of a chore for us			1
’ he said too many of the @entity5 leadership had only ever been in government and struggled to make an impression in opposition			0
‘ for them to act as an opposition and seize issues and make them theirs was quite difficult for us in the early years			0
’ mr @entity4 also turned his fire on the @entity5 leader over his handling of allegations of vote - rigging in @entity17			1
in the summer he quit as election strategist over claims that he was involved in claims the @entity134 union signed up people to the @entity5 without their knowledge in order to influence candidate selection in @entity17			0
mr @entity6 reported mr @entity140 ’s office manager @entity139 to the police and has since refused to reopen the party inquiry , despite claims witnesses were pressured into changing their stories			2
mr @entity4 said : ‘ it 's amazing how my own leader can be so wrong			1
‘ it 's hard for me to say this , but @entity6 just got it wrong on @entity17			1
‘ he was given information , or a report , that was inaccurate and omitted some key facts , and took judgements that really harmed the individuals involved in a grotesque way			0
‘ i suspect privately he is a little bit embarrassed about it			0
’ mr @entity4 said he did not know if he would want to be a minister again – or if mr @entity6 would want him			1
‘ if @entity5 won the next election , do i want to be a minister , does @entity6 want me to be a minister ? i honestly do n’t know			2
