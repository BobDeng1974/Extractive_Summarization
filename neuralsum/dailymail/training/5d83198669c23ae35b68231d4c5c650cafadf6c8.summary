@entity6 has transformed the lounge at her @entity16 farm into a stable for her latest pony , @entity21 the mother - of - four now plans to open a sanctuary to save more ponies from the abattoir @entity21 , pictured with @entity6 , is a former top riding school pony , which went under the hammer for just £ 150 @entity6 , who runs a kennel , is now planning to start a horse sanctuary with the help of @entity34 , which blew the whistle on the mistreatment at @entity14 last month			1
@entity6 first saved a @entity37 at @entity38 near @entity39 for £ 200			1
she said : ' my husband @entity42 could n't believe his eyes when i turned up with my first horse , @entity45			2
i 'd set out to @entity8 to do the weekly shop but then suddenly remembered it was @entity47 where the horses go under the hammer for next to nothing			1
' i turned around and headed straight there , saw maid on @entity52 - the area where the meat horses wait outside in the car park for auction - and went in and haggled for her with a dealer against the abattoir man			1
' a friend at the sale loaned me her horse box and i took her home			2
when my husband @entity42 saw what i 'd done he just said i was crazy			2
' last wednesday , @entity6 went back to @entity38 with £ 200 in her pocket			1
she expected to buy one or two ponies - and came back with eight ponies			1
they included @entity21 , a former top riding school pony with a sackful of rosettes for wins over her 12 - year life			1
another was a pregnant foal with another foal alongside her			2
@entity6 , pictured , who runs a kennel , had the ponies checked over by a vet - and they were all given a clean bill of health @entity6 , pictured with @entity21 , is setting up the sanctuary with the help of @entity34 , which blew the whistle on the mistreatment at @entity14 ' i could n't just stand by and watch them sold and carted off to @entity14 to be slaughtered for the meat market			1
i did n't have enough cash but my son @entity92 who was with me dashed to the cash point and drew out what he could			2
' i paid for one by credit card , and there was a friend there who said she would buy a horse if i looked after it			0
i got money off another friend there and a lady who came forward and said she 'd have one			0
somehow i got enough together for the lot			0
' i outbid the abattoir man			0
i was determined they were n't going through those gates at the abattoir			0
he was n't happy , but i guess he 'll have his day another time in another place			0
' the horse lover said she had the horses checked over by a vet when she got them home			1
luckily , they were all given a clean bill of health			0
she now plans to set up a charity which will own the horses and loan them to carers who have been fully vetted			1
' i ca n't look after them all on just two to three acres but this way we can monitor the horses at their new homes and because the charity owns them we can make sure they are well kept			1
only trusted keepers will be allowed to have them			0
the idea is to set up lifetime homes for them			1
' now , we 're desperately trying to re-home them through our @entity134 page			0
' ' it 's already growing through word of mouth with well wishers arriving with feed and horse blankets and odd bits of kit			0
but the loose box i 've got is too small for eight so @entity144 has to bed down in the lounge until we sort out more space			2
i do n't mind , it 's worth it just to see her happy			0
' we 're determined the cruelty and the horse meat trade has to stop , i wo n't rest until @entity14 and places like it are closed down for good			1
' it is such a shame these horses are cast off like this			2
there was n't really a bad one among them			0
' yes they were scruffy , but with a bit of @entity162 , good food and water they can be brought back			0
to think by now , they would all be killed and into the food process is appalling			0
' it 's taken over my whole life , but i will not rest while these lovely animals face a dreadful fate			0
through the internet , and @entity134 , we can reach out to those who care			0
