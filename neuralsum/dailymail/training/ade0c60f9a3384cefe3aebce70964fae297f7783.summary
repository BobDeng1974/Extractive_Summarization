a federal judge has thrown out a lawsuit brought by an @entity3 sheriff that sought to halt president @entity6 's plan to spare nearly 5 million people from deportation			1
@entity10 district judge @entity9 , herself nominated to the federal bench by @entity6 in 2010 , said @entity13 sheriff @entity12 had legal standing to challenge the immigration program the president announced last month			1
she suggested the topic is better left for @entity18 and the @entity6 administration to sort out			2
the case ' raises important questions regarding the impact of illegal immigration on this nation , but the questions amount to generalized grievances which are not proper for the judiciary to address , ' @entity9 wrote			0
the @entity28 held up the decision on wednesday as confirmation that the president 's executive actions are on the up and up			1
' the @entity56 and @entity18 have made clear that federal officials can set priorities in enforcing our immigration laws , and the actions announced by the president are consistent with those taken by administrations of both parties for the last half century			1
' in the first courtroom battle over @entity6 's plan , @entity12 's lawyer , @entity66 , told reporters on monday that the president violated the @entity71 by doing an end - run around @entity73 , there are ' serious issues of constitutionality involved ' in the president 's actions			1
' it 's not policy , he 's creating law and he can not do that under the @entity71 , ' @entity66 said in remarks outside the courtroom			0
he argued that the program would let more illegal immigrants enter the country and commit crimes , burdening law enforcement – @entity12 's area of concern			1
' it 's not policy , he 's creating law and he can not do that under the @entity71 , ' @entity66 said of @entity6			1
@entity12 has often clashed with the federal government over the enforcement of immigration laws and he has filed suit to stop new policies announced by @entity6			1
he claims that more than 35 percent of immigrants living in @entity13 illegally who wound up in his jails this year were repeat offenders , buttressing his view that federal officials have done a poor job of deporting criminals			0
but @entity49 lawyer @entity109 said @entity12 's lawsuit seemed to be raising a ' political dispute ' rather than a legal claim the court could address			1
the @entity6 administration had called the case ' speculative and unsubstantiated ' and had urged the court to dismiss it			0
@entity9 at times seemed exasperated with @entity66 , a longtime conservative activist who has filed hundreds of lawsuits against the federal government , including challenges to @entity6 's @entity10 citizenship , during his presentation			1
when @entity66 said his client has been threatened because of his tough views on @entity6 's immigration policy , @entity9 responded : ' that just does n't cut it for me			2
' @entity9 also said it did not appear that @entity12 could show a ' concrete ' injury he has suffered from the new policy , especially since it will take months before the bulk of it actually goes into effect			0
' if @entity18 does n't like it , does n't @entity18 have the power to step in ? ' she asked			2
judge @entity9 , nominated by @entity6 , heard the case focused on claims that the president has violated the @entity71 by doing an end run around @entity18 and that drastic changes in immigration programs should be stopped @entity6 's plan , derided by conservatives as an ' amnesty ' for millions of lawbreakers , marks the most sweeping change to the nation 's immigration policies in nearly three decades and set off a fierce fight on @entity152			1
the changes include work permits and three - year deportation stays for more than 4 million immigrants here illegally			0
it mostly applies to those who have been in the country more than five years and have children who are @entity10 citizens or legal permanent residents			0
under the program , the @entity161 would prioritize the removal of immigrants who present threats to national security , public safety or border security			0
@entity161 officials could deport someone if an @entity172 field office director determined that removing the person would serve an important federal interest			0
the @entity28 has insisted that @entity6 is acting under proper legal authority to enforce the nation 's immigration laws			2
@entity66 of the conservative nonprofit @entity178 is representing the @entity13 , @entity3 sheriff 's office in the lawsuit , and filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to stop @entity6 from granting legal status to approximately 4.7 illegal aliens in the @entity10 @entity12 has suffered a series of stinging political defeats in his quest to slow the flow of illegal immigrants into his @entity3 county			1
just last week he agreed to give up a major part of his efforts that won him popularity among voters but gradually were dismantled by the @entity6 administration and the courts			0
@entity12 's office said dec. 17 that it would disband a controversial squad that has raided businesses to arrest more than 700 immigrants who were charged with using fake or stolen ids to get jobs			2
after complaints from the @entity204 and other groups that charged he was engaging in racial profiling – most illegal immigrants in @entity3 are @entity209 – his office was found to have done so at least in some traffic stops			2
as a result the federal government had stripped him of special federal immigration powers and investigated him for alleged civil rights violations			0
@entity12 , however , remains popular in @entity3 , where voters have elected him six times			2
he is best known for operating a series of outdoor ' tent city ' jails where male inmates are limited to wearing pink underwear and those over age 18 are required to register for the @entity226 military draft			0
in 2007 he launched an in - house jail radio station that broadcasts patriotic songs , @entity230 tunes , educational shows and classical music 20 hours each week .			0

@entity10 's ' toughest sheriff ' wanted to force @entity235 to stop the flow of illegal - immigrant criminals into his *southern* @entity3 county
sheriff @entity12 went to court to stop the president 's executive actions that will *guarantee* millions of immigrants a free pass from deportation
a federal judge said the sheriff has no ' standing ' to sue because his law enforcement agency has n't yet seen the effects of the new policy
the judge , @entity254 , was appointed by @entity6 in 2010
lawsuit hoped to prove the @entity28 did an end - run around @entity18 and *seized* *lawmaking* power that belongs to federal *legislators*
