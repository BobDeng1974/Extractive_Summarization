nobody ever laughed at @entity1			1
racist abuse is n’t funny			0
biting an opponent is n’t funny			0
diving and cheating is n’t terribly amusing either			0
so quite what @entity1 meant when he suggested ‘ people in @entity7 laughed ’ about his ‘ attitude over the last few years ’ is anybody ’s guess			1
all that can be said is that the @entity13 striker was utterly humourless when he spoke to the assembled @entity15 media in a corner of the post-match interview area here on thursday			1
video : scroll down to watch @entity1 's emotional dressing room message to wife and kids revenge mission : @entity1 has hit back at his critics after downing @entity7 payback time : @entity1 felt no remorse about sinking his adopted home he was cold , impassive			1
nothing like the man we had just seen kiss his physiotherapist on the head before blubbing in the dug - out			0
no , after a shower and an encounter with doping control this was now payback time			0
this was a chance to settle a score by delivering a not - so - polite ‘ up yours ’ to his adopted home			0
which was a pity given how prepared we @entity15 were to acknowledge his brilliance			0
to acknowledge the sheer force of will he displayed in almost singlehandedly destroying @entity7 ’s hapless defence			1
we knew he was a world - class talent			0
it was why he was crowned the best player in the country by both his peers and the @entity55			0
but to perform at that level on thursday only weeks after he was being pushed around in a wheelchair was incredible			0
tribute : @entity1 celebrated his opening goal with the @entity13 physio who helped get him fit after surgery it was an achievement that commanded our respect			1
sadly that respect does not seem to go both ways and this is not about the @entity15 media — which is irrelevant — but about his colleagues at @entity71 , the people of @entity73 and beyond			1
the people who were prepared to forgive and forget and recognise that here was someone who addressed his issues and became a better player , and a better man , as a result			0
now , however , you have to question just how genuine he was			0
in fact , you start to question a number of things he has said in recent months and wonder whether the real @entity1 has just resurfaced again			1
the same @entity1 we saw agitating for a move away from @entity73 last year			1
who even resorted to questioning the honesty and integrity of his manager , @entity92			0
only last month he said he was committed to remaining with @entity73			1
that he signed his new contract last december because he was now totally committed to the @entity71 cause			1
deft touch : @entity1 headed past @entity96 to set @entity13 on their way my best manager @entity100			1
far from perfect but made three consecutive quarter - finals and masterminded big wins against top opposition			0
my favourite @entity105 5 - 1 win in @entity107 is the most exciting match i ’ve witnessed covering @entity7			1
there have been more gifted players , but he was a top class centre half — something we ’re missing			0
‘ i signed the contract because i love it here , ’ he said			2
‘ if you ’re not happy here you do n’t sign any contract			2
’ before @entity73 ’s players went their separate ways for the summer he also told them he was going nowhere			0
@entity121 was certainly of the view that @entity1 would give @entity73 at least one more season			2
more worrying for @entity73 is the apparent disregard for the reception he is sure to receive in the @entity126 after making his remarks			0
the suspicion must be that he does not fear the inevitable hostility because he does not intend to return to @entity7			2
on friday the @entity131 newspapers were dominated by speculation regarding @entity1			1
the hierarchy at @entity134 were thought to have been encouraged by @entity1 ’s post-match comments , sensing there might now be a chance to pounce			1
defying the odds : @entity1 had surgery on a knee injury just a month ago in @entity143 it is claimed that a deal is all but done			1
whether the @entity145 have the financial clout to make such a move remains to be seen			0
but @entity148 , the @entity143 sports daily , reported that the club had not only identified @entity1 as their top target but said talks are very serious			1
they wrote of an € 85million release clause in @entity1 ’s contract that would be lowered by € 20 million should @entity134 or @entity143 make a bid			1
and they salivated over the prospect of @entity1 partnering @entity159 and @entity160 in the most formidable attack in @entity162			2
at the same time , they said @entity164 might move to @entity73			0
the report also highlighted the added attraction for @entity1 of having the in - laws round the corner			2
apparently his wife ’s family live in @entity171 , a @entity143 suburb where the likes of @entity159 currently reside			2
‘ i want to see what they think now , ’ was how @entity1 signed off his message to those he considers his detractors			2
presumably from a safer vantage point , somewhere in @entity131 .			2
