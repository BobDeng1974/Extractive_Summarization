the @entity0 agreed friday to hear a new challenge to president @entity3 's health care law that would threaten federal subsidies that help millions of low - and middle - income people afford their health insurance premiums			1
the justices said they will review a unanimous federal appeals court ruling that upheld @entity10 regulations that allow health - insurance tax credits under the @entity12 for consumers in all 50 states , regardless of whether they signed up through their state exchanges or through the federal healthcare site			1
opponents argue that federal subsidies are illegal because of the way health care reform legislation was worded			1
the bill specifically notes that subsidies are available ' through an exchange established by the state ' - not by the federal government			1
the @entity0 agreed friday to hear a new challenge to the law that seeks to invalidate federal subsidies @entity37 press secretary @entity36 said the congressional intent behind the law is for eligible customers regardless of where they live to receive assistance from the government to subsidize the purchase of health care			1
he promised a vigorous defense before the high court			2
' we continue to have high confidence in the legal argument , both from a legal perspective and a common - sense perspective			2
this is a law that is working , that 's why you 'll see a vigorous defense here , ' @entity36 told reporters on friday			0
the long - running political and legal campaign to overturn or limit the 2010 health overhaul will be making its second appearance at the @entity0			2
the justices upheld the heart of the law in a 5 - 4 decision in 2012 in which chief justice @entity67 provided the decisive vote			0
in the appeal accepted friday , opponents of the subsidies argued that the court should resolve the issue now because it involves billions of dollars in public money			2
' today ’s grant of cert by the @entity0 is excellent news , regardless of which side of the issue you ’re on , ' @entity75 , general counsel for the @entity76 , a group funding the @entity12 challenge , said today in a statement			0
' the need for a quick and final resolution of this question is undeniable			0
' this " subsidies - for - everyone " rule affects nearly every person across the country — health insurance policyholders , workers and employers , taxpayers , and state and local governments , ' he added			1
the court rarely steps into a case when there is no disagreement among federal appellate courts , unless a law or regulation has been ruled invalid			2
but at least four justices , needed to grant review , apparently agreed with the challengers that the issue is important enough to decide now			0
supporters of the health care law were flabbergasted and accused the court of verging into politics			1
the news came a week ahead of the second open enrollment season for subsidized private health insurance under the law			2
' all of the general guidelines that the court traditionally uses in determining whether it should schedule an appeal are totally absent in this case , ' said @entity123 , executive director of @entity124 , an advocacy group that supported @entity3 's health overhaul from its inception			0
@entity123 called the court 's action ' an unusual political act			0
' the legal challenge to the subsidies is ' the most serious existential threat ' facing the @entity12 , added @entity123			2
@entity133 , 30 , holds her 10 - month - old son , @entity134 , as she waits in line at a health insurance enrollment event in @entity137 , @entity138 , in march			2
because @entity138 has its own @entity12 exchange , the states residents are not immediately in danger of losing government subsides if the new @entity12 case succeeds the health care law provides taxpayer - subsidized private health insurance for people who do n't have access to coverage on the job			1
more than 4 out of 5 of the roughly 7 million people currently enrolled are getting help , which is keyed to household income and the cost of a benchmark plan			0
when the court upheld the law in 2012 , it still made a major change to @entity3 's signature legislation by ruling that its @entity162 expansion for low - income people was optional for states			1
so far 27 states and the @entity30 have accepted it			0
this week 's @entity168 election success makes it unlikely that the remaining 23 states will move any time soon			0
the subsidies issue is being fought in several courts			0
in july , the @entity174 , @entity175 - based appeals court upheld @entity10 regulations that allow health - insurance tax credits under the law for consumers in all 50 states			1
on that same july day , a panel of appellate judges in the @entity30 , sided with the challengers in striking down the @entity10 regulations			0
the @entity30 court held that under the law , financial aid can be provided only in states that have set up their own insurance markets , known as exchanges			1
for those federal exchange consumers , the subsidies cover 76 percent of their premiums , on average			1
customers now pay an average of $ 82 on total monthly premiums averaging $ 346			0
the federal subsidy of $ 264 a month makes up the difference			0
but in october , the entire @entity30 appeals court voted to rehear the case and threw out the panel 's ruling , eliminating the so - called circuit split			0
the appeals argument has been scheduled for december 17 , but that case now recedes in importance with the @entity0 's action to step in			0
the case , @entity210 v. @entity211 , probably will be argued the first week in march , with a decision expected by late june			0
news of the @entity0 case broke just as president @entity3 was sitting down with congressional leaders , some of whom have threatened to repeal his signature law			0
if opponents of the law succeed in convincing the high court to rule in their favor , it could be easier for @entity168 leaders in @entity226 to get @entity227 on board with reforms to the bill given that millions of @entity231 the law was intended to benefit will be shut out of receiving the government subsidies that make compliance with the individual mandate portion of the law financially feasible for them			1
conservatives hope the law will unravel entirely , allowing lawmakers to redo health care reform from scratch			1
@entity168 and @entity227 lawmakers lined up on friday to weigh in on the court 's decision to review the subsidies clause in @entity12			1
@entity168 legislators of course trumpeted their support for the high court 's announcement while @entity227 slammed the suit as an attack on the less fortunate			1
' the @entity3 administration has been potentially doling out billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies without the proper statutory authority and i applaud the @entity0 ’s decision to review this case , ' @entity255 rep. @entity254 , a @entity168 , said in a statement			0
fellow @entity255 rep. @entity263 , one of several doctors in @entity226 , said that the case ' presents the best chance of finally abolishing president @entity3 ’s health care law ' because it is ' beyond clear ' that its unconstitutional for the @entity10 , a government bureaucracy , to be 're - writing a major portion of the @entity12 – an action reserved exclusively for @entity226			1
' ' this goes beyond health care to the very heart of our nation ’s democratic system of government , ' @entity263 said			1
' i hope the justices will rule accordingly by striking down this unconstitutional power grab by the @entity3 administration			0
' likewise , @entity281 chairman @entity280 claimed that ' the sloppy and rushed nature of the process that created the health law is rightly catching up to it			0
' ' the statute provides no authority for subsidies through the federal exchange , and proponents of the law can not cover - up their regrets by ignoring the plain text of the law when it proves inconvenient			1
' meanwhile , @entity227 rep. @entity295 , the ranking member on the @entity296 argued that the ' lawsuit misconstrues the intent of the authors of the @entity12			2
' pointing out the repercussions of the suit if the @entity0 sides with conservatives , @entity295 said , ' low - and middle - income @entity231 who live in states that chose not to establish their own marketplaces should not be penalized simply because their state decided to defer to the federal government			1
' as the ranking member of one of the committees that shaped and debated the healthcare law , i am confident that the @entity0 will recognize both the letter and intent of the law to ensure that financial assistance remains available in every state , ' the @entity310 representative said .			2

only @entity231 enrolled in health care through the federal exchange would be affected , not those enrolled through their state exchanges
law says that only @entity231 enrolled in state exchanges are eligible for government subsidies to help them afford health care insurance
@entity227 say court should abide by intent of the law , which is for all eligible low - and middle - income americans to receive aid
if the high court rules with opponents of the law , they hope @entity12 will unravel entirely , allowing @entity226 to redo health care reform from scratch
