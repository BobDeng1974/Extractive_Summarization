a broken neck would have put paid to most men 's hopes of achieving anything in life , but instead it drove @entity5 on to becoming @entity7 's strongest man			1
@entity5 , whose sister @entity8 appeared in @entity9 earlier this month , suffered the traumatic accident playing rugby union when he was only 20 years old			1
the future had initially looked bright for the young prop who presented @entity7 at under - 19 and under - 21 level in 1998 and 1999			1
but after playing a year professionally in @entity16 for @entity17 , disaster struck when he returned to @entity7 and broke his neck in pre-season scrum training with the @entity21			1
he met the action star at the @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity31 , a fortnight ago pulling a large truck is much easier than it seems according to @entity5 it could not have come at a worse time as the following weekend he was due to train with the @entity7 national front - row training squad in @entity38			1
‘ it happened at scrum training			2
it was just one of those things – an unfortunate training accident , ’ he told @entity40			2
‘ i was in hospital for about a month and had two surgeries			2
i was in a neck brace for six months			1
’ the road to recovery was a long one			2
just being able to drive his car again was a big ask , but it could have been worse			2
@entity54 up with bodybuilding he began competing in strongman events to better utilise his training @entity5 competes in the @entity59 competition in @entity60 last year			1
in this event he had to pull two trucks - the blue and maroon one behind are tied together - along a strip of road			2
@entity5 holds his sister @entity8 above his head at an event to raise funds for the @entity70 in @entity71			1
@entity8 recently appeared in @entity9 ‘ when i first got injured i could not use my right arm at all because i ’d lost all my feeling in it			1
i could n’t even eat my dinner ; i had to use my left hand all the time			2
it was a pretty tough time , ’ he explained			0
the physical suffering he endured though was nothing compared to the mental anguish he went through at the time			0
‘ it ’s not just the loss of a sport that you ’ve loved all your life , but it ’s the loss of a potential income as well , ' @entity5 told @entity40			1
' professional rugby was thriving , especially in @entity16 , and i thought i was set for life			1
but i could n’t have been more wrong			0
in this event at the @entity59 competition in @entity60 last year @entity5 has to throw kegs of different weights over a bar five metres in the air ‘ i do n’t think i ’ve ever got over it			1
i would n’t say i ’m bitter but i ’m still disappointed			0
i ’m now working flat out and struggling to pay bills , which is the complete opposite to what i would have had if i ’d been a professional rugby player			0
‘ but i have to remind myself that it could have been much worse and i may not have been able to even walk , so i have to constantly remember that			0
’ contact sport was now out for @entity5			1
he soon put on a huge amount of weight and did n’t know what to do with himself until a friend came up with an idea – why not try bodybuilding ? after moving into powerlifting in 2005 he set an @entity7 record in the discipline ‘ i had become depressed and was eating everything in sight			1
my weight ballooned , ’ he said			0
‘ but my friend got me back in the gym training again and a year later persuaded me to get on stage and compete in the @entity119			1
‘ it was the best thing i could have done and my confidence started coming back			0
’ but after a year of this @entity122 realised that what he enjoyed was the strength side of training rather than the appearance			2
the @entity127 is one of strongman 's signature events			1
here @entity5 raises one off the floor			1
the stones range in weight from 140 - 200 kilos			0
instead of showing people his toned body he wanted to show them how strong he was			0
he did this by lifting massive weights in the gym to start with , before moving into powerlifting where in 2005 he set an @entity7 record in the discipline			1
it was a simple transition after that to start competing in strongman competitions			1
‘ i always watched them on tv growing up			0
it was great to watch because they were big and strong , but they were also amazing athletes , ’ @entity5 said			1
the fact that competitors were great athletes as well as being immensely strong was what attracted @entity5 to taking part in the events @entity5 first competed in @entity155 in 2008 and 2009			1
the rest as they say is history			0
last year he won the @entity160 ’s @entity159 in @entity161 and @entity163 crown			0
he is also the only @entity7 to make the final of the @entity59 competition			1
unfortunately a muscle tear will rule him out of the 36th year of the @entity59 competition later this month in @entity168 , but he has nothing to prove at this stage			2
he has pulled and lifted airplanes , trucks and buses over the years			2
but it 's apparently easier than it sounds			2
@entity5 puts much of his success down to his wife @entity177 who also acts as his nutritionist and physiotherapist ‘ you ca n’t really train for it			1
you ca n’t go up to an airport and asked them to pull one of their planes			0
but funnily enough it ’s not the hardest thing to do , ’ he told @entity40			0
‘ it ’s more like conditioning work			0
it ’s like doing a high - rep squats session where you just keep your legs moving			0
it may look spectacular but in reality it is n’t			0
’ not that being @entity163 makes him the most famous person in his family			0
his sister @entity8 was a member of the @entity7 pop group @entity199 and recently appeared on television in @entity9			1
@entity201 ( left ) keeps in shape by working out regularly in her brother 's gym at the @entity205 @entity5 's daughter @entity207 was born seven weeks premature in december , but is now healthy and happy feeling the strain : a muscle tear has ruled @entity5 out of the 36th @entity59 competition in @entity168 his well known sister trains at the gym @entity5 runs in the @entity205			1
generally she does her workouts with her fiancée @entity214			0
‘ @entity8 trains at my gym every day and is into general fitness			1
she trains there with @entity214 regularly			0
all my family is into sport in some way or another			0
we ’ve got a very athletic background , ’ he told @entity40			0
the 35 - year - old trains four times a week for three hours each session doing a variety of weights regimes that will depend on the kind of strongman competition he 'll be competing in			2
generally he weighs in at between 145 - 150 kilos			0
@entity5 attributes much of his success to his wife @entity177 who is a former bodybuilder too			2
she has travelled with him to strongman competitions across the globe			1
‘ she acts as my trainer , my nutritionist , and my physiotherapist			0
she always makes sure i ’m in perfect condition for every event , ’ he said			0
@entity5 's story proves that with dedication and perseverance you can still achieve your goals the couple had their first baby , a girl called @entity207 , in december			1
and it sounds like she also has her father ’s fighting spirit			0
‘ she was born premature and arrived seven weeks early			0
she was three weeks in hospital in the @entity251 , but she ’s all healthy now and doing well , ’ @entity5 said .			2
