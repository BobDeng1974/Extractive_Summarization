@entity1 tennis found itself with a ready made second top 100 player on when @entity3 , the world no 83 , announced that he is now a @entity1 citizen			1
the 25 - year - old is originally from @entity6 but since 2008 has lived in @entity7 with his girlfriend @entity8 , a pop star in her native land who is a protegee of renowned record producer @entity12			1
@entity3 attended a citizenship ceremony in @entity14 on tuesday and posted pictures of the occasion			1
he will formally receive his passport within the next two weeks and start entering tournaments as a @entity1 player			0
@entity3 is pictured at his @entity1 citizenship ceremony in @entity14 on tuesday morning @entity3 poses for a picture with friends and family outside the petty sessional court building in @entity14 @entity3 was born in the @entity6 capital of @entity26 in 1989 but has made the @entity1 his home since 2008			1
the 25 - year - old lives in @entity29 and trains at @entity31 in @entity7 with @entity1 coach @entity32 and fitness trainer @entity33			1
@entity3 's career - high ranking was no 71 in february 2013 and he reached his first @entity36 tour final earlier this year when he finished runner - up at the @entity38 in january			1
however , whether he can play @entity39 for @entity40 is a different matter , as he has three times been in the @entity6 squad , albeit never having played a ' live ' rubber			0
he is appealing a new rule banning players from representing two nations on the basis that his citizenship application was being processed at the time			0
' today is one of the most special days of my life , ' said @entity3			0
' this has been a long process and to gain citizenship almost seven years to the day after arriving is just overwhelming			0
' this is something i have wanted since the moment i stepped foot in this beautiful country and i feel honoured to be able to compete under the @entity61 on the @entity36			0
@entity39 is another dream and one i will have to fight for with everything i have			0
' @entity3 is the most significant @entity1 tennis import since @entity64			1
a quick and agile baseliner , he has already been ranked no 71 in the world and after being held back by injuries last year ought to be heading into the top 50 before too long			2
he has long been managed by @entity69 - based firm @entity68 and has a @entity1 coach in @entity32			2
he has actually represented @entity29 in the @entity72 , the team being captained by tennis nut @entity12 , famous for his @entity74 production			0
bedene in action against @entity77 at the @entity78 in @entity79 earlier this year @entity75 ( right ) with girlfriend @entity8 , who is a pop singer in her native land of @entity6 @entity3 will now slot in as @entity1 no 2 although it must be highly unlikely he could play in the @entity39 quarter - final after @entity85 against @entity86 , especially after @entity88 's heroics against the @entity89 in the first round			1
the likes of @entity88 , who has been a stalwart of the @entity39 team through thick and thin , might understandably be peeved were @entity3 suddenly to walk into the team			0
otherwise there should not be too much friction as @entity3 , who is certainly not a product of the @entity97 or the @entity1 game , is not competing for wildcards or funding			2
@entity101 has welcomed the news of @entity3 's switch and feels that he could be a useful addition to the @entity39 team in future years			1
@entity101 told @entity105 : ' i do n't know him extremely well but i know that he 's obviously playing some very good tennis right now			2
@entity3 plays on the grass of @entity110 's @entity109 at the 2013 @entity111 the @entity113 team celebrate their victory against the @entity89 in @entity115 earlier this month ' i think maybe in the future it 's possible for him to be involved in the @entity39 team but i 'm not sure exactly what the rules are			2
' i know the rules change a little bit this year , that you 're not allowed to play for two countries , so i 'm not 100 per cent sure if he 's going to be eligible			0
' this year we have a team that 's being doing extremely well and i would expect that this year we would stick with that team and revisit it again in the future if he becomes eligible			0
' @entity1 no 4 @entity129 - who will drop to no 5 when @entity3 officially starts representing @entity1 on the tour - was also warm in his reaction , tweeting : ' welcome to @entity40 mate			1

@entity3 officially became a @entity1 citizen at a ceremony on tuesday
the @entity6 born 25 - year - old is currently ranked no 83 in the world
@entity101 has welcomed @entity75 's switch in citizenship
