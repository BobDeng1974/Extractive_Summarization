when it comes to losing their virginity , most women wait for the right man , while others prefer to wait for the right price			2
@entity6 , 27 , has decided to auction off her virginity online and hopes to get at least $ 400,000 for the exchange			1
‘ the reason mainly was the money , ’ miss @entity6 tells @entity9			1
anonymous : at first @entity12 tried to protect her identity , with images on her @entity6 website carefully concealing her face @entity6 , pictured here , has started a blog in which she is detailing her journey from being a virgin to a ' whore , ' as she auctions off her virginity online ‘ i have no emotional attachment whatsoever to my virginity and never have , which is why it ’s so easy for me to do this			1
‘ more to the point , why would i not want to do it ? ‘ it ’s a compelling and easy way to make money			2
’ miss @entity6 says she understand that , for some women , losing their virginity is a significant moment in their lives			1
but , according to her , it ’s merely a physical act and this is nothing more than a business transaction			0
‘ sex is just sex , ’ she says			2
miss @entity6 has never had any form of sex , including letting a man see her naked			2
nor has she seen a naked man in the flesh			0
‘ i ’ve dated but for no more than two to three months and have never had a boyfriend because i ’ve never felt anyone i ’ve connected that strongly to and who ’s made me think that sex is anything more than a physical act			2
‘ i like guys but i ’ve just never felt strongly enough for anyone or had a real emotional connection			2
‘ i study , work on projects and spend time with my friends and that ’s enough for me			0
while her friends have been largely supportive , miss @entity6 ’s brother – understandably - is n’t so keen on the idea of his sister auctioning off her virginity to the highest bidder			1
‘ my friends think it ’s my choice and trust me implicitly , but my brother definitely has some moral objections to the idea , ’ she says			0
‘ it has n’t affected our relationship			0
he knows i am smart and trusts me to execute it properly			0
’ what is perhaps even more surprising , is miss @entity6 ’s unequivocal support from her parents , who she says accepted the choice ‘ easily			1
’ in her blog , 27 - year - old @entity6 , pictured here , writes that she is comfortably off and is n't simply selling her virginity for cash - she claims she will donate 35 per cent to charity ‘ they could tell i ’d given it a lot of thought and that i was smart enough to do it properly , ’ she says			1
miss @entity6 started her blog , @entity89 , ‘ several months ’ ago , though her various posts date back to february 1st 2014			1
in her posts , she answers questions such as , ‘ is n’t this prostitution ? ’ ‘ what kind of doctor will a girl like me be ? ’ and ‘ can a virgin whore still be a feminist ? ' because prostitution is largely illegal in the @entity99 , miss @entity6 has found an agent and publicist in @entity102 , @entity103 , where prostitution laws are more relaxed and will , as miss @entity6 says , ‘ permit this exchange			1
’ she will be deciding on the winning bidder , and maintains that her endeavour is ‘ 100 per cent legal			0
’ she will be paying taxes and even donating 35 per cent of her fortune to charity , though would prefer not to disclose which one			0
miss @entity6 is a medical student in the @entity99 , but has not disclosed at which college			1
@entity6 , pictured here , stands by her decision to sell her virginity , and says , ' i can not imagine losing it in any other way ' the photos on her blog show her slim body in a tight , slinky black dress with her blonde hair but face out of the eye of the camera			1
in an interview with @entity128 , miss @entity6 said she hopes to earn upwards of $ 400,000 from the auction , which she expects to last for roughly a month			1
‘ i do n’t really know how the bids will work , my agent will be handling it all , ’ miss @entity6 tells @entity9			1
she will ‘ probably ’ go for the highest bidder , as long as she has no ‘ major objections			0
’ ‘ i do n’t care who he is really , as long as he ’s not a psychopath and we get on well , then i ’ll be happy , ' she says			0
' we ’ll do some sort of background check and i ’ll definitely have communication with him beforehand , probably a few emails and a @entity145			0
‘ if i feel unsafe at any point i 'll not go through with it , but i do n't feel strongly that i need to meet him beforehand			0
’ whilst miss @entity6 says she has n’t ironed out all the details of the exchange , she says that for his payment the winner will receive 12 hours in her company in a high end hotel , with security and her friends and family knowing where she is at all times			1
‘ i wo n’t have anyone waiting outside the room with a baseball bat or anything , ’ she says			0
and anyone hoping for a @entity164 - style ending , with a couple falling in love after he ’s paid her for sex , will be left disappointed			0
‘ i have a good understand of what this is and know myself well enough to know that it wo n’t affect me emotionally it ’s nothing more than a one - night exchange and unlikely i ’ll form any emotional attachment			2
‘ i mean , any girl runs that risk when they sleep with a man , whether or not she ’s being paid			0
