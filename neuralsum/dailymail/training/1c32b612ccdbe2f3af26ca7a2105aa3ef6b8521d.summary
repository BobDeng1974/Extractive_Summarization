sweeping new anti-terror laws were published by the government today - less than 24 hours after a damning @entity3 report into the murder of fusilier @entity5 by @entity7 fanatics			1
a new counter-terrorism and @entity8 , containing a range of draconian powers including orders to block suspected @entity14 jihadists from returning to the @entity14 , was introduced to @entity15			2
it comes after an official report into the may 2013 murder of @entity19 revealed a series of missed opportunities by the security services to prevent the attack			1
a statutory duty will be placed on named organisations - such as colleges , universities , the police and probation providers - to help deter radicalisation and , where organisations fail , ministers will be able to issue court - enforced directions to them			1
police are to be handed powers in the new bill to force internet firms to hand over details that could help identify suspected terrorists and paedophiles , while police and border staff will be given the power to seize the passports of terror suspects			1
its second reading in @entity15 - the first opportunity for mps to debate the main principles of the bill - will take place tomorrow			2
home secretary @entity64 may the bill included a ‘ considered , targeted set of proposals that will help to keep us safe at a time of very significant danger by ensuring we have the powers we need to defend ourselves ’			1
but @entity71 accused the government of ‘ rushing through ’ a ‘ grab - bag of measures without proper scrutiny or challenge ’			1
drummer @entity5 was almost decapitated in a brutal attack outside @entity79 barracks last year @entity80 , left , and @entity81 , right , were jailed for life for the murder of @entity5 last year @entity84 yesterday announced an extra £ 130million would be handed to the security services to help identify lone wolf terrorists			1
mr @entity84 vowed to take steps to try to ensure the police , @entity87 and @entity88 can successfully fight back against plots			1
the pm also revealed new laws , set to be introduced to @entity15 tomorrow , would help move terror suspects away from their extremist associates and strip passports from people trying to travel into war zones			1
the @entity92 said : ‘ we will not shrink from doing what is necessary to keep our people safe			0
' yesterday 's long - awaited report into @entity19 's killing revealed that the two killers - @entity81 and @entity80 - had appeared in seven different investigations by @entity87 and @entity88 before they launched their attack			1
@entity15 's @entity107 criticised the security services for ' delays ' in their investigations which at times was ' inadequate			2
' but it said given what the agencies knew at the time ' they were not in a position to prevent the murder of @entity118 '			0
however it slammed giant internet firms for failing to hand over key pieces of information which might have helped security chiefs stop the attacks			1
it said @entity80 detailed a threat to kill a soldier , posted on his @entity129 account in december 2012 , was ' highly significant '			1
in the most explosive section of the report , it states : ' had @entity87 had access to this exchange at the time , @entity80 would have become a top priority			1
there is then a significant possibility that @entity87 would have been able to prevent the attack			2
' the main findings of the report also included : @entity84 told mps he would not introduce emergency laws in response to today 's report but said there were lessons to be learnt @entity148 social media giant @entity129 allegedly failed to close down @entity80 's personal account - even after he used it to post explicit threats to kill a soldier			1
today 's report said : ' they left the one that said … “ let ’s kill a soldier ”			2
that did n’t meet their criteria [ for closure ]			0
' while mps and peers refused to name the company in question , it was later reported to be @entity129			0
the report criticised internet companies for their refusal to cooperate with security services to help stop terror attacks			1
it said it was ' clear ' that social media companies could have ' made a difference ' if they alerted @entity14 authorities to online messages in which @entity80 threatened to kill a soldier			2
the report says the company which hosted the terror exchange ' does not regard themselves as under any obligation to ensure that they identify such threats , or to report them to the authorities '			0
it added : ' we find this unacceptable : however unintentionally , they are providing a safe haven for terrorists			0
none of the major @entity148 companies the committee approached proactively monitor and review suspicious content on their systems , largely relying on users to notify them of offensive or suspicious content			0
none of them regard themselves as compelled to comply with @entity14 warrants obtained under the @entity202			0
that means that even if @entity87 had a warrant for the information before the attack , the company might not have responded			1
@entity81 and @entity80 ran down @entity118 , who was dressed in a @entity210 hoodie , in a @entity211 near @entity212 , in south - east @entity213 , before savagely attacking the defenceless soldier as he lay in the road			1
as armed police arrived , the two men charged the vehicle , with @entity80 brandishing a rusted , unloaded revolver			2
they were both shot at the scene			0
the killers were convicted of murder at the @entity223 in december last year and were later sentenced to whole life and life with a minimum of 45 years respectively			2
a terrorist magazine which acts as a guide for fanatics to carry out atrocities in the @entity231 is still available online – despite being the inspiration for @entity5 ’s murder			2
‘ @entity238 ’ , a quarterly journal for extremists , is a ‘ pernicious ’ threat which ‘ exhorts violent action and gives recipes on how to do so ’ , the committee said			0
the report states : ' @entity87 has told the committee of the link between @entity238 and individuals involved in planning @entity14 attacks : ‘ we can now say that @entity238 has been read by those involved in at least seven out of the ten attacks planned within the @entity14 since its first issue [ in 2010 ]			1
@entity250 mp @entity249 has demanded a crack down on extremist material ‘ we judge that it significantly enhanced the capability of individuals in four of these ten attack plots			0
’ despite the influence of the @entity259 magazine @entity257 was able to download the latest edition – @entity261 – within minutes of today ’s publication			2
in the online journal , it tells extremists that ‘ @entity148 is our first target , followed by the @entity14 , @entity267 and other crusader countries			0
’ it directs terrorists to bomb @entity272 games , tennis tournaments – and even the @entity275 hotel			0
it tells jihadists : ' you have the soccer ( football ) stadiums especially during @entity272 and @entity283 matches			0
they have worldwide live media coverage			0
' in the beginning of summer , we have @entity287 , and the end of summer we have @entity289 , hereby horse races are attended by thousands from around the kingdom including the @entity292			0
' there are also @entity295 tournaments			0
' today ’s report said it should be ‘ sufficient grounds ’ for the security services to launch surveillance on anyone caught reading the magazine			1
it stated : ' engagement with extremist media should be taken extremely seriously			0
for example , @entity238 magazine provides advice and guidance to individuals on how to commit terrorist attacks in the @entity14			0
‘ in most cases , engaging with extremist media such as @entity238 should be sufficient grounds to justify intrusive action			0

@entity19 killed by @entity81 and @entity80 last year
official report slammed ' delays ' monitoring killers helping terror attack
following report , ministers publish draconian new counter-terror bill
it will ban insurance companies from footing the bill for terrorist ransoms
colleges , universities and police will have to help deter radicalisation
police to be handed powers to force internet firms to hand over information
border staff given the power to seize the passports of terror suspects
@entity87 delayed submitting an **application** to monitor @entity80 before he struck in may last year ;
without the delay @entity87 would ' probably ' have set up surveillance on @entity80 in ' the days before the attack ’ ;
the **application** was sitting on the home secretary @entity353 ’s desk at the time of the killing - having only been handed in the day before ;
@entity87 were trailing @entity80 's *accomplice* @entity81 from december 2012 to april 2013 ;
however , undercover agents did not discover anything of ‘ national security *concern* ’ ;
this meant that @entity87 had to cancel their surveillance of @entity363 in april 2013 – just weeks before the attack .
