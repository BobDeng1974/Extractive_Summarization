it is one of the most important weeks of the political calendar - a time when the prime minister must convince his party that he is taking @entity6 in the right direction			1
but @entity8 hardly seemed raring to go today as the @entity9 got under way			1
rubbing his eyes and stifling a yawn , the @entity9 leader looked as though he might fall asleep as foreign secretary @entity14 addressed delegates in @entity16			1
he is to present himself as the heir to @entity32 , vowing he is ‘ not for turning ’ on the need to tackle @entity6 ’s debt			0
and the prime minister will go further , claiming to have done more to reform schools , pensions and the @entity38 than the @entity39			1
making clear his determination to stick his economic plan , mr @entity8 said today : ' i want us to be the party that actually levels with the @entity6 public and talks very plainly and straightly about what needs to be done			1
' the fact is we have to find those spending reductions , and if we want to avoid cuts in things like hospitals and school and the services that we all rely on , we have to look at things like the welfare budget , where we ’re still spending , as a country , £ 80bn on working - age welfare			0
positive : the prime minister manages a smile as he sits next to @entity14 's wife @entity27 on the first day of the @entity9 crucial week : @entity8 , pictured with @entity14 's wife @entity27 , is under pressure to reassure @entity9 activists without appearing to abandon the political centre ground ' that ’s not the pensions , not the disability benefits , but working age welfare , ' he told @entity72 's @entity71			1
but mr @entity8 risks a row with his @entity75 coalition partners , after publicly ruling out their idea of a mansion tax as an attack on people who work hard to buy their own own			1
the @entity75 want an levy on all homes worth more than £ 2million			0
but mr @entity8 today said : ' i do n't actually believe we should be a country where if you work hard , you save , you buy yourself a house , you try and pay down the mortgage , you save and invest into that house - i do n't want to be a country that comes after you every year with a massive great tax			1
' so that is not going to happen			0
but we have put extra taxes where people buy expensive properties			0
' we will always be fair and seen to be fair , ' he told the @entity72			2
in a series of interviews today , the @entity97 has admitted he must ‘ raise his game ’ in order to avoid a repeat of the bungling u-turns which have seen his personal ratings , and those of his party , nosedive			2
@entity108 and @entity8 arrived at the @entity109 @entity16 today for the start of the @entity9 conference where the prime minister unveiled a raft of policies aimed at boosting his opinion poll ratings @entity8 told @entity72 's @entity71 that he would would rule out the @entity75 's mansion tax an @entity120 / @entity119 poll today put @entity121 on 41 per cent , up to points , with @entity123 on 30 per cent and the @entity75 on nine			1
but mr @entity8 will us the conference to insist he will not be diverted from his austerity plans , demanding billions of pounds of public spending cuts , in an echo of mrs @entity32 ’s famous ‘ the lady ’s not for turning ’ promise at the @entity9 conference in 1980			1
@entity8 and his ministers will use the @entity9 conference to unveil a raft of policies in an attempt to boost the party 's opinion poll ratings			1
they include : ministers are buoyed by improving economic figures , but are anxious about being seen to publicly predict ' green shoots ' of recovery			2
@entity144 , the chancellor , said he thought the economy was ' healing '			2
today , mr @entity8 said he could not predict the next set of economic figures , but was confident that the economy was being rebalanced			1
but others are more publicly optimistic			0
defence secretary @entity150 claimed that the public would see real economic improvement by 2014 , provided the @entity153 remained stable			1
' you wo n't find anybody , hardly anybody in the business community or in the financial community , who thinks that the economy is doing right now what the data tell us it is doing , ' mr @entity150 told @entity119			1
both the conservatives and @entity164 @entity75 have made clear that their election prospects in 2015 will depend on the state of the economy			0
he admits he must do more to ‘ explain ’ what the government is doing			2
‘ you spend a lot of time governing and deciding , and you do n’t spend enough time explaining			0
‘ and i think conference week is a real opportunity to get out there and explain			2
’ but he makes clear there will be no deviation from the need for tough decisions on the economy			0
mr @entity8 said : ‘ i think the @entity6 public are extremely fair minded			1
‘ i think they know that @entity6 faces difficult circumstances , they know the hole that we ’re in is quite a deep one , they know it takes time to get out , ’ he told the @entity183			0
‘ of course , there are things that we ’ve done that they do n’t like , of course there are things they wish we had done differently			0
that ’s in the nature of things but , the public know this is difficult and tough , and it ’s a five year parliament , and my sense is that they ’ll judge us at the end of it rather than half way through it			0
‘ we ’ve got a lot to prove and there ’s no doubt that the mountain in front of us has got steeper and more difficult to climb			0
’ @entity8 used interviews today to insist he will not be diverted from his ' austerity ' economic plan but promised help for homeowners and commuters the sun shone on the first day of the @entity9 conference , as senior ministers struck a more upbeat tone on the state of the economy the conference theme ‘ @entity6 can deliver ’ will focus on the economy and try to present a more upbeat vision of the future			1
as delegates gather in @entity16 , the pm brushed aside claims he had failed to take tough decisions and boasted that he had been bolder than @entity32			0
' so have we dithered over educational reform ? mrs @entity32 never reformed public sector pensions			0
‘ mrs @entity32 never vetoed a @entity238 treaty			0
‘ capping welfare payments — no government has ever done that , ’ he told the @entity240 ' if we just wanted to be popular , we would not have targeted the deficit			0
' strategists hope that taking a tough line with @entity247 will recreate the opinion poll boost enjoyed by the conservatives after mr @entity8 vetoed a new treaty in december last year			1
the @entity97 today said he would block ' outrageous ' attempts to increase the overall @entity38 budget in looming talks on spending for 2014 to 2020			2
' if it comes to saying ' no ' to a deal that is n't right for @entity6 , i 'll say ' no ' , ' he told @entity183			0
@entity8 claimed today that he had been bolder than @entity32 as he promised to block ' outrageous ' @entity38 demands for an even bigger budget and he set out a ' bold thinking ' idea which would split the @entity38 budgets into one for the 17 eurozone nations and another for the 10 - including @entity6 - outside the single currency			2
in one of the most eye - catching announcements , mr @entity8 said the government would cap rises in rail fares			1
train companies were going to be allowed to raise the average price of regulated fares - which include season tickets - by @entity273 inflation plus three per cent in january 2013 and then again in january 2014			0
but mr @entity8 said that the rise for the next two years will be limited to @entity273 plus one per cent , or 4.2 per cent instead of the planned 6.2 per cent			1
some commuters will be over £ 200 better off over the two years			0
the @entity97 insisted it was proof that he was not abandoning the political centre ground			2
' are the @entity9 deserting the common ground of @entity6 politics ? absolutely not			2
@entity8 announced that from january , season tickets will rise by 4.2 per cent , and not the planned 6.2 per cent ' i think the common ground of @entity6 politics , right now , ought to be [ doing ] everything you can to fire up the engines of enterprise and aspiration to get the economy moving , while holding onto the things that people care about passionately , like the @entity290			2
i think that is absolutely where we are			0
' but mr @entity8 ruled out cuts to benefits for wealthy pensioners			1
' let me be absolutely clear , the promise that i made at the last election to @entity6 's pensioners when i said we are not going to take away your winter fuel allowance , your free tv licences , your free bus passes - that promise stands			0
' the prime minister also defended the decision to reduce the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p - seized on by @entity121 as a ' tax cut for millionaires '			1
' the richest 10 per cent in our country are not only paying more in income tax , they are paying a greater percentage of the total income tax take than they ever did under @entity121 , ' mr @entity8 said			1
but @entity121 's @entity319 renewed the attack on the @entity123			0
' @entity8 ca n't be a @entity322 prime minister			1
he says one thing , but time and again does another , ' mr @entity319 said			0
' he says those at the top will need to pay more , but he is the man whose top priority is to cut taxes for millionaires , giving 8,000 people earning over £ 1 million a tax break of £ 40,000 this april			2
