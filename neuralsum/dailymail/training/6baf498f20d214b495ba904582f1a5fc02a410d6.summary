@entity1 's last - gasp goal forced an @entity3 third round replay as @entity4 came from behind to draw 1 - 1 with @entity5 rivals @entity6			1
@entity8 's @entity7 takes you through the talking points from tuesday night 's clash at @entity12			2
toffees trio know way to @entity14 @entity4 have n't won a major trophy for 20 years but three of their starters on tuesday night already have @entity3 winners ' medals			1
@entity19 could add another @entity3 medal to his cabinet if @entity4 go the distance thirty - seven - year - old defender @entity23 was in the @entity25 team that lifted the cup in 2008 , @entity19 played for @entity27 when they were triumphant in 2011 and goalkeeper @entity28 was in the @entity30 line - up when they shocked @entity27 at @entity14 in 2013			1
@entity4 sub @entity32 also played for @entity30 in that final			0
no - @entity34 shows his class @entity36 was his usual uncomplicated self despite speculation over his future			0
the 26 - year - old @entity39 is a defenders ' defender and had to be at his most alert with opponent , @entity1 , even bigger and stronger than he is			0
@entity36 's reading of the game was excellent and saved his goalkeeper @entity47 with one clearance , the question is whether he has enough finesse on the ball for a club like @entity52 as he enters the last six months of his contract at @entity54			0
@entity6 defender @entity36 did enough to keep @entity1 at bay until the dying seconds recent @entity3 history favoured @entity6 who had not lost to @entity4 in the competition since 1957 when future managers @entity60 and @entity62 were in their line - up			1
the most famous cup meeting between the clubs came in a 1980 semi-final replay when @entity67 scored the winning goal for @entity69			2
no romance at @entity12 the lack of atmosphere at @entity12 was in contrast to what neighbours @entity74 experienced at @entity75 the previous evening			0
plenty of empty blue seats made it feel more like an under - 21s development game ; tuesday nights under the floodlights should be reserved for @entity3 replays , not third round ties made - for - tv			0
there were plenty of empty seats at @entity12 as just 22,236 fans attended the @entity3 clash it was n't warm on @entity90 , but certainly not freezing			1
maybe you could just about excuse @entity4 's @entity94 from wearing gloves , he is from @entity96 close to the equator			1
but was it really necessary for @entity99 , a @entity101 international whose formative football years were spent in northern @entity102 with @entity103 , to cover up on such a benign evening			0
@entity96 @entity94 can be forgiven for wearing gloves during the game @entity101 international @entity99 wore gloves on a not - so - cold night at @entity12 in the @entity3			2

@entity108 ' *header* gave the @entity69 the lead at @entity12
@entity1 equalised at the death to force a third round replay
@entity4 's @entity19 , @entity23 and @entity28 have won @entity3
