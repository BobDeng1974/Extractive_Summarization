by @entity0 published : 13:02 est , 26 february 2013 updated : 13:17 est , 26 february 2013 when @entity1 came around after blacking out at @entity3 tube station she was initially worried that a family history of neurological illness had caught up with her			1
her first thought was to see a doctor and get a check up			0
a week on from the black out in november 2011 , still concerned about her family medical history , she called @entity11 and asked them to review @entity13 footage of her fall so that she had more details of what had happened			1
unbeknown to @entity1 , she had been viciously punched in the side of the head by @entity20 in an unprovoked assault			1
transport police said that they 'd never seen anything like the incident before			0
miss @entity1 , who was a third year political science student at the time , had a broken tooth and pain and swelling in her jaw			1
but @entity1 was n't alone			2
a second 16 - year - old girl was also knocked unconscious in an almost identical attack on the street outside the same station a year later			1
she was left with broken teeth and a split lip			0
after that assault police released @entity13 footage of the shocking assault and @entity20 was arrested after a tip off from a member of the public who recognised his face on the clip			1
brutal : as well as the attack on @entity1 , @entity20 also attacked a 16 - year - old girl in @entity3			1
he is pictured on @entity13 footage running up behind her vicious : @entity20 throws a punch at his 16 - year - old victim outside @entity3 tube station he later admitted the two attacks			1
yesterday , cannabis smoking @entity61 was jailed for four years at @entity62			2
although he admitted two counts of @entity64 , @entity20 originally told police his teenage victim had ‘ started it ’ by making him ‘ feel like a pauper with her facial gestures			1
’ in interview , he told officers he could not cope with ‘ taking an insult from a little person like that			0
’ prosecutor @entity75 told the court : ' what is most shocking about these offences is that they seem to flare up from nothing			0
' he is a danger to the public and in particular women			0
' miss @entity1 , currently working as an @entity84 teacher in @entity85 , told the @entity86 after the sentencing : ' it ( the sentence ) wo n't make me feel any safer going back to @entity90 , but i 'm happy justice has been served			2
' horrific : the 16 - year - old , who can not be named because of her age , is thrown to the ground following the assault she added that she was lucky to be alive after the attack saying : people die from blows to the head all the time			1
' both myself and the other young lady are lucky to be alive			0
' it also emerged today that this is the third time the thug has been jailed for attacks on innocent members of the public			1
in october 2009 he received a 90 day sentence for an attack on a woman in the street after spitting on her shoe			0
when she said it was disgusting he followed her , demanded an apology then punched her in the face			0
and just two months later in december 2009 he was locked up for three months for punching a man in the face as he talked on his mobile phone			0
the court had heard that @entity20 , who smoked up to ten cannabis joints a day , told his victim afterwards : ' i ’m sorry , that was n’t meant for you			1
' when he was arrested he told police : ' shut up p * * * * * or i ’ll punch you in the head			0
' @entity130 , defending @entity131 - born @entity20 , said her client accepted his behaviour was ‘ shocking ’ and added his use of cannabis could have possibly added to his attitude			2
jailing him at @entity62 judge @entity137 said he was ‘ deeply troubled ’ by @entity20 ’s lack of explanation for his actions			2
in police interview the thug told officers he had drunk a cup of vodka and smoked three or four spliffs before carrying out the attack on the teenage girl			1
he was examined by medical experts but they were unable to find any mental health problems			0
one doctor said he presented a ‘ high risk to others and particularly women			0
’ injured : the girl was knocked unconscious in the shocking attack and left with broken teeth and a split lip stricken : @entity20 is seen running off at the top of the shot as his victim lies unconscious on the pavement in @entity3 , east @entity163 , following the attack the judge agreed and told him : ' i am satisfied it is my job to do what i can to offer the public a measure of protection from you			1
” he said the cctv images were worth ‘ many thousands of words ’ and captured ‘ graphically the shocking violence of the attack			2
’ he told the defendant he was using his powers to increase the sentence to the maximum four years , as well as adding an extra year on to his licence period			2
he said : ' these are the sorts of attack which causes the public , on whose behalf i must sentence , an ever greater concern , a fear for their own safety when out , even during the hours of daylight			0
' the sentence must be a deterrent to you and others			0
i must reflect that public concern for offences as violent as this and the public must be protected from you			0
