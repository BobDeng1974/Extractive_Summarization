@entity0 dropped as many as 20 inches of snow in the @entity2 last week closing down roads , schools , and even public transportation			1
photographer @entity6 decided to take a snow day with his camera and visited the now abandoned @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 to photograph it once again			1
when @entity6 arrived at the mall last week he was pleasantly surprised to discover the dark and dingy shell of a shopping center had been transformed into a winter wonderland			1
remembering that the mall skylights were broken during his last visit , @entity6 decided to venture out to see just how much snow got through to the interior			1
' i went because i knew that the skylights were a little compromised last time i was there , but i never anticipated that they were in such bad shape to the point that that much snow got into the mall , ' @entity6 told @entity58			1
@entity6 , who told @entity39 last last year that he once worked at the mall and he would visit often as a child , said that the snow reminded him of fake snow , holiday decorations , and of the mall in its heyday			1
skylight : @entity6 decided to re-visit the mall after the storm because he remembered that the skylights were broken during his last visit and he knew some snow would get inside ghost town : the mall has no shoppers on the escalators but with all the snow one might want to take a sled and dive down the ramp @entity76 : the abandoned mall is dark and falling apart but the snow allows for the light to reflect and recreates some of the mall 's former brightness ' i think that 's maybe what makes it so magical in a sense , it 's like you 're walking into a snow globe , ' he told the @entity58			1
' for me it was n't so dark and creepy this time around			0
it was kind of magical			0
' when @entity6 was photographing the mall in 2012 and 2013 his goal was not to show the mall 's magical side but to represent the economic decline of @entity98 and especially @entity11			1
' the goal was to show the world a different side of @entity98			0
i think an abandoned mall is symbolic of the economic decline of @entity98 and is a true indication of what happens when cities like @entity109 suffers massive population loss due to loss of manufacturing jobs , ' he told @entity39			1
ice cave : the @entity20 mall has been transformed into a snowy wonderland after heavy snowfall snowlight : even though the mall is in a closed space , the snow leaked in through the skylights dark : the mall photographed by @entity6 a few years ago was much darker without snow even with rays of light inching through the skylight ' @entity109 has lost nearly half its population since these malls opened in the mid- 1970 , ' @entity6 added			1
' we 're not talking white flight here			0
people fled the state to find jobs and the problem has n't gotten any better			0
' my city is not only losing jobs			0
we â€™re losing people and it 's frightening			0
during my recent art curation at the @entity142 i spent most of that time urging @entity109 residents and city officials to adopt a plan to merge @entity146 with @entity109 so we can maintain our population , because doing nothing is no longer an option			0
' @entity6 returned to the malls , which were closed in 2008 and 2009 , to document them before demolition crews move in and flatten the buildings later this year			1
he explained that when @entity156 mall was built it was the largest in the world , with 5,000 employees			2
' it was such an intricate part of the city that the town is represented by the two shopping bags appearing in the municipal seal , ' he said			0
empty : though people no longer shop in the mall one could build snowmen to fill the space after the storm covered the abandoned shopping center @entity170 : @entity6 likened the abandoned mall to a real life snow globe crumbling : this photograph taken of the abandoned mall without snow for @entity6 ' book is far less enchanting than the photos of the mall covered in snow ' i chose to focus on malls for this book because i think a mall is a human connector			1
we all can relate to a mall in a very personal way			2
we all remember spending time there and for the most part it was in happier times , ' @entity6 said			2
' i remember visiting @entity191 as a kid at these malls during @entity194 and eventually getting my first job at the mall			2
the mall had character and the architecture was beautiful			2
' the once gleaming walkways and modern designs look outdated and grimy in his images , and it is hard to imagine the buildings filled with families and friends enjoying a day out			2
but when @entity6 returned , his memories helped bring the malls back to life			2
' strangely enough as i explored these abandoned malls i found myself acting like a kid all over again			0
at times jumping up on to nearby fountain ledges trying to balance myself as i became mesmerized all over again by the futuristic skylights that dangled fearlessly over my head			0
' it was enough beauty to make your chest feel like it was going to cave in ... all over again			0
' the self - declared ' artivist ' , who combines activism through works of art , promotes his work on inequality and injustice through his @entity229 and on his @entity231 and @entity232 accounts			0
he said his work often is seen as controversial but that it leads to ' constructive dialogue and healthy debate '			0
spot of hope : the snow breathes new life into the abandoned and dark @entity9 once busting : the mall once held thousands of people and now is an abandoned snowy terrain empty and poor : when @entity6 was photographing the mall in 2012 and 2013 his goal was not to show the mall 's magical side but to represent the economic decline of @entity98 and especially @entity11			1
