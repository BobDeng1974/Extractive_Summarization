it may be the last regular event of the @entity2 year but for some players the @entity3 is all about comebacks - in more ways than one			2
@entity9 @entity8 plays his first competitive golf in three months after injury ruled him out of his @entity9 @entity13 defence , the @entity12 and the @entity14 but for others the focus is on ensuring they make appearances next season			1
with only the top 78 in the race to @entity23 rankings going through to the final series of four tournaments , this event is the last chance for players to secure a place in that			0
more important for others is to secure their cards , as come sunday the top 111 players on the list will retain their playing privileges for the 2015 @entity2 season			0
@entity8 plays his first competitive golf in three months after injury ruled him out of his @entity9 @entity13 defence @entity39 's @entity38 currently occupies the last available place - courtesy of @entity42 's 66th - placed @entity41 being only an affiliate member so he is not included in the top 110 cut - off			1
the 25 - year - old has made the cut in his last three events and needs to do so again to consolidate his position while former @entity2 winners @entity50 @entity49 ( 174th ) and @entity52 's @entity51 ( 131st ) have to perform much better			2
@entity8 , one of three major champions in the field alongside @entity55 and @entity56 , committed to the event at @entity58 back in may and so did not want to let down organisers after his shoulder and neck problems			1
@entity8 celebrates on the 18th green after his two - stroke victory at the 95th @entity65 in 2013 ' it it has been about 11 weeks since i last played so it is getting better , ' he told @entity70			1
' it was frustrating to miss the last major , the play - offs and @entity14 but in the end it was probably nice to do it			1
' it was nice to get my fitness and health better and i worked on one of my weaknesses which was my putting			0
' i 've had a couple of weeks with no pain swinging the golf club and they have told me i ca n't do more damage			0
' @entity87 @entity86 , who was a member of @entity89 's victorious @entity14 team , is among the favourites this week			1
' it 's better to be one of the favourites but i will just try to do my best , ' said the 24 - year - old			0
' there are a lot of good players			0
@entity8 , @entity55 , and also some players who played a lot in the @entity100 and are just at the limit of qualifying for the @entity103 and this is the last tournament before that			2

@entity107 ruled @entity9 @entity8 out of defending his @entity9 @entity13 title
' it was frustrating to miss the last major , the play - offs and @entity14 , ' says @entity8
