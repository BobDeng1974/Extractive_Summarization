a former director of the @entity1 and the @entity2 warned on sunday that the @entity3 , @entity3 , is destined to launch attacks on the @entity5 and other @entity7 countries in its race to wage jihad and attract followers in the @entity12 world			1
' @entity3 is a very powerful local terrorist organization and probably a reasonably powerful regional terrorist organization , ' retired gen. @entity14 told a sunday morning @entity16 audience , ' but it 's one that has global ambitions			1
' @entity23 militants flying the @entity3 flag include ' @entity5 passport holders ' and ' @entity21 passport holders , ' he said			1
' so if it is not tuesday , it 's at a time and place of their choosing			2
and it will come probably sooner rather than later			2
' they see that as a winning ideology , a winning strategy , ' he said on @entity64 , and they want to be a part of it , and that ’s what makes it so dangerous			2
' ' they are one plane ticket away from @entity5 shores and that ’s why we ’re so concerned about it			1
' @entity77 have posted online warnings which , whether serious or not , threaten attacks on @entity5 cities			1
the @entity81 is investigating a tweeted photo showing someone holding up a smartphone , displaying a picture of the @entity3 flag , in front of the @entity88			1
' [ @entity90 ] e are here # @entity5 near our # target : ) sooooooooooooon , ' read the message that accompanied it on august 9			1
the taunting message followed a separate photo that first appeared online on june 30			0
it showed a hand - written note in @entity99 , dated june 20 , held up in front of the @entity43 in @entity44			0
' soldiers of the @entity3 will pass from here soon , ' the note read			1
@entity3 taunted the @entity5 with a photo taken in front of the @entity88 , showing a smartphone displaying the terror group 's flag a verse from the @entity41 followed : ' ... and @entity108 is perfecting his light even though the disbelievers hate [ that ]			1
' @entity112 sen. @entity111 said sunday on @entity16 that the @entity88 should ' assume the worst about these guys			1
they ’re not the jv team anymore , they ’re the most prominent terrorist organization in the world			0
' even more prominent than @entity118 , apparently			0
@entity14 said that the group is ' in a competition now with " @entity118 prime , " the folks along the @entity125 - @entity124 border			1
and there is no way more powerful to express their street credentials among the jihadist community than a successful attack against the @entity35			1
ever since the @entity133 released july 2004 report , observers have pointed to one of the group 's central conclusions as a warning bell for future generations			0
@entity5 , the panelists wrote , suffered from a ' failure to imagine ' the worst calamity a terror group could visit upon a major city			2
' we kind of underestimated our opponents in the past , ' @entity14 agreed on sunday			2
' we certainly did that			0
we lacked imagination with 9/11			0
we kind of did that with @entity150			0
we knew they were up to something			0
we just did n't think it was going to be a @entity154 on an airliner over @entity156			0
' ' well , we 've got the same dynamic here			0
... it is not just about defense			0
it is not just about keeping the right people off of aircraft			0
it 's about disabling @entity3			2
it is about making them more worried , more consumed with protecting their own survivability rather than threatening yours or mine			0
' maybe not : this @entity3 militant , who taunted the @entity5 in a video interview with the vice news website , was killed just weeks later in an @entity5 airstrike @entity177 sen. @entity176 agreed , telling a @entity178 that president @entity179 should go on offense and strike @entity3 in both of the countries where it operates			1
' there is no boundary between @entity184 and @entity185 , ' @entity176 said			1
' one of the key decisions the president is going to have to make is airpower in @entity184			2
we can not give them a base of operations			0
' @entity176 hinted that not even the recent videotaped beheading of @entity5 photojournalist @entity193 would likely be enough to jolt the @entity88 into action , despite nearly 100 airstrikes targeted at @entity3 strongholds			1
' this is an administration which – the kindest word i can use is " feckless " , ' he said , ' where they have not outlined a role that the @entity5 has to play			1
and that is a leadership role			0
' ' no more " leading from behind , " he demanded			2
' no more " do n't do stupid stuff "			0

@entity14 told @entity16 that @entity3 is *itching* to establish its ' street credentials ' among global jihadis
having @entity5 and @entity21 in their ranks , along with competition for followers with @entity214 , indicates that @entity3 will strike the @entity35
@entity56 chairman rep. @entity55 warned that @entity3 is ' one plane ticket away from @entity5 shores '
' no more " leading from behind " , ' demanded sen. @entity176 , *insisting* that the ' feckless ' @entity179 @entity88 must strike @entity3 in both @entity185 and @entity184
