by @entity0 published : 18:14 est , 28 november 2013 updated : 18:16 est , 28 november 2013 when veteran television presenter @entity4 ’s friends discovered he had been mugged during a trip to @entity6 , many of them were no doubt anxious to help him out			1
after all – as a rather alarming email had informed them – he would be trapped abroad until he found £ 1,950 to settle his hotel bill			1
but if any kind - hearted souls were moved to answer mr @entity4 ’s desperate plea for funds , then that was very likely to have been the last they ever saw of their money			1
the 75 - year - old former @entity17 contestant appears to have become the latest victim of an internet ‘ phishing ’ scam – which sees fraudsters hack into people ’s email accounts and beg their contacts for emergency aid			1
friends received a desperate plea for money from @entity4 ( pictured with his daughter , @entity30 ) mr @entity4 ’s friends received an impassioned message from his personal email account on monday			1
entitled ‘ @entity35 ’ , the missive explained that he had fallen victim to foreign thieves			2
it said : ‘ i made a trip to @entity40 , @entity6 and had my bag stolen from me with my passport and personal effects therein			2
‘ the embassy has just issued me a temporary passport but i have to pay for a ticket and settle my hotel bills with the manager			1
’ describing his friends as his ‘ last resort and hope ’ , mr @entity4 – or rather his impersonator – continued : ‘ i have made contact with my bank but it would take me three to five working days to access funds in my account			1
‘ the bad news is my flight will be leaving very soon but i am having problems settling the hotel bills and the hotel manager wo n’t let me leave until i settle the bills			2
’ the message went on to say : ‘ i need your help financially ( £ 1,950 ) and i promise to make the refund once i get back home			1
’ yesterday , internet security experts described the email as a classic online con - trick , known in the industry as a ‘ stranded traveller scam ’			1
the 75 - year - old former @entity17 contestant appears to have become the latest victim of an internet ' phishing ' scam professor @entity76 , director of the @entity77 at @entity78 , said : ‘ this particular scam has been going for quite a while now , at least 12 months , and seems to be increasingly popular			1
‘ it varies depending on which email you get , but is always along similar lines			0
you get an email from a friend saying they have been robbed abroad , and they need money			2
if you email it , you will get a response telling you where to transfer the funds			0
’ he added : ‘ there is a community of scammers online who share the most effective email templates			0
‘ they operate from all over the world , although many certainly seem to be based in @entity102			0
‘ sadly , the scam is surprisingly effective			2
we are used to looking out for dodgy emails pretending to be from your bank , but not from people we know and trust			0
’ another expert advised mr @entity4 – who is the father of dj @entity111 and used to present shows such as @entity113 and @entity114 – to avoid future attacks by updating his computer ’s anti-virus software			1
@entity118 , ceo of internet safety group @entity120 , said : ‘ he needs to make sure all his systems are up to date			2
‘ this almost certainly originated from a virus downloaded when he clicked on a website or email			0
‘ the virus can then read all your email contacts and message them all automatically			0
these scammers have no morals			0
they deliberately play on your heartstrings			0
‘ mr @entity4 ’s friends may think it is a plausible story , as he is a well - travelled man			1
it is easy to imagine someone you know lost in a foreign country			0
with the added sense of urgency , you are even more likely to respond			0
’ he added : ‘ if nobody replied to these emails , they would n’t get sent			0
but unfortunately they catch people out all the time			0
’ internet security experts described the email as a classic con - trick , known as a ' stranded traveller scam '			2

friends informed he would be trapped until he found £ 1,950 to pay hotel bill
if any answered mr @entity4 *'s* plea , they would be unlikely to see money again
mr @entity4 , 75 , appears to be the latest victim of internet ' phishing ' scam
