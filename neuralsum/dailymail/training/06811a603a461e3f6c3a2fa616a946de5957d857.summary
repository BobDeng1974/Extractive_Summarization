by @entity0 , @entity1 published : 09:19 est , 21 january 2014 updated : 11:37 est , 21 january 2014 satisfaction among @entity5 ’s train passengers has plummeted as fares soar , more trains run late and thousands face standing room only on overcrowded trains , damning new figures reveal today			2
the official national rail passenger satisfaction survey for @entity13 says satisfaction levels are ‘ significantly down ’ on the same period last year			1
among individual train companies over the last 12 months it concluded : ‘ none significantly improved and seven declined			2
’ on the worst commuter routes only just over a quarter ( 28 per cent ) think they get value for money from their price of their ticket – with the rest feeling ripped off			1
packed : satisfaction among @entity5 ¿ s train passengers has plummeted as fares soar , trains run late and carriages are overcrowded , according to a new study around one in five passengers are dissatisfied with the quality of service they get from train companies with overall satisfaction levels dropping to 83 per cent – down 2 percentage points compared to @entity13			1
nationally , after years of fare price hikes fewer than half ( 45 per cent ) of passengers are satisfied with the ‘ value for money ’ of their train ticket			2
this is two percentage points lower than in @entity13 ( 47 per cent )			0
but fewer than a third ( 32 per cent ) of passengers on commuter routes feel they get value for money			1
offering worst value for money by train operator is @entity49 with only a third ( 34 per cent ) satisfied with their deal			1
it is followed by @entity56 ( 36 per cent ) , and @entity58 @entity57 ( both 37 per cent )			0
but it is passengers on the @entity62 route who feel most ripped off – with just 28 per cent saying they get value for money from their ticket , just ahead of those on the @entity56 mainline route ( 29 per cent )			1
on overcrowding only two thirds ( 66 per cent ) are satisfied with the amount of sitting or standing space on their train , down by three percentage points on the same period last year			0
nor are passengers impressed with declining punctuality and reliability with satisfaction levels again ‘ significantly down ’ with more than one in five dissatisfied			1
the proportion who are satisfied has fallen by four percentage points to just 79 per cent			0
poor : train operator @entity82 received the lowest rating for overall satisfaction with 76 per cent of passengers saying they were satisfied with the service the worst performer was @entity88 which ties with @entity90 and @entity91 with just 73 per cent of passengers satisfied , followed by @entity57 and @entity93			1
a @entity95 spokesman said : ‘ satisfaction levels on punctuality reflect the reality			1
as punctuality has got worse satisfaction levels have also dropped			1
’ but the figures from independent consumer watchdog @entity95 also show big variations between different rail operators			2
lowest rating for overall satisfaction were given to @entity88 ( 76 per cent ) , @entity106 ( 78 per cent ) , @entity57 ( 79 per cent ) , @entity93 ( 80 per cent ) and @entity56 ( 80 per cent )			1
highest ratings were achieved by @entity108 ( 96 per cent ) , @entity109 ( 95 per cent ) and @entity110 ( 93 per cent )			0
frustration : around one in five passengers are dissatisfied with the quality of service they get from train companies with overall satisfaction levels dropping to 83 per cent overcrowded : only two thirds are satisfied with the amount of sitting or standing space on their train , down by three percentage points on the same period last year dissatisfaction was among its highest on commuter routes in @entity124 and the @entity125			1
here the report notes : ‘ the two biggest declines in satisfaction were with punctuality / reliability ( down 5 per cent ) and how well train companies dealt with delays ( down 5 per cent )			2
among long - distance operators satisfaction at dealing with delays was down by 7 percentage points			2
@entity95 acting chief executive @entity136 said : ‘ there are gaps of around 20 per cent between the best and worst - performing services , and satisfaction with value for money varied from 28 to 82 per cent			1
’ he noted : ’ although generally satisfaction has remained fairly high over the last five years , we want to see a more consistently high level of service for passengers , wherever they may be travelling to and from			2
’ delayed : the @entity95 report said punctuality was a key factor in rail passenger satisfaction out of pocket : fewer than a third of passengers on commuter routes feel they get value for money the @entity95 report says : ‘ the key factor in rail passenger satisfaction remains punctuality			1
the satisfaction rating has dropped since the last @entity13 survey – from 83 to 79 per cent – reflecting a drop in actual punctuality over this period			1
however , passenger punctuality ratings have barely changed in the last five years			2
in 2008 it was 81 per cent			0
’ the report adds : ‘ how train operators handled delays dropped from last year ’s 44 to 40 per cent satisfaction – and varied between 23 and 69 per cent across the country			0
although this is a slight improvement on the situation in 2008 ( when this factor scored 37 per cent ) , it is disappointing considering the amount of work that has gone into helping operators better manage and communicate during delays			0
' the survey was carried out between september and november 2013 , before announcements on rail fare increases which @entity95 predicts will have some impact on the next survey results			1
under the new and capped price - rise formula average regulated fares may increase by up to 3.1 per cent			0
but train companies can also use a 2.0 per flexibility or ‘ flex ’ regulation which lets them put some regulated fares up by 5.1per cent provided their overall average does not exceed the 3.1 per cent cap			0
each january increase is calculated from the @entity193 rate of inflation figure for the previous july , which in 2013 was 3.1 per cent			0
the increase could have been even greater , but chancellor @entity196 announced in his @entity197 in early december that , to ease some of the pain , planned price cap price cap of @entity193 inflation plus 1per cent was being changed to @entity193 plus 0per cent - or in line with inflation only			0
rises on unregulated fares , typically off - peak leisure tickets , are not capped			0
but some of these fares , including on the @entity209 route , are going up by much less than 3.1 per cent			0
the overall rise in tickets - regulated and unregulated – is 2.8 per cent			0
but campaign groups complain that fares are still rising three times faster than wages and want a change to a ‘ fairer ’ model .			0

rail passenger survey shows satisfaction levels ' significantly down '
on worst commuter routes only a quarter feel they get value for money
@entity82 receives lowest score for overall satisfaction
