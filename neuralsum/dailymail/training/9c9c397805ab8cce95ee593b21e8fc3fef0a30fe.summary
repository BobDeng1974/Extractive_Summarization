transferring data onto your computer could soon be a simple as using a post-it note			0
scientists have invented data storage devices that look like the sticky labels , and transfer files simply by being stuck onto the front of a computer , or other device			0
the tiny , paper - thin drives called @entity12 are stacked one on top of another , like real post-it notes , and are then peeled off as and when they 're needed			1
the paper - thin @entity12 , pictured , were created by designer @entity18 and university professor @entity19 , both from @entity20 , @entity21			1
they are built using from a super-strong , conductive material called graphene - made from a layer of carbon atoms - and will be available in sizes up to @entity27 the tiny , paper - thin drives called @entity12 are stacked one on top of another , like real post-it notes , and are then peeled off as and when they 're needed			1
the user then sticks them to the front of their computer , tv , smartphone or tablet to transfer data via a special adhesive			0
datastickies are made from graphene - a super-strong , conductive material made of a single layer of carbon atoms - and will be sold in a range of different sizes up to @entity27			1
the special adhesive used to stick the devices together , and to electronic devices , is conductive			2
it is a ' special low - tack , pressure - sensitive adhesive ' capable of being reused without leaving marks like a stick note , explained the designers			0

the technology is still being developed , but its hoped they will one day replace popular usb drives			0
@entity12 ' design was the brainchild of designer @entity18 and university professor @entity19 , both from @entity20 , @entity21			1
@entity18 said : ' @entity12 are a design concept for graphene - based flash drives that may replace usb data drives in the future			1
' usb - based drives can be inconvenient to use as the positioning and insertion of the drive in the usb slot needs to be done precisely			2
' when the slots are at the rear of a device , as is the case for many desktop computers , this task becomes even more troublesome			0

it is a ' special low - tack , pressure - sensitive adhesive ' capable of being reused without leaving marks like a repositionable note , explained the designers ' @entity12 are envisaged to solve this problem by carrying data like a stack of sticky - back notes			1

@entity12 will be sold in a variety of colours and patterns based on type and size			1
they can also be stacked and used together for increased capacity			0
the top surface can be written on , and if a file needs to be given to someone , a single sticky can be handed out rather than an entire pen drive			0
' @entity12 are not easily lost because they can be stuck down on any object ' , continued the designers			2
' they also provide an opportunity to bridge the virtual world and the physical world			0
digital data becomes easier to associate with , as it can be integrated with the physical objects it relates to			0
' graphene as a material is revolutionary and is touted as the next big thing that will change the way a number of things work , but it will still take maybe a couple of years to commercialise			2
' we are also looking at developing auxiliary products and application for @entity12 keeping the basic idea of humanising technology and bridging its gap with the real world as our focus			2
' the top surface of the @entity12 , pictured , can be written on , and if a file needs to be given to someone , a single sticky can be handed out rather than an entire pen drive			2

paper - thin drives are stacked together and peeled off as and when needed
made from graphene , the drives will be sold in sizes up to @entity27
graphene is a strong , conductive material made from carbon atoms
