by @entity0 published : 10:03 est , 26 april 2013 updated : 18:38 est , 26 april 2013 @entity1 , pictured today , is determined to push the policy through @entity1 could publish plans to introduce a tax break for married couples as early as november , according to senior @entity7 sources			2
the prime minister yesterday confirmed that he would definitely recognise marriage in the tax system before the general election in 2015			1
and a senior figure insisted mr @entity1 is prepared to overrule chancellor @entity13 , who has repeatedly blocked the early introduction of the measure as many @entity17 mps would like			2
‘ the prime minister is the @entity22 , ’ the senior figure said , pointing out that mr @entity1 is in ultimate charge of tax measures			1
a no 10 official said the measure would be introduced in either an autumn statement or a budget , meaning the pledge could be fulfilled when the chancellor makes his next announcement in november			0
a pledge to recognise marriage in the tax system was included in the @entity33 agreement three years ago but mr @entity13 has refused to include it in any of his budgets or autumn statements since			1
mr @entity1 was asked during a local election campaign drive in @entity38 yesterday if he still intends to go ahead with his plans for the measure			0
he said : ‘ yes i do , we set them out at the last election in the conservative manifesto			0
' the @entity33 agreement specifically said that while the @entity46 do n’t agree with them they would abstain if we promoted them and that ’s exactly what we ’ll do before the end of this @entity51			0
’ asked if it will be this year he added : ‘ it will be before the end of this @entity51			0
’ chancellor @entity13 and deputy pm @entity56 are both thought to be against using the tax system to recognise marriage but the @entity60 website reported yesterday that ‘ on tax breaks for marriage , there are signals that the policy will be implemented , perhaps as early as the autumn ’			1
@entity17 @entity16 and cabinet ministers including @entity67 have urged mr @entity1 to introduce the measure no later than this year in order to reinforce the government ’s pledge to be the most family friendly ever , rather than leaving it until 2015			0
many believe it would placate @entity17 voters offended by the introduction of gay marriage , and stay - at - home mothers who will not benefit from new state support with childcare bills			1
the decision to float the idea again now will be seen as an attempt to appeal to traditional voters ahead of the local elections on thursday			0
the @entity87 are expected to lose 300 or more council seats , placing further strain on mr @entity1 ’s relations with his party			0
eligible couples could be up to £ 150 better off from a tax break for people who tie the knot but one person does not work the prime minister has a problem because when the 35 @entity99 councils up for grabs were last fought over in 2009 , it marked a high watermark for @entity17 fortunes and the party won 30 councils outright , picking up 1,531 seats			1
this time , @entity106 is widely predicted to gain several hundred seats , while the @entity46 will join the @entity87 in losing seats			0
the exact details of the marriage tax plan have not been spelt out but it is assumed that the tax change would mirror plans unveiled by the @entity87 before the 2010 general election			2
the conservative manifesto proposed a transferable tax allowance that would apply to all married couples – and gay couples in civil partnerships – who pay the basic rate of income tax			2
spouses not using all of their tax - free personal allowance , either because they stay at home or work part - time and earn less than the threshold for basic rate income tax , were to be able to transfer £ 750 of their benefit to their working partner			1
eligible couples where one partner is not using all the tax - free personal allowance and the other earns up to £ 44,000 would be up to £ 150 a year better off .			1

prime minister wants to recognise marriage in the tax system
both @entity13 and @entity56 are against the idea
allowing stay - at - home spouse to transfer allowance save £ 150 - a - year
