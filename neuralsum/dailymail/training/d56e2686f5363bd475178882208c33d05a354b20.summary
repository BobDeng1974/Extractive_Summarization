this poor little pooch proves she is up for the battle as she practices to walk using splints			0
nine - week old @entity4 , who is a @entity5 , or @entity6 for short , was born with problems that affected her back legs			1
because her limbs folded inwards when she walked which meant she dragged her feet , she has been wearing splints on her legs and already , as this video shows , she is coming on leaps and bounds			1
@entity16 is coming to terms with her problems with her back legs , but remains a confident puppy she can run around with the best of them as she 's adapting to life wearing the splints			1
@entity16 needs a home with someone who has patience to help her build her strength in her legs			1
she has trouble getting up and down steps			0
the cute dog 's tail never stops wagging as you can see			2
as well as meeting her walking challenges head on , she is developing well with her in - house training at such a young age			2
the nine - week old puppy was born with her back legs folding inwards despite her struggles , @entity16 has been described as ' just the happiest puppy ' by the rescue centre a home with someone who can be around regularly during the day would be ideal for @entity16 the good news is , if your heart has melted after watching the video , that @entity16 is on the lookout for a new home			1
@entity51 , who runs @entity52 , told @entity53 : ' she has got feeling in her legs , but she just does n't have the strength in her muscles at the moment			0
' hopefully as she gets older she will develop these and become much stronger			0
' she is just the happiest puppy ; she is n't in any discomfort at all , and it 's great to see her walking			0
it is hoped that as she gets older , the muscles in her back legs can develop and grow stronger ' she loves children , she loves other smaller dogs , so these would be things we would like to consider when finding her a new home			1
and she obviously would need someone who can be around a bit in case she gets into difficulties			0
