@entity0 and @entity1 almost came to blows in an explosive training ground bust - up that hastened the @entity5 ’s shock departure from @entity6			1
@entity7 can reveal the real story behind @entity0 quitting his post as @entity11 ’s assistant a fortnight ago , after just six months in the job			1
he had festering disputes and disintegrating relations with key @entity6 players			2
morale around the club ’s @entity18 training ground had sunk so low that news of his exit was welcomed by the majority of the squad			0
a source said : ‘ the atmosphere was horrible			0
it went downhill the moment @entity0 arrived			2
he p * * * * d off all the big names he should n’t have p * * * * d off and his relationship with the senior players slowly fell apart			1
when he went there was just a feeling of euphoria and relief			0
’ months of simmering tension came to a head when @entity0 clashed spectacularly with stand - in skipper @entity1 in front of stunned team - mates in training days before the @entity5 assistant ’s departure was confirmed			1
it is understood the long - serving @entity6 star was talking tactics with @entity11 when @entity0 interrupted			1
@entity1 resented the interference and tried to belittle @entity0 by telling him : ‘ excuse me , but i ’m talking to the boss ! ’ the two men then became involved in a heated row and had to be separated			1
the ill feeling continued after the training session and @entity11 held talks with @entity0 in the afternoon when it was decided they would part ways			1
@entity1 ( left ) and @entity0 had an explosive argument in the build - up to his resignation this was the last in a series of flashpoints which resulted in @entity0 alienating himself from the players			1
they began soon after his arrival in july when @entity74 objected to criticism from the former @entity77 captain in training and rounded on him in front of the rest of the @entity81			1
the @entity83 midfielder , who is said to have taken an instant dislike to @entity0 , screamed : ‘ do n’t try to f * * * * * * mug me off			1
’ their relationship never recovered			0
the 43 - year - old hardly endeared himself to his new squad after a 1 - 0 home defeat by @entity91 in the @entity92 in august when he berated the players in the dressing room afterwards , and told them : ‘ if i gave you 10 grand , you could n’t even score in a brothel ! ’ @entity0 is also understood to have laid into the team when @entity11 kept them in the dressing room for an hour after a 2 - 0 defeat at @entity102 in october			1
defender @entity103 is another of the players said to have had a falling out with the brooding @entity5 , who became exasperated with the relaxed attitude to training by some other players , including @entity108			2
@entity74 's ( centre ) relationship with @entity0 never recovered after a training ground bust - up in july and @entity0 was also exasperated with the attitude of @entity113 ( centre ) in training ‘ it was a combination of row after row and none of them were in private , ’ our source told @entity7			1
‘ the problem with @entity0 is that he demands the same standards that he was used to at @entity77 and the lads at @entity6 do n’t get paid enough to put up with that kind of c * * p. he just got everybody down			1
’ the obsessively punctual @entity0 would leave his @entity129 home at 6am to be at @entity18 in time for training , and there were players at @entity6 who liked his attitude as well as his training methods			1
however , the atmosphere was so poisonous by the end that few were sad to see him go			0
relieved players exchanged texts when they were informed ahead of the official announcement on november 28 , and the mood on the team bus to @entity143 the next day was said to be significantly better than in previous weeks			0
@entity6 strongly deny @entity0 left the club due to disagreements with players , or that @entity1 was involved in any row			1
@entity0 's ( right ) departure was allegedly welcomed by @entity6 players ahead of their game at @entity143 last month the official reason given for @entity0 ’s departure is that he was finding it difficult combining his work at @entity6 with his job as assistant manager with the @entity156			1
that has been met with widespread scepticism , however , considering that @entity159 do not have another game until march			0
it also seems odd that @entity0 left a day before the game at @entity143 and questions about the matter were strictly prohibited in @entity11 ’s post-match press conference at @entity166			2
the @entity6 players have also been sworn to secrecy over the real reason behind @entity0 ’s exit , but our revelations today will come as little surprise to those who have followed his controversial career			2
as a player , his fastidiously high standards led to the infamous row with @entity176 in @entity177 over @entity179 ’s training camp for the 2002 @entity180 and @entity0 being sent home from the tournament			2
he departed @entity77 three years later shortly after a similar falling out with sir @entity183 and @entity184 on a pre-season trip to @entity186			0
@entity0 's ( right ) left @entity77 as a player after an argument with @entity184 ( centre ) in 2005 @entity0 ’s friend and former @entity159 team - mate @entity190 , who spent the majority of his career at @entity77 and @entity6 , admits his compatriot struggles to get along with people who do not match those standards			1
@entity190 told @entity7 : ‘ @entity0 says it as he sees it and does n’t have too much interest in respecting big personalities or trying to be nice to people he ca n’t be bothered with			1
‘ if he does n’t agree with you , he will tell you in no uncertain terms and that can rub people up the wrong way			2
‘ he has high standards , good standards , that make those around him better and if you do n’t want to follow them i ’m not sure he has time for you			0
that ’s no bad thing when you consider what he has to offer and what he has achieved			0
’ the intensity of @entity0 ’s management style is laid bare in his splendidly candid autobiography @entity214 , published in october , which includes details of his time in charge of @entity218 and @entity219			2
@entity0 released his controversial second autobiography ' @entity214 ' in october he confirmed that his falling out with @entity218 captain and @entity156 international @entity222 over concerns the player was angling for a move to @entity226 in 2010 involved some ‘ effing and blinding , a bit of shoving ’			2
the two men have made up since @entity0 took over as no 2 to @entity159 manager @entity229 , but it ’s understood the row was so heated at the time that @entity222 warned @entity0 that he knew where he lived			1
the @entity218 boss then grabbed a pen and paper and handed the player his address just in case			0
it came to a head after @entity222 withdrew from a @entity92 tie against @entity242 in 2010 due to a stomach bug , and @entity0 demanded the player provide @entity218 ’s medical staff with evidence			0
‘ i sent the physio a photo of my sick , ’ recalls @entity222			0
‘ he came round at eight o’clock the next morning with the club doctor and said that he could smell ( on my breath ) that i ’d been sick			0
‘ you never know where you stand with him and that was the fear factor he brought in			0
i respected him as a player , but maybe he ca n’t get his point across as a manager			0
’ @entity226 forward @entity222 has mended his relationship with @entity0 , following their time together at @entity218 in his book , @entity0 admits : ‘ i do n’t think i ’m a bad manager , but at @entity218 i managed badly			1
i spoke to some people like something on the bottom of my shoe			0
’ the combative streak that made @entity0 a great player just did n’t seem to work for @entity0 the manager			1
defender @entity267 — now at @entity268 — describes a pre-season army camp arranged by the manager			0
‘ that was horrendous , ’ says @entity267			0
‘ he took our phones and wallets away from us , saying , “ you ’ve got five minutes to phone home and say you wo n’t be home tonight ”			0
’ at @entity219 , where @entity0 won promotion to the @entity279 in his first season in charge , it was alleged that he slapped his captain @entity282 during the half - time interval of a @entity92 tie against @entity285 in september 2008 after sending the tactics board flying with a kung - fu kick			2
with more time on his hands now , @entity0 was back in his hometown of @entity290 this week signing copies of his autobiography			0
as details of the latest chapter in a controversial career emerge , he is unlikely to be out of the spotlight for long .			0

@entity0 quit as @entity6 assistant manager in november
@entity0 had a heated row with @entity1 in the lead up to his resignation as @entity11 's assistant
feud sparked when @entity1 allegedly tried to belittle @entity0 after @entity306 interrupted his chat with boss @entity11 about tactics
@entity74 told @entity0 once ‘ do n’t try to f * * * * * * mug me off , ’ after being criticised by the @entity5 during a training session in july
