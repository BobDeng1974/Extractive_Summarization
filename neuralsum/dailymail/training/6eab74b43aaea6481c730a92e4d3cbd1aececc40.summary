by @entity0 published : 07:55 est , 24 november 2013 updated : 09:49 est , 24 november 2013 cheesy and proud : the @entity3 leader happily picked sing - a - long anthems to soundtrack his desert island as he said himself , no one ever accused @entity7 of being cool			1
and after his appearance on @entity10 this morning , that 's not going to change any time soon			2
unveiling his favourite eight tracks of all time , the @entity3 leader named @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 in a pop - heavy playlist			1
it is a far cry from his political rival , prime minister @entity18 , who used his chance as a castaway to name - drop indie hits and student favourites by @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25			1
he rebuked a suggestion by @entity27 , presenter of the @entity29 show , that politicians use the list to boost their image			2
asked how many advisers had looked at the list beforehand , mr @entity7 , 43 , said : ' it 's absolutely my list			2
it 's a list that is personal to me - some people will not like some of the songs and that 's as it should be - but this is a list i chose			1
' he opted for stirring tunes such as the @entity48 national anthem and @entity49 and a personal tribute to his father with the left - wing anthem @entity54 of @entity55			0
to complete the collection , he requested sing - a - long anthems take on me by @entity13 and @entity59 by @entity14			0
he also reserved a spot on his island for @entity62 by @entity63 , famously sung by former chancellor @entity64 in 1993 at a press conference when asked what he regretted most : singing in the bath after @entity68 , or promising ' green shoots ' of recovery			0
his desert island luxury was a regular chicken tikka curry takeaway and his book was @entity74 ' @entity75			0
@entity76 : @entity7 named anthems by @entity14 ( left ) and @entity13 singer @entity78 ( right ) in his interview , mr @entity7 admitted his relationship with brother @entity18 has still not fully ‘ healed ’ following his decision to stand against him for the @entity3 leadership			1
he said their 2010 leadership battle was ‘ really , really tough ’ on those close to him and that he had ‘ possibly underestimated ’ the emotional impact his decision to stand would have on his family			0
the @entity3 leader , who is not religious , also described about the moment he prayed to @entity91 to save his dying father			2
mr @entity7 , 43 , still regards older brother @entity18 as his ‘ best friend ’ but says their relationship is ‘ healing ’ rather than healed			1
‘ it has been incredibly tough			0
i did n’t take this decision lightly			0
healing : he opened up about his troubled relationship with brother @entity101 ( right ) pictured here in 2010 ‘ i knew it would have an impact on my family , on him ... it was hard for my family			0
it was hard for @entity18			1
but i suppose i felt that it was the right thing , ’ he said			0
mr @entity7 adds that he and his brother avoided confronting each other about their rival ambitions before the leadership contest , adding : ‘ we probably danced around it a bit because neither of us particularly was desperate to confront it			0
’ today 's list is a change from the one he compiled for @entity121 in the run up to the party leadership election in 2010 , when he picked an @entity124 for his luxury and the more high - brow @entity126 as his book			1
although @entity14 , @entity13 and @entity54 of @entity55 appeared on his 2010 list , he has made some revisions			2
cool list : as leader of the opposition , @entity18 requested student favourites such as @entity23 eclectic : his coalition partner @entity134 put @entity136 alongside @entity137 and @entity138 in his 2010 interview @entity141 's song good man has been replaced by his other track change of @entity143			1
two 1980s hits - @entity145 's song @entity144 and @entity146 by the @entity147 - have gone , replaced by @entity49 and the @entity48 national anthem			0
and he now prefers @entity15 to early - 2000s indie band @entity150			2
his brother and competitor , @entity18 , also shunned current music in favour of @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity157			1
by way of contrast , mr @entity18 - who was at the time heading the opposition when he appeared on the @entity29 show in 2006 - packed his selections with tunes which made him look as though he was seeking the cool vote			1
he included @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity168 's comedy hit @entity169 as a novelty extra			2
but his cool list was chided by the bands themselves			2
@entity174 and the @entity176 's guitarist @entity175 both spoke out to inform the then - leader of the opposition that they would rather not count him as a fan			1
@entity134 , who appeared on the show in 2010 , had something of an eclectic selection , featuring @entity23 and @entity138 alongside 80s pop classic prince and @entity136 's @entity186 anthem @entity184			1
@entity48 national anthem ( @entity188 ) 2			0
