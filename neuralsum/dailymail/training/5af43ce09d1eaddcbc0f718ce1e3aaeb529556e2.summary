by @entity1 reporter published : 16:34 est , 23 august 2013 updated : 17:09 est , 23 august 2013 the father of a @entity4 girl who committed suicide after she was gang - raped and then viciously cyber-bullied has received death threats warning that if he does n't ' shut up ' he 'll ' join his daughter			1
' since @entity10 , 17 , killed herself in april , her father , @entity8 , has been a vocal advocate against cyberbullying and has demanded justice in the horrific case , in which two teens are facing porn - related charges			1
but he said he has now received a sinister message posted on his @entity19 account demanding he ' shut up ' or his life may be at risk			1
he has alerted police and they have launched an investigation			0
he has now received a death threat ' " i know where you live , i know your face , i know your car , i know your house , i know where you work			2
and you better shut up , bud , or you 're going to be joining your daughter			2
" just stuff like that , ' @entity8 told @entity41 of the threats			1
' it 's pretty sad , actually			2
' he added that he felt threatened enough to call the @entity4 police			1
' i would say i do n't trust them why would i they are capable of doing some pretty sick stuff so whether or not they decide to take a shot at me some day i do n't know , ' he said			0
royal @entity53 police sergeant @entity52 confirmed they had received a complaint from @entity8 but would n't comment further because the investigation is ongoing			1
police can request @entity19 provide them with the person 's information such as the ip address of the computer from where the comment originated			1
in the meantime , @entity8 said he is taking precautions including setting up security cameras around his @entity68 home			1
' victim ' : @entity10 , pictured , was labelled a ' slut ' after she was allegedly gang raped by four teenagers in 2010 protection : the two teenage suspects , now 18 , can not be identified under @entity4 law because they were 16 when the alleged crime took place ' we have cameras set up around our home right now to keep track of things , ' he said			1
' but i think that they 're gutless cowards			0
they 're the kind of people that would show up in the middle of the night and spray paint your house			0
' the threats come just a week after the lawyer for one of the two 18 - year - olds charged with circulating rape pictures of @entity10 is also being persecuted by a ' cyber-lynch mob			1
' @entity10 ' tragic suicide brought international attention to her claims that she was gang - raped when she was 15 and then relentlessly tormented by classmates who called her a ' slut ' and harassed her for sex			1
much of the bullying was a result of a photo the circulated at her school that showed @entity10 being assaulted by a teen boy while throwing up out a window			1
the two 18 - year - olds are charged with child pornography			2
one is accused of taking the picture , both are accused of circulating it			1
because the alleged crime took place when the men were 16 , they are charged as juveniles and their identities can not be revealed			2
left behind : her father said she killed herself out of disappointment in her school , her former friends and law enforcement officers who failed to help her they were both in court on august 15 with their parents for a brief appearance			2
the judge set a trial for september 19			0
@entity132 , the attorney for one of the men , told @entity135 that his client has already been convicted in the court of public opinion			2
' the internet mavens and some members of the media have acted like a lynch mob in relation to this matter			0
they 've tried and convicted this person without any due process whatsoever , ' he said			0
@entity10 's heartbroken parents say that she hanged herself in their bathroom two years after the alleged attack because she could not bear to bullying and torment at school			1
her uncle was furious about the attorney 's allegations			2
' this man 's saying that these boys have been prosecuted in the @entity158 has n't been the case			2
that 's not true , ' @entity160 said			2
' this case has been brought forward in the media			0
because , it was only through the media participation that this case is even being looked at today			0
' he also said he is praying for the two accused			0
protesters : a handful of protestors turned out to the courthouse where the suspects in the @entity10 case were due to appear on august 15 ' i have to pray for these boys			1
i have to pray for them to become good men			0
that 's the hardest thing for me to do			0
but it 's something i have to do			0
that 's what 's hard			0
if you want to know the truth that 's the hardest thing to do , ' he told the @entity41			2
' i have absolutely no faith in the @entity187 or the @entity189 city police or the crown prosecutors because they totally dropped this case , they totally dropped the ball			0
' @entity10 's death led to an outcry because no one was charged or even reprimanded at the school - either for her rape or for the bullying			1
four boys , aged 14 , 17 and two aged 16 , allegedly took it in turns to sexually assault her on november 12 , 2011 , after plying her with alcohol , she told her mother days after			1

police initially concluded there were no grounds to charge anyone after a year - long investigation			0
@entity187 corporal @entity218 said they arrested two males			0
tragedy : @entity10 , 17 , took her life in april after enduring months of bullying after an alleged gang rape innocence : @entity10 is pictured as a baby with her parents , @entity228 and @entity8 ' due to the sensitive nature around this investigation , the investigators do want to ensure that no court process is affected , ' @entity218 said			1
the arrests came after someone came forward in april and provided new information and said they were willing to verify who the suspects are			0
' we 're just hopeful there 's charges laid and others to arrest , hoping that they 're finally willing to tell their side of the story , ' @entity228 , @entity10 's mother , said			1
' a sense of relief came over me that at least they 're going to be questioned			0
' last month @entity228 and her husband spoke to @entity251 about their daughter 's tragic death			1
' when @entity10 was born , i promised her the world			2
now my beautiful girl is gone , ' @entity228 said			0
she started smoking pot to ' numb her emotions ' and deal with @entity260 messages and texts that came through by the dozen			0
they read things like : ' sluts are not welcome here ' and ' everyone knew exactly what you have done '			0
distraught : @entity10 's mother chokes back tears at the teenager 's funeral in april after she hanged herself ' no help ' : @entity277 staff failed to speak to the boys involved and @entity10 left @entity10 eventually closed down her @entity260 page because there were so many men asking her to have sex with them			1
they would say : ‘ you had sex with my friend , so why not me ? ’ the response from the school was , apparently , to do very little			0
@entity189 school board spokesman @entity288 has said that none of the boys were spoken to			0
her father , @entity8 , told people earlier : ' my daughter was n't bullied to death , she was disappointed to death			1
disappointed in people she thought she could trust , her school , and the police			0
' @entity10 's death prompted the @entity68 government to launch reviews of the @entity187 's original investigation and the school board 's handling of the matter			1
an independent review released in june concluded the @entity309 could have done a better job , but it was hindered by the fact that @entity10 was often absent from class .			2
