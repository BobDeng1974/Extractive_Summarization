by @entity1 reporter published : 20:33 est , 14 january 2014 updated : 06:18 est , 15 january 2014 when triathlete @entity4 learned she had made the cut for the @entity6 , she turned and winked at her twin sister @entity8			1
after getting sick during the final qualifying races in @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity9 thought her @entity14 dreams were over after she was the final competitor eliminated and assumed her sister was telling her she would race for her in @entity16			1
both biathletes , from @entity18 , have been to the @entity19 before - @entity8 has been to the previous two @entity19 , and @entity4 made the team back in 2006			1
it was only later on a walk in the @entity23 that @entity4 told her what was really happening : she would give up her spot on the team so @entity8 , a three - time olympian who finished just behind her , would qualify for the team and compete in @entity16 instead			1
stand by your sister : @entity4 ( right ) has given up her spot on the @entity6 for the @entity32 to her twin sister @entity8 ( left ) in a beautiful statement that explains her decision , @entity4 said her twin sister @entity8 deserved a second chance after failing to make the @entity19 team			1
@entity4 said her sibling was having a ' stellar season ' before falling ill and that she is honored to be able to help her @entity4 competes in the @entity40 15km @entity39 at the @entity41 in 2006			1
she has stepped down from her place in the current @entity14 team and given it to her twin , @entity8 ' she is my hero and this only shows true selflessness and the @entity14 spirit , ' @entity9 , 32 , of @entity46 said via email from @entity12			1
' this has motivated me even more to not only represent my country but to represent her as well			0
' @entity4 , who barely missed qualifying for the @entity54 , was returning home from @entity12 and could n't be reached for comment			2
in a statement released by the team , @entity4 said her sister had had a stellar season before falling ill and she wanted to give her a second chance			1
' and as the old saying goes ... '' only the strong will survive '' , ' she said in the statement			0
' most of the time , that is the case			0
' on occasion the strong do n't survive for whatever reason			0
and that is what i feel happened to @entity8			2
' she 's having a stellar season and she bound to do great things this year , but she fell ill during the trials and could n't race			2
@entity4 ( left ) watches twin sister @entity9 take aim near @entity78 in @entity18			1
the twins mother says @entity4 is ready for something else in her life ' because of that she did n't make the team			2
while most people would say			0
. '' that 's biathlon , or that 's life '' - and they 'd be absolutely correct in saying that - but what if that person who was hit with a little bit of bad luck got a second chance ? ' what if someone believed in them enough to give them that chance ? well , that 's what i did			0
' @entity8 is my best friend and my teammate			0
' i see how hard she works on a daily basis , so i know firsthand that she is deserving of a spot on the @entity104			0
' the twins ' mother , @entity105 , told the @entity107 that @entity4 's motivation to go to the @entity19 had waned in the last year			2
she is married to @entity110 coach @entity109 , and her mother said they have n't been able to spend much time together because of her heavy travel schedule			0
' @entity4 is just ready for other things , ' @entity105 told the newspaper .			0
