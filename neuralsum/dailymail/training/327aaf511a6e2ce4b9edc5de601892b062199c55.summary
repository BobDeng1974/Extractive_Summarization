by @entity0 for many women , it 's the tell - tale signs of aging around their eyes and their mouth they wish they could banish			2
however , for @entity8 , 58 , from @entity9 , it was wrinkle - free ears she longed for			1
the mother - of - one said damage caused by wearing large earrings when she was younger had left her with older - looking ears			1
before : the wrinkly ear , which affected @entity8 's self - esteem after : her lobe back to its former puffy self after being injected with filler and she was delighted when she found the answer to her problem – eartox			1
the treatment , officially known as ‘ ear rejuvenation ’ , eliminates lines from the earlobes and restores them to their youthful puffy selves			1
@entity8 says : ‘ i felt that my earlobes were old , and i felt very self - conscious about it			1
‘ my ears had lost volume due to the natural aging process and i also had a really strong wrinkle line running vertically down my lobe to the point where my ears had been pierced			2
‘ it was always visible no matter what type of earrings i wore and i could only wear small , light studs , as anything heavier would look like it was dropping out my ear			2
@entity8 , 58 , after her ear treatment ‘ it not only meant i could no longer wear the earrings i loved , it also affected the way i could wear my hair and my confidence			1
’ it was dr @entity53 , a @entity9 - based cosmetic doctor , who offered @entity8 the treatment			1
‘ the lobe is injected with filler in several areas and inflates , but it then looks better immediately , ’ dr @entity55 explains			0
the hydrophilic filler draws fluid into it , which causes further inflation and makes the tissue appear softer and more hydrated			0
' @entity65 ' may seem an odd route to beauty , but @entity8 says : ' we all have our thing			1
' and she could n’t be happier with her new voluminous lobes			0
‘ the procedure was painless and very comfortable , there were no after - effects , no pain or swelling , ' she says			2
‘ i ’m not sure anyone else will notice i ’ve had it had done , but it affected my self - esteem and i now feel like my whole face is the same age			0
‘ i can also wear my hair up and feel confident that i have younger looking , rejuvenated earlobes			2
and i can wear fabulous earrings again			0
‘ i ’ve always loved accessorising outfits			0
i even used to buy the earrings first and then find an outfit to match			0
‘ in the @entity88 and @entity89 i wore the massive , heavy earring , which were fashionable at the time			0
little did i realise the consequences decades later			0

@entity8 , 58 , felt *paranoid* about wrinkly ears
opted for ear rejuvenation treatment to get rid of lines
mother - of - one says she now feels younger and more confident
