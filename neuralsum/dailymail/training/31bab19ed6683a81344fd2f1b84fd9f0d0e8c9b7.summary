by @entity0 ten years ago , @entity1 was in the middle of a decade of gang violence during which 112 people across the city died as a result of gun crime			1
this september , the city that earned itself the nickname ' @entity8 ' hopes to celebrate two years without a fatal shooting - a two - year lull since the shocking murders of two policewomen by gangster @entity14			1
today police showed off some of the terrifying cache of guns seized or surrendered in the city in the last two years as they advertised a new gun amnesty in @entity1 beginning tomorrow			1
looking more appropriate to a @entity20 battlefield than the streets of @entity22 , @entity24 's array includes a grenade launcher , an assault rifle , an @entity28 , a light machine gun , sub-machine gun and am array of revolvers and automatic pistols			2
between 1999 and 2009 , 112 people were shot dead in @entity1 , but there has n't been one fatal shooting there since @entity49 and @entity49 were shot by one - eyed @entity14 in september 2012			1
and there has n't been a fatal gang - related shotting since may 2009 , when 16 - year old schoolboy @entity53 was shot dead by a 15 - year old hitman whilst sitting the back of a car in a pub car park in @entity58			1
detective chief inspector @entity59 , from the elite @entity60 which was formed in 2005 to tackle the gangs said gun crime had fallen in the city year - on - year since the last amnesty in 2008			1
she said : ' the last fatal gang shooting was @entity66 , and the last fatal non-gang shootings were the tragic circumstances surrounding @entity49 and @entity49 in 2012			2
' these deaths , although not recent , are still far too many			0
we therefore want as many weapons as possible and would encourage people to hand them in			0
' this @entity74 semi-automatic pistol was seized by anti-gun crime officers in @entity1 @entity14 , 31 , left , was jailed for life after @entity1 's most recent fatal shooting in september 2012 ; right is a @entity78 , one of a horde of illegal firearms seized by and soon to be melted down by police in @entity1 out of action : this orange @entity85 pistol is one of many that will be melted down by police @entity66 's father , @entity87 , 42 , now an anti-gun campaigner said : ' i hope this gun amnesty makes a massive difference			1
' a lot of children get hold of guns because of their vulnerability - if they are growing up in a house where there is no money or too many other children it can have a grave consequence if there is no father figure			0
' that child whose mother is working two or three jobs is not always there to keep an eye on him and if the mum is n't there to keep an eye on him then the streets will keep an eye on him			0
' he added : ' it 's easier for people to join a gang than to leave , and youngsters need an exit strategy to get out of that			0
' to a person involved in weapons and guns it can only end two ways : jail or death			0
' most recent gun crime victims : policewomen @entity49 , 42 , and @entity49 , 23 , died in september 2012 notorious murders during the height of @entity1 's gun problems included the shooting of 15 - year - old @entity132 , who was shot and killed on 9 september 2006 as he cycled home from a party with friends			1
in one incident in 2004 panic broke out at @entity138 as rival armed gangs spotted each other after a shooting and ran after each other through the hospital corridors			0
but police cracked down on the gangs , and in 2001 @entity145 , then 28 - year - old leader of the @entity146 , was given 30 years for murder , and in 2009 @entity148 , then 29 , and 32 - year old @entity149 were given 35 years for two murders after being convicted of running the @entity151			2
@entity152 , then 42 , and leader of the @entity154 was jailed for 21 years in 2007 for organised a botched hit which saw both his hitmen shot dead			0
the amnesty begins at 7am tomorrow and will give people the chance to dispose of firearms or ammunition with no questions asked by handing it in at any @entity24 police station			2
they will not face prosecution for illegal possession , and can remain anonymous .			0
