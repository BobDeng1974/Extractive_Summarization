the average person who uses social media has romantic or sexual conversations with two people other than their current partner			1
these results from a new @entity7 study ( @entity8 ) echo many others : that ' remote infidelity ' - loving or sexual interaction that does n't involve physical contact - is on the rise			2
but the jury divides sharply on the effect this will have on our relationships			0
the average person has romantic or sexual conversations on social networks with two people other than their current partner some consider it not just an alarm bell but a loudly clanging church - tower size one - as harmful to the relationship as in - person one - night - stands or affairs			1
others believe this is nothing new , that people in love have always flirted ( usually without intent ) and it 's not cheating if body parts do n't touch			1
they also believe - crucially - that what your partner does n't know , wo n't hurt the relationship			2
surprising ( to the people with the first mindset but not the second ) , the @entity8 research actually found no correlation between people who had saucy or soppy chats with others and their commitment to the relationship			2
which sparks another , rather interesting question			0
regardless of whether cheating is in the flesh or ' remote ' and digital , if your partner does n't know about it , does it really matter ? @entity56 says that if we get away with cheating it can make us judge our partner for being too naïve whether we 're talking about good old - fashioned in - the - flesh infidelity or the online version , if you do n't blab to big - mouthed friends , there 's absolutely no chance you 'd ever get found out , have @entity67 standard passwords on all your accounts , never plan to see them again ( or never have , if it 's digital ) , you had safe sex ( if in person ) and it meant nothing , what harm can cheating really do ? some people ( usually the less faithful type ) say it depends totally on your personality			1
if you genuinely see nothing wrong with what you did and your motivation was solely opportunity , how could cheating possibly harm your relationship ? your partner is none the wiser and your behaviour towards them has n't altered			1
where 's the problem ? well , here 's a few			0
lots of people do get caught - ironically , more so with ' remote ' infidelity than physical because once you 're online there 's a more visible , documented and ( remarkably easy to find ) trace			1
there goes the ' they 'll never find out ' defence			0
but even if you did manage to commit the perfect infidelity crime , very few people truly believe there 's nothing wrong with cheating			1
even the smoothest , slickest serial offender , fond of boasting of their conquests to equally unfaithful friends , is aware they 're doing something wrong			0
and this is where it all unravels			0
knowing we 've done something that would hurt our partner subtly alters our perception of them			0
you got away with something , so you 're one up on them			0
this makes them appear either naïve and too trusting or vulnerable and hopelessly helpless			1
good relationships are based on mutual admiration and respect , not pitying your partner or secretly thinking they 're stupid			0
my conclusion ? i 'm sticking with what i 've always said about infidelity			0
if you want to know if what you 're doing is cheating , ask yourself this question : would my partner be upset if they could see what i 'm doing right now ? if you answer yes , then you 're cheating			2
continue doing what you 're doing after you 've answered yes and you 're effectively saying ' i do n't care about my partner 's feelings '			2
in person or online , let 's not kid ourselves			1
