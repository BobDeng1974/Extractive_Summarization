by @entity0 and @entity1 emergency services were hit by a surge in 999 calls yesterday as the deadly smog tightened its grip on @entity7			1
complaints about breathing problems rocketed and people were urged to avoid strenuous outdoor activity as the fumes enveloped many parts of the country			2
@entity15 , who abandoned his regular morning jog , was criticised for dismissing the potent cocktail of toxic particles , factory pollution and dust from the @entity21 as a ' naturally occurring weather phenomenon '			1
high air pollution levels of level 7 were measured in the capital yesterday scientists said the health crisis was as much to do with his government 's failure to deal with poor air quality			0
as the pollution reached ten , the maximum on the official scale measuring air quality , for a second day : @entity26 and the @entity39 were again among areas worst hit , with the @entity41 reporting a 14 per cent rise in 999 calls related to breathing difficulties			1
ambulance services in the @entity46 and the @entity47 experienced a spike in emergency calls , while the smog also affected the @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53			1
nearly a third of asthmatics suffered an attack as a result of the pollution , a poll for asthma @entity7 found , while 84 per cent reported using their blue reliever inhaler more than usual			1
asthma @entity7 chief executive @entity62 said the smog was having ' a significant impact on the health and quality of life ' of asthmatics and they needed to take urgent action to stay safe			1
protection : @entity71 and her son @entity70 , six , wear masks in @entity73 , @entity74 ( left ) , while birds float on the @entity76 in @entity26 's @entity77 ( right ) poor visibility : heavy smog hits @entity26 for a second day today			1
the @entity80 is just visible through the smog she added : ' asthma can be very serious , it takes the lives of three people every day so we want to do everything we can to help people minimise their risk of a potentially life threatening attack			1
' dr @entity92 of @entity93 said : ' some parts of the country have now recorded very high levels of air pollution and @entity93 is urging people in those areas to reduce physical exertion , particularly outdoors , especially if they experience symptoms such as a cough or sore throat			2
adults and children with lung problems , adults with heart problems , and older people , in areas where high levels are recorded should avoid strenuous physical activity			2
' @entity41 deputy medical director @entity113 said : ' more people are calling us with breathing difficulties , asthma and heart problems			1
' she said the young and healthy are unlikely to suffer serious short - term effects from the pollution but anyone with sore eyes , a tickly cough or a dry throat should see their pharmacist or gp if symptoms persist			0
she warned the smog had made it a busy time for the service and urged people to call only in a genuine emergency			2
in the distance : a view of @entity26 from @entity137 in the north of the capital , as high levels of air pollution are continuing to affect parts of the @entity7 still exercising : a cyclist wears a mask with an air filter as he cycles through @entity77 in @entity26 say cheese : a man takes a photograph of a group at top of @entity137 , with the @entity26 skyline in the background , in @entity154 walking to work : commuters cross @entity157 in the smog this morning , with @entity24 in the background although the smog is forecast to begin to clear today as the wind picks up , experts say the @entity163 may remain under pressure as people suffer delayed symptoms brought on by inhaling the dust			1
@entity168 , head of patient services at the @entity170 , said : ' it would be surprising if we did n't see an overall increase in the number of hospital admissions as a result of the pollution , certainly among people with respiratory condition such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease			0
there is often a slight delay between exposure to pollutants and the onset of breathlessness , coughing and wheezing , so it is also possible that the ill effects of the pollution has yet to take hold in many people			0
' although the @entity21 dust and fumes blown in from @entity196 are part of the problem , scientists insist pollution from @entity7 cars and factories is a major factor			0
dr @entity203 , a meteorologist at the @entity204 , warned : ' toxic gases , such as nitrogen dioxide and ozone , as well as fine dust particles all contribute to cause problems for people with heart , lung and breathing problems , such as asthma			2
' the prime minister told @entity216 : ' it is unpleasant , and you can feel it in the air			0
' i did n't go for my morning run this morning			0
i chose to do some work instead			0
' however , mr @entity15 insisted : ' but it 's a naturally occurring weather phenomenon			1
it sounds extraordinary , @entity21 dust , but that is what it is			0
' @entity26 mayor @entity230 , who has been criticised for failing to deal with @entity26 's poor air quality , told @entity232 : ' i cycled this morning and it seemed perfectly fine to me			1
' i think we need to keep a little bit of a sense of proportion			0
' critics said mr @entity15 's ' flippant remark ' and mr @entity230 's comments demonstrated the government 's failure to get to grips with air pollution , which was linked to the premature deaths of more than 29,000 people in @entity7 last year , according to official figures			2
@entity247 , @entity248 for @entity249 , said mr @entity15 's remark was ' utterly disgraceful '			2
he said : ' in the last ten years nearly 300,000 people have died because of air pollution in the @entity7 , that 's the equivalent of a city the size of @entity256			0
' yet the prime minister has the audacity to lay the entire blame for the smog on @entity261			0
