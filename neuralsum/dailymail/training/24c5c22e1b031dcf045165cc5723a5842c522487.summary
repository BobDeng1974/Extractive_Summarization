in the money : what makes you play ? so what drives people to play the lottery , and what makes them think their $ 1 investment — among the many , many millions — will bring staggering wealth ? ' it 's the same question as to why do people gamble , ' said @entity45 , author of ' @entity46 ' and co-director of the @entity48 in @entity49			2
' it 's a desire to improve your life in a way that 's driven by fantasy ... the bigger the fantasy , the tastier it gets			2
' in a piece called ' @entity59 ! , ' @entity45 and co-author @entity57 wrote on their blog last year on the @entity63 website that in times of economic stress , playing the lottery is a way of coping with financial anxieties and uncertainty			2
' we may seek a magic pill to make us feel better , ' they wrote			2

' if you want something to be true , your brain is awfully good at figuring out reasons , magical ones , that there 's a good likelihood that it is true			0
