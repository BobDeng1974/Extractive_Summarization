career saved : @entity1 won the @entity2 earlier this year after laser eye surgery when @entity1 won the @entity2 earlier this year , it marked an extraordinary comeback			1
although the marksman was only 24 when he clinched the title , he had n’t competed for six years because his deteriorating eyesight had forced him to give up the sport			1
but following successful laser surgery , @entity1 is now back in the game and even hoping to compete in the 2016 olympics in @entity13			1
he suffered from short - sightedness , which occurs when the eyes keep growing and become too long from front to back			1
this means that light does n’t reach the light - sensitive tissue ( retina ) at the back of the eye but focuses too early , so distant objects become blurred			2
‘ when you are shooting , good hand - to - eye co-ordination is essential , ’ explains @entity1			1
‘ and you need excellent sight			2
‘ my father used to shoot and i would watch him			0
when i was six , he let me have a go			0
i swiftly overtook him , and by the age of nine i was shooting competitively			0
’ his early success was quite extraordinary			0
aged 12 , he was in the @entity33 team and also won his first sub-junior world championship in @entity35			2
but the following year , @entity1 ’s vision in his right eye started to deteriorate			1
‘ it was n’t catastrophic , but i had to retrain for six months			0
i had previously shot left - handed , and i changed hands			2
’ however , by the time he reached 16 , his eyesight was even worse			0
he went to an optician and was given glasses to wear – but he hated using them for shooting			0
‘ i found that i got glare from the targets , and i could n’t wear safety glasses over the top , ’ @entity1 says			1
‘ i struggled enough with glasses to know that i could n’t deal with contact lenses			0
what had been effortless became extremely difficult and stopped being fun			0
i later decided that shooting was n’t for me and turned my attention to car racing instead			0
’ his parents were understandably disappointed , and a year ago @entity1 ’s father suggested he have laser eye surgery to rectify the short - sightedness			1
@entity1 was wary about the reported risks – indeed last week spice girl @entity61 revealed she is going blind in her left eye following a procedure 15 years ago , and is now planning to have a cornea transplant to correct her vision			1
but @entity66 , a consultant surgeon at @entity67 in @entity68 , says better techniques and technology means laser surgery is much safer than it was 20 years ago			1
improving : better techniques and technology means laser surgery is much safer than it was 20 years ago ‘ i have many more contact lens wearers turning up in my clinic with serious eye infections than i do laser patients , ’ he says			1
‘ surgery is very safe as along as you have it carried out in the right place with an experienced surgeon			2
’ in march , @entity1 met ophthalmic surgeon @entity84 at the @entity85 in @entity86 , who explained what would happen with a procedure known as @entity90 – laser - assisted - in - situ - keratomileusis eye surgery			1
this uses two computer - guided lasers			2
@entity1 describes the procedure as no worse than having a tooth extracted			1
‘ during the second part all i could see was the orange light of the laser and i could hear a sort of popping sound			0
’ after his successful comeback @entity1 was given a new gun by his sponsors – gun makers @entity105 – and now has his sights set firmly on @entity13			2
‘ i ’m really going for gold			0
i do n’t aim for anything less when i ’m shooting , ’ he says			0
idesign @entity111 treatment is from £ 1,895 per eye , opticalexpress.co.uk			0
