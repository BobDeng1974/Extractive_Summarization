critics had branded the expenditure a waste of money from an institution which has spent much of the 11 years since it became a university near the foot of national league tables			2

mr @entity0 , 42 , was dismissed as a senior lecturer in visual effects for film and television after a 45 - minute disciplinary hearing last friday for ‘ leaking information to the press aimed at damaging the university ’			1
according to his union he was told he had been overheard talking on his mobile phone using the words ‘ boats ’ and ‘ lakes ’ , and accused of being the source of the story that the university was sending its 700 staff to a @entity27 hotel in a series of away days for pep talks by professor @entity24 , who has a yacht moored nearby			1
the article first appeared in @entity79 , which yesterday said neither mr @entity0 nor his wife were the source			2
