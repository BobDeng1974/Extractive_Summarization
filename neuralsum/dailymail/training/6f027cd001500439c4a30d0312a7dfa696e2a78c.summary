by @entity1 reporter published : 19:18 est , 13 february 2014 @entity3 : 20:00 est , 13 february 2014 sir @entity4 has been chosen as an unlikely co-star for singer @entity6 in a major @entity8 show – but admitted he initially thought it was a wind - up			1
the 73 - year - old confessed to searching for the @entity12 frontman on @entity13 because he could not name any of his hits			1
the unusual combination is one of two shows @entity6 has lined up with veteran pop knights , the other being with sir @entity20 in @entity21			1
@entity23 singer @entity6 has had many hits , but sir @entity4 admitted he would struggle to name them sir @entity4 told @entity27 yesterday : ‘ i said , “ my initial answer is yes but can you check it ’s not a joke ? is there an ulterior motive ? ” [ my manager ] got hold of @entity6 ’s management and he said , “ no , @entity6 ’s a fan and he ’d like you to be there			1
” so i said yes please			2
‘ the chances of me singing for 15,000 people in @entity41 are pretty well nil … so i thought it would be great			2
’ sir @entity4 admitted he would struggle to name @entity6 ’s hits			1
“ i could n’t tell you the titles			2
i ’ve just googled him to see what kinds of crowds he plays to and what sort of show he did			2
i ’m thinking , okay , it looks like a pop - rock show , ” he said			1
@entity6 is renowned for his hatred of meat and has at times insisted on it being banned in the vicinity of some performances , even walking off stage at the smell of burgers			1
the combination is one of two shows @entity6 has lined up with veteran pop knights , the other being with sir @entity20 in @entity21 but sir @entity4 , 73 , appeared to underestimate @entity6 ’s conviction			1
he said : ' i like to think he might eat some meat when i arrive , but i would n’t expect him to			0
so i do n’t think he ’d expect me to be vegetarian			0
' if i found he was offended by people eating meat then i wo n’t eat it in front of him			0
but i ’ll have a chicken curry afterwards			0
' asked about his set list for the night , he said : ' i ’m going to cut my show down to the best one - hour segment i can make it			2
' i ’ve had hits in the @entity78			2
i did have two songs in the top 10 - devil woman and we do n’t talk any more			2
they will have heard of @entity83			0
they know suddenly , which i sang with @entity86 [ @entity87 ]			0
i ’m just going to make it really difficult for @entity6 to follow me			1
he went on : ' people do n’t know me in @entity8			0
that ’s why i had no problem saying yes			0
if @entity6 asked me to support him in @entity23 , i ’d question it greatly			1
i ’d say , " you can have the first half and i ’ll have the second half			0
" ' but this is a different world			0
i ’ve had nine top 30 hit singles [ in the @entity8 ] but i have no identification out there			0
all i can say is " thank you @entity104 , or @entity6 " - i ’m not quite sure how to refer to him - and i ’m so grateful that he ’s thought of having me on the show			1
i ’d love to play to 15,000 people in the @entity78 and now i will			0
' @entity6 - whose @entity107 name is actually @entity6 , although his middle name is @entity104 - is playing a series of dates in the @entity8 this is not the first time @entity6 has teamed up with a 1960s chart star			1
in 1984 @entity114 duetted with @entity115 on a new version of their debut single @entity117 which made the top 30 .			0

it is one of two shows @entity6 has lined up with veteran pop knights
sir @entity4 has admitted to not knowing any of @entity6 *'s* hits
