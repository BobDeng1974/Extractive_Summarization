@entity0 was engulfed in another controversy as he became @entity3 ’s match - winner in the most dramatic fashion			1
the @entity6 striker grabbed the ball from captain @entity8 to take an 84th - minute penalty — a decision that led the injured @entity11 , who was working as a pundit for @entity13 , to accuse @entity0 of being ‘ a bit disrespectful ’ to @entity8			1
@entity8 and @entity15 both appeared to be angry as @entity0 took the ball but he stepped up to score — the 27th successful conversion of his career — and ensure @entity3 have a 1 - 0 lead to take @entity20 for the second leg of their round of the 32 tie			1
@entity0 ( right ) was in disagreement with @entity3 team - mates @entity8 and @entity15 @entity8 and @entity15 were unhappy that @entity0 took the ball for the late penalty against @entity29 in an attempt to defuse the row which millions watched on television , @entity0 later said on @entity33 : ‘ thank you hendo for let me take the penalty			1
we won that ’s what counts			0
’ the incident echoed what happened at @entity42 on january 19 when @entity43 took the ball from @entity45 but missed from 12 yards against @entity46			0
@entity47 would not clarify whether @entity8 was the designated penalty - taker but @entity11 said : ‘ @entity0 ’s been a bit mischievous by going against what the manager has planned			1
‘ credit to him — he ’s finished the penalty off but it would ’ve been very interesting in that dressing room if he had missed			0
i think we would have had a similar situation to what we had at @entity58 a couple of weeks ago			0
but @entity0 scored from the spot to give @entity3 a 1 - 0 win late on in the @entity62 tie @entity11 said that @entity0 was ' disrespectful ' towards @entity8 in the @entity63 ‘ rules are rules and codes are codes inside a dressing room and when a manager selects a penalty - taker , that penalty - taker should take it			1
it should ’ve been @entity8 but fair play to @entity0 , who was terrific when he came on			2
‘ with the pressure on his shoulders he slotted it away very well and it ’s a big goal for us			0
‘ @entity8 has handled the situation very well			0
he ’s known @entity0 wants the penalty really badly and is desperate to get on the scoresheet and he ’s stepped away at the right time			2
’ @entity47 said of the penalty , which was won by @entity84 when he was taken down by @entity85 : ‘ @entity11 should have taken it ! we got the win			2
we have a number of outstanding penalty - takers			0

@entity11 says @entity0 was ' disrespectul ' in taking penalty
@entity0 took the ball off designated penalty taker @entity8
scored 84th - minute winner for @entity3 from the spot against @entity29
then takes to @entity33 to thank @entity8 for allowing him the penalty
