a scientist who apparently worked in some capacity for @entity2 has claimed aliens on @entity4 are real and have made contact with @entity4 in a video posted shortly before his death			1
@entity8 apparently drew on his own personal experiences to reveal that extraterrestrials were in @entity11			1
and in a bizarre interview he also claims anti-gravity is one of several technologies being hidden by the government			2
in a video @entity8 ( shown ) says aliens are real and they have visited @entity4			1
he made the claims before he passed away on 7 august 2014			1
incidents such as @entity21 in 1947 were caused by aliens , he says			1
and he also shows off ' pictures ' of aliens and their home world the controversial video was apparently made shortly before mr @entity8 died on 7 august 2014			1
he had several patents attributed to him that were assigned to @entity2 , and he was apparently also a senior scientist at the company - although that claim is disputed			1
these patents include a magnetic drive , an light beam to find objects , a thermally energised electrical power source and a heat radiation detection system			0
mr @entity8 says aliens have visited @entity4 , and continue to do so			1
he says they come from a planet called @entity39 68 light - years away and can make the journey in 45 minutes			0
these aliens have fingers and toes like us and are five feet ( 1.5 meters ) tall			0
they are also apparently up to 230 years old - although mr @entity8 did n’t say if he meant a @entity45 year or a humble @entity4 year			1
and the aliens can even commute through telepathy			0
having visited @entity4 in their spacecraft , scientists here have apparently been reverse - engineering their @entity52 technology			1
this includes the accidental shooting down of a flying saucer in 1947 – infamously associated with the @entity21 incident			2
remarkably , mr @entity8 also says he gave a camera to the aliens to take pictures of their home world – which he shows off in a series of blurry images			1
and last but not least the @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 are also apparently working on anti-gravity technology			2
in the video mr @entity67 says there are @entity63 working on ufos from outer space 24 hours a day , reported the @entity72			2
he also says aliens hail from a planet 68 light - years away called @entity39 , but that it takes them just 45 minutes to reach our planet			0
‘ there are two groups of aliens , ’ said mr @entity8			1
‘ they divide them into two groups			0
it ’s like a cattle ranch			0
' one group are wranglers , and the others are rustlers - the stealers of cattle			0
’ among the other wild claims in the video , he says there is a special flight path to @entity11 from space			2
aliens at the base are apparently five feet ( 1.5 metres ) long and up to 230 years old			2
they each have five fingers , which are 30 per cent longer than ours , and five webbed toes			0
and the @entity104 apparently communicate through telepathy			0
in yet another bizarre claim , he also says scientists at @entity11 have been working with @entity64 and @entity65 counterparts to develop anti-gravity technology			2
his claims , understandably , have been met with widespread criticism and derision			0
speaking to @entity116 , @entity52 expert @entity114 , author of the @entity115 , said : ‘ this story has been received with equal measures of enthusiasm , curiosity , confusion and scepticism in the @entity52 community			0
some commenters have said that the alien mr @entity8 shows in his video looks oddly similar to a plastic one shown in shops ( pictured )			1
' was @entity8 delusional or telling the truth ? certainly , @entity8 believed in what he was saying , ' said @entity52 expert @entity114 mr @entity8 says scientists have been reverse - engineering @entity52 technology from aliens that have landed on @entity133 includes the accidental shooting down of a flying saucer in 1947 – infamously associated with the @entity21 ( stock image shown ) ‘ several people have noted that the alien in the pictures produced by @entity8 look very much like an alien doll sold by shops several years ago			1
‘ was @entity8 delusional or telling the truth ? certainly , @entity8 believed in what he was saying			0
‘ as long ago as 2008 he passed a polygraph test , during which he claimed he had worked on antigravity projects , alien technologies and had even met and photographed an alien , and examined at least eight different types of alien spacecraft			2
‘ @entity8 also revealed that he had received death threats and that security personnel had attempted to discredit him and tried to keep him from talking to the public			0
‘ and @entity153 at website @entity154 said : ‘ like so many stories in the @entity52 field , @entity8 ’s is enigmatic			1
‘ the whole affair could easily be written off as the delusional ramblings of an old man			0
‘ the only thing that causes one to pause is @entity8 ’s background			0
why would a high level scientist begin making up such wild stories ? ' @entity2 was yet to provide a comment on the claims when contacted by @entity116 .			1

in a video @entity8 says aliens are real and they have visited @entity4
he made the claims before he passed away on 7 august 2014
incidents such as @entity21 in 1947 were caused by aliens , he says
and he also shows off ' pictures ' of aliens and their home world
he apparently used to work as a senior scientist for @entity2
here he says he worked on anti-gravity and alien technology
but his claims have been widely derided by @entity52 experts and commentators
some have said pictures of the ' alien ' mr @entity8 shows look very similar to a plastic *toy*
