by @entity0 published : 06:58 est , 1 october 2013 updated : 13:46 est , 1 october 2013 hearing : an inquest has heard how @entity2 , who was killed by a falling branch , may not have died if the trees had been properly pruned an accounts manager who was hit by a falling branch at the @entity8 may not have been killed if the tree had been pruned properly , a hearing heard yesterday			1
@entity10 , 31 , died instantly when she was struck on the head by a 12inch - thick branch from a @entity14 cedar while she was strolling with two friends			1
rain and gusts of winds of up to 30mph had been sweeping around the gardens just before the branch fell			2
miss @entity2 ’s two friends ran when they heard a crack ‘ like thunder ’ , but when they looked back they found her lying on the ground covered in branches			2
@entity26 yesterday heard that it was a ‘ fluke ’ that only one person was killed or hurt at @entity29 , @entity30 , in september last year			0
the pre-inquest hearing was told either under - pruning or a phenomenon known as ‘ summer branch drop ’ , in which trees struggling to absorb water shed their branches , may have caused the fall			1
assistant coroner @entity37 said the probe should focus on whether proper trimming of the trees may have prevented the branch crashing onto @entity42			1
‘ there is the question of whether pruning the trees may have prevented the fall from happening ’ , she said			2
@entity47 , representing miss @entity2 ’s family , said that @entity29 may not have had a policy to deal with the dangers of summer branch drop			1
he told the hearing : ‘ @entity53 recognised the danger of summer branch drop and the implementation of it did not occur			1
‘ did @entity53 ever warn members of the public of summer branch drop and did they cease those warning ? did they take precautions by cordoning off areas and did they cease doing that as well ? ’ fall : the @entity14 cedar tree at @entity29 in south west @entity30 , whose branch hit account manager @entity10 scene : @entity47 , representing miss @entity2 's family , said if summer branch drop did cause the branch to collapse then @entity29 would need to take further measures to protect the public mr @entity47 added that if summer branch drop did cause the branch to collapse on ms @entity2 then @entity29 would need to take further measures to protect the public			1
‘ @entity53 is not only a @entity75 but a public body - it is virtually a public park that has visitors exceeding one million a year ’ , he added			0
‘ there is a public interest for people to know about this dangerous phenomenon			0
’ ms @entity2 , who was originally from @entity84 and lived in @entity85 , west @entity30 , worked as an account manager for @entity87			2
tragic : miss @entity2 ( pictured ) had been walking through the @entity8 with two friends at the time of the incident speaking outside of court , miss @entity2 ’s uncle , @entity91 , said the family wanted the issue of summer branch drop to be explored during the inquest to prevent further deaths			1
‘ we ’re not experts but obviously @entity29 has trees , a lot of them , so potentially there is a good reason for bringing this up , ’ he said			0
mr @entity91 , 49 , said his niece was a regular visitor to @entity53 , and added that the family would be ‘ forever grateful ’ for the support given to them by the gardens , including hosting a memorial event			0
her mother @entity111 , 54 , flew over from the family home in @entity113 after her death and held an emotional meeting with workers at @entity29			0
focus : assistant coroner @entity118 said the inquest should focus on whether proper trimming of the trees may have prevented the branch falling on to @entity42 ( pictured ) she said yesterday from @entity84 : ‘ for the first few weeks i had so many questions , back then i would not have let the inquest come to an end			1
‘ then i came to @entity53 and i saw the staff cry , they were devastated			0
i could see i was n’t alone in questioning what had happened and this had happened despite good people trying their very best			0
’ @entity29 was closed to the public after her death and remained shut the following day after severe weather warnings			0
the investigation has been passed from the police , who found no suspicious circumstances , onto the @entity139			0
