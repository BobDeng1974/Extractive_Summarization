@entity1 coach @entity0 and playoff hero @entity2 believe that their tiny club can upset ' the biggest team in the world ' when they play holders @entity7 on their home debut in the @entity10 's group stage on wednesday			1
' @entity7 are a galactic team			0
you know their budget and their players , ' @entity0 told a news conference at the @entity16 national stadium on tuesday			2
' it is an honour for us to play against the biggest team in the world			2
but despite the huge difference in class , our players are ready and well - prepared			2
@entity1 coach @entity0 says it is an honour to play against the world 's best players @entity28 ( left ) , @entity29 ( centre ) and @entity31 train on the pitch in @entity33 ' we 've talked a lot with the players			1
i 'm telling you honestly and responsibly , i 'm not worried and we 're not afraid			0
i want my players to be calm and give their best in this game			0
' @entity1 , who are based in the small town of @entity42 , were tipped to struggle in their first appearance in the @entity10 's group phase			0
the @entity46 champions , however , have impressed with their tenacity and quality , losing 2 - 1 to @entity49 only after a penalty in added time in a pulsating match at @entity52 two weeks ago			1
' it seems @entity7 are expected not only to win their matches but play entertaining football , too , and i think it 's our chance , ' said @entity0 , who replaced @entity58 after @entity1 's goalless draw at home to @entity61 in the first leg of their @entity10 third qualifying - round tie			1
@entity0 says his team are not scared of the likes of @entity67 ronaldo @entity68 puts his stars through their paces in @entity46 ahead of the @entity10 clash the club 's rise from obscurity began four years ago , when wealthy @entity46 businessman @entity75 took over the club and his investments started to pay dividends			2
the @entity79 have since had the upper hand over the traditional powerhouses of @entity46 football - @entity82 and their bitter city rivals , @entity16 - winning three successive league titles and reaching the @entity87 's last 16 last season			0
' we 'll play against the best players in the world , but we are confident that if we play as a team , we can stop them , ' said crowd favourite @entity2 , who had to go in goal for the penalty shootout in the second leg of their playoff tie against @entity98 , saving two spot kicks to put his side through			1
@entity1 thought they had sealed a crucial point with this late goal against @entity49 at @entity52 the @entity46 minnows put up a good fight but just missed out on their first @entity10 point @entity2 became such a hero that the club have named a stand after him at their 8,000 - capacity @entity110 in @entity42			1
however the ground does not meet the required standards for the @entity10 group match , so the @entity7 visit has been switched to the national stadium			0
' every player dreams to play against the best , ' added @entity2			1
' we 'll try to play as well as we did against @entity49			1
' we know it 'll be difficult , but we 'll fight			0
we hope for a good result			0

minnows came close to a shock against @entity49 on opening day
coach @entity0 believes they can shock @entity128 champions
play - off star @entity2 eager to test himself ' against the best '
