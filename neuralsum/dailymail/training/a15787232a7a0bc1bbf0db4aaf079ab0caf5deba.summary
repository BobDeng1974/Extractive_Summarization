' he backed mr @entity4 's renegotiation plan , but said @entity1 should be willing to walk away			2
' my position is that i think the prime minister is completely right			1
what we need to do is to say to our friends and partners " listen chums , this thing is n't working for either of us			0
your eurozone is causing all sorts of misery , plus the on - costs , the non-wage costs , of the way the @entity0 has been running and has legislated and regulated over the last 20 - 30 years are making the whole area completely uncompetitive "			2
' we need a renegotiation			2
we need a look at the way the thing is managed			0
we should be prepared to pull out			0
you ca n't go into a negotiation like that without being willing to walk away			0

he said @entity15 grandees such as former chancellor @entity87 and one - time leadership contender @entity88 were ‘ wrong ’ to say @entity1 should leave the @entity0 now			1
former @entity15 chancellor @entity89 also suggested @entity1 would be better off out , saying the economic advantages of @entity0 membership were ‘ vastly over-stated ’			1
and a third former chancellor , @entity28 ’s @entity92 said he now believed the ‘ case for leaving is stronger than staying in ’			0
@entity15 rebels last night revealed they had tabled an amendment to the @entity18 criticising the lack of legislation to hold an in / out referendum			1
mr @entity4 has told his mps he is unable to bring forward government legislation to enact his pledge to hold a referendum in 2017 because of opposition from the @entity25			2

if commons speaker @entity109 agrees to the vote it will be held next tuesday			0
mr @entity4 will be on an official visit to the @entity112 , but other cabinet ministers are expected to vote in what would be a criticism of their own @entity18 and a clear sign of dissatisfaction with the @entity118			1

backers include eurosceptics @entity124 , @entity126 and @entity127 , and maverick @entity128			0
the amendment does not demand legislation on a referendum but ‘ respectfully regrets ’ that no bill was included in wednesday ’s @entity18 , which set out the government ’s legislative agenda for the coming year			2
mr @entity124 said its purpose was to send a clear message that the demand for a bill was ‘ not going away ’			0
it underlines the pressure mr @entity4 is facing to sanction backbench legislation on a referendum			0
the prime minister ’s official spokesman said he had ‘ always said he is very happy to look at all ways of strengthening his commitment to an in / out referendum in the next @entity148 ’			1

he said : ‘ i think it is possible to change and reform this organisation and change and reform @entity1 ’s relationship with it			0
’ @entity25 sources said it would be ‘ extraordinary ’ for @entity15 ministers to vote against the @entity18			2
a source said : ‘ the conservatives seem to want to talk about @entity23 when we should be talking about the positive things in the @entity18 like the reforms on pensions and social care			2
