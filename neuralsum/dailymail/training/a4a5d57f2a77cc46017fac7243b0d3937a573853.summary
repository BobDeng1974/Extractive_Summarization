a @entity1 couple had the best intentions when they rescued a baby seal over the weekend , but their act of kindness could result in a $ 5,000 fine			1
@entity8 residents @entity9 and fiancee @entity10 were scuba diving at a @entity13 beach when they came upon a baby seal covered in bite marks			1
they brought the seal ashore and called a volunteer from the @entity18 , who refused to touch the seal and promptly returned it to the ocean			2
now , the couple may face a hefty fine for violating the @entity25			1
sealed with a kiss : @entity9 appears to receive a kiss on the nose from the grateful pup rescued : the seal pup has wounds all along its side , possibly from an encounter with a shark @entity9 and @entity10 were in the water at about 1:30pm when they encountered the little seal , which they say was having difficulty keeping its head above water to take a breath			1
' as i got a little bit closer , he just swam closer to me and jumped right up on my shoulder , ' @entity9 told @entity46 25			0
@entity9 noted that the seal had bite marks all along the side of its body , which he believes came from a shark attack			2
' you could just tell his whole body was in the shark			0
it had to have been , ' he said			0
distress : @entity57 says he was only trying to help the baby seal , which looked like it had been in a tussle with a shark disillusioned : @entity10 says she has n't stopped thinking about the little seal pup she and her fiance rescued on the weekend that was released back into the sea by a marine volunteer @entity10 recorded @entity9 lifting the two - foot seal onto a raft , at which point the seal pup appears to bestow a kiss on @entity9 's nose			1
he brought the seal to shore and called marine officials , but when the volunteer arrived , @entity9 claims they did n't want to help			1
the couple say the volunteer did n't seem to think the seal was in trouble , and asked them how the couple knew the seal was injured			1
' he turned around and asked me , " how do you know he 's really hurt , did you take an x-ray ? " ' @entity9 told @entity46 25			2
the couple was horrified when the volunteer released the seal back into the ocean			2
' they 're supposed to be there to help these little animals and they did nothing , nothing , ' said @entity10			0
' it breaks my heart			0
' help wanted : the couple say the seal was in dire need of help and that he probably drowned after being released into the water after @entity9 's rescue unresolved : the couple frequent this @entity13 beach but they 're unlikely to ever see the little seal pup again a spokesman for the @entity18 said , ' we try to not intervene with animals that do n't require rescue			1
this particular seal pup is right on that line in terms of doing that , but the trained staff that we had sent down there made a decision that he did n't merit that intervention			2
' ' i think he probably drowned , ' @entity10 said			0
' he 's been on my mind every minute since sunday			0
' touching marine mammals , including seals , is a violation of the @entity126 , and now the couple could face a $ 5,000 fine			1
they are in good company , with members of the @entity133 family also facing the penalty for recently helping an endangered turtle in the waters off @entity137			0
' this is a wild creature , asking you to help it out , ' @entity9 told @entity46 25			0
' why would n't you do it ? ' the @entity18 said that while the couple 's intentions were good , the best course of action would have been to call the @entity147 and stay near the creature in the water until help arrived .			0
