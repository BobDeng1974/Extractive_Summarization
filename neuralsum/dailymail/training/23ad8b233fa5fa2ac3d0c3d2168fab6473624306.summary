babies played music while still in the womb remembered the tune months later when part of the big , wide world			1
and the more they had heard @entity9 , before birth , the stronger their recognition afterwards			1
what is more , the effect was visible until at least four months of age			1
@entity15 ? scientists at the @entity17 tested 12 pregnant woman and claimed their babies could remember the tune of @entity9 up to four months after they were born ( file photo ) the finding suggests that mothers - to - be who develop a liking for @entity26 , @entity27 or @entity28 in the hope of boosting the development of their unborn child may not be wasting their time			1
@entity34 researchers gave 12 pregnant women a cd which and asked them to play it loudly five times a week during the last three months of pregnancy			1
they were instructed to destroy the @entity36 after giving birth to ensure any memory of the songs came from pregnancy			1
the study was careful to warn that a baby played classical music in the womb may not turn out cleverer than average			0
and turning up the volume by placing a speaker right on the mother - to - be ’s abdomen could cause more harm than good			2
the researchers did , however , suggest mothers - to - be play music they enjoy or sing lullabies			0
neuroscientist @entity57 , who contributed to the study , said : ‘ if a mother sings or hums some melodies during pregnancy , it may be more likely that the newborn will recognise those songs			1
‘ then singing or humming those melodies may be useful in trying to soothe the baby if he is crying			0
’ @entity67 , author of pregnancy book @entity69 , said : ‘ there is still no good evidence that playing music to your bump will boost your baby ’s brain development			0
‘ however , research suggests that unborn babies can learn to associate their mother relaxing with a particular song			1
' shortly after birth , the babies were played @entity9 , which had been repeated three times on the @entity36 , and their brainwaves measured			1
crucially , around one in eight notes of the lullaby had been altered			0
a second group of babies that had not be exposed to the song in while in the womb also had their brain activity measured			2
the brains of those who heard music before birth lit up more on hearing the lullaby - but only to the familiar notes			2
the more the song had been played before birth , the greater the child ’s recognition of it			2
it is known that babies can hear outside noises in the womb , although they sound rather muffled			2
previous research has shown that newborns remember words they heard before birth and even seem to recognise the theme tune of their mother ’s favourite soap opera			1
but this study showed that the memories are stored until they are at least four months old			0
writing in the journal @entity118 , the @entity17 researchers said exposure to music in the womb may influence a critical period of brain development			0
they said : ‘ these results show that babies are capable of learning at a very young age and that the effects of learning remain apparent in the brain for a long time			0
’ it was already known babies could hear noises outside the womb , although they sound muffled ( file photo )			0

scientists at @entity138 gave cds to 12 pregnant women
babies recognised @entity9 up to four months after birth
children already recognise the tune of their mother *'s* favourite soap opera
