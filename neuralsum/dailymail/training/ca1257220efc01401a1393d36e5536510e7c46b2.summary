four hours later , the new mother was cradling baby @entity19 in her arms			1
she said : ' it was the biggest shock of my life , i was completely stunned			0

' i would look at myself in the mirror and feel numb			0
i could look after , and be kind to other people , but not myself			0
' i started acting like a clown around my friends to cover up the sadness i had inside			0
' i was really unhappy and that made me want to eat more and more			0
' i wore a tent every day to cover myself up			0
i never felt normal or attractive			0
