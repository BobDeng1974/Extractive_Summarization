by @entity0 published : 09:10 est , 3 june 2013 updated : 09:10 est , 3 june 2013 after 90 tons of manure and two years of round - the - clock care , @entity2 's most expensive pineapple is almost ready to eat			1
ripening in the greenhouse at the @entity7 in @entity8 , the record - breaking fruit was grown using @entity10 cultivation methods and is worth an estimated £ 10,000			1
but if the @entity12 pineapple sounds pricey , then spare a thought for the @entity15 buyer who splashed out 1.6 million yen ( £ 10,300 ) for just two melons			1
expensive : @entity20 , or @entity21 , melons like the ones sold last week are a status symbol in @entity15 the record - breaking @entity21 , or canteloupe , melons were sold during an auction at @entity26 in northern @entity27 last friday			1
the eye - watering price is the third highest ever paid for the fruit , with the most expensive pair selling for 2.5 million yen ( £ 16,300 ) in 2008			2
although few command the price of a @entity21 melon , @entity15 is one of the most expensive places in the world for fruit and vegetables			2
a single apple typically retails for around £ 3.30 while the average price of a presentation pack of 20 cherries is a whopping £ 65.50			0
pricey : the @entity7 of @entity12 's pineapple ( left ) and the world 's most expensive fungi , truffles ( right ) three : the number of trips to @entity50 needed to collect 90 tonnes of manure four : number of people required to tend the pineapples and replace the old manure one : the number of painters needed to keep the glasshouse in pineapple - worthy condition but despite the high prices commanded by canteloupe melons , a status symbol in the @entity64 , there are some fruit and vegetables that cost even more			1
truffles regularly fetch more than £ 196,000 per pound at auction , while saffron sells for an average of £ 3,200			0
a single pound of saffron contains more than 225,000 stigmas from 75,000 crocus plants , while truffles are both rare and difficult to dig up			0
other painfully expensive varieties of fruit and vegetable include @entity79 grapes , which can sell for as much as £ 4,100 per pound at auction , which works out as roughly £ 170 per grape			0
similarly expensive are @entity83 potatoes , which are grown exclusively on the island of @entity85 , just off the @entity88 @entity87 coast			0
only 100 tonnes of @entity89 potatoes are grown each year , and they sell for a wallet - busting £ 210 for a single pound .			0

a @entity15 buyer splashed out £ 10,300 on a pair of melons last friday
canteloupe - or @entity21 - melons are a status symbol in @entity15
the @entity2 's own pricey fruit , a £ 10,000 pineapple , will be picked this week
