@entity0 deserves his reputation as a diver and he added to his collection of tumbles shortly after coming on as a substitute for @entity6			1
with the teams deadlocked it was clear that @entity6 were getting more and more desperate for a goal – hence the call for @entity0 to enter the pitch			0
whilst @entity12 may have made slight contact with his arm @entity0 went to ground and threw his legs out behind him making the possible contact irrelevant and the act worthy of an @entity20 nomination			2
@entity0 went down easily in the penalty box under the faintest of contact from @entity24 's @entity12 @entity0 , who came on as a late substitute , has a reputation as a diver and this did nothing to help it @entity0 's theatrics did n't impress the referee , however , who waved play on following the incident @entity0 replaced @entity34 with 14 minutes remaining at the @entity35 as @entity6 searched for a goal @entity0 's abundant talent is unfortunately overshadowed by his theatrics the additional assistant was perfectly placed and was unmoved for the penalty appeal but should have advised his colleague that a yellow card was appropriate			1
after a dive at the @entity44 in the summer @entity0 issued an apology – until he starts to get retrospective bans he will continue cheating to try and help his team			0
what a pity that such a talented player will be remembered for his theatrics rather than his obvious skill and pace .			0

@entity0 dived to try and win a penalty towards the end of @entity6 's match with @entity24 in the @entity56
@entity58 tumbled to the ground under the faintest of contact from @entity12 as he ran into the box
referee @entity64 was *unimpressed* and waved play on
the additional assistant referee should have advised a yellow card
@entity6 went on to win 1 *-* 0 thanks to @entity71 's late goal
