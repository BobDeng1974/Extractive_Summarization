by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 04:34 est , 3 may 2013 updated : 01:58 est , 6 may 2013 on trial : @entity3 , 38 , has been charged killing nine immigrant businessmen and a policewoman over a 13 year period a woman dubbed the ' @entity9 moll ' is standing trial accused of killing ten people after a 13 year reign of terror			1
@entity3 , 38 , has been charged killing nine immigrant businessmen and a policewoman in @entity14			1
she gave herself to police last year and is said to have told them ' i 'm the one you have been looking for , ' but has remained tightlipped ever since			0
prosecutors say she helped found the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) and faces life imprisonment if convicted			1
she is believed to have been locked in a macabre love triangle with two of her alleged accomplices who were found dead last november			1
' everyone in @entity14 knows her name but no one knows who she is , ' wrote the @entity14 daily @entity29			2
@entity14 police and intelligence agencies are braced for public fury when their collective failings are exposed at the country 's most scandalous @entity35 trial which starts on wednesday in @entity37			1
revelations that a string of unsolved killings may have been a cold - blooded @entity35 campaign against ethnic @entity42 have shaken the nation , forcing @entity14 to confront painful truths about racism and the broader treatment of immigrants in society			1
the @entity20 had allegedly been undetected until @entity3 blew up her rented flat in eastern @entity14 a year ago and gave herself up to police			1
the bodies of her alleged accomplices , @entity53 , 38 , and @entity54 , 34 , were discovered in a caravan in an apparent double suicide			1
the case is shaping up as an indictment against the entire @entity14 law enforcement establishment , its attitudes to dangerous neo-nazism and the failings which led authorities to believe that a single racist maniac - dubbed ' the @entity65 ' because so many victims ran fast - food outlets - was responsible for the assassinations			2
her trial will be held in the most heavily guarded courtroom since the cases against the @entity73 terrorists of the 1970 's were heard			0
gang : the bodies of her alleged accomplices , @entity53 , 38 , and @entity54 , 34 , were discovered in a caravan in an apparent double suicide last year love triangle : from left @entity53 , @entity3 and @entity78 who were all believed to be a macabre love triangle charged with participation in all 10 executions , 15 robberies , setting up a terrorist organisation and numerous arsons , @entity3 could expect , under normal @entity14 law , to be out after 15 years if convicted			1
but prosecutors are seeking to implement the special clause in the national law called ' particularly grievous guilt ' which allows the state to incarcerate particularly heinous criminals forever			0
she is in the dock along with four supporters			0
it is the biggest terrorism trials ever held in @entity14 of extreme right - wingers since the @entity98 republic was formed and security in @entity37 will be unparalleled			2
blown up : the @entity20 had been undetected until @entity3 blew up her rented flat in eastern @entity14 a year ago and gave herself up to police sewers have been sealed to prevent bombs being placed near the court , snipers will be on rooftops and police leave throughout @entity108 has been cancelled			1
@entity3 , idolised by @entity110 mass - killer @entity109 who wrote to her advising her to use her trial to spread ' right - wing propagnada , ' is branded by @entity14 's federal prosecutor @entity113 as being at the heart of planning and carrying out the murders			1
but the trial is about so much more than her - it is about the deep national sense of shame in police failings to stop the @entity20 , which was composed of @entity3 and two male sidekicks who were also her lovers			1
no link was ever made between the group and the killings , despite a vast covert intelligence network			0
victims : @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 and police woman @entity129 and bottom from left : @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 und @entity140 it has led to charges that certain police and intelligence chiefs wanted to protect the @entity20 because they admired them , although claims of a conspiracy have been fiercely rejected			1
the group was supported by a loose network of crazed neo-nazis who dreamed of a @entity150			0
during the killings no claim of responsibility was ever made ; the group hoped that the randomness of the murders would strike fear into @entity14 's immigrant population who would begin leaving en - masse			1
they went underground in 1998 and lived from the proceeds of bank robberies across the country			0
the cell imploded on november 4 2011 when her male accomplices @entity53 and @entity78 botched a bank raid			1
grief : @entity169 , right , and @entity170 left , pray at a memorial event on the seventh anniversary of the murder of their son @entity174 , who was killed by the @entity20 terror group , in @entity177 , @entity14 ( file photo ) remembrance : a monument to commemorate the victims of the @entity20 terror group is pictured in @entity182 in a pre-arranged plan to avoid capture , @entity53 shot his accomplice before turning the gun on himself			1
@entity3 , as instructed , blew up their hideout in the east @entity14 city of @entity190			1
but the blast and subsequent fire failed to destroy a mountain of evidence , including videotapes in which the trio allegedly boasted of their crimes			0
days later , as a massive manhunt stretched across the country , she turned herself in			0
prosecutor @entity113 , 64 , said collating the evidence against her was a ' herculean task			0
we collected 6,800 pieces of evidence , mostly from the wreckage of the burned - out house in @entity190 , and questioned about 1,200 witnesses			0
on our side , 10 public prosecutors ran the investigations , and the @entity212			0
' their central motive was to unsettle our fellow citizens of foreign origin -- the goal being that they would leave @entity14 , out of fear for their own safety			1
' idolised : @entity3 , pictured right after her arrest , is idolised by @entity110 mass - killer @entity109 who wrote to her advising her to use her trial to spread ' right - wing propagnada ' he said it was likely that the murderers were looking to create a ' monument ' for themselves with the killings			2
he said that @entity3 was involved deeply in the murders			1
he went on ; ' to visualize it , one could say that two people did the killing while the third person stood guard			2
not directly at the scene of the crime , but by handling the cover and the logistics			0
' by securing the apartment as an indispensable headquarters for the @entity20 , by cultivating the stories and by handling the group 's financial affairs			2
this is why we see @entity244 as a full co-perpetrator			0
she collaborated in all the murders and attacks			0
' there are a few clues that are already known			0
they include her fingerprints on newspaper articles about @entity20 attacks that were found in the wreckage at the site of the fire in @entity190			1
besides , the police also found many surveillance notes there			2
to me , this means that she knew what was going on			0
and there is also witness testimony that places @entity3 very close to the scene of a crime in @entity182			2
' she was an active participant in the discussions related to the group 's armed conflict , and she was involved in illegal activities with her accomplices for almost 14 years			2
for that reason , i am convinced that she was n't just an accessory or merely a companion , but was in fact acting on the same level as the others			0
' other controversies than the police bungling are swirling around the trial before the first opening statements			0
@entity37 authorities have failed to reserve a single seat for a member of the @entity42 media , despite the nationality of most of the victims			0
this has led to renewed charges of @entity14 racism at worst , and indifference at best , to foreigners in the country			2
the trial will open just days after police discovered a neo-nazi information service operating in the country 's jails seeking to contact @entity20 members			1
the network sent coded messages between prisons hidden in letters and the classified ads sections of magazines			0
again , the news seems to have failed to reach any outrage gene among @entity14 , who still break out in a cold sweat about left - wing violence .			0

@entity3 , 38 , has been charged killing nine people over 13 years
she is the sole survivor of @entity35 terrorist cell
two of her alleged accomplices were found dead last november
