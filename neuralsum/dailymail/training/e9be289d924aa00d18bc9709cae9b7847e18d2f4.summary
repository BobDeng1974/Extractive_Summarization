by @entity1 reporter it is where the @entity3 retreats each summer to enjoy the peace and tranquillity of the @entity8 countryside			1
but her beloved @entity10 estate could soon be offering the @entity11 a bit of competition in the rural rowdiness charts			1
the estate in @entity16 , @entity17 , is considering hosting rock concerts and other live events as it looks for new ways to pay its bills			1
the @entity10 estate in @entity17 , which features @entity10 ( pictured ) has long been the favourite summer retreat of the @entity3 , but staff are now looking for new ways to pays the bills @entity10 last hosted an open - air concert – its only one – in 2006 to mark the @entity3 ’s 80th birthday			1
the event was headlined by the @entity32 mezzo - soprano @entity31 and attracted a crowd of more than 4,000			0
now the estate – privately owned by the @entity3 and paid for by her – is looking into outdoor concerts in the spring and early summer before the @entity36 arrive for their annual stay			1
the estate is privately owned and maintained by @entity3 ( pictured on the grounds in 2006 ) @entity40 , visitor enterprise manager at @entity10 , did not rule out pop or rock concerts , saying : ‘ we are open to any suggestions suitable for the location			1
we are not planning to stage concerts ourselves – it would be up to others			1
’ on its revamped website , @entity10 says the picturesque grounds around the castle are available for hire			2
‘ @entity10 provides the perfect setting for your event , with wonderful scenery and the castle providing a magnificent backdrop , ’ it says			0
‘ whether you are planning a charity event , gala dinner , training course , team - building exercise , car rally , conference or even a concert , we can assist			0
‘ our events field is the ideal location for an outdoor function with full marquee facilities and parking nearby			2
’ it adds : ‘ for a number of years the events field has been the venue for large events such as @entity78 and also the @entity79			2
‘ it is also the regular setting for smaller events such as car rallies and specialist holidays with onsite accommodation			2
‘ if you would like to make an appointment to discuss the possibility of using the venue facilities at @entity10 , please do not hesitate to contact us			0
’ more than 50 companies paid £ 1,000 each for corporate tables at the previous concert , in aid of the @entity94 @entity95 , the blood cancer charity			2
@entity97 – often essential in the @entity98 – was laid on for artists and guests			0
the 50,000 - acre estate costs around £ 3million a year to run and attracts more than 70,000 visitors when it opens as a tourist attraction between april and the end of july			0
coming soon ? : the estate 's website says the grounds are available for hire before the royal visit , and staff have not ruled out the possibility of hosting open air concerts , like @entity11 , held on @entity113 however , the income they bring only meets around half the estate ’s @entity117 month @entity116 said the @entity3 should rent out her palaces and homes to help pay for repairs			1
a committee said she had been failed by advisers who spent too much money and did not do enough to save her deteriorating palaces			0
more than a third of the royal estate has been found to be below ‘ target condition ’ , with @entity130 and @entity131 in urgent need of repair			0
@entity10 ’s efforts to pay its way have been boosted by updating its online gift shop to offer a new collection of 21st - century souvenirs			0
the range includes @entity143 laptop bags and @entity145 cases , tiaras and even pink princess t - shirts , with matching socks			0
