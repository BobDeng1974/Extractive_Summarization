@entity0 must ditch his famous father from his training set - up if he is to realise his potential , according to promoter @entity4			1
@entity5 suffered his first career defeat last weekend against @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity10 middleweight @entity9			1
and while @entity4 believes the 25 - year - old has a bright future but is being hindered by his dad 's influence			1
@entity0 looks disconsolate with his father after losing to @entity9 last saturday @entity16 poses during rounds as @entity19 's trainer talks to him from outside the ropes @entity16 has consistently overshadowed his son in the build - up to his fights writing in his @entity25 column , he said : ' the boy is a terrific talent but in boxing terms needs to grow into a man – his own man			1
by that i mean he must step out of the all - enveloping shadow of his father , a great world champion he so closely resembles in his style , stance and mannerisms			2
' he also has his dad ’s arrogance , his heart and his bottle			0
but he has n’t yet got @entity43 ’s skills and strategical nous			2
and i am not sure that @entity47 ’s erstwhile @entity45 is the one to impart them			0
' that job is best left to the man who has trained them both			0
yet on saturday night , @entity53 , though nominally chief second , was virtually a bystander as posing pater , eccentrically clad as always and looking more like a character out of @entity57 than a working cornerman , hovered around them			2
' i really do n’t get this dad thing – and i doubt the son needs it			2
the bottom ' line is that a boxer only requires one person in the corner giving instructions , and that is the one who works with him on a daily basis : the trainer , the one who is reading the fight			0
the @entity73 have got to sort out their relationship			0
at the moment the @entity5 show seems more about @entity43 than @entity0			1
' while @entity5 must now rebuilt , @entity9 is the mandatory challenger for the @entity78 world title			0
he will face the winner of @entity81 's fight with @entity82 on saturday week			0
@entity9 ( right ) dominated @entity5 for the first half of the fight and did enough to win on points @entity5 was taking a large step up in class against @entity9 and showed he was n't quite ready @entity9 celebrates his victory which earned him a world title shot in the new year			1
