by @entity0 last updated at 1:55 am on 24th september 2011 it was one of the most audacious plans of the @entity3			0
a crack sas team was ordered on a death - or - glory mission to kill or capture one of the @entity7 ’ finest commanders at a @entity10 chateau in 1944			1
snatching field marshal @entity11 would be an ‘ immense ’ propaganda coup , the elite @entity14 soldiers preparing for the operation were told			0
however , the raid was abandoned hours before the four - man unit parachuted in			2
@entity11 was forced to return to @entity18 after being badly injured when his car was hit by the @entity20			1
the @entity21 1941 - 45 includes first - hand reports from the special forces unit 's disastrous first operation in november 1941 , from which only 22 of the 65 soldiers who took part returned			1
pictured , @entity28 founder sir @entity27 poses with some of his soldiers in their desert jeeps details of the daring plot have been disclosed for the first time in an extraordinary diary recording the remarkable early exploits of the @entity28			1
the secret tome , kept under lock and key since being compiled in 1946 , has been published in an effort to raise tens of thousands of pounds for @entity14 special forces troops – including dozens maimed in @entity42 – bereaved families and veterans			1
the 600 - page limited edition volume , weighing 25lb and bound in leather ‘ liberated ’ from the @entity7 , has been authorised to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the regiment			1
only 1,000 copies have been printed , with prices starting at £ 975			1
‘ the @entity21 1941 - 45 ’ collects rare and previously undisclosed photographs , top secret orders , first - hand accounts and reports – many written by @entity28 founder @entity27 – documenting the ‘ @entity58 ’ regiment ’s missions during the @entity3			1
newly released secret @entity28 records feature the succinct orders for an ambitious but unsuccessful mission to ' kill , or kidnap and remove to @entity63 ' @entity18 commander field marshal @entity11 ( seen here in the @entity66 desert ) in @entity10 in 1944 among the officers mentioned in the journal is @entity69 who led a number of audacious night raids and became one of @entity14 ’s most decorated soldiers			1
one of the most daring plots was the strike against @entity11 shortly after @entity76			0
a july 1944 order marked ‘ @entity79 ’ states : ‘ the following points should be borne in mind : if it should prove possible to kidnap @entity11 and bring him to this country the propaganda value would be immense and the inevitable retaliation against the local inhabitants might be mitigated or avoided			2
such a plan could involve finding and being prepared to hold for a short time if necessary a suitable landing ground			0
‘ to kill @entity11 would obviously be easier than to kidnap him and it is preferable to ensure the former rather than to attempt and fail in the latter			1
’ the order added : ‘ kidnapping would require successful two - way @entity94 [ walkie - talkie ] communication and therefore a larger party , while killing could be reported by pigeon			1
’ @entity11 may have escaped the @entity28 ’s clutches but he committed suicide three months later after being implicated in a failed attempt to assassinate @entity101			1
document : the original order for @entity104 , the regiment 's first major mission sir @entity27 was captured by the @entity18 but escaped only to be re-captured by the @entity107 before being sent to @entity108 the @entity28 was conceived as a commando force to operate in secrecy behind enemy lines			1
@entity27 , a brave young officer , dreamed up the revolutionary tactic of using small , elite , highly - skilled units to tip the balance of the war in @entity116 in @entity14 ’s favour			0
the first mission – known as ‘ @entity119 ’ – took place on 16 november 1941			0
the aim was to destroy squadrons of @entity18 and @entity107 aircraft based at two airstrips in @entity125			2
the operational order noted : ‘ it is most important that the enemy should be unaware of your having landed or of your presence			0
’ one @entity28 soldier , @entity131 , wrote that before setting off the commandos were given a meal ‘ fit for a king ... just like having whatever you wished before going to the gallows ’			2
but horrendous weather conditions meant the operation ended in disaster			0
one plane was shot down , killing all aboard , and those who landed uninjured could n’t locate drops of vital weapons and explosives			0
only 22 of the 65 soldiers who took part returned alive			0
subsequent successes – including forays into the desert to disable @entity152 planes – meant the @entity28 was expanded			2
commandos played a leading role ahead of the invasion of @entity107 and the @entity76 in june 1944 , which led the way to the liberation of @entity158			0
operating behind @entity161 lines , the troops helped the @entity162 disrupt @entity18 forces and provided vital intelligence for @entity76			2
despite its expertise , the @entity28 was disbanded in 1945			2
but one unnamed soldier was determined the regiment ’s history would not be lost over time			0
he compiled an extensive scrapbook of every document and photograph he could lay his hands on			0
he placed the diary under lock and key and it was only discovered when he handed it to the @entity176 shortly before his death in the late 1990s			0
placed in the regiment ’s highly - confidential archives , only a few were aware of its existence until it was discovered by a documentary maker			2
insight : the diary was launched at the @entity187 amid tight security toughest : @entity28 members undergo parachute training in the desert by jumping out of moving trucks instructors look on as young recruits struggle with their parachutes @entity196 : an @entity28 soldier and his pet in action during the @entity116 campaign colonel @entity201 , executive vice-president of the @entity176 , said : ‘ the diary is a unique document and going through it is a very humbling experience			1
it shows how extraordinary these men were			0
their deeds were astonishing but they are so matter of fact in their reports			0
’ the @entity28 was reprieved in 1947 as military chiefs sought its expertise			2
since then , the commandos have fought all over the world , including the conflicts in @entity215 , @entity42 and @entity125			0
more than 20 @entity28 soldiers have been killed or suffered life - changing injuries , including amputations , on sensitive missions to disrupt the @entity220 alone			1
