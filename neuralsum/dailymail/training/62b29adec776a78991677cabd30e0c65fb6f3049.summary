on sunday evening , as @entity3 ’s players were filing out of their charity ball , the lead singer of the @entity1 shouted at them to come home ‘ with the * * * * * * * trophy ’			1
it was 11.30pm and the lead singer @entity7 had the monied audience at the @entity9 in @entity10 in raptures as he belted out the band ’s new track @entity14			2
the @entity15 were the send - off act at the @entity17 and @entity18 dinner , a lavish affair put on by the @entity21 before their @entity23 preparations started for real			1
during the 2013 - 14 season , @entity46 , the @entity47 and the @entity48 at @entity49 have all benefited from the @entity21 on this night alone , @entity3 ’s players raised £ 362,000			1
it is an extraordinary sum of money , with various auction prizes fetching five figure sums from a room full of 500 , mostly wealthy guests			0
bidding to sit in @entity24 ’s executive box at @entity58 for one game and the chance to meet the @entity3 captain post-match fetched the best part of £ 30,000			1
an impromptu lot , proposed by event host @entity64 , to stand on the stage with the @entity3 squad for a ‘ selfie ’ was eventually sold for £ 12,000			1
a lot of drink had been taken by then , but it made somebody ’s night			0
then a round of golf with @entity3 keeper @entity73 and @entity74 went for more than £ 10,000 and six vip nights in @entity76 with three pals went for something similar			1
towards the end of the evening , a random guest approached a member of staff at the @entity83 and offered £ 1,000 for his official @entity3 tie			1
he instantly exchanged it on the proviso that it was the only item of clothing he was prepared to remove			0
it was quite a night			0
even @entity91 ’s squad of players , who are used to earning extravagant sums of money with the top clubs in the @entity96 , sat open - mouthed at the size of the bids			2
in an era when it is so easy to casually criticise the players , this event , in football parlance , could be described as ‘ a leveller ’			0
every member of that squad , from captain @entity24 and vice-captain @entity27 to @entity107 trio @entity106 , @entity108 and @entity32 , understood their roles and responsibilities			2
it has to be said , it was pretty refreshing			0
understanding their roles : the squad including ( from left ) @entity106 , @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 helped raise a lot of money many of them know that when it comes to the @entity23 , with group games against @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 to come , that it can get bloody			0
with the exception of @entity74 ( who was already in @entity132 ) and @entity118 ( excused until 11pm to celebrate @entity135 ’s @entity134 success ) , every @entity3 player was in attendance			1
they sat on tables of 10 and were allowed , with the permission of the head coach @entity91 , a glass of wine or a glass of beer with their meal			0
when the @entity15 ’ lead singer jumped on to a table of @entity3 players singing their classic @entity152 , he thrust a microphone into @entity31 ’s face and demanded that he sang the chorus ‘ i ’ve never been this far away from home ’			1
@entity73 was next and then @entity106 , clearly hoping to avoid @entity7 ’s gaze , was suddenly belting it out for the benefit of the audience			2
happy to help : @entity117 and @entity163 were all smiles but the @entity3 players were gobsmacked by the amount of money raised there was a good deal of respect in that room from the @entity3 squad as @entity172 , who runs the @entity21 on behalf of the players , spoke about the beneficiaries			1
in the past , financial support from the @entity21 has been sent to the earthquake victims in @entity177 ( 2010 )			0
in 2012 , when torrential rain forced @entity3 ’s @entity23 qualifier with @entity181 in @entity182 to be postponed for 24 hours , the players funded the extra night ’s stay for the stranded fans			1
during @entity172 ’s passionate speech the players listened intently , never once wavering to mess about with their mobile phones or turn to each other to speak as @entity172 outlined the @entity21 ’s aims			0
@entity172 , a former @entity3 team masseur who went on to manage @entity191 , explained that the squad ’s match fees are diverted to the @entity21 ’s charity partners			2
the stage is set : @entity1 performed their single @entity196 at the gala it has been this way since 2007 , when the more prominent and influential members of the @entity3 team generously decided to give them up in favour of charitable causes			1
as @entity172 continued , they seek no publicity ( he has no idea this has been written , for example ) and there is very little knowledge of the @entity21 ’s work			0
during the season , without fuss or fanfare , members of the squad commit to events all over country on behalf of the foundation			0
they do it unflinchingly and judging by @entity172 ’s sentiments , along with the video presentation , the visits from @entity3 ’s players make people ’s day .			2

a chance to meet @entity24 went for £ 30,000
round of golf with @entity74 and @entity73 went for £ 10,000
indie band @entity1 were the send - off act
@entity3 's players behaved impeccably at the @entity235 dinner
