more than 55 million birds are killed by cats every year in the @entity2 alone			1
but researchers have discovered that dressing felines in multi-coloured collars could drop this kill rate by 54 per cent			0
during tests , an anti-predation collar known as @entity8 ( @entity9 ) was found to give birds more warning about an impending attack due to their advanced colour vision			1
these animals have advanced colour vision compared to mammals			1
during tests the collar ( pictured ) reduced captures by 54 % in one year the $ 9 collar is sold by a @entity30 - based firm of the same name			1
it is available in yellow , red and rainbow designs and claims to ‘ save birds from cats			2
’ researchers from the @entity38 at @entity39 , @entity40 – led by @entity41 - wanted to put this collar to the test			0
during a two - year period , ms @entity41 and her team asked cat owners to report on the number and type of prey caught by their pets			0
birds can see certain light frequencies - such as ultraviolet - that humans can not see			0
many songbirds have feathers that reflect ultraviolet light to communicate and attract a mate			0
both birds and humans have photoreceptive ' cones ' in the retina located at the back of the eye that help the eyes see colour light			0
in humans , there are three types of photoreceptive cones which are sensitive to red , green , or blue , and this is called trichromatic colour vision			1
birds have an additional cone for tetrachromatic colour vision			1
this expands the visible light spectrum			0
birds also have up to 12 times the number of cones - around 120,000 cones per square millimetre - compared to humans			2
in the first year they studied the effectiveness of each individual colour and in the second year they concentrated on the rainbow collar			2
they discovered that the number of birds , reptiles and amphibians were reduced by 54 per cent across the board , but the rainbow and red @entity9 were more effective than the yellow			1
during the second year , captures were reduced by 47 per cent			2
however , captures of mammals such as mice and rats were not reduced significantly			1
the researchers said this is because birds , reptiles and amphibians have a more advanced colour vision meaning they could spot the collar more easily than animals with limited colour vision			1
birds , for example , can see certain light frequencies - such as ultraviolet - that humans can not see			0
many songbirds have feathers that reflect ultraviolet light to communicate and attract a mate			0
both birds and humans have photoreceptive cones in the retina located at the back of the eye that help them see colour light			0
the $ 9 collar is available in yellow , red and rainbow designs and claims to ‘ save birds from cats			1
’ researchers discovered that the number of birds , reptiles and amphibians killed were reduced when cats wore any collar colour , but the rainbow and red @entity9 were more effective than the yellow in humans , there are three types of photoreceptive cones which are sensitive to red , green , or blue , and this is called trichromatic colour vision			1
birds have an additional cone for tetrachromatic colour vision			1
this expands the visible light spectrum			0
birds also have up to 12 times the number of cones - around 120,000 cones per square millimetre - compared to humans			2
the researchers also said they found no evidence that cats maintained a lower predation rate once the @entity9 was removed			2
the researchers said this is because birds , reptiles and amphibians have a more advanced colour vision meaning they could spot the collar ( range pictured ) more easily than animals with limited colour vision ‘ the @entity9 is an option for owners wishing to reduce captures of birds and herpetofauna by free - ranging cats , especially where mammalian prey are introduced pests ’ explained the study			1
‘ to date , the @entity9 is the only predation deterrent that reduces significantly the number of herpetofauna brought home			0
’ almost 80 per cent of the pet owners said their cat showed no signs of distress when wearing the collar , and another 17 per cent said their cat got used to the collar within two days			0
the research was published in january in the journal @entity189 .			0

the anti-predation collar cover is called @entity8 ( @entity9 )
it *'s* easily spotted by birds , reptiles and amphibians - or ' herpetofauna '
these animals have advanced colour vision compared to mammals
during tests the collar reduced captures by 54 % in one year
@entity206 and red @entity9 collars were more effective than the yellow collars
the $ 9 collar did not *prevent* the cats catching mice and rats
