by @entity0 published : 02:55 est , 4 december 2012 updated : 06:33 est , 4 december 2012 nuisance neighbours in @entity2 will be exiled from the city and rehoused in ' scum villages ' made up of caravans or containers under constant police supervision			0
@entity9 's capital already has a special hit squad of municipal officials to identify the worst offenders for a compulsory six month course in how to behave			1
social housing problem families or tenants who do not show an improvement or refuse to go to the special units face eviction and homelessness			1
problem neighbours : the mayor of @entity2 plans to exile nuisance neighbours from the city and rehouse them in ' scum villages ' @entity25 , @entity2 's @entity26 mayor , has tabled the Â£ 810,000 plan to tackle 13,000 complaints of anti-social behaviour every year			1
he complained that long - term harassment often leads to law abiding tenants , rather than their nuisance neighbours , being driven out , @entity30 reported			2
the project also involves setting up a special hotline and system for victims to report their problems to the authorities			2
the new punishment housing camps have been dubbed ' scum villages ' because the plan echoes a proposal from @entity45 , the leader of a populist @entity47 right - wing party , for special units to deal with persistent troublemakers			1
' repeat offenders should be forcibly removed from their neighbourhood and sent to a village for scum , ' he suggested last year			0
' put all the trash together			0
' whilst denying that the new projects would be punishment camps for ' scum ' , a spokesman for the city mayor stressed that the special residential units would aim to enforce good behaviour			1
controversial @entity47 politician @entity45 , right , called for special units to deal with persistent troublemakers ' the aim is not to reward people who behave badly with a new five - room home with a south - facing garden			1
this is supposed to be a deterrent , ' he said			0
the tough approach taken by @entity71 van @entity25 appears to jar with @entity2 's famous tolerance for prostitution and soft drugs but reflects hardening attitudes to routine anti-social behaviour that falls short of criminality			0
shipping container homes are already in use across @entity9			0
ten have been set aside for the anti-social behaviour project			0
others are already used for student housing ( pictured ) there are already several small - scale trial projects in the @entity47 , including in @entity2 , where 10 shipping container homes have been set aside for persistent offenders , living under 24 - hour supervision from social workers and police			1
under the new policy , from january next year , victims will no longer have to move to escape their tormentors , who will be moved to the new units			2
a team of district ' harassment directors ' have already been appointed to spot signals of problems and to gather reports of nuisance tenants .			0
