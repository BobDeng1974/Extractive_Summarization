the sound of an alarm is bad enough at the best of times , but hearing your partner ’s alarm - especially when you do n’t have to be up - can be a major source of irritation			2
hush earplugs aim to solve this problem by only playing the alarm directly in the wearer ’s ears			1
the smart buds link to an app via @entity16 to play soothing music , and block out external noises such as a busy road , or someone ’s snoring			1
they connect to an app via @entity16 and the earplugs play soothing music to help wearers get to sleep , while blocking external noises			1
and when it ’s time to get up , the alarm sounds directly in the earbuds , without disturbing anyone else hush earplugs were created by three engineering students from @entity26			1
the whole process from design to sale has taken 11 months and the trio has launched a @entity45 campaign to fund production of the plugs			1
to block out noise , @entity24 is fitted with sound eliminating foam and uses noise masking to isolate the wearer from external sounds			1
an app is hoping to put people in a good mood in the morning by making them smile to switch off their alarm			2
dubbed ‘ @entity59 ’ , the app requires users to grin into their smartphone camera before its incessant buzzing is turned off			2
the camera tracks key features on a user ’s face and then determines whether that person is happy enough to be allowed out of bed			0
it even helps the user crack a genuine smile by showing pre-selected images , or playing songs designed to make someone ’s day			0
they are either silent , or can be programmed using the app to play a variety of sounds from white noise , to ocean waves and a crackling fire			0
and when it ’s time to get up , the smartphone 's alarm plays the sound through the earbuds , without disturbing anyone else			0
additionally , users can customise notifications so they are always woken up in an emergency , when a certain contact calls or sends a message			0
‘ two of the most popular methods of dealing with noise disturbances when you 're trying to sleep are earplugs and sound machines , ’ explained the firm			0
‘ however , earplugs have physical limitations in blocking out sound because even when your canal is completely sealed off , sound still gets through to the eardrum by conducting through your bones			0
‘ similarly , sound machines are limited in how much sound they can mask as they can only be played so loudly until they become a deterrent to sleep themselves			0

@entity140 , @entity24 ’s chief executive , said : ‘ we have launched a new way for people to deal with noise , perhaps the most significant deterrent to sleep			2
‘ as engineering students living in dorms , we often found our sleep distracted by a variety of noises			0
‘ @entity24 's smart earplugs allow for a better night 's sleep with the ability to hear important notifications			1
’ and , if the hush plugs fall out or are lost , they can be tracked using the app.			0
