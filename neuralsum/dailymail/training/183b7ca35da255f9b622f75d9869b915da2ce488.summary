busting at the seams : @entity1 has always found it difficult to find clothes to fit her size 8 figure and @entity7 bust some women may envy my size 8 figure and @entity7 bust but , believe me , they do n't come without their own particular challenges			1
i have n't dared run for a bus since 1976 , for example , and have lost count of the number of men who look me firmly in the breasts when talking to me , without making a single moment of eye contact			0
but perhaps the biggest problem of all is finding clothes that actually fit when , like me , you have a bust that 's bigger than the rest of your figure			1
there are many thousands of us big - busted girls out there			1
indeed , a third of @entity34 women say they have to buy a bigger dress size just to accommodate their breasts			1
dresses , bikinis and anything that fastens at the front ( from shirts to jackets ) are generally off - limits : for if they fit round the bust , they undoubtedly look like a tent everywhere else			1
if they 're a perfect fit around my waist , then they gape and strain , fit to burst , over my bust			2
neither is an elegant look			0
so it 's not before time that a canny clothes manufacturer has designed a new range for big - breasted women of any size , cut with extra room so you no longer need to wear a circus marquee just to ensure your chest remains under wraps			1
the genius of the @entity68 range by @entity69 is not only that its size 8 - 18 clothes come with carefully positioned buttons , darts and seams to give even the largest - busted lady a more streamlined shape , but that each item is available in @entity78 , really curvy or @entity78 , depending on just how much extra breast room you need			1
curvy is cut for women who find tops and frocks tend to pull a little tightly across the chest ; really @entity78 is for those who tend to have to go up roughly one dress size to get a good fit over their breasts ; and @entity78 is for women like me - who normally have to forego our natural dress size altogether if we 're to have any hope of accommodating our ample bosoms			1
clothes that are generously cut over the bust , yet nip back in to follow the line of your body ? they certainly sound too good to be true			2
so i tried the new autumn range , which hits stores this week , in a @entity78 size 8 to find out ... full skirt floral stripe dress , £ 79for me , if dresses fit the hips and waist , they 're too tight over the bust			1
i see so many that i have to leave on the rails , as i know they 'll never @entity113 : the use of double darts in an inverted ' v ' means the extra fabric needed to cover an ample bosom is nipped in for a fantastic fit			0
but it 's way too young and fussy for me			2
5/10 perfectly simple v - neck t - shirt in red , £ 22 , jersey blazer in navy , £ 65fitted jackets are normally a no - no. and if i can find a t - shirt that fits my bust , the rest of it is big and baggy			1
verdict : my favourite look			2
the jacket accentuates my waist , skims my hips and accommodates my breasts			0
the t - shirt fits perfectly thanks to some neat little darts			2
10/10 floral jersey dress in red floral , £ 49i love a wrap dress but usually end up showing so much cleavage i look like an ageing glamour model			0
i avoid them or have to wear a frumpy high - necked vest underneath			2
verdict : it 's fabulous - the high neckline means my breasts are firmly under - wraps			1
if this came in different prints and colours , i ’d be sold.8 / 10 belted workwear dress , £ 79 , with peplum suit jacket , £ 79 , in midnight blue jackets usually gape or pull across the bust , feeling like a straitjacket			2
i ’ve never owned one that fitted @entity159 : the jacket is well - cut , lovely and trim around the waist and the peplum is fun			0
i ’d get lots of wear out of the dress			0
the fabric feels a little flimsy , but i could live with that			0
7/10 classic shirt in white , £ 39whenever i see women wearing white shirts with business skirts or jeans i think how stunning they look , but i ca n't go there			0
within an hour or two , i 'm always missing a @entity175 : @entity176 ! it fits my bust and my waist with no signs of strain , even after a few hours			0
the extra fabric is gathered in by two seams , keeping it flush against your torso			0
7/10 floral peplum top in navy print , £ 39fitted tops have always been a no - go : it ’s impossible for a standard size 8 to fit well in both the bust and the body			1
i always end up feeling as if my breasts have been @entity195 : this top is versatile , wearable and fun			0
i could easily wear this with a smart skirt for work , or dressed - down with jeans.8 / 10 for details , call 01926 459 800 or visit @entity201 styling : @entity203 , pictures : @entity205 , hair and make - up : @entity208 : @entity209			0
