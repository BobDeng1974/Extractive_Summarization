@entity1 manager @entity0 is braced for bid from @entity4 clubs for teen talent @entity5 once the january transfer window opens – but insists there is no financial pressure to sell			1
@entity5 , 18 , announced himself in the @entity10 with a hat - trick against @entity12 last saturday and is in talks with his club over a new two - year deal			1
his current contract has 18 months to run			2
@entity0 believes @entity1 is the best place for the winger ’s development , with @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 monitoring his situation			1
@entity22 had a £ 500,000 bid for @entity5 rejected in the summer and the @entity26 manager says it would take a large offer to force even consideration			1
@entity5 ( right ) celebrates smashing a hat - trick against @entity12 on saturday @entity5 ( left ) is attracting interest from several @entity4 clubs but has been urged to stay at @entity1 ‘ he ’s as good as any young player i ’ve seen at this age , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ at 18 years old , the ability to score a hat - trick at @entity10 level does n’t happen very often			1
he ’s an exciting player			2
he gets the fans off the edge of their seats			2
‘ i ’m realistic , i would expect some interest in january and i would expect that interest to be very strong from top clubs , because he is a top player			0
‘ but also you have to look at that he ’s playing regular football in the championship			0
sometimes for a young player it ’s just as important to get 100 starts than go to a bigger club and sit on the bench or play in under 21 squads			0
@entity5 ( left ) seals his hat - trick against @entity12 with a neat finish on saturday ‘ what he ’s shown is we should n’t be looking to sell him for a low fee just to fit his ambitions			1
the club has a real potential star player on its hands			0
‘ we obviously have to manage him , manage his expectations , manage what he does on the pitch because he ’s got a lot to learn still			0
i would expect if someone does want to buy him he ’s not going to come			0
there are not many young @entity71 players around who can go past people , are quick , and can score goals			0
’ @entity74 are the @entity75 of @entity76			0
this season , a £ 250,000 @entity77 will go to a @entity76 club to spend on players in the 2015 summer transfer window			1
