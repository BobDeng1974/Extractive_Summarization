the new glasses have been designed to allow medical professionals to more easily locate veins for intravenous ( iv ) treatments			1
two companies behind innovation and claim it makes iv access fast , accurate and precise , which could result in better patient care when the glasses are used in hospitals			0
an image of what a nurse wearing the glasses might see is pictured on the right			0
the glasses are designed so that medical professional can pick the best vessels the @entity36 that is used to detect veins has been developed by @entity38 , an imaging technology firm based in @entity40 and @entity42 electronics company @entity41			1
they said the glasses are ‘ one of the first healthcare applications of smart glasses commercially on a global scale ’ as well as the first point - of - care wearable system of hands - free real - time vascular imaging			0
the glasses are designed to be worn by nurses at the bedside to quickly visualise a patient ’s veins and to make intravenous access , ‘ fast accurate and precise ’			1
in a promotional video , @entity38 said its technology means nurses will no longer have to guess which vein is best and the glasses will probably reduce the amount of failed attempts to access a blood vessel , which can be unpleasant for patients			2
the company said it allows medical practitioners to ‘ access the best vein for every patient every time			0
’ the system is based on @entity38 's bulkier vascular imaging technology that shows the veins beneath a patient ’s skin on a large screen , but now the image can be projected onto the head - mounted display of the glasses			1
it is hands free and ‘ projects overlays of digital content onto the real - world in the centre of the wearer ’s field of view … enabling a seamless blend of the physical and digital worlds , ’ according to the company			0
the smart spectacles allow medical practitioners to store images and videos and share them remotely via @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99			2
the glasses use technology from @entity41 's @entity102 - 100 glasses ( pictured ) , which have an hd screen for an immersive effect , and claim to let users experience content in new ways a power supply and belt - mounted computer keeps the glasses lightweight , while multi spectral lighting ( which emulates good quality natural light ) allows them to pick out fine details ‘ on and beneath the skin ’			1
‘ studies have shown that up to 40 per cent of iv starts require multiple attempts to locate and access a vein , which not only wastes valuable nursing time but also delays therapy and causes patient discomfort and dissatisfaction , ’ said @entity118 ceo @entity117			0
‘ with @entity118 ’s @entity36 , nurses can quickly and easily locate and access the best veins for each patient — even in challenging clinical environments			1
’ the glasses will begin shipping in the first quarter of 2014 , according to @entity134			0
the smart spectacles allow medical practitioners to store images and videos and share them remotely via @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99			2
multi spectral lighting allows them to pick out fine details ' on and beneath the skin '			1

@entity38 in @entity40 *partnered* with @entity41 to develop glasses
they are designed to be worn by nurses at the bedside to quickly visualise a patient 's veins so they can always pick the best one to access
full spectrum lighting lets medical professionals to pick out fine details ‘ on and beneath the skin ’ and the glasses can store and share images remotely
