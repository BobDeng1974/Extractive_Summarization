by @entity0 published : 11:31 est , 9 may 2012 updated : 13:34 est , 9 may 2012 body in the bag spy @entity5 could have easily locked himself inside the holdall in which he died , an @entity2 veteran revealed today			1
the inquest into the @entity10 agent ’s death heard how a number of experts unsuccessfully tried to lock themselves inside a bag up to 300 times			1
but @entity15 , 49 - a sergeant in the @entity17 for 22 years - discovered a simple method by which a holdall can be zipped up and locked from the inside without assistance			1
intrigued by the mysterious case of the @entity10 agent , he asked his daughter @entity36 , 16 , to climb inside an identical @entity38 bag to test his theory			1
the teenager , who at 5ft 5ins was 3ins shorter than @entity5 , easily fitted inside the bag in the foetal position before partially closing it			1
she drew her legs up to her body and was able to draw the two zip pulls together while leaving a gap for her hands to protrude through and close the padlock			2
@entity36 then tensed her body and the zip simply sealed itself leaving her successfully shut inside the bag holding the key to the padlock			2
squeeze : mr @entity15 's daughter @entity36 , 16 , begins the process of getting inside the holdall inside : @entity36 begins to do the zip up but crucially , the procedure is said to be much easier in a bath where the occupant of the bag can push against the sides for assistance			2
@entity15 , of @entity64 , @entity65 , served around the world as a sergeant with the 33 regiment , @entity17 , for 22 years until he retired five years ago and has been a reservist ever since			2
he claims that , despite mr @entity5 being taller than his daughter , this would not have made much difference			1
he said : ‘ the man on tv tried it 300 times and i was amazed he could n’t do it			2
‘ i ’ve told my friends and show them and their jaws drops - it is so obvious , maybe people are thinking too much into it			0
‘ she is 5ft 5 and he was 5ft 8 but when you ’re in the foetal position inside that height does n’t make much difference			1
‘ she had a bit of a struggle pulling the bag but she would n’t have been as strong as him			0
i could easily see that he would be able to do it			0
nearly there : @entity36 finishes off with the zipping process secured : using a padlock , @entity36 secures the bag a similar technique is used to steal from locked holdalls , where the end of the bag can be squeezed together to create ‘ slack ’ in the zip			0
this creates enough room for an opening in the zip without unlocking the padlocks			0
however , one of the reasons why other experts said they could n't zip themselves in bags was because there was n't enough room to manoeuvre in a bathtub			0
mr @entity15 contacted the @entity115 via the force ’s 101 number and he was provided with a serial number but they have yet to respond to him			0
a spokesman for the force refused to comment today			0
the revelation raises questions over the coroner ’s findings , which concluded mr @entity5 ’ death ‘ unnatural and likely to have been criminally mediated ’			1
mysterious death : @entity5 was found dead inside a holdall in his bath failed : a reconstruction showing a yoga specialist trying to lock himself in a sports holdall shown at the inquest mr @entity5 ’ former landlords told the inquest how they once found him handcuffed alone to a bed , suggesting he had a fetish for restraint			1
to test the method , reporter @entity139 , who is 5ft 4in tall and of slight build similar to mr @entity5 , zipped herself into the bag without assistance			1
she repeated the task a number of times on video and was eventually able to do it in less than three minutes			0
video : @entity149 helped to prove the feat could be performed ...			0
