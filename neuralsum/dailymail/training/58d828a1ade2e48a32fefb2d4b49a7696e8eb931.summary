by @entity0 for @entity1 boys are twice as likely to be diagnosed as having special educational needs as girls , new @entity6 figures have revealed			1
across @entity8 there are almost 1.5 million children in state schools , classed as having some form of learning difficulty or disability that makes it harder for them to learn than most children of the same age			1
of those , 911,900 boys have been diagnosed with @entity18 compared to 487,885 girls			1
they include issues including behaviour problems , emotional and social difficulties and speech , communication and language needs			1
pupils from poorer backgrounds , those from some ethnic minorities and children in care are more likely to be considered to have a special need , the @entity33 ’s ( @entity33 ) data shows			1
boys are twice as likely to be diagnosed as having special educational needs as girls , new @entity6 figures have revealed			1
file picture it reveals that as of january , just over one in six pupils ( 17.9 per cent ) were considered to have special educational needs ( @entity18 ) - a total of 1.49 million youngsters			1
this figure has been in decline since 2010 , when 21.1 per cent of children were classed as having sen. the latest statistics also show a continuing gulf between the sexes , with almost a million boys ( 911,900 youngsters ) considered to have @entity18 , either with or without a statement of needs , compared to less than half a million ( 487,885 ) girls			1
boys are known to be more prone to being diagnosed with autism , though scientists are undecided as to why			2
a recent study , published in the @entity59 , suggests girls require more extreme genetic mutations than boys to develop the condition			2
as a result , it is less likely that they will be pushed over the diagnostic threshold for autism			0
the new government figures also show that pupils with @entity18 are more than twice as likely to be eligible for free school meals - a key measure of poverty - than those without learning difficulties ( 29.1 per cent compared to 13.4 per cent ) , while almost seven in 10 ( 67.8 per cent ) of children in care have special needs			1
black pupils are most likely to be diagnosed with some form of learning difficulty or disability , the figures show , while @entity85 youngsters are the least likely			1
the most common types of need for pupils classed as having special needs are speech and language difficulties and behavioural and emotional issues , a government analysis of the data concludes			1
this analysis goes on to look at the achievement of @entity18 pupils , and shows that at the end of primary school , 34 per cent of youngsters with learning difficulties achieved the level expected of their age group in reading , writing and maths , compared to 88 per cent of their classmates			1
across @entity8 there are almost 1.5 million children in state schools , classed as having some form of learning difficulty or disability that makes it harder for them to learn than most children of the same age			1
they include issues such as behaviour , emotional and social difficulties and speech , communication and language needs at @entity124 , in 2012/13 just under one in four ( 23.4 per cent ) of @entity18 teenagers gained at least five c grades , including @entity8 and maths , compared to 70.4 per cent of those who were not considered to have a special need			1
today ’s data comes just days after a new system of support for children with special needs came into effect			2
under the reforms , new education , health and care plans , which stretch from birth to 25 , will replace @entity18 statements and learning disability assessments to create a ' simpler and more joined up ' system in @entity8			2
researchers in @entity144 suggest girls require more extreme genetic mutations than boys to develop autism , explaining why more boys are diagnosed a team of researchers earlier this year claimed to have discovered why autism is more common in boys than girls			2
a study , published in the @entity59 , suggests girls require more extreme genetic mutations than boys to develop the condition			0
as a result , it is less likely that they will be pushed over the diagnostic threshold for autism			0
study author dr @entity164 , of the @entity165 in @entity144 , said : ‘ this is the first study that convincingly demonstrates a difference at the molecular level between boys and girls referred to the clinic for a developmental disability			2
‘ the study suggests that there is a different level of robustness in brain development , and females seem to have a clear advantage			0
’ research has previously shown that autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( @entity182 ) are both more common in boys			0
indeed , about 1.8 per cent of boys have autism compared to just 0.2 per cent of girls			2
some researchers have suggested that there is a social bias that increases the likelihood of diagnosis in boys , whereas others have proposed that there are sex - based differences in genetic susceptibility			0
however , past studies investigating biological explanations for the gender bias have proved inconclusive			0
to examine this question , dr @entity164 teamed up with dr @entity203 , from the @entity204 , to analyse dna samples from 16,000 people with neuro - developmental disorders - impairments in the development of the brain and central nervous system - and from 800 families affected by autism			0
@entity214 - developmental disorders include autism but also @entity217 ’s syndrome , @entity182 , @entity219 ’s syndrome and traumatic brain injuries			0
the researchers analysed both individual variations in the number of copies of a particular gene and dna sequence variations			0
they found that girls diagnosed with a neuro - developmental disorder including autism had a greater number of harmful genes than did boys diagnosed with the same disorder			2
and women diagnosed with autism had a greater number of harmful dna sequence variations than did men with autism			0
the findings suggest that the female brain requires more extreme genetic alterations than does the male brain to produce symptoms of autism or other neuro - developmental disorders			0
the results also take the focus off the male x chromosome for the genetic basis of the gender bias – they suggest that the genetic difference is seen across the dna			0
dr @entity164 said : ‘ overall , females function a lot better than males with a similar mutation affecting brain development			0
‘ our findings may lead to the development of more sensitive , gender - specific approaches for the diagnostic screening of neuro - developmental disorders			0

new government figures show there are 1.5 million children in state schools classed as having a learning difficulty or disability
almost one million boys have special educational needs compared to around *500,000* girls who have been diagnosed with @entity18
can include behavioural issues , emotional and social difficulties and speech , communication and language needs
pupils from poorer backgrounds and those in care are more likely to be considered to have a special need , the @entity33 found
