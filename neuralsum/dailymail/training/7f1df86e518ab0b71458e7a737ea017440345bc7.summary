the @entity2 man who brought @entity3 to @entity4 came to the @entity4 to marry his fiance , it emerged on friday			1

tragically he is now fighting for his life and his partner 's family are quarantined in their home ( above ) until that point he had not even heard of @entity33 and there were not plans he was aware of for a wedding , he added			1
the revelation may explain why @entity6 , who was exposed to @entity3 days before he was due to travel to the @entity4 when he helped a sick woman who later died , lied on a form to get out of @entity2			1
@entity6 replied ' no ' when he filled out a form asking if he had been exposed to the ebola virus before he boarded the plane in @entity2			2
he now faces prosecution there			0
until three years ago he had been living in a refugee camp in @entity46 because he was unable to return home due to a civil war in @entity2 - and on his arrival just about scraped a living tinkering with cars and bartering			1
@entity6 arrived in the @entity4 on september 20 and is believed to have come on a tourist visa in what was his first trip to @entity4			1
up to 100 people including five schoolchildren were exposed to him while he was infected - health authorities in @entity59 now say that 10 people are of particular concern			2
an email about his marriage was also sent to the congregation of the @entity12 in @entity65 , where @entity7 is a member , by senior pastor @entity66			1
it read : ' @entity7 and other members of her extended family are in isolation now because of their contact with mr @entity6			1
' you can imagine how frightening this must be for all of them , mixed with the sadness of mr @entity6 's diagnosis			2
' @entity6 , 42 , and @entity7 , 54 , appear to have a relationship of some king going back many years and have at least one child together			1
@entity6 had good reason to escape his life in @entity82 - it is ground zero for the worst outbreak of @entity3 in history which has so far claimed more than 3,000 lives			2
@entity6 has also suffered personal tragedy and one of his brothers recently died too			0
according to the @entity90 he spent the last year working as a driver for a cargo company until he suddenly quit on september 4 after a visit from his sister			2
@entity7 , a caregiver , arrived in the @entity4 in the late 1990s from @entity2 and settled in @entity96 where her immediate family still live			1
she got a social security number and has dozens of immediate and extended family members in @entity4 stretching from @entity100 to @entity101			0
she married her ex-husband @entity102 though they have now divorced			0
@entity7 has been living in the @entity104 , a run - down complex of homes in the suburb of @entity65			1

better life : @entity6 had good reason to escape his life in @entity82 - it is ground zero for the worst outbreak of @entity3 in history which has so far claimed more than 3,000 lives			2

she lives on the same street as @entity6 did			0
he had been in contact with another woman who died of the virus the area is home to many immigrants and dozens of languages are spoken in the area			0
residents told @entity13 that gangs were a problem and that people moved in and out every few months with little sense of community			0
@entity7 appears to have been a regular visit to @entity2 and on her @entity153 page ' checked in ' as being into @entity131 as recently as august 11			0
according to visapro.com it is possible to marry on a tourist visa but there are a number of issues			1
if somebody in such a position gets married within 30 days of arriving in the @entity4 it is frowned upon by the authorities			2
however even if @entity6 's application would have been denied the marriage would have bought him months in the @entity4 whilst it was processed			1
@entity165 says : ' once you have married and filed for adjustment of status you will not be able to leave the @entity4 until you apply for and receive advance parole or your green card			0
' if you leave the country before receiving one of these two documents , you will not be allowed to re-enter the @entity4			0
