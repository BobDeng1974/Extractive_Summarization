war of words : aspiring model @entity7 , right , whose 36dd taxpayer - funded breasts sparked public anger has criticised @entity15 , left , for having a £ 5,000 tummy tuck on the @entity6 speaking to @entity23 , miss @entity7 said : ' this is an incredible waste of taxpayers ' money			1
thousands of mothers have the same problem after childbirth			2
@entity15 should have just worked harder at losing her baby bump naturally			1
' miss @entity15 said she lost her confidence after having three children and was embarrassed to show her ‘ mummy tummy ’ to men			1
she also wanted the surgery to increase her chances of pursuing an acting career because she wants to be the next @entity38			2
but the part - time beautician , who earns £ 7,000 a year , could not afford the procedure and pleaded with doctors to help her get rid of her bulge			2
controversial : @entity15 's decision caused a media furore but she is unrepentant after 18 months of visiting her gp , she was referred to a surgeon for the taxpayer - funded operation			1
miss @entity15 , who once appeared on @entity50 ’s @entity49 show , said : ‘ what people need to understand is that it has been really hard for me			1
‘ i constantly looked pregnant and it was affecting my social life			2
i had no confidence when i went out with my friends			2
' but one of the worst things was that i felt embarrassed when i took my clothes off in front of men and so it affected my sex life and i ’d just had enough			2
‘ the new tummy makes me feel a lot more attractive and i have already been out with friends and my sex life is also slowly improving			2
‘ and if it helps my career as an actress , something i ’ve always wanted , then i do n’t think i ’ve done anything wrong			0
it has changed my life and i ’m not going to say sorry for that			0
’ the 27 - year - old believes the operation has saved the @entity6 money in the long term , claiming it would have cost more money to treat her for depression			1
she said : ‘ after my first child my stomach never went back to its normal size			0
‘ then after my third child i began to suffer from a condition where my stomach muscles had separated from my bulge			0
‘ it had started making me feel really down and i ’m not going to apologise for getting it done			0
’ but campaigners were outraged at the decision to fund the operation when cuts are being made elsewhere in the @entity6			1
a spokesman for @entity97 said : ‘ it ’s ridiculous that the @entity6 pays for procedures that are not based on strict medical needs			1
‘ patients missing out on vital drugs and treatment will find this deeply unfair			0
’ however , miss @entity15 hit back at her critics , saying she deserved the operation and would urge other woman to follow the same path			1
she said : ‘ i only did it after i became desperate and knew that i would n’t be able to afford it			0
‘ i hated feeling depressed and now i ’m a lot happier and can go out more without feeling self - conscious			0
‘ i do n’t make the decisions about who does and does not get surgery – that ’s up to the doctors			2
so it ’s not my fault if people with other conditions are not getting treated properly			0
‘ i would tell other women to go for it because there is no point feeling down about stuff and you can get it sorted on the @entity6			1
’ at first doctors recommended physiotherapy and exercise for @entity131 to improve the appearance of her stomach but she claims it did not work			0
eventually , she was referred to a surgeon			0
the three - hour operation to remove the excess skin on her abdomen was carried out at @entity139 last month			0
she said : ‘ it ’s only been a few weeks but i feel great and my friends have said the same			0
it ’s a great confidence boost			0
’ in another case earlier this year , @entity7 , 23 , told how she had £ 4,800 worth of breast enlargement surgery on the @entity6 in january after complaining she had been bullied over her ‘ flat ’ @entity11 chest			1
but after undergoing the operation , the aspiring model from @entity147 said her 36dd breasts had made her the target of online abuse			0
miss @entity7 then said she would like a reduction and compensation			1
she claimed she was not properly consulted before the operation and wanted compensation for clinical negligence and emotional distress			0
miss @entity7 , who works in telesales , consulted no - win , no - fee lawyers so she can ‘ take [ @entity160 ] for every penny ’ .			1
