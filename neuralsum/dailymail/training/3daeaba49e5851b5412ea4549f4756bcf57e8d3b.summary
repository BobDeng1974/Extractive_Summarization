some of cinema 's most famous lines are not what you think they are - the words have become commonly recited misquotes as they are endlessly repeated by fans			1
from cinema classics @entity10 to @entity11 and @entity12 , characters ' lines have been slightly altered over the years , meaning they are no longer remembered in their original form			1
one misquote from an early @entity17 film has become so ingrained in cinema lore that it was used as the title of another movie			1
however , @entity33 's evil stepmother @entity34 actually says something else entirely			1
instead of : ‘ @entity37 on the wall , ’ the queen says : ‘ magic mirror on the wall			2
’ the signature quote from another children ’s favorite , @entity11 , is also frequently misquoted			1
when @entity45 lands in @entity46 , most movie - goers believe that @entity48 's character turns to her little dog and says : ‘ @entity50 , i do n't think we 're in @entity51 anymore			2
’ @entity52 : when @entity54 believes @entity53 has killed his father , @entity53 corrects him , but not using his name			1
the correct line is : ' no. i am your father ' @entity11 @entity60 : ' @entity50 , i do n't think we 're in @entity51 anymore			1
' line : ' @entity50 , i 've a feeling we 're not in @entity51 anymore			2
' @entity10 @entity60 : ‘ if you build it , they will come			1
’ line : ' if you build it , he will come			2
' the empire strikes back @entity60 : ' @entity54 , i am your father			2
' line : ' no. i am your father			0
' @entity12 @entity60 : ' do you feel lucky , punk ? ' line : ‘ you 've got to ask yourself one question			0
do i feel lucky ? well , do ya , punk ? ’ if fact , the line that appeared in the script actually runs : ‘ @entity50 , i 've a feeling we 're not in @entity51 anymore			0
’ set not far from @entity51 in the state of @entity91 , @entity10 , the @entity87 - nominated 1989 film starring @entity24 , @entity88 and @entity89 , is another commonly misquoted movie			1
most people think that the character @entity94 , played by @entity88 , tells @entity24 ’s @entity95 : ‘ if you build it , they will come			0
’ in fact , the line is something slightly different : ‘ if you build it , he will come			0
’ @entity88 is also behind another of cinema 's most common misquotes when he provided the voice for @entity53 in @entity52 : @entity52			1
a slightly raspier version of @entity88 's voice is often believed to say : ‘ @entity54 , i am your father			0
’ actually , @entity88 ’ character @entity53 says : ‘ no. i am your father , ’ when @entity54 mistakenly accuses the character of killing his father			0
in @entity114 , @entity113 does n’t say : ' do you feel lucky , punk ? ' when he makes his final approach to an injured criminal as is commonly believed			0
instead , the line goes : ‘ you 've got to ask yourself one question			0
do i feel lucky ? well , do ya , punk ? ’ which might be a good question to ask yourself the next time you feel inclined to quote from your favorite movie script			0
@entity11 : when @entity45 lands in @entity46 , most people believe she said : ' @entity50 , i do n't think we 're in @entity51 anymore			1
' if fact , the line runs : ' @entity50 , i 've a feeling we 're not in @entity51 anymore			0
' @entity12 : the famous line from @entity113 's 1971 film ' do you feel lucky , punk ? ' is actually erroneous			0
