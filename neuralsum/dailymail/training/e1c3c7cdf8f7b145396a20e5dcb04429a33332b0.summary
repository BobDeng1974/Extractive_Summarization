by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 leads at the halfway stage after a thrilling second round of the @entity5 but worryingly for the revitalised @entity7 a familiar deadly foe has appeared in his rear view mirror			1
@entity9 was well off the pace but a marvellous finish of three birdies in his last four holes for a second successive 67 has left him just two shots behind			1
@entity9 and @entity2 has been a recurring theme this summer , of course , with the outcome to this point always the same			1
during the first two legs of his unforgettable treble , @entity9 defeated @entity2 to claim the @entity21 at @entity22 and then the @entity23 at @entity24			1
behind you : leader @entity2 has @entity9 in the chasing pack now the pair could be set for another fabulous shootout this weekend			1
not that the pair have things all their own way			0
sandwiched between them is @entity34 @entity33 who shot a wonderful 64 of his own , while another home player @entity35 is tied with @entity9 for third place			1
these two have a bit of history themselves , since they fell out during the @entity41 when @entity9 took exception to the extrovert @entity35 during just a bit too much whoopin ’ and hollerin ’			1
happily , they have since made their peace			0
if he ca n’t win this title himself for the second time in three years , @entity9 would probably be the first to hope @entity2 gets over the line			1
his brilliant form this summer is certainly deserving of a victory and you can see him being an absolute star once more at the @entity53 at @entity54			0
driver : @entity2 hits his tee shot on the 12th hole in @entity58			1
what a joy it was to watch him dismantle this storied old layout at @entity62 with a consummate demonstration of craft and imagination for a six under par round of 64			2
even when he played the odd bad shot – his second to the par five 17th finished in the water – he saved par with a majestic pitch that finished just inches from the hole			1
he had some deserved good fortune as well , most notably at the par four seventh where his second shot from 128 yards finished in the hole for an eagle two			1
the 34 year old also had four birdies			2
‘ it ’s just been one of those summers where i ’ve had some good breaks and holed shots like that one , so it has been great , ’ said @entity2			2
‘ obviously it would be wonderful to win a title as prestigious as this but there ’s still so much golf to play before i can think about that			0
i ’m looking forward to the challenge , though			0
contending for titles is where you want to be			0
’ charge : @entity9 finished with three birdies in his last four holes @entity9 drove the 346 yard par four opening hole and birdied the third but thereafter his round appeared to be drifting nowhere			1
at the 10th he flew the green from 127 yards and gave his caddie @entity97 a thunderous look			0
all was forgiven over a closing stretch that was the exact opposite of his opening round , when he had registered a couple of sloppy late bogeys			0
how often during this sublime summer for the 25 year old have we seen him respond to events on the leaderboard , and close the gap just when he needed ? it began when he rolled in a 30ft putt at the par three 15th and continued with an even longer effort at the 16th			2
at the par five 17th he took full advantage of his extraordinary length to find the green in two and two putted			2
‘ i ’m a lot happier with this 67 than i was after yesterday ’s , ’ said @entity9			2
‘ it meant a lot to finish so strongly and it has left me in a very good position			0
’ tied fifth is masters champion @entity121 while @entity122 , another of the boys of this summer , is only five behind			0
alongside him are three more sharp shooters who could certainly make a run at the lead this weekend – former world number one @entity127 , @entity34 @entity128 , and @entity130 @entity129			0
@entity132 champion @entity131 is six off the pace on two under with @entity134 on level par after a 71 .			0

@entity2 leads at the halfway stage on eight **-** under **-** par
@entity9 finished with three birdies in his last four holes
@entity35 tied with @entity9 for third place on six under
