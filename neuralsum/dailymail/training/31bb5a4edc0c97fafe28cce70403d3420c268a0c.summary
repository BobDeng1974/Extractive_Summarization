@entity1 @entity0 a @entity3 perched on a stump in @entity6 woodland @entity7 is a small village eight miles south - east of @entity10 and , when naturalist @entity0 moved there 13 years ago , the population numbered just 244			1
yet that simple statement is wholly deceptive — for what are a few human households compared with the teeming world of plant , insect , bird and animal life that also inhabits the area ? at the end of this series of @entity22 , @entity0 supplies complete lists of the species he has recorded in his parish : fungi , plants , slugs , snails , millipedes , spiders , grasshoppers , butterflies , moths , micro-moths ( yes ! ) , beetles , flies , ants , bees , wasps , fish , reptiles , birds and mammals			2
like a geek i started to count them all , then abandoned the task			0
but it wo n’t come as a surprise to any gardener to know there are 11 sorts of slugs and snails			0
@entity0 finds fascination and majesty , if not beauty , in everything			2
in light of what we know about how species are threatened , this @entity6 richness might seem miraculous — yet there is more to this story than numbers			2
@entity7 is a beautifully - written account of one man ’s passion for the natural world , a collection of precise , monthly observations , but also subtle warnings that unless we treat nature with respect , we will pay the price			1
in that context , the author ’s meticulous lists are a form of evidence			0
i have no doubt that , within 20 years , he and his friends will be checking to see what remains unthreatened			0
@entity0 has written nature columns for many years and locates the reader by his side on his walks through the @entity6 countryside @entity0 has written nature columns for many years , and while this is , in some ways , a collection of that journalism , it is much more			1
observations from different years are arranged month - by - month to build an overview of how the year turns in the author ’s beloved place			2
he explains : ‘ it is also a celebration of the way in which a particular location can give shape and meaning to one ’s whole outlook			0
’ so inspiring is this process , so completely does @entity0 locate you by his side on his walks , i confess that the few excursions outside @entity6 did n’t work for me ; you really do n’t want to be dragged from his @entity114 world to @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 or the @entity118 near @entity119			1
cooker describes the ‘ dog - like calls ’ of geese overhead and takes in his natural surroundings in perfect prose what you do want is imaginatively to stand beside him as ( in january ) he hears the ‘ dog - like calls ’ of geese overhead ( how precise that is ) and watches thousands of rooks roosting — recording their movements in masterly prose : ‘ and they fell earthwards , almost uncontrollably , so that they reminded me of some last bonfire of a lifetime ’s papers , each charred page rising , falling and twisting in a vent of boiled air			1
in march , he watched lapwings ‘ twist and rock crazily over the @entity147 ’ and their wild cries remind him of a beloved friend who has recently died			1
the joy he sees in the birds ’ movements has a profoundly healing effect			0
yet , @entity0 adds sadly , ‘ as a society we have yet to value truly or to find a means to harness fully ’ the succour the natural world can offer to human sorrow			1
@entity0 is mad about the humblest moth , views trees as infinitely generous in their gifts , marvels at the fact that jays plant 5,000 acorns every autumn ( for later retrieval ) and even counts the radials on a spider ’s web , calculating that she had linked her silk lines 1,332 times to make the sphere			0
in march , he watched lapwings ‘ twist and rock crazily over the @entity147 ’ and their wild cries remind him of a beloved friend who has recently died his powers of patient observation are thrilling , and he lures you outside , wherever you live — that ’s his intention : ‘ my hope is that readers might be inspired to look more closely at their own immediate surroundings			1
’ he is no sentimentalist			0
on the contrary , he rages against ignorance and neglect			0
noting that half our thrushes have gone in the past 30 years , he asks : ‘ why are we so complacent about our loss of wildlife ? what price should we put on the song thrush ’s priceless song ? how dare we not make that song a political issue ? ’ do politicians care about our wildlife ? he thinks not — which is why i ’d give every mp this exceptional book in their @entity203 stocking .			2
