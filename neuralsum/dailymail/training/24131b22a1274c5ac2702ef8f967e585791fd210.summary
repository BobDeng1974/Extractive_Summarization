a public welcome home celebration featuring @entity3 - winning singer @entity2 in honor of freed pow @entity5 in the tiny town of @entity7 , @entity0 was abruptly cancelled today			1
the official reason given was a concern for public safety , but @entity11 has learned that it was not the only reason the party was scrubbed			1
today 's decision follows a row that erupted in @entity7 between mayor @entity16 and @entity18 platoon commander @entity17 , who lives in @entity7			1
but the public party scheduled for june 28 has been cancelled @entity5 is back : but he has become a lightning rod for controversy as some , including people in his hometown , believe he is an @entity18 deserter - or worse and @entity17 was n't the only towns person who voiced disapproval of a celebration for the soldier under fire			1
mayor @entity16 wanted to throw a welcome home party for @entity5 , who has been released after five years as a @entity43 hostage			1
but since claims of @entity5 ’s alleged desertion in @entity48 and the political fallout surrounding his return , the mayor ’s office has been inundated with calls and emails in opposition to the plans			2
the army tank platoon commander weighed in and said a public ceremony to celebrate @entity5 ’s return would be a ‘ monstrous profanity ’			2
in an email to mayor @entity16 - seen by @entity11 - former @entity18 platoon leader @entity17 said : ‘ if individual members of the community wish to hold sedate , private celebrations to commemorate @entity5 's homecoming , they are of course free and welcome to do so			1
it would be , however , a monstrous profanity if a public ceremony , financed by public money , were to be held			2
‘ it would be more monstrous still if this ceremony were to , in any way , heap undeserved adulation on @entity5 , or to adopt the sickly hue of ostentatious jingoism that all too often colors such occasions			0
’ @entity17 , 30 , said the fact that @entity5 has been repatriated ‘ is an unambiguously positive development ’ , adding that he shares the community ’s ‘ relief ’ that @entity5 will be reunited with his family			2
but he said : ‘ i do , however , think it is incumbent upon members of this community to come to terms with the fact that , while one town will soon be reunited with a native son , there are six other towns scattered across this country that never will be			1
’ @entity17 is referring to the six soldiers later killed in @entity94 , @entity48 believed to be in connection with attempts to rescue @entity5			0
no party : @entity98 in @entity7 , @entity0 , where the ' @entity5 is @entity100 ' celebration of @entity5 's release , now canceled , was scheduled for june 28 , 2014 never forgotten : a plaque marks four trees that have been planted at @entity98 in @entity7 , @entity0 , to commemorate each anniversary of @entity5 's captivity safe return : the four trees in the forefront have been planted at @entity98 in @entity7 , @entity0 , to mark each year since sgt. @entity5 's capture children 's playground : the trees planted to commemorate the capture of sgt. @entity5 stand in front of a play zone for children in @entity7 , @entity0 the pros : ' past celebrations have focused on bringing this soldier home			1
regardless of the character of the men and women who choose to serve , we do not leave our soldiers behind , ' said the town 's mayor @entity16 and the cons : @entity18 platoon leader @entity17 ( fourth from left ) says , ' until he is cleared of the charges against him , this man deserves no applause ' he added : ‘ until he is cleared of the charges against him , this man deserves no applause			1
for now , the only appropriate response is silence			0
’ mr @entity17 served in the @entity18 as a platoon commander from 2009 - 2013 , during which he was posted to @entity138			2
he is now an executive at a recruiting firm in @entity140			0
in response to @entity17 ’s email mayor @entity16 replied : ‘ past celebrations have focused on bringing this soldier home			1
regardless of the character of the men and women who choose to serve , we do not leave our soldiers behind			0
‘ you have to remember that @entity5 's family also are a part of our community			2
i have known @entity154 for thirty years			0
‘ from my standpoint , our celebration will focus on @entity5 's release and the relief of his family and those who live here			2
‘ again , from my standpoint , any celebration exists separate and apart from any objective inquiry on how @entity5 was captured			0
’ @entity163 : @entity5 is back , but not everyone wants to welcome him @entity17 feared that an annual event called ' @entity166 ' that was scheduled for june 28 would now be the venue for the welcome celebration			1
the event was quickly renamed by locals as ' @entity5 is back '			0
' it is going to be @entity5 's official welcome - home party even if he 's not quite home yet , " organizer @entity174 said on the weekend before it was canceled			1
@entity3 winner @entity2 was on tap to sing and @entity5 ’s parents @entity154 and @entity179 were due to talk at the event at @entity181 in @entity7			1
the event , which normally attracts 10 - 15,000 people , was include a motorcycle ride from @entity185 , to @entity0 and a @entity186			0
@entity5 , 28 , had been held prisoner by the @entity43 since june 30 , 2009			0
