if you 've ever wished you had a recording of incriminating audio - or had a permanent record of your own witty comeback - a new @entity6 app , billed as the app that allows users to ' capture audio after you 've heard it ' could be the answer			1
the app , called @entity14 , records everything the @entity6 microphone picks up on a constantly rotating five - minute loop			1
if something happens that you want to keep a record of , 30 seconds , two minutes , or even five minutes later , you can go into the app and press ' save '			2
do nothing , and the app erases the audio			2
always listening : with the click of a button , users can save audio recorded up to five minutes beforehand once opened , the app continues to record audio even when running in the background , albeit with a large red banner warning the user the software is operating			1
in this era of surveillance , some are suspicious of the recording device			0
in comments made about the app on @entity42 , people were wary			0
' there is absolutely no good reason for this app , ' wrote @entity46			0
' anyone who downloads it and does n't expect that they 're being listened to is a fool			0
' @entity50 commented , ' silly me , i thought the @entity52 already had that app on everyone 's phone			0
' another comment noted that recording people without consent is illegal in many places			0
' many states have laws prohibiting recording of conversations without the express consent of those being recorded			0
look for @entity66 coming to a town near you , ' wrote ' @entity69 '			0
testing , testing : the new @entity73 app is slightly more practical for recording audio than traditional recording devices critics have also questioned how the app is different from the @entity6 's inbuilt recording device , which like @entity14 can run in the background , and the app 's makers point to its five - minute recording loop			1
with the buffer , the user saves only the recordings they deem important , rather than saving all audio in one long , interminable file			2
same but different : the @entity6 's inbuilt audio recorder ( left ) records in a long stream , as opposed to @entity14 's five - minute recording loop once recorded , clips can be named , tagged , emailed , or shared on @entity94			1
the app 's homepage pronounces : ' with @entity98 installed on your @entity6 , you have a powerful time - shifting app that lets you grab that otherwise missed audio			1
' the heard app runs silently ( and seamlessly ) in the background and - with a push of a button - the instructions / driving directions / jokes / stories / first words / laughter you would have previously missed are now captured and available on your @entity6			2
' @entity14 launched late last week with a free version of the app that allows users to record 12 seconds of audio			1
for the full version with five - minute recording capability , the cost is $ 1.99 .			1

a new @entity6 app called @entity14 records everything the @entity6 microphone picks up on a constant five - minute loop
users can elect to save important audio , or the app will *automatically* erase data more than five minutes old
a free 12 - second recording version of the app is available ; the full version costs $ 1.99
