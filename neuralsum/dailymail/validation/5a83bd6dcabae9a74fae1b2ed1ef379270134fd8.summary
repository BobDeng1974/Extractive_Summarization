the only word i can use to describe my feeling over the last few days is distraught , really			2
the night we lost to @entity4 i found myself staring at the floor in disbelief and i was trying to work out in my own mind what happened			1
then over the next couple of days it started to sink in and the disappointment turned to anger			2
it was in our hands and the players have to take every bit of heat we get because we were in a very winnable position in that game			2
we just did n’t take to the pressure well at all			2
what went wrong ? it ’s tricky as players to try to offer an explanation because it can sound like an excuse			2
did we lack a bit of experience ? you look at the big teams here at this @entity31 and most of the players have played a lot more one - day internationals than us			1
there ’s always a temptation to call for change at times like this but my gut feeling would be to keep this group of players together to get them that experience over the next four years before the next @entity31			1
we do n’t play as much one - day and @entity45 cricket as others because of our schedules but we have to find a way to be honest so we can get that experience			1
you learn how to win games in tricky positions and the pressure of winning a game for @entity54 is completely different to doing it for your county			1
@entity57 ( bottom ) lays on the floor during @entity54 's @entity31 pool a defeat to @entity4 on monday do n’t blame the coach it ’s unfair to pin the blame on @entity64			1
we ’ve worked a lot on our game and the coach ca n’t do anything about the players not being able to take the heat of the battle when it most matters			2
coaches try to teach that but you only really get it by winning and losing at the highest level			2
i ’m reading a book called @entity80 by @entity81 and a lot of what he says applies to cricket			2
it ’s about players taking responsibility to get into a position to handle the pressure			2
there was no reason why we could n’t have beaten @entity4 on that flat wicket at the @entity93			1
no reason why we should n’t have been able to chase 275			2
@entity54 coach @entity64 ( left ) has come under strong criticism for their early @entity31 exit below my best it ’s stating the obvious to say i have n’t taken the amount of wickets i would have liked in this tournament but it ’s never the definitive way to judge how you have bowled			1
i like to judge myself on the processes , whether i ’ve hit the right areas and whether i ’ve created chances			2
i feel like i have created chances but i ’ve not hit the right areas as consistently as i ’d like to have done			0
at the start of the tournament i tried to bowl as quickly as i could but found i was n’t moving the ball as much as i ’d like			0
so against @entity4 i changed that and tried to bowl a bit more as if it was a @entity115 and looked for movement			1
that was better but it took me too long to figure it out in these conditions			0
i ’ve not been happy with myself but it ’s such a shame it ’s been cut short because there ’s a lot of cricket left in this tournament			0
this group had a lot more expectation than we ’ve shown but hopefully a lot of them will be around to grow over the next couple of years			0
@entity57 admits he has n't been happy with his productivity levels in terms of taking wickets at the @entity31 the obsession with statistics i really do n’t know where that has come from			1
it ’s completely wrong to say we are obsessed with statistics or over-analyse things			0
in my eight or nine years of @entity54 touring this trip has seen fewer meetings than ever before			1
there ’s also been the least number of stats flying around			0
if you are winning then people say you are fantastically prepared if you have good analysis but if you ’re losing it becomes something to take aim at			0
if you want information on your game or an opponent ’s then it ’s available to you but we have n’t had anything thrown at us			0
the fast bowler adds that despite talk of stats there have been fewer team meetings than ever before moving on it ’s still very raw going out of this @entity31 at this stage and that frustration and anger is still there			1
i ’m disappointed with how i played and i ’m sure all the guys feel the same			0
it ’s natural and if those feelings were n’t there you would have to ask questions			0
i feel embarrassed to be honest			0
another book i read recently was @entity178 ’s and he ’d say that if @entity179 lost on a saturday when he played he ’d be embarrassed to leave his home on a sunday			1
that ’s how i ’m feeling right now but games and challenges come round so quickly that you have to pick yourself up as soon as you can			0
we ca n’t afford to sulk			0
@entity57 says @entity54 ca n't afford to sulk on their @entity31 disappointment with a busy fixture list ahead a one - day future i ’m only 28 and i want to continue playing one - day cricket for @entity54			1
look at the best teams here and they all have experience in their teams			0
i ’ve not shown enough quality in this tournament but the next @entity31 is in @entity54 and my record is good at home			1
you ca n’t say what ’s going to happen in the next four years but i ’d certainly like to play a key role leading up to the next one			1
they say a bowler ’s peak is from 28 to 33 so why would n’t i want to play ? i know we are the only team who plays all - year round and that means a lot of cricket but i try to give myself the best opportunity i can to play for @entity54 as often as i can			1
i rest where possible and i have n’t been to the @entity213			0
that ’s because i want to play for @entity54 and i want to keep on doing that in all forms			1
at 28 , @entity57 ( right ) aims to play in the next @entity31 for @entity54 which will be on home soil a modern approach we ’ve got the players to produce the modern brand of cricket we are seeing in one - day cricket , of course we have			1
look at people like @entity226 , @entity227 and @entity228			0
it ’s just that we have n’t delivered it here			0
those guys will have a significant number of one - day caps when they play in the next @entity31 and that will give them more expertise and more confidence			1
we must make sure that we accept it if guys like those get out at times playing the modern way and someone like @entity244 can definitely bat as fluently at the top of the order as some of the players we have seen at this tournament			0
he just has to be backed to do so			0
i think the right 15 players were in this @entity31 squad and we can only look at ourselves as to why we have n’t justified the faith placed in us			1
it will take a long time to get over what ’s happened here it is what it is and if we do n’t learn from it that will be criminal			0
there is a lot of exciting cricket ahead and that has got to be our focus now			0
@entity57 says @entity227 ( right ) is an example of the modern brand of one - day cricket @entity54 has to stick with			1

@entity54 lost to @entity4 by 15 runs in their @entity273 *clash* on monday
defeat meant the @entity276 could n't qualify for the *quarter* - finals
@entity57 aims to play in the next @entity31 which will be on home soil
