by @entity0 , science correspondent published : 19:57 est , 29 october 2013 updated : 22:33 est , 29 october 2013 a new drug created from @entity2 by a @entity4 researcher could provide months of pain relief @entity2 , best known for smoothing out wrinkles , could also help soothe the pain of cancer , arthritis and migraines – without any side effects			1
sufferers of chronic back pain and women who have given birth by caesarean section could also benefit from the ‘ @entity19 ’ jab			2
a single injection could provide pain relief for months – removing the need for patients to take several daily doses of powerful tablets – and it could be injected into any part of the body			1
charities said the drug , invented by a researcher at @entity4 , could revolutionise the treatment of pain			1
the main ingredient of the @entity2 used to prevent wrinkles is a bacterial poison known as botulinum			1
it works by preventing nerve cells from talking to muscles , which in turn stops muscles moving and wrinkles developing			0
it can also stop pain signals from being transmitted for months at a time			0
however , fears that it will paralyse the area being treated have prevented it from being widely used for pain relief			0
to get round this , @entity4 researcher professor @entity51 took the pain - relieving part of @entity2 and ‘ stapled ’ it to a friendly part of a similar poison produced by the tetanus bug			1
the tetanus toxin ferries the pain - reliever to the spinal cord , where it stops pain signals being sent to the brain			1
the professor said : ‘ in effect , we engineer pain relief by taking only good parts of toxic molecules			1
’ animal trials have had encouraging results and , if large - scale trials on people are successful , the drug could be on the market in as little as three years			0
professor @entity51 designed the drug while working at the @entity78 in @entity79			1
painkiller : the new ' @entity82 ' drug could help treat sufferers of chronic pain ( file photo ) he said : ‘ currently painkillers relieve lingering pain only temporarily and often have unwanted side - effects			2
an injection of this new molecule at the site of pain could potentially relieve pain for many months			2
’ and he added that a public which is willing to have injections for cosmetic purposes would not be squeamish about receiving medicine in the same way			0
migraine sufferers are likely to be the first to benefit			0
normal @entity2 can already be used as a treatment for crippling headaches , but fears that it will paralyse the face mean that many sufferers miss out			2
' an injection of this new molecule at the site of pain could potentially relieve pain for many months ' - professor @entity51 , @entity4 cancer patients would also be high on the list as the side - effects of powerful painkillers such as morphine can be unbearable			1
drugs widely used to ease the pain of arthritis can raise the risk of heart attacks and around one in five people who have a major operation are left in pain for several years			0
professor @entity51 , who reports his research in the journal @entity129 , hopes the drug will cost around £ 1,000 a year , making it cheap enough for use on the @entity133			1
@entity134 , of @entity135 , said : ‘ alongside developing new treatments for cancer , finding new and better ways of controlling pain is very important			0
‘ if this new approach proves to be effective and have fewer side effects , it has the potential to be extremely useful to cancer patients and others with chronic pain			0
’ dr @entity147 , a neurologist , is a trustee for charity @entity148 and chairman of the @entity150 for the @entity151			0
he said : ‘ this sounds interesting and innovative , and if successful in what it is meant to achieve may revolutionise the way we currently treat pain and other neurological disorders			0
’ many a-list celebrities , including @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163 , have admitted having @entity2 in the past .			2
