x-ray images of an unopened cardboard box have revealed a treasure trove of @entity4 tins sent to @entity6 soldiers on the @entity7 100 years ago			1
a collector , who bought the unremarkable - looking box at auction on a hunch it may contain gift tins , did n't want to damage the box by opening it			1
so instead , he decided to x-ray it - with the scans revealing hundreds of tins stuffed with goodies such as chocolate , cigarettes and sweets inside			1
during the war , the tins were made in their thousands then shipped off by the @entity26 to soldiers fighting in the trenches over the first @entity4 of the war in 1914			1

the five - inch long tins were paid for by the @entity43 - a nationwide appeal for donations organised by @entity45 ’s daughter @entity44			1
it is thought that more than 355,000 were sent to troops in 1914 , although due to the pressures put on the postal service some soldiers did not get theirs until 1916			1
by the end of the war the fund had raised £ 200,000 and had sent out 2.5 million boxes			2
mystery surrounds the box for sale , which was bought by a collector of @entity67 memorabilia several years ago after he spotted it at auction			1
the collector , who was told the box had been found in @entity71 , suspected the box had @entity4 tins inside so had it x-rayed as he did n't want to open it			1
inside : the collector , who bought the box at auction on a hunch it would contain the tins , did n't want to open the box - so he had it x-rayed ( pictured ) to see what was inside @entity84 treats : the scan showed the box was stuffed to the brim with the @entity4 gift tins , pictured , which contained a @entity4 card , sweets and chocolate it will be opened for the first time by @entity94 , great - grandniece of military great lord @entity95 , at the @entity97 near @entity98 , @entity99 , later this month			1

@entity110 , from @entity105 auction house in @entity112 , said : ' with christmas 1914 approaching , @entity45 ’s daughter @entity44 came up with the idea for a fund which would pay for presents for soldiers and sailors fighting on the front lines			2
100 years : the box will finally be opened later this month by @entity94 at the @entity121 in @entity98			1
a number of the tins will be auctioned off for £ 300 - £ 350 during the event - with the proceeds going to charity at the start of the conflict , @entity6 soldiers were allowed 10oz of meat and 8oz of vegetables per day			2
however , this was soon reduced as supply lines were disrupted due to naval and land blockades across @entity135			0
two years later in 1916 , the meat ration was down to 6oz a day			2
towards the end of the conflict , soldiers were lucky to get meat once every nine days			0
some sources suggest the troops ate horse meat from animals killed on the front line			0
some soldiers reportedly grew their own vegetables in the trenches - but few were successful			0
instead , nettles and weeds were used in stews			0
other goods provided included tea , bacon , cheese , jam and meat stews - all of which were tinned			0
flour was scarce also , so ground - up vegetables were used as a substitute			0
in terms of equipment , every soldier was issued with a @entity167 for carrying personal items			0
it included : a wide belt , left and right ammunition pouches each stocked with 75 rounds and an entrenching tool head			0
a water bottle carrier , a small haversack - including a knife and unused rations - and large pack were also supplied			0
a mess tin was contained inside a cloth buff - coloured khaki cover			2
' she had wanted to do her bit and the campaign was very successful			0
' it was common belief that the war was going to be very quick and so hundreds of thousands of these little tins with gifts inside were put together			1
' it was meant to be a one off but as we know now the war lasted a lot longer than anticipated			0
' the fund continued to grow and so the boxes were sent to others helping the war effort such as young soldiers and nurses			0
' there were a few types of box - the initial ones contained a packet of cigarettes and a pencil made from a shell casing while others got sweets and chocolate			1
' the box was found in @entity71 but we do n’t know any more about its history			2
' it is a complete mystery as to whether this box was simply surplus to requirements or if there is another reason why it never made it to the front line			0
' its seal is still intact which would suggest it has never been opened which is incredible in itself because the tins potentially have packets of cigarettes in them			2
' the box has been x-rayed and it confirms these are the tins with the shell cartridge pencils inside			1
' it is amazing to think they have spent the last 100 years undisturbed			1
' @entity97 runs from june 23 to 29			0
the box will be opened on june 28 .			0
