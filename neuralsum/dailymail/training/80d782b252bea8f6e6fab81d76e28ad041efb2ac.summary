prompts could be printed on nappies in a bid to remind parents to talk to their babies more often under new proposals being discussed by a government - owned organisation			1
the @entity7 , also known as the ' nudge unit ' are to consider the plan , which would see parenting tips written on nappies			1
the idea was discussed during a recent meeting of the @entity13 in @entity14 , which was attended by the team 's chief executive officer dr @entity15			0
a new proposal has suggested that parenting tips could be printed on nappies to remind parents to talk to their babies as they change them in a blog post he revealed how the idea was discussed in a meeting of the international council of behavioural policy makers , which talked about family ideas			1
he wrote : ' on parenting and families , probably the most left - field proposal was to prompt parents to talk to their kids by printing messages on nappies			1
' he added that the proposal would now be worked on by the team in the @entity32			1
after the meeting , the @entity13 published an article saying that parents should talk to their babies while changing their nappy to help them develop and improve their language skills			2
the @entity13 article said many parents stay silent when changing nappies as they are too focused on the task in hand they add that small prompts could remind parents to chat to their children beacuse many remain silent as they concerntrate on the task in hand			1
the article said : ' add a note on the front of the nappy encouraging parents to ' look up ' and ' talk to your baby ' or to narrate what they are doing as they change the nappy			0
' small prompts like these may be just enough to remind parents that every second , a baby 's brain develops 700 new neural connections and that this is a good time to help make those connections stronger			2
' recent studies have shown that mothers and fathers who hold a conversation with their babies are actually teaching them to speak more quickly			2
researchers found new mothers who respond enthusiastically to their baby ’s babbling are helping to speed up the child ’s language development			1
@entity72 academics at the @entity73 ( @entity73 ) and @entity74 , said the evidence shows that speaking to infants at a very early age is vital			0
meanwhile a separate study has recommended that babies should hear at least 21,000 words a day to help aid their development			0
however , the plan has divided parenting experts with some praising the ' creative idea ' and others branding it as invasive			0
dr @entity86 from @entity88 healthcare group told the @entity89 : ' the more ways of getting positive messages out to parents the better			0
' but dr @entity93 from the @entity94 at the @entity95 added : ' you 've got plenty to think about when you 're changing a nappy			0
