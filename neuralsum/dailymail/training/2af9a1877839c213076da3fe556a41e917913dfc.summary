by @entity0 published : 10:48 est , 19 august 2013 updated : 11:16 est , 19 august 2013 the dj behind this year ’s biggest dance craze claims he has n’t earned a single cent from the track because of legal issues arising from not having properly cleared samples with the original artists before it was released			1
@entity11 - based @entity10 ’s track ‘ @entity12 ’ achieved global recognition in february when it became the soundtrack to a series of memes posted on @entity17 of people dancing wildly to the song			1
the ‘ @entity12 ’ quickly became an internet phenomenon inspiring a raft of other clips of people doing the crazy dance in any number of bizarre situations – in an old folks home , while carrying out @entity28 army drills , while filming a @entity30 commercial			1
the viral success helped push download sales of the song , which charted at number one for five consecutive weeks on the @entity41 @entity53			2
it also reached number three in the @entity56 and number one in both @entity58 and @entity59			0
but now @entity10 – real name @entity60 – has spoken out about the downside of having such an unexpected smash			2
the 24 - year - old dj and producer created the track in his bedroom and since he was n’t planning for such a runaway success he did n’t seek clearance from the two artists who he sampled without permission			1
@entity72 ! : a group of @entity28 soldiers line up in a neat square formation seconds later , the soldiers - who are suddenly wearing skis and standing on their heads - do the crazy dance is this the new @entity80 ? in a new video craze , one person - in this case supermodel @entity83 - is seen dancing unnoticed to @entity12 shake with style : when the bass line drops , everyone in the frame forms a wild and chaotic dance party			1
here , models @entity91 , @entity83 and @entity92 whip their hair to the catchy tune even though the track had been around since may 2012 , it was only after it had gained global success , that @entity10 and his record label - @entity100 - received lawyer 's letters on behalf of the sampled artists - reggaetón artist @entity102 and @entity104 rapper @entity103			1
now despite record label boss @entity105 having previously said that an agreement had been reached to clear the samples , @entity10 has said he is still waiting to be paid			2
‘ i ’m meeting with my lawyer tomorrow for lunch , so i ’m gon na find that out ( why he has n't been paid )			0
i think it ’s mostly because of all the legal s * * t , ' he told @entity113			0
' i did n’t clear the samples because i was in my f * * * ing bedroom on @entity116			0
i was n't going to think to call up [ @entity102 ] , i did n’t even know who it was who did that [ sample ] ; i knew the @entity103 [ sample ]			0
so i found myself in that f * * * ing pickle			0
legal letters and s * * t. ' @entity125			0
so exposure-wise it was fantastic , but everything else ... , ’ he told them			0
while @entity10 may not have received any money yet from downloads of his track , it certainly has helped to further his reputation and will undoubtedly have helped raise the fee he charges for appearing at clubs and music festivals			2
gentle gyration : a @entity30 model begins to boogie unnoticed by the rest of the cast and crew ... dance party : seconds later , the whole cast and crew join in , with the exception of the underwater camera man hula shake : in a video posted by @entity152 , the rapper starts by hula - hooping to the beat of the song rhythm : when the beat comes in , a dancing crowd appears in the room , and the rapper - suddenly wearing a marching band outfit - busts a move in the centre of the group video : speedo models do the @entity12 video : the @entity28 army does the @entity12 video : @entity91 , @entity166 and @entity92 do the @entity12 backstage at @entity168 video : @entity152 does the @entity12 video : @entity169 does the @entity12			1

@entity10 claims he has n't earned a cent from creating the track which was number one for five weeks earlier this year
' @entity12 ' soundtracked the internet dance craze of the same name
the 24 - year - old @entity177 is attempting to *settle* legal *disputes* with two artists he sampled and did n't get clearance for before its release
