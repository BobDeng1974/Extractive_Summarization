demand : an official organ transplant			2
the first illegal ' organ harvesting ' in @entity2 was reported in 2011 two people – one a boy as young as 12 – have been smuggled into @entity2 to have their organs removed and sold on the black market			1
the horrific cases , which have been revealed in an official report , show the lengths to which human traffickers will go to make money from their vile trade			2
the pair were brought into the country last year by gangs seeking to exploit the worldwide demand for transplant organs			0
one was identified as a boy aged between 12 and 15 and the other as a woman in her 30s			1
they are thought to have started their journey in @entity25 or @entity26 and to have been rescued by @entity2 police or immigration officials who suspected they were being trafficked			1
such cases are rare , but expose what charities and campaign groups suspect is a little - known aspect of international people - smuggling			1
the first incident of illegal ‘ organ harvesting ’ in @entity2 was reported in 2011			1
two years later a girl was brought from @entity39 with the intention of removing her organs and selling them on to patients desperate for a transplant			0
the two latest cases are revealed in a report by the @entity46 , which was set up by the government to combat serious and organised crime			0
according to the @entity50 ( @entity50 ) , as many as 7,000 kidneys are illegally obtained by gangs each year around the world			2
while there is a black market for hearts , lungs and livers , kidneys are the most sought - after organs because one can be removed from a patient without serious ill - effects			1
the conspiracy involves a number of people , including a recruiter who identifies the victim , someone else to organise their journey , medical professionals to perform the operation and an accomplice charged with offering the organ for sale			2
while the vast majority of trafficking cases highlighted in the @entity46 statistics relate to sexual exploitation and modern - day slavery , ‘ organ harvesting ’ is specifically identified as a category of cross-border criminal activity			1
vigilant : border police at @entity84			0
immigration officials suspected the pair were being trafficked and they were rescued the @entity87 was awarded a government contract in 2011 to give specialist support to victims of all forms of people - smuggling , including providing them with safe houses as well as medical care and legal advice			1
@entity97 , the @entity87 ’s human trafficking response co-ordinator , said : ‘ front - line staff are becoming more aware of the different types of exploitation that are taking place and the extremes to which gangs will go to make money from their victims			2
‘ the woman who was found in 2011 and referred to us had not yet had an organ removed but she was completely traumatised and very frightened			1
‘ she had suffered an awful ordeal and was in such an emotional state that she found it difficult to talk about what she had been through			0
it is almost impossible to imagine anyone even thinking of carrying out a complicated operation in secret without the necessary medical back - up			0
the cases highlighted by the @entity46 are a truly shocking development			0
’ @entity123 , from child protection charity @entity121 , said : ‘ we know of just a handful of cases but we suspect these are the tip of the iceberg			0
organ harvesting is prevalent in many countries			2
we have felt confident in the @entity2 that we have robust systems and procedures in place in relation to transplants but this could be something that is happening underground and out of view			1
‘ traffickers target the most vulnerable – children , those living in poverty , refugees and migrants – because they are often desperate and easy to manipulate			0
’ the demand for organs outstrips supply in almost every country			0
in many places the wait for an organ can be measured in years			0
the @entity50 says around ten per cent of the 63,000 kidney transplants carried out annually worldwide involve payment of non-related donors of different nationalities			1
@entity156 , clinic director , was jailed for eight years after heading an organ - trafficking ring that performed at least 24 illegal kidney transplants on the outskirts of @entity160 , in the former @entity162 republic of @entity163 globally , at least 200,000 people are on waiting lists for kidneys , and many more have no access to transplantation or dialysis services			1
one of the worst cases uncovered so far was in the former @entity162 republic of @entity163 , where five men were convicted in 2013 of involvement in an organ - trafficking ring that performed at least 24 illegal kidney transplants at a clinic on the outskirts of the capital , @entity160			1
the clinic ’s director @entity156 , who was sentenced to eight years in jail , had promised victims about £ 12,500 each for kidneys that were then sold on the black market for as much as £ 84,000 a time , but donors often went unpaid			2
prosecutors at the trial said they were ‘ cast aside at the airport ’			0
most of the organs were sold to recipients in @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 and @entity191			0
according to the @entity50 , a heart can fetch up to £ 1 million on the black market and a pancreas or liver about £ 500,000			0
a spokesman for the @entity197 , which regulates organ transplants in the @entity2 , said : ‘ we have been made aware of these two cases			1
fortunately , the authorities were able to intervene before the traffickers could carry out their plan			0

a 12 - year - old boy and a woman in her 30s started journey in @entity25 or @entity26
they were rescued by police who suspected they were being trafficked
