@entity1 teams envied @entity3 's giants			1
now @entity4 are poor relations @entity6 now knows what it is like to be an @entity10 manager			1
he is suffering from the same issue that affects his contemporaries from these shores : familiarity			2
breeds contempt , you know			2
that ’s why whenever an @entity10 - born manager ’s name is put forward for a job , the phone - ins and message boards come alight and folk armed with a hundred negatives discuss the candidate ’s uselessness			1
a foreign name , not so much			1
a poll in the @entity29 on tuesday suggested 97 per cent of @entity31 fans would be happy if @entity32 got the job			1
that ’s a bad result for @entity34			2
yet @entity34 was well regarded at @entity35 by sir @entity36 , won a trophy and got @entity38 to a @entity40 final , won the league in @entity42 and is doing an excellent job at @entity44			1
he is clearly a talented coach			2
@entity32 ( centre ) got the seal of approval from @entity31 fans in a local newspaper poll the problem is we know too much			1
we know that he failed to get @entity53 to the @entity54 in 2008 , that @entity38 ’s @entity56 run had more than an air of good fortune , and that he lost a play - off final with @entity44 last may			2
we know every flaw and mis - step			2
it is not the same with @entity63			2
the odd @entity65 football obsessive aside , what we know is what we read : a record four consecutive @entity69 titles with @entity70			2
but it ’s a line in a c.v			2
we do not have intimate knowledge of @entity63 ’s career			2
we might catch @entity70 in the odd @entity77 tie , or on a highlights package , but we do not know every nuance or twist in the plot			0
did @entity70 have more money to spend than their rivals ? were they already well set up when @entity63 inherited the team ? did other teams have complications , injuries or money issues ? and why are @entity70 now trailing @entity90 by six points ? for all we know , @entity34 ’s title win at @entity93 may be regarded as a greater achievement than a manager claiming another prize for mighty @entity70			1
no @entity10 manager will ever get a 97 per cent approval rating coming into a job because we have familiarity , and @entity102 is suffering from that now			1
former @entity53 manager @entity34 led unfashionable @entity93 to the @entity65 title back in 2010 he arrived at @entity35 as a genius because of his work at @entity70 , @entity107 and @entity108 — some of the greatest clubs in the world			1
yet we only have half an eye on those games — we hear @entity102 is top of the league again and the excellence of his performance is presumed			0
we thought the same of @entity117 at @entity108 last season — right up until the moment his team were swept aside by @entity120			0
that one tie did n’t make @entity117 a failure — but it did demonstrate that no manager stands up to incessant scrutiny			1
not even the very best			0
now we are watching every minute of every game , it turns out @entity102 is human , too			0
his team ca n’t break down @entity128 away ; his defence is unconvincing ; he is not getting the best out of @entity131 and @entity133 ’s first season is inconsistent ; occasionally , of late , his record has been compared questioningly with that of @entity135			0
a @entity137 manager would be under siege by now — with every past mistake and failing exhumed and examined for clues			1
@entity6 commiserates @entity141 after @entity35 were held to a 0 - 0 draw by @entity128 when @entity135 took over from @entity36 , he did so dragging a whole heap of baggage			1
we knew he had never won a trophy , or managed beyond the qualifying round of the @entity77			0
we knew his @entity149 teams had a reputation for caution and that he was not renowned for his decisiveness in the transfer market			0
so when the odd flaw appeared , it was instantly seized upon , the critics armed with a filing cabinet of prior knowledge			0
at @entity159 , @entity135 has the benefit of being the foreign coach			1
few will have studied @entity149 ’s games , or even seen much of what went on at @entity35			1
they will have been sold a c.v			0
that showed @entity149 as perennial relegation candidates when he took over , and as a strong , established club near the top of the table when he left			0
they wo n’t have all the footnotes and clarification available to an @entity10 football fan			0
go back to 2000 and @entity176 was hailed as a master tactician , on the back of his record at @entity180 and @entity181			0
it turned out he liked the ball chased into the channels and was as married to 4 - 4 - 2 as any son of @entity186			0
@entity176 was heralded as a tactical genius on his arrival in @entity53 from @entity189 would he get the same offer now ? no , because we know him			0
we ’ve seen that he fell short with a gifted group at the 2004 @entity193 , we ’ve witnessed his subsequent work at @entity195 , @entity196 and @entity197			0
he ’s not a mystery any more			0
neither is @entity200 , nor @entity201			0
they all flew in , though , with reputations far in advance of their @entity10 counterparts , and levels of indulgence that would never be afforded a local			0
the record suggests @entity102 will get it right at @entity31			1
@entity63 would no doubt make a very good manager of @entity31 , too			1
but so , quite probably , would @entity34 — yet while one has an approval rating of 97 per cent , the other barely registers			1
there can not be so many @entity29 readers with inside knowledge of @entity70 ; but plenty of us are willing to take the same test on @entity219 , @entity220 or @entity44			0
we know about the managers at those clubs			1

@entity6 finding *things* tough at @entity35
@entity32 backed by 97 *%* of @entity31 fans to be their new manager
foreign managers always held in high esteem before they arrive
