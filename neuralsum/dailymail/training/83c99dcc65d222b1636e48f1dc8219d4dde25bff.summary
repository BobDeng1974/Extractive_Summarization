contrary to previous belief , the latest research by astronomers suggests star systems with planets are actually the norm across the cosmos			2
and the analysis only includes planets in close orbits around certain kinds of stars , meaning the massive estimate they have offered could yet be doubled			1
@entity30 , assistant professor of planetary astronomy at the @entity32 ( @entity32 ) , called the estimate ' mind boggling '			1
' there 's at least 100 billion planets in the galaxy — just our galaxy , ' he said			2
@entity40 , a postdoc student at @entity32 and lead author of the paper due for publication in @entity44 , added : ' it 's a staggering number , if you think about it			1
basically there 's one of these planets per star			2
' astronomers at @entity32 made their estimate by analysing planets orbiting a sun called @entity56 which , they say , is representative of the vast majority of stars in our galaxy			1
that system , which was detected by @entity65 's planet - hunting kepler space telescope , contains five planets , the existence of two of which had already been confirmed by other astronomers			1
the @entity32 team confirmed the remaining three , then analysed the five - planet system and compared it to other systems found by the @entity56 mission			1
the planets orbit an m dwarf star — also known as red dwarfs , this type accounts for about three - quarters of all stars in the @entity5			1
the five planets , which are similar in size to @entity83 and orbit close to their star , are also typical of the class of planets that the telescope has discovered orbiting other @entity89 , @entity40 says			2
therefore , the researchers concluded , the majority of planets in the galaxy probably have characteristics comparable to those of the five planets			0
habitable zones : these are the regions of space around a star where conditions are favourable for life as found on @entity83			0
this @entity65 graphic shows how the region is closer or further depending on the type of star the region of the @entity5 where @entity108 points : each rectangle indicates the specific region of the sky covered by each ccd in @entity56 's photometer			1
there are a total of 42 ccd elements in pairs , each comprising a square other teams of astronomers have already estimated that there is roughly one planet per star , but this is the first time researchers have made such an estimate by studying m - dwarf systems			1
but their analysis only considers planets that are in close orbits around m dwarfs — not the outer planets of an m - dwarf system , or those orbiting other kinds of stars			1
while @entity56 may not be unique , what sets it apart is its coincidental orientation : the orbits of the planets lie in a plane that 's positioned such that the @entity56 space telescope views the system edge - on			1
thanks to this rare orientation , each planet blocks @entity56 's starlight as it passes between the star and the @entity56 telescope			0
by analysing changes in the star 's brightness , the astronomers were able to determine the planets ' characteristics , such as their sizes and orbital periods			2
this orientation offered an opportunity to study the system in great detail , and because the planets represent the vast majority of planets that are thought to populate the galaxy , the system also can help astronomers better understand planet formation in general			2
' i usually try not to call things " @entity173 stones " , but this is as close to a @entity175 as anything i 've seen , ' said professor @entity30			0
' it 's like unlocking a language that we 're trying to understand — the language of planet formation			0
' as a result , they say , their estimate is conservative			0
in fact , says mr @entity40 , a more accurate estimate that includes data from other analyses could lead to an average of two planets per star			1
m - dwarf systems like @entity56 's are quite different from our own solar system			0
for one , m dwarfs are cooler and much smaller than the sun. @entity56 , for example , has half the mass of the sun and half its radius			0
the radii of its five planets range from 0.8 to 2.7 times that of @entity83 , and those planets orbit extremely close to their star			0
the whole system fits within just over a tenth of an astronomical unit ( the average distance between @entity83 and the sun ) — a distance that is about a third of the radius of @entity216 's orbit around the sun. the fact that m - dwarf systems vastly outnumber other kinds of systems carries a profound implication , according to professor @entity30 , which is that our solar system is something of a cosmic ' weirdo '			2
but although the planets in m - dwarf systems orbit close to their stars , it does not necessarily mean that they 're fiery , hellish worlds unsuitable for life , the astronomers say			1
indeed , because m dwarfs are small and cool , their temperate zone — also known as the ' habitable zone , ' the region where liquid water might exist — is also further inward			0
even though only the outermost of @entity56 's five planets lies in its temperate zone , many other m dwarf systems have more planets that sit right in their temperate zones			0
the implications of a galaxy chock full of planets are far - reaching , the researchers say			0
' it 's really fundamental from an origins standpoint , ' said mr @entity40 , who noted that because m dwarfs shine mainly in infrared light , the stars are invisible to the naked eye			0
' @entity56 has enabled us to look up at the sky and know that there are more planets out there than stars we can see			0

analysis only includes planets in close orbits around certain kinds of stars - meaning that estimate could yet be doubled
astronomers at @entity32 came up with the *stunning* figure from an analysis of data from @entity65 's @entity108
