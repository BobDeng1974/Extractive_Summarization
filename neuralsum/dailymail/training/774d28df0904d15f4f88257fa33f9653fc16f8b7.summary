by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 10:30 est , 1 october 2012 updated : 02:38 est , 2 october 2012 shadow defence secretary @entity2 said that once the @entity3 had resolved its problems ' the time for the referendum will be upon us ' a referendum on @entity13 ’s membership of the @entity14 should be held once the @entity16 crisis is over , a senior member of @entity10 ’s frontbench team said today			1
@entity2 , the shadow defence secretary , claimed ‘ almost everyone ’ in the @entity18 would campaign for @entity13 to stay in the @entity14			1
there are growing signs of that @entity18 could still a march on the conservatives and promise to hold a vote on the @entity14 after the next election			1
last night @entity25 , the shadow foreign secretary , insisted there was ‘ almost total unanimity for @entity13 ’s continued membership in the @entity14 ’ in the @entity18			1
however , some senior @entity18 figures are understood to be unenthusiastic about the prospect of having to defend a @entity32 bureaucracy which they believe is bloated and runs counter to @entity13 ’s interests			1
@entity35 , who is leading @entity18 ’s policy review , last week said he would examine the case for an in / out referendum			1
but former leader @entity39 described the prospect of a referendum as ‘ a gigantic distraction ( which ) would disable political and economic activity in the rest of the @entity14 ’			2
however , other senior members of the @entity18 frontbench now think such a vote is inevitable			1
mr @entity2 today told @entity53 's @entity52 show : ‘ i think at some point , there will have to be a referendum on the @entity14 ... i do n't think it 's for today or for the next year , but i think it should happen			1
’ he appeared to be agreeing with @entity57 , who last week suggested the @entity16 will be smaller after the single currency had resolved its problems and settled on a new political and fiscal deal			0
@entity2 ( left ) yesterday joined shadow chancellor @entity61 for the annual @entity18 vs @entity63 football match mr @entity2 said : ‘ i think after that , the time for the referendum will be upon us			1
‘ i do n't have a calendar with a date circled			0
i think we will do it when the time is right			0
‘ my preference would be an in - or - out referendum when the time comes			2
‘ whenever the referendum comes , almost everyone in the @entity18 , along with the @entity77 and @entity13 business , will be arguing we should stay part of the @entity14 , because it is good for our economy and good for @entity13			1
’ however tonight the party tried to play down mr @entity2 's remarks			1
a senior @entity18 source said : ' no one can fully predict where @entity85 will be in a few months ' time , nevermind a few years ' time			1
' so @entity18 is very clear on this			2
this is not a decision we could or should sensibly make now			0
' the issue of @entity85 is expected to dominate the @entity91 next week			0
the @entity13 @entity92 has offered to form an electoral pact and not challenge @entity95 @entity91 mps at the 2015 election , but only if mr @entity97 commit to a referendum ‘ in blood ’			0
the same deal could apply yo @entity18			2
in interviews last week the prime minister @entity97 hinted that he might be ready to call an @entity14 referendum after the 2015 general election			0
he said that the coming years would see ‘ opportunities for a new settlement between @entity13 and @entity85 ’ which would require ‘ fresh consent from the @entity13 people ’			0
@entity109 leader leader @entity108 said today : ' first it was the @entity111 offering the @entity13 people consent on the never - never			2
now we see @entity18 doing much the same			2
' it wo n't wash			0
poll after poll shows that we want a say , we want it now , and we want it on a simple , transparent question			0
' the political elite are running scared of public opinion on our relationship with the @entity14			0
muddying the waters , writing promissory notes about what might happen in 10 years ' time , is no longer acceptable			0

shadow defence secretary @entity2 says once the *eurozone* crisis has passed , the ' time for a referendum will be upon us '
growing signs that @entity18 could steal a march on the @entity111 and promise an in / out referendum
but some senior party figures are *reluctant* to be seen to be defending a bloated @entity32 bureaucracy
