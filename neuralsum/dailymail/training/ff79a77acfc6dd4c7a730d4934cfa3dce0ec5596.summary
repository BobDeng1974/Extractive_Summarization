a mother who is dying from cancer begged her council to let both her sons attend the same primary school - but had her request denied because she lives 100ft outside of the catchment area			1
@entity7 , who was diagnosed with skin cancer in 2008 which has since spread all over her body , fears her family will struggle to cope with the strain of doing two school runs every day			1
her eldest son , nine - year - old @entity14 , already attends @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17			1
' extremely close ' : @entity14 , nine ( left ) , and @entity19 , six ( right ) , currently both attend @entity15 primary school in @entity16 , @entity21 refused : @entity7 , right , was told that her two sons can not go to school together			1
she is pictured with her husband @entity24 her younger son @entity19 , six , currently attends the attached infants ' school , but despite appeals to @entity29 he will not be allowed to move			1
instead he will be forced to attend @entity30 , which is even further away from the family 's home in the town			0
mrs @entity7 and her husband @entity24 , who are both 37 , faced a gruelling appeals process from the council , who asked invasive questions about her cancer treatment and made mr @entity40 feel as if he were ' on trial ' for questioning their decision			1
mrs @entity7 fears the boys ' ' extremely close ' relationship will be but under strain if the two are separated			1
she said : ' @entity19 and @entity14 support each other , they ’re there for each other a lot			1
' they ’re aware of my illness and symptoms and are very sensitive at the moment			0
i ca n’t face putting @entity19 in another school			1
' split apart : the strain of taking @entity19 , left , and @entity14 , right , on separate school runs could put serious strain on the family , mrs @entity7 fears mrs @entity7 claims the council ’s ‘ rules are rules ’ attitude forced her to struggle on buses and on foot to do two separate school runs as her health deteriorated			1
she fell ill shortly after @entity19 was born in 2008 and doctors confirmed a mole on her leg was malignant melanoma			2
the deadly skin cancer spread to her groin and she required surgery and radiotherapy to bring the disease under control			1
but the cancer has now spread to her brain , kidneys , lungs , liver and lymph nodes and since falling ill she has had four brain tumours removed , which means she can not drive			2
an appeal hearing with an independent panel dashed mrs @entity7 ’s hopes of her ‘ extremely close ’ boys being able to attend the same junior school			1
she said : ' they made @entity24 feel like he was under investigation , they were asking a lot about my health			0
' when @entity24 told them i ’d received treatment for brain tumours , they would ask : " well what treatment exactly are you talking about ? "			0
' they were extremely intrusive			0
he felt a bit like he was on trial - their attitude was really awful and it was basically rules are rules			0
it was like talking to a brick wall			0
’ mr and mrs @entity7 plan to write to education secretary @entity113 , whom they will ask to intervene and allow their sons to attend school together			1
mrs @entity7 said : ' we ’re hoping we can get the decision overturned			2
@entity19 is constantly asking whether we ’ve got him a place at the junior school			1
' his friends have had trial days and he ’s missed out and with this on top of my illness , he ’s very tearful			0
' it ’s just very , very difficult			0
i am fighting for my life but i am determined to fight for the boys to be together			0
together : both boys wish to attend @entity15 junior school , where @entity14 currently is			1
but @entity19 's appeal has been rejected ' sometimes i ca n’t walk , i have severe joint pain and nausea - the symptoms are similar to chemotherapy			1
' i do n’t know when they are going to strike so the boys are like my little carers			0
they ’ve had to grow up a bit quickly which is quite sad			0
' mr @entity40 used to work in investment banking , but gave his job up after his wife ’s diagnosis			0
he now works for @entity147 , allowing him more flexible hours to help take care of his wife and children			0
mrs @entity7 said : ‘ @entity24 is brilliant			2
he carries all the weight on his shoulders and tries to be strong all the time but it does get to him			0
' the whole thing is so unnecessary , it ’s just extra stress and pressure			0
' a spokesman for @entity29 said : ' while we are unable to comment on individual cases , we can confirm that there was a recent appeals committee which reviewed several cases			2
' the county council presented its case that @entity15 can not take more than 33 children in each of its year 3 classes entering in september 2014			2
' each family at the appeal presented their case for exceptional circumstances			2
' the panel reviewed and made the decision that this particular case has been dealt with by @entity29 appropriately			2
' we have been very sympathetic to this case			0
those involved have gone beyond what is required to assist and support the family and we will continue to work with them			0
' strain : mrs @entity7 says doing separate school runs will put pressure on the family			1

@entity7 , 37 , has an advanced form of skin cancer which has spread
she begged @entity29 to let her sons go to school together
but *authorities* denied appeal on *behalf* of @entity14 , nine , and @entity19 , six
the pair want to go to @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17
but ' intrusive ' appeal hearing decided against them
now family must do two school runs , putting them under extra strain
