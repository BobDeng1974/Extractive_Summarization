hundreds of thousands of patients are languishing for more than 24 hours in @entity1 before being seen , according to figures by the care watchdog			1
the most seriously ill are lying on trolleys waiting for a bed on a ward while others are forced to wait just to be assessed and sent home			0
a survey of almost 40,000 patients by the @entity11 found that a third spent at least four hours in @entity1 – the government 's target			1
if the @entity11 's findings are representative of the 22 million patient visits in a year , as many as 650,000 people will wait at least 24 hours in @entity1 ( file picture ) of that third , 6 per cent were there for at least 12 hours and 3 per cent for 24 hours or more			1
if the @entity11 's findings are representative of the 22 million patient visits to casualty in a year , as many as 650,000 will wait at least 24 hours			1
the watchdog 's findings come as emergency wards across @entity27 are facing unprecedented pressures , with many urging the public to stay away unless they are very seriously ill. several hospitals are on black alert in which operations are cancelled to free - up beds and ambulances are diverted elsewhere			0
@entity35 mp , @entity36 's @entity35 , said : ' these figures will alarm people about what lies ahead in the coming months			0
' a&es were telling patients to stay away before winter even started			2
under this government , over a million patients every year wait too long to be seen in @entity27 's a&es			2
hospitals have missed the waiting time target for 71 weeks in a row as more and more patients wait hours on end			1
' this should have been ringing alarm bells in the @entity52 months ago , but the truth is ministers failed to listen and act on concerns			0
' the figures also show that 13 per cent of patients waited at least half an hour for pain relief after asking a nurse for help			1
of that , 8 per cent were given no help at all			2
some 11 per cent of patients who arrived by an ambulance had to wait outside for at least 30 minutes because the casualty department was too busy			2
this included 5 per cent who were stuck in the vehicle for an hour – and 2 per cent for two or more hours			1
the @entity11 has also named and shamed the ten worst @entity1 units based on the responses of patients			1
they include @entity73 , in @entity74 , where a damning report by the watchdog last week revealed how patients were spending 35 hours on trolleys			1
the survey is undertaken every two years and the results are broadly similar to 2012 , although some questions differed slightly			0
some 80 per cent rated their overall experience in @entity1 a score of 7 out of 10 or higher , a rise from 76 per cent two years ago			1
and 77 per cent said doctors and nurses listened to them , while 72 per cent said staff had enough time for them			2
professor sir @entity90 , chief inspector of hospitals at the @entity11 , said the overall results of the survey were ' encouraging '			2
' however , we do see significant variations between trusts , ' he said			0
' this highlights the need for all trusts to review their own results and to take action where necessary			0
' each of the 142 @entity1 units was rated based on patients ' responses and the @entity11 compiled a league table			1
the bottom ten included @entity108 in @entity109 , @entity73 in @entity110 , @entity74 , and @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 in @entity114			1
at the other end of the scale were @entity117 , the @entity118 and @entity119 in @entity109			2
each of the 142 @entity1 units was rated based on patients ' responses			1
the bottom ten included @entity108 on @entity109 ( pictured ) patient numbers in @entity1 have risen by 50 per cent in a decade partly due to an aging population and a lack of gp availability			1
health secretary @entity125 revealed last week how he had taken one of his children to casualty because he did not want to wait to see a family doctor			0
@entity130 , of @entity131 , said : ' its horrendous			0
the problem is that people can not see their gp , and this is just rebounding up the system			0
but it 's an untenable situation and there just does n't seem to be a solution			0
' dr @entity140 of @entity27 , which campaigns for patient rights , said there is ' clearly room for improvement '			0
