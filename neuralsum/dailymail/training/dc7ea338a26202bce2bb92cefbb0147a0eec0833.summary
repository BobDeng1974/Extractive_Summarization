by @entity0 follow @ @ draper_rob in some ways the goal against @entity2 was better			1
the initial control is even more delicate , as the ball never bounces but remains airborne , there is an extra touch , guiding the ball around @entity9 and he uses both feet			1
the point was once put to @entity12			2
which was better , he was asked ? the goal against @entity2 or the goal against @entity16 ? @entity12 did n’t hesitate			1
‘ @entity16 , ’ he said			2
the reason ? ‘ because it was the @entity19 quarter - final			1
’ context is everything when judging great goals and @entity12 has a long list of contenders up for discussion : this one , though , was definitely the greatest			1
but the reason for being a professional footballer is to perform on the biggest stage in front of a global audience			0
you are judged on how you perform there , under the most extreme pressure			0
and in that isolated moment against @entity16 , @entity12 was sublime			1
given that @entity51 has been criticised in @entity27 for his departure from @entity54 ’s @entity53 , it is worth recalling that @entity27 ’s finest piece of skill at the @entity19 finals came from a long ball			1
or a long pass , as @entity60 would put it			0
from @entity62 ’s 50 - yard pass , which was from within his own half , @entity12 somehow controlled the ball immediately , delicately bringing it down with a touch			1
but that is just the first of three moments of exquisite football			0
the second is the switch in body shape to touch the ball onto the ground and swivel past @entity28			2
floored genius : @entity12 lies on the floor after his wonderful strike ended @entity16 's @entity19 hopes mobbed : @entity12 is grabbed by @entity76 and @entity77 after his wonder strike @entity79 : @entity27 highlights ‘ after the second touch i know this ca n’t go wrong , ’ said @entity12 , though plenty of ordinary footballers could n’t vouch for that quite as certainly			1
good as his word , the finish , leaving goalkeeper @entity29 no chance , formed the third part of a moment of aesthetic beauty			1
‘ you ’re in that moment , ’ said @entity12 later			2
‘ that ’s the feeling			0
after the first two touches … that moment ! it ’s like your life has led up to this moment			0
’ it was n’t just that magnitude of the game that elevated the goal			0
@entity27 had been down to ten men , with @entity103 having been sent off , and @entity12 was n’t even playing well			1
in fact he should n’t have even been playing at all , give that he had stamped on @entity106 ’s @entity105 in the previous round , an act of aggression the referee had missed			0
early lead : @entity111 fired @entity27 ahead in the 12th minute with a typically instinctive finish inside the box level pegging : @entity114 fired @entity16 level six minutes later after outwitting @entity116 @entity16 looked the more likely winners when , on 87 minutes , @entity118 advanced into the @entity120 penalty area and took on @entity121 before falling to the ground			1
the referee was not deceived , no penalty was awarded and as @entity116 walked over to berate the @entity125 for diving , @entity118 jumped up , directing his forehead at the @entity120 goalkeeper ’s chin in a head butt			2
@entity118 was off and suddenly it seemed the match had been equalled up with ten against ten for extra time			0
except that , 53 seconds after the re-start following @entity118 ’s red card , @entity12 ’s strike was landing in the back of @entity16 ’s net			1
on the back foot : @entity103 ( no 5 ) is sent off after receiving his second yellow card of the game losing his head : @entity116 falls to the ground after being headbutted by a wild @entity118 a game which had been slipping away from @entity27 had turned on a minute of frenzied action			2
‘ i do n’t think you can ever play a perfect game , ’ said @entity12 once , before being reminded of that goal			2
was n’t that perfection ? ‘ yeah , ’ conceded @entity12			0
‘ that moment is perfection			0
’ but perfection never lasts			0
@entity27 went out on penalties to @entity154 in their semi-final three days later			0
@entity156 hopeful of @entity158 fitness			0

the @entity120 *maestro* 's magnificent winner against @entity16 16 years *ago* remains one of the great @entity19 goals
he controlled the ball perfectly , turning @entity167 before firing a *glorious* shot past @entity29
@entity12 rates it as the best strike of his career - better than the beauty against @entity2 at @entity38
it is *ironic* that the finest piece of skill from @entity27 , the nation of @entity53 , at the @entity19 finals came from a long ball
