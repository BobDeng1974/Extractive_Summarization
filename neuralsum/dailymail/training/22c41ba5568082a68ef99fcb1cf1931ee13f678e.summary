by @entity0 published : 15:20 est , 5 july 2012 updated : 01:58 est , 6 july 2012 @entity1 last night caved in and backed @entity2 plans for @entity3 to investigate the banking scandal instead of a judge - led public inquiry			2
following the most bad - tempered commons debate for decades , party leader @entity6 reluctantly agreed , for now , to back a probe headed by senior mps and peers , though he insisted it would be ‘ inadequate ’			1
ministers offered a significant concession , saying a cross-party joint committee of both houses of @entity3 would be given resources to hire a @entity17 who could either advise on the questioning of witnesses , or even conduct it			1
mps last night voted for a @entity32 probe into rate - fixing balls insisted @entity1 would continue to press for a broader judicial probe @entity36 chief executive @entity35 praised his former bank as he appeared before mps earlier this week the government and the opposition have been arguing for days over the nature of an inquiry into the rate - fixing scandal that has engulfed @entity45 ’s banks , and lessons to be learned about the wider culture and practices of the finance industry			1
@entity1 lost a @entity51 vote calling for a judicial probe , on the lines of that led by @entity55 into the media , but agreed to cooperate with a more rapid parliamentary inquiry after mps voted in favour of that instead			2
however , shadow chancellor @entity24 insisted @entity1 would continue to press for a broader judicial probe to follow - warning the government that if future banking scandals emerged it would be blamed			2
chancellor @entity22 and mr @entity24 were involved in venomous exchanges as they debated the issue			2
mr @entity22 challenged mr @entity24 to say who were the ‘ @entity1 ministers ’ who raised concerns with the @entity69 about the high rates being declared by @entity71 on how much it was paying to borrow at the height of the financial crisis			1
the bank has been fined £ 290million for fiddling the libor rate - the rate at which banks borrow money from each other - forcing its chief executive @entity35 to quit			1
‘ do you know who those ministers are ? ’ the chancellor demanded , as deputy commons speaker @entity84 struggled to maintain order			1
‘ let him explain what @entity1 ’s role was			2
who were the ministers , who had the conversation , who were the senior figures ? ’ mr @entity22 asked , saying mr @entity24 had to ‘ answer for his time in office ’ as @entity1 ’s city minister			1
@entity71 has been fined £ 290m for fiddling the libor rate - the rate at which banks borrow money from each other			1
@entity100 , @entity35 , who was forced to quit , addresses @entity102 @entity35 passes protesters waving monopoly boards as he leaves after giving evidence to the @entity102 at @entity106 , central @entity107 the chancellor mentioned a report called ‘ @entity110 ’ drafted by bankers at @entity112 and circulated in @entity113 by @entity114 , then a cabinet office minister , in 2008			1
the peer , who was one of @entity119 ’s closest economic advisers , has admitted commenting on the report but denied having any conversation with the @entity69 about getting the rate down			0
mr @entity24 denied any involvement and claimed mr @entity22 ’s ‘ cheap , partisan and desperate ’ conduct ‘ demeans the office he holds ’			1
he complained that the chancellor had ‘ impugned my integrity ’ and demanded an apology			0
‘ if he has any evidence , he should produce it			0
he should either push up or shut up , ’ mr @entity24 said			0
the chancellor retorted : ‘ the idea that i am going to take lessons in integrity from the man who smeared his way through 13 years of @entity1 government , who half the people who ever served with him think he was a disgrace in his post is another thing			0
’ @entity144 mp @entity143 asked mr @entity24 : ‘ can you confirm that in your time in office , no other minister either in @entity148 or the @entity102 spoke to the @entity69 on @entity110 that you know about ? ’ clutching two bottles of @entity151 ' bankers ' appear outside @entity3 yesterday in a tongue in cheek protest about greed in the financial services sector the @entity129 did not answer directly , telling him : ‘ the reason why we advocate an open , public inquiry , judge - led , is to get precisely to the bottom of all these things			1
’ mr @entity22 said it was ‘ completely fanciful ’ for @entity1 to suggest a judge - led inquiry could produce a report that would be completed in time to inform banking reform legislation due early next year			1
since the @entity172 was passed in 2005 , only one judge - led investigation , into an explosion at a @entity171 plastics factory , had been completed in under two years , he told @entity173			0
‘ the idea that a widespread , judge - led public inquiry into the culture and professional standards of @entity45 ’s largest industry is going to take place much quicker than a public inquiry into the explosion at a plastics factory in @entity171 i think is just fanciful , ’ mr @entity22 said			2
‘ it just leads me to believe that the @entity1 wants to put off the moment when we actually investigate what happened			0
’ attorney general @entity187 , the government ’s most senior lawyer , prompted further confusion as he warned criminal charges against bankers could hamper either a judge - led or a parliamentary inquiry			0
‘ it could present such a difficulty , ’ he told mps			0
treasury select committee chairman @entity197 , who the government has selected to run the inquiry , had threatened to pull out unless there was cross-party support			0
a @entity1 source said mr @entity197 was an ‘ honourable man ’ but claimed his inquiry would be ‘ incredibly limited ’ in scope			2
@entity205 , head of the @entity206 , yesterday criticised the @entity69 over its handling of the rate - rigging scandal			0
‘ i do n’t know what the @entity206 would have done but i hope we would have done better , ’ he said			0
‘ a lot of action should be taken to improve governance of the @entity110 process			0
’ a @entity102 source said all mr @entity22 had ever said about mr @entity24 specifically was that he had questions to answer , insisting that was ‘ undeniably the case ’			1
