one volunteer is the proud of owner of what is thought to be the first tattoo etched by a machine - a perfect circle on his forearm some people perceive tattoos to be a unique work of art on the skin , etched by skilled artists but now a group of students have modified a 3d printer to prove that robots can tattoo humans too			1
one volunteer is the proud of owner of what is thought to be the first tattoo etched by a machine â€“ a perfect circle on his forearm			2
a group of three @entity24 design students modified a @entity26 3d printer as part of a challenge set by @entity24 's @entity29 , which challenged people to remix images and sounds in the public domain			1
the event was hosted by @entity35 , a famous design school in @entity36 and the students set about creating tattoos from a bank of images			1
@entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 had eight hours to make use of their digital materials and managed to hack the printer so that it could draw a perfect circle on skin , using a normal pen			1
they chose the circle to demonstrate the precision of the technology as however good a human tattoo artist is , circles are incredibly difficult to draw accurately			0
despite the official challenge being over , the students were determined to create their tattooing machine for real			0
they borrowed a manual tattoo - machine from an amateur tattooist and practiced getting the robot to etch the design on artificial silicone skin			2
the students explored different methods of holding the skin taut where the tattoo was planned , including a metal ring and elastic bands , but finally settled on a tube with an open area where the skin was to be marked			1
they did not find it hard to find a brave volunteer eager to gain the accolade of having the first robot tattoo			0
the @entity107 website documented the process in detail and has published the instructions to help people transform their own 3d printers into robotic tattooing machines			0
ready to go : the big difficulty was to get the machine to tattoo accurately on real skin - a curved and flexible surface ( pictured )			0
the students experimented with a number of ways of keeping the skin stretched taut and settled on a tube with an exposed patch where the tattoo was going to be			0

three students hacked the machine for a challenge set by @entity24 's @entity128 , hosted by @entity35 , a famous design school in @entity36
they first managed to get the 3d printer to draw a perfect circle on skin using a penand then modified it further to tattoo the skin permanently
the main challenge was holding the skin taut to draw an accurate circle - their tattoo design - which was chosen to show the machine 's accuracy
