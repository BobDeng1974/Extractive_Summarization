line them up : a new study has found that drinking beer could make people and animals smarter , but humans would have to drink 3,520 pints ( 2,000 litres ) of beer to stand any chance of booting their cognitive abilities - which the scientist 's do n't recommend flavonoids are compounds found in plants that often give them their colour and scientists have been studying them in blueberries , dark chocolate and red wine to uncover any potential benefits that could help fight cancer and heart disease , for example			1
scientists hope that xanthohumol could be used to treat metabolic syndrome , a condition associated with obesity and high blood pressure , as well as age - related deficits in memory			1
the rare micronutrient is found in the hops , commonly used to make beer			0
experts at @entity54 ( @entity54 ) believe they have taken a step to understanding the degradation of memory that happens with age in many mammals , including humans , because no effect was seen in older mice used in the study			1
a recipe for intelligence ? researchers have demonstrated that @entity67 – a type of flavonoid found in hops ( pictured ) and beer - improve cognitive function in young mice researchers have demonstrated that @entity67 – a type of flavonoid found in hops and beer - improved cognitive function in young mice			1

last week , hops - a key ingredient in beer - have been harvested from @entity88 's first hop farm in over 100 years			2
@entity90 's @entity89 is based in @entity91 on the banks of the @entity93 and the hops picked will be used to make a beer designed to reflect the taste of the capital - rather than scientific research			0
they studied xanthohumol in high dosages - beyond what would be naturally ingested as part of a normal diet - and found that it appears to enhance young animals ’ ability to adapt to changes in their environment			0
the cognitive flexibility of the mice was tested with a specially designed maze and younger mice showed signs of intellectual improvement			0
the levels of xanthohumol used in the study were only possible using supplements , so that if a human was to stand any chance of seeing positive cognitive effects , they would have to drink ‘ 2,000 litres of beer a day to reach the xanthohumol levels we used in this research , ’ the experts said			1
‘ @entity67 can speed the metabolism , reduce fatty acids in the liver and , at least with young mice , appeared to improve their cognitive flexibility , or higher level thinking , ’ @entity128 , a former @entity54 doctoral student said			2
‘ unfortunately it did not reduce palmitoylation [ a normal biological process ] in older mice , or improve their learning or cognitive performance , at least in the amounts of the compound we gave them , ’ dr @entity128 , who is now a lecturer at the @entity136 / @entity135 , added			0
@entity147 , a professor at @entity54 , said : ‘ this flavonoid [ xanthohumol ] and others may have a function in the optimal ability to form memories			0
’ ‘ part of what this study seems to be suggesting is that it ’s important to begin early in life to gain the full benefits of healthy nutrition			0
’ xanthohumol - in hops - is of particular interest because scientists think it would be used to treat metabolic syndrome , a condition associated with obesity and high blood pressure , as well as age - related deficits in memory			1
here , volunteers pick hops at the first hop farm based in @entity88 for over 100 years			0

researchers have demonstrated that @entity67 - a type of flavonoid found in hops and beer - improved cognitive function in young mice
scientists think xanthohumol could be used to treat metabolic syndrome - associated with obesity - as well as age - related deficits in memory
experts at @entity54 believe they have taken a step to understanding the degradation of memory that happens with age
levels of xanthohumol used in the study were possible using supplements - so a human would have to drink 2,000 litres of beer to see any effect
