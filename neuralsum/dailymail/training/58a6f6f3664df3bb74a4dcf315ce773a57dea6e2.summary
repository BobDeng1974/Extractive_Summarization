by @entity1 reporter it looks like a scene from a @entity5 movie - puppies , tortoises , fawns and zebras living together in harmony - but at the @entity11 it 's reality			1
the non-profit organization in @entity14 , @entity12 is home to as many as 60 animals at a time - and the wide range of species have grown into one big , loving family			1

among her long - term residents are cheesecake the capybara , crouton the @entity31 , barcode the zebra , butterbean the bull terrier and @entity34 the miniature horse			1
' @entity68 has a crate in the kitchen to sleep in and the dogs have taught him how to use the the dog door - so he soon became one of the pack , ' @entity69 says			2
' butterbean my bull terrier and ' chief nanny ' , sleeps with him and stays very close otherwise			0

' when they met @entity68 , they decided he would be a fun playmate , ' she said			0
' they got him running through the house playing chase with them and the rest of us can only get out of the way because that pig has no traction on my tile floors ! ' not letting sleeping dogs lie : a clutch of chicks and a friendly skunk interrupt these dogs ' nap times day out : barcode the zebra and some of the other animals take a stroll in the snow all smiles : cheesecake the capybara cools off in his paddling pool with one of his canine friends cute : cheesecake spends time with another fluffy pup at the refuge , which finds new homes for animals @entity69 , who studied social work and counseling before working as a technician for a veterinarian , set up the shelter to rescue and raise wildlife and sick pets after long caring for animals			1
among her former residents , she has raised a one - eyed llama , an orphaned @entity128 and a baby @entity129 with a fractured leg			2
most famously , she cared for @entity131 the @entity133 watusi steer - who grew to be the @entity136 holder for largest horn circumference			2
she launched a @entity139 page three years ago and her adorable photos became so popular that every year she now sells @entity11 calendars , which help raise funds			1
' i am a small , one woman operation and always have been , ' said @entity69 , who is able to carry out many of the medical treatments on the animals herself			2
nuzzling in : the shelter 's puppies show new addition @entity68 the @entity151 , pictured , the ropes together : barcode the zebra goes for a paddle with her fellow @entity11 animals inquisitive : crouton the @entity31 allows a new litter of puppies to introduce themselves tucking in : many of the animals , such as the puppies , are adopted but some animals , including the capybara and the tortoise , are long term residents at the sanctuary ' i will continue rescuing as long as i am able and hope to train someone to take my position when i can no longer operate as needed			1
' she hopes to continue raising funds through her website			0
' my mission has been to alleviate suffering more than anything , ' she said			0
' in a world with so much need , i know i ca n't save all and know the reality is that many die every day			0
