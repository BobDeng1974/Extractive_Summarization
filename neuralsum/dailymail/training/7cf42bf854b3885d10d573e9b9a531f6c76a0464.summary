with the word ‘ lunacy ’ tracing its roots to ‘ lunar ’ , it ’s been a common myth for centuries that a full moon causes higher levels of psychological problems and can result in a rise in crime or injuries			1
but the lunar cycle has no effect on our mental state - and full moon madness can be put down as legend , according to a patient study by psychologists at @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity22			1
they analysed 771 patients admitted to emergency wards over three years , in particular those with psychological problems , and found they were no more likely to come in during a full or new moon			1
full moon : the lunar cycle has no effect on our mental state , according to a hospital study by psychologists but medical staff said otherwise , with 80 per cent of nurses and 63 per cent of doctors convinced they saw more patients with mental health problems during a full moon than at any other time			1
researchers evaluated patients who visited emergency rooms at @entity47 in @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 in @entity51 , @entity49 , and linked their visits to lunar calendars			0
the scientists looked at patients who came in with mystery chest pains - and found a large number of those people suffered from panic attacks , anxiety and mood disorders , or suicidal thoughts			0
results showed there was no link between incidence of psychological problems and the four lunar phases , but anxiety disorders were 32 per cent less frequent during the last lunar quarter			0
institution : the research was produced by psychologists at @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity22 professor @entity74 from the university ’s psychology school said : ‘ this may be coincidental or due to factors we did not take into account			1
but one thing is certain			0
' one thing is certain - we observed no full - moon or new - moon effect on psychological problems ' professor @entity86 ‘ we observed no full - moon or new - moon effect on psychological problems			2
the analyses revealed no link between the incidence of psychological problems and the four lunar phases			0
’ the study was published in the @entity96 journal and professor @entity74 said she hoped the results would encourage doctors to stop linking the lunar cycle to mental illness			0
‘ this misperception could colour their judgement during the full moon phase ( or ) make them less attentive to psychological problems that surface during the remainder of the month , ’ she added .			2
