the flame was lit a week ago in @entity11 and flown to @entity12 for the @entity13 in @entity14			1
however , the glitch occurred when a torchbearer ran through a long passageway leading into the @entity18 which apparently created a wind tunnel , extinguishing the flame			1
@entity32 , president of the @entity14 organising committee , said on @entity34 that the problem was due to valve on the torch which had not been opened fully			0
the torchbearer , @entity38 , 60 , was a champion swimmer for the @entity40 who once saved 20 passengers from a bus that had fallen into a reservoir			1
he used his legs to break the back window of the bus as it lay in 10 meters ( 30 feet ) of water , and pulled out 20 of the 92 passengers @entity1 holds the torch with the @entity5 flame during a ceremony in @entity12 's @entity6 the relay will stay in @entity12 for the next three days and hundreds of athletes and public figures including @entity55 are to take part			1
the flame will then begin its journey across @entity2 , traveling from @entity59 to the easternmost point just across the @entity61 from @entity62 , before swinging back through the vast country to @entity14 in time for the opening ceremony on february 7			2
for most of the 65,000 kilometer ( 39,000 - mile ) trip , the flame will travel by plane , train , car and even reindeer sleigh , safely encased inside a lantern			0
but 14,000 torch bearers also will take place in the relay at the more than 130 stops along the way			0
@entity1 holds the @entity5 torch in @entity12 's @entity6 before it will embark on its tour young @entity2 figure skaters @entity80 , right , and @entity81 carry the @entity5 torch one of the silver and red torches , unlit , will be carried into space in november for a brief visit to the @entity86 , and this same torch will be used to light the @entity5 flame in @entity14			2
@entity1 , for whom the @entity5 are a source of personal pride , said the relay will ' show the world @entity2 as she is and as we love her			0
' the torch relay will pass through many cities that showcase the historical , cultural and ethnic richness of @entity2 , while other cities on the route are more closely associated with the evils of @entity104 , the harsh treatment of dissent under @entity1 or the @entity108 insurgency simmering in the @entity109 not far from @entity14 's ski slopes			0
as the relay crosses the expanses of @entity114 , it will put the spotlight on @entity2 's immense wealth of natural resources and the rusting of its industrial towns .			0
