when travellers set up camp next to their picturesque village , the people of @entity1 knew they were in for a long struggle			2
and so it proved – with taxpayers spending £ 200,000 on four years of legal battles and planning inquiries			1
finally however , the four @entity11 and @entity12 families – and their 60 caravans – have been given their marching orders			0
evicted : travellers have been ordered to leave this site in @entity1 , @entity17 despite trying to use human rights laws in order to stay opposition : the 78 @entity11 travellers had refused to budge despite facing three different courts , a planning inquiry , a council , and a battle by locals who accused the group of trashing their village yesterday residents of the @entity17 village , which has featured in @entity32 ’s @entity31 , were celebrating victory over their ‘ neighbours from hell ’			1
the saga began in november 2009 when a farmer sold the travellers a field on the outskirts of @entity1 , which is near @entity41			1
the group of around 30 adults and 40 children immediately began to lay down concrete and rig up lighting for their mobile homes			1
site : the travellers set up camp after sneaking in overnight in what neighbours described as a ' military - style operation ' after council offices had closed for the weekend angry villagers wrote to councillors , raising concerns about noise , road safety and a potential drop in house prices			1
there were also numerous complaints of poaching , trespassing , barking dogs and verbal abuse			0
officials at @entity68 won an injunction barring the illegal development , only for a county court judge to rule the camp should have a postcode to allow the travellers to claim benefits and summon the emergency services			1
@entity77 , parish councillor said the residents are ' relieved ' their ordeal is over neighbours : villagers in @entity1 had campaigned to have the traveller 's evicted after the group moved in in november 2009 anger : villagers wrote to councillors , raising concerns about noise , road safety and a potential drop in house prices after the travellers moved onto the site a series of legal hearings followed , including a planning inquiry , until , this week , the @entity97 ruled against the travellers			1
the council is now taking legal advice in the hope that it can now evict without further court challenges			2
yesterday parish councillor @entity77 said : ‘ we are all hugely relieved that this saga is finally coming to an end but it ’s such a pity so much time and a shocking amount of public money has been spent fighting this			1
‘ this case shows how much the legal system in this country needs to change			2
the travellers have been able to drag things out by constantly appealing and it is costing taxpayers enormous sums			2
’ branding them ‘ neighbours from hell ’ , she added : ‘ the amount of antisocial behaviour like fly tipping , theft and drunkenness has escalated hugely in the past four years since the travellers set up camp			1
‘ everyone is now hoping and praying that the eviction process can take place without any more trouble or legal hiccups			2
‘ this is a very small and close - knit community and i congratulate the villagers on the way that they have conducted themselves in the past four years			2
‘ they are all so pleased that they can start to turn their small community back into the place it was before			0
’ a spokesman for @entity144 said a report was being prepared for councillors but that ‘ we believe the travellers have now exhausted their last legal avenue ’			0
@entity149 , conservative mp for @entity68 , said : ‘ i know residents have been awaiting this decision by the @entity97 for some time so i ’m sure they are pleased things can now begin to move forward once again			1
’ last night one of the travellers insisted there was no question of them moving out			0
arguing there were no legal traveller camps in the area to move to , @entity156 said : ‘ we are not going anywhere , we have no place to go , we are homeless			0
find us a place , we have nowhere to go			0
they are treating us like animals			0
‘ they let people come in from @entity168 and yet they wo n’t find us a place			0
we ’ve no place to go			0
’ and in an apparent threat , she added : ‘ we are not moving – at the end of the day it will cost the council millions to move us			0
