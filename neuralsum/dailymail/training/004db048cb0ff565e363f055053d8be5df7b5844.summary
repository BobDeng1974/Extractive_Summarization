in an interview with @entity27 , she said @entity2 was an anti-feminist and ‘ psychological transvestite ’ , who did ‘ long - standing damage ’ to the country			1
it is not the first controversy the author has been caught up in			2
in 2013 , she said the @entity35 had gone from being a ‘ jointed doll on which certain rags are hung ’ to a woman whose ‘ only point and purpose ’ was to give birth			1

@entity0 described how she used her finger and thumb to form a gun when @entity2 wandered into view at noon on saturday , august 6 , 1983			2

i am gutted because @entity0 is one of my favourite authors			0

it is about a character whose demise is so recent			0
' later in the interview @entity75 reveals she did not considered herself to be either of the two characters featured in the short story and instead was ' standing by the window with the notebook '			1
miss @entity0 , a two - time @entity82 prizewinner , said the book had taken 30 years to write , but dismissed the idea she had been waiting for @entity2 ’s death to write it			2
‘ i am concerned with respect , i ’m not concerned with taste , ’ she said , adding : ‘ i would have happily concluded the story in her lifetime but could n't – it was my technical difficulty , not any delicacy			2
i believe in walking that line			0
you must n't be too timid to risk getting it wrong			0
’ the story has been hotly anticipated ever since news of its title was unveiled in january this year			2
