by @entity0 published : 22:44 est , 22 august 2012 updated : 10:45 est , 30 august 2012 a woman lost her $ 4.7million deposit because she refused to buy an $ 18.8million luxury @entity5 apartment when she found out it was ' unfinished and had no heat , hot water , air conditioning or gas			1
' @entity11 put down the cash on the suite in the @entity14 on the city 's @entity15 in january 2008 as the company was renovating the building			1
a judge ruled on monday that the conditions inside , while certainly not what ms @entity11 expected , did not prevent her from moving in on time , and thus did n't violate the property developer 's side of the agreement			1
lost : @entity11 , pictured with her ex-husband @entity26 , lost her deposit because the contract she signed protected the property developer ' only in @entity5 , ' @entity30 district judge @entity29 said , according to @entity31			2
the contract ms @entity11 signed promised a doorman , a concierge , elevator service , a package room , maintenance personnel , a fitness center , room service and dry cleaning			1
however , when she went to inspect her apartment april 15 , 2009 -- just days before she was set to close on the apartment -- she discovered it still was n't complete			0
ms @entity11 , the ex-wife of wealthy software tycoon @entity26 , brought along a home inspector , an architect and two attorneys to view the space			1
they found ' dangerously large gaps between the pavers on the terrace , ' unfinished floors and non-functioning heat , hot water , air conditioning , and cooking gas , according to court documents			0
judge @entity58 ruled that the contract protected the developer because it said the company was not liable for ' the interruption , discontinuance or quality of any such services ' in the apartment			0
furthermore , the judge disagreed with the claims of ms @entity11 's inspectors and said the developer reserved the right to repair ' minor defects ' after the closing			1
pulled out : the @entity14 , pictured here , is the luxury building where @entity11 put down a deposit for a condo but later backed out ' the absence of heat , hot water , and air conditioning on april 15 did not prevent @entity11 's occupancy of the suite because the relevant systems were completely and properly constructed , heat and air conditioning in fact were available , and gas service credibly could have been activated within @entity89 's next eight hour shift , ' the judge said in his order			2
furthermore , the contract stipulated that construction on the building would n't be finished for one year after the closing			0
despite the ruling against her , it all seemed to work out for ms @entity11 in the end			2
she currently owns an apartment at 15 @entity101 , one of the most enviable addresses in the city , the judge pointed out			0
@entity14 has had just two apartments sold in the last three years			0
thirty more are being operated as hotel suites .			0

@entity11 paid $ 4.7million in january 2008 to reserve a new apartment that was under construction
when she inspected it in april 2009 , she found **incomplete** flooring , dangerous gaps in pavers and other *deficiencies*
judge ruled that ms @entity11 was not entitled to get her money back because she could have moved into the apartment , even **incomplete**
