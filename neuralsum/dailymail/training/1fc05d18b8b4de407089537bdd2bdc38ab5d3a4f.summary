by @entity0 for @entity1 it is one of the oddest moons in the solar system			0
@entity6 , a small , icy moon of @entity8 , is covered in giant fault canyons 12 times as deep as the @entity11 , giving it a unique look leading to it being called a ' @entity14 '			1
now , researchers say they have finally discovered why it looks so unusual			0
a mosaic of high - resolution @entity20 images of @entity6 , the ' @entity14 ' of @entity8			1
one wide - angle and eight narrow - angle camera images of @entity6 were combined in this view to show off the bizarre deformed surface			1
at about 500 km in diameter , @entity6 is only one - seventh as large as @entity27 's moon			1
it sports one of the strangest and most varied landscapes among extraterrestrial bodies , including three large features known as ' coronae , ' which are unique among known objects in our solar system			0
they are lightly cratered collections of ridges and valleys , separated from the more heavily cratered ( and presumably older ) terrain by sharp boundaries like mismatched patches on a moth - eaten coat			0
@entity6 's giant fault canyons are as much as 12 times as deep as the @entity11			2
due to @entity6 's low gravity and large cliffs , a rock dropped off the edge of the highest cliff would take a full 10 minutes to reach the foot of the cliff			1
all of @entity8 ' larger moons , including @entity6 , are thought to consist mostly of roughly equal amounts of water ice and silicate rock			1
despite its relatively small size , @entity6 appears to have experienced an episode of intense resurfacing that resulted in the formation of at least three remarkable and unique surface features -- polygonal - shaped regions called coronae			1
these coronae are visible in @entity6 's southern hemisphere , and each one is at least 200 km across			2
@entity67 , the largest , has ridges and troughs with up to 2 km of relief			0
elsinore corona has an outer belt that is approx. 80 km wide , relatively smooth , and elevated above the surrounding terrain by approx. 100m			0
@entity76 corona has a trapezoidal shape with a large , bright chevron at its center			0
the giant fault canyons are as much as 12 times as deep as the @entity11			0
due to @entity6 's low gravity and large cliffs , a rock dropped off the edge of the highest cliff would take a full 10 minutes to reach the foot of the cliff			2
all of @entity8 ' larger moons , including @entity6 , are thought to consist mostly of roughly equal amounts of water ice and silicate rock			1
@entity20 image of @entity6 taken shortly before closest approach on 24 january 1986 at a range of 19,000 miles			0
@entity6 's giant fault canyons are as much as 12 times as deep as the @entity11			0
the northern hemisphere of @entity6 was never imaged by the @entity20 spacecraft , so it is unknown whether additional coronae exist			0
using numerical models , @entity101 and @entity102 from @entity103 proved that convection in @entity6 's ice mantle likely formed the coronae			2
' during convection , warm buoyant ice rose toward the surface , driving concentric surface extension beneath the locations of the coronae , causing the formation of extensional tectonic faults			2
' this style of resurfacing is similar to plate tectonics on @entity27 , in that convection is a primary driving force for surface deformation , ' they wrote			1
@entity101 and @entity122 write that the internal energy that powered convection probably came from tidal heating			0
tidal heating would have occurred when @entity6 was in an eccentric orbit -- moving closer to and further from @entity8			1
this caused the tidal forces from @entity8 to vary , periodically stretching and squeezing @entity6 and generating heat in its ice shell .			1

@entity6 is a small icy moon of @entity8
covered in large cracks up to 200km across
strange appearance has baffled *astronomers* for decades
researchers now say a warming ice surface caused the deformities
effect is similar to tectonic plate movement on @entity27
