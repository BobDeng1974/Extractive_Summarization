trusts have been telling consultants to switch to the cancer drug avastin rather than @entity12 , which is 15 times more expensive			1
both drugs treat wet age - related macular degeneration ( @entity15 ) , an eye disorder that can lead to blindness , but only @entity12 is licensed and approved for @entity19 use			1
its manufacturer @entity20 has mounted a legal challenge by seeking judicial review of the policy being pursued by a group of primary care trusts in the @entity27			1
it said widespread use of an unlicensed medicine undermined the system to protect patients			2
charities and the @entity33 of @entity34 were also concerned about possible health risks			2
now , the trusts have reversed their policy at a board meeting , claiming the price of @entity12 has been cut , making it a better deal			1
the reluctance of local eye specialists to use the cheaper alternative also meant the policy was not making planned savings			2
the list price for @entity12 is around £ 900 per injection while the estimated cost of a shot of @entity51 is £ 60			1
bosses at the @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 have not disclosed how much they had hoped to save			0
however , the trusts said switching drugs would have cut the £ 7.5million annual bill for treating wet @entity15			2
age - related macular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness among the elderly in the developed world			0
these pictures show how it affects the eye professor @entity68 , chairman of the @entity69 , said it continued to believe the policy was lawful , sensible and safe			0
but ‘ significant discounts ’ in the price of @entity12 are in the best interests of patients , he said			1
the professor added : ‘ the board also took into account the policy had not been taken up in any meaningful way by consultant ophthalmologists on the advice of their @entity33			0
‘ this has meant the potential benefits we envisaged , to patients and the @entity19 , of offering @entity51 as well as @entity12 , had not been realised			1
’ this decision could set a precedent for other @entity19 trusts planning to recommend @entity51 to cut costs , including @entity90 and @entity91			2
how age - related macular degeneration affects vision over time a @entity96 investigation last year found dozens of @entity97 in @entity98 have told consultants to switch to @entity51 , or leave the decision up to patients			1
although trial data suggests the two drugs are equally effective in treating @entity15 , @entity51 has not been licensed for this purpose and is being used ‘ off - label ’ which puts responsibility on the doctor to vouch for its safety			0
fears over side effects in the @entity111 led to the @entity112 stopping the use of @entity51 after reports of infections apparently caused by contaminated syringes			0
patients have lost their remaining sight and one man is suing for £ 2.6million in damages for loss of sight and brain damage as a result of an infection			0
some doctors attribute a high rate of infections from @entity51 to contamination by careless pharmacists splitting vials intended for cancer patients into small doses for eye treatment , but there is also concern the drug stays in the body far longer than @entity12			1
@entity137 , chief executive of the @entity138 , said @entity20 had taken ‘ the right course of action ’			0
he said ‘ we are pleased that @entity142 has decided to revoke its commissioning policy that had supported the use of a medicine which was unlicensed for the indication , in place of a licensed medicine which had already gained full regulatory approval			0
‘ it continues to be our view that off - label and unlicensed prescribing should be strictly limited to those circumstances where there is no licensed alternative and where the clinician , in discussion with the patient , decides that this is in their best interests			0
‘ loosening the regulations in this area would not only put a patient ’s safety at risk , it would also undermine the entire regulatory process which is in place to protect public health			0
