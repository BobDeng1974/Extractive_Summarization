by @entity0 published : 13:36 est , 3 october 2013 updated : 14:06 est , 3 october 2013 the widow of poisoned ex-kgb spy @entity2 has been refused legal funding to challenge the government 's decision not to hold a public inquiry into his death			1
three judges at @entity11 ’s @entity10 , @entity12 and mr @entity13 - refused to make a ' protected costs ' order			1
it means @entity2 - the only person eligible to challenge @entity18 's ruling - could be stripped her of all her assets if she lost the case			1
the judges said they would give their reasons tomorrow morning			0
denied : @entity2 , pictured at court today , could lose all her assets if she challenges the government poisoned : @entity2 was poisoned with radioactive polonium - 210 in tea in a @entity11 hotel @entity30 , appearing for the widow , blasted the setback in a case which he claims is of ' national and international interest '			2
today he explained his client wanted a public inquiry because she backed the coroner ’s view that an inquest would return an ' unjust and distorted ' verdict that was contrary to the evidence already heard			2
mr @entity41 told the judges : ' @entity43 is in possession of evidence which shows there is at least a prime facie case that his murder was ordered by officials of the @entity52 government			0
' the murder was ' an act of nuclear terrorism on the streets of @entity11 , ' he said			0
asking for legal costs to be covered , mr @entity41 explained the challenge - if unsuccessful - could lead to a £ 40,000 bill , which is almost ' everything she has in terms of assets she can access '			1
he added : ' mrs @entity2 regards her life as being on hold			0
it is very difficult for her to make decisions about the future until this process has come to a conclusion			0
' long battle : @entity71 has given countless interviews about what she calls a ' murder ordered by @entity75 ' since her husband ’s death she and their son @entity76 have battled to discover the truth about what led to his killing			2
mr @entity2 ’s family believe he was working for @entity84 at the time of his death and was killed on the orders of the @entity75			1
mr @entity2 , 43 , was poisoned with radioactive polonium - 210 while drinking tea with two @entity52 men , one a former @entity92 officer , at the @entity93 in @entity11 ’s @entity94 in 2006			0
coroner sir @entity95 asked for the public inquiry , saying that he could not hear evidence in public at a normal inquest linked to the alleged involvement of the @entity52 state in mr @entity2 ’s death			0
a further hearing will be held to decide whether or not mrs @entity2 can challenge @entity18 's ruling despite his request , the home secretary decided in may that the inquest should proceed , and the question whether to hold a public inquiry or other form of further investigation should be decided after a verdict was returned			1
mr @entity2 ’s widow @entity113 was left ' shocked and disappointed ' and launched proceedings to challenge the home secretary ’s decision			0
the question whether she should be given the go - ahead to challenge home secretary @entity18 ’s decision refusing an immediate inquiry is to be dealt with by judges at a further hearing .			1

judges at @entity11 's @entity10 refused to make ' protected costs ' order
@entity71 wants to challenge @entity18 's ruling against an inquiry
she believes he was working for @entity84 and killed on the orders of the @entity75
coroner claims a *review* would contradict evidence already heard
if unsuccessful she could be *landed* with £ 40,000 bill - all her assets ' worth
