by @entity0 published : 10:22 est , 7 november 2012 updated : 15:04 est , 7 november 2012 it has long been thought that warmer climes are good for our health			0
but a new study suggests that retiring abroad may not make as much difference as you thought			0
@entity9 researchers have found you 're more likely to die of a heart attack in winter regardless of the climate			1
retiring to a warm climate does not reduce your risk of a heart attack			1
new research has found you 're more likely to die of a heart attack in winter , regardless of the climate they looked at the death rates across warmer and cooler parts of @entity9 and found very little difference			1
the researchers , from the @entity24 in @entity25 , analysed four years of death certificate data from seven states with different climates : @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36			2
@entity32 , for example , is considered to have a warmer winter climate than somewhere chillier such as @entity36			2
for the years studied , in all areas , the total deaths as well as circulatory deaths ( i.e. heart and stroke - related deaths ) rose an average of 26 - 36 per cent during the winter compared to the summer			0
what surprised the researchers was that seasonal patterns of total and cardiac deaths were very similar in the seven different climate patterns			0
it was thought colder weather would increase the risk of a heart attack , but researchers found no evidence of this no matter where the figures were from , the pattern was the same : many more deaths in the winter than in the summer			1
‘ this was surprising because climate was thought to be the primary determinant of seasonal variation in death rates , ’ said @entity63 , lead author of the study			2
' we thought colder climates with a colder winter might have a higher increase [ in heart attacks ] in the wintertime or a prolonged increase in the wintertime , but that 's not what we found			0
' because low temperatures have often been linked with increased death rates , the researchers thought the winter peak would be more prominent in cold climates like @entity36 , added dr @entity63 , now a cardiology fellow at the @entity85			1
' but the death rates were similar			0
that means that temperature is a small factor - or not a factor at all			1
' the research was not designed to show why heart - related death rates rose across the board in the winter			1
but dr @entity63 suggested that people may ' acclimate to their local climate , ' making the change between summer and winter temperatures more important than how low the temperature dips in winter			0
flu season - which peaks in the winter - is another factor , he added			0
higher rates of respiratory infection have also been shown to raise the risk of death from a heart - related issue , which reinforces the importance of flu vaccines .			2

@entity9 researchers analysed heart attack death rates cross warmer and cooler parts of @entity9 and found very little difference between states
they did find a higher death rate in winter , regardless of the climate
' temperature is a small factor - or not a factor at all , ' say researchers
