by @entity0 published : 00:36 est , 4 november 2012 updated : 06:56 est , 4 november 2012 the incoming @entity2 c.e.o @entity1 will be grilled within days about his knowledge of the pedophilia scandal engulfing the @entity5 - the organisation which he was head of for eight years			1
an internal investigation run by the @entity5 is due to report by the end of the month on the decision by the @entity12 public broadcaster to pull a planned news report into the long serving television personality @entity15			1
since his death last year , @entity15 has been at the centre of countless allegations of sexual abuse towards young women and the internal review will seek to discover if mr. @entity1 knew of the allegations the current affairs program ' @entity24 ' was planning to make			1
drawn in : incoming @entity2 chief executive @entity1 ( left ) initially denied having any knowledge of a @entity5 programme 's investigation into alleged sexual abuse by television host @entity15 ( right ) it is not known whether mr. @entity1 will be interviewed by telephone or in person and it is understood that he will be offered legal representation during the course of his questioning			1
at the heart of the matter is what mr. @entity1 knew about the planned report and the incoming @entity2 chief has already amended his story after recalling a journalist mentioning the allegations against @entity15 at a party			2
@entity46 originally said that he was not aware of the sexual abuse allegations that were planned to be made			0
while the @entity5 has maintained it did not have the proof to run the allegations , the organisation will also be examined to see if the information they did have warranted being handed over to the police			0
this new development ramps up the pressure on mr. @entity1 with his future employees already questioning his suitability for the top job			0
last month @entity58 questioned the integrity and ability of the man who was director general when a report that would have exposed @entity15 as a predator who targeted young , vulnerable girls , was axed			2
writing in a blog post yesterday , the public editor , who works on behalf of readers and writes about the newspaper itself said : ' how likely is it that [ @entity1 ] knew nothing ? ' ' his integrity and decision - making are bound to affect the @entity2 and its journalism - profoundly			0
it 's worth considering now whether he is the right person for the job , given this turn of events			0
' paedophile : police have described the late @entity82 presenter @entity15 as one of @entity12 's worst sex offenders ' no knowledge ' : mr @entity1 said that , during his time as director - general of the @entity5 , he never heard any allegations or received any complaints about @entity90 ( pictured ) @entity15 who died in october 2011 is now acknowledged to have been one of the @entity93 's most prolific abusers with over 300 possible victims			1
mr @entity1 , who left the @entity5 after eight years last month , has said he would be happy to give evidence to @entity12 politicians investigating the scandal			1
he said he only learned about the planned documentary at a party last december when another journalist told him : ' you must be worried about the @entity24 investigation			0
' mr @entity1 said he did not ask for any more details , but made informal enquiries from @entity105 the next day and was told that the programme had been dropped for ' journalistic reasons '			1
he added that he did not ask what allegations against @entity15 were being investigated , and only found out about them almost a year later after he had stood down from the @entity5			2
after @entity15 died , @entity5 journalists for the @entity24 programme spent six weeks investigating allegations that the presenter abused pupils at a school in @entity117 , south - east @entity118			2
controversial : @entity58 ( far left ) was the first journalist at the @entity2 to question mr @entity1 's fitness to take the top job they spoke to at least four women who claimed they had been abused or knew about abuse at the school , but the programme never aired			1
more allegations came to light when a rival @entity12 broadcaster , @entity129 , aired a programme about @entity15 's behaviour			0
@entity12 police have received a flood of claims since the @entity129 documentary was shown , and more than 200 alleged victims have come forward			0
in a letter to the @entity139 mp @entity138 , mr @entity1 described the claims about @entity15 as ‘ exceptionally grave ’ but said that the director - general very rarely became involved in investigations before they were broadcast			1
he said : ' given the many hundreds of investigations the @entity5 does every year , the personal involvement of the @entity147 ( director - general ) in a given investigation would inevitably be unusual and noteworthy and could therefore have a distorting or chilling effect on the journalism involved			2
’ the @entity24 expose was also not in a list of ' potentially sensitive programmes ' drawn up as part of @entity5 ’s editorial policy as far as he could recall , he said			0
mr @entity1 added that , during his time as director - general of the @entity5 , he never heard any allegations or received any complaints about @entity15 , adding : ‘ his name scarcely came up at all			1
’ he said he finally heard about the claims when the @entity129 programme was publicised last month , after he had left the @entity5			0
. this was despite reports about the @entity5 's decision to drop the @entity24 investigation having previously appeared in five newspapers , including the @entity170 .			0

mr @entity1 stepped down as head of the @entity5 in *september*
he denies knowing details of canned investigation into @entity5 television personality @entity15
will be allowed legal representation when he is questioned some time over the coming week
