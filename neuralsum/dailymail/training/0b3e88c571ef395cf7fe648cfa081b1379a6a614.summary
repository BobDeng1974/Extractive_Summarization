' she was living at the orphanage and teaching at the primary school			1
she taught dance but she obviously helped out with the cooking and so on			1

' i think she went to hospital on tuesday and died on wednesday morning at around 6 a.m. - but it 's all very unclear at the moment			1

there are effective drugs but there are resistant parasites			0

' malaria is a serious tropical disease spread by mosquitoes and if it 's not diagnosed and treated promptly , it can be fatal			2
it only takes a single mosquito bite for someone to become infected			0
symptoms include a fever , sweats and chills , headaches , vomiting , muscle pains and diarrhoea			0
these usually appear between seven and 18 days after a person becomes infected , though the disease can lay dormant for up to a year in some cases before symptoms begin to show , according to the @entity191			0
malaria is found in more than 100 , mainly tropical , countries			0
the most common regions for malaria include large areas of @entity108 and @entity196 ; @entity197 and @entity198 ; @entity199 and the @entity200 ; parts of the @entity202 and some @entity204 islands			0
the latest @entity206 statistics show there were 207 million cases of malaria worldwide and 627,000 deaths in 2012			0
that year , some 1,400 @entity3 returned to the @entity3 having contracted malaria and two of them died			1
there is currently no vaccine available that offers protection against malaria , so it is very important travelers take antimalarial medication to reduce the chances of becoming infected			0
however , antimalarials only reduce the risk of infection by about 90 per cent			0
as such , taking steps to avoid bites is also vital .			2
