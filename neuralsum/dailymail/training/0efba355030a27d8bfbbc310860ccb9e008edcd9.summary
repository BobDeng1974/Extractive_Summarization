by @entity0 for @entity1 celebrity tv chef @entity2 has blasted the health secretary over pitiful meals being served in @entity6 hospitals as he backed @entity1 's campaign to improve food given to patients			1
mr @entity2 , a hospital food standards campaigner , took to @entity11 to speak out against @entity12 after it emerged that the @entity14 said it would not consider introducing legislation to legally enforce food standards in @entity6 hospitals			1
posting a link to @entity1 readers ' photographs of hospital food , he wrote : ' eat like this for a week and tell me there is nothing wrong like you did before @ @entity26			1
pictured is a plate of potatoes with a slice of ham and fruit at @entity39 @entity29 ( left ) with tv chef @entity2 ( right ) , who has backed @entity1 's campaign for better hospital food , said the only way standards will improve is to enforce them by law ' you should be ashamed			1
' he went on : ' the majority of hospitals ruin it for the few that are doing well			2
' that hurts the team in them # @entity56			0
' i 've tried five years to speak to someone in government and the response is they 're ' too busy ' @entity57 ' his comments come as a former member of a government panel investigating hospital food said the only way to improve patient meals throughout the @entity6 is to enforce new standards by law			1
@entity29 resigned from the @entity71 after being told the @entity14 would not consider putting forward legislation regardless of the outcomes of a report into the standard of hospital food			1
on the eve the report 's publication , the campaigner has slammed the ‘ infuriating ’ system which has placed the standards of prison meals under closer scrutiny			1
celebrity tv chef and hospital food standards campaigner @entity2 tweeted a link to @entity1 readers ' photographs of hospital food and mentioned health secretary @entity12 in his post ‘ restaurants are held to a legal standard and are shut down if they do n’t comply – and these are places where people are choosing to eat , ' said mr @entity29 of the @entity93			1
‘ by not creating legislation specifically for this , the government has set about finding a solution which appears to be what we want but in practice , it is n't			1
’ meanwhile , more @entity1 readers shared photographs of substandard meals at facilities across @entity105			1
in 2012 , mr @entity29 supported a bill proposed by @entity107 in the houses of @entity109 to legally bind hospitals to meet food standards			1
after it was rejected , the @entity14 created the panel to investigate the situation across @entity6 hospitals			1
it was to report its findings to dr @entity116 , the parliamentary under secretary of state at the @entity14 , for his consideration			1
its findings and recommendations will be published tomorrow			1
however upon the panel ’s construction , dr @entity116 told its members no matter the outcome of their research , the department would not consider putting forward any legislation to enforce standards			1
‘ what i wanted and what i hoped to be the case was that we would be allowed to consider a number of things including having new legislation put through parliament , ' added mr @entity29			1
the campaigner , pictured with prince @entity140 , resigned from his position on a government panel investigating food standards as he felt his ' hands were tied ' critics have slammed hospitals ' failure to improve food standards despite other @entity6 initiatives in the past			1
this plate of mashed potato and quiche at @entity39 was among readers ' photos a patient at @entity156 was served this mushroom stroganoff in november			1
a hospital spokesman said while a range of options was offered to patients , it constantly strives to ' improve and invest in nutrition ' lunch at the @entity165 in @entity166 was a sandwich with side salad - a tiny piece of lettuce , tomato and one slice of cucumber ' at the first meeting @entity116 gave a spiel and i said : “ it seems to me you 're not allowing us to advocate new legislation if we want it			1
” ‘ he said that was one thing they would not consider			0
' i thought at that point that our hands were tied			0
’ instead , the @entity14 will introduce new rules in existing @entity6 contracts to map out acceptable standards			1
a breach of the new rules will be considered a breach of contract and therefore considered legally binding , say officials			2
but with the same @entity6 - governed bodies charged with monitoring and reporting failure to adhere to the rules the situation may never improve , says mr @entity29			1
‘ all of these commissions are self - reported and we have decades of evidence to suggest that that does n’t work			0
‘ what we need is a similar system to the school meals standards law which is monitored by an independent body			1
‘ but what they ’ve proposed is tinkering with commission contracts and hoping for the best			2
‘ we ’ve been doing that for years and it has n’t approved at all			0
there have been hundreds of initiatives that have n’t worked			0
‘ there is zero connection with patients as well			2
‘ the government is aware that there is public outcry about hospital food and there ’s also public outcry that there 's nothing being done			2
‘ these recommendations have been drawn up by members of the panel in a dark room			0
i was worried about that from the outset , they ’ll not be seen by patients			2
mashed potato and meatballs at @entity233 in @entity234 was served with a side of fruit in a cup a plain jacket potato with jelly , an apple and a pot of cheese was served at @entity243			2
the hospital apologised for the patient 's dissatisfaction and said it was ' always looking for ways to improve ' ‘ there ’s no public consultation			0
it would be an issue of public ownership putting standards into law			2
‘ let ’s put it in the hands of elected members of parliament , not officials			0
‘ what they ’ve done is go through a lengthy bureaucratic process of not achieving the goal			0
’ mr @entity29 added he was concerned over those appointed to the panel , with many members involved in supplying food to hospitals			1
‘ these guys are suppliers and the public sector is the consumer			0
in any negotiation , when does the supplier tell the customer what to do ? ’ @entity278 of @entity279 , whose chairman is at the head of the panel , confirmed they were told the report would not result in legislation from the outset			2
‘ that was the decision we were working to throughout , that there would be an opportunity to deal with it in a different way than having to go through the process of putting a bill through parliament			0
‘ we really hope people will move forward and take it ( the report ) seriously but a range of checks and balances are being made			2
’ asked when @entity6 staff will be made aware of any changes , a @entity14 spokesman said the new contracts will not be completed and distributed until april next year			1
a @entity14 spokesman said : ' legislation is a red herring – there are other ways that we can introduce mandatory food standards that will be quicker for the @entity6 to act on and more flexible for the future			1
' we are determined to see better hospital food across the country and we ’ll say more about our plans for this tomorrow			2
' @entity116 has not responded to @entity1 ’s requests for comment			2
as pressure on the government to improve hospital meals grows , a cardiac patient has revealed being fed salty food in hospital , to the concern of a dietitian			1
@entity323 was admitted to @entity324 in december with atrial fibrillation after collapsing			0
the 29 - year - old learned he had a systemic right heart failure which had previously gone undiagnosed			0
the 29 - year - old was given this plate of fish and chips with peas which was heavily seasoned with salt but throughout his care he was fed meals heavy in salt and sodium – a ‘ concerning ’ decision says @entity339 of the @entity340			0
‘ if that ’s what he was given without a choice then i would be concerned			0
‘ i would n't want highly salted ( foods for a patient of this condition			0
) he needs a low salt diet , if it 's atrial fibrillation causing right heart failure			0
‘ baked beans are high in salt , the portions can be small so it would n't be a major issue , but if he had right heart failure we should be reducing his salt intake			0
‘ cheese is high in salt as well			0
it may be he was suffering from a lack of available choice but that is n’t acceptable			0
‘ the white bread sandwich is not something i would want a patient of that condition to eat ’			0
mr @entity323 was admitted to hospital after collapsing suddenly in december			0
the father - of - one learned he had been suffering a systemic right heart failure since childhood , though he had never known			0
throughout his time at the hospital mr @entity323 said meals were consistently inadequate and that he eventually relied on his family to bring him food			1
‘ my family had to bring food in as by the pictures , the food was horrendous			0
baked beans are also high in salt			0
mr @entity323 said he resorted to having his family bring him in meals due to lack of choice cheese and white bread is not recommended for someone with mr @entity323 's condition according to a dietitian , but was served at the hospital cheese - topped pasta was another one of the meals he was given despite suffering a condition which requires a low salt intake ‘ i did n't argue as the woman serving spoke little @entity397 and the only time i said anything she shrugged it off			1
’ among the food he was given was a sponge raspberry pudding , baked potato , and a cheese sandwich made on white bread			0
a portion of fish and chips , covered in salt , and a bowl of tomato and cheese pasta with ‘ uncooked ’ meatballs were also served			0
mr @entity323 said he would been more forthright to complain about the quality of his meals if there were stronger regulations in place			2
‘ if there were food standards in place i definitely would have said something , if you were served that in a restaurant , let alone a greasy spoon , you would say something or even refuse to pay , even my school dinners were better quality			1
‘ as it stands the servers rush in and out again , most of the time not even mentioning that the plate is as full as when they left it , i think even the people serving the food are aware of the quality			0
’ @entity324 has not responded to @entity1 's request for comment			2
