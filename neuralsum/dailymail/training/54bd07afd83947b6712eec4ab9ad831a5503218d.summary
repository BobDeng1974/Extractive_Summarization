i 'm not getting involved in discussing that with you			2
' in an attempt to rescue the interview , which was printed in the @entity45 , mr @entity7 said : ' that 's fair enough but the point i 'm trying to get across is do you think it 's difficult , because you speak your mind and that 's the most impressive thing			1
' interrupting the reporter , sir @entity0 said : ' it 's not bullying if you speak you 're mind is it			1
' mr @entity7 then attempted to laugh it off , saying : ' well not necessarily but some people may interpret it that way			0

i do n't flower my words and if i think someone is useless i 'll tell them but if i think someone has done a good job i 'll also tell them			0

' the interview took place ahead of a new series of @entity11 , which is celebrating its 10th anniversary lord @entity0 replied : ' that 's not bullying , that 's just cutting through the nonsense as you put it			1

good on @entity7 for turning what could have been a fluffy piece into something entertaining			0
