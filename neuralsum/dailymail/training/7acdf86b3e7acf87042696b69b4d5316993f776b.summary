this week the pop diva presented us with a cropped , curved fringe she has a flawless face , curvaceous figure and high - fashion style — not to mention millions of fans — so it ’s little wonder that when pop star @entity10 debuts a new look , it sparks a wave of imitations			1
yet the 33 - year - old this week presented us with a hairstyle only the bold will seek to emulate : a cropped , curved fringe spookily reminiscent of @entity18			1
even her most ardent admirers were horrified			2
what had possessed @entity10 to hack her tumbling caramel waves so severely ? well , it seems that she may not have been brave , or silly , enough to go for the chop after all			1
the offending fringe ’s only saving grace seems to be that hairdressers believe it is in fact a ‘ winge ’ — or a fringe wig			1
‘ i have no doubt that , in @entity10 ’s case , the fringe is a wig			1
a badly positioned , untidy , fringe wig , ’ says celebrity stylist @entity30			2
‘ @entity36 are really popular on the catwalks , with some designers sending armies of models down the runway with identical ones clipped in , but @entity10 ’s is all wrong			1
' had it been straight , sleek and perfectly groomed , it could have been a bold and fashionable statement			0
instead , the look is a dry , bristly broom — more @entity47 than fashion show			0
’ fringe wigs are roughly 6in long sections of hair with clips attached to them , which can be used to attach the hairpiece to the crown , and are styled to look like natural hair			1
while they may sound — and often look — utterly bizarre , they have been growing in popularity in @entity59 over the past six years , since hairdressing chain @entity60 launched them in salons and online			0
they are now available for as little as £ 20 from @entity66 stores such as @entity67 , and come in a range of shades to match different hair colours			2
while the cheaper ones will be made of nylon , and may have an unnatural sheen and texture , for £ 50 to £ 70 it is possible to buy one made of human hair			2
@entity10 is n’t the only celebrity to road - test a fringe while running shy of taking the chop			1
actresses @entity81 and @entity83 are both said to have sported clip - in fringes on the red carpet , while reality tv star @entity87 has gushed about her love of fake fringes			1
actresses @entity81 ( left ) and @entity83 ( right ) are also said to have worn winges on the red carpet for someone with my chequered history with fringes — i ’m still reeling from the hideous pageboy cut my mother inflicted on me when i was six — the prospect of trying a new clip - on look without committing to a radical re-style is far more appealing			1
and if it does n’t work — mentioning no names , @entity10 — you can just take it out			1
quick ! pop diva winge how we did it : we used £ 30 clip - in winges from @entity111 ’s online boutique @entity112 to give me five very different fringes			1
with this one , the stylist clipped it in place , an inch in front of my crown , and chopped steadily			0
she created an undercut in the fringe , where the top layer is longer than the layers underneath , giving it the appearance of a ledge standing proud of the forehead			2
@entity129 's verdict : the winge of the moment is not for me — not now , not ever ! i looked in the mirror and was reminded of the time my four - year - old daughter cut her own hair with a pair of nail scissors			1
if this is high fashion , why do i look so frumpy ? if i had a stylist , i ’d sack her immediately			0
@entity143 : ‘ it looked like my four year old had been at it with nail scissors ’ says @entity129 of the @entity139 ( left ) , while the eyebrow grazing winge ( right ) left her flustered after half an hour @entity146 how we did it : this hardly needed any styling			2
the hairdresser simply clipped in the winge and gently cut upwards into it , creating a shattered edge — i could easily do this one at home			0
@entity129 's verdict : i quite liked peering out from under my fringe in a sultry fashion — and it certainly hides the wrinkles on my forehead			1
but after half an hour i was getting flustered and desperately wanted to scrape my hair away from my face			2
@entity164 how we did it : my ingenious hairdresser grabbed an old roller , cut it length - ways and re-rolled it , into a tighter cyclinder			2
she then clipped in the winge , and pinned it around the roller to create a short , tight roll across the top of my forehead			0
@entity129 's verdict : i was n’t expecting to love this cartoonish , bubble fringe			1
and , lo and behold			0
it felt totally ridiculous and rather precarious , as the synthetic winge tried to unfurl itself			0
unflattering and frankly silly , there ’s no way i ’d try this one again			0
@entity129 was expecting to love the victory roll winge ( left ) but was left feeling silly			0
the side sweep winge on the other hand @entity187 how we did it : the hairdresser took a winge and clipped it in on at a slight angle , along the line of my parting			0
in order to conceal the join , she resorted to craftily pinning pieces of my own hair over the top			2
@entity129 's verdict : when you live behind a curtain of thick hair , as i do , this kind of half fringe is good for softening your look			1
i do n’t think i could style it @entity209 how we did it : the stylist gave my own hair a centre - parting , and clipped the winge high , close to my crown			1
then she set about cutting it bluntly and drastically , so it sat half an inch or so above my eyebrows			0
@entity129 's verdict : i ’ve always secretly admired the iconic style of @entity222 in @entity223 , and wondered whether i could pull of that very blunt fringe			1
it looks awful , highlighting my strong jaw			0
i ’d have to wear huge amounts of make - up to look remotely glamorous			2
@entity129 thought the long blunt winge ( left ) highlighted her strong jaw and that she would have to wear huge amounts of make - up to look glamorous			1
she is pictured with the clip - in fringe , right fancy a boiled egg ? bored of your daily lunchtime sandwich ? how about a fresh boiled egg with a perfectly soft yolk , brewed in the office kettle ? place your egg in the kettle and cover it with an inch of water			1
the important thing is to keep the egg away from the heating element so you will need to tilt the kettle at an angle — try putting a pad of post-it notes beneath one side of it			0
this will keep the egg clear of the metal element			0
when it turns itself off , start a timer ( on your mobile phone if you do n’t have an egg timer to hand ) and leave your egg in the kettle for 12 minutes			0
then drain the water away very carefully and take your egg out			0
let it cool for a minute or two and it ’s ready to eat			0
do be careful as you ’re doing it not to scald yourself			0
and do n’t be surprised if your colleagues object to their cups of tea taking on a slightly sulphurous taste .			0
