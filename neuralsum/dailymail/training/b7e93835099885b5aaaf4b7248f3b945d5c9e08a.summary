we are seeing the evolution of @entity2 in this @entity3			1
the new version is not as dynamic , but is equally devastating			2
he has become more of an old - fashioned playmaker , with everything coming through him			0
he ’s on the prowl , smelling danger , waiting for the opportunity to pounce and to come alive at the point of maximum impact , but conserving his energy until such an opening presents itself			0
he does n’t seem to be running as much , he is waiting for the ball			0
his running stats were the lowest on the pitch against @entity18 , which is evidence of the change in his game - but he caused maximum trouble and won the match for @entity25			1
my first thought in the opening games was ‘ he ’s quiet ’ , but the more i study his performances , the more i believe he ’s in control and waiting for that moment to arrive when he can make a difference			2
we have seen him make an impact , with the last - minute winner against @entity57 , the brilliant run that created the goal against @entity18 - he has still won the man of the match four times in four games and nobody has ever done that before in a @entity3			1
leader : his team - mates have repeatedly looked to their captain for inspiration at this @entity3 withdrawn : @entity2 was subbed off against @entity69 to preserve him for the knockout rounds with four goals in those four games , he ’s carried @entity25 to this stage			1
but we have n’t seen a 90 - minute performance like we used to see for @entity41 when @entity75 was manager and @entity2 was forever on the ball			1
people may say he is too young to have to change his game			0
he is only 26 , after all , but playing at the top with that pressure and intensity takes its toll and in terms of games played he ’s probably closer to 30			2
so we may never see the old @entity2 again , but we should champion him for changing			1
@entity85 : @entity86 led @entity25 to @entity3 glory in @entity88 in 1986 he is the most important player in his team and , while he has been in the shadow of @entity86 , who won the @entity3 single - handedly in 1986 , @entity2 can go some way to emulating him if he can take this team to victory in the land of their fierce @entity97 rivals			1
his @entity100 attacking colleagues have been , in the main , disappointing			0
@entity104 is n’t fully fit , @entity103 has struggled , @entity102 has shown flashes and , apart from the @entity2 - inspired winner against @entity18 , @entity37 has failed to show			2
so @entity2 has a heavy weight to carry			2
fully focused : @entity2 works with a ball in training on friday ahead of @entity25 's clash with @entity111 smiling assassin : @entity2 trains with his @entity25 team - mates in @entity114 on friday @entity115 of @entity116 and @entity25 said after the game against @entity18 that everyone wants to pass to @entity2 and then watch him work his magic , as if his own team - mates are in awe of him			1
so the change in his play is not weakening his standing , nor his output			0
remember his performance against @entity116 in the @entity127 , where he was magnificent while barely breaking out of a jog ? we are seeing that repeated here			0
his battle with @entity116 ’s captain @entity132 that night made for excellent viewing in the @entity134 and i hope we see the same today when they face @entity111 in the quarter - final			0
marked man : @entity2 has managed to shine despite his team - mates failing to perform at their best glory : the @entity100 star celebrates scoring his team 's first goal against @entity69 with a thumping effort technique : @entity2 strokes home the winner in @entity25 's first group match versus @entity57 better than ' @entity148 ' ? if @entity2 wins the @entity3 with @entity25 he could surpass the legend of @entity86 @entity2 will have to come out on top if @entity25 are to progress			1
for many , this is the tournament that will define him			0
he has been brilliant so far , but there will be better opponents from now on			0
how will the new model @entity2 fare ? if he delivers , we will be asking : ‘ where does he stand alongside @entity160 and @entity86 ? ’			1

the attacker has scored four goals in four games so far and has been named man of the match in each of @entity25 's matches
the shadow of @entity86 hangs over @entity2 after he led @entity25 to @entity3 victory in 1986
but if this new , *remodelled* @entity2 repeats @entity86 's fete in @entity173 , he will be right on par with his mentor
