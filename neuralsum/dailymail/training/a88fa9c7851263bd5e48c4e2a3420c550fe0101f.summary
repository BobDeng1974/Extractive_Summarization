@entity1 's answer to a ' space taxi ' is now poised and ready to launch on a february 11 test flight			1
dubbed the @entity4 , for @entity4 , the craft will provide @entity1 with its own shuttle - like , reusable space vehicle			1
this mission will provide vital flight data that could help @entity1 develop technology for a sample return mission to @entity12 , or to return astronauts from the space station			1
pictured is the @entity4 ( @entity4 ) flight model during the last preparations at @entity21 in @entity22 on february 11 , the @entity24 rocket will be launching the unmanned space plane from @entity26 , @entity27 , to undertake a 100 - minute test flight			1
the initial launch had been scheduled for november 18 , but @entity30 in october announced a postponement ' to carry out additional flight trajectory analyses '			0
studded with 300 sensors , the prototype @entity4 will collect data on the craft 's handling and thermodynamics			1
' launch preparations have resumed , ' said @entity40 , @entity42 's @entity4 launch campaign manager			2
' batteries that were removed from @entity4 are being taken from cold storage , charged and reinstalled			0
no additional tests are needed – @entity4 is ready to fly			0

pictured on the right is an artist 's impression of the spacecraft ' batteries that were removed from @entity4 are being taken from cold storage , charged and reinstalled			2
no additional tests are needed – @entity4 is ready to fly			0
' weighing around two tonnes and the size of a car , @entity4 is a snug fit inside @entity24 's protective fairing			0
the two - piece shell will open to release the space plane at an altitude of 200 miles ( 320 km )			0
@entity4 will coast to up to 260 miles ( 420 km ) and then begin its re-entry phase , recording a vast amount of data from a large number of conventional and advanced sensors			2
the entry speed of 4.6 miles per second ( 7.5 km / s ) at an altitude of 75 miles ( 120 km ) will create the same conditions as those for a vehicle returning from low orbit			0
this mission will provide vital flight data that could help @entity1 develop technology for a sample return mission to @entity12 , or to return astronauts from the space station			1
pictured is the @entity4 installed on its payload adapter developed over five years at a cost of 150 million euros ( $ 225 million ) , the @entity4 is the testbed for a reusable vehicle that may one day be able to land on a conventional runway on @entity96 after a mission to space weighing two tonnes and the size of a car , @entity4 is a snug fit inside @entity24 's protective fairing ( pictured )			1
the mission will last 100 minutes @entity4 will be launched into a suborbital path by a @entity24 rocket launched from spaceport in @entity27 in february 11			1
@entity4 will separate from @entity24 at an altitude of 200 miles ( 340 km ) @entity4 will be launched into a suborbital path by a @entity24 rocket launched from @entity1 ’s @entity109 in @entity27 in february 11			1

the entry speed of 4.6 miles per second ( 7.5 km / s ) at an altitude of 75 miles ( 120 km ) will create the same conditions as those for a vehicle returning from low orbit			0
@entity4 will glide through the atmosphere at hypersonic speeds to test new re-entry technologies before parachutes deploy to slow the descent for a splashdown in the @entity129			2
@entity4 will glide through the atmosphere at hypersonic speeds to test new @entity1 re-entry technologies before parachutes deploy to slow the descent for a safe splashdown in the @entity129			1
the @entity136 recovery vessel is now stationed in @entity137 in @entity138			0
over the last month , the crew have been testing the equipment for hoisting @entity4 out of the water			0
developed over five years at a cost of 150 million euros ( $ 225 million ) , the @entity4 is the testbed for a reusable vehicle that may one day be able to land on a conventional runway on @entity96 after a mission to space			1
this could be useful for bringing astronauts back from the @entity150 ( @entity150 )			0
the only craft currently able to ferry astronauts to the @entity150 and back is @entity154 's @entity153			0
@entity4 program manager , @entity155 , said there are a number of follow - on applications for re-entry technologies , including @entity12 sample - return missions this could be useful for bringing astronauts back from the @entity150 ( @entity150 )			1
last month saw two major setbacks for the space industry			0
on october 28 , an @entity166 rocket exploded shortly after launch on what was to be a supply mission to the @entity150 this was followed three days later by the crash of @entity174 tourist space plane @entity172 on a test flight , killing one of two pilots			2
studded with an array of 300 sensors ( locations pictured ) the prototype @entity4 will collect data on the craft 's handling and thermodynamics the two - piece shell of @entity24 will open to release the space plane at an altitude of 200 miles ( 320 km )			1
pictured is an artist 's impression of various stage of the test flight @entity4 will glide through the atmosphere before parachutes slow the final descent			2
pictured is a prototype being recovered in @entity199			0

@entity4 will provide @entity1 with a shuttle - like spacecraft that could take off from a conventional runway
on february 11 , the craft will undergo a 100 - minute flight to test critical *systems* using 300 sensors
the mission could also help @entity1 develop technology to return astronauts from the space station
