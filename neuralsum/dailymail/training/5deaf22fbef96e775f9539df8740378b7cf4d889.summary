@entity0 , a former @entity1 mp , condemned the ‘ back - stabbing ’ of @entity3 by former supporters @entity3 has been the victim of ‘ vomit - inducing ’ attacks from people who once backed the invasion of @entity8 , a @entity1 peer has claimed			1
the former prime minister has been roundly criticised for his call for new military intervention to counter the rise of militant extremists in @entity14			1
but @entity0 , a former mp , condemned the ‘ back - stabbing ’ of mr @entity3 and insisted that the threat of weapons of mass destruction in @entity8 ( @entity17 ) was not the sole reason for backing the 2003 invasion			1
two weeks ago mr @entity3 , who led @entity20 into the conflict alongside @entity23 president @entity22 , denied the appalling bloodshed was connected to the 2003 invasion			2
‘ we have to liberate ourselves from the notion that ' we ' have caused this , ’ the former prime minister wrote in an extraordinary essay			2
’ he went on to call for decisive military response ' including military strikes against extremists in @entity8 and @entity33 '			0
the remarks sparked a furious backlash from across the political spectrum , including from senior labour and @entity39 figures who supported the war in 2003			0
@entity0 used a @entity43 debate on the situation in @entity8 to condemn mr @entity3 ’s critics			0
he told peers : ‘ i supported the first intervention in the early 1990s and in 1997 to 2001 repeatedly called for and openly supported military intervention			2
‘ i was not alone and i find it what i can only describe as vomit - inducing to hear the back - stabbing of @entity3 from many who openly supported intervention and are now in denial			1
‘ the idea that most of us supported intervention on the single justification of @entity17 is nonsense			0
our concerns went far wider			0
’ the 70 - year - old was a @entity1 mp for @entity62 from 1979 - 2001 , and served on @entity64 ’s frontbench in the 1980s and 1990s			1
former prime minister @entity3 has been heavily criticised for his call for new military intervention to tackle the threat posed by @entity69 jihadists who have seized control of large areas of the @entity8 speaking in last night ’s debate , he said that in the run - up to the @entity8 invasion the main concerns on both sides of the @entity75 had been the need to protect the @entity79 , stop environmental destruction and population displacement in the south , and curtail the aspirations of @entity84 to invade neighbouring states			1
he added : ‘ in my view one of the most important reasons , rarely talked about , was the need to remove @entity84 's threat to the international oil economy			0
‘ that threat was a cause of volatility in international oil markets with the potential to destabilise economies and impact on the employment policies in the oil - dependent economies in the @entity102 - something we should still have in mind			0
‘ these are the real reasons for intervention , not @entity17 and my only criticism of @entity3 is that concerns over justification in international law drove us down the wmd route			0
’ his defence of mr @entity3 comes after two weeks of heavy criticism for his call for @entity20 to join new military strikes to counter the threat posed by @entity69 jihadists who have seized control of large areas of the @entity8 , plunging the country into its bloodiest crisis since the withdrawal of @entity23 troops in 2011			1
lord @entity124 , who served as deputy prime minister at the time of the war , accused mr @entity3 of trying to take the @entity102 ' back to the crusades '			1
@entity129 , the foreign secretary at the time of the invasion , said it was ' impossible ' to argue that the war ordered by mr @entity3 ' played no part at all in today 's events '			0
fighters of the @entity137 - inspired @entity14 ( @entity14 ) parade in a commandeered @entity8 security forces vehicle down a main road at the northern city of @entity142 , @entity8 former deputy pm lord @entity124 accused mr @entity3 of wanting to take the @entity102 ' back to the crusades ' but @entity145 insisted the @entity8 war had been a ‘ mistake honestly made ’ @entity148 , who voted in favour of the 2003 war , claimed mr @entity3 ‘ surely needs professional psychiatric help ’ for refusing the accept that the conflict was a ‘ tragic mistake ’			1
former foreign minister @entity154 urged mr @entity3 to ' stay quiet ' because his presence in the debate was driving people to oppose what might be the necessary response			2
; @entity160 , who quit mr @entity3 's cabinet in the aftermath of the 2003 invasion , said he had been ' absolutely , consistently wrong , wrong , wrong ' on the issue , and opposed more strikes			0
however lord @entity166 leapt to mr @entity3 ’s defence , insisting the @entity8 war was a ‘ mistake honestly made ’			2
the former labour cabinet minister insisted mr @entity3 had not ‘ gone a bit nuts ’ for calling for new military action and did not take the ‘ country to war on a lie ’ .			1
