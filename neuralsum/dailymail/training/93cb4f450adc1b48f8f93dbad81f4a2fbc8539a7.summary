by @entity1 - squire for the @entity2 with his smiling mother and aunt , this is little @entity7 in one of the first portraits of his extraordinary family			1
but the happy picture belies the emotional roller - coaster the two sisters have endured to bring him into the world			0
for not only is @entity17 his aunt , she is also his surrogate mother – stepping in to carry the baby after her sister learnt treatment for cervical cancer would leave her infertile			1
thanks to the remarkable selflessness of miss @entity38 , though , she is now the delighted mother of @entity7			2
he was born three months ago weighing 6lb 4oz after a four - hour labour			0
for the first fortnight after @entity7 ’s birth , miss @entity38 , 33 , went to live with her sister and husband @entity46 , 51 , to help the baby settle in			1
yesterday miss @entity38 , a trainee cardiac physiologist , said : ‘ although @entity7 is biologically mine , from the moment he was conceived to the magical time i held him for the first time , i only ever thought of him as @entity25 ’s baby			1
‘ so it was never hard to let him go to her			0
i just felt relieved when he was born that he was healthy and delighted to see him bring @entity25 and @entity46 so much joy			1
’ mrs @entity25 said : ‘ words can not express how much i can ever thank @entity17 for what she ’s done			1
@entity46 and i are simply overjoyed to be parents again and @entity33 already dotes on her little brother			2
’ the sisters , from @entity63 , south - east @entity64 , are the eldest of four and have always been close			0
selfless : @entity17 stepped in when @entity25 ( right with husband @entity46 and daughter @entity33 ) was left infertile the labour : @entity17 pictured in hospital on the day			1
she found out she was pregnant on @entity25 's birthday there are two types of surrogacy			1
one is ‘ straight ’ ( or traditional ) , where a surrogate uses her own eggs and is artificially inseminated with the father ’s sperm			0
however , the majority of cases in the @entity79 are host ( or gestational ) surrogacy , where @entity83 is carried out with the eggs and sperm of the intended parents			0
the embryo is then implanted into the surrogate mother			0
under @entity92 law , the legal mother of the child is the surrogate			0
the intended mother is not recognised as a parent , even if she is the child ’s biological mother			0
after six weeks the ‘ parents ’ can apply for a @entity97 that will give them full parental rights over the child			0
but their bond grew stronger when mrs @entity25 was diagnosed with cancer in december 2012 after a routine smear test			1
she said : ‘ knowing i urgently needed radiotherapy and chemotherapy was devastating			0
but @entity46 and i had hoped to have a sibling for @entity33			2
' so it was a double blow when doctors broke the news that saving my life would destroy my eggs and leave my uterus too scarred to carry a baby			0
’ when she told her family the heartbreaking news , her sister , who has no children of her own , instantly volunteered to carry a baby for her			2
they bought an artificial insemination kit and after two months of trying using publican mr @entity7 ’s sperm , miss @entity38 became pregnant			2
she said : ‘ it was @entity25 ’s birthday and telling her i was pregnant was the most wonderful gift to give her			1
’ miss @entity38 , who gave birth in a birthing pool , said : ‘ @entity25 cut the cord and it felt completely natural for her to take him in her arms for a cuddle			2
' i ’ll never forget seeing her kiss him for the first time and seeing then how much a new baby meant to her			0
’ she added : ‘ while @entity7 will always be a special nephew , i was happy to let @entity25 and @entity46 deal with the nappies and sleepless nights while i went back to my studies			1
’ the sisters are telling their story to raise awareness of cervical cancer .			1

@entity25 , 31 , was left infertile after cervical cancer treatment
her sister @entity17 , 33 , stepped in to give birth to little @entity7
@entity17 moved in with @entity25 , husband @entity46 and @entity7 for first week
