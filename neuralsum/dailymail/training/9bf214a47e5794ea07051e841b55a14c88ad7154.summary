@entity0 says her daughter @entity1 is in desperate need of specialist care after anorexia caused her weight to fall to 6st and destroyed one of her kidneys a mother says she is in a ' race against the clock ' to save her anorexic daughter 's life - but fears the @entity13 will not give her the help she needs			1
@entity0 , says her daughter @entity1 is in desperate need of specialist care after the illness destroyed one of her kidneys and left her weighing just six stone			1
despite the devastating effect on her health , she claims mental health officials have so far failed to arrange appropriate care for her , which has resulted in repeated emergency admissions to general wards			1
' every day , @entity25 wakes up and asks herself " will i die today " , ' she said			0
' she needs far more help from the @entity13 or she will die			0
they ’re not giving her the care she needs and this has been going on about two years			2
' she ’s had about 25 emergency admissions in that time and we ’re just going round in circles			2
' i feel like i ’m racing against the clock to get her the right treatment			0
' ms @entity0 wants her daughter to be in an eating disorder unit with the right specialists giving her the attention she needs			1
' we ’ve been told she will definitely need dialysis and a kidney transplant but she ’ll need to be in a better physical state before that happens - and she ca n’t do that without more help , ' she added			1
@entity1 , 26 , who lives with her mother in @entity48 , @entity49 , has been under the care of the @entity51 , but this does not cater for patients with acute problems			1
ms @entity0 added : ' the eating disorder service just is n’t equipped to deal with cases as complex as @entity1 ’s , who is also bipolar and has type two bulimia			1
' i think they are starting to realise that she needs proper 24 - hour care and they ’re now trying to get her into the @entity63 in @entity64 , a specialist unit , but we ’re still waiting			1
' i ’ve heard people say that she should just eat but it ’s a mental illness and it ’s not that simple			2
' despite weighing a healthy 10st before she was diagnosed five years ago , @entity25 ’s health has rapidly deteriorated and , at 5ft 5in tall , she now weighs 6st			2
with a body mass index ( @entity71 ) of just 14 , which is well below the recommended minimum of 18.5 , her condition has become so severe that her stomach automatically repels food			0
her mother says she has had to fight untill she was ' blue in the face ' for the @entity13 to provide a peg - feed , which can be inserted through her stomach			1
but when @entity1 ’s mental state deteriorates , she stops using the feed , which results in her being rushed to hospital with renal failure , due to dehydration and low potassium levels			1
@entity1 said : ' i wake up every day in tears and every morning i ask myself " will i die today ? " @entity1 has been admitted to hospital several times and , at times , has to be fed through a tube in her stomach ms @entity0 said : ' i feel like i 'm racing against the clock to get her the right treatment ' ' i desperately want help but the hospital does n't know what to do with me			1
' they do n’t seem to understand my illness and i feel like they think i ’m being selfish and choosing not to eat			0
' but it ’s not a choice - it ’s a mental illness			1
there ’s so much ignorance surrounding anorexia and bulimia and that makes it so much harder to recover			0
i want nothing more than to get better but i feel so alone			0
' @entity106 is a physical illness as well as a mental one and the mental health ward only offers me therapy			0
' i need to be in a proper eating disorder unit that specialises in treating people with the illness			2
if they do n’t address the problem soon i will die			0
' @entity1 said : ' i wake up every day in tears and every morning i ask myself " will i die today ? " ' @entity48 with @entity117 said the @entity51 will be a priority in its commissioning plans for 2015/16			2
in a statement provided to @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 at @entity124 , said : ' the trust ’s @entity123 service provides assessment and treatment interventions within the community , for people presenting with a primary eating disorder			0
' the team works closely with other organisation including the @entity126 to support service users who may require secondary care services			0
