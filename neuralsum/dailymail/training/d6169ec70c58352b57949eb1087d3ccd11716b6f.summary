by @entity0 despite its reputation , stress can cause us to lead a healthier lifestyle , according to a new research			1
five experiments showed that while stress can cause some people to overeat or indulge in a spending spree , it can cause just as many people to do more exercise or eat healthily , too			1
scientists found that people tend to rely on the habits they have already formed rather than automatically turning to destructive behaviour when put under pressure			1
the findings suggest that we do not have finite resources for self - discipline and that in fact we can control ourselves just as much when stressed as when relaxed			2

gym goers turn to exercise to get them through tough times ' when we try to change our behaviour , we strategise about our motivation and self - control , ' said @entity30 , provost professor of psychology and business at @entity32			0
' but what we should be thinking about instead is how to set up new habits			2
habits persist even when we 're tired and do n't have the energy to exert self - control			2
' @entity38 is a leading expert on habit , the automatic behaviours that make it possible for us to function each day			2
learned habits also play a big role in our health - research has shown that exercise , overeating and smoking are significant risk factors for major diseases			1
but while most disease prevention efforts focus on self - control , the latest research from @entity38 shows that the best way to prevent disease might be knowing how to let go : ' everybody gets stressed			2
' the focus on controlling your behaviour may not actually be the best way to get people to meet goals			0
if you are somebody who does n't have a lot of willpower , our study showed that habits are even more important			0
' in one experiment professor @entity38 and colleagues followed students for a term , including during exams			0
stress is traditionally associated with increased smoking and drinking but just as many people engage in healthy behaviour to get through stress			1
research has shown that learned habits play a large role in our present and future health they found that during exams , when students were stressed and sleep - deprived , they were even more likely to stick to old habits			1
it was as if they did n't have the energy to do something new , professor @entity38 explained			0
students who ate unhealthy breakfasts during the term â € “ such as pastries or doughnuts â € “ ate even more of the junk food during exams			0
but the same was true of healthy eaters : those in the habit of eating a healthy breakfast were also more likely to stick to their routine and ate especially well in the morning when under pressure			1
# similarly , students who had a habit of reading the newspaper everyday during the term were more likely to perform this habit during exams â € “ even when they were limited in time			0
and regular gym - goers were even more likely to go to the gym when stressed			0
' you might expect that , when students were stressed and had little time , they would n't read the paper at all , but instead they fell back on their reading habits , ' said @entity38			0
' habits do n't require much willpower and thought and deliberation			0
' @entity38 concluded : ' so , the central question for behaviour change efforts should be , how can you form healthy , productive habits ? ' what we know about habit formation is that you want to make the behaviour easy to perform , so that people repeat it often and it becomes part of their daily routine			1
' all five experiments appeared in the @entity136 .			1

studies *published* in the @entity136 , found existing lifestyle determined what people do to cope under pressure
experts said that best way to prevent turning to unhealthy behaviours such as comfort eating or smoking was to get into healthy habits when relaxed
@entity152 habits and lifestyle play a key role in our mental and *physical* health
