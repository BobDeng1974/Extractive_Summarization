the tourist spacecraft that could blast passengers into space for just $ 95,000 and let them sit in the cockpit is nearing completion , the firm behind it has revealed			1
passengers in the @entity8 will be able to view the earth from over 330,000ft above the @entity10 in the two seater craft			1
these pictures reveal the @entity13 is entering the final stages of production - and is expected to blast off in 2016 , despite fears that the tragic accident that hit rival @entity18 could delay the industry as a whole			1
its @entity8 spacecraft , illustration pictured , seats two people - the passenger and a pilot - and tickets cost $ 95,000 ( £ 57,000 )			1
this is almost two thirds the price of sir @entity39 's @entity38 there are just 15 seconds between lighting the engines and take off			2
then , 50 seconds after lighting the engines you go supersonic and very close to vertical and are pushed back in your seat			2
three minutes after lighting the engines you are at 180,000ft			2
the craft travels at @entity45 before the engines cut off and coasts to peak altitude of 350,000ft more than 200 tickets for a trip already been sold for the spacecraft that takes off and lands vertically using its reusable rocket propulsion system			1
' the @entity8 suborbital spacecraft continues to make rapid progress towards final assembly , ' the firm said			1
' immediately after bonding the cockpit to the fuselage the shop crews set up for the delicate and precise operation of bonding the carry - through spar on to the rear end of the @entity8 fuselage			1
to correctly locate the spar , the @entity8 rocket truss was temporarily removed from its own test stand and placed on the vehicle itself for the first time technicians spent several days carefully aligning the spar to ensure perfect symmetry , then began to bond it in place			1
' this was our @entity75 present , ' says @entity8 composites shop manager @entity77			1
' we applied the final glue layers on wednesday just before the holiday , and removed the support equipment over the weekend			0
we 're looking forward to the next big step , integration of the wing strakes onto the @entity8			1
' after the spar was installed the entire structure , from front to back was load tested to the equivalent of @entity90 re-entry , while in the test area the cabin was pressurized to 11 @entity93 , the first pressure test after being bonded to the fuselage			0
' the carry - through spar is the heart of the loading structure on any winged craft – it supports the primary load of the wings and carries that load through the fuselage , ' says @entity8 ceo @entity102			1
' attaching the spar on a composite vehicle is a one - way operation , so it has to be done right the first time			2
' ' we 're really excited to have achieved this step			0
it paves the way for the strakes to be attached as the next step			0
' thanks to the hard work of the composites crew , we 're proceeding at a very rapid pace toward first flight			0
' the spacecraft is quickly taking shape at the firm 's @entity27 headquarters this graphic explains what happens during the 30 - minute flight			1
around 50 seconds after the engines are lit , the craft goes supersonic			1
around three minutes after lighting the engine , passengers reach 180,000ft			2
craft travels at @entity45 before the engines cut off and coasts to peak altitude of 350,000ft @entity102 is convinced making space travel financially viable is the key to exploring the skies			1
he said : ' we have to go a couple of levels deeper than passion			0
when you look at the question of why it is so many years after we first went to space yet so little of it is being used , it 's because it just costs too much			2
' we have to do something to fundamentally reduce the cost before space becomes an economic good			2
we looked at that problem and not having a billionaire writing your cheques , it had to be a money making proposition			0
' passengers will put on white space suits two hours before boarding the spacecraft and embarking on the 30 - to 50 - minute flight			1
@entity160 , a vice president at @entity8 , said things move very quickly : ' there is just 15 seconds between lighting the engines and take off			2
then 50 seconds after lighting the engines you go supersonic and very close to vertical and are pushed back in your seat			0
then three minutes after lighting the engines you are at 180,000ft			0
' @entity102 continued : ' you are going more or less straight up at about @entity45			0
' then the engines cut off and you have about a minute and a half of zero gravity as you coast up to our peak altitude of 350,000ft - then another minute and a half of coasting back down until there is enough atmosphere for the vehicle to feel it			0
' the @entity8 aircraft has four engines , pictured , as well as rocket pumps and a propulsion bay			2
passengers sit in the pressure cabin			0
the first model will take travellers 200,000ft up but the company hopes the second model will reach 300,000ft and it will not be too long before they are ready to reach maximum altitude of 350,000ft he said re-entry then takes about a minute and the craft glides to land in approximately 20 minutes			2
the spacecraft , which will be able to fly four times a day , seats just the pilot and the passenger will be expected to get involved during the adventure			1
they will be asked to perform tasks , such as reading instruments and making sure dials are holding steady			0
' it 's your flight so if there is some particular part of the earth that you want to look at we can steer the ship to look at the @entity207 or the area you find of most interest , ' @entity160 added			0
' then you have time to look around and soak up being where so few have been before			0
' the first model will take travellers 200,000ft above the @entity10 , but the company hopes the second model will reach 300,000ft and it will not be too long before they are ready to take to the skies and reach maximum altitude of 350,000ft			0
' we expect to be in flight tests by the end of the year , after the first tests we wo n't know how long until we are ready to take the first passengers but my guess is six to 18 months			0
the @entity8 aircraft and its jet propulsion system , pictured , is still undergoing tests			1
@entity8 claims the first public flights should launch in between six and 18 months ' i think we will be flying participants by the end of next year but we do n't like to put a date on things , ' @entity160 said			1
there are also very few physical limitations , so even those in poor health may be able to travel			0
' some people can not handle the excitement , some people are claustrophobic , so we take them in a high performance aeroplane to test if they have a psychological problem but in the broad sense , if you can on a rollercoaster , you can do this because the time you are doing it is short			0
' it means people in ill health who want to do this while they still can are able to , ' added @entity160			0
@entity26 is housed in a small former @entity253 base at the @entity27 in @entity28 .			1

@entity26 is based at the @entity27 in @entity28 , *alongside* @entity18 's hq
@entity8 spacecraft seats two people and flights will travel up to 330,000ft and last between 30 and 50 minutes
tickets for the trip cost $ 95,000 ( £ 57,000 ) - and @entity8 will offer four flights a day
craft is undergoing tests and first public flights should launch in by 2016
