by @entity0 published : 10:30 est , 18 february 2013 updated : 15:07 est , 18 february 2013 @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 are among a number of celeb supporting a new campaign to encourage more women around the world to breast feed to save their baby 's life			1
according to @entity13 , 830,000 babies could be saved every year - that 's 95 every hour - if mothers across the globe breastfed within the first hour of giving birth			1
breast milk provides a newborn with vital antibodies which make them stronger and less likely to catch fatal diseases			1
yet in numerous third world countries women are using formula milk instead - even though they can barely afford it			1
sad story : myleene with young mother @entity26 who lost a baby to pneumonia because she did n't realise she could breastfeed @entity1 visited the slums of @entity30 in the @entity31 to meet some of the young mothers struggling to raise their children in appalling conditions			1
she was moved to tears when she met one woman , @entity26 , 20 , whose bottle - fed baby had recently died of pneumonia when he was just seven months old			0
in a video you can view below , @entity26 tells @entity1 she did n't realise she could breastfeed and instead went hungry herself to buy expensive milk formula			2
@entity1 said : ' i was really shocked that @entity26 did n't have access to the basic information that may have saved her son 's life			2
' the information is out there but it does n't seem to be hitting this part of the world			0
it 's very frustrating and very sad that another mum has gone through this			0
' appalling conditions : the presenter was shocked by the standard of living in this part of the @entity31 hope : children like this one are more likely to survive if they are breastfed from birth @entity13 have found that that many mothers like @entity26 are relying on expensive formula milk , when they could provide a much better source of nourishment for their babies themselves , because they simply are n't aware of the health benefits of breastfeeding			1
the charity 's chief executive @entity67 said : ' despite the benefits of breastfeeding being widely known in the developed world , and it being a free , natural way to protect a newborn baby , too little attention is being paid to help mums breastfeed in poorer countries			0
' @entity1 breastfed her own daughters , @entity78 , five and hero , 23 months			0
she said in today 's @entity80 : ' every mum wants the best for their children			0
i grew up in the @entity85 so i knew what my children needed as babies and i could make an informed choice about whether to breast or bottlefeed			2
' in the @entity31 , people do n’t have that knowledge			0
they often do n’t even have the facilities to boil water for mixing with formula milk			2
' @entity1 meets a newborn on her trip : the mother - of - two wants women in other countries to have the same access to information on breastfeeding that she had the problem is n't just in the @entity31 , the number of women breastfeeding is declining across @entity106 and in some @entity108 countries such as @entity109 and @entity110			0
@entity13 blame the problem on ' the prevalence of traditional practices as well as a severe shortage of health workers and examples of inappropriate marketing techniques by some baby milk substitute companies			1
' @entity1 added : ' it comes down to a combination of factors , including a lack of health workers to give good advice , lack of education and marketing practices of some firms who , according to some mums i spoke to , convince them that formula is better			1
' the charity are seeking to make women more aware that breast is best by highlighting the importance of breastfeeding in the first hour of a baby 's life			0
the charity state : ' if babies receive colostrum – the mother ’s first milk – within an hour of birth , it will kick start the child ’s immune system , making them three times more likely to survive			2
and , if the mother continues feeding for the next six months , then a child growing up in the developing world is up to 15 times less likely to die from killer diseases like pneumonia and diarrhoea			0
' change for the better : @entity1 meets single mother @entity155 , 18 , and her child @entity156 , aged 4 months , in @entity30			0
the young mother used to use formula but is now being taught that breast is best the charity sent actress @entity3 to the slums of @entity162 , @entity163 , to see how action there has already been saving lives			1
' over past 20 years the government have slashed the infant mortality rate by over 50 per cent and one of the ways they 've done that is using a unique superfood - breast milk , ' she said			1
@entity2 was among celebs who joined @entity1 and @entity174 by tweeting her support of the campaign today writing : ' as a mother i know how crucial the first hour of a baby life 's is			1
this is why i 'm supporting @ savethechildren # firsthour			0
' mr @entity67 explained : ' if every baby was fed during the first hour of life – what we call the ' power hour ' – we estimate that up to 830,000 newborn deaths could be prevented every year ; that ’s 95 babies every hour			2
and if mums were helped to breastfeed for up to six months , many more children would be protected from killer diseases like pneumonia and diarrhoea			0
it is a matter of life and death			0
' in a report published today , called @entity201 , @entity13 call on the government to use their @entity204 presidency in june to fund breastfeeding nutrition work			2
they also want baby formula companies such as @entity208 and @entity209 to give over a third of their product packaging to warnings of the potential health risks of not breastfeeding			1
they have found that some formula companies in @entity106 have violated the internationally agreed code for the marketing of breast milk substitutes by implying it 's better than the real thing			1
