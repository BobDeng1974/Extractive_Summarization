' it was just very sad to see innocent kids being killed , ' @entity0 said			2
' i can only imagine what the parents are going through			0
@entity0 has announced that he will donate the £ 30,000 shorts he wore during his last week to charity @entity0 posted two pictures of his refurbished gym and clothes from his fight with @entity13 @entity0 was all smiles as he talked to the assembled press at his gym in @entity31 ' i want to donate the shorts for the @entity4 cause , rebuild a school and strengthen security around the area			1
' we are very lucky in @entity38			0
we have good security and i will be able to send my little girl to school and know she will be fine but in @entity5 you can not do that , ' said @entity0			1
' they send the kids outside the house and do not know if they are going to come back			0
' @entity0 's shorts were designed by @entity48 , owner of @entity49 , and feature a 24 carat gold thread woven through a waist band supporting white nappa leather trunks with crocodile trim			1
ms. @entity48 explained the detailed process behind the shorts last week			0
' we were n't originally planning to do the 24 carat gold shorts , but then we had a very exciting opportunity with a new company called @entity60 , ' she told @entity61			1
' they have a thousand exclusive members who can order any kind of clothing they wish , which can then be customised with 24 carat gold			2
@entity0 is hoping his next fight will be against @entity69 next year @entity0 lands a left hand during his impressive win on decision against @entity13 ' @entity0 is one of their members so we then got talking and it was agreed we could use the 24 carat gold to make the waistband for his shorts			1
' the outside of the shorts are covered in lamb nappa leather with crocodile trim , and then the lining is 100 per cent silk , so you have to combine all those materials through different machines - so it was a jigsaw to put them all together			2
' but i want every fighter to be unique and have unusual fabrics - so it was worth it			2
' we started about four months ago on the training kit and then we were brainstorming ideas before putting pen to paper			0
' it 's probably been a four to six week period process to piece it all together and finalising all the designs for the fight night shorts			0
' it 's been a really exciting process working with @entity0			2
at @entity49 i want to create people 's dream shorts and make them a reality to wear			0
when you look good you feel good , and then you fight better too			0
' whether or not we had the material from 24kt we still strive to make unusual , unique fabrics and there 's so many more different styles and trends to explore - that 's why i 'm in this business			0
' the trunks , made specially for the fight , have genuine 24 carat gold thread woven into the waistband the 28 - year - old 's shorts are worth £ 30,000 and were on show during the fight with the @entity14			1
