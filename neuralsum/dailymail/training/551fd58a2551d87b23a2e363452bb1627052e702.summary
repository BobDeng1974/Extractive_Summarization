whether i am taking a mini-break , flying long - haul or heading to a business meeting , my way of getting through the trauma of 21st century travel is to put on my safari suit and retro sunglasses and act as if this is still the heyday of @entity10			1
@entity11 lends itself to my peculiar fantasies perfectly - a seamless blend of old world and new world , @entity16 and @entity17 , with a @entity19 social life			1
all of my fashion friends have been raving about it for years , so i jumped on a three - hour flight to discover it for myself			2
even after being met by traffic worse than @entity30 at rush hour en route to my hotel ( brace yourself and double any estimated journey times you may have read about ) , the heat , bustle and chaos of this city of more than 14million bodies will have anyone 's sense of adventure stirred			1
@entity39 , but not as you know it : the serious party - goer can find clubs in fine locations in burgeoning @entity11 in an effort to stay off the beaten track , i started in @entity46 , the antiques area			1
the quiet streets are filled with mix of adorable bric - a - brac shops alongside serious dealers			2
@entity52 fashion shops also pepper the neighbourhood , alongside the bizarre rather than the bazaar			0
if textiles and linens are your thing catch a cab , as i did , to @entity62 - designer @entity61 's bath store in the @entity63 , which sells antique kaftans and waffle dressing gowns			1
the bazaar is both overwhelming and incredible - a very different shopping experience from the souks of @entity69			2
but unless you are after the traditional , do n't spend too much time here			0
rather than being sucked into buying fake @entity73 slippers , seek out the @entity75 carpet slipper sellers and haggle like a demon			0
my base for the long weekend was the @entity78			0
this new hotel is the first in a procession of pleasure palaces trickling along the @entity83			0
it stands next to the prime minister 's house , meaning the environs are crawling with police at all times			2
cutting a dash : @entity91 spent a long weekend soaking up the sights and shops of the former @entity94 at first i was alarmed by the level of airport - style security in the big hotels , but it 's standard here			1
the @entity78 's large rooms are decorated with typical five - star global good taste , and the staff are beyond helpful			1
this is the hotel to stay in if you 're getting out to see @entity11 every day - there is no outside space , or resort - style pool for lounging , but it does have a great spa , with hammam treatments for those too exhausted , or not brave enough , to try one in the old town			1
making an effort to get up early each day , i scoffed my menemen - traditional @entity75 scrambled eggs with green peppers and tomatoes - before venturing out			2
if brunch is more your thing , head to @entity122 , particularly the terrace of the @entity124 on sundays			1
@entity122 used to be a fairly run - down area but it has been transformed over recent years			1
its ancient , hilltop streets now form the beating heart of the city			2
if you are staying in @entity11 for only a few days , @entity122 should be your base , because it has excellent bars , clubs and restaurants as well as some of best shops			1
@entity143 to the @entity140 boutique , whose collection is worn by the cream of @entity11 ( lace was dominant on my visit - beautifully structured shift dresses , and chic contemporary separates ) , then work your way through the surrounding streets , discovering pop - up shops and designer outlets ( i loved @entity150 , a sweet independent shoe store )			1
do n't forget to haggle : you can find bargains , if you know where and how to look , in @entity11 's historic markets exhausted from shopping , i later stopped at the airy @entity156 for a tasty pistachio @entity75 pastry and a cappuccino			1
nestled directly below is @entity160 , the district intent on stealing @entity122 's crown in becoming the coolest part of the city			1
on the banks of the @entity83 , this former industrial area , with its fabulous restaurants and galleries , is book - ended by the bridge to the old town and @entity170			2
this is a brilliantly curated contemporary museum , and you can whip around it in 30 minutes			0
that 's just as well , as contemporary art can leave me quite weary			2
after my whistlestop tour , i headed for the museum 's terrace restaurant , recommended to me by the former fashion editor of @entity39 as the place where the @entity181 girls lunch			1
simple salads and mezze proved an ideal recovery tactic			0
i would also recommend the pideli kofte - grilled meatballs in yogurt and tomato sauce			2
@entity160 is definitely the place for foodies			1
the @entity191 cafe kicked off the area 's food revolution - it 's an adorable place with a great selection of world coffees and pastries , with vines overhead and little outside tables			1
meeting up with some @entity202 friends for dinner , we tried @entity204			0
between us we managed to order most things on the menu , with the succulent griddled lamb the pick of the bunch			0
going up in the world : the @entity122 district of @entity11 is increasingly hip , and enjoys a lovely riverside location with our bellies full , it was time to sample @entity11 's bustling nightlife			1
this really is a party city , and i love a party			2
a quick taxi ride to @entity220 , just past the @entity221 , you will find a cluster of outdoor clubs that have as good a summer party vibe as any in @entity226			0
we made for the biggest of them , @entity228			0
walking down the steps in the club to the tables , all eyes are on you , so put on your best show			0
for me , that meant a showgirl high kick on the last step ( we had enjoyed a lot of cocktails by this point ) , that nearly took out the first table			0
the music is hilarious , but give in to it - every big @entity16 and @entity244 club track has a @entity75 beat mixed over it			2
i will never be able to listen to @entity247 's @entity246 in quite the same way again			2
despite the political troubles associated with @entity251 , here you 'll find the best late - night kebabs to soak up the booze			2
i could n't tell you which chic shop we visited - perhaps that 's a sign of how hard we had partied			1
of course , you can not come to a city like @entity11 and not visit the big attractions			1
we took a private boat to see the @entity262 and @entity263 - the bigger hotels will be happy to organise this			1
the @entity262 's influence on @entity16 ecclesiastical architecture can not be overstated enough , so for an architectural enthusiast like me it was an essential trip			0
a blaze of noise and colour : @entity11 's @entity63 can be a fun , merrily chaotic , shopping experience the @entity263 is impressive , though less relevant to the @entity16 architectural enthusiast			1
due to the heat , i was wearing seersucker shorts , and thus was given an ankle - length blue skirt with a @entity278 split to wear inside the building			0
i had to muster all my strength not to do an @entity282 side - leg pose at every photo opportunity			0
most impressive for me was the vast @entity284 , the main residence of the @entity286 sultans for 400 years			0
the palace is the perfect metaphor for old @entity11 - a blend of @entity291 imperialism and @entity16 influence , so beautifully preserved that wandering around , you feel like @entity294			1
naturally , i burst into songs from the @entity297 classic at regular intervals			0
walking through the vast harem ( a separate ticket , but worth adding ) , you can almost hear the giggles of the concubines , and the squealing of the eunuchs			0
the palace is huge , so do n't attempt to do it all in a day			0
i headed straight for the jewels			0
having watched @entity308 and @entity311 's @entity310 - winning 1964 film @entity312 with my grandparents as a child , i made a beeline for the @entity312 dagger - its enormous emeralds would make anyone want to break the glass and cart it off			1
the gaudiness of the endless rooms of the @entity323 make our own @entity324 look almost demure : baskets of emeralds , gold thrones studded with diamonds , intricate treasure boxes and the 85 - carat pear - shaped @entity329 the @entity330 wore as a ring			0
do n't go there before visiting the @entity63 or you may come back decked out like @entity336			0
@entity11 is a burgeoning , lively and deliciously contemporary city , set to a backdrop of thousands of years of history			1
this cultural blend has been its appeal for hundreds of years , and there is no better time to dip into its fashionable society			0
@entity346 ( www.coxandkings.co.uk , 020 7873 5000 ) offers three nights ' b&b at the @entity349 from Â£ 995 per person including return flights and transfers			0
the price is valid until october 31 , 2014 .			0
