by @entity0 published : 20:05 est , 6 may 2012 updated : 20:05 est , 6 may 2012 @entity1 : the @entity2 said the amount being claimed on benefits was ' absurd ' more than 11,000 households are raking in benefits that are at least the equivalent of a higher rate taxpayers ’ £ 47,000 salary , it has been revealed			1
the figure was disclosed by @entity2 @entity1 before letters are sent to households this week explaining a new cap on benefits under which no one can claim more than the average annual working wage of £ 26,000			1
the cap comes into force next april and aims to remove the disincentive to work that leaves many of the unemployed better off on benefits			1
mr @entity1 said : ‘ for more than ten years @entity22 let the benefits bill soar , and these figures show the scale of the problem			1
‘ it is absurd that people are able to claim as much on benefits as a higher rate taxpayer earns			1
‘ the welfare state should work as a safety net and then support people to financial independence			0
‘ that is why i am writing to benefit recipients , to let them know that we will be working with them over the coming year to give them every support to find work and become self - sufficient			0
' our welfare reforms will make sure a life in work always pays more than a life on benefits , and are a clear illustration that this government is on the side of people who work hard , do the right thing and aspire to a better life			2
’ the 11,000 households exposed by mr @entity1 enjoy benefits of more than £ 34,000 a year , equating to a gross wage of £ 47,000			1
this is enough to put most employees into the higher rate 40p tax band			0
this week the government will write to 67,000 households that could be affected by having their benefits reduced to the £ 26,000 limit , spelling out the support available to find work			1
' a basic issue of fairness ' : @entity70 according to official figures , at least 100 families on benefits are living in luxury homes , with many receiving housing handouts of about £ 5,000 per month – enough to fund a £ 1million mortgage			2
households exempt from the cap include those where there are people in work and claiming working tax credits , and families that are deemed to be very vulnerable – including war widows and those claiming disability living allowance			1
people who have lost their job but were employed for 12 months or more prior to claiming benefits will have nine months ’ grace before the cap applies			1
@entity94 , of the @entity95 ’ @entity93 , said : ‘ many taxpayers struggling to make ends meet will find it incredibly unfair that some people are drawing more in benefits than they ’ve ever actually earned themselves			2
‘ the welfare system needs to provide a safety net for the poorest and most vulnerable in society , but these figures demonstrate that the current system has got out of control and that the government ’s proposed benefits cap needs to be introduced as a matter of urgency			2
’ the prime minister has also said it is ‘ time to call time ’ on excessive benefits			0
@entity70 said in january : ‘ it ’s a basic issue of fairness			0
should people really be able to earn more than £ 26,000 just through benefits alone ? ‘ i do n’t believe they should			1
and i think the overwhelming majority of people in the country would back that view			0
’ ministers will overhaul the tax and benefits system from october next year , when a universal credit will be introduced to simplify the system and replace swathes of tax credits and benefits			2
they claim it will ensure that no one will be better off on benefits than in work , removing the so - called ‘ cliff edge ’ where those who take on part - time work end up worse off as benefits are removed			0
but critics have warned that families affected by the benefits cap could lose their homes , as around 44 per cent of those set to be hit are living in social housing			2
@entity145 , of the @entity146 , said : ‘ the letters will come as a shock to many vulnerable families			0
the overall benefit cap is a crude measure that fails to reflect the stark differences in housing costs across the country caused by the desperate shortage of affordable housing			0
’ he called on councils to share information they had on who could be affected so that housing associations could offer help			0
‘ with under a year to go before many people start losing their homes , there ’s no time to lose , ’ he added .			0
