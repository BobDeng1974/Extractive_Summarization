a new image released by @entity1 reveals a previously unseen view of @entity3 and its rings using a navigation technique called a ' pi transfer '			1
the picture was taken by the space agency ’s @entity9 probe during a flyby past the planet 's largest moon @entity12 when it was about 764,000 miles ( 1.23 million km ) from @entity3			1
a pi transfer uses the gravity of the moon to alter the orbit of the @entity9 so it can gain different perspectives on @entity3 and achieve a wide variety of science objectives			1
this @entity1 picture taken on january 19 , 2007 , shows a view of @entity3 and its rings - the visible documentation of a technique called a ' pi transfer ' completed with a @entity12 flyby @entity1 said taking in the rings in their entirety was the focus of this particular imaging sequence			1
therefore , the camera exposure times were just right to capture the dark - side of its rings , but longer than that required to properly expose the globe of sunlit @entity3			2
as a result , the sunlit half of the planet is overexposed			0
the view is a mosaic of 36 images - that is , 12 separate sets of red , green and blue images - taken over the course of about 2.5 hours , as @entity9 scanned across the entire main ring system			0
this view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 40 degrees above the ring plane			0
among the interplay of @entity3 's shadow and rings , @entity56 , which appears in the lower - right corner of the image , orbits @entity3 as a set of the ever - intriguing spokes appear in the b ring ( just to the right of centre ) the images in this natural - color view were obtained with the @entity9 wide - angle camera at a distance of approximately 1.23 million km from @entity3			1
image scale is 70 kilometers ( 44 miles ) per pixel			0
last week @entity1 released pictures taken on october 22 , 2013 , which showed the planet ’s dazzling rings in unprecedented detail , along with its ' @entity76 ' moon seen glowing in the distance			1
the planet ’s @entity78 , also known as the ‘ @entity76 ’ because of its resemblance to the space station , is visible as a pin prick of light at the bottom right			0
the image also shows the mysterious ‘ spokes ’ in @entity3 's b ring , just to the right of centre			1
an image taken by @entity9 in 2012			2
a shadow cast by @entity91 across the a ring as @entity3 's own shadow block light from the lower part of the rings ( bottom right )			2
@entity9 captured the view at a distance of approximately 1.1 million miles from @entity3 @entity3 and her rings as the rings cast shadows on the planet			1
@entity1 's probe @entity9 captured the view at a distance of approximately 621,000 miles from @entity3 in a talk at @entity109 in december , professor @entity106 of @entity107 said he noticed a strange bend when poring over images on from @entity1 's @entity9 spacecraft			1
the mysterious object , which was located at the right edge of @entity3 's a ring , has been named ' @entity116 ' after professor @entity106 's mother - in - law @entity56 is an inner moon of @entity3 and averages 246 miles ( 396 km ) in diameter			1
@entity56 and another @entity3 moon , @entity123 , have been called ‘ the most heavily cratered body in the solar system			2
’ based on data gathered from the @entity9 spacecraft , scientists last year estimated that @entity3 ’s rings date back more than four billion years			1
its images have provided some surprises for scientists in the past few years			0
for instance in a talk at @entity109 in december , professor @entity106 of @entity107 said he noticed a strange bend when poring over images on from @entity1 ’s @entity9 spacecraft			2
the mysterious object , which was located at the right edge of @entity3 ’s a ring , has been named ‘ @entity116 ’ after professor @entity106 ’s mother - in - law			0
@entity116 is thought to be about a 0.6 miles ( 1km ) in diameter , which experts claim is too small for it to be a moon			0
it could , however , be the build - up of ring material that has collapsed gravitationally under its own weight			0
some of @entity3 ’s moons , particularly those orbiting near the rings , are thought to have formed in this way , creating a ring of dust then collecting more material to grow			0
the planet is known to have of 53 natural rings with two orbiting within gaps in the main rings			0
some moons , such as @entity158 and @entity159 , interact with ring material , shepherding the ring in its orbit .			0
