by @entity0 safety car periods will be followed by standing race restarts from the grid next season , @entity2 's governing body announced on thursday			1
the measure , which replaces rolling restarts , is aimed at making grands prix more exciting but has been criticised by some drivers			1
' i understand the start is one of the most exciting times for the fans but it sounds very extreme and i hope it 's not going to be done			2
it 's going too far with things , ' @entity18 ' championship leader @entity17 said at last weekend 's @entity21			1
on track : safety car periods will be followed by standing race restarts from the grid next season the @entity26 said in a statement that its @entity28 had agreed the change to the 2015 sporting regulations			1
' safety car restarts will now be a standing start from the grid , ' it said			1
' standing starts will not be carried out if the safety car is used within two laps of the start ( or restart ) of a race or if there are less than five laps of the race remaining			1
' @entity44 driver @entity43 of @entity45 was another unimpressed by the ' artificial ' proposal which was put forward by the @entity47 that brings together leading teams including his own			2
picture that : @entity17 , who won the @entity50 @entity21 and leads the championship , has been critical of the safety car ruling ' if it goes to a standing start the chance of not having a great start is pretty high so you could go from first to fourth			1
it 's just a bit too much of a disadvantage for someone who earned the lead in the first place , ' @entity43 said			2
other changes include measures to reduce costs in areas such as testing and design and to make cars more attractive than the current ' ugly - nosed ' ones			0
three pre-season tests of four days each will be scheduled in 2015 and restricted to @entity72 , ruling out more costly excursions to @entity74			2
in 2016 this will be reduced to two tests of four days each			0
there will also be two in - season tests of two days each , also in @entity72 , with two of the four days reserved for young drivers			0
starting grid : the pack will face standing restarts from 2015 wind tunnel testing will be limited to 65 hours a week , from 80 , and @entity85 ( @entity85 ) usage reduced			1
friday night personnel curfews at race weekends will be extended from six to seven hours next year and then eight in 2016			0
the @entity26 has also introduced new regulations to change the look of the cars ' noses for ' improved safety and to provide more aesthetically pleasing structures '			0
drivers will be limited to four engines per season instead of five , unless there are more than 20 races on the calendar , and parc ferme conditions will be enforced from the start of final practice on saturday rather than qualifying			0
a proposed ban on tyre blankets has been put on hold			0
the governing body added that any changes to sporting and technical regulations would in future require unanimous agreement from all parties from march 1 instead of the current cutoff of june 30 .			0

standing starts from the grid will follow safety car periods from 2015
the measure is aimed at making the racing more exciting
but new ruling has been criticised by @entity17 and @entity43
