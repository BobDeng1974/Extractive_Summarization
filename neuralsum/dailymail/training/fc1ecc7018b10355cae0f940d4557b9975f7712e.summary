the wreck of a @entity2 bomber that sunk during a raid on the @entity6 battleship , the @entity7 , has been found and is likely to contain the bodies of two of the missing crew			1
the @entity12 bomber was located perfectly intact 600ft down in a @entity14 fjord 72 years after it crashed on the mission to destroy one of @entity19 's most feared ships			1
the aircraft was struck by heavy flak and made a successful crash landing in the water inlet in northern @entity14			1
it is believed they drowned when the bomber went down			2
the children of @entity55 today told of their relief that the aircraft had been found but said his body should remain where it is			2
@entity60 was aged five when her father was killed in the raid on the @entity7 in 1942 while her brother @entity63 was not born as the airman 's widow , @entity64 , was two months pregnant at the time			1
in 1999 the two siblings made a pilgrimage to the fjord where the @entity12 crashed and laid flowers there , although they did n't know where exactly it was in the water			1
@entity73 , a 72 - year - old retired policeman from @entity74 , said : ' i am pleased and relieved it has now been discovered			0
' there is the prospect of his body being recovered and a funeral with full military honours taking place but it is a war grave and is his final resting place and maybe it should remain that way			1
' in 1999 someone pinpointed roughly where the @entity12 came down and our family went out there to pay our respects and lay some flowers			1
' mrs @entity60 , 75 , said : ' when i found out the aircraft had been found i was quite upset from my mother 's point of view			1
' it is a wonderful thing what they have done but that is their final resting place and that is where they should remain			0
' sgt @entity101 was a carpenter for @entity104 before the war and volunteered for the @entity106			2
he was aged 32 when he died			0
as he was the oldest member of the @entity12 crew , his comrades nicknamed him ' pops '			1
the pilot of the bomber , @entity111 , survived the war and died two years ago in @entity113 , @entity114			1
there have been numerous attempts to find @entity34 over the years with no joy until engineers laying a pipeline stumbled upon a mystery underwater object			1
the marine technology department at a local university was tipped off about it and a team of six students visited the fjord and sent a remote control submarine down to inspect the object			1
video footage beamed back to their vessel on the surface revealed the @entity12 bomber that had suffered barely any visible damage over the last seven decades			1
enemy target : the bomber was sunk while hunting the @entity6 battleship @entity7 , pictured here anchored at a fjord in @entity14 the @entity7 ( pictured ) was attacked on numerous occasions by the @entity140 and was finally sunk in november 1944 ferocious : the @entity6 battleship @entity7 being bombed by allied forces professor @entity143 , who lead the search although they could not find the aircraft 's serial number , given its location it is likely to be @entity34			1
the sunken bomber will be protected as a war grave because of the likelihood of the remains of the two airman still being on board			1
the bomber was part of @entity158 and took off from @entity159 on april 28 , 1942 , to find and sink the @entity7 , which was the heaviest ship in the world at the time			1
the ship was positioned off @entity14 to deter an @entity165 invasion of the @entity167 - occupied country as well as to intercept @entity169 convoys			1
in all , 23 @entity170 and 11 @entity171 took part in the sortie , with two being shot down by @entity6 anti-aircraft defences			0
it is known that @entity34 has been unable to release its mines when over the target and the pilot , @entity179 , came around again for a second attempt			1
it 's port wing was hit and caught fire at 4,000ft , causing the aircraft to rapidly lose height			2
the pilot managed to ditch it in a fjord and three of the six crew got out and climbed into the life raft			2
tail gunner @entity192 went to look for his two missing comrades but had to retreat into the dinghy as the plane quickly sank			2
they drifted for three hours until two @entity14 men rowed out to rescue them			1
they were handed over to the @entity6 when they came ashore and spent the rest of the war in pow camps in @entity6			2
professor @entity143 , of the marine technology department at the @entity204 , said : ' it was a construction company which found the plane initially			2
they did n't realise it was there or what it was			0
@entity211 told the story of the allied effort to sink the @entity7 using human torpedoes and mini submarines it took an incredible 24 operations over five years to destroy the @entity7			1
launched in 1939 , @entity7 was a truly monumental military machine			2
the length of 2Â½ football pitches , it was crewed by 2,600 men and armed with an astonishing array of weapons including 58 anti-aircraft cannons			0
the hull was protected by 13in armour plating while 5in thick decks protected the engine rooms and magazines			0
many believed the ship was unsinkable			0
for many years , it was			0
@entity234 was obsessed with the @entity7 , declaring : ' the whole strategy of the war turns on this ship			1
i regard the matter as of the highest urgency and importance			0
' for four years , he urged the service chiefs into finding and attacking this symbol of @entity167 might			0
on one memorable occasion , he wrote to the @entity247 : ' the crippling of this ship would alter the face of the war , and the loss of 100 machines or 500 airmen would be well compensated for			0
' in october 1942 , the @entity255 deployed its secret weapon , the optimistically named ' @entity257 '			0
the plan entailed two divers riding a self - propelled torpedo before detaching the warhead , fixing it to the hull , then making their escape			0
dreadful weather conspired to render the attack a failure			0
@entity268 submarines were deployed in september 1943 , but despite causing some damage , @entity7 stayed in action			2
in april 1944 , a massive raid was mounted by the @entity272 that resulted in the ship being ' peppered with bombs ' and the deaths of 122 @entity6 sailors			0
but still the mighty warship remained in service			0
in autumn 1944 , @entity279 and his @entity106 colleagues from @entity281 ( of @entity281 fame ) and @entity283 entered the fray			0
operating at the very limits of their endurance , modified @entity289 bombers were flown to a base in @entity291 , from where attacks could be mounted			0
finally , on november 12 , 1944 , a force of 30 @entity2 bombers , armed with massive 12,000lb ' @entity297 ' earthquake bombs , descended on @entity7 off the coast of @entity299 in @entity14			1
the crews delivered their huge payloads with great accuracy , death and destruction raining down on the pride of the @entity6 fleet			0
as the smoke and steam cleared , one @entity106 gunner in a rear turret reported : ' @entity312 , i think she 's keeling over			0
' @entity7 's war was finally at an end			1
of 1,700 sailors on board , nearly 1,000 perished in the explosions and the icy waters			2
countless @entity106 and @entity255 personnel had made the ultimate sacrifice to ensure its destruction			0
the endeavours of the human torpedoes and mini submarines were told in the 1955 film @entity326			0
@entity327 a @entity12 bomber - not the plane found in the fjord - is made ready by ground crew ( file picture ) a reconnaissance photo shows the @entity7 - the heaviest ship in the world at the time - at anchor research ship : the @entity338 was the vessel that found the bomber ' we went to the site and used a remote controlled underwater vehicle which dived to 180 metres			1
we could see from the images that it was the @entity12 and was in good condition			2
' we realised it might be a @entity2 war grave and were very careful and respectful			1
there were loud cheers when we discovered the plane			0
' the @entity353 and the @entity354 have been informed of the find			0
it is not clear as to what will happen next or if a search for the missing airmen will be carried out			0
@entity360 , the director of the museum , said : ' the aircraft is still owned by the @entity2 and is being looked after by @entity14 as it is in our waters			1
' we have reason to believe there maybe the remains of two airmen on board and by @entity14 law nobody is allowed to touch it without proper authority			1
' any search for the airmen would require divers and it would be up to the @entity2 authorities			0
' a spokesman for the @entity354 in @entity379 confirmed they had been made aware of the discovery and were consulting with the @entity106 's @entity382 as to how to proceed			0
the @entity7 was attacked on numerous occasions by the @entity140 and was finally sunk in november 1944 .			2

wreck of @entity40 bomber found in 600ft deep waters in @entity14
it crashed while on a mission to destroy one of @entity19 's most feared ships
while trying to sink the @entity7 , it was struck by heavy flak and came down
plane found when pipeline engineers stumbled upon a mystery object
six students sent a remote control submarine down to inspect the object
it turned out to be a @entity12 bomber , very likely to be @entity34
it will be protected as a war grave , as two crew members may be on board
