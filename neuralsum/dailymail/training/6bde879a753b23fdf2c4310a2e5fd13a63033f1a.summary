tens of thousands of @entity2 lined the streets to applaud , cheer and high - five the runners , who were followed by a truck blaring patriotic music			1
they stood and roared as @entity2 's @entity13 , who completed the men 's event in two hours , 12 minutes and 26 seconds , crossed the finish line			1

known officially as the @entity22 , the race was open to foreign amateurs this year for the first time			1
the race - held annually for 27 years - is sanctioned as a bronze - label event by the @entity48			2
organisers said they decided to allow foreign recreational runners because they wanted to hold a grander race as part of the series of sporting competitions , arts festivals and cultural events marking the birthday of the nation 's founder , @entity58 , on april 15			2
much of @entity2 remains off - limits to foreigners , but @entity6 , with its broad avenues , plazas and ubiquitous monuments , is more accessible than other places in the secretive and isolated country			2

the scenery was fantastic , and there were so many people watching ' @entity99 , 32 , a pregnant @entity100 from @entity101 living in @entity102 but they noted most were from tourists who primarily wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to see @entity6 close up , rather than compete in the race itself			1
officials said runners from 27 countries took part this year , including 225 amateurs			2
though the race has long featured elite athletes from around the world , organizers decided to make it easier for fun - runners to join in by requiring only that the course be completed in four hours - so the roads could be reopened - and by also holding a half marathon and a 10km run			1
‘ i really wanted to do this race because of the location , ’ said 10km runner @entity99 , a 32 - year - old @entity100 from @entity101 living in @entity102 , who is also four months pregnant			1
