by @entity0 published : 06:34 est , 9 january 2014 updated : 03:31 est , 10 january 2014 a @entity3 fan travelled across the country for eight years taking photographs of all 131 @entity7 street signs in @entity8			1
from rural lanes to inner - city estates and motorway sidings , @entity9 , 48 , crossed the length and breadth of the country to document each location where the famous street name could be found			1
the centrepiece of his collection is a picture from @entity7 in @entity21 , @entity22 , made famous by the 1969 @entity3 album of the same name			1
with over 130 signs across @entity8 bearing the @entity7 name , the photographer @entity9 had his work cut out for him in his successful attempt to capture every single one			1
pictured is the most famous one in @entity21 , @entity22 , taken september 2003 the iconic album cover for the @entity3 album @entity7 , taken outside the studio in which the album was recorded in @entity21 , @entity22			1
the album cover is said to contain cryptic messages about the band , with rumors including a long - standing conspiracy theory that @entity41 has been dead since 1966 mr @entity9 said inspiration for the project did not come from the iconic album cover , which features the @entity3 using the famous zebra crossing , but rather the @entity47 area near his home in south - east @entity22			1
he said : ' i was living near an @entity7			1
i ’ve been a fan of the @entity3 since my late teens and to be living near to an @entity7 - not the one made famous by the album , but a different one - tickled me			1
' i began to wonder how many there were in @entity8 , and thinking about how the @entity7 made famous by the @entity3 is a " first among equals "			2
' the thought inspired me to bring them together in a collection			2
i wondered if i could photograph them all			2

visiting around 16 locations a year , he would often make detours during cross-country journeys to provide opportunities to add to his collection			1
he said : ' my partner was supportive and patient			0
all the trips were done without a sat - nav system so occasionally she would be the navigator			0
she did n’t mind adding time on to a journey so i could visit another @entity7			2
' towards the end of the project we had a holiday where we took a tent and did 11 sites on the @entity96 in one week			0
' @entity97 had features in common			0
the rural sites sometimes had ruins nearby - the original abbey from which the road took its name			0
' others were found on council estates , where the name was just a name and had no relation to the surrounding area			0
one @entity7 actually turned out to be a motorway on - ramp			2
' it started out as mundane as trainspotting			0
but as the project grew , i noticed how the backgrounds became the focus of interest - the gardens , the roadsides , the broken walls			0
' when you view the photographs together , it looks distinctively @entity8			0
' the @entity7 street sign in @entity124 , @entity125 , taken in may 2004 the @entity7 signs in @entity127 , @entity128 ( left ) and @entity129 , @entity60 ( right ) both taken in 2005 mr @entity9 , who now lives in @entity72 in @entity71 , drew the project to a close in october 2011 once he had ticked off every site on his original list			1
he said : ' i ’ve no plans to extend the search to @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139			0
' the famous @entity7 is in @entity8			2
the @entity3 , the guys who made it famous , were @entity8			0
to have covered @entity8 is enough for me			0
' mr @entity9 used the 131 images to create a poster which has been purchased by @entity3 fans from as far afield as @entity145 , @entity146 and the @entity147 @entity9 's final piece , eight years and over 100 street signs , with the sign that inspired from outside the @entity151 in @entity21 in @entity152 the @entity7 street sign in @entity154 , @entity155 , taken in january 2004 the @entity7 street sign in @entity157 , @entity158 , taken in august 2009			1
