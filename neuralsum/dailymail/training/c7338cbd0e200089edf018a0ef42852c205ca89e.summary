by @entity0 thousands of @entity2 supporters packed fan parks across the country on thursday to cheer on the team during their last @entity7 clash against @entity8 with @entity14 in @entity15 full of people 15 minutes ahead of the big kick - off , the support @entity11 's side have received from home fans during this tournament shows just how big football is becoming stateside			1
those packed inside will have been disappointed with the 1 - 0 defeat at the hands of @entity8 but will have been delighted to progress after @entity23 's 2 - 1 win over @entity24 was n't enough to see @entity25 and co go through			1
this summer 's @entity29 in @entity53 looks to be the first one that really has @entity2 fans hooked - a whole 20 years on from when they hosted the tournament on their home soil at @entity2 ' 94			1
for once , rather than struggling to drum up support for the @entity50 ( @entity2 men 's @entity70 ) , fans are being turned away from fan parks as @entity2 attempt to drink in the relative successes of their national team on the big stage			1
a pre-tournament survey , carried out across 19 @entity53 - bound countries , showed @entity2 supporters as fans of one of only four nations that expected their team to win the @entity29 - alongside early favourites @entity82 , @entity53 and @entity84			2
celeb support : @entity86 , who counts himself as a @entity88 supporter , was seen geeing up fans at an event here and there : two of the @entity2 's 196,838 ticketholders in @entity53 cheer the team on against @entity23 big moment : @entity97 ' last minute header sent @entity2 fans - and players - into hysteria dejected : for a nation that calls the sport soccer , fans were hard hit by @entity23 's late eqauliser and the fans are embracing the success			1
over seven years on from when @entity107 's move to @entity108 heralded a new era - that did n't quite work out - for soccer in the world 's third largest country by population , football , as it is increasingly being referred to , is finally capturing the imagination of the fans			0
even the absence of @entity121 - considered a national hero in soccer terms - has not dampened the enthusiasm			0
@entity15 's fan park - laid on for the @entity23 game - has a 15,000 person capacity but had to turn fans away , such was its popularity			0
videos of fans celebrating @entity97 ' last - gasp winner against @entity24 have been doing the rounds on @entity133 and are on a par with videos of @entity137 fans reacting to goals - although they have had less to cheer about this year			0
big story : soccer is now front page news in the states - including their 1 - 1 win over @entity144 in 2010 no country aside from the host nation took up more tickets than the @entity2 's 196,838 for the finals while viewing figures are at an all - time high and beginning to even rival those of @entity2 's traditional sports			1
while the @entity152 still does not quite have the same level of popularity at the @entity50 - it is improving			2
this year 's television viewing figures were low but next year @entity107 will launch his own new @entity157 - based @entity152 side , while @entity158 represents arguably the @entity2 ' biggest coup following his sign for @entity163 's sister club @entity161			2
@entity88 legend @entity164 might follow the @entity166 striker			0
coach @entity167 has penned a letter for fans to print out and hand in at work to help them get the day off for what he calls ' for an important cause '			0
for supporters in the @entity2 , real football is finally becoming important			0
adopted nation : @entity11 's print - out letter designed to be handed in by @entity2 's at their workplaces top man : @entity182 , the @entity50 's captain is becoming a popular figure in the @entity2 madness : fans in @entity2 gear react to a goal in a @entity189 fanzone - thousands have travelled over @entity2 fans erupted in fan parks and bars when @entity97 scored the winner against @entity24 but despaired when @entity25 set up @entity194 to equalise for @entity23 and deny them qualification after two games			1
a win or draw against @entity8 would guarantee a place in the next round and might see even more emotional scenes .			0

@entity2 supporters pack out fan parks to cheer on team during 1 - 0 defeat to @entity8
@entity50 progress after finishing above @entity23 on goal *difference*
soccer support at an all - time high , 20 years after @entity2 ' 94
@entity152 still struggling but big names are improving the national *league*
