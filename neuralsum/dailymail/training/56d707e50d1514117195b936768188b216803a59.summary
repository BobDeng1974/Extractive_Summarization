visiting @entity0 in his grotto either at a shopping mall or department store is an annual holiday tradition			2
children and their families stand alongside @entity7 for a photo after telling him what gifts they are hoping to see under the tree			1
but those looking to get their festivities off to more of a bang this year can head to a @entity16 gun range - where patrons can pose alongside @entity0 while holding a firearm of their choice			1
wish for weapons : @entity21 in @entity16 is inviting families along to hold a firearm of their choice during a photo shoot with @entity0 @entity21 and @entity25 has invited families to have their photo taken with @entity0 on sunday			1
those in the frame will stand next to the festive figure and will be able to choose from a number of weapons - a pistol , an @entity33 and an @entity34 ( an assault rifle used by the @entity36 )			1
co-owner @entity37 told @entity38 that safety is their first priority			2
' we ’re not trying to treat guns like toys			2
it ’s not trying to send a message			0
it ’s just about having a good time , getting into the holiday spirit and giving back to the community			0
' our customers and the people who support us will love to do something different for the holidays			0
' only those over 18 will be allowed to hold the guns - which will be unarmed - in the photos			0
children under the age of 12 will not be allowed into the range itself			0
in 2011 , a gun club in @entity62 , @entity63 , did a similar thing			0
toting the gun , and perhaps belts of ammunition around their necks , children smiled alongside a rather bewildered - looking @entity0			2

aim : co-owner @entity37 has said the idea of the controversial campaign is to give something back to the community but insisted they were not treating guns like toys past festivities : in 2011 , a gun club in @entity62 , @entity63 , did a similar thing			0
a baby was seen holding the end of an assault rifle in this bizarre family pose say freeze ! a father wearing the same color shirt as his son stands proudly behind him as he holds a machine gun aloft			1
