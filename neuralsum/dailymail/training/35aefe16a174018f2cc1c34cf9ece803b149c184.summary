by @entity0 published : 20:45 est , 11 july 2012 updated : 09:27 est , 12 july 2012 it is a video which demonstrates the true horror and unpredictability of war			2
a convoy of @entity7 army tanks are captured being attacked by rebel fighters as they travel close to the @entity10 - @entity7 border			1
two appear to hit anti-tank mines , with one also targeted by what seems to be a powerful projectile			0
although there has been no official confirmation , the tanks are thought to be @entity7 army vehicles , loyal to president @entity40			1
the video , which was uploaded on @entity18 , shows the convoy travelling along a main road close to the town of @entity32			0
a @entity7 army tank turns into a dusty track off the main road but hits what appears to be a powerful anti-tank mine			1
a powerful explosion can be seen erupting underneath the vehicle , creating huge amounts of smoke.the entire incident was filmed and posted on @entity18			0
as the smoke disappears , the tank remains motionless and no members of the crew surface from the vehicle , so they are all feared dead			0
another tank in the convoy can be seen travelling towards it , no doubt to mount a rescue effort			0
but this is also soon targeted - it is unclear whether it hits a mine or is hit by a projectile			0
the explosion does n't appear to have caused any fatalities , as the vehicle continues to reverse			0
help : the tank involved in the blast does n't move , leading to fears that all crew members were killed			0
another tank moves close to it , no doubt to mount a rescue effort hit : the second tank is also targeted by what appears to be a projectile problems : it initially appears those inside the tank are not badly injured , as it begins to reverse following the attack horrific : but it is then hit by a second blast , creating a huge fireball however , it is then targeted by what seems to be a projectile which causes an enormous explosion			0
the chaos in @entity7 continued yesterday when the country 's ambassador to @entity96 defected in protest over president @entity40 's violent suppression following the 16 - month uprising			1
@entity102 al - fares said in a video statement posted on @entity104 : ' i declare that i have joined , from this moment , the ranks of the revolution of the @entity7 people , ' he did not elaborate or say from where he had posted the statement			1
' i ask ... the members of the military to join the revolution and to defend the country and the citizens			0
turn your guns toward the criminals from this regime , ' fares said			0
' every @entity7 man has to join the revolution to remove this nightmare and this gang which has reeked corruption across @entity7 and destroyed the state and society over the last 40 years , and to guarantee a bright future for the coming generations			1
' fares , who has close ties to @entity7 security , was the first senior diplomat to quit the embattled government			2
under pressure : although there has been no official confirmation , the tanks are thought to be @entity7 army vehicles , loyal to president @entity40 he did not spell out his reasons for defecting , but repeatedly said government forces have been killing civilians			1
there has been no comment from @entity146 or @entity147 and the @entity148 said it was unable to confirm the defection , hailed by @entity40 's opponents as a sign of crumbling support			1
@entity40 's chief backer on the @entity155 , @entity156 , remained firmly in the @entity7 leader 's camp			1
and the 15 - member council made little headway after international mediator @entity161 asked it to agree on ' clear consequences ' if the government or opposition fail to comply with his faltering plan for a political solution to the crisis			2
fares , a @entity169 and who had held senior positions under the late president @entity172 , is from @entity173 , the eastern city on the road to @entity96 which has been the scene of a ferocious military onslaught by @entity40 's forces			1
' this is just the beginning of a series of defections on the diplomatic level			0
we are in touch with several ambassadors , ' said @entity184 , a member of the main opposition umbrella group , the @entity185			0
the defection of fares could be a major blow to @entity40 , who wants to convince a sceptical world he is conducting a legitimate defence of his country against foreign - backed armed groups bent on toppling the government			2
the apparent crack in @entity40 's diplomatic ranks came as international diplomacy inched along , plagued by divisions over what the next steps should be to address @entity7 's crisis			1
@entity161 , appointed mediator by the @entity202 and the @entity203 , briefed the @entity155 by video link from @entity205 on the results of this week 's diplomatic shuttle to @entity146 , @entity208 and @entity147 - three capitals forming a @entity211 axis of power in the @entity213			2
gone : the chaos in @entity7 continued yesterday when the country 's ambassador to @entity96 , @entity102 al - fares , defected in protest over president @entity40 's violent suppression the deeply divided council must decide the future of a @entity202 observer mission in @entity7 , known as @entity224 , before july 20 when its 90 - day mandate expires			1
it initially approved 300 unarmed military observers to monitor an april 12 ceasefire , which failed to take hold , as part of @entity161 's peace plan			0
' he ( @entity161 ) called for the @entity155 members to put aside their national interests and to put joint and sustained pressure on both parties with clear consequences for non-compliance , ' @entity233 's @entity202 ambassador @entity232 said			2
@entity156 and @entity241 , both veto - wielding permanent council members , have for months blocked moves by western and @entity244 countries aimed at increasing the pressure on @entity40 , leaving the council deadlocked			2
anger : demonstrators protest against president @entity40 in @entity250 district of @entity146 recently @entity251 : smoke rises from @entity253 in @entity254 earlier this week following an attack			1
