journalist @entity0 was in the press box at the @entity2 in @entity3 on tuesday and witnessed the chaotic scenes which led to the abandonment of the @entity7 qualifier between @entity8 and @entity9			1
perhaps i should have known better , but as @entity8 vs @entity9 neared half - time i had started thinking to myself that the evening had , after all , gone off in relative calm			1
sure , you could not hear a single note of the @entity15 national anthem above the whistles and howls ; sure , you did n’t need too big a @entity8 vocabulary to know that the chants from the ultras just below @entity2 ’s press box were about as colourful as it gets			1
but , a couple of chances for the visiting side apart , @entity8 had controlled the first half and – with no away fans in the stadium – there seemed little scope for trouble unless the visitors took a shock lead			2
the flag is flown above the pitch by a drone with the message ' autochthonous ' , meaning indigenous @entity38 leaps to grab the flag and pull it and the drone to the ground - leading to chaos @entity38 tugs at the strings holding the now - grounded flag to the drone flying above @entity46 holds the flag while @entity9 's @entity48 and @entity49 try to protect it tension boiled over as fans and officials spilled onto the pitch after the flag was pulled down the drone struggles to fly as players from both sides get involved in a scuffle @entity61 's @entity60 is at the centre of a scuffle along with @entity65 's @entity64 fans and players clashed on the pitch as tensions reached fever pitch in @entity3 players and officials scuffle after the flag is pulled down - the match has since been abandoned the players brawl while a chair is launched towards them by another pitch invader @entity15 players try to take cover as they flee to the tunnel - a chair can be seen being thrown above them the @entity15 players pile into the tunnel with one of the electronic advertising hoardings knocked over the @entity15 flag - with the map of @entity87 accompanying it - was flown over the field in @entity3 a remote - controller drone was used to show off the flag , before being pulled down by @entity38 @entity8 riot police try to contain the home supporters after fighting broke out in the pitch and the stands - it is not known whether the fans shown in this picture were involved in the disorder @entity101 defender @entity100 walks from the pitch with his head bowed on a disgraceful night @entity15 fans were banned from attending the match between the two @entity107 rival nations , due to the turbulent relations between the two			1
these have mainly surrounded the over the former ethnic @entity15 - dominated @entity8 province of @entity87			1
@entity87 declared independence in 2008 , but this is not recognised by @entity8			2
@entity112 waged a 78 - day air war in 1999 to halt the killing and expulsion of ethnic @entity116 in @entity87 by @entity8 forces fighting a two - year counter-insurgency war			2
seven of @entity9 's squad were born in the @entity87 region			1
this was a game that had set the alarm bells ringing from the off , though			0
@entity8 and @entity9 have a fraught and uneasy recent history , centring around @entity87 – the largely ethnic @entity15 - populated territory that declared independence from @entity8 in 2008			1
@entity129 had stepped in to settle a dispute between the two fas about away ticketing , advising that nobody should travel , and the scope for flashpoints seemed thin on the ground			2
unless somebody came up with something unexpected , surreal and quite remarkable			0
just as i began musing on the unremarkable nature of it all , thinking to tweet my impressions at the break play was stopped by @entity144 – the @entity146 referee may never have another night like this – because a flare had been thrown in the direction of an @entity15 throw - in taker			1
it was cleared from the pitch quickly enough ; the delay , though , took longer than usual and it was only upon a glance upwards that the reason became apparent			0
a small craft was hovering just above the pitch , visible against the floodlights on a dark , clear night and parallel to the top of the stand			0
strange enough , but what was gradually bringing the crowd to fever pitch as it came to their attention proved to be the spark inside the tinderbox			0
the red and black flag , the familiar figure of an eagle in the centre , depicted ‘ @entity9 ’ – an idea encompassing the area of the @entity107 in which ethnic @entity116 reside			1
riot police attempt to contain fans in the stands of the @entity2 a flare is lit among the @entity8 crowd - it is not known whether fans shown in this picture were involved in the disorder @entity101 defender @entity100 watches on as the @entity15 players seize the flag riot police and fans clash in the stands before the game was later cancelled - it is not known whether the fans shown in this picture were involved in the disorder the double - headed eagle , as featured on the @entity15 flag , is imposed upon so - called ' @entity9 ' where ethnic @entity116 live			1
the word ' @entity196 ' refers to @entity8 's alleged attempts to control @entity87 despite not being indigenous to the region			1
the man on the left is @entity201 , founder of the @entity15 national movement , and of the modern @entity15 state as its first head of state and government			2
on the right is @entity207 , a nationalist figure who fought in the @entity208 in @entity87 in 1910 and later in @entity209 against @entity8			2
all the same , when @entity8 defender @entity38 leapt up to catch the flag , which had sunk from the sky as the seemingly remote - controlled drone dropped with it , it seemed a sensible enough thing to do			1
take it to the sidelines , get it off the pitch , get on with the game			0
it had been a surreal , almost filmlike sequence and an act of stunning provocation – but there was time to salvage matters			0
but @entity9 ’s players wanted their flag and , after @entity49 and @entity227 had wrestled @entity38 for it , it ended up in the hands of striker @entity48 – well known for scoring a superb winner against @entity233 last month			1
what followed was a blur , a rush and swirl of people and movements that i was only able to piece together correctly upon returning from the stadium			0
at the time , it was impossible to believe your eyes : in years of covering football at home and abroad , nothing had come close to this			0
as @entity48 made to leave the field , substitutes and officials from both sides had entered the fray – joined , somehow , by fans who had found it surprisingly easy to burst the massed ranks of police			0
one supporter made for @entity259 with a chair ; he was wrestled to the ground by @entity262 , the @entity15 captain and @entity264 player , who detained him there for a almost a minute while chaos unfolded around him			2
another , entering the pitch from the other side , made for visiting players too			2
this unholy mix of players , staff , police and fans piled in – and for a moment you had no idea where it would end			0
it did come to a close , eventually , when the @entity15 players made a run for the players ’ tunnel in the south - east corner			1
this was always going to be the lesser of several evils , but it did n’t stop the being pelted with missiles from the @entity8 ultras – stationed in that very corner , right below my seat in the press box , and set upon by another pitch invader			1
@entity8 fans burn a @entity112 flag during the group i qualifying game at the @entity2 - it is not known whether the fans shown in this picture were involved in the disorder the flag flies above the pitch with the score at 0 - 0 just before half time in @entity3 the flag that was flown over the stadium is shown ahead of the game one supporter tries to protect himself from the riot police who moved into the stand as tensions boiled over fans clashed with police as havoc took hold in the stands in @entity3 - it is not known whether the fans shown in this picture were involved in the disorder as they crouched and ran , hands over their faces , a @entity8 official could be seen covering his own in evident despair a little behind them			1
his countrymen left the field in orderly fashion shortly afterwards , but the damage – and @entity8 has some previous – may have been done despite the obvious act of provocation			2
it came , 15 minutes or so later , that the match would continue			0
by now , the ranks of police separating stands from pitch were three or four deep ; a presence whose like i have never witnessed at any sporting event			0
out came @entity8 manager @entity345 and a few of his substitutes a little after that ; in they came again shortly afterwards			2
the south stand had been partly cleared by then , and something appeared to be up			0
sure enough , news filtered through that @entity144 had abandoned the match			1
@entity8 emerged from the tunnel anyway , moving to the centre circle and applauding the fans who remained			0
but there was little to applaud in @entity3 on tuesday night			0
an event that had been given every opportunity to pass peacefully had ended in turmoil whose repercussions may be felt beyond football			0
few supporters remained outside an eerily quiet ground when i finally left an hour later			0
all was calm again but , just as had been the case before @entity144 stopped play , that told none of the story			0
the match was already hotly - contested before the flag incident saw the match postponed @entity101 's @entity373 was starring in midfield for the @entity8 side before the game was suspended @entity373 sidesteps a challenge from @entity378 before the shameful scenes in the ground @entity8 supporters wave their flags on what was a heated night in @entity3 @entity385 cheer and light flares as they watch the match on giant public screen in @entity87 @entity8 supporters head towards the stadium ahead of the game with what appears to be a flare @entity8 supporters chant , accompanied by their national flag , before the @entity395 - it is not known whether the fans shown in this picture were involved in the disorder			1

tuesday 's @entity7 qualifier between @entity8 and @entity9 was abandoned
a drone carrying the @entity15 flag was flown in above the pitch
@entity8 's @entity38 pulled the flag down and was confronted
@entity146 referee @entity144 led the players off @entity2 pitch
match was later abandoned and @entity129 will now *investigate* the incident
