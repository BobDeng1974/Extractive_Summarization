it 's almost eight months to the day since @entity2 and @entity3 last met and , like bickering siblings , the disagreements go on			1
@entity2 won 4 - 0 at @entity5 in january , which really should have ended all arguments before they began			1
this is @entity8 , though , and different rules apply			0
as such , @entity3 ’s @entity10 has never accepted that result as a hiding while @entity13 of @entity2 also believes the scoreline was n’t representative of what went on			1
@entity2 manager @entity13 will urge his players to get on the front foot in the @entity8 derby @entity10 will not sacrifice his attacking principles against the @entity21 despite his side leaking goals @entity2 have lost their last two matches in the @entity25 and sit in 11th position after a poor start @entity3 have won only once in the @entity25 this season and are just a point above the drop zone ‘ they were fortunate not to go away from the game losing seven or eight , ’ said @entity13 rather pithily this week			1
222 : in 222 derbies , @entity2 have won 89 , @entity3 66 , with 67 draws			1
11 : the highest - scoring match came in 1933 , when @entity2 won 7 - 4 at @entity5			1
13 : the number of own goals in this fixture - three by @entity2 and 10 by @entity3			1
566 : the number of @entity8 derby goals - @entity2 with 311 and @entity3 255			1
on the one hand it ’s good to know these things still matter that much			0
it will be a sad day if they ever do n’t			0
on the other hand , however , both clubs go into saturday ’s lunchtime fixture with broader things to ponder , namely rather indifferent starts to the @entity25 season and defensive records more suited to life at the bottom end of the table			1
it could be argued that the only club from last season ’s top end with anything like satisfactory form so far is @entity61			0
from that point of view , @entity2 and @entity3 are not alone			1
@entity63 scored in @entity2 's 4 - 0 mauling of @entity3 when the sides last met , eight months ago @entity66 also scored that night , and he is in line to make his return from injury against the @entity3 as well as winning more of the derbies , @entity2 have spent a great deal more than @entity3 in recent years nevertheless , it is odd to see both teams in the wrong half of the table with just three league wins between them			1
@entity3 have conceded 15 goals in five league games			1
the last time this happened was 20 years ago and manager @entity82 was not offered the opportunity to stick around and redress the balance			0
@entity2 conceded three at @entity85 , three at @entity86 and have also thrown in a home defeat by @entity88			2
@entity10 , at least , was prepared to admit this week that such risks come as a side - effect of the way he sets teams up to play			2
‘ i ’m not going to hide anything , ’ said the @entity3 manager			2
‘ i know there are managers who are from a school of wanting to win through keeping a clean sheet and having a team that ’s difficult to beat with their main goalscoring threat coming from set - pieces			2
@entity21 defenders @entity108 ( left ) , @entity104 ( centre ) and @entity106 have looked shaky this season @entity109 believes @entity13 needs to rotate his squad better and @entity3 must focus on their defending ‘ i say this with respect , but i ’m from a philosophy of always wanting to win through scoring goals and if that ’s going to leave you open , you need to score more goals than the opposition			1
‘ that ’s the top and bottom of it			0
that ’s the only way you can be good enough to win titles and achieve more than people would expect from your team			0
‘ i feel as hurt losing 1 - 0 as losing 6 - 0 but , if you lose 6 - 3 trying and having a positive from the performance that helps you to take something into the next game , i ’ll accept that			0
’ contrary to what @entity10 believes , it is possible to win titles on the back of clean sheets			2
meanwhile , losing 6 - 3 — as @entity3 did at home to @entity61 in august — will get you nowhere apart from the opening slot on @entity139			0
with @entity3 's defence leaking goals , @entity140 will need to perform if @entity10 's side are to get a result the @entity146 ’s approach is clear , though , and we should not begrudge him that			1
as for @entity13 , he refuses to accept that his own style of play is of the risk - and - reward type , even though @entity2 finished second last season while conceding more goals ( 50 ) than @entity153 , who finished 11th , and at least as many away ( 32 ) as all of the top 17 teams apart from @entity157 and @entity158			1
this would appear to point to a problem , one perhaps exacerbated so far this season by an uncertain early contribution from summer signing @entity104			0
@entity3 last celebrated a win at @entity5 on september 27 , 1999 - 15 years ago			1
@entity165 scored the only goal as red cards were shown to @entity3 ’s @entity168 and @entity2 ’s @entity169 and @entity63			2
@entity165 said : ‘ the thing which surprised me was seeing so many @entity171 celebrating in the @entity172 ! ’ @entity63 recalled			0
‘ i had a gut - wrenching pain in my stomach after that			0
’ ‘ it is probably an easy assumption to make when coaches set up to play an attacking game , ’ said @entity13			0
‘ the way we set up , it is about having the balance			0
we look to impose our style on the game , but you always have to respect your opponent			0
’ all managers defend their teams and their tactics and @entity13 is no different			2
looking at the two teams objectively , perhaps @entity10 has more to worry about			2
his defence is pretty much the same as last year			0
@entity13 , at least , can point to the problems with bedding new players in			0
whatever the case , at @entity5 on saturday the wider arguments do n’t matter , only the result			2
given the way football often works , this one will probably end up goalless			0
@entity165 wheels away in delight after scoring the winner in 1999 when @entity3 last won at @entity5 @entity63 was one of three players sent off in the match where tempers reached boiling point @entity3 striker @entity168 and @entity2 goalkeeper @entity169 were also sent off in 1999			1

@entity2 and @entity3 have both *struggled* defensively this season
the @entity21 have let in eight goals in five @entity25 games and are 11th
the @entity3 have conceded 13 times and are 14th
the two sides face each other at @entity5 on saturday
@entity13 and @entity10 have both defended their styles
the managers say their teams will go for the win
