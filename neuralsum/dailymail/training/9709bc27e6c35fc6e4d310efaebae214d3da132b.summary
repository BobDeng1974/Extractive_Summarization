the @entity0 has rejected a resolution to the @entity2 for an @entity4 withdrawal from occupied areas and the establishment of a @entity8 state by late 2017			1
the resolution had been put forward by @entity10 and was rebuffed by the council on tuesday after it failed to receive the minimum nine votes			1
the draft called for negotiations to be based on territorial lines that existed before @entity4 captured the @entity16 , @entity17 and the @entity18 in the 1967 @entity20 war			1
it also called for a peace deal within 12 months			0
the @entity40 is one of the five veto - wielding permanent members			0
there were eight votes in favor , including @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 , two against and five abstentions , among them @entity50			0
@entity51 joined the @entity40 in voting against the measure			0
@entity40 ambassador to the @entity55 @entity54 defended @entity39 's position against the draft in a speech to the 15 - nation council by saying it was not a vote against peace between @entity4 and the @entity8			1
' the @entity40 every day searches for new ways to take constructive steps to support the parties in making progress toward achieving a negotiated settlement , ' she said			0
' the @entity0 resolution put before us today is not one of those constructive steps			1
' the @entity0 rejected the resolution brought by @entity10 , which called for establishment of a @entity8 state by late 2017 and @entity4 withdrawal from occupied @entity16 and @entity17 critique : @entity54 , the @entity40 ' ambassador to the @entity55 said the resolution was not a constructive step towards peace she said the text was ' deeply imbalanced ' and contained ' unconstructive deadlines that take no account of @entity4 's legitimate security concerns			1
' to make matters worse , @entity54 said , it ' was put to a vote without a discussion or due consideration among council members			0
' she did not spare @entity4 either			2
' today 's vote should not be interpreted as a victory for an unsustainable status quo , ' @entity54 said , adding that @entity39 would oppose actions by either side that undermined peace efforts , whether ' in the form of settlement activity or imbalanced draft resolutions			0
' @entity100 ambassador @entity99 , the sole @entity101 representative on the council , expressed regret that the resolution was voted down , while noting that she thought council members should have had more time to discuss the proposal			2
the defeat of the resolution was not surprising			0
@entity39 , council diplomats said , had made clear it did not want such a resolution put to a vote before @entity4 's election in march			1
the @entity8 , the diplomats said , insisted on putting the resolution to a vote despite the fact that it was clear @entity39 would not let it pass			1
their sudden announcement last weekend that @entity118 wanted a vote before the new year surprised @entity121 delegations on the council			0
in order to pass , a resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes from the council 's five permanent members			2
the @entity131 and @entity132 camps were split in the vote			0
@entity45 and @entity134 voted in favor of the resolution while @entity50 and @entity137 abstained			0
among the @entity132 , @entity138 voted yes while @entity140 and @entity141 abstained			0
the @entity8 , frustrated by the lack of progress in peace talks , have sought to internationalize the issue by seeking @entity55 membership and recognition of statehood via membership in international organizations			2
@entity8 observer @entity151 thanked delegations that voted for the resolution , noting that lawmakers in a number of @entity131 countries have called for recognition of @entity10			1
he said it was time to end the ' abhorrent @entity4 occupation and impunity that has brought our people so much suffering			2
' tension : @entity4 security forces use tear gas during a protest against a @entity168 settlement construction at @entity169 , in @entity118 , @entity16 on @entity170 ' it is thus most regrettable that the @entity0 remains paralyzed , ' he said			1
@entity151 added that the @entity8 leadership ' must now consider its next steps			2
' the @entity8 have threatened to join the @entity175 , which they could then use as a forum to push for war crimes proceedings against @entity4			1
in a brief statement , @entity4 delegate @entity178 said the @entity8 have found every possible opportunity to avoid direct negotiations and brought the council ' a preposterous unilateral proposal			1
' ' i have news for the @entity8 - you can not agitate and provoke your way to a state , ' he said			2
@entity45 ambassador @entity191 said @entity192 would continue its efforts to get a resolution through the council that would help move peace efforts forward			2
' @entity45 regrets that it is n't possible to reach a consensus today , ' he said , noting that he voted for the resolution despite having reservations about its contents			0
' our efforts must not stop here			0
it is our responsibility to try again			0
' an earlier @entity8 draft called for @entity17 to be the shared capital of @entity4 and a @entity8 state			1
the draft that was voted on reverted to a harder line , saying only that @entity17 would be @entity10 's capital and calling for an end to @entity4 settlement building			1
the @entity4 government had said that a @entity0 vote , following the collapse in april of @entity40 - brokered talks on @entity8 statehood , would only deepen the conflict			1
@entity4 , which pulled troops and settlers out of the @entity18 in 2005 , has said its eastern border would be indefensible if it withdrew completely from the @entity16			1
