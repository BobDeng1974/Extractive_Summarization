by @entity0 published : 10:32 est , 5 february 2013 updated : 12:24 est , 5 february 2013 @entity1 are on track to take on @entity3 after enjoying a relaxing train journey to @entity5 today			1
@entity7 ’s side , who face next year 's @entity9 hosts at a sold - out @entity10 tomorrow , travelled by coach to @entity13 rail station before boarding a @entity15 service to the capital			1
the @entity1 squad and their army of support staff were , obviously , accommodated in first class , in carriages specially partitioned off from the public			1
platform to success : the @entity1 squad wait for their train to @entity5 from @entity13 station managing the journey : @entity7 ( left ) waits for the train with his players and staff , while @entity32 ( clutching his pillow ! ) and @entity35 chat once they had arrived in @entity5 , @entity7 confirmed that @entity37 will start the match in order to win his 100th cap			1
the @entity42 left - back will become only the seventh player to reach a century of caps for the @entity1			2
asked if @entity37 would start , @entity7 told reporters : ' yes he will			1
he 'll start the game , then i 'll have to see what to do with @entity49 ( @entity50 ) , who has been doing very well			2
' centre of attention : @entity37 , speaking to @entity53 duo @entity32 and @entity54 , will claim his 100th cap against @entity3 tomorrow @entity7 did , however , rule out the possibility of @entity37 leading the side out at @entity10 tomorrow in place of captain @entity59 , who made his 100th appearance for @entity1 in last november 's friendly with @entity61			1
@entity7 said : ' i do n't see any reason why the captain should let anyone else lead the team out			2
' @entity37 does his talking and work on the field and i do n't think he 's ever pushed himself forward during his 100 appearances as a potential captain of the team			2
' i think he 's just very happy to be a key player in the team so i 'm pretty certain he wo n't be trying to rip the armband off @entity76 tomorrow			0
' @entity59 agreed that @entity37 should now be considered an all - time great			2
' i think he deserves to be in there , ' he told @entity78			0
' i look at the players i played with throughout my career and i think he 's been one of the most consistent			0
' tributes : @entity59 and @entity7 lavished praised on @entity37 ahead of his 100th cap waiting game : the @entity1 players chat as they wait for their @entity15 to take them to the capital what you been listening to then , lad ? @entity50 and @entity89 may have discussed the latest indie tunes - but we 're not sure about @entity93 's choice ( left ) on the platform , @entity53 ’s 19 - year - old forward @entity32 carried a pillow – not because he was expecting to be bored by team - mate @entity35 ’s conversation but because footballers carry their own pillows to minimise the risk of infection			1
it ’s those small margins that make a difference at elite level			0
the squad , who normally stay at the @entity108 outside @entity109 , were heading for their central @entity5 hotel , the @entity111 on @entity112 , with the delights of @entity114 around the corner			1
@entity1 will take a matchday stroll in the @entity118 neighbourhood tomorrow , as exclusively revealed in @entity121 ’s @entity120 column last week , although a walk down one of the world 's best - known shopping thoroughfares might be a step too far in embracing city living - as they want to do at @entity3 2014 with a base in @entity129			1
sir @entity130 will welcome the squad at @entity10 as the former @entity133 star will be part of the ceremony before the game , which falls on the 55th anniversary of the @entity139 air disaster			0
there will be a moment of silence before kick - off in memory of those who died in @entity139 and to remember those killed last month in the @entity148 nightclub tragedy			0
hanging around : the @entity1 players wait for their train in the first class lounge at @entity13 station classy bunch : @entity153 ( left ) follows his team - mates aboard on the train to @entity5 and they 're off ... @entity1 's players head down the stairs to the train , while @entity7 ( right ) steps on to the carriage @entity161 had agreed to attend as guest of honour at what is the first friendly of the @entity166 ’s 150th anniversary year but has been forced to pull out due to a recent hip operation			1
the @entity148 legend originally hoped to be over the effects of the surgery but has been advised against travelling			0
the referee for tomorrow ’s match will be @entity173 , who took charge of @entity42 ’s @entity176 triumph over @entity177 last season			0
he also refereed the @entity180 final			0
all aboard : @entity153 chats to @entity182 duo @entity181 and @entity50			0

@entity1 players and coaching staff travel from @entity13 to @entity5 as they prepare for *showdown* with @entity3
manager @entity7 confirms @entity37 will start and win 100th cap
@entity190 will stay in central @entity5 hotel and take a stroll around @entity118 tomorrow
