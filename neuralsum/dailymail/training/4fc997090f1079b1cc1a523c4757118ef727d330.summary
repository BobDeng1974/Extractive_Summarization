former @entity1 number one @entity0 wants to rediscover the formula which saw him create history last year by successfully defending a tournament for the first time in his career			1
@entity0 's last victory of a phenomenal 2013 came in the @entity9 and ensured he became the first man to win the @entity11 on the @entity12 and the @entity13 to @entity14 in the same year			1
unsurprisingly the 38 - year - old has been unable to reproduce such success this season , although he returns to @entity18 in @entity14 in second place on the money list behind world number one @entity22 , whose four wins - including two majors - helped him wrap up the race to @entity14 title with a week to spare			1
@entity0 won the @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 to @entity14 in 2013 ' last year was very special and i know it ca n't be as special this year because @entity22 has already won the overall race , ' said @entity0 , who was 25 under par in beating @entity31 by six shots here 12 months ago			1
' but i can make it a very special week for myself by playing well here and hopefully give myself a chance to win			2
i have n't defended a title as of yet , so i could n't think of a much better place to do it than here this week			0
' i 'm pretty pleased with the overall performance this year			2
it was always going to be a tough one and , especially early in the season , it was tough			0
i was battling a bit of fatigue and when you 're tired you do n't have the energy to practise and get going with the game and then it just becomes a bit of a bad cycle			0
unsurprisingly , the 38 - year - old @entity52 has struggled to replicate the same remarkable form in 2014 ' from late spring onwards it 's been quite all right and i contended in a few events and had a couple of strong results			1
overall it 's not a bad season by any means			0
i think i got close to 200 world ranking points on the board , which is always a good indicator for a strong season			0
it 's a win that 's missing and hopefully i can take the opportunity here			0
' @entity0 was third in the @entity67 on sunday , his 26th event of a season which will end with the @entity70 - hosted by @entity71 - from december 4 - 7			1
' i 'm excited about next year 's schedule , ' added the world number four , who won three points from four matches in @entity1 's @entity78 victory at @entity79 in september			1
' i kind of had a great formula from 2012 and into 2013 , and then i felt like i slipped out of that one a little bit due to a lot of different reasons			2
' i 'm excited about trying to get back into that , because it was a pretty good recipe i had			0
i want to get back to doing all the little bits and pieces right and focus on all those processes , rather than trying to find your game and work on your game when you 're out here			0
i 'll do that away from the tournaments			2
when i 'm out here , i 'm here to be fresh and be ready to compete			0
' i played 31 tournaments in 2013 , 28 this year and would like to get down to 26			2
' @entity0 also revealed that he would like to reduce the number of tournaments he plays in each year			1

@entity0 won the @entity11 , @entity12 and race to @entity14 in 2013
unsurprisingly , @entity0 has struggled to replicate the form in 2014
the 38 - year - old @entity52 also said he wants to reduce the number of tournaments he plays in each year
