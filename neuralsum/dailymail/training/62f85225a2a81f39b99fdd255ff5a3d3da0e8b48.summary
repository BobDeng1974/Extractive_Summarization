police are investigating claims that a fox was killed in a hunt hosted by @entity5 ’s father - in - law			1
@entity7 protesters clashed with the @entity8 amid claims that eight hounds chased and killed the fox after setting off from the 18th century country estate of @entity13 , in @entity14 , owned by @entity16 ’s father sir @entity15			1
the hunt saboteurs allege that a member of the hunt – the ‘ whipper - in ’ whose job it is to keep the pack of hounds together – tried to take the animal ’s lifeless body away but fled when a protester came across the scene			1
afterwards , the @entity29 , who had been monitoring the hunt on saturday , february 21 , posted gruesome photos of a dead fox dripping with blood on social media			1
police are investigating claims that a fox was killed in a hunt hosted by @entity5 's father - in - law after a graphic photograph of a dead animal was posted online the hunt had met at the home of @entity16 ’s 68 - year - old father , in the village of @entity46 , before setting off on a legal ‘ trail hunt ’			1
last night a spokesman for the hunt claimed the fox had not been killed by its hounds			1
but hunt saboteur @entity52 , 20 , said : ‘ we were following the huntsmen through a woodland , and then the hounds started to cry , which means they were on the scent of a fox			1
' so we did our best to put them off – we used horn calls to try and stop them from chasing the fox			2
we use the same horn that a huntsman would use			0
‘ i then saw a fox bolt along the edge of the woodland so i raced over that way			2
the best way to stop the hounds from following is to get in between them and the fox			2
once i got to the fence where i saw the fox run past , i saw about eight to ten of the hounds in a semi-circle and a whipper - in			1
‘ she was in the semi-circle with the hounds			2
i could n’t see what she was doing but i believe she was trying to pick up the fox and take it away so we could n’t see it			2
‘ the whipper - in then took the hounds away as soon as i got there , leaving the fox			1
‘ after that , none of the huntsman would talk to us			0
they went quiet and just carried on – moved off with the hounds to the next woodlands			0
sir @entity15 ( left ) owns @entity13 from which the @entity8 & @entity7 ( right ) took off ‘ i could see the fox ’s intestines			1
the hounds had opened up its stomach			0
i believe it was still alive when the hounds left and i came to it			0
when i carried it back to our van i could still hear short breaths from its mouth			0
we then gave it to the police for evidence			0
’ in 2004 , @entity115 ’s @entity114 government banned the hunting of wild mammals with dogs			0
instead , hunts now follow the trail of a scent			0
a spokesman for the hunt said : ‘ the @entity8 were involved in legal trail hunting and were afterwards asked by police whether a fox had been killed by hounds			1
the answer to that was no. it ’s not unusual for hunt saboteurs , who ’ve been harassing the legal activity on regular occasions , to make up such stories			0
from looking at the photos of the animal there was no indication of how it was killed			0
’ a spokesman for @entity142 said : ‘ we are aware of reports a fox was hunted illegally in the @entity146 - on - the - @entity147 area			2
we take any allegation of wildlife crime seriously , and our enquiries into this incident are ongoing			0
’ sir @entity15 was not available for comment			1
