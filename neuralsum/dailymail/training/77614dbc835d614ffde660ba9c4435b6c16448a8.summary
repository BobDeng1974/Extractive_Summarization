by @entity0 doctors will be prosecuted for performing sex - selective abortions , the @entity1 will warn today			1
they will be reminded the practice is ‘ unacceptable and illegal ’ , as health secretary @entity5 and the @entity6 closes a ‘ loophole ’ used by prosecutors to avoid bringing charges against doctors who carry out abortions based on the sex of the foetus			1
the guidance is expected to draw a line under the issue , making it clear that doctors who pre-sign abortion forms and carry out abortions based on gender are breaking the law and will be prosecuted			1
health minister @entity5 will today warn doctors that performing gender - selective abortions is ' unacceptable and illegal ' abortion clinics will also be required to recognise that gender - based abortions are illegal as part of their licence conditions			1
the guidance has been re-issued following a @entity32 ruling in september that said it would not be in the ‘ public interest ’ to prosecute doctors who had carried out gender - based abortions			1
sir @entity36 , the then @entity37 , said the law did not ' prohibit gender - specific abortions '			1
it was found that 67 physicians were involved in pre-signing abortion forms without knowing anything about the women involved			0
the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) , the doctors ’ regulator , ruled out action against the doctors			2
that , combined with the @entity32 ruling led to concerns that the practice was effectively legalised			1
the @entity1 last night stressed that abortions based on gender were illegal			1
under the @entity55 , a pregnancy can be terminated legally if two doctors agree the physical or mental health of the child or the woman is in jeopardy under the @entity55 , a pregnancy can be terminated legally if two doctors agree the physical or mental health of the child or the woman is in jeopardy			2

' @entity98 , chief executive of the @entity99 ( @entity99 ) , added : ' one in three women will need an abortion because their contraception fails , their life circumstances suddenly change , or a problem is found with a much wanted pregnancy			0
' recently , doctors providing abortion services have felt under intense political scrutiny , and this document should give them the reassurance that neither the law nor regulations have changed to accommodate those who think their work is wrong			2
' however , abortion remains a criminal offence and this guidance is about meeting the requirements of the law not those of women or doctors			2
the law impedes best practice			0
' there is no clinical need for two doctors to certify a woman ’s reasons for abortion , in addition to obtaining her consent , it simply causes delays			0
