by @entity0 published : 10:17 est , 30 november 2012 updated : 11:23 est , 30 november 2012 a treasure haul salvaged from a sunken @entity3 galleon sunk by @entity5 warships in 1804 was unveiled today			2
the loot was found in the wreck of @entity8 and had been at the centre of a five - year legal battle between a @entity12 salvage company and @entity3			1
@entity12 firm @entity13 found the lost treasure off @entity17 's @entity16 coast in 2007			1
at the time , the treasure was estimated to be worth $ 500m ( £ 316m )			0
treasure haul : a block of encrusted silver coins from the shipwreck of a 1804 galleon , on its first display to the media at a ministry building , in @entity27 discovery : a worker holds up a gold tobacco box from the shipwreck of a 1804 galleon treasure trove : a block of encrusted silver coins - the inventory counted 574,553 silver coins and 212 gold coins but a @entity12 federal judge recently ordered @entity13 to give @entity3 access to the treasure , the last in a series of legal defeats for the salvage firm			1
only a tiny portion of the haul from the galleon that sank off @entity17 's @entity16 coast near the straits of @entity49 was shown to the media - 12 individual silver coins , a block of encrusted silver coins stuck together after centuries underwater , two gold tobacco boxes and a bronze pulley			1
authorities who have been inventorying the treasure since it was flown from @entity57 to @entity3 in february said it will be transferred later this year from @entity27 to the @entity58 of @entity59 in the @entity61 city of @entity62			2
precious : the trove is worth an estimated $ 500 million viewing : displays are expected to start next year , with some items put on rotating temporary displays at museums across the country battle : @entity3 took possession of the treasure after courts rejected arguments that @entity57 - based @entity13 was entitled to all or most of the treasure find : officials said that the weight of the treasure was not the 17 tons reported during the legal fight because that included a ton of sea water used to help preserve many of the silver coins in storage containers displays are expected to start next year , with some items put on rotating temporary displays at museums across the country			1
though previous estimates have put the value of the treasure at $ 500 million , @entity3 officials said they were n't trying to determine an amount because the haul is part of the nation 's cultural heritage and can never be sold under @entity3 law			2
' it 's invaluable , ' said @entity97 , the @entity98 's deputy director of national heritage			0
' how would you put a price on the @entity102 ? " hands on the haul : @entity3 military personnel load a @entity106 with some of the 594,000 coins and artifacts recovered by @entity12 treasure hunters from the ship in 2007 read it and weep : a @entity3 military commander signs a document that recognises that @entity3 assumes the custody of the treasure trove before taking off to @entity3 from the @entity117 air base in @entity118 , @entity57 keeping track : a member of @entity3 's @entity98 documents one of the coins from the sunken @entity8 earlier this year @entity3 took possession of the treasure after courts rejected arguments that @entity57 - based @entity13 was entitled to all or most of the treasure			1
@entity128 said @entity3 authorities are still trying to convince a judge in @entity118 that the @entity12 company should also be forced to pay @entity3 's legal costs			1
officials said friday that the weight of the treasure was not the 17 tons reported during the legal fight because that included a ton of sea water used to help preserve many of the silver coins in storage containers			0
trove : this picture shows hundreds of the silver coins recovered by @entity13 from the seabed off the coast of @entity17 hunting the loot : crew members of the @entity57 - based @entity13 used a remote - controlled submersible to bring the coins to the surface the @entity8 was sunk by @entity5 warships off the coast of @entity17 during the @entity150 in 1804 while sailing back from @entity151 with more than 200 people on board			1
@entity3 was a neutral country at the time , but had been showing signs of declaring war in alliance with @entity157			0
the galleon was ordered to change course towards @entity160 , but its senior @entity3 officer refused and opened fire on the @entity5			0
tales recount that the @entity8 broke ' like an egg , dumping her yolk into the deep ' after the attack most of the survivors were rescued from one or two small boats			0
the @entity170 removed 4,773,153 gold and silver pesos from three captured ships , 1,307,634 of which belonged to the king of @entity3			0
after the incident , @entity3 declared war on @entity160			0
the inventory counted 574,553 silver coins and 212 gold coins			0
@entity13 had argued that the wreck was never positively identified as the @entity8			1
and if it was that vessel , the company contended , then the ship was on a commercial trade trip — not a sovereign mission — at the time it sank , meaning @entity3 would have no firm claim to the cargo			2
@entity190 nternational treaties generally hold that warships sunk in battle are protected from treasure seekers			0
@entity13 lost every round in federal courts as the @entity3 government painted the company as modern - day pirates			1
the company has said in earnings statements that it has spent $ 2.6 million salvaging , transporting , storing and conserving the treasure			0
# the metals were mined and the coins minted in the @entity204 , from places that are now in @entity206 , @entity207 and @entity208			0
how it all started : this painting shows the @entity8 being sunk by the @entity211 as it makes it way back from @entity151 in 1804 @entity3 overcame a last - minute effort by the @entity208 government to block the transfer of the treasure back to @entity3			1
@entity208 did not gain its independence until 1824 , but the country 's lawyers argued it was more than a simple colony at the time because it was the local seat of the @entity3 crown when the ship sank			2
@entity3 's @entity223 promised in a visit to @entity206 several months ago that some of the treasure would be loaned to the country for display in museums .			2
