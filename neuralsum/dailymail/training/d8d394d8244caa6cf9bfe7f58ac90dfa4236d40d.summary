by @entity0 published : 15:10 est , 15 december 2013 updated : 18:36 est , 15 december 2013 the latest scion of one of @entity4 's most powerful political dynasties is trying to convince voters he 's something other than what his famous surname suggests			1
@entity9 , the 37 - year - old grandson of one former president and nephew of another , is launching his political career by running for @entity15 ' little - known but powerful land commissioner post			1
but rather than campaigning on the mainstream @entity16 embodied by the family name , @entity9 says he 's ' a movement conservative ' more in line with the tea party			1
moving right : in his bid to secure @entity22 , rather than campaign on the mainstream @entity16 embodied by the @entity9 family name , @entity9 says he is more in line with the tea party move to the right : in his first campaign , @entity9 is distancing himself from his family as if to underscore the point , he says he draws the most inspiration not from the administrations of his grandfather , @entity33 , or his uncle , @entity34 , but from former house speaker @entity35 , who engineered the 1994 @entity37 takeover of that chamber			1
' on social questions , national defense , economic issues , i 'm a strong conservative , ' @entity9 told @entity0			2
that kind of statement helps make him the latest - and perhaps one of the more unlikely - faces in the parade of @entity37 marching even farther to the right in already fiercely conservative @entity15			1
as he takes baby steps away from the @entity9 legacy , @entity9 could struggle to convince the party 's far right that he 's really more conservative than either of his elders who have occupied the @entity54			1
' a @entity9 ca n't be a true conservative , ' said @entity56 , a @entity15 tea party activist and organizer			1
@entity9 insists that he 's up to the challenge , noting that he was an early supporter of tea party hero sen. @entity60 , who after less than a year in the @entity62 has rocketed from relative political unknown to ruler of the @entity65			1
family values : @entity9 , the grandson of one former president and nephew of another , visits the @entity37 of @entity15 headquarters where he formally filed to run for @entity15 land commissioner , in @entity73 , @entity15 ' that 's something that we bring to the table that 's different , ' @entity9 said			1
' we 're a mainstream conservative that appeals to all @entity37			0
' @entity78 , @entity60 's former campaign spokesman , said the @entity80 ' walk in certain circles , and some of those people might put their nose up at @entity60 sometimes , but @entity9 tries to cross that divide			2
' ' @entity9 recognizes that it 's a blessing and a curse to have that last name , ' @entity78 said			2
' there 's a reason he 's not really being challenged on the ballot			0
but he also realizes there 's a lot of people who will be very skeptical of him			0
' the @entity15 land commissioner administers state - owned lands and mineral resources that help pay for public education statewide			1
the position can be a springboard to higher office			1
the incumbent commissioner , @entity101 , is running for lieutenant governor			0
and the incumbent lieutenant governor he 's challenging , @entity103 , served as land commissioner before winning his current job			1
squaring off against @entity9 are former @entity109 @entity108 mayor @entity107 and @entity37 @entity111 businessman @entity110			0
but @entity9 has raked in more than $ 3.3 million and is expected to cruise to victory both in the @entity37 primary in march and the november general election			0
@entity37 have not lost a statewide race in @entity15 since 1994			0
@entity117 : president @entity33 shakes hands with his son , president @entity34			0
@entity33 was chairman of the @entity120 in the early 1970s but it looks as though @entity9 may take a different path but @entity9 's rightward drift comes with risks			1
it might hurt his image as a next - generation @entity37 who could reach out to @entity15 ' booming @entity129 population			1
@entity9 is a fluent @entity130 speaker whose mother , @entity131 , was born in @entity132			0
@entity129 vote overwhelmingly @entity108 , but @entity9 said many also agree with the @entity65 on social issues , opposing abortion and large government			1
' i 'm willing to stand behind this concept , that as conservatives we can win the @entity129 vote without selling out the values , ' @entity9 said			1
' i do n't think we need to compromise			0
' @entity9 says he wants to embody conservative activism while still leaving room to govern			2
he refused to endorse the @entity60 - led effort to defund the @entity147 's health care overhaul , which sparked a partial government shutdown			0
@entity9 called the measure ' a monstrosity ' but also said the only option left was to look for market - based solutions to reform it			2
' we need to get back to being the party of solutions , ' @entity9 said			2
@entity158 's leadership in 1994 ' was the last great case study where you saw a conservative party that came forward with solutions on the big issues of the day			2
' son of @entity165 : @entity9 is the son of former @entity166 governor @entity165 born in @entity167 , @entity9 grew up in @entity166 , where his father , @entity165 , was governor from 1998 until 2007			2
after college , he taught school in inner - city @entity171 , worked on his uncle 's presidential campaign and earned a law degree from the @entity175			0
he also clerked for a federal judge and founded a capital company in @entity178 , where he now lives			0
in 2010 , he served an eight - month tour in @entity180 with naval intelligence under an assumed name for security reasons			0
those close to the @entity80 shrugged off any suggestion that some family members might be irked to see @entity9 distancing himself from the clan			0
' the only thing the @entity9 family cares about is that @entity9 follow his convictions , whatever they are , ' said @entity191 , a @entity65 strategist and former advisor to @entity34 's presidential campaigns			0
@entity194 , a former spokeswoman and diplomat for the @entity34 @entity147 , said any candidate runs ' based on his or her fundamental values and priorities , and that is true regardless of your last name			0
' family ties : former @entity4 president @entity33 waves during the game between the @entity206 and the @entity207 at @entity208 on december 1 , 2013 in @entity167 , @entity15 others who know the family said @entity158 's ' @entity211 , ' which was on the cutting edge of activist conservatism in 1994 , is now far more mainstream for the @entity65 as a whole - including the @entity80			2
still , @entity215 , president of the @entity216 , a socially conservative activist group , said @entity9 's claiming of the movement conservative mantle is n't credible given the shadow his family has cast over state and national politics for so long			1
however , while many tea party backers remain enraged that @entity9 's uncle ran up enormous federal deficits and oversaw the bank bailout , they are unwilling to turn their back on the family , @entity223 acknowledged			1
' i think @entity207 are very respectful of the gentlemen in politics , the kindness and compassion that the family has earned over a long period of time , ' she said			0
those sentiments will probably extend to @entity9 too , she added , ' even though it should not be that way			0
