by @entity0 published : 15:48 est , 22 november 2012 updated : 16:51 est , 22 november 2012 just when you thought you could n't hear @entity3 's @entity2 one more time a house adorned with more than 25,000 breathtaking led lights may make you see it in a whole new light			1
flashing in perfect timing to the four - minute song , managing to capture both dance moves and pauses for breath , the spectacle of lights outside @entity11 , @entity12 is mesmerizing a growing @entity19 audience worldwide			1
lights sharply thumping across the double - door garage follow the same energetic beat performed by the @entity24 musician before flashes of snowflakes shimmer as well as sway in and out			2
using a center green - lit cactus at times as a mouth piece for its stop and go , the house comes to a dramatic stance with the song , cutting its display to a pitch black before abruptly beginning again			1
owner and designer @entity62 says it 's a similar display to the ones he 's put together the past few years , though it 's an entirely new experience for his current neighbourhood - his family having moved in just two months ago			1
' he barely unpacked and first thing he started with was the lights , ' a mesmerized neighbor told @entity71			0
' how do you compete with that ? ' new neighbours : the homeowners moved into the house just two months ago before setting up the lights , fortunately , they say , to the delight of neighbours price tag : with all of the more than 25,000 lights being leds the homeowner says december 's electricity bill for the display will be a mere $ 15 work of art : homeowner and designer @entity62 said it two him two weekends setting up the display and two to three hours programming the lights to @entity2 as well as some other holiday favourites fortunately for @entity92 storms the lights have been received positively he says , and the music is n't heard blaring from the roadside but can instead be heard from a radio station audience members can tune into from their cars			1
having spent two weekends adorning the house - with hired help for his safety - it took him two to three hours programming the music to @entity2 he said , but did so too to some holiday favourites			0
as for the electricity bill mr @entity62 tells @entity105 the led lights will cost him just $ 15 to run the entire month of december			0
controls : mr @entity108 shows off his small work station that controls the lights , designed using programme @entity111 on his netbook , pictured ' all our lights we have are led so they just sip on electricity , ' he said			0
using his website @entity118 , he shares not only his previous year 's work but a quick how - to tutorial on his accomplishments as well			0
mr @entity62 , a perhaps recognizable fan of movie @entity122 , calls character @entity123 a hero			0
