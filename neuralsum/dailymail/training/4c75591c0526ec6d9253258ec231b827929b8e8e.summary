in the search for life on @entity5 , landers , rovers and spacecraft have been sent to the red planet to ascertain if it was once , or still is , habitable			2
but evidence for such life might now have been found in a meteorite that landed on @entity11 three years ago			1
examining a meteorite named @entity14 , scientists have found small fissures that were filled with carbon containing matter - and it may be of extraterrestrial biological origin			1
it was ejected from @entity5 by an asteroid impact 700,000 years ago			1
pieces of the meteorite were found to have fissures caused by water , and these may contain carbon of biological origin , according to a new study the @entity14 meteorite fell to @entity11 in the @entity21 desert on 18 july 2011			1
it was ejected from @entity5 after an asteroid crashed into the surface 700,000 years ago , sending debris into space - some of which made its way to @entity11			1
and this meteorite , the fall of which was seen by several eyewitnesses , seems to bear signs the red planet was once habitable			0
dr @entity47 , director of @entity49 's @entity11 and @entity50 , and colleagues from @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 performed a detailed analysis of organic carbon found in the meteorite			2
the @entity14 meteorite fell in @entity58 , in the @entity60 region of @entity61 , on 18 july 2011			1
it broke apart in the atmosphere and rained material on to @entity11 , with several pieces being recovered and some being sold			0
it is also only the fifth @entity5 meteorite to be seen falling to @entity11 by eyewitnesses - the last being in 1962			2
@entity14 had been ejected from the surface of @entity5 700,000 years ago when an asteroid struct the surface			1
of most interest is the sign of certain elements being carried into cracks in the rocks by water fluid , which has never been seen in a @entity5 meteorite before			2
they concluded that it very likely had a biological origin			0
the scientists argue that the carbon could have been deposited in fissures of the rock when it was still on @entity5 by fluid that was rich in organic matter			0
' so far , there is no other theory that we find more compelling , ' said dr @entity47			0
other studies of the meteorite have agreed that carbon in the meteorite is organic			0
however , there has been a debate as to where this carbon came from			0
a study in 2012 proposed that the carbon came from the crystallisation of magma at high temperature on @entity5 - ruling out a biological origin			1
but the latest study says liquids seeping into the rock at low temperatures near the surface is a more likely explanation			0
the @entity14 meteorite fell in @entity58 ( shown ) , in the @entity60 region of @entity61 , on 18 july 2011			1
it broke apart in the atmosphere and rained material on to @entity11 , with several pieces being recovered and some being sold			0
and it is only the fifth @entity5 meteorite to be spotted falling to @entity11 dr @entity47 , director of @entity49 's @entity11 and @entity50 , and colleagues from @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 performed a detailed analysis of organic carbon found in the meteorite			2
they found it very likely had a biological origin from @entity5 ( shown ) this is supported by some properties of the meteorite 's carbon			1
most notably , the ratio of the carbon 13 isotope to carbon 12 was similar to coal on @entity11			0
this is important because coal has a biological origin - namely dead plant and animal matter			1
in the study the researchers also ruled out the chance the carbon had come from @entity11 - and they are now increasingly sure this meteorite proves life on @entity5 once existed			1
' insisting on certainty is unwise , particularly on such a sensitive topic , ' warns dr @entity47			0
' i 'm completely open to the possibility that other studies might contradict our findings			0
' however , our conclusions are such that they will rekindle the debate as to the possible existence of biological activity on @entity5 - at least in the past			2

the @entity14 meteorite fell to @entity11 in @entity21 on 18 july 2011
it was ejected from @entity5 by an asteroid impact 700,000 years ago
pieces of the meteorite were found to have fissures caused by water
within these fissures elements were found that had seeped inside
and carbon isotopes in the meteorite match that of coal on @entity11
this has a biological origin - which means @entity14 might be evidence of past extraterrestrial life on @entity5
