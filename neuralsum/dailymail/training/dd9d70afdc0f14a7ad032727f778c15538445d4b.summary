the fight happened at 10am as part of @entity5 's visit to the city for @entity11 , @entity13 's version of comic con			1
mayor @entity2 has been the subject of a recent scandal involving a video that depicted him smoking crack			1
the video has since disappeared his supposed dealers tried shopping the tape to news outlets including @entity33 and the @entity34 , but neither could come up with the $ 200,000 requested			2
eventually @entity33 lost contact with the person selling the video and when they resurfaced the source said it was ' gone '			0
so the match - up with @entity5 may have been an attempt on @entity42 's part to draw attention away from the video , and his even more recent scandal of being seen wandering around drunk at a food festival last weekend			1
before the pr stint , mayor @entity2 talked about not being quite ready to face to wrestler arm to arm			1

i have n't lifted too many weights lately			0
we 'll see what happens , ' he told the @entity34			0
and @entity42 did seem to struggle at first , going bright red in the face and having to readjust his seat			0
giving it his all : the competition got off to the bad start for @entity42 who looked like he was trying much harder than @entity5 mayor @entity5 : during the battle , @entity5 threatened to both rip off @entity42 's arm and take his job comeback kid : despite @entity5 's smack talk , @entity42 still won celebration : @entity42 is certainly not a humble winner			1
he leaps to his feet while @entity5 recovers from the loss champion : @entity5 points to the unlikely champion as ' @entity77 ' plays in the background @entity5 , in true @entity80 form , antagonized the mayor with some smack talk			2
' not only am i going to trip this arm off , i 'm going to take your job , ' he said			0
but @entity2 made a comeback and pushed @entity5 's arm down and jumped up victoriously while ' @entity89 ' started to play .			2
