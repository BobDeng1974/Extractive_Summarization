by @entity0 it is no wonder @entity2 admits he is surprised at how quickly his test call - up has come , given it is less than two months since captain @entity5 said the wicketkeeper was n’t ready for the step up			1
@entity5 ’s verdict came after @entity2 ’s record - breaking century during the fourth one - day international against @entity10 at @entity11 in late may			1
@entity2 had hit 121 off 74 balls as @entity13 came agonisingly close to chasing down 301			1
he has smashed 10 fifties first - class : in 56 four - day games , he hasmanaged just four centuries at an average @entity42 is no wonder @entity2 33.32 , with his strike rate plummeting to 59.17 his hundred , the fastest by an @entity13 batsman in 50 - over cricket , sparked comparisons with @entity50 ’s great wicketkeeper @entity22			1
the 23 - year - old ’s century came off just 61 balls , beating the record of 69 set by @entity54 in 2004			1
@entity2 will now be expected to provide some of the x-factor which has been missing from @entity13 ’s batting since @entity54 was sacked in february			1
a move from @entity24 to @entity58 last winter has paved the way for the keeper ’s elevation			0
it is no surprise @entity63 has called on @entity2 now , given it was his decision to bring him to @entity65 before swapping being coach of @entity58 for the @entity13 job			1
‘ it is a dream come true , ’ said @entity2 on tuesday			1
‘ it ’s probably come sooner than i imagined			0
i still feel i ’ve got improvements to make , but it ’s great i ’ve been named in the squad			0
i ca n’t wait to get started			0
‘ it was a really tough decision to leave @entity24 , but with my long - term goal being @entity75 , i knew i had to leave			2
' i guess it ’s justified it and it ’s justified it pretty quickly			2
i did n’t expect to be playing test cricket this quickly , but in sport opportunities come in different ways and at different times and i ’m delighted			1
’ scrutiny : the duo of @entity5 and coach @entity63 have really struggled so far this summer impact : @entity2 's performances in limited overs internationals have been incredibly impressive @entity2 needs only to look at @entity15 , the man he replaces in the team , for a warning that his keeping will now be under the microscope			1
prior ’s unreliability with the gloves saw him dropped early in his @entity13 career			0
it is one of the reasons he has departed now , with his body unable to withstand the rigours of keeping at the highest level			0
by all accounts , @entity2 ’s glovework , which was shaky at the @entity34 in @entity104 in march , has improved at @entity58 this summer			2
it is with the bat , though , that he excites			0
as well as the record set at @entity11 earlier this summer , he is averaging above 40 in first - class cricket for his county this season — the stand - out innings an unbeaten 100 at @entity113 last month			2
@entity114 will tell if the comparisons with @entity22 are simply hype , but the @entity117 is backing @entity2 to be a success			2
‘ he ’s obviously an effective , creative player who is developing shots and innovative , ’ said @entity22			0
‘ i ’m humbled that incredible judges around the game have compared him to me			0
‘ he ’s a real talent			0
’ @entity124 : 106 ( @entity125 , capt ) @entity127 : 4 ( @entity128 ) @entity129 : 96 ( @entity58 ) @entity130 : 5 ( @entity131 ) @entity132 : 102 ( @entity133 ) @entity134 : 71 ( @entity135 ) @entity136 : 0 ( @entity58 ) @entity137 : 2 ( @entity138 ) @entity139 : 13 ( @entity131 ) @entity140 : 4 ( @entity141 ) @entity142 : 19 ( @entity131 ) @entity143 : 6 ( @entity113 ) @entity144 : 1 ( @entity133 )			0
