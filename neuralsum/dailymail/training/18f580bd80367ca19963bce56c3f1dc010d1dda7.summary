as the daughter of @entity3 musician @entity2 and his second wife , @entity5 @entity4 , actress @entity0 boasts an impressive heritage when it comes to living life in the spotlight			1
but the 25 - year - old actress , who will next be seen on the big screen starring in romantic comedy @entity12 , due for release in the @entity5 on february 6 , has admitted that she feels as though she has inherited ' two polar opposites ' when it comes to her parents diverse personality traits and their unique takes on style			1
' it 's so polar opposite , but that 's me , ' @entity0 explained to @entity22			1
' i have these two different histories			0

@entity69 at @entity70 visit site @entity72 and @entity73 at @entity70 visit site three dots scoop @entity76 at @entity77 visit site lovers + @entity80 at @entity77 visit site out on her own : while appearing in a shoot for @entity22 , the @entity86 , @entity84 star admitted that she refused to use her father 's fame in order to advance her own career while posing in a series of beautifully ethereal images for the online fashion publication , @entity0 also confessed that , when it comes to shopping , her parents have completely different takes on what makes for the perfect trip			1
' i remember [ my dad and i ] used to go to @entity101 and @entity102 together , ' she revealed			0
' we 'd have @entity101 shopping trips together â€” go figure			0
' but while her father enjoyed sharing with her his love of simple main street designs , @entity0 's mother @entity109 , with whom she moved to @entity26 following her parents divorce , passed on a love of vintage fashion finds , making sure to introduce her daughter to some of the world 's best - loved brands			1
' when i was growing up , i was really into vintage , ' @entity0 added			2
' [ my mom ] has all the vintage @entity122 and all these cool pieces that are so hard to find			0
' when it comes to her acting career however , @entity0 was determined to go it alone - without the help of her famous father 's name , or his influence			1
style star : the brunette beauty mixes her mother 's love of unique vintage pieces with a more clean cut @entity137 aesthetic , which she inherited from her time spent living in @entity3 family affair : despite their divorce , @entity0 's parents , musician @entity2 and antiques dealer @entity4 ( pictured with @entity0 on her 23rd birthday ) , appear to be on good terms the screen star , whose big break came in the form of a supporting role in 2009 big screen hit @entity151 , in which she appeared alongside @entity153 winner @entity152 , admitted that she used to drive herself to any auditions or meetings that she needed to attend - and made sure never to mention any details about her father 's profession			1
when it came to preparing for her most recently role however - playing a pregnant teenager in @entity3 - based romantic comedy @entity0 was ready to re-embrace the @entity164 accent that she lost all those years ago			1
and as for portraying the emotional aspects of her character 's unexpected pregnancy , @entity0 could n't have been happier with how the film detailed the journey			1
' @entity84 is very real , and she 's someone who is forced to grow up very quickly , ' she reflected			2
' she is a very strong , empowered young female			0
i found that really inspiring because it was showing this teenage pregnancy in a way that was very uplifting as opposed to negative			0
