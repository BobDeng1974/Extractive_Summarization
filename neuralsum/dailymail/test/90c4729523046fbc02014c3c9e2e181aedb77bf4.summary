patterns appearing on both the very large and very small scale are rare in nature			0
but researchers have found such a pattern in two apparently unrelated places - cells in human skin , and the mysterious fairy circles in @entity9			1
while the distribution of desert fairy circles may look random , as if the landscape is marked with freckles , the pattern closely matches the distribution pattern of skin cells			1
researchers have found a similar pattern in two apparently unrelated places - skin cells and the mysterious fairy circles in the @entity9 desert			1
the illustration on the left shows the distribution of skin cells , and the one on the right plots fairy circles , which are also arranged in polygons ‘ it 's a completely amazing , strange match , ’ said professor @entity28 , head of the @entity29 at @entity30 ( @entity31 ) in @entity32			1
desert fairy circles are considered one of nature 's greatest mysteries because no one knows how they form			1
found in @entity9 , they are large barren patches of earth measuring anywhere between 10ft and 65ft in diameter ( three metres to 20 metres ) that are ringed by short grass dotting the scrub land like craters on the moon , or big freckles			2
several teams of scientists are trying to explain the bizarre markings , and suggestions have included termites nibbling grass , zebras rolling in circles , competition for resources , hydrocarbons emanating from the depths of the earth to kill off patches of vegetation and even aliens			0
@entity66 fairy circles ( pictured ) are considered one of nature 's greatest mysteries because it is now known how they form			2
found in @entity9 , they are large barren patches of earth ringed by short grass dotting the desert like craters on the moon , or big freckles now , professor @entity28 and @entity78 believe they have identified a small , but vital , piece of the puzzle by comparing their distribution to skin cells			1
the duo compared the number of ' neighbours ' adjacent to fairy circles and skin cells , according to the study published in @entity90			1
they used satellite images of fairy circles and a computer to draw lines halfway between each pair to give them invisible boundaries that look similar to cell walls			1
the majority of skin cells and fairy circles both had six ' neighbours ' , and similar percentages of other neighbours ( shown in this graph ) the computer then counted how many neighbours surrounded each fairy circle			1
another group of researchers had calculated skin cell neighbours in a similar way several years ago , which was used as a comparison			2
the experts found that the results were almost identical , in that both the majority of skin cells and fairy circles had six neighbours			1
and the percentage of fairy circles with four , five , six , seven , eight and nine neighbours was essentially the same as the skin cells			1
‘ i did n't expect it to be so close , ’ professor @entity28 said			0
‘ we spent a lot of time checking because it really looked too close to believe			0
’ mr @entity78 , a phd student at @entity128 who was previously at @entity129 that future mathematical models designed to explain how fairy rings are made should incorporate the results of this study			0
the researchers suspect the patterns might be similar because both skin cells and fairy circles are fighting for space			1
professor @entity28 said : ‘ it is still difficult to say why exactly they are similar , but the fact that they are similar is already very important			0
‘ this is suggesting there may be such types of patterns that cover really different size scales			0
’ huge swathes of grassland in @entity9 is covered with mysterious vegetation - free patches that have been baffling scientists for decades			2
while a number of studies have suggested the fairy circles are created by industrious termites , research last may claimed they are the result of resource competition for water among plants			2
@entity164 researchers analysed the spatial distribution of the fairy circles and found that they are ‘ remarkably regular ’ in their distribution , which made them question the termite theory			1
experts from various institutions have previously claimed that termites nibble away at grassroots in certain grasslands of southwest @entity175 , causing the dieback of vegetation and creating a water trap			0
last year , @entity164 researchers analysed the spatial distribution of the fairy circles ( pictured in the @entity181 ) and found that they are ' remarkably regular ' in their distribution			1
there is a no vegetation growth within the circular area the genesis of a fairy circle has not been observed			0
their occurrence appears to be restricted to particularly arid zones at the border of grassland and desert regions , according to the study published in the journal @entity195 , where there is intense resource - competition for water			0
dr @entity200 's team was joined by experts from @entity202 in @entity164 , @entity203 and @entity204 who studied aerial images of the circles in north west @entity9 to pinpoint the location and distribution of the barren patches within the surrounding landscape			2
using statistical methods , they found that the circles are distributed regularly across large areas			0
‘ the occurrence of such patterning in nature is rather unusual			0
there must be particularly strong regulating forces at work , ’ dr @entity200 said			0
he believes it is the local resource - competition among plants and vegetation , in a similar way to how young trees space themselves out in forests to ensure they have access to enough nutrients and water			0
‘ a similar process of resource - competition may consequently also be the real cause for a self - organising formation of the mysterious fairy circle patterns , ’ the study says			2
the scientists simulated underground competition for water and the spatial vegetation distribution patterns			0
they found that similar patterns emerged on the screen to those recorded in @entity9 .			2

it is not known how fairy circles in the @entity9 desert are made
clue may lie in the distribution of the barren circles of @entity252 in grassland
researchers in @entity32 discovered their distribution is similar to skin cells
like human cells , the mysterious circles typically have six ' neighbours '
