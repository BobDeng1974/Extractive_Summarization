by @entity0 published : 18:14 est , 13 march 2014 updated : 03:36 est , 14 march 2014 thousands of people have been sent a distressing hoax email telling them they have cancer , a health watchdog has warned			1
the message appears to be from the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) , and carries the subject line : ‘ important blood analysis result			1
’ seeming to come from an official @entity7 email address , it advises the recipient that their white blood cell count was found to be low after a recent blood test , and that they should visit their gp immediately as cancer is suspected			1
the message appears to be from the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) , and carries the subject line : ' important blood analysis result ' @entity7 said it has been bombarded with phone calls following the hoax , and that those who have had blood tests recently have been particularly alarmed			1
the email says : ‘ we have been sent a sample of your blood analysis for further research			2
during the complete blood count ( @entity31 ) we have revealed that white blood cells is very low , and unfortunately we have a suspicion of a cancer			1
‘ we suggest you to print out your @entity31 test results and interpretations in attachment below and visit your family doctor as soon as possible			0
’ sir @entity39 , @entity7 chief executive , said : ‘ a spam email purporting to come from @entity7 is being sent to members of the public regarding cancer test results			1
‘ this email is likely to cause distress to recipients since it advises that “ test results ” indicate they may have cancer			1
‘ this malicious email is not from @entity7 and we are currently investigating its origin			1
we take this matter very seriously and have reported it to the police			0
’ @entity7 is advising people who have received the email to delete it without opening it , and not to click on any links as it may contain a computer virus			1

@entity62 , 30 , received the email yesterday morning at work			0
the call centre manager , who works in @entity66 , was worried by the message , particularly as she had blood tests for a kidney problem a few weeks ago and has a history of cancer in her family			2
she said : ‘ i ’m used to getting spam but when i saw that email , because i ’ve had blood tests done recently , your heart sinks			2
‘ i did think it could be spam as it had a zip file attached and i know not to open spam emails , but there was a chart saying that my white blood cell count was low and it was from a nice.org.uk email address			1
seeming to come from an official @entity7 email address , it advises the recipient that their white blood cell count was found to be low after a recent blood test , and that they should visit their gp immediately as cancer is suspected ‘ i do n’t know what offends me more – if i received that news via email or that someone is that malicious and they want to get a virus on to my computer that much that they would do something like this			1
’ distressed , she called her boyfriend @entity105 , an it specialist , to tell him about the email			0
mr @entity105 , 30 , from @entity107 , said : ‘ @entity62 called me straight away and was in a bit of a state – as you would be			0
‘ we ’re quite savvy when it comes to things like this and know what a spam email looks like , but you see the word cancer and you do n’t think anyone would do that			2
’ @entity122 , 60 , also received the spam email yesterday morning			0
the self - employed secretary from @entity125 , @entity126 , said : ‘ it was very unpleasant but i did think it was spam			0
‘ it had grammatical errors and a zip file attached			0
i had a blood test about a year ago but i do n’t think it was related			0
i think the people behind it are disgusting and i was very annoyed about it , but it was just too ridiculous			0
’ @entity7 has been using its @entity138 account to reassure concerned recipients that the emails , which it claims are coming from @entity142 and @entity143 , are a hoax			2
