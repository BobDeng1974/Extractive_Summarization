by @entity0 last updated at 7:36 am on 16th january 2012 one in every 17 people could soon be claiming a disability benefit designed for those who can not walk or get around			2
unless reforms proceed , the number being paid @entity5 will rise to 3.5million by 2015 , according to @entity8 forecasts seen by the @entity9			1
this is more than three times the 1.1million who received the benefit when it was created in 1992			2
it is now going to tens of thousands with drug and alcohol problems , asthma and unspecified back pain			2
handouts : one in 17 @entity20 , some 3.5million people , could soon be claiming disability living allowance the allowance , worth up to £ 125 a week , costs the taxpayer £ 12.6billion a year , almost the same as the @entity25 ’s entire £ 13billion budget			1
ministers will set out plans in the @entity28 tomorrow to replace @entity5 with a new benefit , but their proposals are expected to run into significant opposition following a series of defeats over other welfare reforms last week			1
in a concession to disability groups , minister for disabled people @entity35 will today agree to ditch plans to increase the period before claimants can qualify for a new disability benefit from three to six months			2
the change was designed to deter people with temporary health problems from going on to disability handouts			0
' poorly managed ' : minister for disabled people @entity35 hopes to reform social security for the disabled but critics including @entity50 mayor of london @entity51 raised concerns that cancer patients might die before they could get support			0
ministers hope that maintaining the current three - month qualifying period for @entity5 will persuade sceptics in the lords to back their plans			1
the figures seen by the @entity9 suggest that the vast majority of those on the benefit get it for life without even a face - to - face interview			0
ministers say that under the current system , many can get @entity5 without any formal medical assessment , instead simply filling in a form			1
some 71 per cent of claimants have no further check - ups to see if their condition has changed			0
@entity76 @entity76 has triggered a @entity78 row over welfare reform by demanding that the government ’s flagship ‘ benefits cap ’ is watered down			0
the deputy prime minister is also considering an amendment removing child benefit payments from the cap – which may encourage feckless parents to have more children			0
plans for a benefits cap , unveiled in 2010 , would ensure that no family will receive more than £ 26,000 a year in benefits – equal to average earnings			1
but under mr @entity76 ’s proposals , tens of thousands of existing families , mainly in @entity94 , could be given years of ‘ transitional relief ’ , or even exempted from the cap altogether			0
@entity98 have sided with @entity99 and crossbench peers to defeat the @entity101 , blowing a £ 2billion black hole in the government ’s spending plans			2
the @entity78 plans to scrap @entity5 and replace it with a new benefit , called the @entity106 ( @entity106 )			1
potential claimants will have a face - to - face interview and assessment before qualifying , followed by regular check - ups			0
@entity106 will reduce numbers of claimants aged between 16 and 64 by half a million , ministers will say			0
but the 340,000 most severely disabled people will get the higher rate of benefit			0
the proportion who will receive the higher rate will actually increase under the government ’s reforms			0
mrs @entity35 told the @entity9 : ‘ in the past , @entity5 has been poorly managed so we now have a situation where there are hundreds of millions of pounds of overpayments , and the vast majority of people get the benefit for life without systematic checks to see if their condition has changed			1
‘ we are replacing @entity5 with @entity106 and introducing a new face - to - face assessment and regular reviews – something missing under the current system			1
' under @entity106 , support will be focused on those who need it most , with a greater proportion getting the higher rates compared with @entity5			1
’ work and pensions secretary @entity142 has pledged to slash £ 2.17billion from the vast annual bill for @entity5 by 2015			1
nearly a million people have been on the benefit for 14 years or more			0
but cuts to @entity5 , which was designed to help people who have specific mobility or care needs , and can not do tasks such as walking , washing or dressing themselves , are under increasing criticism by charities and @entity156 mps			1
@entity158 figures show that the mobility component of @entity5 is paid to 19,400 people with drug or alcohol problems , 30,900 people with asthma and 128,300 people with ‘ unspecified ’ back pain .			2

@entity5 costs £ 12.6bn a year
