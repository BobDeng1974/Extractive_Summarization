by @entity0 pressure : stress caused by personal problems as well as trouble at work during middle age could lead to the onset of dementia , scientists have warned getting divorced , losing a partner or struggling with work problems in middle - age could increase your risk of suffering dementia in later life , warn researchers			1
they found conditions such as @entity20 ’s may be linked to the amount of stress experienced up to four decades earlier			1
common stressful life events can have ‘ severe and long - standing physiological and psychological consequences ’ in the brain , claims a study that investigated the effects of stress on middle - aged women			1
the study began in 1968 when 800 @entity31 women underwent neuropsychiatric tests , which were repeated in 1974 , 1980 , 1992 , 2000 and 2005			1
at the initial assessment , the women , who were born in 1914 , 1918 , 1922 and 1930 , were asked if and how they had suffered from the impact of 18 different types of dramatic events , known as psychosocial stressors			0
these included divorce , becoming a widow , work problems , serious problems with children and ill - health in a relative , including mental illness			1
one in four women had suffered at least one stressful event , 23 per cent reported two , one in five had suffered three and 16 per cent had been through four or more , says a report in the online journal @entity51			0
during the assessment period , 19 per cent ( 153 ) of them developed dementia , with 104 of these being diagnosed with @entity20 ’s disease			1
the number of stressors reported in 1968 was associated with a 21 per cent greater risk of developing @entity20 ’s and a 15 per cent extra risk of developing any type of dementia in later life			1
the report said : ‘ common stressors may have severe and long - standing physiological and psychological consequences			0
‘ the number of psychosocial stressors measured in middle - aged women was related to distress and incidence of alzheimer ’s disease almost four decades later			2
’ an increase in stress hormones in the body can cause harmful changes in the brain associated with heart disease , high blood pressure and dementia			0
lasting effect : higher levels of stress hormones can be measured several decades after traumatic events , experts have found the researchers said higher levels of stress hormones can even be measured several decades after traumatic events , as found in @entity89 survivors			2
they called for more investigations to assess whether more therapy should be given to people who suffer from stressful events in their lives			0
dr @entity95 , director of research and development at the @entity97 , said : ‘ we all go through stressful events			0
understanding how these events may become a risk factor for the development of alzheimer ’s disease is key to helping us find ways of preventing or treating the condition			0
’ dr @entity105 , head of research at @entity107 , said : ‘ these types of studies are important for highlighting areas for further investigation			0
‘ from this study , it is hard to know whether stress contributes directly to the development of dementia , whether it is an indicator of another underlying risk factor , or whether the link is due to an entirely different factor			2

conditions such as @entity20 *'s* may be linked to *mid-life* stress
divorce , *bereavement* and trouble at work can all be factors
@entity31 study finds that effects of trauma can be traced decades later
