mr @entity2 - who earns £ 1.2million a year - said pay fairness should not be achieved by ' cutting down success			1
' he caved in and waived a near £ 1million performance payout for 2011 after intense public and political pressure			2
mr @entity2 said he surrendered the bonus - to be paid in shares - because of the damage the row was doing to the bank			2
speaking publicly for the first time after the furore , he suggested it would have been an easy decision to walk out of the bank once his bonus came under threat			2
mr @entity2 told @entity27 's today programme : ' i am not a robot and there has been some deeply depressing moments over the last three years			1
' in the end , i came to the conclusion that it would be indulgent for me to resign			0
' he said he ' drew on inner strength ' to continue at the bank which is 83 per cent owned by the taxpayer			2
mr @entity2 added he had been tasked with ' defusing a ticking timebomb ' and the spotlight placed on him made the job more difficult			1
the 51 - year - old said it was wrong to attack successful people - although added that what bankers are paid is a political decision			1
' i believe strongly in issues to do with equality of opportunity			0
i believe in a progressive tax system - i have no problem in paying more tax , ' he said			2
' but i do n't think cutting off success or cutting down success is the way to go about fairness in society			2
' he caved in and surrendered his bonus after @entity62 ’s announced it would force a @entity64 debate on the payments at the bank , allowing mps to vote on the bonus			2
resignation fears : @entity3 chief executive @entity2 revealed today he nearly quit in a row over his bonus			1
he is pictured speaking to journalists today @entity2 may have waived his £ 963,000 shares bonus - but he could still walk away with £ 39m during his time at @entity3			1
the bank had already set aside £ 3.3million for mr @entity2 ’s bonus next year			1
that is on top of the potential £ 35.5million package he has enjoyed since he moved to @entity3 in 2008			1
it is made up of pay , pension , bonuses , shares and a long - term incentive plan that is worth up to £ 4.8million a year , four times his £ 1.2million basic salary , and is due to start paying out from 2014 if he hits certain targets			1
this is how it is calculated : 2008 : £ 4.99million in shares instead of pay and bonuses ; 2009 : £ 6.9million total package ; 2010 : £ 8.16million total package ; 2011 : £ 8.08million total package ; 2012 : £ 7.38million total , including up to £ 4.8million long - term incentive plan , salary of £ 1.2million , £ 420,000 in pension contributions and his bonus which was worth £ 963,000 when issued last week but was expected to top £ 1million as @entity3 shares rise in value			1
the bonus has , of course , now been waived			0
2013 : @entity3 have set aside £ 3.3million of shares for his bonus next year			1
the exact size will be decided this time next year			2
mr @entity2 ’s shares - only payment was worth around £ 963,000 , but he could yet pocket as much as £ 39million in total during his time with @entity3			1
the bank had already set aside £ 3.3million for mr @entity2 ’s bonus next year			1
he said he surrendered the 2011 payment because it was hurting the bank			0
' i took the judgment that it was going to be damaging for @entity3 to stay in the intensity of the spotlight that we had got into , ' he said			2
mr @entity2 spoke publicly for the first time about his decision to waive his bonus today after revealing to staff that the restructuring of @entity3 has already cost £ 38billion			1
the money has gone on disposing of assets , loan losses and restructuring charges			0
the government 's stake in the bank cost £ 45billion and the final cost of the restructuring could yet surpass this			1
mr @entity2 said today that while he had ' great sympathy and understanding ' for people concerned about the high rewards in the banking industry , such ' societal issues ' were ultimately a matter for politicians			1
he said it was essential that @entity3 was able to recruit the best people to resolve the problems it had inherited from the former management , which led to it being bailed out by the taxpayer			1
' when i was asked to take on this job three years ago , i had to replace the whole senior management team of @entity3 , ' he said			1
' we had to go around the world looking for the best people , not just people to run a bank well , but people to defuse the biggest timebomb in history in terms of bank balance sheets			1
' those people are doing a good job			0
i think they deserve recognition			0
if they do a good job , it is our task to make sure that there is a connection between the job people are doing and how they get treated			0
' fat cats : mr @entity2 's near £ 1million bonus payout for 2011 sparked a public and political outcry mr @entity2 acknowledged that bank bonuses were controversial but said @entity3 had not realised what a storm his award would create			1
' i understand why these issues are controversial - particularly in a time of austerity			0
of course , we underestimated that , going forward , ' he said			0
he admitted the banks had been guilty of ' hubris ' after 20 years of ' unbridled expansion ' leading up to the crash of 2008			2
' i think in the case of the banking industry there was over-confidence and , with the benefit of hindsight , over-rewards , ' he said			1
however he warned it was important not to ' demonise ' a sector which remained essential to the economy			1
' let 's not demonise a whole industry			2
let 's not demonise something that is fundamental to the world economy , ' he said			2
' banking is important , financial services is important			0
it supports the economy , it supports millions of jobs and we need to remember that			0
' while he acknowledged that as a largely state - owned organisation , @entity3 would be held to a higher standard than other banks , he said it could not be treated completely differently			1
' it may make our job more difficult			0
we have to try to behave in a way that also leads on some of these difficult issues of how we interact with society , ' he said			0
' we ca n't be completely different from all the people against who we compete but i accept that we need to have a sensitivity			0
' he added : ' we would make a mistake as a society if we forget how wealth is generated , how successful people are motivated			0
' stripped : @entity228 today faced calls to be stripped of this honorary degree he received from @entity231 @entity228 should be stripped of his honorary degree , students at a top university said today			0
the former @entity3 chief - stripped of his knighthood last week - was made a doctor of @entity238 by @entity231 in @entity239 in 2004			1
but the @entity240 has now called for the university to revoke the degree because of his role in the collapse of @entity245 's biggest bank			0
president @entity246 said : ' we believe that keeping in place an honorary degree for someone like @entity228 runs contrary to the values of the @entity231			0
' @entity228 , of course , is not solely responsible for the banking crisis although his awards were made for ‘ services to banking ' - a statement which has no foundation			2
' @entity261 ' has , over the course of the banking crisis , become a symbol of arrogance , misjudgement and greed which many people feel has become endemic within our banking system			0
' to defend the award devalues our system of honorary graduates such as sir @entity272 and sir @entity273 who have gained one through their contributions to society			0
' if the @entity278 and the @entity279 can take the extraordinary measure of revoking his knighthood , then it seems fairly obvious that the university can do the same with his honorary degree			0
' but a university spokesman insisted that @entity228 was given an honorary degree in ' good faith ' and there were no plans to remove it			0
he added : ' clearly , a great deal has changed since that time			0
the university is very sensitive to the varied opinions expressed about mr @entity228 's part in the collapse of @entity3 and its damaging effects on the economy and the lives of many thousands of people			1
' revoking the degree , however , can not change history , nor ameliorate the harm done by by the banking collapse , for which many people and institutions , not just the one man , are responsible			0
' in these circumstances , the university will not be pressured into making the precipitate gesture of revoking mr @entity228 's degree			0
