few dare to mess with @entity1 , the chancellor ’s cat with an impressive reputation for mouse - catching			1
she has gained the upper hand in a dawn catfight with his neighbour @entity8 , the prime minister ’s cat who is better known for ‘ chillaxing ’			2
but it appears the latest addition to @entity16 ’s menagerie at @entity17 might be winning a new power struggle at @entity19			1
' showdown on @entity19 ' : @entity1 the cat stands her ground against new addition @entity24 over the weekend , the chancellor posted a photograph which he had taken of @entity24 , his new puppy , and @entity1 , his old moggy , on @entity28			1
the caption read simply : ‘ showdown at @entity19			0
’ while @entity1 cowers under the table , @entity24 - a @entity32 puppy who is only a few months old - is looking on inquisitively			1
last night , @entity19 insiders insisted the pair are good friends despite the traditionally dysfunctional relationship between cats and dogs			1
he insisted : ‘ @entity1 is not aggressive			1
she is just a bit more efficient than @entity8 when it comes to mouse - catching			2
’ @entity44 looks as though he was struggling a little during a jog this weekend mr @entity16 also has a budgie called @entity47 , named after @entity47 , who led @entity49 on the @entity51 raid , and two goldfish , whose names are not known			1
@entity1 has emerged from a troubled past			1
she was bought by the chancellor and his wife , @entity56 , for their two children in 2009 , initially living with them at their home in @entity60 , west @entity61			0
she went missing , but was eventually returned after being found by a former neighbour who was helped by a microchip under the cat ’s skin carrying mrs @entity67 ’s phone number			2
but in @entity19 suspicion was rife that @entity1 may have been carrying other electronic devices in order to infiltrate the heart of government and the @entity72			2
a @entity74 source said at the time ‘ some of us think the @entity76 got her			0
‘ you ’d only have to bug her and you could find out half the government ’s secrets			0
’ @entity24 is believed to be the first dog to inhabit @entity19 since @entity82 was prime minister in the 1960s and brought his yellow labrador @entity85 with him			2
the stand off comes as @entity44 was feeling the strain as he pounded the streets of @entity89 in his jogging gear			0
he tries to go for a twice - weekly jog in the parks near @entity19 , at ‘ strange times of the day ’ so as not to attract attention			0
the prime minister said in a radio interview last week he was never recognised by tourists who thought he was just another ‘ middle aged slightly overweight man ’ as he trotted past			0
despite his regular runs , he has admitted his age is starting to ‘ creep up on him ’ when it comes to more strenuous exercise			0
he has not followed in the footsteps of @entity105 , who recently told how he had taken up kickboxing to keep his weight down .			0

@entity16 posted *dramatic* picture on @entity28 of family puppy and cat
shows long - standing family *pet* @entity1 staring down new puppy @entity24
insiders insist the pair are actually good friends
