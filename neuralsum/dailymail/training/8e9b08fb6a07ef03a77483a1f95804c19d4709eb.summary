' @entity14 urged ' i encourage anyone looking for an animal to adopt from a shelter and save a life ! ' she continued			1
@entity14 is widely regarded as the most successful female skier of all time , but a february 2013 knee injury while skiing in @entity127 has since seriously sidetracked her career			1
until last tuesday , @entity14 had remained upbeat nonetheless			2
less than two weeks after reconstructive right knee surgery in february 2013 , she was already sounding a positive note , saying she was ' really looking forward to @entity132 ' and defending her @entity134 downhill gold medal			1
along the way to the next @entity136 , though , @entity14 began facing more setbacks			1
as she 'd move past one , another would surface			0
in the end , it was too much , even for @entity14 , the most accomplished @entity142 ski racer in history			2
expected to be one of the biggest stars at the upcoming games , @entity14 announced tuesday — exactly one month before the opening ceremony — she wo n't be able to race in @entity148 ' he has a bad knee , just like me ' : the dog @entity14 chose was hit by a car and has since needed surgery on his leg ' this definitely brightened my day ' : sidelined skier @entity3 brought home a rescue dog after announcing she ca n't compete in next month 's @entity5 friends : ' he has a bad knee , just like me , ' a limping @entity14 told reporters when she first got the pup from a @entity20 animal shelter in a @entity61 posting , @entity14 said she is ' devastated ' to miss the @entity13 , ' but the reality has sunk in that my knee is just too unstable to compete at this level			1
' like many in her risk - filled sport , @entity14 has dealt with injuries often , particularly at major events			2
she withdrew midway through the 2011 world championships because of a concussion			0
she raced with a severely bruised shin at the last @entity13			0
she skipped a race at the 2009 worlds after slicing her thumb open on a champagne bottle			0
she hurt her knee in training and missed a pair of races at the 2007 worlds			0
she took a scary fall during training at the @entity187 , then left the hospital to compete			0
' she 's come back			0
she 'll be back , ' @entity14 's father , @entity189 , said in a telephone interview			2
' you 'll see a lot of @entity3 in the future			0
' @entity14 left the 2010 @entity194 with two medals : the first @entity134 downhill gold for an @entity142 woman , and a bronze in the super- @entity199 she is also a four - time overall @entity201 champion , by far the most recognized name in @entity203 at the moment — and , as it happens , the girlfriend of @entity87			1
withdrawal : @entity3 and her partner @entity87 were together the day before christmas eve when the skier first met the kindred spirit canine add it all up , and she would have been the focus of plenty of media coverage in @entity132 , certainly a main character in @entity217 's coverage for a @entity142 audience			1
' @entity3 gives you great promotional value , and she 's an amazing athlete and an amazing story , ' said @entity222 , president of @entity13			0
' but there are amazing athletes that are going to be in @entity132 , many of which we know , some of which we have n't identified yet			0
' to those in the world of skiing , there 's no doubt about the sport 's most important athlete of late			0
' without @entity3 , the races are just not the same , ' @entity239 women 's @entity203 coach @entity237 said last month			2
' she just attracts so much interest			0
when @entity3 is here , there are more people coming to watch the race , there is more interest on tv , more journalists are interested			0
and her relationship with @entity87 makes even more people interested			0
' @entity3 of the @entity142 is helicoptered off the course during the @entity251 on february 05 , 2013 in @entity252 , @entity127 painstaking : in march 2013 - skier @entity3 published this picture to @entity51 that revealed the extent of her injury and subsequent surgery to fix the damage caused but @entity14 has rarely been present on the elite skiing circuit the past 12 months			1
she tore two ligaments in her right knee and broke a bone in that leg during a high - speed crash at the world championships last february			1
as @entity14 neared a return , she re-tore her surgically repaired @entity266 in a crash during training in november			0
after finishing 40th , 11th and fifth in a trio of @entity201 races at @entity271 , @entity272 , in early december , @entity14 sprained her mcl during a downhill at @entity275 , @entity276 , two weeks later			0
' i did everything i possibly could to somehow get strong enough to overcome having no @entity266 , ' @entity14 said on tuesday via her @entity61 page .			0

@entity3 picked up her new nine - month - old dog named @entity17 at @entity282 in @entity283 , @entity20 , last week

@entity14 suffered a devastating injury to her right knee in february 2013 and will miss the @entity136 in @entity132 this year
