a popular holiday beach in the north of @entity2 has transformed into something from a horror movie as wild winds and relentless thunderstorms continue to batter the state			2
@entity8 , who was enjoying a family trip away at @entity10 in the @entity11 , about 95kms north of @entity12 , filmed the disturbing scene that stretched out more than 15 metres from the top of the beach pathway to beyond the water 's edge			1
' it 's foam that has been swept off the top of the waves because the water was so churned up and its mixed with sand - it 's so bizarre , ' ms @entity8 told @entity24			1
' her videos - which were filmed on tuesday - show a grotesque , yellow , jelly like substance moving around as the wind blows it up and over surrounding scrubland			1
they are titled ' foam party ' , ' i feel like @entity47 ' and ' beach gone			2
possibly about to be swept to sea '			0
@entity8 ( pictured ) filmed the disturbing scene that stretched out for more than 15 metres ' it 's foam that has been swept off the top of the waves because the water was so churned up and its mixed with sand - it 's so bizarre , ' she said ms @entity8 and her family were forced to leave the holiday house after their power went out on tuesday			1
' the foam just felt like you were in a snow globe ' ' it 's hard to say how much was foam and how much had water underneath , but there would have been a good 15 metres or so of that stuff , ' ms @entity8 , the co-founder of @entity66 , said			1
' it was covering the shrubbery and the whole walk way down to the beach			2
' ms @entity8 said she and her family were forced to ditch their holiday plans and head back to their @entity12 home in @entity81 earlier than they 'd intended due to the severe storm			2
' @entity10 does n't have very much distance between houses and the shore line , so when high tide came up the water was flooding the pathways all down the beach so i was freaking out and thought it would swallow all the houses up , ' she said			1
' when we went outside we realised it was n't all water - it was foam			0
' ' we left yesterday afternoon because all the power went out , there was no electricity , we could n't use the heaters and the house was freezing , there was no mobile or internet so we could n't do anything so we just picked a moment in the night and left			0
' the wind was just insane			0
the whole house was howling and it was crazy			0
' a quick trip to the nearby town of @entity111 , where ms @entity8 and her family tried to find some power , proved fruitless when they found that numerous homes had lost their roofs and the normally flat beach had pounding waves which the @entity81 resident described as ‘ just mental ’			1
it comes as a second intense low pressure system , centred off the coast of the @entity123 , is predicted to bring heavier rains and more large seas and thunderstorms to large parts of northern @entity12 and the @entity11 on wednesday			0
the @entity128 has received more than 8000 requests for help and has conducted 90 flood rescues since monday , while about 200,000 homes and businesses remain without power			0
more than 260 @entity128 crews and 600 volunteers will be out in the field on wednesday while the worst storm in a decade continues to batter the state			0

winds swept the ocean foam off *lashing* waves before mixing it with sand from the shore line
the result was a bizarre and grotesque yellow , thick , jelly - like foam substance which coated the entire beach
it stretched more than 15 metres up @entity10 in the @entity11 and onto the pathways and shrubbery
@entity8 , who was holidaying there when the storm hit , *captured* the *strange* *phenomenon* on her camera
