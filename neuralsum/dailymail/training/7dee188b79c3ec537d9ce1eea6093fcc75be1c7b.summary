by @entity0 published : 06:08 est , 30 november 2012 updated : 10:12 est , 30 november 2012 a pair of @entity4 @entity3 stars have sacrificed their million - dollar paychecks and quit their top - flight american football teams - to go on a pilgrimage to @entity8			1
@entity9 and @entity10 are at the peak of their careers , playing every week in front of tens of thousands of cheering fans at the heart of two of @entity19 's top gridiron teams			1
but in june this year , the pair broke the news to their respective coaches that they would not be available to play in the 2012 @entity3 season because they were taking their ailing parents on a 7,000 - mile ' road trip ' to @entity30 's spiritual heartland			1
@entity31 , 29 , a first - team starter for the @entity32 and @entity10 , 27 , of the @entity33 , have enjoyed highly successful careers in @entity35 , climbing the ranks from little leagues , to high school and college football to the @entity3			1
faith : @entity41 ( left ) , 29 , left the @entity32 while his brother @entity10 ( right ) , 27 , quit the @entity33 to make the trip to @entity30 's religious heartland in october high flyers : @entity9 ( left ) and @entity10 ( right ) both earn around a million dollars a year as @entity3 players but in a country so polarised by perceptions of faith , both say they have experienced islamophobic abuse on and off the field			1
far from accept it as an inescapable byproduct of multiculturalism , however , it inspired them to use their high - profile status to educate fellow @entity19 in a bid to nurture a better understanding of their faith			1
' you know , ' @entity9 told @entity63			1
' we 're playing football , @entity19 's number one game			1
we went on a road trip			1
what 's more @entity19 than a road trip ? ' born and bred in tough @entity72 , the brothers say no amount of success could satisfy their aching desire to honour the most demanding of the five pillars of @entity30 - the hajj			1
on the flight : they swapped their gridirons for ' ihrams ' as they made the 7,000 - mile journey loyal : @entity9 ( far left ) and @entity10 ( far right ) @entity10 took their ailing parents on the 7,000 - mile trip to @entity30 's religious heartland in october after telling their coaches they would not be available to play in the 2012 @entity3 season in the crowds : the brothers swapped their on - field body armour for traditional @entity30 clothing designed to make it impossible to tell who is rich and who is poor it is a journey all able - bodied @entity4 are required to make at least once in their lifetime and is the largest spiritual pilgrimage in the world			1
' we ’ve been playing football since we were 8 years old , ' @entity10 told @entity63			1
' and although we 're knocking down all these barriers , doing things that people said you ca n't do , all of a sudden , it was like there 's more to life than this			2
and we had to go for it			0
' the brothers decided to take with them their mother , a teacher , and ailing father , a former carpenter whose chronic diabetes leaves him needing daily dialysis treatment			0
popular : the brothers in @entity8 with a group of @entity124 @entity3 fans celebrity : even in @entity8 the borthers were recognised by @entity3 fans ( pictured : @entity9 and a young fan ) the @entity129 : the @entity130 is one of the largest spiritual pilgrimages in the world and is embraced by nearly two million people each year but before they embarked on the mission , they spent 30 days travelling @entity19 , having ' @entity137 ' - the daily @entity139 fast - breaking meal - at a different mosque each night while giving talks on fasting and its impact on athletes			1
the journey that followed was a far cry from the luxury they had become accustomed to as coveted sports stars in their homeland			1
the @entity130 is one of the largest spiritual pilgrimages in the world and is embraced by nearly two million people each year			0
many make the journey to @entity8 , in @entity124 , as it is laid down in the @entity153 that the journey is a duty that must be carried out at least once by every able bodied @entity4 , provided they can afford it			0
it takes place during the last month of the @entity30 year , known as @entity159 and once there pilgrims are required to walk seven times around @entity8 's most sacred site , the @entity129 , a cuboid shaped building in the centre of the holy city			2
although pilgrimages to @entity8 are thought to date as far back as @entity170 , it is believed that the first hajj , in which the prophet @entity172 led his followers from @entity174 to @entity8 , was performed by @entity4 alone in the 7th century			2
once there @entity172 is said to have cleansed the @entity129 and re-ordained the building as the house of @entity178			0
from this point the hajj became one of the @entity182			2
the other four pillars are @entity184 , a statement recited in @entity186 , the @entity187 , five daily prayers , the ritual fasting of the @entity189 and the @entity190 , a charitable donation			0
it involved travelling in packed buses for many hours on end , bustling through vast crowds and sleeping on the floors of makeshift accomodation erected to help house the two million pilgrims that visit @entity8 every year			2
first they traveled by plane to @entity124 then made a series of long - haul bus journeys - some of which became stuck in traffic jams of up to 12 hours at a time - before completing their journey on foot			2
they also swapped their on - field body armour for the requisite ' ihram ' , a garment of two sheets of white , unhemmed cloth worn by pilgrims to make it impossible to tell who is rich and who is poor			0
@entity9 said the trip shattered any preconceptions he had about negative foreign feeling towards the @entity19			1
he said the first thing he noticed was ' how much the other @entity4 we met love @entity19 '			2
he said he was ambushed by a surprising and overwhelming sense of pride at being @entity19			2
but it has not always been so			0
both men have found themselves victims of islamophobic abuse both on and off the field , especially since 9/11 rocked the nation			0
but far from roll over and accept the wave of anti-muslim sentiment that swept the country in the wake of the attack , they saw it as an opportunity to use their status as high - profile sports stars to educate their fellow @entity19 in a bid to nurture a better understanding of their faith			1
@entity9 said he believes 9/11 was an ' educational opportunity ' that ' opened the eyes of a lot of people ' and forced many @entity19 to ask questions about a faith of which many knew next to nothing			1
he said : ' [ people ] would ask : " can you guys kill people ? " and i would ask them : " in what book does it say that you can go and do acts of terrorism ? " the @entity153 does n’t say that			0
@entity30 is a religion of peace			0
' since taking their leave of absence , both brothers are now free agents , with no certainty of a future in the @entity3			0
indeed , in a country so polarised by perceptions of faith , would this overt celebration of their religious beliefs hinder their return to big league @entity35 ? they think not			0
' a lot of the times [ the concept of being @entity4 and @entity19 ] gets lost in translation , ' @entity9 said			1
' @entity30 is our religion , yes			0
but our country is the @entity19			2
