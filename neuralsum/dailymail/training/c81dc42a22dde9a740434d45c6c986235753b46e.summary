by @entity0 for any self respecting scuba assassin , they are the essential weapons			2
from the @entity6 underwater pistol to the the @entity7 that can shoot darts , weapons makers have created a whole line of underwater weapons			1
as normal guns and ammunition do not work underwater , they also have their own ammunition , with many firing darts rather than bullets			1
therefore , weapons designers based underwater pistols on spears rather than bullets , shrinking them down to fit in a handheld gun			1
the first weapon is believed to be @entity34 's @entity6			1
originally designed in the 1970 's , it fires up to five fin stabilized , rocket propelled darts that are self contained inside individual barrels			0
since ordinary - shaped rounds are inaccurate and have a very short range when used underwater , this pistol fires steel darts about 10 centimetres ( 3.9 in ) long			1
it has five barrels , each of which is loaded with a cartridge			0
after firing all five cartridges , the barrel unit must be sent back to its manufacturer for reloading			0
the darts measure 7.62mm @entity55 and are effective underwater to about 50 feet near the surface , with decaying range the deeper you descend into the abyss			1
above water , the @entity6 has a range of about 100 feet , although experts say its accuracy is poor			2
the @entity64 , originally designed in the 1970 's @entity66 also developed underwater weapons			2
the @entity68 was made in the @entity69 for use underwater by @entity69 frogmen as an underwater firearm			0
it was developed in the late 1960s and accepted for use in 1971			0
it fires a round - based 4.5 millimetres ( 0.18 in ) caliber steel dart about 115 millimetres ( 4.5 in ) long			0

@entity66 continued to build underwater weapons , and lat year unveiled the @entity98 designed by @entity66 's @entity100 , it can be fitted with silencers and grenade launchers , and fire both on land and in water			2
it is equipped with a 40 mm grenade launcher which has a range of 400 m. the underwater ' @entity109 ' : @entity66 showcases its first ever efficient amphibious assault rifle , the ads it can fire at a rate of 700 shots / min with a range on land of 500 m. the weapon 's effective underwater firing range when using the specially designed cartridge is about 25 meters at a depth of 30 meters , it is claimed			1
the ads was under extensive field trials by undisclosed units of @entity66 @entity123 special forces .			0

weapons were first developed in the 1970s - and their existence was kept *secret* for decades
