more senior bank bosses are to face hefty fines if they fail to prevent wrongdoing under a crackdown on @entity5 failure by the @entity6			1
new rules to hold senior figures to account when things go wrong are to be extended to also cover non-executive directors to force them to ' run their firms responsibly '			1
but there are concerns the move could deter the best people from rising through the ranks , fearing being held to account for problems on their watch			1
new rules to hold senior figures to account when things go wrong are to be extended to also cover non-executive directors to force them to ' run their firms responsibly ' the @entity6 is strengthening rules covering senior bankers , known as the @entity24			1
it includes the threat of a lifetime ban , large fines and the power to jail bankers for reckless misconduct			1
sanctions will be imposed if a senior manager responsible for an area where a breach of the rules occurred ' can not demonstrate that they took reasonable steps to avoid or stop it '			1
in addition to bank chairmen , it will cover senior independent directors , and the heads of risk , audit and remuneration committees			2
there is also a new criminal offence which could see senior managers held liable for reckless decisions leading to the failure of a bank			2
the tougher rules were drawn up in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and scandals including bank mis - selling and rigging lending rates			2
@entity59 , deputy governor and head of the @entity6 's @entity61 , said : ' senior managers will be held individually accountable if the areas they are responsible for fail to meet our requirements			2
' our new accountability regime will hold all senior managers , including non-executive directors , to a clear standard of behaviour and we will take action where they fail to meet this			1
' in an article in the @entity75 he stressed that expanding the scope of the rules was the right way to ensure that those responsible for the running of financial institutions are held to account			2
he said : ' organisations need to make sure they have on the board people with the right skills , who are prepared to dedicate an appropriate amount of time to this vital role			0
' it is not our intention that non-executives should take on executive roles , which would compromise their independence as a result of these regulatory changes			0
' @entity59 , the head of the @entity6 's @entity61 , said senior managers must be individually accountable he insisted that the new criminal offence will only be used ' in the most egregious cases ' , adding : ' we do not seek to collect scalps			0
success will be well - governed firms , where senior managers know what is expected and run their firms responsibly			0
' however the threat of the new rules sparked claims that senior bankers would resign			0
last year @entity110 was forced to deny that the threat of jail led to at least one resignation from its board			0
@entity115 , a partner at law firm @entity116 , said widening the rules to cover non-executive directors would mean banks will ' will lose some good people , and perhaps take on some of the b team instead '			1
he told the ft : ' their liability is greater than ever , not least because of the reversal of the burden of proof			0
fines are likely to be significantly higher than before as the regulators seek to make examples at the top of the industry			0
who needs that at the end of their careers ? '			0
