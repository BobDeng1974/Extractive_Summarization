since he took a chunk out of @entity4 's finger in 2009 , clairvoyant groundhog @entity0 has never had the smoothest relationships with @entity7 mayors			1
but now mayor - groundhog tensions appear to have taken an even more sinister turn , after it was revealed that @entity10 could well be responsible for the animal 's death			1
in february this year , current mayor mr @entity10 dropped the @entity14 groundhog in front of a crowd of spectators after the animal predicted six more miserable weeks of winter			1
according to the @entity31 , the zoo - which gets nearly half of its $ 3.5 million in annual funding from the city - told the staff to keep the mayor 's office in the dark about the groundhog 's sad death			2
in a further twist , it appears that @entity0 was not in fact @entity0 at all , but was actually a female imposter named @entity46 , sources told the newspaper yesterday			2
it is thought that @entity46 was brought in as an emergency measure because the zoo feared the volatile @entity0 would bite mayor @entity10 , as he did mayor @entity4 five years ago			1
the plot thickens as it appears that @entity0 could in fact be stand - in groundhog @entity46 the zoo does not make public that it has stand - in groundhogs to protect the ' groundhog brand , ' insiders said			1
the female stand - in was found dead in her enclosure at the @entity28 on february 9 and a necropsy determined she died from ' acute internal injuries , ' sources said			1
she had fallen nearly six feet when the mayor lost his grip during the @entity65 photo - op exactly seven days earlier			0
sources said her injuries were consistent with a fall			0
' @entity0 and my predecessor did n’t always get along , let ’s be honest about that			2
but i ’m hoping we can start a new day , a new relationship here , ' mr @entity10 joked at the time			2
' i ’m reaching out a hand to chuck and i hope he will consider shaking it rather than doing other things			0
' but the mayor had no such luck and the animal wriggled from his hands and leapt to the ground ' now @entity0 , what about this winter thing , @entity0 ? we can work something out , ca n’t we ? ' the mayor added			2
a zoo spokesperson tried to downplay the mayor 's role in @entity0 / @entity46 's death , saying the animal was examined after the fall and seemed fine			1
' it appears unlikely that the animal 's death is related to the events on @entity65 , ' the spokesperson said @entity10 was hoping to forge a better relationship with groundhog @entity0 than his predecessor @entity102 handler @entity101 holds up @entity104 the furry rodent is one of a small group of groundhogs said to forecast the weather , including @entity0 in @entity14 assemblyman @entity109 told the @entity31 : ' i was told he died of old age , that he went to that big farm in the sky			1
' the mayor 's office only heard the news of the groundhog 's death when approached by the paper			0
' we were unaware that @entity121 had passed but are sorry to hear of the loss , ' said spokesman @entity123			0
according to zoo sources , there are plans to pull the same groundhog switch next year by using the groundhog couple 's young daughter - also named @entity46 - in the role of @entity0			1
@entity104 is held by @entity131 after emerging from his burrow			0
legend has it that if the animal sees his shadow , winter will last another month - and - a - half			0
if he does n't see it , spring will come early @entity0 / @entity46 is one of a small group of groundhogs said to forecast the weather , the most famous being @entity142 's @entity104 legend has it that if the furry rodent sees his shadow on february 2 , winter will last another month - and - a - half			1
if he does n't see it , spring will come early			0
the annual event - made world famous by the 1993 @entity150 comedy ' @entity65 ' - draws thousands of tourists from as far afield as @entity152 and @entity153			0
a version of @entity104 has been making weather predictions since 1887 , but since the release of the popular movie crowds of up to 30,000 have made their way to @entity142 to witness the ceremony			0
@entity102 handler @entity160 holds @entity104 in february this year at the annual celebrations			0
