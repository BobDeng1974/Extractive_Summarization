by @entity0 @entity1 may have descended yesterday on the @entity3 ‘ carnival ’ in @entity4 ahead of the @entity6 poll tomorrow			2
but if you want to see how chaotic the elections really are , consider the ballot papers that await voters on thursday			0
the one for the @entity13 region includes the names of a staggering 127 candidates representing 17 different political parties			1
the proportional voting system of the @entity6 elections favours small parties , meaning scores of fringe groups have been set up to sabotage @entity22 's @entity3 in total , there are 12 @entity26 electoral areas in @entity27			1
overall , a mind - boggling 757 candidates , representing 39 parties , are vying to be chosen as @entity27 ’s 73 meps			1
as in previous @entity6 elections there is a baffling array of fringe parties , and this year some have been formed with the specific purpose of sabotaging @entity22 ’s @entity3 by confusing voters			1
three have been set up by former @entity3 members who quit the party in protest at @entity22 ’s style of leadership			1
in the @entity46 , former @entity3 mep @entity44 – who quit the party in 2010 – has set up the @entity47			2
standing in the same region is the socialist dinosaur @entity50 , a former @entity51 mp who was ejected from the party in the 1990s because of links with the far - left @entity54			0
he ’s a candidate for another @entity56 party , @entity55 , which is targeting @entity51 supporters and trade unionists tempted by @entity3			0
another @entity55 candidate is @entity60 , general secretary of the @entity61 of @entity27			0
alongside him is the daughter of rail union firebrand @entity63 , who died recently			0
@entity65 says she ’s standing not only in her father ’s memory , but because she believes ‘ the kind of socialism he worked so hard for can not be built until we withdraw from the @entity73 empire ’			0
in the @entity74 , @entity3 is being challenged by @entity75 , also set up by a disaffected member			2
@entity22 fears that potential voters , especially older ones who might already be perplexed by the ballot paper , will see other @entity56 parties ' names and wrongly vote for them instead of for @entity3 arguably the biggest threat to @entity3 is from the @entity85 party which was set up last year by former @entity3 mep @entity86			1
@entity87 , he ensured it comes close to the top of the ballot paper ( which lists parties in alphabetical order ) by including the word ‘ an ’			1
this system means that the main parties – @entity51 , @entity95 , @entity96 – are buried further down			0
@entity22 ’s @entity3 is right at the bottom of the list			1
not surprisingly , @entity22 fears that potential voters , especially older ones who might already be perplexed by the ballot paper , will see other @entity56 parties ’ names and wrongly vote for them instead of for @entity3			1
the clutch of fringe parties are drawn to the @entity6 elections in @entity27 because , unlike general elections and by - elections , which use the first - past - the - post method , candidates are selected via a proportional representation system which favours smaller parties			1
indeed , the way @entity112 are elected is just as complicated as the ballot paper			2
critics of the @entity26 poll also argue that the selection system is undemocratic because you ca n’t choose an individual candidate you want to be your @entity86 – only a party – and thus it cuts the important link between electors and candidates			2
among those who appear to have little hope of being elected is the @entity124 founded by @entity125 , a @entity126 from @entity127 who ’s now a @entity128 bus driver			0
then there ’s candidate number six standing for the @entity131			0
she is rock chick @entity133 , ex-wife of @entity135 musician @entity134			0
which says it all really .			0
