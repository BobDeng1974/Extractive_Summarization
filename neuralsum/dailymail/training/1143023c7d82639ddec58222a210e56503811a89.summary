tests on fluids from @entity3 's body revealed ' unexplained ' higher levels of polonium 210 former @entity8 leader @entity3 may have been poisoned to death with radioactive polonium , scientists in @entity7 have revealed			1
@entity3 died in @entity11 on november 11 , 2004 , at the age of 75 , but at the time doctors were unable to specify the cause of death			1
experts revealed that several belongings and items of clothing belonging to @entity3 , including his toothbrush , hat and underwear , contained high ' unexplained levels ' of the radioactive material			1
the material is the same as that used to murder former @entity29 spy @entity28 in @entity30 in 2006			0
@entity3 , who died after falling ill at his headquarters in the @entity32 , showed symptoms of nausea , stomach pain and kidney and liver failure - signs consistent with radiation poisoning			2
but the lack of hair loss or a shortage of bone marrow casts doubt on that theory , the scientists admit			0
much rumour had surrounded @entity3 's death after doctors could n't identify how he died			1
suggestions ranged from the aspersion that he had died from @entity51 to claims that rivals had poisoned him			0
speculation continued unabated when his widow @entity55 initially refused a post-mortem examination on her husband 's body			1
but she changed her mind and asked judges in @entity11 last year to launch a murder probe into her husband 's death , claiming he was poisoned because he was an ' obstacle to peace '			2
experts at @entity68 's @entity67 have now released details of the tests which ' support the possibility ' he did not die of natural causes			1
the tests were ordered by @entity3 's widow @entity55 ( pictured together ) , who believes her husband was killed because he was ' an obstacle to peace ' a statement said : ' several tests on samples of bodily fluids contained an unexplained higher level of polonium 210 , compared to control samples			1
' these findings support the possibility of @entity3 's poisoning with polonium 210			1
' they examined 37 items of @entity3 's clothing and compared levels of polonium with a similar number of uncontaminated items			1
computer projections , which estimate the speed at which the radioactive material breaks down , suggested that the levels of polonium 210 would have been consistent with a ' lethal ingestion ' in 2004			1
the team , whose findings are published in @entity106 medical journal @entity107 this week , said they regretted that no post-mortem investigation was carried out after @entity3 's death			1
@entity110 breaks down quickly in the human body and is difficult to trace if there is a delay			0
remembered : @entity3 remains a @entity8 national hero and his tomb is still a site of political pilgrimage the researchers added : ' an autopsy would have been useful in this case because although potential polonium poisoning might not have been identified during that procedure , body samples could have been kept and tested afterwards			2
' mrs @entity55 's lawyer @entity124 told the @entity11 media last year : ' @entity55 hopes that the authorities will be able to establish the exact circumstances of her husband 's death and uncover the truth , so that justice can be done			1
' she and her family want the truth and nothing but the truth			0
there is no question of any ideological or political exploitation			0
' mrs @entity55 also told @entity140 tv channel @entity139 in july 2012 that both the @entity141 and @entity142 had regarded her husband as ' an obstacle to peace '			2
she added : ' i want the world to know the truth about the assassination of @entity3			2
' @entity3 had been confined by @entity142 to his headquarters in @entity151 when he fell ill in october 2004			2
he was then given permission to be taken to the @entity154 military hospital near @entity155 , telling aides before he left : ' @entity157 willing , i will be back			0
' but less than a month after arriving , he slipped into a coma and died on november 11 , 2004			0
doctors who treated him said at the time he may have died of a blood clotting disorder and ruled out poisoning			0
@entity11 daily @entity163 reported at the time that it had ' very good sources ' who had revealed he died of a condition called disseminated intravascular coagulation ( @entity168 )			2
it described the condition as ' the complete disruption of the mechanisms which normally assure proper blood clotting and can lead to major internal bleeding and possible death '			0
the paper quoted one doctor as saying : ' we also worked on the question of poisoning , using sophisticated techniques , before concluding with a negative			0
' while @entity8 say that any evidence that @entity3 was poisoned would suggest that @entity142 was somehow involved , an @entity142 @entity182 spokesman has rubbished those suggestions			0
polonium - 210 was used to kill former @entity29 spy @entity186 in @entity30 in 2006 @entity186 , a 44 - year - old @entity187 officer who had defected from @entity29 to the @entity106 in 2000 , was killed by polonium 210 in 2006 in @entity30			1
he had been admitted to hospital with severe abdominal pains a month before his death , which were initially diagnosed as caused by thallium , a toxin used in @entity29 rat poison			0
since thallium was supposedly a favourite poison of the @entity198 in the @entity200 era and @entity186 was an outspoken critic of @entity29 president @entity201 , it was initially believed @entity186 might have been the victim of the @entity202 , the @entity29 security service that took over from the @entity198			1
he died in november 2006 , leaving behind a deathbed statement accusing @entity201 of orchestrating his murder			0
but hours before his death medical tests revealed that the fatal poison was not thallium but polonium - 210 , a critical component in the making of early - stage nuclear bombs			1
a russian secret service agent was blamed in @entity212 reports for the poisoning as he had met with @entity186 at a @entity30 hotel just before he fell ill. it was alleged that the agent had slipped the polonium into @entity186 â€™s tea			2
but it later emerged that traces of the isotope were found at a sushi bar that @entity186 had visited before meeting the agent			0
the mystery surrounding his death remains and his murder has never been solved .			0

the tests on @entity3 's bodily fluids were ordered by his widow @entity55
experts at @entity68 's @entity67 say results ' support the possibility ' he did not die of natural causes
tests on samples showed ' unexplained higher level of polonium 210 '
poison was same one used to kill former @entity198 spy @entity186
@entity3 died in @entity11 in 2004 but doctors not able to give cause of death
