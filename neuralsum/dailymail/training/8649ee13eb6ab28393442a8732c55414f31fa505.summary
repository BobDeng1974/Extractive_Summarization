rangers are set to make moves aimed at dispensing with @entity2 as manager after monday ’s annual general meeting at @entity5			1
an announcement is expected to be made of @entity8 ’s intent to underwrite the new £ 8million share issue , approval for which must be granted by shareholders in order to keep the club operating beyond the end of next month			2
with that availability of fresh funding and newly - appointed chief executive @entity18 at the controls , @entity8 and his lieutenant can begin to impress their stamp on @entity0			1
and the @entity34 owner could be painted as the stricken club ’s saviour if loans of up to £ 3m already handed to @entity0 by him were to be written off			1
all of which could mean yesterday ’s 2 - 0 victory over @entity25 becoming one of @entity2 ’s last , if not his final game , in charge of @entity0			1
following a midweek meeting with football board chairman @entity45 and @entity18 , @entity2 remained as manager for the @entity48 game at @entity5			2
but , if bolstered by a guarantee of cash , @entity0 can tackle negotiations over the terms of @entity2 ’s notice period within the next fortnight in a bid to reach a settlement			1
attention would then turn to his backroom staff , including assistant manager @entity59 , first - team coach @entity60 and goalkeeping coach @entity61 , as work begins on establishing a new football structure			0
that would be preferable to the new men in charge than prolonging the agony of @entity2 remaining in control of the squad until as long as next december			0
@entity70 remains a prominent contender to replace @entity2 in the hotseat			0
@entity8 is keen to impress his stamp upon @entity0 as soon as possible those manoeuvres will raise the stakes in @entity0 ’ imminent disciplinary clash with the @entity77			0
last monday , the governing body issued @entity8 and the club notices of complaint for allegedly breaching rules related to his increasing influence in @entity0 ’ day - to - day running			1
@entity8 steered clear three months ago when then chief executive @entity84 went to the market and raised an emergency £ 3million			0
instead , the @entity34 supremo struck a deal with @entity89 for their investment in order to strengthen his shareholding to 8.92 per cent			0
however , he will ensure his shareholding is no more than 29.9 per cent following any flotation , otherwise he would be legally - bound to make a bid to buy the entire company			0
meanwhile , it has emerged @entity99 was advised by formerteam - mates to be careful about courting a relationship with the @entity45 brothers , @entity103 and @entity104 — he sat beside them at the recent games at @entity106 and @entity107 — months before this week ’s revelation of his fall - out with @entity2			2
@entity99 had phoned @entity110 and tried to speak to one current player in a bid to extract information about @entity2 ’s coaching methods			0
the @entity0 manager blanked attempts by @entity99 in midweek to mend the broken relationship , furious that his old team - mate appears to have joined the boardroom camp of those who are opponents of the @entity2 tenure .			1
