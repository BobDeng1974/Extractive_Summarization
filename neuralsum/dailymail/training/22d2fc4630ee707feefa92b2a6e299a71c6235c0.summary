success : hand guns , pictured , were left by their owners in a trash bin at the @entity1 gun buyback on wednesday assault weapons : police collected a range of weapons including assault rifles , hand guns and shot guns ' it 's very quick and painless			1
' handguns , rifles and shotguns were swapped for $ 100 @entity107 gift cards while assault weapons earned a $ 200 card			1

process : when drivers pulled up the unloaded weapons would be removed from their trunks by gun inspectors before they were taken away and a gift card presented in exchange worth : a police officer inspects one of the guns where automatic weapons would receive a $ 200 grocery store gift card and shotguns , handguns and rifles $ 100 gift cards ' to turn in some ammunition , and guns that may be stolen from our house and you know someone may do something really bad with them , ' she told @entity89 of her reasoning			1
' that 's why i 'm turning them in			0
' in 2004 , a report by the @entity202 , however , argued that such exchanges were ineffective in the fight against gun violence			0
