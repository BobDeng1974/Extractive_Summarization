‘ i heard the roof tiles coming down and hitting the floor and saw a kayak from two doors down come flying over the fence and land in our pond			1
it all happened so quickly , and the next thing you know there is a rainbow			2
‘ the worst thing about it is that after 17 years we had almost finished the garden			1

you panic as the noise is so frightening			0
’ her husband , @entity125 , 61 added : ‘ the trees looked like they were literally being torn out of the ground by the force of the wind ‘ a metal pole my wife uses for the washing line was ripped out of the ground and then span around and around the garden like it was in a washing machine , before being dropped to the ground			1
‘ then i heard an almighty bang			0
i went and looked outside and discovered our caravan had been blown over and smashed into a neighbour ’s tree			1
my shed was completely gone and my motorbike was also damaged			1
’ @entity108 looks out of the ruined window of her caravan which was flipped on to its side by the huge winds the winds were so strong they demolished the garden wall at @entity43 's home			1
