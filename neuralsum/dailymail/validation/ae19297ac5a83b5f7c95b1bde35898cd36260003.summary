no - one enjoys filing their tax return , but paying your duty would have been an even more arduous task 2,000 years ago			1
a recently translated ancient @entity7 tax receipt has revealed that it probably took more than 220lbs ( 100kg ) of coins to settle just one wealthy person 's bill			1
the tax receipt was written in @entity12 on a piece of pottery that is said to date back to 22 july 98 bc. a recently translated ancient @entity7 tax receipt ( pictured ) has revealed that it provably took more than 220lbs ( 100kg ) of coins to settle one wealthy person 's bill			1
although it is difficult to calculate what it would have been worth in modern - day terms , estimates place it in the region of $ 1,670 ( £ 1,120 ) the person , whose name is unreadable , paid a land transfer tax of 75 talents , which was a unit of currency , as well as a fee of 15 talents on top , reports @entity34			1
the pottery receipt shows that the tax was paid in coins , which were hauled to a bank in the city of @entity40 , also known as @entity41 or @entity42			1
@entity43 , a phd student at @entity44 in @entity45 who translated the text , said that the bill was ‘ incredibly large ’			0
as paper money did n’t exist and there were no coins as large as one talent , the payees of the bill would have had to make up the sum using drachmas , where 6,000 of the coins equalled one talent			2
a stock image of a silver drachma dating to the 3rd century @entity59 is shown it may seem incredible that such a rigid tax system continued to function at a time of political infighting			0
politics were deadly in @entity65			0
pharaoh @entity66 , who was part of a dynasty of pharaohs who ruled @entity7 after the death of @entity72 , had fought against his brother for the throne and some sources say he killed his own mother to keep a firm grip on power			1
despite his best efforts , in @entity80 his army mutinied and he was killed the following year , leaving his brother to take over the running of the region			0
as paper money did n’t exist and there were no coins as large as one talent , the payees of the bill would have had to make up the sum using drachmas , where 6,000 of the coins equalled one talent			2
consequently , 540,000 drachma were needed to settle the tax bill written on the receipt			1
although it is difficult to calculate what this would have been worth in modern - day money , estimates suggest it would have been around $ 1,670 ( £ 1,120 )			1
@entity102 , an expert in @entity7 coins , explained that the highest denomination coin was probably worth just 40 drachma , so 13,500 of them would have been needed to pay the bill			1
‘ the coins in question weigh , on average , 8 grams ( 0.3 ounces ) , so the total payment of 90 talents probably had a weight in excess of 100 kilograms ( 220 lbs ) , ’ she said			2
the people charged with collecting the money , known as tax farmers , would have had to ring the heavy load to the bank , and it may have been placed in baskets and carried by donkeys			2
dr @entity102 said the surcharge , known as the ‘ allage ’ , may have been added to the bill because part of it was paid in bronze coins , instead of silver			1
the pottery receipt shows that the tax was paid in coins , which were hauled to a bank in the city of @entity40 , also known as @entity41 or @entity42			1
this stock image shows @entity135 in @entity41 ancient texts uncovered in @entity7 village @entity137 ( @entity138 temple pictured ) suggest @entity140 workers had state - supported health care ancient texts recently uncovered among the human remains of an @entity7 village suggest workers from the @entity140 also had their own version of a state - supported health care			1
this scheme , which involved paid sick leave and on - site doctors , made sure workers making the king ’s tomb 3,600 years ago were productive and well looked after			0
the dig of the ancient @entity7 worker ’s village at @entity137 is being led by @entity157 archaeologist @entity156			0
the village was built for workmen who made the royal tombs during the @entity140 ( 1550 to 1070 @entity59 )			0
during this period , kings were buried in the @entity163 in a series of rock - cut tombs			0
the village was purposely built close enough to the royal tomb to make sure the workers could hike there on a weekly basis			0
‘ these workmen were not what we normally picture when we think about the men who built and decorated ancient @entity7 royal tombs - they were highly skilled craftsmen , ’ said dr @entity171			2
‘ the workmen at @entity137 were given a variety of amenities afforded only to those with the craftsmanship and knowledge necessary to work on something as important as the royal tomb			0
’ according to ancient texts found on the site , as well as other historical accounts , the @entity7 state paid workers monthly wages in the form of grain and provided them with housing and servants to help with laundry , grinding grain and porting water			2
ancient texts found among human remains ( pictured with lead archaeologist @entity156 ) include daily records detailing when and why workers were sick and reveal they were also paid a certain amount of sick leave			0
other papyri describe on - site physicians who would treat the workers as part of their employment			0

tax receipt written in @entity12 on pottery is dated to 22 july , @entity213
