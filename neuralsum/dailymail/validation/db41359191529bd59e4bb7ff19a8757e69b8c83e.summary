marriage equality advocates have slammed an advertisement that aired during @entity4 's @entity3 celebrations on saturday night claiming children from same - sex couples are disadvantaged			1
' with so much coverage and celebration of @entity3 , it 's important to also be thankful for natural relationships - for the mum and the dad , ' the spokeswoman said			0
' without that traditional relationship , natural reproduction would n't be possible			0
it 's very important to celebrate natural couples and those values			0
' his controversial comments came as an advertisement claiming same - sex marriage disadvantaged children aired on tv on saturday night			0
it was organised and paid for by the @entity54 , a group ' disappointed with the one - sided debate ' surrounding the issue			0
the 40 - second spot starts with a mother at a park saying : ' we hear a lot about marriage equality , but what about equality for kids ?

' the first point for us is that marriage equality and same - sex couples having children are two different equations , ' @entity95 @entity94 told @entity102			2
' same - sex couples already can and do have children - marriage equality is not going to change that			2
' if the people behind this video were really thinking of the children , they would support marriage equality so that all kids , including those with same - sex parents , could say their parents are married			1
' mr @entity94 also said most @entity115 could see through claims that marriage equality disadvantages children , and that most had ' moved on ' from that discussion			1
' they definitely are n't fooling anyone , ' he said			0
' if they want to make that claim , have some evidence to support it			0
' the majority of evidence shows there is no disadvantage to children with same - sex parents , and in fact most are slightly better off than average			0
