@entity1 manager @entity0 has fanned the flames of @entity4 's contract stand - off with @entity5 by insisting he would sell any player who wanted to leave his club			1
@entity4 's commitment to @entity5 is in doubt after he gave a televised interview on wednesday explaining why he has chosen to put talks over a new deal on hold			1
as @entity14 revealed on thursday , @entity1 are interested in the 20 - year - old and have been asked to be kept updated on his future			1
@entity18 are also keen on the @entity20 international			1
@entity4 , pictured in training on thursday , has rejected a new £ 100,000 - a - week deal with @entity5 @entity0 insists that he would sell any of his @entity1 players if they did not want to play for the club @entity5 boss @entity25 is adamant that @entity4 will not be sold in the summer transfer window @entity5 boss @entity25 will play @entity4 at @entity18 in saturday 's @entity28 clash despite the player admitting that he is ' flattered ' by interest from the north @entity32 club			1
@entity25 insists @entity4 is not for sale this summer at any price , despite his reluctance to sign an extension			1
but @entity0 said : ' i do n't like players that do n't want to play for me and my club			2
my opinion is every player has a price			0
' it does n't matter which player			0
if you ask me , for example , do i want @entity48 to leave @entity1 ? no. if he wants to leave and does n't want to work with me , does n't want to play for @entity1 , does he have a price ? i think he has			2
but i also understand the philosophy of managers and clubs who want to keep the players at any price			0
my philosophy is not better than that , it 's just mine			0
' @entity0 and @entity1 are interested in @entity4 and could make a move for him at the end of the season @entity4 will start against @entity18 despite admitting it was ' quite flattering ' to be linked with the @entity64 @entity0 watches @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 ( @entity68 ) in training at @entity70 on friday @entity25 has resisted the temptation to leave out @entity4 on saturday after a turbulent three days following his revelation of the reasons for stalling over a new £ 100,000 - a - week contract			1
@entity4 's remarks about being flattered by @entity18 's interest have only added to suspicions that his representatives are trying to engineer a move to @entity32			1
but @entity25 believes that @entity4 will react ' very strongly ' to the situation and has the right temperament to handle a game that @entity5 need to win to close a six - point gap on @entity18 in the race for a top - four finish			1
' he will play , ' said the @entity5 boss			2
' if it was a different player i would maybe have something to think about			0
but with this kid , since he has come in , trained and worked with me , he has been phenomenal and i expect him to go there and perform at a high level			0
' i think he is a strong character			0
he 's a young boy , still learning , on and off the field , but i do n't think there was anything derogatory to @entity5			2
i know he loves the club and i expect him to perform at a high level			0
' @entity25 says he expects @entity4 to ' perform at a high level ' against @entity18 despite his contract wrangle @entity4 has attracted interest from clubs including @entity18 , @entity103 and @entity104 @entity106 , pictured being challenged by @entity105 , believes @entity4 should remain at @entity107 @entity106 , meanwhile , has warned that leaving @entity107 could see @entity4 end up on the scrapheap at another club , in a similar way that occurred with @entity111 and @entity112 at @entity103			1
the @entity114 pair , who used to play with @entity106 at @entity103 , played just nine @entity28 games between them after moving to the @entity117			2
@entity106 told the @entity118 : ' both @entity111 and @entity112 went to a club where there is big competition and did n't play			0
' if @entity4 left @entity5 he would not be sure to start games			1
make a mistake or do n't score for two games and he will be on the bench			0
he needs to stay here			0
this is the best place for him			0
