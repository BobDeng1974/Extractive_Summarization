@entity1 manager @entity0 insists he is not worried that @entity3 ’s new agent will destabilise the player — even though incendiary comments last week look like they were made with that intention			1
@entity3 was absent injured as @entity8 ’s goal settled this match to give @entity1 a third straight victory			1
but the win came in the wake of @entity3 ’s new agent @entity13 saying @entity3 would never have signed for @entity1 had he been his representative earlier			1
‘ later on , he ’ll play for one of world ’s best teams : @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 or @entity28 , ’ @entity13 said , sparking uncertainty over the future of the 21 - year - old @entity17 , who became @entity1 ’s record signing when moving from @entity20 for £ 28million last summer			1
@entity3 ( left ) has had some big claims made about him by his new agent @entity13 ( right ) @entity0 has dismissed claims suggesting his star striker could leave @entity33 @entity34 have scored just five goals in nine games since the start of february ( 0.55 per game )			1
this is less than a third the rate before that ( 1.68 per game )			0
‘ in the modern game you do n’t get the values of 25 years ago , ’ said @entity0 , implying a decline in standards of behaviour by agents			0
‘ but when you have a player on a long - term contract there is nothing to discuss			0
that is straightforward and clear			0
’ @entity3 signed a five - year contract at @entity33 so will have four years remaining after this summer			2
‘ my focus is that @entity58 keeps on developing , ’ @entity0 said			0
‘ without a doubt we have been the best club for him because he has had his two best seasons that he has had as a professional and we love @entity3			2
agent @entity13 said he would have never sanctioned @entity3 ’s £ 28million move to @entity33 @entity13 hinted that @entity1 are just a stepping stone for @entity3 on his route to the very top ‘ it has been a joy to see him developing , there is going to be a lot of talk when you score goals as a striker , you are going to get the attraction of other teams … if an agent is going to make those comments , then it is normal that you are going to ask about it			1
an agent can say whatever they want and it is down to everyone else to see what is behind it			0
’ @entity0 ’s counterpart , @entity88 , admitted @entity34 ’s chances of @entity92 football next season were all but extinguished by this defeat			2
‘ it ’s not realistic [ now ] to finish in the top four , ’ he said			0

@entity3 ***'s*** agent @entity13 said his client would leave for big club
