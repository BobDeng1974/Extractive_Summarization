the @entity1 soccer team may have been given ' no chance ' of winning the @entity3 by coach @entity4 , but that does n't mean they ca n't enjoy their luxurious @entity7 base - while they can			1
arriving in a @entity7 crippled by strikes , riots and the worst outbreak of dengue fever in a generation on monday , captain @entity8 and his team mates checked into the 5 - star @entity15 under armed guard			2
with the presidential suite at the modernist hotel inspired by the architecture of @entity23 's legendary architect , @entity22 , costing $ 1,460 a night , the @entity18 have spared no expense to make their players comfortable at the world 's biggest party			1
luxurious : the living room of a presidential suite at the @entity15 , the hotel where the @entity1 @entity3 team will stay during the @entity3 which begins on june 12 good job that is too , because the the @entity1 players face an arduous task to make even the final 16 , having been drawn in the so - called ' @entity34 ' along with @entity35 , @entity36 and perennial rivals @entity37			1
far - flung games from the northeastern coast to the humid @entity41 rainforest will force the @entity1 team to fly about 9,000 miles in three round - trip flights between the matches and their base in @entity7			1
the @entity1 soccer team checked into the downtown hotel after arriving on a bus draped with the flag and slogan , ' united by team , driven by passion '			1
with 219 rooms , there is more than enough room to cope with the unprecedented demand for hotels across @entity23 , as the soccer - mad nation prepares to host largest sporting event on @entity61			2
standard : a more modest but nonetheless impressive hotel room more like where the @entity18 players will be based during the @entity3 sophisticated : even the bathrooms at the @entity7 hotel exude a level of class that befits the @entity1 ' 7th consecutive appearance at the @entity3 welcome : the main lobby at the @entity71 has been heavily renovated to match the hotel 's claim to be one of the most chic in modernist @entity7 @entity77 location : the main lobby has a glass canopy that opens up the hotel to downtown @entity7 while the chaotic metropolis of @entity7 's 12 million residents rages outside , the players will be able to relax at the hotel 's famous @entity84 - that has both @entity23 and @entity87 massage therapists , skilled in promoting physical and spiritual well - being			1
all guests are greeted with a fruit bowl and receive a nightly turndown service complete with a square of honey cake and the next day ’s weather report - which will not be needed to predict the staggering heat of the north , where the @entity1 plays all three group games			2
the pool at the hotel appears to be filled with orange @entity101 , but is actually an optical illusion created by the use of tangerine - hued glass tiles according to @entity105			2
food at the hotel is provided by two - star @entity109 chef , @entity108			1
who since november 2009 has presided over the @entity113 restaurant , which serves creative @entity115 - influenced cuisine along with an extensive menu of tapas			2
the dining room , which also has a posh bar , occupies the 23rd floor			0
this is the beautiful 4th - floor @entity84 operated by the renowned @entity87 company @entity122			0
the spa has trained @entity87 and @entity23 staff refined : the master suite at the luxury hotel - the 5 - star base is where the @entity1 hopes the past two years of planning finally comes together on their @entity3 assault modernist : the @entity133 's external structure that soars impressively above the chic neighborhood of @entity135 and bustling @entity136 - but the interior has been radically altered dining : the hotel boasts the @entity113 restaurant , which serves creative @entity115 - influenced cuisine cooked by two - star @entity109 chef , @entity108 optical illusion : the pool at the @entity71 appears to be filled with orange @entity101 @entity109 inspired : the @entity113 restaurant , which serves creative @entity115 - influenced cuisine career high point : @entity1 ' @entity8 arrives at the team hotel in @entity7 , @entity23 , on monday , june 9 , 2014 arrival : @entity8 , captain of the @entity1 men 's national soccer team talks to journalists as he arrives at the @entity155 airport ahead of the @entity3 in @entity7 on june 9 , with his other team mates @entity1 men 's national soccer team players arrive at the @entity155 airport ahead of the @entity3 in @entity7 armed guard : the @entity160 departs on shuttles to their terminal with @entity164 escorts after arriving at @entity165 on june 9 having practiced at @entity169 's @entity168 training center , the players will fly the 1,444 miles to @entity170 to take on 2010 nemesis @entity37 on june 16			1
while the temperatures in @entity7 in june are around 72 degrees with an average humidity of 78 , the climate in @entity170 and @entity173 are very different			0
situated on the @entity179 coast , both relatively modern cities hit highs of 85 degrees in june and the average humidity is 80 percent			0
that is nothing compared to @entity184 , described as a ' bustling frontier outpost of the modern , industrial world on a distant , jungle planet , 1,671 miles from @entity7 '			0
@entity184 is surrounded on three sides by mostly impassible jungle and on the other by rivers : the enormous @entity192 and the almost unimaginably more powerful @entity41			0
realistic : @entity1 head coach @entity4 talks with his assistant coaches in training in @entity195 , before his team jetted to @entity23 on monday massive , 9,000 mile trek : the @entity199 soccer team will travel thousands of miles from @entity7 to their three group games when you step off the plane , even the air can seem other - worldly , a hot , humid blast that feels like steam - so much so that physical effort can be utterly exhausting			1
a local delicacy is the toxic soup , tacacá			0
it is made from the wild cassava root common to the @entity41			0
to eat the wild cassava , you have to squeeze out the juice and boil it , which removes its toxic qualities			0
the result is a yellowish cooking broth packed with nutrients that @entity41 tribes call tucupi			0
@entity221 is hot tucupi with dried shrimp and jambú , a spinach - like green that briefly numbs the tongue			0
just to complete their group , the @entity1 soccer team will have flown 9,000 or so miles over ten days to and from @entity7 taking on @entity37 , @entity36 and the best player in the world , @entity231 and then finally , the might of @entity35			1
final preparations : view of the football field at the @entity169 training centre in @entity7 which will host @entity1 national football team during the @entity238 @entity23 2014 training : view of a gym at the @entity169 training centre in @entity7 which will host @entity1 national football team during the @entity238 @entity23 2014 final training matches : the football field at the @entity169 training centre in @entity7 which will host @entity1 national football team before and during the @entity3 recuperation : view of the hydrotherapy room at the @entity169 training centre in @entity7 media center : view of the press conference room at the @entity169 training centre in @entity7 which will host @entity1 national football team during the @entity238 view of the @entity169 training centre in @entity7 which will host @entity1 national football team during the @entity238 choosing to be based in @entity7 to take advantage of the modern facilities may seem foolish , especially in light of the continuing problems between @entity23 police and striking subway workers			1
they clashed on monday on a station not far from the @entity1 hotel and are threatening to maintain the work stoppage through the @entity3 opening match here this week			1
authorities are deeply worried about the strike because the subway is the main means of transportation for @entity3 fans who will attend thursday 's opening match when @entity23 takes on @entity270			1
riot police firing tear gas forced about 100 striking workers out of the station as the strike threw @entity7 's normally congested traffic into chaos for a fifth day			0
about half of the city 's subway stations were operating , but with greatly diminished service			0
coastal : this is where the @entity3 will kick - off for the @entity1 against @entity37 on june 16 jungle : an aerial view is seen of the @entity286 soccer stadium in @entity184 where the @entity1 will play @entity36 on june 22 final match : an aerial view of the @entity290 soccer stadium is seen in @entity173 , northeastern @entity23 - where the @entity1 will finish off the group matches against @entity35 on june 26 ' this is the way they negotiate , with tear gas and repression , ' said @entity296 , a union leader , as he and others regrouped outside the station after confronting riot police			1
@entity300 , president of the union leading the strike , said as he marched along with workers on a street in central @entity7 that ' we are not interested in ruining the @entity3			2
' ' i love soccer ! i support our national team			2
the point is not to stop the @entity3 , ' he said			2
' we want to resolve this today and all are willing to negotiate			0
' ultimately , the days are long gone when it was a surprise for the @entity1 to reach the @entity3 finals , but for a country used to sporting success they are still some way short of making a major impact on the tournament			1
it remains one of the final sporting frontiers for the @entity1 to conquer although they reached the semi-finals in 1930 and caused one of soccer 's greatest upsets when they beat @entity326 the last time that the @entity3 was held in @entity23 in 1950			1
poverty : this photograph shows the @entity330 phrase ' @entity331 ' ( @entity332 to the neighborhood ) written in large white letters on a green wall in the @entity337 neighborhood of @entity7 - a notorious favela - or @entity23 slum since that inaugural event they have reached the quarter - finals just once , in 2002 , although this will be the @entity1 ' seventh successive appearance in the finals , a consistent run bettered only by @entity23 , @entity347 , @entity348 , @entity35 , @entity349 and @entity350			1
the @entity1 have a solid team with a lot of depth in the midfield and an experienced coach who knows what it takes to win the sport 's ultimate prize			1
they have also recorded confidence - boosting victories against @entity363 opposition since @entity4 took over in 2011 , including @entity35 , @entity347 and world champions @entity349			2
' i look at things always from a positive side			0
we have a young team , a team that is growing			0
we 've built a lot over the past two years , ' @entity4 said			2
' we 've had the most successful year in our history in 2013 , so we 've built the confidence and the belief that we can deal with those challenges			0
we 're going to take it one game at a time , starting with @entity37 who gave us some issues in the recent @entity379			0
if we start off there well , then it builds even more confidence for the next two big ones			0

the @entity1 soccer team landed in @entity23 on monday *morning* and reached the luxury @entity71 @entity133 hotel
hotel boasts $ 1,460 a night presidential suite and restaurant run by two - starred @entity109 chef
no expense spared by @entity18 to give players chance to escape ' @entity34 '
@entity398 coach @entity4 is *pessimistic* about making last 16
has *bemoaned* his team 's huge travel *itinerary* which will see them traverse 9,000 miles in group stage alone
kick - off their @entity3 on june 16 against perennial rivals @entity37
