3d reconstructions of @entity3 's spine show he had a slight deformity that would have barely affected his appearance @entity3 may be the most famous hunchback in history but it appears his deformity was mightily exaggerated by @entity10			1
scans of his skeleton show he only had a slight deformity that would have barely affected his appearance or prowess on the field of battle , say scientists			1
the notorious description by @entity10 of a ‘ hunchback toad ’ , a machiavellian villain suffering a twisted body , a limp and withered arm , was almost certainly an attempt to blacken his reputation , claim experts			1
instead , a 3d reconstruction of the king ’s spine shows 65 to 85 degrees of ‘ scoliosis ’ , or sideways bending of his spine to the right			1
the condition , which would have developed in his early teens , means he was very far from being a hunchback			0
despite having one shoulder slightly higher than the other and a short trunk in comparison with his arms and legs , there is no evidence he walked with a limp			1
the ‘ well balanced curve ’ of his spine could have been concealed by a good tailor and custom - built armour			1
unlike the hunchback depictions seen on stage and screen , his head and neck would have been straight , not tilted to one side			0
dr @entity62 , chairman of the @entity63 , said the recovery of the king ’s skeleton from beneath a @entity68 car park in 2012 gave scientists an unrivalled opportunity to investigate the legend surrounding the last @entity72 of @entity73			0
the ' well balanced curve ' of @entity3 's spine could have been concealed by a tailor and custom - built armour unlike the hunchback depictions seen on stage and screen , his head and neck would have been straight , not tilted to one side			1
pictured is @entity80 performing as @entity3 in a play by the @entity82 in 1984 scientists who carried out scans of the @entity72 's spine found it had a ' well balanced curve '			1
pictured is a 3d reconstruction of @entity3 's spine at different angles the findings showed his deformities had been greatly exaggerated , he said			1
‘ examination of @entity3 ’s remains show that he had a scoliosis , thus confirming that the @entity99 description of a ‘ bunch - backed toad ’ is a complete fabrication - yet more proof that , while the plays are splendid dramas , they are also most certainly fiction not fact ’ he said			1
‘ history tells us that @entity3 was a great warrior			1
‘ clearly , he was little inconvenienced by his spinal problem and accounts of his appearance , written when he was alive , tell that he was ‘ of person and bodily shape comely enough ’ and that he ‘ was the most handsome man in the room after his brother , @entity117 ’ he added			1
for the new study , published in @entity120 medical journal , researchers conducted a detailed analysis of the skeleton ’s spinal column			0
information from computed tomography ( @entity128 ) x-ray scans and a 3d printer were used to create a plastic replica of the spine , which was photographed from 9 different directions			1
the images were combined to produce an interactive picture that could be made accessible on websites			0
@entity3 was born in 1452 in @entity136 @entity3 was born in 1452 at @entity137 in @entity136			2
during the @entity139 , @entity3 's father , @entity140 , @entity141 was killed and in 1470 , @entity3 and his brother @entity117 were exiled when @entity142 , from the rival house of @entity144 , took back the throne			1
@entity142 's reign was short lived and during a battle the following year , @entity117 became king			1
in 1483 , @entity117 died and @entity3 was named as protector of the realm for @entity117 's son and successor , the 12 - year - old @entity153 @entity153 and his brother @entity3 were placed in the @entity155 and after a campaign to condemn the deceased king 's marriage to @entity160 , the princes were declared illegitimate			1
@entity3 took to the throne the following day			2
he was crowned in july and in august that year , the two princes disappeared , rumours spread the king had killed them to remove any threat they may have posed to his reign			0
in 1485 , @entity168 , @entity169 launched an attack on @entity3 on @entity171 in @entity172			2
many of @entity3 's key lieutenants defected and he was killed in battle			1
@entity168 took the throne as @entity168 it has been confirmed that @entity3 had a curvature of the spine , although rumours of a withered arm have n't been verified form the bones found in the @entity68 car park last year			1
last year scientists discovered the king was riddled with roundworm after finding large numbers of the parasite ’s eggs in soil taken from @entity3 ’s pelvic region			1
the find suggests that the king ’s intestines were infected with roundworm during his life			0
information from computed tomography ( @entity128 ) x-ray scans and a 3d printer were used to create a plastic replica of the spine shown from two different angles here the king was killed at the @entity171 in 1485 , ending the @entity139 and the @entity206 dynasty			1
his body was taken to @entity68 by supporters of victorious @entity168 and buried in @entity209 , which is now the site of the council car park			0
pictured are @entity3 's remains scoliosis is the abnormal curvature of the spine to either the left or right			1
in the @entity218 , scoliosis affects 3 or 4 children out of every 1,000			0
it can develop at any age			0
a very pronounced curve in the spine was visible when the body was first uncovered			2
as well as the curve that was visible when the skeleton was excavated , evidence of scoliosis can be seen in many of the individual vertebrae			0
the type of scoliosis was identified by @entity68 as ' idiopathic adolescent onset scoliosis ;			0
the word idiopathic means that the reason for its development is not entirely clear , although there is probably a genetic component			0
researchers believe it is possible that the scoliosis would have been progressive , continuing to get worse as @entity3 got older			2
dr @entity243 , a member of the research team from the division of biological anthropology , @entity247 , said @entity10 ’s famous description came more than 100 years after the king ’s death in 1485			2
he said ‘ @entity10 was writing in @entity251 , wanting to please @entity252 with a version of history that made her look good and @entity3 look bad			1
‘ although the king had a spinal deformity , the play did not get the right one			2
’ dr @entity259 , from the @entity68 ’s @entity260 , who led the research , said ‘ although the scoliosis looks dramatic , it probably did not cause a major physical deformity			2
‘ this is because he had a well - balanced curve			2
the condition would have meant that his trunk was short in comparison to the length of his limbs , and his right shoulder would have been slightly higher than the left , but this could have been disguised by custom - made armour and by having a good tailor			1
@entity3 will be laid to rest at @entity278 ( pictured ) after judges said it was time to give him a ' dignified burial '			2
the site is just streets away from the car park where his remains were found the grave and skeletons of @entity3 are shown here			2
dr @entity259 , from the @entity68 ’s @entity260 , who led the research , said ‘ although the scoliosis looks dramatic , it probably did not cause a major physical deformity ' ‘ a curve of 65 - 85 would not have prevented @entity3 from being an active individual , and there is no evidence that @entity3 had a limp as his curve was well balanced and his leg bones were normal and symmetric			1
’ previous research suggests @entity3 would have been about 5ft 8in tall without his deformity , about average for a medieval man			1
but his condition meant he would have appeared slightly shorter			0
the king was killed at the @entity171 in 1485 , ending the @entity139 and the @entity206 dynasty			0
his body was taken to @entity68 by supporters of victorious @entity168 and buried in @entity209 , which is now the site of the council car park			0
it was announced earlier this week that @entity3 will finally be laid to rest at @entity278 after judges said it was time for the monarch to be given a ' dignified burial '			0
@entity316 was made by jewellery expert @entity317 his body was buried 600 years ago without any pomp and ceremony befitting of a king			0
but now the traditional funeral crown that @entity3 never had , has gone on display in @entity323			0
the golden headpiece was commissioned for the last king of the @entity323 by a leading historian who was involved in the archaeological dig that discovered @entity3 ’s remains beneath a car park in @entity68			2
@entity3 was killed at the @entity171 in 1485 , ending the @entity139 and the @entity206 dynasty			0
his body was taken to @entity68 by supporters of victorious @entity168 and buried in @entity209 , which is now the site of the council car park			0
dr @entity333 commissioned a 15th century - style gold - plated crown in tribute to the late king with white roses and gems			0
the crown was made by medieval jewellery expert @entity317 who was inspired to create the design from historical artefacts such as relics and illustrations relating to the contentious monarch			0
the historian had the idea of commissioning the crown when he was carrying the king ’s remains away from the archaeological site , having been involved in searching for the lost remains of the monarch			0
the funeral crown is now on show at the @entity353 in @entity323 's @entity354 – one of the medieval gateways to @entity323			0
it will go on tour around the @entity218 before playing a part in the king ’s reburial at @entity278 .			0

@entity10 described @entity3 as a ‘ *poisonous* bunch - back ’d toad ’
but study of king 's spine shows deformity was exaggerated by *playwright*
scans showed he had a shoulder higher than the other and a short trunk
curve of his spine could have been hidden by a tailor and custom armour
deformity would have barely affected his appearance or prowess in battle
a plastic replica of @entity3 's spine has been created using a 3d printer
