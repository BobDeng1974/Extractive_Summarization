the garments have a combined retail price of almost £ 60,000 , but the charity shop is selling them for hugely discounted prices			1
customers @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 wait patiently to try on a wedding dress whilst @entity23 tries one on the average original retail price of a dress is £ 600 , but one spectacular gown worth £ 1,500 is up for sale for £ 250			1
and since the dresses went on sale the shop in @entity29 has been swamped by young women			1
the small store has just one fitting room but staff had converted a stock room at the back to make a second			2
they have also brought in extra mirrors for the brides - to - be			0
the generous donor has not been identified but they are believed to be in the trade			2
some of the frocks are ex-display and some are just excess stock			0
@entity47 , an area manager for the @entity48 , said the charity stands to raise over £ 10,000 from the bridal gown bonanza			1

' we are selling the bridesmaid dresses for about £ 60 to £ 70 and the wedding dressed for between £ 150 to £ 250			1
the small store has just one fitting room but staff had converted a stock room at the back to make a second ' we considered sharing the dresses out around our other stores but thought if brides - to - be are coming to try on dresses they will want as much choice as possible			2
' we have had a fantastic response from the public			0
the phone has n't stopped ringing with people asking how many dresses we have left and asking where we are			2
