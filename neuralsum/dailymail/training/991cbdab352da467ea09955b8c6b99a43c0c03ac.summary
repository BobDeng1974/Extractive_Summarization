by @entity0 published : 06:16 est , 21 august 2012 updated : 10:19 est , 21 august 2012 the men who would have defended @entity2 from a @entity4 invasion have famously been depicted as a ragtag bunch of elder - statesmen who would have misfired and floundered as they fought			2
but it appears the real truth about the @entity9 is very different , and this @entity10 was very much a @entity11 during the @entity12			1
new documents released by the @entity14 today give us the most detailed picture ever of who joined the world famous volunteer force between 1940 and 1945			1
by sifting through application forms and using a representative sample of these people , experts have found that half of these four million or so @entity2 soldiers were under 27 , and a third were under 18			1
@entity10 ? forget it , new @entity14 documents show around half of volunteers were in their twenties and a third were under 18 @entity10 , regarded as one of the @entity32 's great sitcoms , was led by people like fastidious old bank manager @entity34 and the doddering panic - stricken butcher @entity35			1
it was based on the premise that the @entity9 was made up of people too old to enlist , unless you were a ' stupid boy ' like @entity39 , but today this has been almost completely debunked			1
as well as age details , archived pictures of @entity43 exercises , volunteer posters and some application forms have also been released			1
spot the difference : the @entity9 was much more like this troop of young men pictured in 1941 there is even a signed certificate thanking volunteers for their bravery from @entity54			1
' this surprising discovery , revealed by our pilot project , has destroyed the myth that @entity9 volunteers were primarily formed of those too old to serve in the military , ' @entity55 , principal military records specialist at @entity56 said			1
' perception of the @entity9 may have been distorted over the years , perhaps influenced by the popular tv comedy @entity10 , but now for the first time we have access to primary source material and a more realistic demographic analysis of the @entity9 has been revealed			1
' the @entity32 produced 80 episodes and three specials of @entity10 between 1968 and 1977 , portraying the accident - prone , disorganised platoon which protected the fictional @entity76 resort of @entity77			2
at its peak , as many as 18.5million viewers tuned in to watch the latest mishaps of @entity34 , @entity82 , @entity35 and @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86			1
classic episodes include @entity88 , in which the platoon is offered weapons by @entity91			2
captain @entity34 agrees - before discovering the weapons are muskets and his men are expected to fight on horseback			1
in the @entity96 , the platoon is ordered to split into two sections in the event of an invasion			2
during exercises , the men scramble to their positions , but begin attacking each other in the confusion			2
mission : this archived image shows a group of @entity9 troops practicing with explosives in the @entity111 countryside on patrol : millions of men volunteered to protect @entity2 and it appears that many more were younger than first thought royal seal of approval : this is a signed thank you from the @entity54 , @entity54 to those who gave up their time to volunteer the @entity9 , initially known as the ‘ @entity9 ’ , was an arm of the @entity124 consisting of millions of local volunteers otherwise ineligible for military service , usually owing to age or fitness			1
it was commonly thought to have comprised mostly of men who were too old to serve in military service , yet , @entity56 pilot project has revealed that 50 per cent of the records selected for the project were of men under the age of 27 , with 28 per cent of the men were aged 18 or younger			1
although this revelation is a fascinating discovery from a historical perspective , around half of the records from the pilot still can not be released into the public domain because of data protection and the official secrets act			1
the @entity14 's @entity9 record series contains the enrolment forms for armed service personnel , which were completed when men joined the @entity9			1
these digital records typically contain information such as name , date and place of birth , address , date of enlistment , promotions , previous military service , and date on leaving service			0
the files have been transcribed to allow the records to be searchable by key word , making this initiative a valuable resource to historians online , allowing them to locate key information easily			0
incredible : applications to join the @entity9 also give a fascinating insight into the lives of people , including this one by @entity172 who joined up at 53 veteran : decorated soldier lt col @entity175 , born in 1877 , fought in @entity178 and then signed up to be in the @entity9 , pictured few army service records between 1914 and 1920 exist as many were destroyed by enemy bombing in the @entity12			1
only about 40 per cent survive and the condition of these can vary greatly with some being very badly damaged			0
therefore these new second world war records also shed light on the stories of soldiers who survived @entity178 and joined the @entity9			1
but these men were rewarded for their bravery with medals , rather than causing a string of embarrassing mistakes like those in the celebrated television series			0
one record shows the application of lt col @entity196 , who had previously commanded the 6th @entity197 , the 9th @entity198 , and was colonel of 4th @entity200 in @entity178			1
powerful : many who were not able to join the armed forces volunteered for the @entity9 as they desperately wanted to protect @entity2 in the event of an invasion @entity196 was highly decorated , being awarded the ‘ @entity206 ’ for his previous service in @entity178 , and then later an obe during his time in the @entity9			1
he only served 1 year 130 days in the @entity9 before being discharged due to reaching the age limit of 65			2
sergeant @entity172 enlisted in the @entity9 on 3 june 1940 aged 53			2
his file contains his address and names his next of kin as his wife @entity214 and on october 7 1949 he received a @entity215 for his role in the @entity9			2
sgt @entity172 served 4 years and 18 days with the @entity9 before being discharged to join @entity217 aged 57			1
sharpening pencils at both ends to improve efficiency , regularly jumping into forward rolls to avoid dizziness in combat situations and drinking tea to ease the effects of a gas attack - it sounds like an episode of @entity10			0
but to private @entity227 , pictured right , a member of the @entity9 during the dark days when a @entity4 invasion was a very real threat , anything that could help repel the enemy was important			2
aged 31 when the @entity12 broke out and unable to join the @entity10 , he was determined to still do his bit for @entity234			0
his anti-invasion skills were never put to the test , of course			0
but a detailed , handwritten record of his service showed he was more than ready if the @entity239 had ever rolled into his home town of @entity241			0
the documents had been held by private @entity227 's family since his death in 1999 at the age of 91 , but came to light five years ago when they decided to put them up for auction in 2007			2
after studying @entity9 manuals , pictured below , and attending lectures , private @entity227 would write down a guide to which he could always refer			2
under the heading @entity254 and receiving signals , he wrote : ' to make sure signals are correctly received , keep your pencil sharpened at both ends			0
it will then be correctly written down			0
' describing tactics when on patrol , he said : " by night be alert , by day move slowly			0
' we can either walk in an alert , erect manner or for sharpness , roll			0
practise rolling to avoid dizziness			0
' movement by night means silence is golden			0
be careful of silhouetting and avoid skylines			0
on soft ground , place your heels down first			0
' following a lecture on gas in 1942 , he noted the effects included ' gums ache , dentures fall out '			0
he went on : ' if chlorine gas is used , it will smell like bleach and will result in choking and coughing			0
' lie flat and take plenty of internal warmth - like drinking sweet tea			0
' the father - of - one worked as a bread round driver during the war and later became an accountant			0
his wife , @entity294 , died in 1997 , aged 87 .			0

new national archive documents show around half of volunteers were under 27 and a third of them were under 18
experts say that this has ' destroyed the myth ' that the @entity9 was similar to the *bumbling* group led by @entity34
new original application forms are released today , including some from @entity178 veterans
