so one developer with a vast plot of land he 'd earmarked for a cemetery took a business decision that at best could be described as hasty at worst downright macabre			0
he installed row upon row of marble headstones and on them engraved the names of people - still living - in the village nearby			0
macabre advertising : a @entity21 entrepreneur has filled a cemetery with gravestones with the names of still - living residents of a nearby village in the hope of drawing in new business one foot in the grave ? locals call the cemetery the ' @entity32 ' after the developer took local residents ' names without their consent one local said : ' the more affluent @entity21 people become in this life , the more they are concerned with their final resting place on their journey into the next one			1
' running a graveyard in @entity21 is now a serious moneymaker			0
' what this guy did was seize the opportunity to showcase his plots with all these fake graves			0
' a grave slot in the @entity32 costs as much as £ 10,000 and there is no shortage of takers			1
resting place : two men sit and talk next to the fake graves - it is unclear whether they are sat next to the headstones that bear their names more to come : workmen prepare the ground for the installation of more fake graves at the site but the local authorities are perplexed at the advertising methods employed by the owner			1
one official said : ' it is hardly fair to steal peoples ’ names and then put them on to gravestones			0
' we think he has acted illegally but we are still checking the small print of local statutes			2
' it could well be that he is charged with fraud			2
' advertising space : row upon row of graves line the cemetery which the property developer has only just bought drumming up business : the entrance to the ' @entity32 ' which sits in a village on the outskirts of @entity87			1

villagers in @entity90 near @entity87 are calling the site the ' @entity32 '
local authorities say that the businessman could be charged with fraud
