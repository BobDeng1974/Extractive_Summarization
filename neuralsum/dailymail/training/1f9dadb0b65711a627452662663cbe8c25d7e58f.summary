' perhaps even more important to her role in @entity5 's sexual abuse ring , @entity224 had direct connections to other powerful individuals with whom she could connect @entity5 , ' the suit says			2
' for instance , one such powerful individual @entity5 forced @entity178 # 3 to have sexual relations with was a member of the @entity233 , prince @entity0 ( a / k / a @entity0 )			0
' @entity178 # 3 was forced to have sexual relations with this prince when she was a minor in three separate geographical locations : in @entity176 ( at @entity223 's apartment ) , in @entity159 , and on @entity5 's private island in the @entity240 ( in an orgy with numerous other under - aged girls ) , ' the suit continues			1
