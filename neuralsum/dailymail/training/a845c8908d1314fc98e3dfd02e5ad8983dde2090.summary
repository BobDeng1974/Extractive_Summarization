@entity2 's former @entity1 ref says there is no campaign against @entity5 at @entity5 ’s training ground on friday lunchtime there was an empty space in the area usually reserved for @entity12 ’s sponsored @entity11			1
instead his assistant first team coach @entity13 was the back seat driver after @entity5 ’s manager pulled out of his pre-match briefing because he is upset with the @entity18 over his latest misconduct charge			1
@entity13 proved more than capable , occasionally steering towards controversy with some strident views on ‘ the campaign ’ , the mood around the @entity5 camp and the delicate issue of @entity26			1
this , even by @entity5 ’s standards , was spiky stuff			1
@entity5 players go through their stretches as @entity12 jokes around with his team during training on friday @entity12 was seen looking happy at @entity5 's @entity35 training ground but he sent @entity13 to the pre-match press conference the @entity5 squad laugh as @entity12 instructs his players during a stretching session @entity12 ( right ) looks on in training as @entity5 prepare to host @entity41 at @entity42 on saturday ‘ there is a frustration among all of us , not just @entity12 , because of an accumulation of events which surfaced at the @entity51 game with @entity52 , ’ @entity13 said in the minutes after he finished off the final training session ahead of today ’s clash with @entity41			1
‘ with @entity52 , if they do n’t want to give a pen , that ’s a mistake , but to book him really compounds that pain			1
‘ first you ’re saying it ’s cheating and second he misses a game at some point			1
bookings ca n’t be rescinded			2
that was a really painful day for us , hence the strength of feeling in the group			2
‘ we do n’t really do draws			2
the objective is to win and if we do n’t then the mood is always different			2
‘ people do n’t walk around laughing or joking			2
the mood is up and down depending on the result			2
’ safe to say , then , that the @entity71 is in a bad place after the @entity18 rapped his knuckles because of his demand for strong refereeing at @entity77 and subsequently charged him for his comments directed at @entity79 after the @entity51 game			1
@entity5 's @entity81 ( centre ) attempts to play a pass in front of fellow striker @entity85 during training @entity87 attempts to take on @entity81 and @entity85 as well as @entity88 ( right ) during friday 's training session @entity52 ( left ) and @entity91 battle for the ball as @entity5 bid to avenge their december defeat by @entity41 on saturday @entity52 looks on as @entity94 ( left ) and @entity95 ( right ) attempt to play the ball during a training drill @entity12 took friday training but skipped his pre-match press conference following his misconduct charge by the @entity18 assistant @entity13 instead addressed the media where he backed @entity12 's claim in that there is a campaign against the @entity106 in the absence of @entity12 , it was left to @entity13 to move the subject on to @entity87 and some of the more enthusiastic challenges carried out by defenders in the @entity1			1
there are , in support of @entity13 ’s argument , various pictures of @entity87 ’s socks being cut to ribbons in recent weeks			1
@entity5 ’s assistant head coach added : ‘ with the diving thing , the technology is so good now and you can watch it back five times to highlight someone being in the air a bit longer than he should have done			1
but look at hazard at @entity77			2
if he does n’t see that coming and does n’t get his studs off the ground , that challenge finishes his career			1
‘ if players anticipate challenges they try to get their feet off the ground			2
that makes it a very difficult job for referees			0
‘ but @entity87 just gets on with it			0
he ’s incredible with the stick he takes			0
that is part of it — if he ’s a model pro and gets up straight away after being whacked , that could discourage a referee from taking action against a player who is trying to take him out of the game			1
five minutes later he gets whacked again because the player has n’t got a yellow card			0
it ’s all part of what a player thinks is right or wrong			0
@entity52 goes down in the penalty area after a challenge by @entity51 youngster @entity159 the @entity5 midfielder reacts as referee @entity79 shows him a yellow card during the match at @entity163 's ‘ @entity164 was on the receiving end of a tackle ( by @entity167 ) against @entity168 on the halfway line			1
those two tackles were career - ending tackles if they connect , no doubt			0
yet we spend two or three days talking about how long a player has spent in the air rather than what is done about the perpetrators of those challenges			0
where ’s the logic in that ? ‘ if nothing ’s done , players like @entity87 will not be able to show supporters the ability that he undoubtedly has			0
@entity186 is a very honest , top guy , that ’s for sure			0
i ’m sure he ’s learning to protect himself because you ca n’t rely on anybody else to do it			0
you have to do it yourself			0
’ he was also willing to expand on the complex issue surrounding @entity26 after the clumsy handling of his aborted move to @entity195			0
@entity12 always dodges this one , but @entity13 was happy to put forward his own ideas on the issue			1
he said : ‘ what has occurred now was n’t the original plan , that ’s clear			0
’ @entity164 ( left ) , @entity201 and @entity52 speak to referee @entity79 at the end of the @entity1 encounter @entity12 ( right ) was clearly annoyed and spoke to his support staff after @entity52 was booked for diving against the @entity51 some @entity5 supporters are disgruntled over the situation , and @entity13 added : ‘ i think that would depend from fan to fan , but @entity26 is entitled to make the decision that is best for him and supporters are free to feel the way they do			1
@entity26 was a fantastic player for @entity5 , who will be revered by supporters forever			1
now he is a @entity77 player , a club we are directly challenging with			0
whatever has happened , that ’s the situation			0
‘ he ’s scoring goals and i am not surprised by that because he has always had that ability			0
it ’s a difficult situation			0
‘ by leaving , it ’s activated a part of him that perhaps would n’t have been activated if he ’d stayed here			0
