by @entity0 , @entity1 do n't look now , but the traditional rear view mirror is about to be consigned to the scrap heap			0
@entity4 is ready to replace the mirror with a screen showing footage from a camera mounted on the back of the car			1
the carmaker claims that its redesigned rear view mirror will boost safety because the image seen by the driver will not be obscured by back - seat passengers , headrests , piled - up luggage or dirty rear windscreens			1
futuristic : how the technology will work			0
crucially it will be able to switch back into being a normal mirror it will also allow rear windows to be made smaller – allowing cars to be more streamlined and aerodynamic – which in turn will help cut fuel consumption			2
the ‘ smart mirror ’ with its lcd monitor is housed within the same structure as a conventional rear view mirror			1
however it renders normal visibility obstructions – such as the pillars either side of the window – ‘ a non-issue ’ , a @entity4 spokesman said , adding : ‘ @entity46 visibility from conventional rear view mirrors can be obstructed when there are tall passengers sitting in the rear seats , or when luggage has been stacked high in the rear compartment			1
‘ however with the electronic mirror , rearward visibility is free from obstructions			0
this helps the driver get a much better view of the traffic conditions			0
’ @entity4 ’s @entity53 said : ‘ smart rear view mirrors will give our customers the best possible view – no matter how tall the passengers in the back seat of the car are and no matter how bad the road conditions are			1
backup accidents involving light vehicles cause an average of 210 deaths and 15,000 injuries a year , and victims often are children and the elderly , the @entity62 government said ‘ it also offers the possibility of new and exciting designs because it gives us an alternative to a very wide rear window while preserving good visibility			0
’ the camera works well in rain and snow and at dawn and dusk , and crucially can be switched off to allow the mirror to revert to a conventional reflection if drivers want to check their appearance			1
because despite putting themselves at risk of £ 100 fines as well as penalty points , some 42 per cent of women admit they use rear view mirrors to adjust their make - up			0
the car company says the technology is ready to be rolled out in @entity96 , and will be phased in across the rest of the world in 2015			0
@entity4 also plans to use the mirror in its @entity101 race car in the @entity103 24 - hour race			1
@entity4 ’s race car president @entity104 said : ‘ under the harsh driving conditions in the world of motorsports , retaining a clear view for the race driver is of the utmost importance			2
' the smart rear view mirror will be a powerful tool for our drivers			2
we also have high expectations towards improving the cars ’ aerodynamic design			0

the lcd monitor would take the same shape and form as a *regular* mirror
@entity4 claims it will be safer because it will never be obstructed
it even changes back to a mirror *...* so drivers can check their appearance
