it was supposed to be a picture for a private family album , but a photo of the @entity5 family from @entity6 ended up being seen by millions of people globally after it was used in marketing campaigns by tens of different companies			1
the issue might have gone unnoticed were it not for the fact the image was used by a local politician who was running for office and decide to use it in his own campaign			0
now the @entity19 family are aware of the viral leak but are struggling to have the picture removed from websites around the world			1
fame at last ? the @entity5 family discovered their family photo had been used on websites around the world privacy settings : @entity5 says she and the photographer never submitted the photo to any website or gave them permission to use the photo easy to find : a quick search on imgion.com for ' smiling family ' turns up the @entity5 ' photo surprise : @entity41 first learned about the problem when she was made aware that her family 's photo was on a @entity46 's campaign ad that was mailed to voters ' we had photos online and never thought anything like this would happen , ' @entity41 told @entity52			1
it was only when @entity46 , a candidate for state representative in @entity6 's 130th district , used the picture , that the issue came to light			2
mr @entity46 told mrs @entity41 that he obtained the photo from the free stock photo website imgion.com			1
the part that could n't be explained was that she and the photographer never submitted the photo to the website nor gave them permission to use the picture			2
she believes imgion.com stole the 2009 photo from her blog			2
however , it was n't just @entity46 's campaign that was using the shot of her family and three young children , but tens of other websites on almost every continent			2
without realizing it , the @entity73 's photo has become the face of advertisements selling apps , sunscreen , pet tracking devices , holiday cards , infertility drugs , cameras and vacations			0
@entity88 found more than 30 different websites that contained the family 's photograph around the world including @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99			1
' a lot of the sites are in different languages			0
i do n't know what we 're selling ! ' said @entity106			0
global reach : the family 's photo is on more than 30 websites in countries including @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 family ties : the @entity5 ' are wondering how they can have the photo removed from all the websites mass appeal : the @entity73 's photo has become the face of advertisements selling a host of products from insurance ... ... to family days out and holiday greeting cards now that the photo has gone viral there is not a lot the @entity5 family can do			1
legal experts warn that anyone who uses a photo without the proper rights and permissions from the photo 's owner could face legal consequences , especially if used for profit and commercial purposes			0
however , the threat of legal action may not prove to be much of a deterrent especially to individuals like the @entity5 ' who do n't have the backing of a large organization or legal network			0
there is little that can be done to prevent others from taking pictures once they appear online without going down a long and costly legal road			0
the @entity5 ' may struggle to have each and every one of the pictures that were used of their family taken down			0
many have suggested the best way to prevent your photos from being taken without permission is to not put them online in the first place finding fault : mrs @entity41 believes imgion.com ' stole ' the 2009 photo from her blog and then distributed it viral : @entity5 says she and the photographer never submitted the photo to a stock photo website or gave any permission to use the photo picture this : some of the sites are in different languages and it 's not even clear what they are selling happy families : experts say it is unlikely the family will ever be able to stop their photo being used			1

@entity41 believes that her family photo with her *husband* and three children was stolen from her blog
the picture appears on more than 30 different websites around the world
there is no way the picture can ever be *fully* removed from the internet
