fears the end of the @entity2 calendar predicts the @entity3 this coming december have run rife on the internet in recent years			1
less well known is the rumour that one particular mountain in south - west @entity7 will burst open on that day revealing an alien spaceship which will carry nearby humans to safety			1
well , if you were counting on that possibility to save you from the apocalypse , prepare to be disappointed			1
@entity7 officials have banned access to the @entity16 to avoid a rush of @entity19 fanatics , sightseers and , above all , journalists			1
the @entity16 , south - west @entity7 : online rumours claim that on december 21 the mountain will burst open to reveal an alien spaceship that will rescue those nearby from the apocalypse a hundred police and firefighters will also control approaches to the tiny village of the same name at the foot of the mountain , and if too many people turn up , they will block access there too			1
believers say the world will end on december 21 , 2012 , the end date of the ancient @entity2 calendar , and they see @entity42 as one of a few sacred mountains sheltered from the cataclysm			1
@entity46 , @entity7 's top official in the area , told @entity48 : ' we are expecting a few visionaries , a few people who believe in this end of the world , but in extremely limited numbers			1
' we are expecting greater numbers of people who are just curious , but in numbers we can not determine			0
above all , we are expecting lots of journalists			2
' expectations : with the @entity60 , pictured , ending on or around december 21 some fear it means the people believed it to be the end of the world no - go zone : @entity7 officials have banned access to the @entity16 , in south - west @entity7 , to avoid a rush of @entity19 fanatics films , documentaries and websites have promoted the idea that the ancient @entity2 calendar , which is made up of 394 - year periods called baktuns , predicts that doomsday is on december 21			1
experts estimate the system starts counting at 3114 b.c. , and will have run through 13 baktuns , or 5,125 years , around december 21			1
they say 13 was a significant number for the @entity84 , and the end of that cycle would be a milestone â€” but they have been keen to stress that it does not mark an end			2
conspiracy theorists nonetheless believe the @entity84 may have been privy to impending astronomical disasters that would coincide with 2012 , ranging from explosive storms on the surface of the sun that could knock out power grids to a galactic alignment that could trigger a reversal in @entity99 's magnetic field			0
the culture ministry in @entity101 - where half the population are of @entity2 descent - is hosting a massive event in the capital just in case the world actually does end , while tour groups are promoting doomsday - themed getaways			1
@entity111 's remains : the @entity2 temple at @entity114 , @entity112 is seen where the people 's culture of writing , astronomy and temple complexes flourished from years 300 to 900 but the country 's @entity84 alliance @entity120 accuses the government and tour groups of perpetuating the myth that their calendar foresees the imminent end of the world for monetary gain			1
it issued a statement last month saying that the new @entity84 time cycle simply ' means there will be big changes on the personal , family and community level , so that there is harmony and balance between mankind and nature			0
' in september @entity144 government archaeologist @entity143 said that the @entity84 tried to make predictions , but perhaps about more humdrum events like droughts or disease outbreaks			0
@entity149 plans : arguing @entity2 prophecies beyond 2012 , king of @entity151 , @entity152 , pictured , said he would return to @entity99 a couple thousands years from now in the future ' the @entity155 did make prophecies , but not in a fatalistic sense , but rather about events that , in their cyclical conception of history , could be repeated in the future , ' said @entity143 , of the @entity161			2
experts have stressed that the ancient @entity84 , whose ' classic ' culture of writing , astronomy and temple complexes flourished from the year 300 to 900 , were extremely interested in future events , far beyond dec. 21			2
' there are many ancient @entity84 monuments that discuss events far into the future from now , ' wrote @entity172 , an anthropologist at the @entity173			0
' the ancient @entity84 clearly believed things would happen far into the future from now			0
' ' the king of @entity151 , @entity152 , believed he would return to the @entity99 a couple of thousand years from now in the future , ' dr @entity172 wrote in an email to @entity178			0
' moreover , other monuments discuss events even before the creation in 3114 b.c. ' only a couple of references to the 2012 date equivalency have been found carved in stone at @entity187 , and neither refers to an apocalypse , experts say			2
such apocalyptic visions have been common for more than 1,000 years in @entity192 , @entity191 thinking , and are not native to @entity84 thought			0
' this is thinking that , in truth , has nothing to do with @entity2 culture , ' said @entity197 , an anthropologist at the @entity198 , a state on @entity144 's @entity201 coast			2
' this thing about looking for end - times is not something that comes from @entity2 culture			1
' dr @entity172 compared the @entity84 , with its system of cycles within cycles , to the series of synchronized wheels contained in old , analogue car odometers			0
' the maya long count system is like a car odometer , ' @entity172 wrote			0
' my first car ( odometer ) only had six wheels so it went up to 99,999.9 miles			0
that did n't mean the car would explode after reaching 100,000 miles			0

rumours say the mountain will burst open on december 21 to reveal an alien spaceship which will save those nearby from the apocalypse
@entity7 police will control access to the mountain and village to stop expected hordes of @entity19 fanatics , sightseers and journalists
december 21 is the estimated end of the @entity2 long calendar , which some believes marks the end of the world as we know it
