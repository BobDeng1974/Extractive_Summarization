@entity0 was on the verge of announcing it had its own @entity3 after strange s - shape and loop shape formations were spotted by a weather bureau radar off the west @entity8 coast			1
the unusual images sparked a frenzy of rumour online with some weather groups dubbing the initial 80km - wide formation the @entity15 monster , as it appeared off @entity15			1
@entity16 mounted after a second shape was spotted today , adding to the intrigue			0
giant squiggle : this first weather radar image sparked huge speculation that a mystery creature could be off the coast of @entity15 in western @entity0 the loop - shaped formation added to speculation there was a @entity28 - type creature living off the @entity8 coast however , the mystery was finally resolved this afternoon after the @entity31 revealed that the formation was actually related to the navy testing a ship system in the area			1
' the unusual pattern that appeared on the @entity41 's @entity40 weather radar on wednesday 12 , was the result of a defence exercise off the @entity44 , ' a @entity37 spokesman said ' the exercise is a regular training activity involving ships and aircraft , that is designed to prepare a @entity50 warship for an operational deployment			1
' the environmental conditions over the west @entity8 coast at the time of the activity provided a unique opportunity for this routine activity to be visible on the weather radar display			1
' @entity61 administrator @entity60 , 39 , said he had hoped the formations were a sign of another life form such as a @entity3 - type creature			2
' the explanation totally ruined it - the mystery is over , ' he said			2
' i think if there 's going to be a rumour , let 's give it a name and make it a @entity76 monster			0
it would be great for tourism and could get tours going			0
' mystery creature : online groups had speculated that the squiggles could give @entity15 island its own @entity28 monster mr @entity60 said people had seen navy activity in the area , but he did not believe this caused the formation			1
' the thing that got everybody was how long it lingered on the radar and moved in the wind , ' he said			2
' it was slow moving , it was slower moving than an aircraft dumping fuel but too fast for a helicopter			2
the innuendo going around is not based on science			0
' @entity41 meteorologist @entity103 had said there was no explanation for the giant shape , but used a process of elimination to ruling out some causes			1
' it 's nothing meteorological			2
it 's not a cloud , radars do n't pick up clouds , that 's not what they 're for			0
' he said military chaff had also been ruled out			0
' sometimes military with the chaff can cause different formations , but the fact it maintained its shape as it moved north - west rules that out , ' he said			1
' if it was military - related they did a very good job of flying that signature in a very short period of time , ' he said			0
' it did n't change shape as it moved - caught in the wind it would have changed			0
' @entity61 spokesperson @entity137 , 19 , said the formation had caused confusion among weather enthusiasts			1
' it could be something like a @entity3 , but that would n't show up on a radar , ' he said			0
mr @entity137 has been part of the weather enthusiast group , based in @entity40 , since 2010 and said he had never seen anything like the formation before			1
' that particular shape sparked a lot of interest - it 's a bit unusual , ' he said .			0
