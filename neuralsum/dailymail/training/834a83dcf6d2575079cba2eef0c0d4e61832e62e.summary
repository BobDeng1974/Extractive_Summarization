by @entity1 reporter published : 12:10 est , 4 february 2013 updated : 13:37 est , 4 february 2013 never mind 8 megapixels on your iphone 5 : @entity8 will be rolling out a new flagship phone with a 41 megapixel camera sensor , sources close to the @entity7 company have confirmed			1
the camera technology , dubbed @entity12 , first saw the light of day at the huge @entity15 mobile phone fair , @entity16 , in february last year			1
but the technology was debuted in the last of @entity8 's old range of smartphones , which used the now - defunct @entity21 operating system			1
picture this : the @entity23 is the current flagship model @entity8 's @entity12 technology means that the shutter can be open for longer and getting better pictures in low light conditions since then @entity8 has partnered with @entity28 to launch a range of handsets , the @entity31 , sporting the @entity33 interface			1
when @entity8 and @entity28 launched the latest version of the @entity36 , the 920 , at the end of last year , observers wondered what had happened to the revolutionary technology , as the top of the range handset ' only ' boasted an 8.7 megapixel sensor			1
nowadays everybody carries a very capable camera in their pocket - on their smartphone			2
but cameraphones were first mooted as far back as the 1950s : there are patents dating back to 1956			0
perhaps the first true cameraphone moment came on june 11 1997 when @entity52 shared the first pictures from the maternity ward where his daughter @entity55 was born			0
he wirelessly transmitted his cell phone pictures to more than 2,000 family , friends and associates around the world			2
since then photosharing has exploded via social networks such as @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65			0
the first camera phones , as successfully marketed by @entity67 in @entity68 , used ccd sensors and not cmos sensors			2
now everyone - even @entity74 , the cat with eyebrows - share pictures instantly from their phones			0
now the amazing 41 megapixel sensor will be in the next top of the range @entity78 , which will be dubbed the @entity79			0
but the resulting images will actually only be about 5 megapixels			0
however , they will be very high quality , because the both the pixels and the sensor in the new phone will be bigger than their counterparts made by other technology firms - which means a bigger area for light to be captured on			0
the sensor works by ' oversampling ' : each pixel also takes in information from surplus pixels around it			0
that means that ' noise ' - the coloured flecks that mar the dark areas of photos taken in low light - can be reduced			0
it is difficult for handsets using the @entity33 interface to stand out , as @entity28 defines the hardware specification and design very tightly			0
@entity8 immediately sought to produce the best images possible on a camera phone			1
the current @entity36 and the forthcoming @entity79 , which will launch in the @entity109 next summer , will use what @entity8 calls its ' floating lens technology '			1
this helps stabilise a shaky hand - a gyroscope detects the movement and the entire camera mechanism moves to correct it			1
that means that the shutter can be open for longer , letting more light fall on pixels and reducing the need for flash - which is often very harsh on a camera phone			1
@entity8 would n't confirm the move , only saying : ' while we are delighted with the attention the @entity36 range continues to gather , it has been our long - held policy not to comment on market rumours or speculation			2

new @entity133 phone from @entity8 will be called the *eos* and debut in the summer
camera mechanism *housed* in a cage allowing shaky hands to hold it steady
