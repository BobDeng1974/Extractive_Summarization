@entity0 has bought a satellite firm as the first step in its project to improve its maps and bring the internet to developing countries			1
the $ 500 million acquisition of @entity9 firm @entity8 will initially be used to boost the quality of @entity0 's maps images as it battles @entity12			1
@entity8 has already hit the headlines for capturing the first hd video footage of @entity15 from its tiny satellite - which many dubbed at the time as being ' like live @entity0 maps			1
these satellites would take aerial pictures and provide online access to remote areas of the world			2
this photo of @entity32 , @entity33 was taken by @entity8 on 18 february 2014 @entity34 - 1 , which was launched in november , captured up to 90 - second video clips at 30 frames per second			2
satellites today are capable of taking imagery better than a metre in resolution , but they weigh thousands of kilograms			0
@entity41 is 20 times smaller than traditional satellites			0
the circuitry that drives it is about the size of a phone book and consumes less power than a 100w light bulb			0
the @entity50 group , @entity19 , is now planning a constellation of 24 satellites that will be able to cover almost the entire expanse of the @entity15			2
@entity54 , an identical version of @entity34 - 1 , is scheduled to launch in 2014			0
@entity0 is also believed to be mulling plans to launch its own fleet of satellites to bring the internet to developing countries - a project @entity62 is also pursuing			1
@entity0 plans to use @entity8 's satellite already in orbit to supplement the material that it licenses from more than 1,000 sources , including other satellite companies such as @entity68 and @entity69			1
eventually , though , @entity8 could turn into another @entity0 ' moonshot ' - a term that ceo @entity72 has embraced for describing ambitious projects that could take several years to materialize			1
@entity0 hopes to build more satellites that could be used to beam internet access to points around the world			1
' @entity8 ’s satellites will help keep @entity80 accurate with up - to - date imagery , ' the firm said			1
' over time , we also hope that @entity8 ’s team and technology will be able to help improve internet access and disaster relief — areas @entity0 has long been interested in			1
' that would expand an effort that @entity0 began a year ago when it unveiled " @entity90 " — a venture featuring jellyfish - shaped balloons equipped with antennas to bring the internet to parts of the world without the proper wiring to get online			1
as the owner of the world 's most popular search engine and email service , @entity0 typically benefits when more people are on the @entity94 to see the ads that generate most of the company 's annual revenue of $ 55 billion			2
page and other @entity0 executives say they are primarily interested in getting more people on to the @entity94 to create a more egalitarian and knowledgeable society			0
the expansion into satellites comes two months after @entity0 bought drone maker @entity112 for an undisclosed amount			2
satellites today are capable of taking imagery clearer than a metre in resolution , but they weigh thousands of kilograms			0
@entity41 is 20 times smaller than traditional satellites			0
shown here is a view of @entity121 @entity0 made about 250 acquisitions during the past decade , using many of them to expand into new markets , including maps and mobile devices			2
to the frustration of some investors , @entity0 also has been spending billions of dollars exploring new frontiers of technology , including driverless cars , @entity94 - connected headwear , robots and a startup called @entity136 striving to find ways to slow the aging process			2
other investors have applauded @entity0 for having the vision and audacity to make big bets on bold ideas that analysts say could hatch lucrative products in the rapidly changing technology industry			0
@entity0 's most - widely traded class of stock dipped $ 2.81 to $ 567.92 in tuesday 's afternoon trading			1
@entity8 is a 5 - year - old startup in @entity151 , @entity9 , located a mile - and - half from @entity0 's headquarters in the same @entity154 city			1
a mine in @entity156 captured using the @entity8 satellite			0
led by aerospace industry veteran @entity158 , @entity8 has been working on additional satellites that should be easier to complete with @entity0 's backing @entity8 develops small , relatively cheap satellites			1
traditional satellites capable of taking imagery at better than 1 meter resolution weigh thousands of kilograms , which makes it prohibitively expensive to launch enough of them to capture timely imagery			2
the firm says it has produced similar performance in a box 20x smaller			0
' the circuitry that drives our satellites - providing power , attitude control , communications , thermal management , and imaging support - are about the size of a phone book and consume less power than a 100w light bulb , ' it says			0
' we 've integrated the latest , greatest , and fastest commercially available @entity183 , processors , and memory to ensure our small satellites pack the largest possible punch			1
' the newly released images also show @entity189 in @entity190 , with boats clearly visible in the harbour			0
the @entity193 was collected by @entity34 - 1 on february 14 , 2014 led by aerospace industry veteran @entity158 , @entity8 has been working on additional satellites that should be easier to complete with @entity0 's backing			1
' the time is right to join a company who can challenge us to think even bigger and bolder , and who can support us in accelerating our ambitious vision , ' @entity8 said in a blog post			0
@entity8 had previously raised about $ 91 million in venture capital			0
the company says it employs about 100 people			0
@entity0 is hoping to gain regulatory approval to take control of @entity19 within the next few months .			0

@entity9 firm @entity8 will be used to boost the quality of @entity0 's maps
creates low cost , small satellites that can capture images and video
firm can capture live hd video of @entity15 where planes and cars can be seen moving
@entity0 *expected* to launch fleet of satellites to bring internet access to developing countries
