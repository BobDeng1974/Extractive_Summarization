@entity0 is facing the fourth claim of sexual harassment against him in the space of a week after a former male massage therapist at the @entity5 claimed the ' @entity7 ' star was banned for lewd conduct a masseur at the posh @entity5 in @entity10 has claimed that @entity0 was blacklisted for three years from the hotel 's spa for inappropriate behaviour			1
former @entity5 masseur @entity14 said that @entity0 always asked for a man for his massage at the hotel 's famous rooftop spa and was barred after several creepy - run ins			1
@entity14 , 55 , said that male staffers complained that the ' @entity7 ' star would grind against the massage table , remove the towel and lift his butt in the air during his therapy			2
' @entity0 would always request a man for his massage , but after a while no one would take him because of his inappropriate behavior , ' said @entity14			1
' it got to the point where they could n’t find any men to take him , and they had to ban him , ' explained the masseur known as @entity36 , who said he worked at the @entity5 from 1992 - 2008			1
the ban lasted for three years and happened around a decade ago according to @entity14 , who now works from his @entity38 , @entity40 home offering massages for $ 100 an hour			2
' if he was banned , do you think he ’d ever go back ? ” said @entity0 ’s attorney , @entity43 , dismissing the allegation as complete nonsense — noting that his client was at the hotel ’s famous rooftop spa as recently as six months ago			1
' he ’s never been banned , i guarantee you			0
. the hotel never told @entity0 he was banned , and @entity0 never acted improperly , ' according to the @entity50			2

@entity68 has apparently had second thoughts about representing the man who now claims he was mistaken about the date of the alleged attack			0
he called the date mix up a ' miscalculation ' and still insists the assault allegedly happened a few days prior			0
the @entity76 had claimed that @entity0 made sexual advances towards him on january 16 2012 and could prove the @entity79 star was in @entity80 at the time			2
but the a-list star 's attorney @entity43 has produced photographs and a restaurant bill to show that @entity0 was in @entity40 at the time and strongly denies the lurid allegations			1
' @entity68 did not feel he could represent @entity63 # 1 going forward anymore and recommend him finding another lawyer , ' a source told @entity90			2
' he is still representing @entity63 # 2 and other alleged victims who are possibly coming forward			0
' meanwhile , @entity0 was hit by fresh sexual harassment claims earlier this week after another man came forward			2

' he hugged me and asked me to do a massage			0
' @entity40 dining : a receipt from a meal the @entity7 actor ate at mr. @entity125 in @entity40 on the same day has also emerged reports suggest @entity94 has filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against @entity0 - although this has yet to be verified			1
the news comes following claims from two unidentified masseurs alleging @entity0 sexually assaulted them			1
they are suing for $ 2m in damages			0
@entity0 's lawyer , @entity43 has strenuously denied the two initial claims and is yet to comment on the latest allegations			1
the first two masseurs to come forward have been named as @entity63 # 1 and @entity63 # 2 in @entity139 lawsuits			1
both are being represented by lawyer @entity68 and claim the @entity79 actor made sexually advances towards them			0
yesterday @entity0 's camp put forward photographic evidence which appeared to provide @entity0 with an alibi with regard to claims by @entity63 # 1 , who alleges he was assaulted by the actor on january 16 of this year at a @entity150 hotel in @entity80			1
@entity0 's lawyers , however , claim the actor was in @entity40 on that date - releasing a restaurant receipt from the mr. @entity125 in @entity40 and two photographs of the actor as evidence			1

in a new development today , the @entity50 reports flight records prove @entity0 landed in @entity164 , @entity40 , hours before sunrise on the day @entity63 # 1 claims the alleged sexual harassment took place in @entity80			1

in another bizarre twist the unidentified masseur has released a statement wishing @entity0 ' health and happiness ' - despite pressing ahead with the lawsuit			2
in a statement to @entity90 he said : ' even though mr @entity0 and his counsel are on opposing sides in this matter , i do wish them good health , happiness , and want them to be judged with absolute fairness as our great nation affords all citizens regardless of their wealth or station			0

he told @entity90 : ' by the time this case is over @entity43 [ @entity0 's lawyer ] will have to accuse more than 100 men of lying because i have been contacted by people , mostly men , that have first hand information about similar behaviour on @entity0 's part to that contained in the lawsuits			1
second accuser : court papers were amended when the second masseur claimed sexual battery by the star ' i have already filed against him			0
