by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 the military on wednesday identified 17 of the 52 people onboard a @entity5 that crashed into a mountain outside @entity7 , @entity8 , on nov. 22 , 1952			1
the crash site was rediscovered two years ago , and testing has confirmed the identities of about a third onboard			1
the military says the bodies of the other 35 crewmembers have not yet been recovered			0
identified : @entity16 col. @entity15 is one of 17 bodies from the 1952 wreck that have been positively identified @entity16 col. @entity20 's remains also have been identified as one of the 52 people killed in the wreck lt. col. @entity24 is one of three army men who died in the crash to be identified the @entity5 was the largest transport aircraft when it was introduced into service in 1950 the @entity28 has released names and ranks for the service members , but not hometowns			1
identified by military branch were : from the @entity34 , the @entity28 has identified the bodies of lt. col. @entity24 , pvt. @entity36 , and @entity37			0
@entity38 and @entity40 commander @entity39 also have been identified			0
wreckage : the wreckage was discovered @entity42 , about 50 miles east of @entity7 slow process : recovery teams want the grinding glacier , as it moves over time , to reveal more relics over what is expected to be a years - long project the 12 remaining servicemen were from the @entity16 and have been identified as col. @entity50 , col. @entity15 , capt. @entity52 , 1st lt. @entity53 , 1st lt. @entity54 , tech. sgt. @entity55 , staff sgt. @entity56 , airman 1st @entity57 , airman 2nd @entity59 , airman 2nd @entity60 , airman 2nd @entity62 , and airman 3rd @entity64			1
relics from the plane first emerged last summer on @entity42 , about 50 miles east of @entity7			1
that discovery , by @entity69 crews flying training missions out of @entity7 , put into motion a sophisticated recovery program carried out by the @entity74 - based @entity73			1
@entity76 @entity75 ( left ) and dr. @entity77 , members of a specialized recovery team with the @entity73 assess evidence at a historic aircraft crash site at @entity42 , @entity8 after last year 's initial work - when nearly everything that rose to the glacier 's surface was picked up - the @entity73 team came back this summer to collect additional relics pushed out of the ice since then			1
' as the glacier melts and the glacier moves , more material comes up to the surface , ' dr. @entity89 , the forensic anthropologist who leads the team of specialists examining the crevasse - ridden ice field , told reporters at a news briefing at the time			2
among the personal items collected from the crash site : a tiny fishing kit , a compass , a survival kit , a survival suit , a hockey puck , and a mini-box of @entity109			1
those and other items are being saved for a future memorial , said @entity113 , a historian at @entity7 's @entity114			2
members of a specialized investigative team from the @entity73 wait as a @entity118 helicopter comes in for a landing to transport them back to base @entity77 and his team must tread carefully , skirting deadly crevasses and deep water - filled holes while trying to collect as many items and remains as possible			0
they want the grinding glacier , as it moves over time , to reveal more relics over what is expected to be a years - long project , but they do not want it to carry the items all the way into the terminus lake , where they would likely be lost forever			0
so far , only the lightest pieces have been pushed to the glacier 's surface , and only a small portion of the 154 - foot aircraft has emerged			0
' we do n't have all 52 guys lined up neatly , ready to be located , ' @entity77 said			0
as the glacier melts and the glacier moves , more material comes up to the surface the wrecked cargo plane , a @entity5 , slammed into @entity148 in midwinter , an accident blamed on bad weather			2
although officials knew the site of the crash , remoteness and winter weather made recovery impossible at the time			2
the wreckage was soon buried under snow and gone from sight			0
when finally spotted last year , the debris was 12 miles from the crash site , having been shifted by the glacier			1
the ice has flowed another 275 meters ( 902 feet ) downslope since 2012 , @entity77 said			0
for @entity8 - based military members supporting the @entity73 effort , there is another mission : removing the crash debris that is not useful to the investigation .			0

the @entity5 crashed into a mountain 50 miles from @entity7 in 1952
all of the 52 military men onboard presumably were killed in the wreck
over time , snow and ice accumulated over the wreckage , hiding it from anyone flying over the crash site
after the glacier covering the wreckage began to melt , recovery teams were able to locate the plane in 2012
