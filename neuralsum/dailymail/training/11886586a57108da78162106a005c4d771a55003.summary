by @entity0 published : 12:12 est , 20 september 2013 updated : 06:35 est , 21 september 2013 early humans were able to hunt animals as large as a prehistoric elephant , according to fossils found at an ancient butchery site in @entity6			1
dr @entity7 discovered the remains of an extinct straight - tusked elephant along with a number of flint tools dating back 420,000 years ago in @entity12			1
it is thought the elephant , which was twice the size of today ’s @entity15 variety , died after being hunted for its meat			1
dr @entity7 discovered the remains of an extinct straight - tusked elephant along with a number of flint tools dating back 420,000 years ago in @entity12 , @entity6 the discovery was made during the construction of the @entity22 rail link from the @entity23 to @entity24 in 2003			1
‘ my first thought was " oh no , how do we tell the high speed 1 team that there is more archaeology to be dealt with ? " ’ , dr @entity7 of @entity26 told @entity27			0
‘ the @entity34 moment for me was finding a flint core in amongst the elephant 's rib cage - this confirmed the human association with the elephant			2
’ researchers believe the deposits date to a warm period around 420,000 years ago , called @entity45 interglacial			0
since the excavation , dr @entity7 ( pictured ) has been carrying out a detailed analysis of evidence recovered from the site , including a number of flint tools found it is thought the elephant , which was twice the size of today 's @entity15 variety and up to four times the weight of family car , died after being hunted for its meat how skilled early humans were in hunting is still a matter of hot debate , according to @entity26 ’s dr @entity63			1
prior to the discovery of these flint tools , evidence was largely based on clues about the age and sex of body parts of possible prey animals			1
‘ in this case , we infer the @entity74 was hunted because the half - dozen @entity76 elephant butchery sites known from @entity77 are mostly prime adult males , and we do not think these would most often have died naturally , ’ said dr @entity63			0
since the excavation , dr @entity7 has been carrying out a detailed analysis of evidence recovered from the site			0
these include 80 undisturbed flint artefacts found scattered around the elephant carcass and used to butcher it			2
‘ although there is no direct evidence of how this particular animal met its end , the discovery of flint tools close to the carcass confirm butchery for its meat , probably by a group of at least four individuals , ’ said dr @entity7			1
‘ the finding is massively important for our understanding of what early hominins were doing , and how they were able to colonise new terrain			0
‘ it 's so rare to find undisturbed remains of any sort from this period			0
this new evidence confirms the importance of elephant in their diet			0
' although it seems incredible that they could have killed such an animal , dr @entity114 claims it must have been possible with wooden spears researchers believe the deposits date to a warm period around 420,000 years ago , called @entity45 interglacial ‘ we know hominins of this period had these , and an elephant skeleton with a wooden spear through its ribs was found at the site of @entity130 in @entity131 in 1948 , ’ he said			2
these early humans suffered local extinction in @entity77 during the great ice age known as the anglian glaciation 450,000 years ago , but re-established themselves as the climate grew warmer again in the following @entity45 interglacial			2
an ability to hunt large mammals , and in particular elephants , as suggested by the @entity12 find , would go some way to explaining how these people then managed to push northwards again into what is now @entity144			0
the flint artefacts of these pioneer settlers are of a characteristic type known as @entity148 , mostly comprising simple razor - sharp flakes that would have been ideal for cutting meat , sometimes with notches on them that would have helped cut through the tougher animal hide			0
‘ the discovery of flint tools close to the carcass confirm butchery for its meat , probably by a group of at least four individuals , ’ said dr @entity7 ( pictured ) of @entity26 the discovery of this previously undisturbed elephant grave site is unique in @entity144 – where only a handful of other elephant skeletons have been found and none of which have produced similar evidence of human exploitation			1
dr @entity7 explained the @entity12 area would have been very different from today : ‘ @entity170 remains surrounding the elephant skeleton , including pollen , snails and a wide variety of vertebrates , provide a remarkable record of the climate and environment the early humans inhabited			1
‘ analysis of these deposits show they lived at a time of peak interglacial warmth , when the @entity12 was a lush , densely wooded tributary of the @entity185 , containing a quiet , almost stagnant swamp			0

discovery was made during the construction of @entity22 rail link in 2003
researchers have since been analysing flint tools found close to the carcass
they have concluded that a group of four early humans hunted the elephant , which would have been twice the size of today 's @entity15 variety
