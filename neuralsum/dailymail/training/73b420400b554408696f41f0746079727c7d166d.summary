millionaires and multimillionaires tend to be younger in the @entity4 than elsewhere in the western world because of several factors , says @entity54 's magazine which carried out the research in association with leading wealth consultancy company @entity57			1
@entity54 's editor @entity58 said : ' first , we have a long history of entrepreneurialism , building companies which grow to span the world			2
