by @entity0 published : 07:47 est , 2 october 2012 updated : 08:00 est , 2 october 2012 multiple personalities : @entity2 claims she is not responsible for defrauding @entity3 for $ 300,000 a once - respected doctor has blamed a ' mischievous ' alternate personality for defrauding @entity3 of $ 300,000 by writing prescriptions for painkiller pills which were later sold on the street			1
@entity2 , 56 , who founded an @entity10 institute and ran educational programmes in prisons , pleaded guilty to the crimes but said they were carried out by one of her many personalities			1
urging the court to show leniency , her defense lawyer @entity17 said @entity2 's crimes were really committed by a personality called @entity22 , who is ' mischievous , irresponsible , reckless and , as we have just discovered , criminal			1
' @entity2 decline to speak in court but in a letter to the judge , she too blamed @entity22 , saying she ' committed these crimes without telling @entity2 or the other parts of me about them			1

scam : @entity2 wrote prescriptions for tablets such as @entity57 , known in @entity46 as ' hillbilly heroin ' , which were later sold on the street for up to $ 20 each the government has recommended she go to prison for 11 years or more , but mr @entity17 says any prison time would be a death sentence because @entity2 has several severe medical issues that ca n't be treated in prison and require occasional emergency trips to a hospital			1
the judge seemed skeptical of the multiple personality argument			2
' i guess i 'm having trouble understanding that with the defendant 's remarkable medical career , having founded an @entity10 hospital ... it does n't seem to have impaired her ability to function as a medical professional , ' the judge said			0
she delayed sentencing after a prosecutor acknowledged @entity2 's severe medical issues and said a @entity83 official would have to say whether the prisons could handle her issues			2
twist of fate : the once - respected @entity2 ran an @entity10 awareness educational programme at @entity89 jail but could soon be headed there herself the government says @entity2 defrauded @entity3 out of about $ 300,000 , part of roughly $ 1 million that a wider conspiracy managed to scam from the program			0
