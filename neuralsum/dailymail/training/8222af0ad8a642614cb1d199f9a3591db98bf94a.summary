by @entity0 for the @entity1 millions of cat allergy sufferers know the symptoms only too well – red , itchy eyes , uncontrollable sneezes , coughing fits , even a nasty rash			2
but help could soon be at hand thanks to a @entity12 company working on a vaccine it says can render even the fluffiest feline totally harmless			0
@entity16 - based @entity15 says its revolutionary injection can ‘ neutralise ’ the cat itself , rather than forcing humans to resort to costly treatments that often have limited effect			1
a @entity12 company is working on a vaccine which it says can render even the fluffiest feline totally harmless to allergy sufferers it works by attacking a protein carried in cats ’ saliva , urine and sweat that is the most common cause of cat allergies			1
more than 725m people , about a tenth of the global population , are thought to be allergic to cats but options for alleviating the symptoms are limited			1
sufferers can take anti-histamines or have regular injections designed to stimulate the body ’s natural immune system			0
some websites recommend using air purifiers or even bathing your cat as often as possible , which can prove difficult if the animal does n’t cooperate			0
the new vaccine , dubbed @entity50 , works by attacking the @entity52 d 1 protein , the main allergen carried by cats and kittens			1
fel d 1 , present in saliva , urine and sweat , is spread all over the cat ’s fur when it licks itself clean			1
the protein then attaches itself to cat dander , tiny particles of dry skin one tenth the size of a dust mite			2
as cats prowl their territory , they leave dander on surfaces such as bedding and sofas , wreaking havoc on allergy sufferers whose symptoms are triggered by the protein			2
but @entity15 claims that @entity50 can ‘ neutralise ’ the @entity52 d 1 protein altogether , without harming the cat			1
it is spending up to £ 8million to commercialise research by @entity84 firm @entity83 , based at the @entity85 , in the hope of making @entity50 available through vets within three or four years			0

‘ it ’s a major problem in this country so this could be very significant , ’ she said			0
‘ some people avoid cats like the plague and when they are then exposed they could have a very serious reaction			2
’ ‘ it ’s also something that can cause chronic ongoing systems and a lot of people do n’t realise what the cause is			0
’ @entity15 said it believes that @entity50 could open up a new market for cat vaccinations worth as much as £ 250million			1
life sciences analysts at @entity114 firm @entity113 said : ‘ there is a large potential market for this vaccine			0
’ ‘ we believe that this approach will lead to a relatively straightforward solution for cat owners and the population that suffers from cat allergies , ’ they added .			1
