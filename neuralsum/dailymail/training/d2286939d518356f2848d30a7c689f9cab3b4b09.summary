http://web.archive.org/web/20150710231123id_/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2887923/Orphan-orangutan-just-wants-Mummy.html

with tins of formula milk filling the cupboards , bottles galore and a sterilising unit permanently in use , this nursery is no different from thousands of others across the country			2
jars of @entity10 for nappy rash are dotted about , there ’s a changing mat and plenty of fresh nappies			2
but as new mum @entity17 nurses her little charge , gently winding him after a meal and rubbing @entity21 into his aching gums as he teethes , it ’s clear this is no ordinary baby			2
instead , @entity24 is an orphaned 12 - week - old orangutan , brought into @entity26 in @entity27 earlier this month after his mother suddenly died from intestine problems a week after his birth in @entity31			1
but looking through the window with interest at this quaint scene is a far more important woman			0
it ’s @entity51 , an 18 - year - old orangutan who ’s been at the rescue centre since she was abandoned outside a @entity55 amusement park aged five			1
staff hope she will soon take over their duties and become the baby ape ’s mum			1
she ’s been chosen because her maternal instinct is so strong : she ’s had two sons of her own and , three years ago , adopted a tiny female called @entity64 , who had been abandoned by her mother			1
as soon as she saw the baby ’s plight , she stepped in and swept the little one up into her arms			0
but now @entity64 is three - and - a - half and staff feel her adoptive mum is ready for another challenge			1
they ’ve introduced them and @entity74 showed some interest , touching and sniffing the new baby , but she ’s yet to pick him up and take him as her own like she did with @entity78			1
‘ we ’re really confident she will love @entity82 , ’ says @entity79 , director of @entity26			1
‘ he ’s got everything he needs to bring out the nurturing instinct in her — huge eyes , cute little wriggles			0
’ swinging in : @entity24 is given a helping hand as he takes his first baby steps ( left ) and chewing on a teething ring to help soothe sore gums indeed he has			1
as i watch him — i ca n’t get too close because i ’ve got a cold and his small lungs make him vulnerable to infection — i , too , fall in love with this special little creature with his soft ginger fur , long arms and huge , gummy smile			1
now seven pounds , he ’s already trying to push himself up to stand			0
to encourage him , staff regularly hold his fingers and help him ‘ walk ’ a few baby steps			2
it ’s vital he builds up his strength so that , when he is finally adopted , he can hold on tight to his new mum as she whirls around the trees , high above the ground , in her enclosure			0
when he ’s not trying to stand up or sleep ( like most babies this is his major occupation ) , he plays with the teething ring above the baby mat he lies on , eyes darting round his little nursery			2
monkey business : the 12 - week - old orangutan snuggles up close to carer @entity17 , who wears a specially - made orange jacket with tassels that mimic orangutan fur so he learns how to hold on to his new mother tightly but @entity24 ’s eyes ca n’t yet focus properly and the experts at @entity26 believe this is why he has n’t yet bonded with @entity51			1
in the next few weeks , as he develops , this will happen naturally			0
then , says @entity79 , it ’s a ‘ done deal ’			0
‘ all he needs to do is look at @entity74 and reach out his hand , ’ she explains			1
‘ she ’s so maternal , she wo n’t be able to resist			2
‘ it will make all the difference to his life			0
he ’s missing out on so much			0
the only long - term relationship orangutans ever have is between a mother and her baby			1
it ’s vital he grows up with primates of his own kind , otherwise he will find it hard to fit in			2
’ normally , orangutan babies stay with mum for seven years — the longest childhood of any ape — picking up the skills they need to survive and get on with other primates			1
in their first year , they never leave their mother ’s side			1
staff worry that if @entity24 is n’t adopted , he ’ll fixate on one of his carers , not learn how to socialise with his own kind and never be accepted by the other 17 orangutans in the centre			1
it ’s why he has four people looking after him , not just one — to lessen the risk			0
and if anyone knows what ’s best for him , it ’s @entity26			1
it looks after 250 orphaned , abandoned and rescued primates and has @entity168 ’s only monkey crèche , which currently contains six baby orangutans			1
set up in @entity170 in 1987 by @entity171 — @entity79 ’s husband who died in 2007 of liver cancer — it receives no government grants , instead relying on donations and entrance fees			0
the baby orangutans and their mothers live in a building with a playroom kitted out with climbing frames , hammocks and ropes to encourage and teach them how to swing through trees			2
there ’s also a half - acre outdoor enclosure filled with trees and climbing frames			2
@entity189 is too small to go in this gym , but he can watch the goings - on , and learn orangutan behaviour through a window			1
once he ’s bonded with @entity51 — the name means ‘ good little girl ’ in @entity201 — it ’s where they ’ll spend the next few months			2
they met on his second day at @entity26			1
@entity24 was laid in a small tunnel next to his potential mum ’s bedroom then she was let in			1
she went straight over and touched him but , much to the keepers ’ disappointment , did n’t immediately sweep him up to her breast			0
‘ we hoped @entity74 would just stroll in and say : “ baby , ” ’ @entity79 admits			1
instead they let her visit him every day in the same way — keeping the visits ‘ short and sweet ’ so she does n’t get bored			0
until he ’s adopted , @entity189 ’s days start at 8.15am when he leaves the on - site house where he ’s spent the night with whichever carer is on duty and is carried to the nursery			2
there , he is fed formula milk by bottle every four hours , although he ’s expected to be weaned onto baby rice then pureed fruit and vegetables in the next few weeks			0
@entity24 , one of the ‘ critically endangered ’ @entity226 orangutans of whom there are only 7,000 left in the wild , gets around by clinging to his carers			1
they wear a specially - made orange jacket with tassels that mimic orangutan fur so he learns how to hold on to mum tightly — nobody wants him falling when she ’s swinging from tree to tree			1
‘ he clings on so tight that peeling him off is really hard work , ’ says @entity17			0
‘ i tie my hair back but he still sometimes manages to grab some and when he does , it really hurts			0
he ’s got a vice-like grip			0
‘ but he ’s such a cheerful little chap — he ’s got the most gorgeous temperament , very laid back and gentle			0
he never whinges and only cries when he ’s seriously hungry			0
potential parent : @entity247 cuddles up to three - year - old female orangutan , @entity64 , who she adopted after she was abandoned by her mother ‘ after feeding , i have to wind him			1
i change his nappies , too — he ’s so tiny he ’s in premature baby nappies			0
they ’re necessary because he does n’t have a mum to keep him clean and away from any mess			0
‘ then i put on the nappy cream — just like with a human baby			2
he ’s starting to teethe so i put @entity21 on his gums to try and ease any pain			0
the only thing i ca n’t do is shin up trees the way his mum would have done			0
’ even so , @entity17 knows human care is second best and ca n’t wait for @entity51 to step up to the mark			2
‘ we all adore him but he does n’t need us — he needs a mum , ’ she says			0
‘ if we can achieve that , we will have given him the best gift in the world			0

@entity24 , whose name means ' long eyelashes ' in @entity45 , is currently being nursed at @entity26 in @entity27
staff hope one of the other orangutans will adopt him so he does not fixate on human carers and become rejected
@entity279 babies stay with their mother for seven years picking up survival skills and get on with other primates
@entity74 , 18 - year - old orangutan , is potential *candidate* to be his mother for her strong maternal instincts
