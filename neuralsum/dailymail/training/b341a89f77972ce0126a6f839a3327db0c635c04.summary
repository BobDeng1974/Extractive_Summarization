a green - fingered grandfather spent 25 years creating a beautiful garden on a ' borrowed ' patch of barren wasteland			1
@entity4 , 88 , has plowed more than £ 10,000 into the l - shaped piece of land which belongs to a housing association , because his first floor flat in @entity9 , @entity10 , does not have a garden			1
fortunately @entity12 , the housing association which owns the property and garden in partnership with @entity17 , approves of the pensioner ’s efforts			1
fortunately they have praised the pensioner 's efforts mr @entity4 said : ‘ they like what i have done - everyone has been behind me all the way			1
’ ‘ my neighbours love the garden and say it really brightens up the flats			2
’ when retired coal miner mr @entity4 moved into the flat in 1988 the land was an uncared for patch of grass			1
he said : ‘ when i moved into the flat there were no plants and flowers , just a scruffy bit of grass			1
’ mr @entity4 set to work immediately and planted a golden privet hedge and ornamental maple tree			1
mr @entity4 , a former coal miner , started off by planting a hedge ( left ) and then turned his attentions to flowers he said : ‘ everything you see growing i bought and planted			2
‘ green fingers run in the family - my brother was a farmer and we ’ve always had a garden to look after			0
’ and his efforts have paid off because his gardening skills have bagged him prizes in local gardening competitions such as the annual @entity73 garden contest			0
after transforming the wasteland into a beautiful garden , @entity4 has won local horticultural contests having spent 35 years working in the mines , mr @entity4 likes to spend as much time as possible outdoors mr @entity4 , who lives with wife @entity79 , 86 , also grows fruit and vegetables on the plot which he shares with his neighbours who have been happy to lend a hand too			1
he said : ‘ everyone seems to enjoy it			0
when my petrol mower conked out the neighbours clubbed together to by me a new one			0
’ mr @entity4 , who spent 30 years underground as a miner in the @entity10 valleys , now prefers the great outdoors			1
he said : ‘ i have to be outside			0
i am out here for at least two or three hours every day - if it ’s raining i go in the shed and tidy up			0
even when it 's raining mr @entity4 goes outside to his garden shed to potter around and tend to the plants ‘ i ca n’t bend on my knees so i have tools that mean i can garden while standing up			1
‘ the biggest challenges i have are the weather and selecting the right plants to grow			0
’ @entity79 , his wife of 66 years , said : ‘ i ’m very proud of what @entity4 has created			2
‘ he ’s out there all the time , but i do n’t mind - sometimes if he ’s under my feet i send him back out			0
’ neighbour @entity107 , who has contributed plants and a bench for the garden , added : ‘ it ’s a pleasure to see all his hard work come out in bloom at this time of year			2
’ neighbourhood officer @entity114 from @entity12 said she looked forward to seeing the garden grow over the coming years			0
she said : ' i do n’t think i ’ve ever seen such beautiful and well - cared for communal gardens			0
' the neighbours take so much pleasure out of this wonderful garden that @entity4 has created			2
' everyone comments on how beautiful it is and how it is having such a positive impact on their lives			0

@entity4 was *disappointed* he did *n't* have a garden when he moved in
but he realised that the ' scruffy bit of grass ' next to his flat had potential
so he spent the next 25 years and £ *10k* transforming it into an oasis
the land he has put so much love into is owned by a housing association
but fortunately they approve of mr @entity4 's work to his home in @entity10
