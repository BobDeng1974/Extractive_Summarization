it 's @entity3 ! an extremely rare convergence this year of @entity5 and the start of @entity7 has created a frenzy of @entity10 proportions			1
there 's the number crunching : the last time it happened was 1888 , or at least the last time since @entity5 was declared a federal holiday by president @entity17 , and the next time may have @entity19 lighting their candles from spaceships 79,043 years from now , by one calculation			1
rare : @entity24 @entity19 are commemorating this once in an eon event with specially created cards posters			0
on november 28 , @entity5 and the first day of @entity7 coincide for the last time for more than 70,000 years once - in - a - lifetime opportunity : nine - year - old @entity29 , inventor and rising fourth - grader designed the ultimate @entity3 accessory : the @entity32 there 's the commerce : a 9 - year - old @entity36 boy invented the ' @entity32 ' and raised more than $ 48,000 on @entity37 for his already trademarked , @entity39 - shaped menorah			1
@entity41 - inspired t - shirts have a turkey perched on the neck of a guitar and implore ' @entity45			1
' the creators nabbed the trademark to ' @entity3			0
' songs have popped up with lyrics like these from ' @entity51 of @entity3 ' : ' imagine @entity52 , sitting down to roast turkey and passing the potatoes to @entity55 ... ' rabbi @entity56 , the song 's co-writer and co-head of the @entity59 in @entity60 , @entity61 , proudly declares his the jewish day school nearest @entity63			1
let 's not forget the food mash - ups commemorating the staying power of the @entity67 and the fighting prowess of the @entity19 , along with the miracle of one night 's oil lasting eight days			2
pumpkin latkes , apple - cranberry sauce and deep - fried turkey , anyone ? the perfect blendship ? @entity7 and @entity5 means there 'll be lots of candles and awesome food ! the best of both : @entity5 is normally a convergence of certain friends or family members , and @entity7 is normally celebrated with other loved ones , this dual holiday will bring new people together @entity5 is set as the fourth thursday in november , meaning the latest it can be is 11/28			1
11/28 is also the earliest @entity7 can be			2
the @entity87 calendar repeats on a 19 year cycle , and @entity5 repeats on a 7 year cycle			1
you would therefore expect them to coincide roughly every 19x7 = 133 years			0
looking back , this is approximately correct – the last time it would have happened is 1861			0
however , @entity5 was only formally established by president @entity17 in 1863			2
so , it has never happened before			0
why wo n't it ever happen again ? the reason is because the @entity87 calendar is very slowly getting out of sync with the solar calendar , at a rate of 4 days per 1000 years ( not bad for a many centuries old calendar ! ) this means that while presently @entity7 can be as early as 11/28 , over the years the calendar will drift forward , such that the earliest @entity7 can be is 11/29			2
the last time @entity7 falls on 11/28 is 2146 ( which happens to be a monday )			1
therefore , 2013 is the only time @entity7 will ever overlap with @entity5			1
you can see the start date of @entity7 as a function of time in the attached plots			1
in the long timescale plot , the drift forward is @entity109 course , if the @entity87 calendar is never modified in any way , then it will slowly move forward through the gregorian calendar , until it loops all the way back to where it is now			0
so , @entity7 will again fall on thursday , 11/28 ... in the year 79,811			1
' it 's pretty amazing to me that in this country we can have rich secular and rich religious celebrations and that those of us who live in both worlds can find moments when they meet and can really celebrate that convergence			1
there are a lot of places in the world where we would not be able to do that , ' @entity56 said			0
the lunisolar nature of the @entity87 calendar makes @entity7 and other religious observances appear to drift slightly from year to year when compared to the @entity24 , or @entity132 , calendar			1
but much of the intrigue over @entity7 this year is buried deep in the history of @entity5 itself , which has n't always been fixed in the same spot			1
that caused some initial confusion over @entity3 , aka @entity139			0
in 1863 , @entity17 declared @entity5 as the last thursday in november ( the month sometimes has five of those ) and the holiday remained there until president @entity143 signed a joint resolution of @entity145 fixing it as the fourth thursday , starting in 1942			2
since 1863 , @entity5 and the first full day of @entity7 on the gregorian calendar have not overlapped			1
@entity87 practice calls for the first candle of eight - day @entity7 to be lit the night before @entity5 this year , so technically @entity3 falls on the ' second candle ' night			1
and then there 's @entity151			0
before 1863 , each state decided on its own date for @entity5			2
as late as 1956 , @entity154 were still chowing down on turkey and stuffing a week later than everyone else , according to a history put together by @entity158 of the @entity160 movement of @entity161			0
that means @entity19 in that state might have also been lighting their first @entity7 candle in 1945 and 1956			2
there 's more early @entity5 lore and 2,000 years of calendar tinkering involving the @entity87 calendar , but we 'll spare you			2
i have a little dreidel : some have noticed that the event also creates a retail opportunity and a way for people to express their excitement for the phenomenon mark your calendars : it wo n't happen again for millennia @entity184 , a quantum physicist at @entity185 in @entity186 , @entity187 , puzzled on the convergence last january , in a blog post with buzzed - about line graphs picked up by others online			0
more than 100,000 people have visited the blog since then , he said , including some who questioned his calculations and prompted him to post a couple of clarifications			0
he had n't made it clear that he was referring to the ' second candle ' night of @entity7 , and he had n't realized @entity5 had shifted from the last to the fourth thursday of november			1
the interest , @entity184 said , ' has truly blown me away			0
i 've just been totally flabbergasted at the number of responses			0
' while the whole thing is lots of fun , is there anything truly cosmic happening here ? well , there 's @entity211 , which is scheduled to pass close by the sun on @entity5 this year and may provide a nice show — possibly even during daylight			1
or not , since comets ca n't always be counted on			0
mom - of - two @entity216 , who lives outside @entity218 , partnered with an artist and the @entity87 gift site @entity221 to create and sell souvenir t - shirts , cards and a poster			0
she sees a happy and meaningful coincidence and 10 percent of proceeds will go to @entity228 , a @entity87 hunger relief organization			0
' @entity230 ? it 's just a day when @entity19 and the rest of @entity24 are celebrating on the same day , ' she said			0
' it 's an opportunity for us to really celebrate the @entity87 @entity24 experience , and to give thanks in @entity24 for the religious freedom we enjoy here , and for making the @entity87 @entity24 experience possible			2
