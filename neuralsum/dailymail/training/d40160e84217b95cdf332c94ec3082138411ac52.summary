by @entity0 a six - year - old boy has stunned doctors by taking his first steps - despite battling a brain tumour which left him unlikely to ever walk			1
@entity5 was just two years old when he was diagnosed with a benign tumour that had been growing inside his brain even before he was born			1
the tumour delayed his development as a toddler - meaning he had n’t started learning to walk			1
he also suffered from tremors and also had to wear nappies until the age of five			0
@entity5 , six , has beaten the odds to take his first steps despite battling a brain tumour @entity5 ( pictured with his sister , @entity16 ) was diagnosed with a benign brain tumour when he was just two but @entity5 has defied the odds by taking his first few steps with the aid of a walking frame and has even set his sights on completing a 2km charity run this weekend			1
his mother @entity24 , from @entity25 , @entity26 , said : ‘ @entity5 has dealt with everything so well and is such a brave little boy , he is amazing			2
‘ the doctors could n’t promise us that he would ever walk , but ever since he got his walking frame it has allowed him to be so much more independent			1
‘ he walks like a toddler and is very unsteady on his feet , so it is a real struggle for him , but he is very determined			0
’ she added : ‘ i could n’t believe it when he said he wanted to run a marathon - we were just having breakfast one morning and he turned to me and said “ mummy , i want to do a marathon ”			0
‘ and it is amazing as it has all been entirely his choice - he decided he wanted to do it and that he wanted to raise money for the @entity47 where he receives treatment			0
@entity5 's tumour was picked up when his parents took him to specialists because they were concerned that he had not learned to walk			1
he is pictured with his mother , @entity24 in early 2010 @entity5 had surgery to remove the tumour but he then had to have another operation in may 2010 because doctors were worried that they had not managed to remove all of the tumour the first time ‘ i did have to let him down gently though and tell him he could n’t do a marathon , but we sat down together and decided on the @entity64 2km run			1
‘ he is going to do it all on his own with his frame and said that if he is n’t too tired at the end he wants to cross the finish line without his walker , just holding his dad ’s hand			2
’ @entity5 's parents first became concerned when he was two , when they realised he was taking a long time to learn to walk			1
mrs @entity73 and her husband @entity74 , 37 , took him to see countless doctors , but were repeatedly reassured that he would learn in time			0
but , unconvinced , they took him to see a neurologist who delivered the heartbreaking news in december 2010 that @entity5 had a brain tumour and needed immediate surgery			1
in september 2010 @entity5 's parents were told his tumour had returned and he had chemotherapy to shrink it @entity5 ( pictured with his sister , @entity16 ) is now in remission but is still having regular check ups @entity5 is now learning to walk with a frame and it is hoped he will eventually walk independently @entity5 was rushed into theatre on @entity89 to reduce the fluid on his brain , before undergoing a 12 hour operation a few weeks later to ‘ debulk ’ the tumour			1
he then went under the knife again in may 2010 after surgeons realised they may have missed some of the growth			2
then at a routine check - up in september 2010 , the family - who had since welcomed baby girl @entity16 , now three - received heart - breaking news that @entity5 ’s tumour had returned			1
mrs @entity73 : ‘ when @entity5 was first diagnosed he was only two , so he did n’t really understand what was going on			1
‘ it was terrifying when we found out that he had been living with a tumour for so long - i felt like i was to blame in some way for it because it had started during pregnancy			0
‘ and watching our baby go through chemotherapy was awful			0
he was extremely ill from it and could n’t eat at all - he had to be fed through a tube in his tummy			0
@entity5 is now planning to take part in a sponsored 2km run to raise money for the hospital that treats him mrs @entity73 said : ' @entity5 has dealt with everything so well and is such a brave little boy , he is amazing			2
' she is pictured with her husband , @entity74 , and children @entity5 and @entity16 mrs @entity125 said : ' watching our baby go through chemotherapy was awful			1
he was extremely ill from it and could n't eat at all - he had to be fed through a tube in his tummy			0
' he is pictured with his sister , @entity16 ‘ he lost all of his hair and looked so pale and fragile			0
and they had to reduce it after a year as he just could n’t deal with the dosage			0
‘ it was a horrible time for us a family			0
‘ and poor @entity16 was just a new - born baby and was being passed from pillar to post as we were spending so much time in the hospital with @entity5 which was really difficult			2
’ @entity5 is now in remission , but has to go back to hospital for scans every six months			1
normally , benign tumours can be treated just with surgery			0
however , if they return , chemotherapy and radiotherapy are sometimes used to shrink them			2
@entity5 is taking part in the @entity152 on saturday may 17 , and has already raised more than £ 600 for the @entity47 , in @entity26			2
