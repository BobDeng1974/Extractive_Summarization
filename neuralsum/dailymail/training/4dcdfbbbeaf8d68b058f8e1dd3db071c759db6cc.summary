desperate to burn the calories but really ca n't be bothered to leave your bed ? the latest @entity4 craze might be just the ticket			0
bulk perspiration , which involves being wrapped in something akin to an extremely hot electric blanket that promises to burn 1,000 calories a session , is fast becoming a weight loss sensation in @entity12			1
according to @entity14 , the ' urban sweat lodges ' are frequented by the likes of @entity16 and the @entity17			1
sweat it out : @entity16 ( left ) is a big fan of the treatment , which is offered at the likes of the @entity21 in @entity12 ( pictured right with founder @entity22 ) , and promises to burn 1,000 calories in an hour session the hour - long session , which costs £ 30 , sees you wrapped up in a padded infrared foil blanket which is slowly heated to @entity28 - that 's twice the temperature of the @entity30 desert			1
but how does it work ? ' infrared energy produces a uniform deep heat penetration without the usual sensation of feeling hot			2
this is achieved by using a specific @entity37 band of energy peaking at around 9.4 micons ; a level designed to penetrate beyond the skin ( where heat is most acutely felt ) to a depth where fat resides , ' reads the @entity21 's website , a salon offering the treatment in @entity12			1
' as this subcutaneous fat begins to heat , your body begins to thermo - regulate itself by producing sweat			2
all wrapped up : the hour - long session , which costs £ 30 , sees you wrapped up into a padded infrared foil blanket which is slowly heated to @entity56 ' and in the process of sweating , the multiple benefits are achieved … detoxing , skin conditioning , cardio fitness , relaxation , weight loss , and emotional health			1
' @entity22 , founder of the @entity21 in @entity65 , @entity66 , told the paper : ' this technology was originally used in @entity69 helping to fuse broken bones			2
but people found they slept better and their skin and digestion improved			0
' it burns a lot of calories , not just from water loss , but because the body , heated to 70 - 75 degrees , is tricked into thinking it has a fever			1
' so as the temperature goes up , up and up , the body tries to go down , down , down			2
this requires a lot of energy			0
' toxins are stored as a layer of fat protecting your organs			0
by sweating , you lose toxins and your body no longer needs this barrier and the water we retain from stress is removed			2
' @entity22 , who once weighed 23st , swears by the method herself			0
in eight years , she has lost 11st , which she claims is down to her sessions three times a week			0
thanks to the @entity17 , who paid a visit to the @entity21 in their hit reality show , @entity17 , there is a lengthy waiting list			1
keeping up : thanks to @entity110 and @entity111 , who paid a visit to the @entity21 in their hit reality show , there is a lengthy waiting list but does it work and , most importantly , is it safe ? dr @entity118 , nutritionist specialising in women 's health from @entity120 , said : ' a sweat lodge has been traditionally used as an ancient ceremony for centuries			1
it was used for marriages , births , death anything where there was a new beginning or change in life			0
' but it is very different from the urban sweat lodge suggested here			0
in a traditional sweat lodge hot stones are used and it is the steam that comes from the rocks that is supposed to help clear out toxins			0
the urban sweat lodge is not using steam but the equivalent of an electric blanket ( using infrared ) to heat up the body			1
there will be contraindications for some people who have heart problems , high blood pressure , during menstruation and in pregnancy			0
' but my biggest concern is that if people are using it for weight loss , it is not changing any of the unhealthy lifestyle habits , such as eating unhealthy foods and not exercising			1
so people are looking at it as a quick fix			0
