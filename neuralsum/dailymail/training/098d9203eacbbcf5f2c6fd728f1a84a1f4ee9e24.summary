a romantic getaway to @entity1 was ruined for one couple after @entity2 refused to accept one of their passports - despite it still having a year to run			1
@entity6 , 23 , and her partner @entity7 , 25 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , had booked a three - day trip to the @entity12 capital and were scheduled to fly out from @entity13 on tuesday			1
after passing through security and checking in their luggage , they had made it to the gate when they were asked to show their passports			0
a romantic trip to @entity1 for @entity7 and his partner @entity6 was ruined when @entity2 refused to accept the former 's passport after miss @entity6 was allowed to walk through to board the plane , mr @entity7 was told there was a problem with his passport			1
an @entity2 member staff called their manager four times to discuss the matter			2
miss @entity6 then claims the manager requested a second opinion from a worker who ' looked about 21 ' and mr @entity7 was told he would n't be permitted to board			1
this was despite mr @entity7 's passport , which is the old @entity42 style issued nine years ago , still having a year to run until it expired			1
the @entity45 worker has used the passport on @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and an @entity2 flight in the last 12 months			1
speaking to @entity51 , miss @entity6 said : ' four times the manager was contacted , but i find it bad that they could n't even come down and inspect for themselves			1
' they asked first to see some more @entity59 , which @entity7 showed them his drivers ' licence , and they agreed it was definitely him			0
@entity7 's passport photo and the copy inside is clear and visible , but the front is , as his partner @entity6 accepts , ' tatty ' ' when the manager asked for a second opinion , i overheard the staff member saying that they ' would n't accept it '			1
' the passport is nine years old and obviously looks a bit tatty , but it clearly shows who he is and is n't falling apart			0
' to add insult to the situation , i was told i could proceed as there was no problem with my passport			0
' miss @entity6 , who was travelling to @entity1 for the first time , describes how the incident had left her in tears , and she demanded to see the manager			1
sadly for @entity7 and @entity6 , they never got to enjoy their romantic trip to @entity1 ' as we were going to see the manager , i could see the plane taking off and i was just so upset , ' she added			2
' when we met them , we were told as a " goodwill gesture " that we could re-book flights for later in the day for £ 65 each , but that they ' could n't guarantee ' @entity7 's passport would be accepted			1
' so instead of walking around @entity1 , and going through all the activities we planned , we were instead going back home			0
' @entity97 student @entity96 told @entity51 that in correspondence with @entity2 since the incident the airline has incorrectly called them ' @entity102 and @entity103 ' and has offered a goodwill gesture of airport taxes back - £ 54 , minus £ 10 for processing the form			2
' they said the passport had looked like it had been through a washing machine , but it had n't , ' added miss @entity6			2
' @entity2 have told us they are standing by what their ground staff said , which i find very upsetting			2
' when you are sitting at the gate , you never think it could be you who misses the flight in tears , but that was what happened			0
' a spokesperson for @entity2 said : ' @entity2 works closely with the authorities and complies with their guidance to ensure the safety and security of all passengers and staff			0
' @entity2 can not allow any passenger to travel on their planned flight with documentation damaged to such a degree that its authenticity is brought into question			0
it is the passenger 's responsibility to have suitable documentation for travel			0
' ' we would like to apologise for any inconvenience			0
