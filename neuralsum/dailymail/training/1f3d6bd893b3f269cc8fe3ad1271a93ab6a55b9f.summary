lifeguard @entity7 is accused of failing to properly supervise pool users ‘ she was at work and got talking to a customer while she was on duty , ’ @entity25 , prosecuting , told the court			1

@entity39 , 35 , went for a brief induction at the centre ’s gym and returned to see her four children in the pool ’s shallow end through a glass window			2
she then went to get change for a locker and on returning could n’t see her son			0
she said : ‘ @entity21 was n’t there and i kind of panicked			0
‘ when i got the children ’s attention they could n’t hear me through the glass			2
when they did finally understand they pointed towards the changing room			0
‘ then i heard the alarm and people were coming out of the pool			2
’ @entity60 and @entity62 lifeguard @entity61 , 24 , told jurors that conversations with customers of more than two minutes were not permissible			0
@entity60 and @entity62 in @entity66 , where the schoolboy drowned jurors heard that five lifeguards were on duty that day , and from the man @entity7 was talking to , @entity71 lifeguards took half - hour shifts overseeing one area of the centre and the most recent changeover had occurred at 4.30pm – 19 minutes before a 999 call was made about the drowning			1

he said he went over to chat to @entity7 about a previous incident in which he had been told the shorts he wore were too long to swim in			1
he added : ‘ she was concentrating on her job and i do n’t think i distracted her			0
’ mr @entity25 told @entity89 : ‘ this defendant was a lifeguard and her job was to look after people who came to swim at the public pool			2
‘ customers are at risk if the lifeguard allows themselves to become distracted			0
it is fundamental to what they do that their whole attention must be focused on the pool			2
