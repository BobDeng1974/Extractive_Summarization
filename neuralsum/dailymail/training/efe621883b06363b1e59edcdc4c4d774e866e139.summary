by @entity0 published : 05:29 est , 9 october 2013 updated : 06:03 est , 9 october 2013 a woman terrified of being an overweight bride refused to set a date for her wedding until she managed to slim down			2
@entity6 , 26 , from of @entity7 , @entity8 , weighed nearly 17 stone when she got engaged to sweetheart @entity10			1
she accepted and the couple got engaged - but loathed the idea of being what she called a ' fat bride '			1
instead , @entity6 kept her fiance waiting for seven years until she was slim enough to fit into her dream dress			1
it took countless diets and @entity10 annually proposing to her again , asking if she was ready to tie the knot , before @entity6 finally reached her target weight			1
@entity6 before ( l ) and after ( r ) shedding weight and finally getting married seven years later now @entity6 has finally glided down the aisle to wed her beau weighing a healthy 11st 9lbs after shrinking from a size 22 to a size 10			1
she said : ' i refused to set a date because i did n't want to be a fat bride			1
' i tried every diet but i would always start craving something and that would be the end of it			0
' @entity10 has been patient and kept asking me on the same date for seven years			1
he 's been great and very supportive			0
' @entity6 struggled with her weight while working as a waitress at a hotel - where @entity10 was head waiter - because food was always available in the staff accommodation			1
she later left the hotel and started working for a pharmacy , where one of her jobs was to offer advice on leading a healthy lifestyle			0
it took seven years , lots of different diets and annual repetition of proposals before they married @entity10 says he managed to stay patient because he loves her and she was definitely worth the wait @entity6 said : ' @entity10 and i both worked in the hotel and our shifts were all over the place so we never really had the chance to cook			1
' we were surrounded by a fish and chip shop , @entity64 and @entity65 takeaways , so we just ate conveniently			0
it was all the wrong stuff			0
' being a waitress was an active job			0
i could do it but i ended up a sweaty mess and you do n't want somebody like that serving your dinner			2
' i 've worked in a pharmacy for the past three and a half years and i have to promote healthy eating			0
' i was massively obese and i was suppose to give advice about that			0
i felt like such a hypocrite			0
' some of my friends went to dance classes but i could n't go - even if i could do the moves , i could n't wear the outfits			2
size 22 @entity6 ( l ) was surrounded by a fish and chip shop and takeaways , so just ate conveniently ' i did n't do much sport or exercise before			1
i hated going clothes shopping because there was only a few clothes shops in my town that had sizes big enough to fit me			0
' i could n't go shopping with my friends because i found it embarrassing but now i can swap clothes with them			2
' as a result of her dodgy diet @entity6 ballooned to a weight of 16st 9lbs			1
but a year after joining @entity102 she began shopping for her wedding dress and could even swap outfits with her three best friends who became her bridesmaids			2
@entity6 reached her target weight of 11st 9lbs just two weeks before her big day and even had to have her dress altered - because she was still losing weight			1
she said : ' it was perfect timing			0
' i ordered my dress from an @entity114 company in april and when it arrived in june it fitted perfectly			2
' but when i tried it on two weeks before the wedding it did n't fit			2
i had to have four inches taken in because the weight just kept falling off			0
@entity6 ballooned to 16st 9lbs , but joined @entity120 slimmers and later began shopping for her dress ' it was so easy			1
the more weight i lost the more interested i became			0
' @entity6 soaked up the compliments from family and friends on her big day at @entity126 , @entity127 , where she finally married @entity10 last month			1
guests were treated to a slap - up meal of prawns , salmon , chicken and cheesecake			0
the happy couple then jetted off on a romantic honeymoon to @entity136 and the newly - wed bride packed a bikini in her suitcase for the first time			2
@entity6 said : ' the honeymoon was phenomenal			2
all my clothes were either size 10 or size 12 and i bought my first ever bikini which i wore proudly			1
' in the past i sometimes needed a seatbelt extension on the plane because it either would n't fasten or it would dig into me			0
@entity6 and her now - husband @entity10 at their wedding last month ' sometimes i would be too embarrassed to ask for it and just suffered the pain			1
i did n't have that problem this time			0
' proud husband @entity10 added : ' @entity6 's transformation is fantastic , she 's looking good			1
' i asked her every year to set a date but she would always just say ' not this year '			0
' i managed to stay patient because i love her and she was definitely worth the wait			0
' the wedding was great and @entity6 looked fantastic in her wedding dress			1
