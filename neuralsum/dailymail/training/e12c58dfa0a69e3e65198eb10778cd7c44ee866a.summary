on june 6 , 2006 , @entity9 was pitching when the batter rocketed a line drive off the metal bat he was swinging			1
the ball slammed into @entity9 's chest , just above his heart , knocking him backward			1
he clutched his chest , then made a motion to reach for the ball on the ground to pick it up and throw to first base to get the runner out			0
but he never made it that far			0
the ball had struck his chest at the precise millisecond between heartbeats , sending him into cardiac arrest , according to his doctors			0

@entity1 struggles : the injury has left @entity9 , left , nearly blind in one eye and unable to walk without assistance since 2006 , several towns in northern @entity3 banned the use of non-wooden baseball bats , and the @entity153 followed suit , putting in place a similar restriction on high school games			1
