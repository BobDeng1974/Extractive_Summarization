by @entity0 death - defying robots that crawl over spacecraft are a familiar sight in science fiction films			0
but in reality , how would they stick to a surface travelling at thousands of kilometres per hour while remaining mobile ? the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) believes it has the answer : a hull - crawling ‘ gecko robot ’ that uses tiny microfibres to attach to almost anything			1
the tiny legged prototype could be the forerunner of automatons which crawl along the hulls of spacecraft , cleaning and maintaining them the space agency has now created a tiny legged prototype that could be the forerunner of automatons which crawl along the hulls of spacecraft , cleaning and maintaining them			2
its footpads are covered with dry microfibres modelled on the toe hair of the gecko , which is celebrated for its ability to scuttle up windows and along walls yet not leave a trace			1
the lizard does the trick through millions of ultra-fine hairs called setae , which interact with the climbing surface to create a molecular attraction known as the van der waals force			1
pictured is a microscopic view of mushroom - shaped @entity51 - inspired ' footpad terminators ' used to stick climbing robots on vertical surfaces			2
the micrometre - scale terminators are sufficiently tiny that atomic interactions between them and the surface come into play @entity60 ’s footpads are covered with dry microfibres modelled on the toe hair of the gecko			1
a gecko ’s feet are sticky due to a group of tiny hairs with ends just 100 – 200 nanometres across – around the scale of individual bacteria			0
this is sufficiently tiny that atomic interactions between the ends of the hairs and the surface to create a molecular attraction known as the van der waals force , @entity77 forces are relatively weak electric forces that attract neutral molecules to one another in gases , in liquefied and solidified gases , and in almost all organic liquids and solids			1
the force comes from fluctuations in charge distributions between neighbouring molecules , which need not be polar ; their charge fluctuations naturally fall into synch , creating an attractive force			1
researchers at @entity92 's @entity91 first built a 240 - gram ( eight - ounce ) tank - like gecko - bot , using tracks with microfibre treads			1
they then developed this into a six - legged climbing robot , nicknamed @entity98			2
‘ this approach is an example of biomimicry , taking engineering solutions from the natural world , " said team leader @entity99			0
the dry adhesive that helps @entity98 climb walls has now been put through its paces at a materials - testing lab at @entity8 's @entity8 and @entity109 ( @entity110 ) in @entity111 , the @entity112			1
replicating the vacuum and temperatures of space , but not the zero gravity , the tests found that the adhesive ' worked like a charm ' , the agency said			0
‘ a depth - sensing indentation instrument was used inside a vacuum chamber to precisely assess the dry adhesive 's sticking performance , ’ said @entity8 specialist @entity120			2
‘ experimental success means deployment in space might one day be possible			0
’ @entity98 's six legs each have four degrees of freedom , which enables the ‘ gecko - bot ’ to shift from horizontal to vertical environments			1
dry adhesives in space are compelling because other options have to be ruled out for safety reasons			0
sticky tape is n’t possible because it collects dust , becomes less sticky over time and in a vacuum gives off fumes			0
magnets are out too as they can not stick to composite surfaces and their magnetic field could affect instruments			0
the robot clings to surfaces using a gecko - inspired dry adhesive technology			2
@entity8 testing shows it is , in principle , workable in the vacuum conditions of space and @entity153 is also excluded , as it needs a mating surface of hooks - and these can break off and become a hazard			0
gecko setae are microscopic : their ends are just 100 - 200 nanometres , or 100 - 200 billionths of a metre , across			0
by comparison , the human hair is around 100,000 nanometres in diameter			0
‘ we 've borrowed techniques from the micro-electronics industry to make our footpad terminators , ’ said mr @entity99			0
‘ technical limitations mean these are around 100 times larger than a gecko 's hairs , but they are sufficient to support our robot 's weight			1
’ one of the @entity98 wall - crawler robot 's six feet , with six degrees of freedom for agile climbing and dry adhesives on its footpad to keep it stuck to surfaces			1

a prototype , named @entity98 , has footpads covered with dry microfibres
like a gecko 's hairs , these fibres create a force known as ' @entity77 '
*traditional* glue is not *effective* on fast - moving *satellites*
the force comes from fluctuations in charge distributions between neighbouring molecules , causing them to attract each other and stick
@entity98 could be used to clean and maintain the hulls of spacecrafts
