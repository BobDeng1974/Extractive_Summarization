a pair of @entity2 adventurers were celebrating last night after smashing two world records driving 10,300 miles from @entity4 to @entity5 - in a lightning fast 10 - and - a - half days			1
@entity8 @entity7 and @entity9 shaved more than three days off the previous record for the route , crossing the finish line at @entity13 at 5.30pm yesterday , just 10 days , 13 hours and 30 minutes after they set off from the @entity16 city			1
not only did the pair tear up that record , they also set the fastest time for doing the journey in either direction , beating a previous best set by @entity22 and @entity23 and @entity24 , going from @entity5 to @entity4 in 2010			1
record breakers : @entity7 , 53 , ( left ) and @entity9 , 50 , ( right ) who have smashed two world records for the epic 10,300 mile drive from @entity4 to @entity5 flying the flag : the pair are pictured waving @entity30 as they crossed the finish line in @entity5 's @entity13 yesterday evening @entity7 and @entity9 averaged 43mph along the route and covered more than 1,000 miles per day in a tiny 875cc @entity35			1
mr @entity7 , 53 , chariman of the @entity36 , said : ' the thought of reaching @entity13 has kept us going rather than falling asleep from exhaustion			1
' the best part of the whole trip is getting to @entity5 and knowing we have succeeded in our ambition and that nine months of planning has worked			2
' the trip has been a real eye - opener			2
' it has been one hell of an experience - tough and , at times , extremely gruelling			0
' we have been effectively living in the car			0
pretty much the only times we got out were for fuel stops and borders			0
' but we have got no regrets about the @entity35 as a choice of car			2
' it is one of the smallest cars you could possibly buy on the @entity2 market but it has been perfect , nippy and powerful enough to do the job of crossing two continents			0
' on sunday night , we had a big diversion up the right side of @entity65 because of snow			2
we have had just about every extreme along the way you could imagine			0
tough terrain : @entity7 and @entity9 are pictured here in the @entity35 passing an overloaded local truck in @entity73 long journey : the pair 's route took them through 13 countries across two continents ' but we have had a terrific amount of attention wherever we have gone with locals travelling halfway across their country to cheer us on			1
' they drove over 13 countries , including some of the world 's most volatile , in two continents and their £ 7,000 @entity35 became the first car to cross from @entity88 into @entity89 over a new land frontier			1
@entity7 and @entity9 passed through @entity91 , even though the country 's borders are officially closed to foreigners , but the @entity96 uprising forced them to take a ferry from @entity100 capital @entity98 to @entity101 over the weekend			1
even a combination of snow in southern @entity65 a delayed @entity103 train and rush hour traffic in @entity5 could n't stop them writing their name into the record books			2
raising more than £ 10,000 for the @entity73 charity , which helps @entity16 farmers increase their harvest in a bid to tackle food shortages , @entity7 and @entity9 also passed through @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , and @entity88 among other countries			1
difficult route : the pair broke the record despite encountering a few problems along the way			2
mr @entity9 is pictured here looking under the @entity35 's bonnet as an armed soldier watches on in @entity73 @entity7 said that the hardest part of the trip had been a stretch in northern @entity118 , near the town of @entity132 , known as the ‘ road to @entity133 ’			1
it runs through a desert , where the track disapears in places and is littered with huge potholes in others			0
he said : ' we had a long night picking our way through boulders the size of football			2
' but the biggest eye - opener was the @entity91 city of @entity147 , scene of the bloodiest fighting during the revolution that toppled @entity151 in 2011			0
@entity7 added : ' we were driving around the streets at night with road checks every 500 yards or less			1
' there were kids everywhere roaming around in pick - up trucks with machine guns			0
' that was quite an experience			0
' describing their arrival at the @entity91 border on the pair 's blog , mr @entity7 wrote : ' we have shaken hands with our new team - an armed guard will lead us , another armed guard will follow			1
river crossing : the adventurous pair are pictured here with the @entity35 crossing the @entity172 from @entity115 to @entity116 by ferry and they 're off : @entity7 and @entity9 are pictured here at the very start of their trip in front of @entity4 's famous @entity179 ' nobody seems at all bothered by the @entity181 across the front of the @entity35 ... ' a chilling reminder of @entity91 ’s recent past - as we waited for stamps in our passports , there were three muffled explosions			1
' we ask the obvious question and back came the reply with a casual shrug of the shoulders - ‘ people with no visas risk walking around the outside of the walls here , setting off land - mines ’			0
' nobody left the queue in the shabby passport office to go and look			0
' suddenly , our passports are back all approved and we are on the move passing through a rusty gate			0
' we are now driving into @entity91 - when plenty warned us it would prove to be a border too far , an immovable anvil which would see the hammer come down on our nine months of planning			0
' and in @entity119 they almost suffered their ' worst nightmare ' when they came close to running out of petrol because of a national shortage			0
support : locals created a banner welcoming the pair to @entity88 mr @entity7 , from @entity219 in @entity220 , and mr @entity9 , a car restorer from @entity222 , @entity223 , also faced tropical thunderstorms , river crossings and desert tracks along the way			1
they had been taking it turns to drive while the other ate food from army - issue self - heating cans and tried to grab some rest on a child ’s mattress laid across the back seat			0
the only tools they took to keep the car on the road were an adjustable spanner and a hammer along with a roll of gaffer tape and a tin of superglue			0
this year is the 80th anniversary of the first attempt to drive from @entity5 to @entity4 in a @entity249 , a drive that took five months			2
since then , many have tried to set the fastest time in vehicles ranging from a @entity253 , @entity254 , @entity255 , @entity256 and @entity257			0
the previous record for the @entity4 to @entity5 route stood at 14 days , 19 hours and 26 minutes and was set by @entity261 officer brigadier @entity260 and his wife @entity262 in 1983 - in a @entity263			1
the record for completing the trek in the opposite direction stood at 11 days , 14 hours and 11 minutes .			1

@entity7 and @entity9 crossed the finish line in @entity5 last night
they completed the route in just 10 days , 13 hours and 30 minutes
the pair covered more than 1,000 miles per day in a tiny 875cc @entity35
