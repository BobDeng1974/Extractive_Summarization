a potentially deadly bacteria has been accidentally released from a high - security research laboratory leading to serious safety fears			1
the burkholderia pseudomallei bacteria was found in animals at the @entity5 in @entity6 , which is just 35 miles north of @entity7			1
the bacteria , primarily found in south - east @entity9 , can spread to animals and humans through direct contact with contaminated soil and water			1
a potentially deadly bacteria has been accidentally released from a high - security research laboratory leading to serious safety fears ( stock image ) but despite thorough investigations by multiple authorities the cause of the release and extent of the contamination are still unknown			1
it is the latest in a series of significant accidents that have taken place across the country			0
@entity29 , a biosafety expert from @entity30 in @entity31 , said the release was worrying			2
@entity33 can cause a potentially serious disease in people and animals called melioidosis			1
@entity38 commonly involves the lungs and has a wide range of symptoms including fever , headache , loss of appetite , muscle and joint pain			0
it is often mistaken as pneumonia or tuberculosis			0
several countries have studied using the bacteria as a bioweapon because strains can be resistant to multiple antibiotics			2
if the disease is left untreated it is fatal			1
the overall mortality rate is 40 per cent but in @entity59 , where the bacteria is endemic , it is up to 50 per cent			2
confirmed infections are relatively rare			0
' the fact that they ca n't identify how this release occurred is very concerning , ' he told @entity66			2
' human error is always the first explanation you should consider for a laboratory accident			0
the easiest way to transfer something from one place where it 's supposed to be , to another where it is n't supposed to be is by a worker moving from one place to the other			0
' research was being completed at the center using rodents to try and find a vaccine against the bacteria			1
but at least four rhesus macaques - monkeys that were kept in a separate part of the 500 - acre facility - have been accidentally exposed to it			2
the first was discovered nearly three months ago in november and two have since died			0
all four were in the center 's veterinary hospital at the same time , leading to speculation that it could have been where the animals were exposed			1
at least four rhesus macaques - monkeys that were kept in a separate part of the 500 - acre facility - have been exposed to the bacteria ( stock image ) but one @entity102 @entity101 ( @entity101 ) investigator was also hospitalised after blood tests showed she had antibodies indicating a current or prior exposure to the bacteria			1
authorities are concerned that too few samples have been taken to decide whether livestock and domestic animals are at risk			0
only 39 soil samples were taken from the grounds - far less than the 100 recommended by previous research completed in @entity59			0
@entity115 , director of the center , said : ' we 're taking this extraordinarily seriously			0
it 's very disturbing to us			0
' there has never been a public health threat			1

bacteria released by @entity5 , @entity6
@entity33 causes potentially fatal infectious disease
spreads to animals and humans through contaminated soil and water
two monkeys have died from disease and one investigator hospitalised
center treating release as ' serious ' but denies any public health threat
