click here for all the stats and heat maps from @entity5 's @entity4 service the swan dive in front of the @entity8 was reminiscent of @entity9 throwing himself at the mercy of @entity12 ’s supporters at @entity13 20 years ago			1
@entity14 - ‘ he is one of us ’ , as they sing - was more than entitled to launch himself in front of them after scoring @entity12 ’s remarkable winner at @entity8			1
spurs , most certainly , did not			0
@entity22 can hold an inquest into this shambolic performance at a later date , but the facts are that they overcame 10 man @entity28 to record their first league win in a month			2
they did it , partially , because @entity14 ’s enthusiasm inspired some work - shy plodders in this @entity12 team after replacing @entity35 in the 57th minute			1
@entity35 did n’t fancy this one			2
@entity14 is chased by his team - mates after scoring the winner in the last moments of the game at @entity8 @entity14 's free - kick deflected off @entity42 's head and past @entity43 in the @entity28 net in the 90th minute @entity14 , on as a substitute , scored the winner before diving in front of the travelling @entity12 supporters the travelling @entity12 fans celebrate with the @entity12 players in front of them at @entity8 on sunday @entity28 : @entity43 7 ; @entity53 6.5 , @entity54 7.5 , @entity42 6 , @entity55 6.5 ( @entity56 90 ) ; @entity57 6.5 , @entity58 6.5 , @entity59 6 , @entity60 6.5 ; @entity61 6.5 , @entity62 7 ( @entity63 74 )			1

att : 32 , 049 referee : @entity92 6 credit to @entity14 at the death because every @entity12 fan worldwide watching this game on television was screaming out for @entity80 to take the 90th minute free - kick			1
@entity14 demanded the ball off him and scored , thanks to a deflection from the unfortunate figure of @entity42 in @entity28 ’s wall			1
‘ @entity80 and @entity14 were on the free - kicks but football is about emotion and confidence , ’ admitted @entity22			1
‘ he shot and he scored			0
it was a good decision			0
we are very happy because in every competition he scores			0
’ it will certainly take some explaining how @entity69 ’s team , who scored for the first time in 547 minutes and were a man down when @entity61 was sent off , lost this game			1
this is six defeats on the spin for @entity69 ’s team and they are only nine away from equalling @entity123 ’s record of 15 in the @entity124 , set in 2002/03 , now			0
at least @entity28 scored , though			1
@entity57 , this willing workhorse down the right , finished the move after 16 minutes when he slid in to meet @entity129 ’ @entity131 ’s deft , left foot touch			2
at that point , @entity12 were building up a head of steam towards their annual november crisis as they searched for their first @entity124 victory since the streaky 1 - 0 win over @entity138 on october 3			2
@entity12 ’s defence , dreadful as it is , needs organisation , structure and discipline if they are to make their way back up the table			2
@entity61 , who was subdued on his return to the team in the 2 - 0 defeat at @entity148 last monday , had flashed an early header wide of @entity71 ’ goal			1
‘ they could n’t handle him , ’ claimed @entity69 and he was right			0
he hit the crossbar with another , grafting outside the area and then spinning @entity12 ’s defence ( it did n’t take much , granted ) to carve out the opening			2
up front , @entity12 need players who will take responsibility to score goals			0
@entity82 , who score here last season , spooned an effort hopelessly high over @entity43 ’s goal after @entity28 had taken the lead			1
@entity35 , through on goal in the first half , was stopped when @entity43 timed his run perfectly to pinch the ball of his toes and sent it wide for a corner			1
you know things are bad at this club when the fans are demanding ‘ we want @entity177 out ’ just minutes before they got the substitution they craved : @entity14			2
@entity178 grabs @entity12 's equaliser in the 84th minute against 10 - man @entity28 , and they soon grabbed the winner @entity61 shoves @entity81 in the face after kicking out at @entity80 , and was shown a straight red card referee @entity92 took his time to come to a decision , but it seemed the correct one in the end @entity61 gets involved in a melee near the dugout as players from both @entity28 and @entity12 get involved @entity61 walks down the tunnel at @entity8 after being shown his marching orders for a petulant incident @entity79 , substituted at the break for tactical reasons , was dreadful			1
‘ it was tactical , ’ admitted @entity22			0
‘ sometimes you just need to change			0
’ @entity35 , also , was borderline disgrace			0
at one stage the captain @entity73 had carelessly booted the ball high into the night sky from an innocuous cross			0
what is their problem ? no - one knows			0
at that stage , it was easy to wonder whether @entity12 would have the gumption to get themselves back into this game			0
@entity14 saw it differently , immediately directing a header into the arms of @entity43			1
@entity217 rose to the challenge and booked for a foul on @entity58 after an hour , catching him with a stud when he came off a long run up to slid into the @entity28 youngster			0
@entity57 wheels off after scoring @entity28 's opener at @entity8 on sunday against @entity12 @entity57 slid in to connect with @entity226 's cross from the right after 16 minutes , ending @entity28 's goal drought @entity57 slides in ahead of @entity12 defender @entity73 as @entity71 watches the ball creep in the near post @entity231 miles @entity28 111.1 69.0 @entity58 90 12.2 7.6 @entity60 90 11.4 7.1 @entity53 90 11.1 6.9 @entity12 115.7 71.9 @entity81 90 11.7 7.3 @entity178 90 11.2 7.0 @entity232 90 11.0 6.8 that led to confrontations all over the field and @entity61 , who will be suspended for three games following his dismissal , was next in the frame			1
@entity81 was the one to call it on with the @entity28 forward , rutting with @entity61 after a man - o - man squabble in front of the dug - outs			1
‘ i did n’t see it , ’ claimed @entity22			0
@entity61 shoved @entity81 and referee @entity92 , who failed to spot @entity247 pushing @entity28 players around , sent him off			1
the @entity28 forward ’s punishment is a three - game ban against @entity252 , @entity138 and @entity253			2
he deserves a degree of sympathy			0
that incident somehow provoked @entity12 , rattling them and their fans as they hurtled towards defeat			0
incredibly , just when it looked like @entity22 and his team were making a pig ’s ear of this game , @entity178 equalised for them after 86 minutes			1
the @entity12 midfielder was at the back stick to score , beating @entity43 with their best chance of the game			1
that ’s when the nerves set in around this stadium , with fans pacing up and down gangways as they willed this game to end at one - apiece			0
there was never any chance of that			0
@entity14 , this talismanic figure in a @entity12 shirt , sent the fans back down to @entity283 grinning from ear to ear after his remarkable winner			1
after this , he really is one of them			0
@entity289 goalkeeper @entity43 , who had a fine first - half on sunday , celebrates @entity57 's opener at @entity8 @entity73 fails to convert from close range as @entity43 looks to dive on the ball in the @entity28 penalty area in the first - half @entity61 's diving header goes wide of the mark as @entity28 made their impression on the game in the opening stages @entity178 scored his fifth goal of the season and was all over the attacking third - click here for more from @entity306 @entity28 's @entity307 midfielder @entity59 shrugs @entity12 's @entity178 off in midfield at @entity8 @entity35 , in the team again despite @entity14 's impressive performances , gets up ahead of @entity53 @entity311 striker @entity35 was released through on goal in the first - half , with @entity53 chasing shadows behind him @entity35 was one - on - one with @entity43 , and struck low to the @entity289 keepers ' right in front of the @entity8 but @entity43 stopped fantastically , with both teams having a share of chances in the opening 45 minutes @entity53 ( left ) attempts to shrug @entity12 's @entity322 midfielder @entity79 off the ball in the middle of the park @entity330 striker @entity61 , only just back in the side on return from injury , caused a problem for the @entity12 defence @entity28 midfielder @entity58 plays a ball across the midfield in the second - half at @entity8 @entity61 hits the bar for @entity28 in the first - half with a sweet strike from 18 yards , leaving @entity71 rooted both @entity28 and @entity12 players observe a minute 's silence to mark the centenary of the outbreak of the @entity343			1

@entity57 gave @entity28 the lead early on after sliding in to convert @entity226 's cross
@entity35 was put through on goal for @entity12 shortly after , but his effort was saved by @entity43
@entity61 was sent off for shoving @entity81 in the face after kicking @entity80
@entity178 equalised after *slotting* home at the far post from a corner with six minutes remaining
then @entity14 , on a a substitute , scored the winner in the 90th minute after his free - kick deflected off @entity42
