the founder of @entity1 has set up a new @entity3 organisation for those who feel his old party have become ' racist '			1
professor @entity6 , 66 , hopes the centre - left party , called @entity8 , is a step away from the set - up under @entity11 , which he believes has become ' anti-immigrant and ' anti-intellectual			1
' he also hopes to challenge the @entity14 and has considered opposing @entity15 in his @entity17 seat at the 2015 general election			0
new direction : professor @entity6 in 1993 when he launched the @entity20 @entity1			1
some of the policies the organisation will push include the re-nationalisation of railways and the scrapping of the bedroom tax			0
he also believes many voters in @entity20 want to leave with the @entity28 , but will not side with @entity1 because they are too extreme			1
his criticism of @entity11 's party began after a number of council candidates were exposed for having extreme right - wing links or homophobic views			2
the new party could pose a significant threat to @entity14 as leader @entity15 faces increasing criticism for weak leadership and being vague on policy			0
there are also plans for a candidate to stand against deputy prime minister @entity42 in his @entity44 constituency			0
competition : professor @entity6 thinks @entity1 have become too ' racist ' under the leadership of @entity11 ( left ) and has considered standing against @entity15 in his @entity17 seat at the next general election sked , a lecturer in international history at the @entity51 , told @entity52 he wanted a party dedicated to leaving the @entity28 but was not too right wing			1
' i think the majority of the people in this country want out of the @entity28 , ' said @entity6			1
' they would like a party devoted to the cause , but could n't vote for one that was extremely right wing			0
' they will now be given a serious alternative to the major parties and @entity1			1
' despite plans from @entity67 to renegotiate the terms of @entity20 's membership of the @entity28 , @entity6 believes the @entity71 leader is ' trying to pull the wool over the eyes ' of the country and his party			1
the name @entity8 is based on policies introduced in the @entity78 by president @entity79 in the 1930 's to lift @entity78 out of the @entity80			2
the party 's draft manifesto states tolerance for minorities and is supportive of immigration which it believes is ' fundamental to the growth of an economically prosperous and civilised society '			2
other new deal policies will include the ending of welfare payments for those earning more than Â£ 100,000 a year , oppose the privatisation of @entity94 and scrap the government 's controversial high - speed rail plans			0
it was officially registered as a party last week by the @entity99 and intends to field candidates at the 2015 general election			0
but , in contrast to @entity1 , it will not be standing in @entity105 elections because @entity6 believed it would be ' hypocritical '			2
@entity6 pointed out that when he founded @entity1 , it had very limited financial resources and is ready to raise funds to help boost the new party			1
his first involvement in politics was with the @entity113 in @entity114 but later rejected their pro-european stance			0
in 1993 he stood in two by - elections , one in @entity117 where he was supported by @entity118			0
he came fourth behind the major parties in both elections which prompted the @entity121 ( @entity122 ) to change its name to @entity1			1
last month @entity124 , @entity125 for @entity126 and @entity127 , provoked outrage after referring to countries in @entity130 which received aid from @entity133 ' @entity132 '			0
@entity6 added : ' these are the tired and false representations of a disappointed man			0
' the party , which has been led by @entity11 since 2010 , denies being racist or anti-immigrant			2
a spokesman for the party said : ' @entity6 should be pleased with how well we are doing and the successes of the party he created			2
