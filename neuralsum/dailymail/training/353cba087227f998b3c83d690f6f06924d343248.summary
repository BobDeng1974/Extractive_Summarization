@entity1 expats in @entity2 face a near - total wipe - out of any deposits over £ 85,000 as the full nightmare of the stricken island ’s @entity7 bailout became clear yesterday			1
although it was known that the wealthiest savers would take a large hit from last week ’s € 10 billion ( £ 8.5 billion ) @entity7 rescue deal , the loss is far greater than feared			1
the blow will fall on customers of the country two biggest banks – @entity17 and @entity18			1
false hope ? economists warn the cut may not have much direct effect since banks are not passing on low rates in indebted countries like @entity2 ( above ) that need help the most savers at the @entity17 will see 37.5 per cent of any deposits over £ 85,000 converted into shares in the bank @entity17 savers will see 37.5 per cent of any deposits over € 100,000 ( £ 85,000 ) converted into shares in the bank , with a strong possibility that these will prove worthless			1
another 40 per cent will be repaid only if the bank does well in future , while 22.5 per cent will go into a contingency fund that could be subject to further write - offs			1
@entity18 customers are also reported to be facing the loss of 80 per cent of their deposits above the £ 85,000 limit			1
an early bailout plan – highlighted by @entity44 two weeks ago – would have seen the losses shared across all bank customers , regardless of their balance			1
however , that plan was voted down by the @entity2 parliament , leaving the country in urgent need of a new solution to raise its € 5.8 billion contribution towards the bailout			1
thousands of @entity2 demonstrate to protest against the harsh treatment imposed on @entity2 by the @entity56 earlier this week the deal – which was clinched last monday between @entity2 , the @entity7 and the @entity58 – made clear that richer bank customers would shoulder a much larger bill			1
although it is not known how many of the 60,000 @entity1 expats living on the island have deposits of more than £ 85,000 , it is likely that a considerable number will be caught in the net			1
@entity68 , 48 , who moved to @entity69 , on the south - west coast of the island , six years ago , said he has lost nearly £ 200,000			1
the former farmer , who has two accounts with @entity17 , added : ‘ i had more than € 300,000 in my deposit account and € 20,000 in my current account			1
when i went to the bank the other day i was told the total balance for both is € 100,000			1
‘ they were unable to explain how this had been worked out but indicated i might get some back at a later stage			1
‘ i checked online and it confirmed that the € 20,000 in my current account remains , but that i only have € 80,000 in my savings account			2
it ’s robbery , plain and simple			2
’ @entity18 customers are also reported to be facing the loss of 80 per cent of their deposits above the £ 85,000 limit banks in @entity2 are open for normal business but with strict restrictions on how much money their clients can access , after being shut for nearly two weeks mr @entity68 , from @entity92 , whose wife died two years ago , said he moved to @entity2 believing he was destined for a ‘ happy life of semi-retirement ’			1
‘ our farm in @entity98 was bought by a mining company and i came into a lot of money , ’ he added			2
‘ we moved to @entity2 for the sunshine and easy life but it has turned into a nightmare			2
‘ my big mistake was to move all my money here , but at the time things were very stable			2
most of the @entity108 here had the foresight to move their money in the last few months , but i genuinely thought it would be ok			2
i ’m not sure what the future holds now			2
’ the @entity115 has said it will compensate any of the 3,000 @entity1 service personnel facing @entity117 hit hardest include thousands of wealthy @entity118 who have deposited millions of euros on the stricken island			1
@entity122 , strategist at @entity124 bank @entity123 , said : ‘ these suggested new sacrifices being demanded of better - off depositors sound even worse than we assumed			2
‘ the problems in @entity2 are twofold			2
first , the central bank ignored the huge build - up of debt			2
there was a problem of mismanagement			0
‘ secondly , the @entity2 essentially imposed these tough solutions on themselves and the eurozone rubber - stamped them			0
’ ordinary @entity2 step in the streets to protest against the massive " haircuts " imposed by the @entity7 , the @entity139 and the @entity58 last week markets took fright at suggestions that the @entity2 model could be a blueprint for future bailouts elsewhere in @entity146			0
those with less than £ 85,000 in the bank have also seen themselves hit by the bailout			1
temporary capital controls have been imposed to stop residents taking cash off the island , including capping cash machine withdrawals at € 300 a day			0
at the same time , businesses have been told they will be unable to transfer more than € 5,000 abroad without approval , while no one , including tourists , can leave the island with over € 1,000 in cash			0
meanwhile , the spotlight has now swung to @entity162 , another small member of the single currency in which investors are losing faith			0
last week , the price it had to pay to borrow money jumped sharply as markets began to take account of the risk that the country may default on its debts			0
however , on friday , finance minister @entity175 insisted : ‘ we will need no bailout this year			0
’ for a currency that promised to provide a sure bet on a glorious future , the euro is turning into the biggest theft of people ’s savings in @entity146 since the war			0
@entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 and @entity189 were among the first to be crushed by the fallacy of a one - size - fits - all currency			0
now it is @entity2 ’s turn , and the scale of losses for some savers is eye - watering			0
last week , the latest @entity2 bailout proposals hinted at a 40 per cent levy on all deposits of more than € 100,000 , or £ 85,000			1
this weekend , it emerged that the true cost for those better - off depositors could be much closer to 80 per cent			1
@entity1 expats feature prominently among those who will suffer from an effective confiscation of their assets			0
the euro is setting out to be the biggest theft of people 's savings since the war claims that the victims are shady @entity118 oligarchs have a nasty whiff to them , and even if some of the cash that will be taken is of doubtful provenance , that can not justify the burden now being placed on the tiny island economy			0
smaller savers may not have been hit by a levy on their bank accounts , but they will be swept up in the economic storm that is sure to descend on @entity2 as a result of such draconian measures			0
it ’s tempting to wonder why any troubled eurozone country like @entity2 was ever let into what was obviously a rich man ’s club			0
but that is unfair – the poorer members were welcomed with open arms , with the assurance that the euro would turn them into @entity239 - style economic titans			0
it was like persuading a pauper to join a casino			0
yes , @entity2 let its banking sector balloon wildly and , yes , it is the @entity2 government that has dreamt up some of the more masochistic features of the various bailout plans			0
but all this human sacrifice in the eurozone – austerity , mass unemployment , arbitrary bank account levies – is about saving the euro			0
you wonder how much pain there has to be before someone realises that what must be sacrificed is the euro itself .			0
