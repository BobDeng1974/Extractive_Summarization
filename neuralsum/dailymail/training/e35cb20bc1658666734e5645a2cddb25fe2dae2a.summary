by @entity0 more than 12,000 retired public sector workers enjoy pensions worth ' in excess of £ 50,000 a year ' , a report reveals today			1
of those , nearly 150 have retired on incomes worth more than £ 100,000 a year			2
the research lays bare the pensions enjoyed by high - earning members of the state sector workforce – dubbed @entity12 's ' pensions aristocracy '			1
the study also claims that the true cost of pension promises made to current public sector workers is a massive £ 1,700billion – around £ 600billion higher than the government 's own estimate			1
a report has laid bare the pensions enjoyed by high - earning members of the state sector workforce it is the equivalent of an extra £ 35,000 bill for every tax - paying household in the country with occupants below retirement age			1
the report was written by former @entity31 economist @entity29 , and compiled by the @entity32 , a left - leaning think tank that examines fairness between the generations			1
@entity35 , co-founder of the foundation , said : ' the relationship between those making these promises today and those who will pay later is one - sided			0
' he warns the bill for pensions , which he warned is ' an enormous @entity44 ' , will be ' paid for in the future largely by our children and grandchildren			1
' this is because there is no precise pot of money set aside for the majority of public sector workers ' pensions , such as those in the @entity57 , teachers and civil service			0
instead , it relies on new workers joining the state workforce and paying into their pension to help pay the retirement benefits of those who have retired			0
the report was compiled by former @entity31 economist , now a multimillionaire , @entity29 retired state workers are ' rewarding themselves huge pensions with scant regard to the interests of their younger colleagues , many of whom will be funding their older colleagues ' pensions until 2050 , ' according to the report			1
mr @entity79 added : ' rewarding an older generation at the hidden and unrecognised expense of a younger generation until it is too late is morally indefensible			0
' to get a pension worth £ 100,000 a year , a private sector worker would need to build a pension pot of around £ 2.8million , assuming he or she wants to retire at the age of 65 and have a pension which increases with inflation every year and passes to their spouse if they die first			2
@entity93 , head of corporate research at the financial advisers @entity95 , said : ' few people could ever dream of having a pension of this size			0
' by comparison , the average pension pot is worth just £ 35,000 , and pays out only £ 1,200 a year			2
@entity101 , chief executive of the @entity103 campaign group , said : ' the scale of the public sector pension liability is enormous , much scarier than the government lets on			1
' the situation has rapidly deteriorated over the last decade and will only get worse with an ageing population , meaning our debt mountain will continue to grow			0
' since 1997 , the number of private sector workers with a ' defined benefit ' pension has collapsed from 4.9million to just 1.7million today , according to the @entity115			0
a ' defined benefit ' pension is one which guarantees to pay a certain pension to a worker when he or she retires , such as a final salary pension or a career average pension			0
the @entity123 has also dramatically clamped down on public sector pensions			0
as a result , workers must pay more into their pension and retire at a later age – but still enjoy far more generous pensions than the majority of private sector employees			2
a @entity133 spokesman said : ' the government 's reforms to public service pensions will save £ 430billion over the next 50 years and ensure they are affordable and sustainable in the long - term			1
' reformed public service pensions will remain among the very best available , whilst rebalancing the costs more fairly between employees , employers and the taxpayer			0
