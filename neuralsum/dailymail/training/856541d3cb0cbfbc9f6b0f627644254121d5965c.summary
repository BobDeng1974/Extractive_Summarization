by @entity0 published : 15:20 est , 22 october 2012 updated : 15:23 est , 22 october 2012 yet more doubts have been raised over the authenticity of ' reality television ' show @entity5 after one character revealed she has been divorced , which is rarely allowed in the @entity5 community			1
cast member @entity8 accepts a proposal from @entity10 on the @entity12 show , which depicts the two meeting in @entity14 for the ' first time ' - yet they are believed to already have a child together in real life			1
it has now been claimed that , despite the ' revelation ' on the show , @entity8 left her first husband , @entity22 , to start a relationship with @entity10 in 2010			1
the claims spark yet more trouble for @entity5 , which has repeatedly come under fire for deceiving viewers since its launch more than a month ago			2
@entity12 says the show follows five @entity5 and @entity31 men and women as they leave their communities for the first time and head to @entity14 - yet this story has slowly crumbled			1
it comes in stark contrast to the naive characters portrayed on the show , who stare slack - jawed at @entity58 's towering buildings and pray as they travel by plane ' for the first time '			2
among the characters , @entity8 and @entity10 are portrayed as meeting for the first time on the show - with a possible love match on the cards			1
but , after the show depicts the pair getting closer and @entity10 proposing to @entity8 , she reveals she has been divorced - to his apparent shock			1
' false claims ' : on the show , @entity8 and @entity10 , pictured , claim they have never met before ' falling in love ' : @entity8 had actually left her husband for @entity10 shortly after her marriage in march 2010 ' i have to make a decision between you and , like , being @entity5 , ' he says on the show			1
but a photograph uploaded to a @entity80 page , @entity81 , apparently shows that the pair in fact already have a child together			0
reports and marriage records reveal that @entity8 married @entity22 in march 2010 before divorcing him this past summer , although their relationship apparently broke down much earlier			2
in a message on @entity22 's @entity80 wall in october 2010 , he writes : ' i am tryn 2 figure out why in th world abe schmucker wud want to b a friend on face book afterall he left wht my wife			0
' and while @entity10 claims in the program that he has never partied , police records - and a mug shot - reveal he was arrested for alcohol intoxication in a public place in 2008 , when he was just 18			2
old life : blog reports identified her ex-husband as @entity22 , pictured with his new girlfriend in perhaps the most shocking revelation about the real lives of the characters , @entity106 , another cast member , is divorced from a woman who claims he repeatedly beat her			1
brush with the law : a mug shot of @entity10 from 2008 after he was arrested for being drunk in public public records reveal that 32 - year - old @entity115 , who regularly swears on the show , has three children - two daughters , aged seven and three , and a son , five			1
the children live with their mother , @entity120 , in @entity121			0
the couple married in 2005 and she filed for divorce in 2011 , citing gross neglect of duty , extreme cruelty and incompatibility			0
speaking to @entity128 , @entity120 , who has also left the @entity5 community , called the show ' a fake ' and lambasted @entity12 for perpetuating lies on a family channel about a man accused of repeatedly attacking his wife			1
' the kids and i suffered for years at the hands of this man , ' she said			0
' my family is livid because they took him in and cared for him , now he is doing this ? i 'm not surprised at him			0
what surprised me was @entity12			0
my kids and i watch @entity12			0
they are supposed to be a family channel			0
for them to do this is appalling			0
' police reports showed she called authorities on at least eight occasions and @entity106 was arrested for domestic violence in 2005			2
she said that his violence eventually led to their break up			0
' reality ' tv ? @entity12 's show @entity5 has come under fire for its false claims about its characters ' pasts on one occasion , he punched her in the stomach while she was pregnant , a police report notes			1
she said that @entity12 offered her $ 10,00 to stay quiet on the incidents , which @entity12 denies			0
she added that , while @entity106 is shown getting a large arm tattoo in @entity5 , he has in fact had it for years - and it bears the names of his three children			1
@entity106 was also reportedly away from his @entity5 community for up to 14 years and is pictured on social networking sites surrounded by beer cans			1
@entity181 , who claims he lived with @entity106 for a year and a half , added : ' i 've known him for years			2
i let him move in because he was living out of his truck and had no place else to go			0
' and the other cast members apparently were holding back some information , too			1
on the show : @entity106 says he is desperate to break away from his @entity5 community on the show - but has reportedly already spent 14 years away past : photographs from an old @entity193 page show @entity106 looking decidedly un-amish @entity12 has previously admitted that @entity194 , who is billed as an @entity5 bishop 's daughter and aspiring model , has been arrested for a @entity198 , but now new information paints an even more rebellious picture			1
as revealed on a @entity80 page , , she has previously submitted images to modeling agencies - which is at odds with the @entity5 stance against photographs , believing they represent ' vanity ' which they deem a sin			2
online records show that @entity194 posted a photograph on @entity212 to enter a @entity213 in 2010 - years before she claimed she gave up her @entity5 life to move to the city			1
this internet savvy version of @entity194 is a far cry from an episode of @entity5 in which she is overwhelmed by new technology and struggles to work an elevator			2
revealed : @entity106 's wife , @entity120 , spoke to @entity128 about how @entity106 repeatedly attacked her wild : pictures also show @entity106 , left , surrounded by friends swigging from beer cans the final character , @entity227 , a 25 - year - old from an @entity229 and @entity230 family who was adopted into the faith , is pictured on @entity80 kissing a man while she wears skimpy clothing			1
she was reportedly married in 2009 and has not been a practicing @entity31 for years , friends claim , suggesting this is not the ' first time ' she has left the community			0
she is pictured on her wedding day in a ceremony that is not traditionally mennonite			0
the apparent betrayal by the creators of @entity5 is documented on a @entity80 page , breaking @entity244 , on which people who claim to know the cast have vented their anger			1
scores of people have also uploaded photographs showing the cast in their ' real ' lives			2
@entity252 , a former @entity5 who appeared on a separate show , @entity255 , lambasted the show for its dishonesty			1
dark pasts : @entity12 had previously admitted that @entity194 , pictured left on the show , was arrested for @entity198 , right aspiring model : a photo of @entity194 has been found online from a smiling contest in 2010 ' this show is doing exactly opposite of what i stand for , ' he wrote on his blog			0
' the fakeness of these characters supposedly just leaving the community , when in fact , they have been out for many years			0
' the fact that they act like things like microwaves and iphones are something strange , when indeed , they have owned them for years themselves , and the disrespect they show towards the @entity5			1
' i would never stoop to doing a show like this , and really wish no one else would have done it either			0
' in response to the outrage , @entity12 has said it will address the revelations in time			0
' there is a lot of information floating around about the group featured on @entity5			2
much of it is not true , but some of it is - and is addressed in upcoming episodes , ' @entity12 told @entity295			0
half truths : @entity227 , a @entity31 , was reportedly married in 2009 - which is not mentioned on the show double life : but @entity80 photos apparently show her kissing a man and wearing skimpy clothes keeping it quiet : an acquaintance of @entity227 's uploaded this picture of her on her wedding day ' our @entity5 and @entity31 producers that we hired introduced us to @entity5 and @entity31 men and women who were already determined to leave			2
they had already made the decision to go out and see the world , with or without us			0
they courageously allowed us to follow them on this journey			0
' despite these protestations , @entity12 has adjusted the description of the show on its website			0
it was previously billed as ' four @entity5 and one @entity31 , breaking away from their faith and traveling to @entity14 for the first time '			1
now the @entity12 site explains : ' @entity5 offers an unprecedented look into a rarely seen world , following four @entity5 people and one @entity31 as they forgo horses and buggies for @entity14 's taxis and subways ' - taking out any reference to ' first time ' in @entity14			1

doubts over honesty of show following lives of @entity5 in @entity14
two cast members , @entity10 and @entity8 , ' have a child together '
@entity106 ' is divorced from wife after abusing her and has three kids '
