her neighbour ’s leylandii hedge stands 40ft tall and , says @entity3 , has left parts of her garden in deep shade			1
what ’s more , it now seems likely to remain that way			0
despite a 35 - year fight to get the trees cut down to size , the council has ruled they can stay			1
it is the final defeat in a battle that involved two generations of mrs @entity3 ’s family			1
it kicked off 35 years ago when mrs @entity3 ’s aunt found her vegetable patch at the property would not grow anything worth eating because of the leylandii			1
a row between neighbours over a 40ft high leylandii hedge ( pictured ) has finally come to and end after 35 years the battle between the neighbouring properties started in 1980 when the owner planted a vegetable patch which withered and died in the shade of her neighbour 's massive hedge then , 23 years ago , single mother mrs @entity3 bought the house and asked her neighbour @entity36 to trim the hedge			1
she claims mrs @entity36 refused and declared : ‘ i would rather move than touch these trees			2
’ the dispute rumbled on , with mrs @entity3 , 54 , claiming that the trees knocked £ 20,000 off the value of her property			1
she sensed an opportunity , however , with the passing of the @entity45 in @entity46 in 2013 which allows local authorities to take action in such cases			0
@entity50 has finally ruled that the hedge can stay , despite claims it has knocked £ 20,000 off the value of neighbour @entity3 's house ( pictured ) the situation came to a head in 2008 , when a 65ft section of hedge is said to have fallen and demolished a neighbour 's garden shed @entity3 ( pictured ) also claims other neighbours have had to move their children from their bedrooms at night for fear of the falling branches but her council has ruled that mrs @entity36 can keep the hedge , although it has to be cut to 20ft			1
mrs @entity3 said the ruling made ‘ no difference ’			2
the @entity45 2013 allows neighbours to complain to the council when a hedgerow blocks sunlight from reaching their garden			1
complainants and the hedge 's owner are encouraged to resolve the issue between themselves and councils should only be called in to help as a last resort			0
because the effect the hedge has is not always clear , disputes can last for years before an agreement can be reached			0
the local authority can either issue a high hedge notice , which orders owners to cut the hedge back , or decide not to act			1
the local authority can not make any orders about the roots of the hedge			0
she added : ‘ the whole situation is appalling – the legislation is about giving people the right to sunlight			0
‘ it ’s a disgrace and i feel extremely let down			0
’ the neighbour refused to comment			0
mrs @entity3 ’s only option is the courts which she can not afford to do			2
over the years she had used the mediation services of @entity103 to try to resolve the issue			2
the situation came to a head in 2008 , when she claims a 65ft section of hedge fell , demolishing a neighbour ’s garden shed			2
following the introduction of the @entity45 , @entity50 found in her favour but the neighbour appealed and won the 20ft ruling			0
dr @entity115 , of @entity116 , a group which demands the end of ‘ high hedge tyranny ’ , said that the council ’s decision was ‘ pretty crazy ’			0
a council spokesman said the decision was made ‘ after carrying out a site inspection and considering all the evidence ’			0
mrs @entity3 said her aunt , now 87 , had moved to @entity128 to enjoy ‘ sunshine and gardening ’			2
ms @entity3 called in @entity103 to try to solve the quarrel , but no solution could be found and the feud continued the council ruled that the hedge should be cut to about 20ft , a height which ms @entity3 claims will still block most of her sunlight			1

@entity3 *wanted* her neighbours to chop down their huge hedge
she claims the 40ft leylandii was blocking sunlight from reaching her home
feud started in 1980 when it blocked light from reaching a vegetable patch
@entity103 finally rules that the hedge can stay - but must be cut back to 20ft
