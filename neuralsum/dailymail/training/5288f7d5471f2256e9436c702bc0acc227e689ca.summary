by @entity1 reporter published : 14:47 est , 5 may 2013 updated : 10:33 est , 7 may 2013 thousands of students descended on a @entity4 park to celebrate an annual drinking party , despite being warned by their university colleges			1
an estimated 2,000 @entity9 students took part in the ‘ @entity12 ’ tradition , playing boozy games and enjoying semi-dressed antics in front of shocked families on @entity17			1
a number of colleges emailed students last week urging them to ‘ find a more fruitful way ’ of spending their day than heading to the city centre park for the annual gathering			1
geared up : @entity9 students attend the annual @entity12 sunday on @entity17 in the city centre they warned that any students ‘ committing an offence ’ would be subject to the disciplinary rules of their respective college and the @entity9 and to ‘ appropriate police action ’			1
@entity12 is seen as the birth of the drinking parties for the summer term which ends with the notorious after - exams party , suicide sunday , in june			1
with the sun out for the day , students started filling up the park at around midday wearing their university blazers and carrying bucket loads of alcohol			2
an afternoon of drinking games followed , including , wrestling and undergraduates at the prestigious institution soaking each other with water pistols and bottles of wine just feet away from where children were playing			2
the dress code depended on allegiance , with some drinking societies wearing @entity56 headdresses , while others wore blazers or togas			0
carry on : as the afternoon went on the boozy games began on the green here come the girls : a group of female students play up for the camera as they enjoy the annual event , traditionally held on the first may bank holiday sunday lads : tourists and locals , including many with children , were subjected to views of students fighting , stripping off and lathering on the sun cream a lot of the students , both male and female , could barely stand by the end of the afternoon and some hurled abuse at press photographers			1
caesarian sunday historically takes place at @entity17 in @entity4 ’s city centre , on the first bank holiday of the summer term			1
it is said to have started when a member of the @entity89 ’s @entity88 stole a bottle of @entity91 ’s from a member of the @entity93			0
the bottle was then thrown at the @entity95 in a challenge to fight			2
it is now tradition that the president of @entity101 ’s drinking society downs a bottle of @entity91 ’s and invites the @entity104 drinking society to fight			0
but this year for the first time in 80 years the traditional fight did not take place after students were warned by their colleges to behave			0
giddy - up ! members of a @entity4 drinking society take some female students for a ride cream on : two young men take part in a drinking game which involves smearing whipped cream on their bodies and other participants removing it with their mouths enjoying the sun : the warm weather allowed for drinking until late in the afternoon - for those still able professors at @entity104 had even tried to persuade the drinking societies to hold their traditional bash on its grounds , away from the public eye			1
but their attempts failed because the undergraduates said they did not want to drink under supervision			0
last week @entity133 , a @entity134 fellow and a former @entity135 , said last year 's event was ‘ deeply regrettable and embarrassing ’ and ‘ very unhelpful to the university ’			0
‘ it 's disappointing the fight could n't go ahead as it happens every year , but both @entity101 and @entity134 drinking societies were warned to keep things under control this year , ’ said one student who did not want to be named			2
‘ there was an opportunity to have the event on university grounds but many felt it would n't be the same			0
‘ this is the last day we have to relax before revision and exams , so it 's a chance to let off steam			0

@entity9 students defy @entity9 's *request* and enjoy @entity95 sunday
around 2,000 took part in annual drinking party in @entity17 , @entity4
' @entity95 sunday ' marks the beginning of the ' summer term parties '
