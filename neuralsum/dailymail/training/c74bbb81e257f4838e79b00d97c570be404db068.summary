how would @entity0 defend this humiliating result ? all eyes and ears were fixed on the @entity4 as he strode into the @entity5 at the @entity6 for his post-match press conference			1
the room certainly is n't what @entity9 is used to			2
small , tight - and adjacent to a gym weights room			1
@entity0 was left frustrated after @entity13 's draw with @entity14 @entity9 watches on while @entity13 face @entity15 on friday night in the @entity16 click here to read @entity19 's report from the @entity6 as @entity13 and @entity14 drew 0 - 0 in their @entity16 clash			1
he 's certainly spoken in plusher surroundings			2
but that summed up @entity13 's night			1
they are n't used to results like this			2
so why were a side that included @entity27 and @entity28 unable to break down a side playing three levels below them in the @entity33 football spectrum ? @entity9 provided a bullish response : ' every aspect of this match was against us			1
' what do i mean ? we have to come here , the pitch is n't so good - that can influence the style you play			1
' the opponents always give a lot more than they normally give and defending is always easier than attacking			2
' we knew in advance everything would be against us - but you have to survive			2
' and then you have seen the referee - its always the same			2
everywhere i have coached these games , and i have coached them with other clubs , it 's always the same			2
' what was wrong with the referee ? you can give your own opinion , i ca n't give mine			2
' @entity9 walks from the pitch at full time frustrated after his side drew 0 - 0 against @entity14 @entity28 struggled to impress for @entity13 against @entity14 that could well be because there was nothing wrong with referee @entity65 's performance			1
@entity9 's comments were , of course , a deliberate ploy to deflect attention away from his side 's inept display			1
had he heard some of the views of @entity13 supporters leaving the @entity6 following the final whistle , then @entity9 may have been harsher on his charges			1
the @entity4 did n't let his players off the hook completely , though			0
' we made the same mistakes as we did against @entity80 and @entity81 in that we played in the same style as the opponent and that was our error			0
' in the second half we played much better , we played along the floor			0
' so it 's a pity , again , that we had to wait till half time , but in the second half i was pleased , we did n't score but i have to give credit to @entity15			1
' they played very well and were well organised , with heart , and they fought until the end			0
' we could have scored but now we have an extra match , we are still in the cup and that 's the most important thing			0
' i have seen a lot of times that big clubs lose against such opponents			0
' @entity27 had a another frustrating night in a @entity13 shirt against @entity15 @entity102 ( left ) of @entity14 tackles @entity103 of @entity13 and then came the perennial questions about his choice of formation			1
he knew it was coming too , as a wry smile came across @entity9 's face			0
@entity13 reverted to a flat back four after starting last weekend 's win over @entity81 with three - at - the back			1
@entity9 said : ' do you watch our games ? against @entity80 , we played the other system and in the second half we played 4 - 4 - 2 , ' said the @entity13 boss			1
' so when it ’s not going well i change , and we won 2 - 0			1
@entity81 was the same , we played the other system and changed to 4 - 4 - 2 ( and won )			1
' we created more chances and so you are more convinced			0
i know the statistics of the other performances and you can see we created more chances			0
' but it ’s not only the system , it ’s the performance of the system			2
' there was a much more enthusiastic mood during @entity9 's counterpart , @entity132 's , press conference			0
money is , perhaps , an appropriate name for last night			0
his side 's heroics could earn @entity15 upwards of £ 1.7million from their replay at @entity140 the week after next			1
@entity14 boss @entity132 watching on during his side 's draw against @entity13 man - of - the - match @entity143 and team - mate @entity144 celebrating at full time ' it 's going to be a massive amount of money , i ca n't think about to be honest , ' said @entity132			1
' i 'm sure the chairman would n't have been happy if we scored			0
i 've just said in the dressing room we are going to @entity140 , so who cares what happens			0
' enjoy soak it in , 75,000 people , whatever happens happens			0
it ’s hard to put into words how proud we are			0
' this club has been in the doldrums with 10 years out of the @entity161 , and now we ’re taking everybody back to @entity140			0
' in the second half we showed great character and courage , but in the first half we were good and carried a threat			0
' we had a couple of good set pieces and could n’t quite produce the final touch			0
' i must put in a special word for the goalkeeper and two centre halves , who were terrific			0
' we spent a lot of time before kick - off making them aware who the players were , giving them a good look at the @entity13 badge			1
' i told them to stick their chests out , and go out and play - not to be fazed			2

@entity27 and @entity28 unable to break down @entity15
@entity13 held to 0 - 0 draw in fourth round of @entity16
