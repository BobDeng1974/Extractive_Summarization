@entity10 scientists created @entity11 to assist in dangerous situations from a nuclear meltdown to the aftermath of a bomb explosion so that humans no longer need to risk their lives in such perilous environments			1
however , in the meantime , the machine is competing in @entity22 ’s @entity21 in @entity23 and has got through to the finals			1
two of its arms have three fingers to grip objects			0
the robot measures 5ft 5in ( 1.64m ) when it is standing up and weighs 238lb ( 108kg )			1
it has 28 degrees - of freedom for mobility and manipulation and folds into a relatively small volume			0
humans control the robot remotely using a normal computer monitor , keyboard and mouse			2
the robot is designed to assist in dangerous situations such as nuclear meltdowns and the aftermath of bomb blasts			1
it runs on batteries , which is useful in areas that have lost mains power			0
@entity11 was built by @entity62 's @entity61 and @entity63 engineers with the intention of being stable and flexible , rather than fast			1
the robot has four dexterous arms that bend in an unusual way to support its weight , lift objects , open doors and allow the machine to walk along like a spider			0
it can bend them beneath itself to adopt a type of yogic pose			0
two of the arms have three fingers to grip objects and open doors , which are essential skills in an emergency , as well as in the trials			0
to gain a place in the final , the robot battled 15 other teams to complete tasks including climbing ladders , clambering over obstacles , turning wheels and opening doors			2
other more fiddly challenges include removing debris , connecting a fire hose to a tap and breaking through a wall , as well as driving an emergency vehicle , as it is envisioned these robots could go to places too dangerous for humans			2

it is designed for stability , rather than rapid movement , which makes it more robust and reliable			0
the @entity22 robotics challenge comprises eight tasks : driving a vehicle , negotiating tricky terrain , climbing a ladder , moving debris , opening a door , knocking though a wall , turning a valve and connecting a hose the robot has four dexterous arms that bend in an unusual way to support its weight , lift objects , open doors and allow the machine to walk along like a spider			1

the robot came fifth in @entity22 ’s competition - which was conceived following the nuclear meltdown in @entity159 , @entity160 - and was beaten by robots that looked more human in appearance			1

here , humans guide the robot through a series of doors , which it has to open the robo - ape is competing in @entity22 's @entity21 in @entity23 and has got through to the finals by completing tasks such as removing debris from doorways ( pictured ) the highest scoring robot – with 27 points compared to @entity179 ’s 14 – is called @entity180 and was built by a team in @entity182 , @entity160			1
the bipedal robot measures one - and - a - half metres tall and walks like a human and using its actuator , walking and stabilisation systems			2
the winning team will receive a $ 2million prize			0

@entity10 scientists created @entity11 to assist in dangerous situations from a nuclear meltdown to the aftermath of a bomb explosion
robot is through to the finals of @entity22 's @entity21 in @entity23 , where it had to clamber over obstacles , remove debris and even drive a car
@entity11 was built by engineers at @entity61 and @entity63 and measures *1.64metres* when it is standing on two legs and not *crawling* along
