by @entity0 he may just be nine months old , but @entity2 presented his hosts down under with something of a conundrum – what do you get the boy who has everything ? well if his first haul of gifts is anything to go by , then a customised skateboard and a possum fur cloak ought to do the trick			0
the third in line to the throne has been showered with gifts from officials and adoring members of the public in both @entity22 and @entity23			1
one of many : the baby prince holds a toy @entity27 given to him while visiting @entity28 earlier this week			0
it , along with hundreds of others , will be lovingly shipped back to the @entity31 they range from his own amphibious vehicle to a full - sized surf board , and his parents have been particularly delighted by his mountain of cuddly toys			1
the @entity39 revealed in a speech that his son ’s favourite gift was a life - sized wombat given to him by the @entity22 governor - general – which @entity2 has taken to ‘ chewing lovingly ’			1
that very same wombat was seen being carefully loaded on to the family ’s plane at @entity49 yesterday , as @entity2 ’s inaugural royal tour drew to a close			1
bags of presents – several hundred in all – were also stuffed in the overhead luggage compartment of the @entity57 jet			0
but aides have been forced to arrange for some of the larger items to be shipped back home to @entity62			2
strict regulations concerning gifts were brought in a decade ago after it emerged that prince @entity66 had pocketed £ 23,000 from selling valuables he had received from wealthy benefactors			2
members of the @entity70 are now barred from selling or exchanging their gifts			0
each one must be consumed by the royal , displayed in a royal residence or stored for future use – although low - value items can be given to charity or even destroyed			2
now @entity2 has begun a collection all of his own , which will be published in the list of official gifts next year .			0
