ten pounds might seem a little pricey for a tube of toothpaste			2
however , in an era of the £ 60 smart toothbrush and research suggesting a @entity8 smile is key to getting a good job , it could be a price worth paying			1
@entity10 has unveiled a new toothpaste and serum it claims can regenerate 82per cent of tooth enamel after just three days of use			1
the new @entity15 contains calcium silicate and sodium phosphate , which effectively re-builds a new layer of white enamel on the teeth its new @entity15 contains calcium silicate and sodium phosphate , which effectively re-builds a new layer of white enamel on the teeth			1
the company is presenting the toothpaste as a beauty product that will sit alongside expensive age - defying creams and potions			2
the system helps to form a fresh supply of minerals which wrap and integrate in to the surface of the teeth			2
the technology appears to work much like re-plastering a wall , filling any microscopic holes caused by fizzy drinks or sugary foods to leave a strong , smooth finish			1
the company claims this has the effect of restoring teeth to their original whiteness while making them much stronger , which means they are less likely to develop cavities			1
@entity10 says the technology requires the use of a ‘ @entity54 ’ treatment , which costs another £ 30 , once a month and is applied using two custom - fit mouth trays			1
toothpaste manufacturers are constantly looking for new science , pack designs or marketing initiatives to make it appear new , exciting and able to command a higher price			2
the company claims that test tube experiments have proved it can restore 82per cent of tooth enamel after three days @entity66 sales are estimated at more than £ 400million a year , while the global market is put at around £ 8billion , which delivers rich pickings to global brands like @entity71 and @entity72			1
@entity10 launched the new product yesterday at @entity74 in a bid to play up its beauty product credentials - and it will be going in to the boots chain from june 11			1
research expert at @entity10 , @entity79 , who developed the science behind the toothpaste , said : ‘ it is not generally understood that 80 per cent of common teeth problems , such as cavities and yellowing , can be caused by acid attacks and enamel erosion			1
‘ the erosion process happens to everyone , at all ages , day after day and is caused by common items such as carbonated drinks , fruit and vegetables , juices and wine			1
‘ the problem is that when enamel – the outermost protective layer of our teeth – is lost , our body can not regenerate it			1
‘ this product is the world ’s first system able to reverse the early , invisible stages of this erosion process and regenerate enamel with exactly the same mineral tooth enamel is made of			1
’ the two key ingredients in the toothpaste are calcium silicate and sodium phosphate			2
calcium silicate is most commonly derived from limestone and is used heavily in the production of building materials such as cement			0
it is also found in table salt and used as an antacid to treat heartburn			0
sodium phosphate is a term for a variety of salts used in processed food to control acid levels and help soften bread			0
they feature in medicines such as treatments for constipation			0
the technology is the result of work at the @entity10 research and development laboratory at @entity138 , on @entity139 , as well as teams in @entity141 and @entity142			1
it was developed in collaboration with dental experts from @entity146 and the underlying science is due to be published in the @entity148			0
the company claims that test tube experiments have proved it can restore 82per cent of tooth enamel after three days			1
as a result , teeth are said to be three times stronger			0
however , the company faces an uphill struggle to convince a sceptical public that @entity15 is any better than cheaper , rival products which claim to have a similar effect			1
for example , @entity161 toothpaste , which costs £ 4.49 , promotes itself on the basis it is possible to treat the pain of sensitive teeth by repairing vulnerable areas of tooth enamel with a formula that includes calcium and phosphate			2
earlier this week , a leading @entity66 social scientist said the state of a person ’s teeth , rather than their education , is becomingly increasingly important in terms of determining their job prospects and social status			0
@entity180 argued that bad teeth and being overweight are becoming the new benchmarks of inequality			0
he suggested those with bad teeth are given a lower chance of success because they are denied certain entry - level jobs			0
he said : ‘ that ’s kind of the way we ’re moving as the gap between the fit and the unfit grows			0
the teeth thing and the obesity problems are the same : they are symptoms of the same set of inferences that are being drawn			0
@entity180 suggested those with bad teeth have a lower chance of success because they are denied certain jobs			0
nowadays many , particularly celebrities like @entity205 , get work done on their teeth ‘ i think those kinds of physical characteristics - that ’s completely the next wave of discrimination			0
’ it is evident that people in the public eye increasingly feel under pressure to have a perfect white smile , which is permeating through the rest of the population			0
a poll conducted last year by @entity222 also found that people see whiter teeth as an indication of wealth			0
the survey showed that people with whiter teeth were thought to earn £ 10,000 more on average than they actually did			2
sparkling teeth also made them look up to five years younger and improved their employment potential by 10 per cent , results showed			2
@entity233 from the @entity234 has identified a noticeable gap between middle - class teenagers , whose parents are able to afford to have braces , and others who can not .			0

fills in microscopic holes made by fizzy drinks or sugary foods
