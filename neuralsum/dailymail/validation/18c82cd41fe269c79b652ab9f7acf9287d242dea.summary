as the clock to 2016 ticks down , @entity0 are fretful that @entity3 and her team are n't prepared for the rigors of a bruising presidential contest based on their botched response to what is now being called ' email-gate			1
' @entity3 is widely expected to launch her presidential bid in the next several weeks			0
other than vice president @entity12 and @entity14 sen. @entity13 , who has adamantly said she 's not running , @entity3 is seen as the only @entity15 with enough credibility and name id to weather a national campaign			1
while many democrats continue to stand with @entity3 , others are questioning the wisdom of the party 's approach as it seeks to win the @entity24 for a third consecutive time			1
' i want @entity0 to win			0
' @entity0 have never been particularly comfortable with handing @entity3 the party 's nomination			2
buying into that notion of ' inevitability ' is how the former @entity50 senator lost her 2008 bid to @entity52 , and it could lead to defeat for the party at the polls next november			0
but if not @entity3 , then who ? ' there is no one else — she ’s the whole plan , ' @entity57 , a high - dollar @entity0 fundraiser based out of @entity50 told the @entity44			1
' she is by far the most experienced and qualified person we could possibly nominate			0
not even on the horizon but on the far horizon			0
' @entity3 has been hit hard throughout the last two weeks from politicians and pundits all across the political spectrum for her use of a private email system while serving as secretary of state			2
republicans , and @entity0 who worry about @entity3 's viability as a candidate , contend that the calculated move to avoid using an email address directly registered to the federal government will intensify the public perception that @entity3 and her husband , @entity80 , are secretive and therefore potentially untrustworthy			1
@entity3 has said that she sent the @entity82 copies of all her work - related emails , but there 's no way to verify her statements , as she retains the rights to both her inbox and the computer server she ran them through			1
and the @entity91 said on thursday that the federal government neither reviewed @entity3 's personal email nor was it ' particularly interested ' in doing so to make sure she had n't tossed out anything of importance			1
if not @entity3 , then who ? : while many democrats continue to stand with the former secretary of state , others are questioning the wisdom of the party 's approach as it seeks to win the @entity24 for a third consecutive time still a candidate - in - waiting , @entity3 had to tackle the controversy over her emails this week with limited resources			1
she held a press conference to address the matter on tuesday at the @entity113 ' headquarters in @entity50 after a speech , allowing her to push much of the advance work onto the venue 's staff and off her small band of aides			0
the former secretary of state has already built a network of campaign staff , but they , like her , must continue to linger in the wings until @entity3 's candidacy becomes official			1
that will reportedly happen sometime in april , as early as the first day of the month , according to a report in the @entity127 this week			0
the gap in staffing helped cripple @entity3 's ability to strike back in real time to verbal assaults on her character throughout the last two weeks as fury over her email practices reached its peak			1
@entity146 chairman @entity145 , like - minded @entity91 republicans and not - yet - announced @entity141 presidential contenders , who are using their leadership pacs as cover until they declare their own candidacies , pounced on the weakness and flooded the media with statements attacking @entity3			2
' given @entity82 's delay in disclosing the fact @entity3 exclusively used personal email to conduct @entity82 business , there is no way to accept @entity82 's or secretary @entity3 's certification she has turned over all documents that rightfully belong to the @entity42 people , ' he said in a statement on tuesday after hew news conference			1
then - senator @entity3 is pictured here at a rally at @entity163 in @entity164 during her 2008 campaign for president			2
she is expected her announce her 2016 candidacy in the next few weeks @entity169 chairman @entity168 , who took the gavel from @entity172 rep. @entity171 in january , wednesday that in light of the recent developments , @entity173 would open a new investigation into @entity3 , having already concluded its review of the 2012 terrorist strike on the @entity42 consulate in @entity180 , @entity181 , before the current session of @entity183			2
@entity168 believes @entity3 may have violated the @entity184 with her conduct - an offense that would fall under his committee 's jurisdiction			2
' i ’d rather not have to subpoena her , but if she ’s fully cooperative there would n’t be a need , ' he told the @entity194			0
campaign staff or no campaign staff , @entity0 heavy - weights have said that @entity3 should have publicly reacted to the email crisis much quicker			1
' had this story been responded to in two or three days instead of in eight days , it would not be as big , ' president @entity52 's first @entity91 press secretary @entity199 , told the @entity202			0
' they are the ones who put air in this balloon in a way that was not necessary at all			0
. it ’s clear they lack an apparatus			0
she ’s a candidate without a campaign			0
