by @entity0 published : 19:48 est , 28 november 2013 @entity2 : 19:48 est , 28 november 2013 secret documents released today reveal the full extent to which @entity5 systematically destroyed files relating to colonial crimes committed in the final years of the @entity9 empire			1
files published by the @entity11 at @entity12 tell how administration staff in @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 ‘ cleansed ’ so - called dirty documents			1
material which could ‘ embarrass @entity19 ’ was burnt , dumped in rivers or discreetly flown to @entity9 to stop it falling into the hands of post-independence regimes			1
inmates : @entity25 's , prisoners captured by the @entity9 sitting with hands on top of their heads today ’s declassified documents are the eighth and final batch of 8,800 files from 37 former colonies held in a secret @entity35 archive at @entity36 , @entity37			1
they should have been made available to the public , but were kept hidden			0
the existence of the archive only emerged last year , when a group of @entity14 who were detained and tortured during the @entity25 in the 1950s sued the @entity9 government , which finally agreed to release the files			1
the latest batch contains scant detail of any atrocities committed – implying that the majority of the damning papers have been destroyed			0
among them are thought to be records of the torture and murder of @entity25 insurgents detained by @entity9 colonial authorities , the alleged massacre of 24 unarmed villagers in @entity16 by soldiers of the @entity54 in 1948 and sensitive documents kept by colonial authorities in @entity62 , where the army ’s @entity63 operated a secret torture centre in the 1960s			2
crimes : @entity25 suspects being led away for questioning by police in 1952 the destruction of this material was a huge undertaking , and in @entity15 was codenamed @entity74			0
the documents make reference to ‘ clean ’ and ‘ dirty ’ files – presumably a reference to the information included in them			1
officials were told that ‘ emphasis is placed upon destruction ’ , and no trace of either the documents or their incineration should remain			0
colonial officials in @entity14 were told : ‘ it is permissible , as an alternative to destruction by fire , for documents to be packed in weighted crates and dumped in very deep and current - free water at maximum practicable distance from the coast			2
’ and in @entity15 , an official effectively excluded anyone who was not white from being involved in the destruction of certain documents			0
he wrote : ‘ steps are being taken to ensure that such papers are only seen and handled by @entity103 who are @entity9 subjects of @entity106 descent			2
’ the files are available to the public from today in the reading rooms at @entity11 .			0

material which could ‘ embarrass @entity19 ’ was burnt
others were thrown into rivers or *discretely* flown back to @entity5
files disposed of to stop post-independence regimes *obtaining* them
existence of archive was only revealed last year when a group of tortured @entity14 prisoners sued the @entity9 government
