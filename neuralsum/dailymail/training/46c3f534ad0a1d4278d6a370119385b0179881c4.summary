the @entity2 - led international military coalition had earlier said four of its service members were killed in the south , and a military official confirmed all were @entity2 killed by an ' improvised explosive device ' today			2
their deaths bring the toll among foreign forces to 132 this year , of which 102 are from the @entity2			0
@entity16 : more than 20 presidential candidates have registered for @entity3 's first independent election next year at least 2,146 members of the @entity2 military have died in @entity3 as a result of the @entity2 - led invasion of @entity3 in late 2001 , according to an @entity24 count			1
they are part of a total of nearly 3,390 coalition forces that have died during the conflict			0

that number is expected to be halved by february , with @entity2 numbers going down to about 31,000			0
next year 's elections for the country 's top office vote will help determine the success or failure of all those years of @entity2 - led military and political intervention in the country			1
the news comes as a slew of political heavyweights , along with the @entity3 president 's brother and a number of former warlords , registered their presidential candidacy			1
the critical april 5 vote could determine the future course of the country and the level of foreign involvement in @entity3 after 12 years of war			1
contender : @entity3 president @entity71 's brother , @entity70 ( pictured ) , has registered his candidacy in next year 's presidential election the candidacies ended weeks of speculation over who will aspire to replace president @entity71 , who has essentially run the country since the october 7 , 2001 invasion that ousted the @entity80			1
@entity71 is not entitled to run for a third consecutive term , but is expected to back at least one of the candidates - his former foreign minister @entity82 , despite the fact that his businessman brother @entity85 is also running for president			1
the contenders are a mix of @entity3 's past and current power players , including some warlords with a tainted history , a couple of technocrats and some complete political outsiders			2
all the candidates have tried to shape tickets that attempt to unify an ethnically fractious political scene marked by patronage and alliances among the elite - a group who can marshal votes among the country 's various ethnic groups			1
the population of 31 million is roughly 42 percent @entity107 , 27 percent @entity108 , nine per cent @entity109 , and nine per cent @entity110 along with other , smaller factions			0

to run , candidates must have at least 100,000 signatures from all 34 of @entity3 's provinces			1
by the end of the day and after a mad scramble by candidates and hundreds of supporters and heavily armed bodyguards , about 20 presidential candidates had registered for the first independent vote organized by @entity3 without direct foreign assistance			1
top contenders include former foreign minister @entity129 , who was the runner up to president @entity71 in the 2009 elections and dropped out just ahead of a runoff vote following allegations of massive fraud in the first round			1
out of the race : @entity3 president @entity71 is not allowed to run for a third consecutive term @entity138 , a @entity107 former finance minister who oversaw the transition of security from foreign forces to the @entity3 army and police			1
he weighed in with support from two of @entity3 's ethnic groups			2
his choices for vice president are gen. @entity149 , a former warlord who is thought to control the majority of the @entity110 vote and @entity152 , a former justice minister who has the support of former @entity109 warlord and vice president @entity155			0
@entity138 ran and lost in the 2009 elections			0
two former @entity3 warlords are sharing a ticket , one for president , the other for vice president			0
they are @entity161 , an influential @entity107 lawmaker and religious scholar , who is running for president along with former energy and water minister @entity164 , a @entity108			0
@entity82 , a @entity107 , is running with @entity169 , the brother of @entity170 , the @entity168 commander killed in an @entity172 suicide bombing two days before sept. 11 , 2001			0

@entity71 's brother is also running with @entity181 , an @entity110 who was minister of mines , and @entity183 , who was a @entity109 member of parliament			1
the registration came on the eve of the 12th anniversary of the invasion , which led to an insurgency that shows no signs of abatement and a war that has become largely forgotten in the @entity2 and among its coalition allies , despite continued casualties suffered by their forces on the ground			0
billions of dollars in funds pledged to @entity3 are tied to the government 's holding transparent and credible elections , a challenge in a country rife with patronage and corruption and a resilient @entity80 insurgency			2
the @entity80 have asked people not to vote and do not recognize the election process .			0
