ancient marine algae fossils may provide clues about how today ’s microscopic oceanic organisms will respond to climate change			1
warming waters affected the growth and skeletal structure of ancient algae , and scientists hope the findings will deepen their understanding of how life will adapt as @entity13 's temperature rises			1
@entity14 , a type of marine algae , are prolific in the ocean today and have been for millions of years			1
researchers found that warming waters affected the growth and skeletal structure of ancient algae			1
this image shows a scanning electron micrograph of fossil coccolithophore species , @entity22			0
the fossil is from @entity25 and is around 56 million years old the single - celled plankton produce calcite skeletons that are preserved in abundance in seafloor sediments after they die			1
although they are microscopic , their numbers makes them key contributors to marine ecosystems and the global carbon cycle			0
for instance , a build up of skeletons contribute to massive structures such as the @entity40			0
a study by the @entity42 has revealed that the growth of coccolithophores is stunted as oceans become more acidic , because of an increase in atmospheric carbon monoxide			1
researchers did not look at the number of algae that may have been affected , so can not deduce whether changes in their size due to climate change , did , or may , have had an impact on the oceanic food chain			1
the study , published in @entity57 , looked at preserved fossil remains of coccolithophores from a period of climate warming and ocean acidification that occurred around 56 million years ago			1
this time is known as the @entity63 ( @entity63 )			0
it offers a long - term view of coccolithophore response to ocean acidification			2
scientists already know that warming waters and increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels lead to the acidification of the oceans , which kills off coral ( pictured )			1
this study gives experts another organism to study and look for warning signs of damage dr @entity78 , from @entity79 and @entity80 said : ‘ our results show that climate change significantly altered coccolithophore calcification rates at the @entity63 and has the potential to be just as significant , perhaps even more so , today			1
‘ ultimately then , it is the factors that influence where species live , their abundance , how fast they grow and their ability to adapt to environmental change that is likely to control future coccolithophore calcite production			2
’ the study investigated two key ancient coccolithophores - @entity22 and @entity95 - both of which are directly related to species that dominate the modern ocean			1
it found that calcification rates of @entity100 and @entity101 halved during the @entity63 because the environment influenced their growth			1
the response of each species was different , and involved intervals of slowed growth in @entity109 pelagicus and an overall reduction in the size of the skeletal components in @entity113			0
however , there was little evidence for any response to ocean acidification , other than perhaps a slight thinning of @entity109 pelagicus coccoliths			0
dr @entity120 told @entity121 that smaller and thinner skeletons may mean that algae may be easier prey , but no evidence of this has been found			2
a larger question , which the study does not answer , may be that if the creatures have smaller skeletons , animals up the food chain may get less calcium by eating them , which is needed to contract muscle , transmit messages through nerves and releasing hormones - as well as strengthening bones			2
fish are losing their survival instinct as the world 's oceans become more acidic because of climate change , a study released earlier this year claimed			1
the research confirmed laboratory experiments showing that the behaviour of reef fish can be seriously affected by increased carbon dioxide concentrations in the ocean			0
carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere is absorbed into ocean waters , where it dissolves and lowers the ph of the water			0
fish are losing their survival instinct as the world 's oceans become more acidic because of climate change , a study released earlier this year claimed			1
a stock image is pictured the study was the first to analyse the sensory impairment of fish from carbon dioxide seeps , where @entity155 is similar to what climate models forecast for surface waters by the turn of the century			2
the ph of normal ocean surface water is around 8.14			0
the study examined fish from so - called bubble reefs at a natural @entity175 seep in @entity176 , where the @entity155 is 7.8 on average			2
with today 's greenhouse gas emissions , climate models forecast @entity155 7.8 for ocean surface waters by 2100 , according to the @entity181 ( @entity181 )			2
experts from the @entity183 in @entity184 showed that fish 's sensory systems are impaired by ocean acididication in the laboratory			0
' they can smell but they ca n't distinguish between chemical cues , ' biologist @entity189 said			0
acidic waters affect fish behavior by disrupting a specific receptor in the nervous system , called @entity196 , which is present in most marine organisms with a nervous system			0
when @entity196 stops working , neurons stop firing properly			0
coral reef habitat studies have found that co2 - induced behavioral changes , similar to those observed in the new study , increase mortality from predation by more than fivefold in newly settled fish			1
fish can smell a fish that eats another fish and will avoid water containing the scent			0
in dr @entity189 's laboratory experiments , control fish given the choice between swimming in normal water or water spiked with the smell of a predator chose the normal water			0
but fish raised in water acidified with carbon dioxide chose to spend time in the predator - scented water .			0

scientists from the @entity42 have studied coccolithophores - a type of ancient algae - that are still prolific today
growth of coccolithophores is affected as oceans become more acidic
study investigated ancient @entity238 and @entity239 *pertusus*
it found that calcification rates of @entity100 and @entity101 halved during the a period of climate change around 56 million years ago
