by @entity0 numbers game : the change means a caller dialling a local family member , business or take - away will have to punch in 11 - digits families in many fast - growing areas will have to dial the full national code to reach local people and businesses in a radical shake - up of the telephone system			1
telecoms watchdog @entity14 is making the change in a bid to overcome a predicted shortage of telephone numbers			1
families in @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 will be the first to experience the new system from november this year , adding 01202 to the front of any six - digit local number			1
another 44 areas will have to adopt the new regime by 2021			0
the change means a caller dialling a local family member , business or take - away will have to punch in an 11 - digit number			1
independent consumer research for the regulator found widespread scepticism that the country is running out of phone numbers			1
separately , many people , particularly the elderly , may struggle to get to grips with the new regime			0
but @entity14 insists the change is the ‘ least disruptive ’ way to create thousands of new numbers in areas with a heavy demand			1
after the @entity20 area , six places – @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 on @entity55 – will adopt national codes for local numbers by 2016			1
nine more areas – @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , and @entity67 – will change by 2018			2
a further 29 more will switch to the new regime by 2021 , ranging from @entity68 to @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 to @entity51 , and @entity72 to @entity73			0
@entity14 stressed that call charges will not rise as a result			0
the watchdog said the changes are necessary ‘ to safeguard the future supply of landline number across the @entity80 ’			0
it said : ‘ in a small number of areas of the @entity80 , where phone numbers are becoming very scarce , people will need to dial the whole number when making local calls			2
ringing in the changes : @entity14 insists the move is the ' least disruptive ' way to create thousands of new numbers in areas with a heavy demand ‘ this measure will enable @entity14 to make more numbers available in those areas			2
@entity14 ’s consumer research shows this to be the least disruptive option for making new phone numbers available for homes and businesses			2
' currently , @entity14 can not allocate phone numbers in which the first digit after the area code is 0 or 1 - for example , 01202 075 362 or 01273 118 903			2
this is because the network computers may confuse the number with other dialling codes or with a number reserved for special use , such as 118 for directory enquiries			0
once a requirement to use the national code is in place , hundreds of thousands of new local number combinations beginning 0 or 1 can be created			0
independent research by analysts @entity117 found many consumers simply did not believe that fixed line telephone numbers are running out			1
trial : @entity20 ( pictured ) will be one of the first places to experience the new system however , some 51 out of 63 people involved in focus groups backed the scheme chosen by @entity14 , although there was some resistance with one describing the change as ‘ a bit of nuisance ’			1
@entity117 said : ‘ for both businesses and consumers , closing the local dialling facility was seen as the least disruptive route and , behaviourally , an easy step			0
’ it added : ‘ there is very clear evidence to suggest that whilst local dialling is still widely used by residential consumers and businesses , it is largely taken for granted and seen as ‘ nice to have ’ , not a necessity			0
‘ very few consumers or businesses had concerns if it was to disappear			0
’ one reason for the shortage of numbers is that several telecom giants are effectively hoarding blocks of numbers that might be issued to new customers at a future date			1
@entity14 is launching a pilot scheme to charge telecoms firms 10p a year for every phone number they hold to provide a financial incentive on them to give them up to people who need them .			0

change is being *planned* to *tackle* a predicted shortage of telephone numbers
families in @entity21 , @entity20 and @entity22 to be the first to trial new system
