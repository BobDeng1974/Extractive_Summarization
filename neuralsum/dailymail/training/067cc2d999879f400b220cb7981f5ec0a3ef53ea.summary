he was given a rock star reception at the @entity23 conference			2
a crowd chanting ‘ @entity0 , @entity0 , @entity0 ’ gathered at new street station when he arrived by train and he faced a scrum of delegates and media at the conference hotel			1
at a rally in his honour attended by around 1,000 grassroots @entity45 , mr @entity0 said : ‘ i ’m a strong believer in competitive education			1
what was the @entity49 ? it was a pageant of competition			0
we should be allowing children to compete academically			0
‘ i personally have no objections to selective admissions at some stage			0
’ he said ‘ some people object ’ to the 11 plus , which divides pupils at that age , but he said it should be possible to select at later ages			0
and in a clear hint that he wants a wider national role , mr @entity0 concluded : ‘ as far as party policy is concerned i ’m not in a position to do this – yet			1
’ mr @entity0 tonight received a standing ovation from hundreds of activists at a @entity71 fringe meeting the @entity0 circus threatened to overshadow the main keynote speech today from chancellor @entity74 he also said he would continue to speak out in favour of a new hub airport , an idea the @entity78 has punted into the long grass			1
his provocative intervention on education may not please @entity82 , who decided against reopening the grammar school debate back in 2007			2
conference : @entity0 takes centre stage but not everyone has been swept up in boris - mania			2
veteran minister @entity88 today said mr @entity0 had to grow up			1

he added it would be ' disastrous ' if mr @entity0 could not get the ' fashionable ' speculation under control			1
health minister @entity101 also played down the idea that the public was gripped by @entity104 : ' not one person in my constiuency ever has said anything to me about @entity0			2
' but the @entity0 circus still threatened to overshadow the main keynote speech today from chancellor @entity74			0
mr @entity0 refused to say if mr @entity82 was a better prime minister than he would be , insisting the claim was ‘ unverifiable ’			1

mr @entity0 said : ’ of course i am going to fight what i think might be ill - conceived @entity140 plans for a mansion tax when i read about it			2
' of course i am i going to continue to lobby for a long overdue solution to our aviation capacity problems			0
the rise and rise of his old friend has given @entity82 plenty to think about while in the conference hall earlier today ' no - one , as a result of that , should have any cause to doubt my admiration of @entity82			0
' he , @entity74 and the government are doing exactly what is needed to clean up the country and the mess @entity160 left			0
' but in a direct challenge to mr @entity82 he warned against thinking a third runway at @entity163 would solve @entity165 's aviation capacity crisis			1
' i say to my friends who secretly think a third runway : you need to move away from that idea			0
' none of these solutions is easy but we ca n't do is turn a blind eye to what is happening in other @entity176 countries			0
' and he raised the prospect of a return to grammar schools , an issue which threatened to destabilise mr @entity82 's leadership in 2007			1
' i am a strong believer in competitive education , ' mr @entity0 said			2
' we should be able to allow children to compete academically in my view in that way			0
' i personally have no objection to selective admissions at some stage in a child 's development			0
' the success of the @entity195 and @entity196 on his watch has boosted mr @entity0 's popularity just as mr @entity82 's has waned			1
mr @entity0 joked : ' i sometimes think after the great success of the @entity195 and @entity196 is we need more things like it			2
what 's next ? the @entity49			0
' ' @entity205 would be wanging the bell end			0
me for the zip wire , @entity208 for the 800m , @entity210 for the judo			0
' and @entity134 for the high jump			0
' the remarkable scenes as mr @entity0 arrived in @entity23 contrast with the low key arrival of mr @entity82 at the conference centre on saturday and confirm mr @entity0 's reputation as political box office			1
asked if he was in @entity23 to make trouble for prime minister , mr @entity0 replied : ' i 'm here to support the party			1
' he ignored further questions as he was chased through the hotel			0

mr @entity82 has been repeatedly forced to answer questions about the threat to his leadership posed by his old schoolfriend from @entity230			2
