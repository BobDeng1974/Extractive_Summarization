by @entity0 a deadly strain of bird flu previously unknown in people has begun to mutate into a form more likely to cause a human pandemic , scientists say			2
just days after authorities in @entity8 announced they had identified cases of @entity10 , flu experts in laboratories across the world are picking through the dna sequence data of samples isolated from patients to assess its severity			1
one of the world ’s top flu experts , @entity21 , from the @entity22 in @entity23 , says the sequences show some genetic mutations that should put authorities on alert and entail increased surveillance in animals and humans			1
' the virus has to a certain extent already adapted to mammalian species and to humans , so from that point of view it ’s worrisome , ' he said			0
a deadly strain of bird flu previously unknown in people has begun to mutate into a form more likely to cause a human pandemic , say scientists ' really we should keep a very close eye on this			1
' @entity8 ’s @entity46 confirmed that three people had been infected with the new @entity10 flu , with two deaths of men in @entity51 aged 87 and 27 who fell sick in late february			1
@entity8 authorities have in the past two days confirmed another six cases , including another fatal one			1
the @entity56 ( @entity56 ) says the cases of @entity10 are ' of concern ' because they are the first in humans			2
' that makes it a unique event , which the @entity56 is taking seriously , ' the @entity63 - based @entity62 health agency said today			0
other strains of bird flu , such as @entity69 , have been circulating for many years and can be transmitted from bird to bird , and bird to human , but not from human to human			0
so far , this lack of human - to - human transmission also appears to be a feature of the @entity10 strain			2
other strains of bird flu , such as @entity69 ( pictured ) , have been circulating for many years and can be transmitted from bird to bird , and bird to human , but not from human to human flu viruses are classified based on two types of protein found on their surface , haemagglutinin and neuraminidase , which are abbreviated to @entity93 and @entity94 although it is very early days , scientists says initial analysis also suggests @entity10 does not appear to make birds particularly ill - in other words it is what is known as a low pathogenic avian influenza , of @entity102			1
unfortunately , this does n’t necessarily mean it will be mild in humans , says @entity106 , a flu virology expert at @entity109 ’s @entity108			0
its mildness in birds could also mean @entity10 is a ' silent spreader ' - harder to detect than highly pathogenic flu strains such as @entity69 that can wipe out entire flocks of wild birds or domestic poultry and are therefore far more visible			0
in 2003 , @entity8 initially tried to cover up an epidemic of @entity118 ( @entity118 ) , which emerged in @entity8 and killed about a tenth of the 8,000 people it infected worldwide .			0

*warning* comes days after authorities in @entity8 announced they had identified cases of @entity10
flu experts are currently picking through dna data of *victims* to assess severity of the strain
@entity133 needs a ' very close eye kept on it ' say experts
