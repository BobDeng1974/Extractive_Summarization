biometric experts at @entity108 - based firm @entity107 have created a dongle fitted with an iris scanner			0
the @entity112 device can register up to five different users			0
each user begins by scanning their eyes to take an image of their respective irises			0
these unique images are then translated into an encrypted code			0
the scan takes between 10 and 20 seconds and the authentication code is created immediately			0
once registered , each user can add various online passwords to their @entity112 profile			0
next time the user visits one of these accounts , instead of entering a password , they can scan their eyes for immediate and secure access			0
according to @entity107 , the @entity133 of the average fingerprint sensor , in which the system is hacked by an unknown print , is one in every 10,000 scans			0
for iris scans , this increases to one 1 in 2.25 trillion scans			0

@entity175 scanning involves a simple charge - coupled device digital camera that uses visible and near - infrared light to take a clear , high - contrast image of a person ’s iris			0
when the camera takes the image , a scanner plots the centre of the pupil , edge of the pupil , edge of the iris , eyelids and eyelashes			0
it then analyses the unique patterns in the iris and translates this pattern into a code			0
next time the eye is scanned , this code is compared to the pattern to authenticate a match			0
the iris scanner would not be the first time @entity2 has introduced eye - tracking technology			0
its @entity207 includes a feature that locks onto the movement and position of a user ’s eyes			0
