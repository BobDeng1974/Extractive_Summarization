a labyrinth of secret underground tunnels believed to have been used by the @entity2 to develop a nuclear bomb has been uncovered			0
the facility , which covers an area of up to 75 acres , was discovered near the town of @entity8 an der @entity9 , @entity10 last week , it has been reported			1
excavations began on the site after researchers detected heightened levels of radiation in the area - supporting claims that the @entity2 were developing nuclear weapons			1
it is believed to be connected to @entity26 weapons facility @entity24 ( above ) research : excavations began on the site after heightened levels of radiation were detected in the area - supporting long - standing claims that the @entity2 were developing nuclear weapons			1
above , @entity24 significant : documentary maker @entity35 , who is leading the excavations , said that the site is ' most likely the biggest secret weapons production facility of the @entity26			1
above , @entity24 documentary maker @entity35 , who is leading the excavations , told the @entity41 that the site is ' most likely the biggest secret weapons production facility of the @entity26 '			1
it is believed to be connected to the @entity45 underground factory , where the @entity47 - the first operational jet fighter - was built			2
there are also suggestions that the complex is connected to the @entity51			2
slave labour from the camp was used to build both complexes - with as many as 320,000 inmates in the harsh underground conditions			0
but while the @entity24 site was explored by @entity58 and @entity59 after the war , the @entity2 appeared to have gone through greater lengths to conceal the newly - discovered tunnels			2
its entrance was only uncovered after the excavation team , which includes historians and scientists , pieced together information in declassified intelligence documents and testimonies from witnesses			2
hidden : while the nearby @entity73 site was explored by @entity58 and @entity59 forces after the war , the @entity2 appeared to have gone through greater lengths to conceal the newly - discovered tunnels near @entity8 military centre : the newly - discovered site is believed to be connected to the @entity45 underground factory , pictured above , where the @entity47 - the first operational jet fighter - was built development : while the @entity24 site , pictured above , was explored by @entity58 and @entity59 after the war , the @entity2 appeared to have gone through greater lengths to conceal the newly - discovered tunnels the team is now in the process of removing layers of soil and concrete packed into the tunnels and heavy granite plates that were used to cover the entrance			1
helmets belonging to @entity93 troops and other @entity26 relics are among the items that have been uncovered so far			1
the excavation was halted last week by police , who demanded the group produce a permit for conducting research on historic sites			0
but mr @entity35 is confident that work will resume next month			0
he told the @entity41 : ' prisoners from concentration camps across @entity106 were handpicked for their special skills - physicists , chemists or other experts - to work on this monstrous project and we owe it to the victims to finally open the site and reveal the truth			0
' the probe was triggered by a research documentary by mr @entity35 on @entity119 's quest to build an atomic bomb			1
in it , he referenced diary entries from a physicist called up to work for the @entity2			0
there is other evidence of scientists working for a secret project managed by ss general @entity128			0
@entity128 , who signed off the plans for the gas chambers and crematorium at @entity132 , was in charge of @entity119 's missile programmes			0
mr @entity35 searched archives in @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 for evidence of the nuclear weapons - building project led by the @entity93 he discovered that on january 2 , 1944 , some 272 inmates of @entity51 were taken from the camp to @entity8 to begin the construction of secret galleries			1
by november that year , 20,000 out of 40,000 slave labourers drafted in to build the tunnels had been worked to death			0
after the war , @entity10 spent some Â£ 10million in pouring concrete into most of the tunnels			1
but @entity35 and his backers believe they missed a secret section where the atomic research was conducted			2
brutal : slave labour from @entity51 ( pictured ) was used to build both the @entity8 site and @entity24 with as many as 320,000 inmates in the harsh underground conditions the @entity158 were stationed in @entity8 until 1955 and they took all of the files on the site back with them to @entity137			0
experts are trying to discover if there is a link between @entity8 and sites in @entity136 proper where scientists were assembled during the @entity26 in a bid to match @entity138 efforts to build the ultimate weapon			1
in june 2011 , atomic waste from @entity119 's secret nuclear programme was believed to have been found in an old mine near @entity174			0
more than 126,000 barrels of nuclear material lie rotting over 2,000 feet below ground in an old salt mine			0
rumour has it that the remains of nuclear scientists who worked on the @entity26 programme are also there , their irradiated bodies burned in secret by @entity93 men sworn to secrecy .			2

facility was discovered near the town of @entity193 , @entity10
*understood* that it could be connected to another @entity26 weapons facility
experts believe that it was used to conduct research into atomic bombs
supported by heightened radiation readings and witness testimonies
