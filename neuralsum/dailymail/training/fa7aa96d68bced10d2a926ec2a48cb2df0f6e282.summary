finally , he has conceded to one televised debate featuring @entity1 , as well as @entity11 leader @entity10 , @entity12 leader @entity12 , and the @entity14 leader @entity13			1
conceded : @entity0 has finally accepted a potential debate format featuring @entity2 leader @entity1 but voters will have to wait until october , after party conference season , for his aides to decide on a satisfactory format , sources claim			1
the revelation comes eight months after the @entity23 leader told @entity24 he did not believe @entity1 should be allowed to join the three leaders ' in a general election debate			2
he told the @entity28 interviewer : ' i think the debates predominantly should be about people who have a prospect of becoming prime minister			2
' @entity24 replied : ' and you think that @entity1 is not going to be our next prime minister ? ' ' i do n't think so , no , ' laughed @entity0			1
as the least known leader at the three , @entity12 ' mr @entity12 was seen as the big winner of the first of the three debates against @entity41 and @entity0 , with his poll ratings rocketing to record levels his remarks sparked a wave of criticism , as @entity2 gain momentum , swinging @entity23 voters with their stance on @entity50			1
today , in a dramatic turnaround , sources close to the prime minister told @entity54 he will now ' consider ' a format featuring the @entity2 leader			1

' we 're open to debates			0
we 're just not going to start negotiating now			0
' addition : sources close to @entity0 claim he will only face up to @entity1 in a televised debate if @entity14 leader @entity13 is also on the panel @entity0 notoriously lost out to his @entity68 partner @entity12 in the first tv debates ahead of the 2010 general election			1
as the least known leader at the three , @entity12 ' mr @entity12 was seen as the big winner of the first of the three debates against @entity41 and @entity0 , with his poll ratings rocketing to record levels			2
since taking office , the prime minister has made clear he found the debates to be a distraction to the election			1
but in recent months , @entity0 has come under increasing pressure to agree to a debate			0
in january , @entity1 - who is wooing the @entity85 with his strict anti-immigration campaign - began threatening to broadcast a rival show to voters if @entity0 excludes @entity2 from the debates			0
he told the @entity28 ’s @entity89 : ‘ politics has changed a lot since 2010			0
we ’ve seen radical change in @entity94 politics in the last decade , in @entity96 politics and @entity98 politics is going through a big change			0
‘ i remember in 2009 , when @entity2 came second in the euro elections , being told it can never happen in domestic politics and in this year ’s @entity98 county elections , we got nearly a quarter of the vote			0
‘ the point is , @entity2 is now a significant force in @entity108 politics ; we ’re polling double what the @entity12 are and i think frankly , to exclude @entity2 from these debates would probably give us the benefit of the underdog because it would look like the political class closing ranks on itself			0

prime minister made clear he wants @entity1 to be excluded from debates
after months of pressure @entity0 aides have settled on potential format
may accept one debate with @entity1 , @entity10 , @entity12 and @entity124 leader
