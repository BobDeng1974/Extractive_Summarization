by @entity0 the origins of @entity2 have been traced back 2,000 years by scientist			1
a @entity5 image is pictured the origins of @entity2 have been traced back 2,000 years by scientists			2
and they believe finding the roots of other folk tales could show how humans migrated throughout history			0
using techniques pioneered by evolutionary biologists , the new study reveals the folk tale first appeared in a spoken version called @entity17 and the kids , which is still told in some countries			1
today the two stories are distinct , although their shared root has evolved into a number of different stories told in @entity24 and @entity25 since the original yarn first appeared in @entity27 in the first century @entity28			1
experts at @entity30 used mathematical modelling to plot the ' evolutionary tree ' of @entity17 and the kids - a tale about a wolf that impersonates a nanny goat and eats her young			1
they found the @entity39 favourite @entity2 , whose wolf character devours a young girl in a similar deception , branched off around 1,000 years along the evolutionary tree			1
it evolved as a spoken story in @entity46 , @entity47 and northern @entity48 before being written down by @entity46 author @entity49 in the 1600s and was later re-told in its most familiar form by the @entity53 , 200 years ago			2
while @entity17 and the @entity33 - which is popular in @entity27 and the @entity55 - was evolving from spoken word to the printed tale of @entity2 in @entity27 , it travelled south to @entity24 and eastwards to @entity25 to become @entity58 in @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61			1
because the tale spent much of its early existence as a spoken story , it was difficult to trace back through time , as there are no written versions that could give researchers a reference point of date and place			1
experts at @entity30 used mathematical modelling to plot the ' evolutionary tree ' of @entity17 and the kids and found the @entity39 favourite @entity2 , whose wolf character devours a young girl in a similar deception , branched off around 1,000 years along the evolutionary tree @entity30 anthropologist dr @entity77 , used a technique called phylogenetics - a mathematical modelling system - to compare 72 areas of similarity between 58 variations of the folk tale collected from around the world			1
the method is used by biologists for grouping closely - related organisms to map their evolution , but it helped him build a ' tree ' that revealed the most likely branches , or paths , that the various versions took through time and revealed a surprising coincidence			0
dr @entity77 explained : ' this is rather like a biologist showing that humans and other apes share a common ancestor but have evolved into distinct species			1
an illustration based on the fable @entity17 and the kids , which highlights the dangers of talking to strangers ' my research cracks a long - standing mystery			0
the @entity24 tales turn out to be descended from @entity17 and the kids but over time , they have evolved to become like @entity2 , which is also likely to be descended from @entity17 and the kids			2
' this exemplifies a process biologists call convergent evolution , in which species independently evolve similar adaptations			0
' the fact that @entity2 ‘ evolved twice ’ from the same starting point suggests it holds a powerful appeal that attracts our imaginations			1
' his findings , published in the @entity129 journal @entity127 , also overturned the theory believed by some that a forerunner to @entity2 originally came from the @entity133			2
' it is claimed the tale spread west , along the @entity136 , and gave rise to both @entity17 and the kids and the modern version of @entity2 , dr @entity77 said			1
' my analysis demonstrates that in fact the @entity60 version is derived from @entity27 oral traditions , and not vice versa			2
' specifically , the @entity60 blended together @entity2 , @entity17 and the kids and local folktales to create a new , hybrid story			2
' this implies that the @entity60 version is not derived from literary versions of @entity2 but from the older , oral version , with which it shares crucial similarities , ' he said			2
dr @entity77 added that applying the technique to other folk tales could reveal how humans migrated throughout history , by tracing the folk stories ’ origin in time and geographically			1
the tale of @entity17 and @entity163 morphed into a @entity165 fable by the @entity53 and is about a mother goat who leaves her kids at home but warns them not to open the door to a wolf who might impersonate her high voice			0
she says they can also recognise her by her white feet , but the wolf covers himself in flour so he has white feet and mimics her voice , enters the house and eats all except the smallest of the kids			0
the mother finds the wolf and cuts him open with a pair of scissors and her young spring out unharmed			0
she fills the wolf 's stomach with rocks before sewing him up and the wolf is so thirsty , he goes to drink in a stream and drowns , while the family of goats live happily ever after			0
the tale of @entity200 features a similar warning about strangers			0
a mother leaves her two children at home in a quiet village while she goes out on a long journey to get food and tells the children not to let strangers inside while she is away over night			0
but in the village there lives a bad tiger with a penchant for eating children			0
the big cat dresses up as a grandmother and in the middle of the night , eats the younger child			0
realising the grandmother is really the tiger , the older , wiser child runs outside to wait for the mother to return .			0

the original yarn , upon which @entity2 was based , first appeared in @entity27 in the first century ad
@entity30 anthropologist dr @entity77 used a mathematical modelling system to compare 72 areas of similarity between 58 versions of the folk tale
he found @entity2 ' evolved twice ' from the same starting point , suggesting the story holds a powerful appeal
