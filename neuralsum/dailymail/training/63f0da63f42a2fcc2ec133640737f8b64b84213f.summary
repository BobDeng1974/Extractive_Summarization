the latest specialist equipment from the @entity1 in @entity2 has used infrared imaging to capture striking images of the @entity5 situated around 6,000 light years from @entity6			1
the second - generation @entity8 - 2 camera has also snapped unique high - resolution images from the heart of a spiral galaxy as well as a ring of star formation			1
@entity14 is spectroscopic , which means it has been designed to specifically study and record matter and radiation energy in space			1
it shows ultraviolet radiation streaming from young hot stars that forms a region of dust and gas			0
@entity5 is found in the constellation @entity30 and is one of the biggest star - forming region 's in the local galaxy the @entity1 is an astronomical observatory made up of two 8.19 - metre telescopes at sites in @entity37 and @entity2			1
together , the twin telescopes provide almost complete coverage of both the northern and southern skies			0
one telescope , called @entity1 , is located on @entity37 's @entity43 volcano			2
this location was picked because it has a stable , dry , and rarely cloudy atmosphere above the 4,200 - metre - high dormant volcano			2
the other telescope , @entity1 , is located at around 2,700 metres high on a mountain in the @entity49 called @entity50			1
there are only two small regions neither telescope can capture near the celestial poles : @entity1 can not point north of declination +89 degrees which @entity1 ca n't point south of -89 degrees			2
after significant redesign and rebuilds on the @entity1 telescope , @entity14 is taking images as part of various commissioning phases with the hope it will be sent onto missions exploring the most distant and energetic explosions in our universe			1
the instrument includes an extreme sensitivity to infrared ( heat ) radiation from the universe , high - resolution wide - field imaging and a combination of spectroscopic capabilities			1
@entity14 is the second - generation infrared instrument to be built by the team at the @entity1 observatory			1
the first , called @entity8 i , suffered damage to its lens when it cracked during a planned final commissioning in early 2012			2
this was caused by temperature changes that occurred as the area around the lens switched masks in order to capture multiple spectroscopic images			0
the second - generation instrument has had design modifications that significantly reduces the risk of these temperature changes to the lens 's integrity and functionality			2
@entity8 - 2 will continue to be tested and will carry out more commissioning phases before being made available to astronomers later this year			1
the heart of spiral galaxy ngc 253 , pictured , which lies about 11.5 million light years from @entity6			0
the @entity8 instrument captured this whirlpool of dust spiralling into a nuclear region , where star formation is thought to be occurring around a supermassive black hole ' it 's already one of our most requested instruments at the @entity111 telescopes , ' said @entity112 , @entity111 's deputy director and @entity114			1
' we see a long and productive life ahead for @entity8 - 2 once astronomers really start using it later this year			1
' ' it has not been an easy journey , ' added @entity111 's @entity120 , but thanks to the dedicated work of @entity111 engineers and scientists very soon astronomers will be able to use a reliable and robust instrument			2
' work still remains on some of the instrument 's spectroscopic features , as well as refining imaging at the edge of its large field of view			0
@entity134 of the @entity135 already has plans to use flamingos - 2 later this year to study the exoplanet @entity137			1
this exoplanet is being strongly heated by its ultra-nearby host star and according to @entity134 , ' it 's even hotter than some of the coolest , low - mass stars known			0
' @entity134 and his team hope to determine the abundances of water vapor and methane when the planet is eclipsed by its host star			0
@entity150 6300 , pictured , is a spiral galaxy in the constellation of @entity153			0
this image , taken by @entity8 , shows the galaxy 's arm structure forming a ring of star formation			2
the galaxy 's bar also has a vein of dust that almost obscures its bright nucleus in the centre ' our plan is to compare the system 's light immediately before and during an eclipse to measure the contribution from the planet			0
' when we do this over several parts of the infrared part of the light spectrum , we can piece together the planet 's spectrum and learn about its temperature and composition			0
' once the instrument has finished testing an adaptive optics ( @entity183 ) feed for extremely high - resolution imaging from @entity185 ( @entity187 adaptive optics system ) may be added			1
this technology is capable of removing atmospheric distortion - or blurriness - when taking pictures of space , making images much clearer			0
it is expected that this system will be fully integrated in 2014 with imaging and long - slit spectroscopy available now			0
the next round of observations with @entity14 are set to begin on 1st september			0
@entity14 's latest commissioning phase captured this image of spiral galaxy @entity150			0
it is the brightest member of the @entity203 of galaxies , situated around 60 million light years away			0
plans are to make the instrument available to astronomers later this year			1

high - *definition* images of galaxies captured by @entity8 instrument
it is the latest equipment to be tested at the @entity1 in @entity2
the camera can record and study changes in radiation heat and matter
plans are to make the instrument available to astronomers by 2014
