@entity0 , take a bow			2
that was perhaps the worst assistant refereeing performance i have ever seen with so many key incidents judged incorrectly			2
first of all , he failed to see that @entity7 was in an offside position and allowed him to score @entity10 's second goal			1
then as @entity12 chased a through ball , @entity11 clearly came out of his penalty area and handled the ball			1
@entity11 should have been dismissed and surely would have been had any other @entity36 assistant been running the line on saturday			2
later in the first - half @entity38 was put through and was onside but @entity0 flagged and then repeated his error in the second half when @entity43 broke away for @entity20			1
there was no favouritism by the officials - both sides were penalised incorrectly			0
@entity25 , perhaps caught up in @entity0 's inefficiency , then allowed @entity11 to escape a red card again following @entity10 's third goal			1
first , he ran out and grabbed @entity38 's shirt			0
then he went head to head with @entity54			0
yet only a yellow card for the @entity57 keeper			0
an incredible game of nine goals , blessed with amazing ebb and flow , was perhaps ironically helped by the consistently poor officiating which also allowed @entity38 to also escape a red card			0
he should have been shown two yellows and dismissed			0
booking : @entity11 ( left ) is only yellow carded by referee @entity25 ( centre ) but should have been sent off fiesty : a nine - goal thriller at @entity69 was helped by some awful refereeing decisions by the officials			1

assistant referee @entity0 missed several key incidents on saturday
@entity0 failed to see @entity75 was offside for @entity10 's second
he also missed @entity11 handling outside penalty area at @entity69
@entity0 gave two offside decisions which were both onside as well
referee @entity25 failed to send out both @entity11 and @entity38
@entity10 left @entity69 with a 6 - 3 *victory* over @entity20 on saturday
