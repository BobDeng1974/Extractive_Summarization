by @entity0 published : 06:38 est , 22 october 2013 updated : 07:11 est , 22 october 2013 tax scheme : @entity2 promotes the new more expensive @entity4 draw for @entity5 this month , which has today been accused of avoiding £ 10m in corporation tax national lottery owner @entity5 has today been accused of avoiding at least £ 10million in corporation tax by exploiting a loophole that @entity9 knows about but has never closed			1
just weeks after the cost of a @entity4 ticket doubled to £ 2 , it emerged the @entity14 - owned business has used a legal fiddle based in a tax haven			1
to take advantage of the loophole , @entity5 reportedly took out high - interest loans from its parent company via the @entity21			1
they then used the giant interest payments these generated to reduce their profits , which may have saved them at least £ 10million in tax since april 2010			2
at least 30 companies are said to use this loophole , which may have taken away up to £ 500million each year from the taxman , according to @entity30 and @entity31			0
last year the government revealed it knew about the scheme , estimating it was losing £ 200million a year , but has still failed to shut it down after speaking to accountancy firms and big business			0
chair of the @entity38 , @entity36 has said she will take @entity9 to task over the issue at a hearing next week			0
' i find it extraordinary that @entity9 could be so naive as to send out a consultation document on closing a tax loophole to a group of vested interests , including some of the very people who benefit , or whose clients benefit , from it – and then accept their response seemingly without challenge , ' she told @entity31			1
@entity30 say that @entity5 could have avoided £ 10million in corporation tax after accruing £ 38.7million of interest on £ 172.6million it owes to its owner the @entity57			1
loans are taken out at around 12.5 per cent rather than the five per cent offered by @entity60 banks because it is more tax efficient			0
tax haven : @entity5 has apparently taken out high - interest loans via the @entity65 ( pictured ) , which then allows them to reduce their profits and therefore their corporation tax bill but @entity5 said today that ' their analysis of our figures is inaccurate ' , but did not deny using the loophole			1
' @entity5 complies fully with all @entity60 regulatory , tax and legal requirements – and is a very significant @entity60 taxpayer , ' a spokesman said			2
' in fact , in the period reported by the @entity31 , @entity5 paid @entity60 taxes well in excess of £ 1.5 billion			0
' this figure included lottery duty , corporation tax and ( non-recoverable ) vat			0
during the same period , @entity5 generated almost £ 3.5billion for @entity86 across the @entity60 and paid out over £ 6.2billion in prizes to players			0
' @entity5 ’s strategy for long - term , responsible growth has seen it grow total national lottery sales by over 50 per cent in the last decade – meaning that it now raises over £ 35million for @entity86 each week			2
' @entity9 refused to say why it did not shut the loophole and said : ' for legal reasons , @entity9 can not comment on the affairs of individual taxpayers			2

*investigation* finds business taking high - interest loans to cut profit and tax
legal loophole became known to @entity9 last year but they kept it open
this month @entity5 has doubled the price of a @entity4 ticket to £ 2
