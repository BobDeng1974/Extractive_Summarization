by @entity0 published : 17:31 est , 27 january 2014 updated : 17:37 est , 27 january 2014 a @entity3 man was billed $ 80,000 for an 18 - hour hospital stay last summer after being bitten by a snake - and almost all of the bill was for anti-venom			1
@entity8 , 54 , of @entity9 , was shocked when he received the massive bill from @entity11 attributing more than $ 81,000 of the cost to a four - vial dose of anti-venom			1
he told the @entity18 he was able to find the same anti-venom online at prices ranging from $ 750 to 12,000 per vial , a staggering difference for which they demanded an explanation			1
sticker shock : @entity24 and @entity25 were surprised after receiving their almost $ 90,000 bill from @entity11 mr @entity25 ’s health insurance through @entity29 of @entity3 reduced the total bill from @entity11 to just over $ 20,000 , of which he paid a deductible of about $ 5,400 – but his wife worried about the cost of being uninsured			1
‘ what if it was someone that did n’t have the resources to research and did n’t have insurance ? ’ wife @entity39 wondered aloud to the paper			0
‘ what is fair and equitable here ? ’ when reached by the @entity18 , the hospital released a statement saying it rarely charges list prices			2
‘ we are required to give @entity48 one level of discount from list price , @entity52 another , and private insurers negotiate for still others , ’ said the statement			0
‘ if we did not start with the list prices we have , we would not end up with enough revenue to remain in operation … our costs for providing uncompensated care are partially covered by higher bills for other patients			0
@entity11 : the hospital where the $ 90,000 bill was incurred last summer ‘ in some cases , @entity69 ’s charge is considerably higher than other local hospitals , ’ the statement continued , explaining that discounts of about 62 to 65 percent are offered to patients without insurance , according to the @entity18			1
a lawsuit was filed in 2010 by doctors at @entity11 and another local hospital accusing the medical facilities of offering kickbacks to doctors who could provide unnecessary treatment			0
parent company @entity79 denied the allegations , but declined further comment			0
the @entity83 ’ concern is not solitary			0
a @entity84 expose last year on the cost of medical care in the @entity87 revealed @entity87 spend $ 2.8trillion a year – 20 per cent of @entity88 – on medical care .			2

@entity25 was charged $ 20,000 each for four vials of anti-venom that he found online for as little as $ 750 each
his insurance reduced the cost , but he worried about those less *fortunate*
the hospital said it offers discounts to the uninsured , and charges those that are insured more to offset the cost of uninsured care
