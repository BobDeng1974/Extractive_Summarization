when @entity1 was out of work 12 months ago he travelled to the @entity4 battlefields to indulge his love of history and took time to travel to @entity7 to see his new baby grandson			1
this time it will be different			0
three days after leaving @entity10 all the 56 - year - old wants is to return to management as soon as possible			1
he 's proved that he has more variety in his coaching repertoire than the long throws for which his @entity18 team were once notorious - and he wants to find another home to use his unique ability to build and develop a football club			0
@entity23 resolution : former @entity10 boss @entity1 wants to get back in management as soon as possible @entity1 , named @entity25 by the @entity26 just three short months ago , is fiercely proud not only of how he saved @entity10 from an instant return to the @entity28 but of how he did it			1
he has asked the @entity26 to help him tie up the legal niceties of his exit from @entity32 as quickly as possible to allow him to move on			2
on saturday night , a friend said : ' @entity34 is old school and loves football and wants to work again as soon as possible			0
' after seven years at @entity18 he was possibly ready for a break – this time he 's hungry to remain in the game because he really enjoyed what he achieved at @entity10 and is disappointed he has n't been able to kick on			2
' @entity1 saw the fields where the @entity41 took place and made sure that he did n't lead @entity10 into impossible positions			1
but he walked out of @entity32 on thursday feeling his job had become untenable as his relationship with chairman @entity46 broke down			1
the two clashed over transfer policy and budgets , with @entity10 having spent just £ 2.5million so far this summer despite collecting more than £ 60million in tv income by staying in the top flight			2
he took over last november a club that had just four points , and not only finished 11th but did it by evolving an exciting style of play that made a nonsense of the long ball reputation that was a hangover from his early @entity18 days			0
broken relationship : @entity1 failed to see eye - to - eye with @entity10 co-chairman @entity46 ( right ) @entity10 fans who were initially reluctant about his appointment loved the free flowing use of wingers and wanted more , except from better players and a stronger squad			1
the friend said : ' the idea which is being put around that the chairman did n't want to back @entity70 in the transfer market because he did n't like the style of play is frankly mystifying			0
' when he took over he had to work with the squad he inherited and he organised them to play with pace and power and be really quick through the pitch			0
' the result was some fantastically exciting games and some brilliant nights at @entity32 that got the ground absolutely buzzing			2
' nobody was complaining about the style of play when @entity10 beat @entity84 near the end of the season , or won 3 - 2 at @entity87 , or drew 3 - 3 with @entity88			1
' people were saying that was one of the most exciting games seen at @entity32 in years			2
' @entity1 had planned to kick @entity10 forward during the summer , and believed he had convinced @entity95 centre half @entity93 to sign , only to find the club could n't agree a deal			1
he wanted to strengthen the squad with other top players , but increasingly clashed with @entity100 and director of football @entity101 about recruitment			0
behind the scenes he has started work on plans to improve the club 's training and medical facilities , just as he did at @entity18 during seven years that dragged the club into the @entity112			0
temporary charge : @entity114 has stepped in to take control of the @entity10 following @entity1 ' sudden departure but he believed that after working miracles to not just stay up but finish in 11th place – securing an extra £ 8million in merit money from the @entity25 's tv rights distribution fund – he had earned the right to have a bigger say in where the club went next			1
@entity10 finished the season in a rich vein of form losing only one of their last eight games and scoring 14 goals in the process			2
and @entity1 planned to serve up more entertainment while targeting a top half @entity25 finish for the first time in the club 's history			1
instead he ended up unwilling to risk his proud record of never getting relegated in 22 years and 920 games as a manager if he did n't have the final say on the make - up of his squad			0
@entity1 left @entity32 on thursday feeling his job had become untenable as his relationship with chairman @entity46 broke down over transfer policy and budgets			1
he took over last november when @entity10 had just four points and guided them to an 11th - placed finish playing exciting football that made a mockery of the long - ball reputation he earned from his early @entity18 days			1
the friend added : ' the idea which is being put around that the chairman did n't want to back @entity70 in the transfer market because he did n't like the style of play is frankly mystifying			0
' when he took over he had to work with the squad he inherited and he organised them to play with pace and power and be really quick through the pitch			0
' the result was some fantastically exciting games and some brilliant nights at @entity32 that got the ground absolutely buzzing			0

the @entity170 left @entity10 by *mutual* *consent* on thursday
@entity1 *decided* to leave @entity32 after a row with @entity46
@entity10 lost 2 - 1 against @entity175 in their @entity25 opener
