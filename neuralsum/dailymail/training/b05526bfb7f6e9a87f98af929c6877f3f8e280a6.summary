creating a space elevator on @entity1 has been considered as a possible way to cheaply and easily get things into space - either for building structures or providing supplies to a space station			1
but a team of experts are instead suggesting we should build one on the moon , to get useful material from the lunar surface			1
and in a newly released video the infrastructure that might make this possible has been revealed			0
the @entity21 says it could be up and running by the end of 2019			1
their design will involve an ' anchor ' that is drilled into the lunar surface			1
rovers will then scoop up material , to be transport to a space station in orbit the @entity18 - based venture known as the @entity21 received about £ 70,000 ( $ 110,000 ) worth of funding on @entity35 back in september 2012			1
in october this year they also ran a @entity35 to make a short film called ' shoot the moon ' about the project , which was also fully funded to just over £ 24,000 ( $ 37,000 )			0
and the group says they can have their ambitious proposal up and running by the end of 2019			2
in september of this year dreams of taking an elevator into space were given a boost after researchers created ultra-thin , super-strong nanothreads made from diamonds			2
the threads are made up of a long , thin strand of carbon atoms arranged in the same way as the inside of a diamond			0
the discovery could finally be the breakthrough needed to hoist and support cosmic elevators that would transport people into the atmosphere			0
the research was carried out by @entity61 , a professor of chemistry at @entity63 , and the findings were published in the journal @entity66			0
their plan is to use a ‘ ribbon ’ cable to transport material , robots and even humans to and from the surface of the moon			0
it will be attached to a space station in a @entity78 around the moon , which is a position where the moon and @entity1 ’s gravity cancel out , so a spacecraft or station can remain stationary			1
the cable from the station , dubbed the @entity86 ( @entity87 ) , will drop down to a location on the moon known as @entity90 - which is roughly in the middle of the face that looks towards @entity1			1
on the surface will be the @entity94 ( nicknamed @entity95 ) @entity96			0
one of the main purposes of this structure will be mining the surface of the moon			0
the company plans to release rovers , which will extract valuable elements from the lunar soil			0
this will include rare @entity1 elements and @entity106 , which can then either be shipped to @entity1 or stored in space to be used as fuel			2
the cable from the station , dubbed the @entity86 ( @entity87 ) , will drop down to a location on the moon known as @entity90 ( shown ) - which is roughly in the middle of the face that looks towards @entity1 to construct the space station , @entity114 plans to use a counterweight			1
this involves ‘ balancing ’ the station in orbit with an object so that it stays in position			0
for this lunar elevator , the counterweight would be placed at the top of the 155,000 mile - long ( 250,000km ) ribbon , where it would be held in place by @entity1 ’s gravitational field			1
what material this ribbon will be made of , however , has not yet been revealed			0
the other end of the station will be anchored to the moon , using drills to keep it attached to the surface			2
and , like the @entity139 , the orbiting station around the moon will be modular - so more and more parts can be added over time			1
' @entity21 is throwing all of its weight behind the @entity143 , ' the company writes on their website			2
' the @entity94 will serve as both testing ground and demonstration of the feats mankind can accomplish when people work together			0
' it ’ll be a great opportunity to build on current research findings , and in the design and construction we know we ’ll develop materials and engineering techniques and gain technical knowledge that will apply to the design of @entity1 ’s space elevator			1
' to construct the space station , @entity114 plans to use a counterweight			2
for this lunar elevator , the counterweight would be placed at the top of the 155,000 mile - long ( 250,000km ) ribbon , where it would be held in place by @entity1 ’s gravitational field ( shown in illustration ) @entity114 says their design could be a precursor to an @entity1 - based space elevator system ( @entity174 illustration shown ) , which could make the transportation of material from @entity1 's surface into space much easier			1

@entity18 - based company is planning to build an elevator on the moon
the @entity21 says it could be up and running by the end of 2019
their design will involve an ' anchor ' that is drilled into the lunar surface
**resources** will be carried from the moon 's surface to an orbiting station
this space station will be anchored in an area of gravitational *stability*
@entity21 says the **resources** could be used on our planet or in space
and they say this could be a precursor to an @entity1 - based space elevator
