by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 06:44 est , 18 september 2013 updated : 19:00 est , 18 september 2013 a cash - strapped football club threw out antique oak chairs worth a fortune because its former @entity8 owner wanted a minimalistic look			1
the 14 chairs and a table from one of @entity14 ’s greatest warships were found in a skip seven years ago			1
the furniture was made for @entity17 , the world ’s first iron - hulled warship , and later donated by the @entity20 to @entity21			1
they were found by a builder in a skip			1
he kept them in storage with a view to one day returning them to the south coast club			2
the unnamed builder took the furniture to the @entity28 when it visited @entity21 and they are now set to feature on this sunday ’s show			1
the chairs have the design of a ship ’s wheel on the back and are likely to have been made for a ward room on @entity17 , which was built in the 1860s			1
they have been owned by @entity21 for more than 70 years but during the @entity60 , they were moved to a harbour fort , where @entity62 and @entity63 are said to have sat on them to plot the downfall of the @entity66			1
@entity8 billionaire @entity67 bought the struggling football club in 2006 and decided to give the boardroom a makeover			2
the builder told @entity28 expert @entity72 : ‘ @entity21 were taken over by a new owner and decided to modernise the interior of the stadium			1
owner : when @entity77 , left , bought the club the chairs , seen with expert @entity72 , were put into a skip but were saved and have been kept in storage for the last seven years ‘ my company actually carried out the works , and to my horror , these – and a table – were literally in the skip			1
‘ there are 14 chairs and i believe it ’s a five - leafed table , which i ’ve kept in storage for the last seven years			2
‘ i believe it [ the furniture ] was donated by one of the authorities within the @entity20 , because it was originally on @entity17			2
’ miss @entity72 said the chairs – which were worth ‘ thousands of pounds ’ – dated to the mid 19th - century			1
she said : ‘ i would say that these chairs date from around 1860 - 1870			0
they ’re made of oak , and are a very characteristic kind of yellowish colour that you find in the 19th century			0
historic : built at a cost of £ 377,000 in 1860 , @entity17 was @entity14 's first armour - plated , iron - hulled ship @entity62 and @entity63 , right , sat on the chairs as they drew up battleplans in @entity60 ‘ stylistically they certainly fit with the period of @entity17 , which was commissioned in 1861			1
’ the builder said he hoped to give the valuable furniture back to the club when the current owners had ‘ changed their taste ’			2
@entity17 was built for the @entity20 in 1859 - 61			0
she and her sister ship @entity119 were the first armour - plated , iron - hulled warships , and were built in response to @entity123 ’s launching in 1859 of the first ocean - going ironclad warship , the wooden - hulled @entity126			0
@entity17 became obsolete after the 1871 launching of the mastless and more capable devastation			0
she served as a storeship and depot ship , and in 1904 was assigned to the @entity20 ’s torpedo training school			0
in 1979 , the ship was donated to the @entity133			0
after it was restored , it returned to @entity21 as a museum ship			0
troubles : @entity21 has had more than its fair share of financial troubles known as @entity21 , @entity21 is much loved by its fans who have accompanied it through every up and down of the club 's history			1
and there have been plenty of them since it was founded in 1898			0
as far back as 1976 , the club found itself in danger of bankruptcy and so had to sell off players to keep afloat			2
as their fortunes waned , so too did their luck , and @entity21 went from the @entity152 to the @entity153 and up to the @entity154 in 1986 - 87			0
by the following season they were in financial trouble again and were relegated back to the @entity152 , and less than 10 years later @entity157 was able to buy the club for £ 1			1
in 1998 the club went into administration , a century after it was founded , but was rescued by a rich new @entity162 owner @entity161			0
@entity67 bought the club in 2006 and pumped large amounts of cash into it , and in 2008 they won the @entity167			0
however since then the club has had to go into administration twice			0
in april this year it was bought by the @entity170 , which enabled it to exit administration .			0

club known as @entity21 has gone through one financial crisis after another
*bosses* threw oak chairs and tables worth thousands of pounds onto street
a builder found them in a skip in 2006 and took them on @entity28 and he hopes one day the club will take them back
experts told him they had been made for @entity17 150 years ago
