@entity1 's children 's commissioner @entity0 has blasted @entity2 , calling him ' a d * * * head ' and cruel ' for disciplining his daughter by feeding her one of the world 's hottest chilis			1
the celebrity chef admitted on monday that because ' you ca n't smack naughty kids ' when one of his four young children became unruly or disrespectful , he would coat their sliced apple with a type of chili known as the scotch bonnet			1
scotch bonnets have a rating on the @entity20 scale , which measures chili heat , of 100,000 to 350,000 , making them up to 140 times hotter than a normal chili pepper			1
speaking with @entity26 's @entity25 , mr @entity0 said , ' he 's a d * * * head @entity28			1
it 's just not appropriate to use cruelty as a form of discipline			2
' mr @entity0 went on to say that @entity2 's chili trick was a form of ' child abuse '			1
' if he 's joking it 's not even appropriate because some parents and families might think it 's a legitimate or alternative way of disciplining children			1
he 's way off the planet as far as i 'm concerned			2
' mr @entity0 was responding to @entity2 's extraordinary confession about how he disciplines his children , saying on monday , ‘ i give them chillies for punishment			1
it is not very popular beating kids any more , it ’s not very fashionable and you are not allowed to do it and if you are a celebrity chef like me it does not look very good in the paper			2
so you need a few options			0
' a scorcher : the ' scotch bonnet ' chili ( pictured ) that @entity2 feeds his children is 140 hotter than a normal pepper @entity2 said he had once tricked his 12 - year - old daughter into eating an ultra-hot @entity77 , much to the annoyance of his wife , @entity38			1
at the @entity81 @entity80 , @entity2 said : ‘ @entity41 was quite disrespectful and rude to me and she pushed her luck			1
in my day i would have got a bit of a telling - off but you are not allowed to do that			2
‘ five minutes later she thought i had forgotten and i had n’t			0
she asked for an apple			2
i cut it up into several pieces and rubbed it with @entity77 and it worked a treat			1
she ran up to mum and said , “ this is peppery ”			0
i was in the corner laughing			0
[ @entity38 ] said to me , “ do n’t you ever do that again ”			0
’ mr @entity0 , who is @entity1 's @entity98 , said @entity2 's role as an educator made his actions even more troubling			1
' he purports to be a teacher and a role model and works with children			0
if he worked in a school in @entity1 they 'd sack him , ' he said			1
' if you were cruel to children in that way here in @entity1 in a school you 'd get sacked			1
it 's a way of assaulting children			1
' given his struggle to impose order on daughters @entity120 , @entity121 , 11 , and @entity122 , five , and son @entity123 , four , perhaps it is no surprise @entity2 is not keen to add to his family			2
he revealed he argued with his wife of 14 years about the idea , saying : ‘ you know what she said last night ? she is 40 in about ten days and i took her out and she goes , “ ok are we going to have another kid then ? ” i said , “ you what ? ”			0
the family pose together for the december issue of @entity139 magazine , where the couple talk about family life ‘ the woman wants another baby			0
but with all the power in my body we are not having another baby			0
’ he admitted , however , that mrs @entity149 usually wins the arguments at home – even about food			0
he said : ‘ my wife loves a destroyed steak			0
i have been with her since i was 18 years old , how romantic , but it is hard to keep loving someone when they want a well - done steak			0
i have tried to tell her but she is a very single - minded , dominant woman			0
’ the couple – who have a combined wealth of £ 240million – met when they were 17			0
the chef drove to a cinema , but crashed the car			0
he has joked she started dating him out of pity as a result			0
mrs @entity149 , a former model , has worked as her husband ’s pa and now designs children ’s clothing			2
@entity2 , who was named as a @entity172 at the @entity174 awards last week , said his wife @entity38 has asked whether they can have another child - their fifth - but the chef has said no			1
