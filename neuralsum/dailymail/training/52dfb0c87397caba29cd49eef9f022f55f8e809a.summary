but when she collected @entity12 in the afternoon , she found her child had n't been allowed to eat the chicken salad sandwich , houmous , carrots and a chocolate bar in her lunch box			1
ms @entity6 , a single mother and former nursery worker , said : ' when i picked her up at the end of the day the first thing she said to me was , " mummy i 'm really hungry , can i have my lunch now ? " ' i went to speak to the manager and i said " why was n't my daughter allowed her lunch " and she said " we did n't know it was healthy "			1
' and she said " the form was wrong , you were n't meant to send a lunch as it is provided here			2
we gave her a small portion of spaghetti pasta and an apple "			0
' and she said we did n't know if it 's halal			2
' i said we are a @entity60 family and it was a chicken sandwich			0
' and she said " we do n't allow any non-halal meat in the nursery "			2

it is often used to indicate food – particularly meat – that has been prepared in accordance with @entity80 principles and techniques			0
in @entity156 , killing an animal without prior stunning is illegal , but the law gives special exemption to @entity80 and @entity160 meat producers on the grounds of religion			0
