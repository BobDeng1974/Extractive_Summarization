the brother of an apparent street beggar who became an internet star for spending $ 100 on food for other people claims his ' mentally unstable ' sibling chose to be homeless and is awaiting a $ 150,000 inheritance			1
@entity7 also said the man the internet knows as @entity10 - whose online donation kitty has received more than $ 135,000 from members of the public - is actually named @entity14 , or @entity15 , and that he wants people to know ' it 's all a scam ' so that the donated money can go to those who actually need it			1
' he 's sitting on money - he 's sitting on an estate , ' mr @entity14 told @entity23 @entity22			1
' he chose this way of life			0
' this money needs to go to real people - people who have fallen down			0
' mr @entity14 says his brother is an alcoholic who lived with their parents up until their death recently , and that he is waiting on $ 150,000 from their estate			1
he suggested his sibling chose to live on the streets as he waits for the money			0
however he believes that his sibling may have been ' manipulated ' into filming the video			0
the claims come after a witness spoke out about seeing the filming of the video by @entity62 prankster @entity49 , who claims to have given ' @entity10 ' $ 100 cash and then secretly followed him to a liquor store , where he bought food and gave it to homeless people in a park			1
nursing student @entity68 , 26 , said he was outside the liquor store on the day in question and he saw @entity49 - who he recognized from his previous videos - in the driver 's seat of a car			1
in the passenger seat , he claims , was @entity10			2
' i was there , they did n’t ‘ follow ’ him , ' @entity68 told @entity23			0
' they drove him there ( to the liquor store )			1
' i think the manner in how they portrayed the entire video is deceitful and dishonest			0
' a spokesperson for @entity49 told @entity86 on friday that @entity7 's statements to the media are ' totally untrue '			1
' the video wants not staged , ' the spokesperson , @entity89 , said			0
@entity10 gave an interview to @entity92 insisting that to him it was ' all a surprise ' and he had never met @entity49 before he was handed the $ 100			1
gesture ... with an agenda ? skeptics have picked holes in a viral video showing a homeless man spending a $ 100 donation on food for his beggar friends , deeming it a ' fake ' creation that was focused on making money he told the news channel : ' i appreciate it , most definitely			1
it 's all a surprise to me			0
i thought this was just a project video , i had no idea this was going where it went			0
@entity10 added : ' normally people give you a dollar , maybe five as a big tip , but a hundred , wow that 's a week 's worth			2
' @entity49 said he initially set out to ' expose homeless people ' in @entity22 by giving them cash in the expectation that they will spend it on alcohol			1
however , @entity10 proved to be an exception			2
instead , he spent the money on food to share with his friends , prompting @entity49 to return and surprise @entity10 with a @entity129 meal , makeover and a night in a hotel			1
the feel - good video spawned an @entity133 page - believed to be run by @entity49 - for @entity10 to get his life back on track , which as of friday had a total of $ 135,028			1
but critics have pointed to a number of flaws in the footage , as well as the hefty profit @entity49 has reportedly made from its success - up to a huge $ 52,000			2
@entity62 users have been skeptical about @entity49 's motivation , suggesting it is a ' set - up ' so he can gain traffic and profit			1
one @entity62 user , with the handle @entity149 , said : ' a large number of @entity62 prank videos are staged , ' he said			2
' i was involved in a bloody eyeball scare prank by @entity155			0
my part of the video was staged ... me getting scared by @entity49			2
using chopsticks : @entity49 captioned this photo of @entity160 to eat @entity161 in this @entity129 eve ' twist : the short film sees ' serial prankster ' @entity155 give $ 100 to a beggar named @entity10 in @entity22 , @entity166 - only for him to walk into a @entity167 ( left ) and buy food for his struggling friends ( right ) ' i asked him if he could give me a shout - out and put my name in the description below so i can get some traffic to my @entity62 channel , but it never happened			1
' so now i 'm addressing this issue due to a number of @entity62 pranksters getting exposed for making stage pranks			0
' other users have claimed that homeless feel - good films are a sure - fire way of boosting traffic - and consequently , money , via advertisements - on the social networking site			0
' they go to a homeless person and make a feel - good video because they know that 's going to get views , ' said one @entity62 user , referring to the site 's personalities , such as @entity49			1
skepticism : now , viewers have questioned the video 's authenticity , citing a number of ' flaws ' in the footage			0
above , @entity49 is pictured in a @entity201 photo			0
he is well - known for producing ' prank ' videos for @entity62 indeed , in november 2013 , @entity49 gave another homeless man $ 100 and told an actor playing a beggar to approach him to ask for money for food			1
again , the real beggar handed over some cash			0
the user , with the handle ' 24/7 rants ' , claimed the start of @entity49 's recent homeless video - which sees the director hand @entity10 $ 100 , before secretly following him with a camera - immediately suggests it may be a hoax			1
speaking in his own video , he said @entity49 could not possibly have guaranteed the man was going to pick up his things and spend the money immediately , instead of remaining by the roadside			2
' how did he know he was going to spend the money immediately ? he had no idea , ' he said			0
he also picked holes in the claim that @entity10 did not notice the camera - nor @entity49 ( who has a distinctive haircut ) - following him throughout the duration of his trip to a nearby @entity167			2
after shopping at the @entity167 , @entity10 was filmed emerging with bags filled with food , before going straight to a park , where he handed out the goods to a number of homeless people			1
wit his new look and wardrobe , @entity10 was treated to a buffet meal at the end of the day by @entity49 however , the user questioned the beggar 's choice of a @entity167 a 34 - minute walk away for his food shop - instead of a nearer , cheaper supermarket - saying : ' it seems like an odd coincidence '			1
' why would this guy , of all places , go to a liquor store to buy chips and pie or whatever when you think that there are tons of other places to go to ... that are convenient , probably cheaper			2
however , @entity49 argued that @entity10 chose the liqour store because it was closest to his begging spot , saying : ' when people see you getting all this traffic they want to bring you down			1
' when questioned by @entity266 , he did not explain why @entity10 chose to drag several bags of food 34 minutes to the park , instead of shopping at least two stores that were closer to the park			1
but he strongly denied staging any of his films or having met @entity274 before the $ 100 exchange			2
' i had little expectation , maybe he would buy alcohol maybe he would n't , ' he said of the video			0
' i wanted to see what a homeless person would spend it on			0
no one has ever done that before			0
' giving : the camera following @entity10 as he hands food to a family in the park he was initially filmed in however , the @entity62 user claimed the number of hits received by @entity49 's previous @entity62 videos - between 600,000 to 800,000 , according to @entity293 , a site that tracks @entity62 channel statistics - could have prompted him to construct what he knew would be a viral hit			1
indeed , @entity49 - who earns money based on how many users view his videos , most of which are ' pranks ' - not only scooped $ 52,000 from the film , but also gained 13,000 new subscribers			2
after the video went viral , @entity49 said on @entity62 : ' i was n't expecting to get this kind of footage			2
to be honest , i thought this video would be more an exposing homeless people video at first			0
' he added : ' i 'm so glad that i could witness and capture such a beautiful moment			0
this has to be one of the most amazing experience so far on this channel			0
in the footage , @entity10 told @entity49 he had quit his job to look after his parents , but after both of them died , he could n't afford to pay for their condo and found himself on the street			1
' the more i talk to him , the more i sense how genuine he is …			0
i gave him my number and told him to call me when he needs help			0
never judge a book by its cover			0
one love ! ' @entity49 said			0
another video : in november 2013 , @entity49 ( pictured , left ) gave another homeless man ( right ) $ 100 and told an actor playing a beggar to approach him to ask for money for food			1
