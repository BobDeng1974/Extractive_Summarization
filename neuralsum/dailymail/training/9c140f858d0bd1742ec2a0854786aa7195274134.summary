despite being six - months pregnant , the sporty royal looked slim as she played basketball and table tennis			0

my friends keep texting me names			0
’ and when asked if she had got her nursery ready , she smiled and said : ‘ no.			0
. we have got a lot to do ! ’ during the visit , @entity8 also got an unusual insight into being a mother – from an eight - month - old baby with a taste for flowers			2
the duchess chatted to @entity65 and her mother @entity66 , who had a bouquet of flowers to give to @entity8 , while they were in a crowd outside a sports centre			2
mrs @entity65 , who represented @entity72 at the hammer throwing in the @entity74 , said : ‘ @entity8 came over after spotting @entity65 and she asked her name and how old she is			2
‘ we said we had flowers for a special someone			0
i told her it was the most amazing experience ahead of her			0
‘ but she needed to be careful because @entity65 was more interested in trying to eat the flowers			0
’ at the shelter , the @entity81 , @entity19 looked awkward when he was asked to do some dj - ing. he joked it was harder than flying a helicopter – and after his attempt at ‘ scratching ’ , @entity8 said to him : ‘ step away from the music ’			1
known as the @entity8 when north of the border , @entity8 often pays tribute to the people of @entity111 by wearing a flash of tartan			2
