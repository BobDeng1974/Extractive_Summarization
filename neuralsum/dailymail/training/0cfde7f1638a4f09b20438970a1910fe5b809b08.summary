in the first @entity1 ? of 2015 , @entity0 delivers his verdict on the big issues in the world of sport , revealing what helped him beat the winter chill and what left him feeling cold inside			2
what 's hot @entity10 during the @entity11 ’ years at @entity13 people used to joke that they liked @entity10 simply because ' he ’s not @entity14 ' and even the older sibling has softened enough to laugh at that one these days			1
this week , though , brother @entity10 has shot up further in my estimation in the wake of his embarrassing revelation to @entity21 ’s @entity20 that he had never made a cup of coffee in his life			1
@entity10 , who was a @entity13 coach under @entity25 last season ( right ) , proved he was game for a laugh when he posted a picture on @entity30 in response to his wife 's revelations about household chores @entity10 's wife @entity35 landed him in it when she went on the radio but the @entity39 man saw the funny side lampooned widely and without mercy , @entity10 ’s domestic shame was deepened when his own wife @entity35 appeared on @entity44 to reveal that @entity10 had never used any of their household cleaning appliances either			1
faced with such embarrassment , @entity10 had a simple choice : @entity50 in a broom cupboard - provided he knows where it is - and wait for the storm to pass or join in the laughter			1
his decision to subsequently post a photo of himself on @entity30 alongside mop , hoover and cleaning trolley spoke volumes for a self - awareness lacking in too many sportsmen these days			1
@entity10 : more than just @entity14 - lite			1
@entity63 thirteen months ago i sat at the @entity65 as @entity63 headed back to the pavilion in the first innings of the second @entity68 having scored a modest 29			1
after a poor and controversial @entity68 summer in @entity69 that year - where he averaged 23 and tried to punch @entity70 in a @entity72 bar - i was confident enough to @entity30 that he : ' will never be a @entity68 batsman			1
' since that day in @entity74 , @entity63 has played 24 test innings and scored 83 not out , 60 , 112 , 9 , 25 , 16 , 16 , 12 , 115 , 70 , 66 , 135 , 145 , 133 , 29 , 19 , 58 , 145 , 102 , 29 , 6 , 0 , 40 and 101			1
@entity63 celebrates scoring a ton in the fourth test against @entity78 at @entity79 @entity63 kissed the ground after scoring 63 runs at the ground where @entity83 was fatally injured to save you reaching for the calculator , that represents an average of 63.7			1
those tests have been played against @entity69 , @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity78 , the quartet who - along with the @entity93 themselves - make up the top - five @entity68 teams in the world			2
what ’s more , his latest century this week came at the same @entity79 where @entity63 watched his great friend @entity83 lose his life just two months ago			1
@entity63 is 28 and makes his runs in the most testing environment the game can offer , from the top of the batting order			1
looks like i was wrong			2
@entity107 even the most optimistic among us have days when we do n’t feel very , well , optimistic			0
welcome to the career of @entity110			0
prior to this campaign , the 25 - year - old had spent three seasons at a @entity115 club without scoring a single goal or indeed making a start			0
ostensibly a @entity119 player during their three years in the top division between 2009 and 2012 , @entity107 spent most of that time being shunted around @entity122 clubs on loan			0
@entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity110 and @entity128 all found a peg in their dressing room for @entity107 during those three years			0
@entity107 opened his account for the season with a goal in the @entity135 draw with @entity136 his own club ? @entity139 , no thanks			2
last season , @entity107 - benefiting from the sale of @entity142 to @entity143 - eventually got his career moving at @entity110 , forming a partnership with @entity146 that drove the @entity148 club to promotion to the @entity115			2
then , in march , he bust his knee			0
so , that @entity115 start - that moment of validation - still awaits him			0
but he was back on the pitch on monday night , fit again and scoring in the @entity135 against @entity136			0
on saturday , @entity110 are at home to @entity143			0
keep an eye on the team sheet …			0
. what 's not @entity158 when the owners start sending their spies to watch training and - even worse - begin asking your players about you then it ’s time to put the house up for sale and make sure you have n’t left any money down the side of the seat in the company car			1
for @entity173 manager @entity158 , the writing may just be on the wall at the @entity175			1
@entity177 ’s revelations in @entity21 that the @entity173 hierarchy are showing attention to detail in terms of their manager ’s day - to - day workings may not concern supporters as much as a run of results that goes llldddlwwllldldddld all the way back to mid-september but they do add to the feeling that @entity158 ’s second coming by the @entity189 may be short			1
@entity158 's days as @entity173 manager appear to be numbered after a miserable run of results there wo n’t be many people in @entity69 - except maybe in @entity195 - who would n’t wish a former @entity69 captain well but @entity158 ’s appointment always looked optimistic from the start			1
the emotional appeal was obvious for @entity173 but did @entity158 really have the credentials to take the job on in the first place ? his managerial cv contained two seasons in the @entity115 with @entity206 ( 14th and 15th ) and a spell as coach of the @entity209			1
prior to this season he had never worked in the @entity122			2
that would be a ‘ no ’ then			0
football tourists i write this item from a position of disadvantage			2
i am 5ft 6in tall			0
therefore anyone - and it ’s just about everybody these days - holding a camera phone above their head at a concert , sporting event or museum - yes , that does happen - will receive black marks and possibly a nudge at the back of the knee from me			0
imagine , therefore , the horror at seeing football fans turning up at @entity115 grounds with selfie sticks this season			1
a @entity136 fan is caught on television brandishing a selfie stick while celebrating a goal @entity239 boxer @entity238 ( holding the stick ) appears to be a fan of the new gadget they 're fine in @entity244 - just do n't bring them to @entity115 matches for the uninitiated , the selfie stick is a long piece of metal you can attach your camera phone to the end of			2
when held out in front of you , it gives you an ability to take photos of yourself from a range and angle that previously only mr @entity260 had enjoyed			0
fine , perhaps , for a day out in @entity261 but not , one would guess , for an afternoon at the football when it ’s quite possible there may just be someone sitting behind , alongside or in front of you			2
happily , @entity267 and @entity136 have taken the lead in banning these monstrous things			0
if other clubs follow suit we may finally be able to return to our national sport to those who are actually interested in watching it			0
@entity276 a stunning score of 77 from 37 balls for @entity279 in @entity74 ’s marvellous ‘ @entity281 ’ competition should stand out as one of the young @entity285 all - rounder ’s top career moments			0
sadly , @entity276 ’ efforts may only prompt him to ask himself just why he is not in the @entity69 squad for the forthcoming @entity289			0
@entity276 was on fire for @entity279 , hitting 77 from 37 balls against @entity291 he may have his allies on @entity30 - though an endorsement from @entity294 is not necessarily worth the phone it ’s written on these days - but , among the @entity69 selectors , notice has understandably been taken of the 23 - year - old ’s relatively poor international form and question marks over his discipline			1
certainly @entity276 emerged from last winter ’s @entity68 debacle as a positive , displaying skills and attitude that appeared quite beyond some of his senior colleagues			0
@entity294 , on @entity30 , questioned why @entity276 was not going to the @entity289 with @entity69 since then , however , the @entity309 all - rounder will maybe have learned that it takes more than the ability to throw , catch and hit a ball to become an established international cricketer			2
hopefully , while basking in the deserved praise that has followed his terrific innings , he will listen not to those with axes of their own to grind on social media but to the voices inside that will no doubt be reminding him that he has not done himself justice since his rise to prominence in @entity74 last january .			0

@entity10 posted a picture on @entity30 showing himself doing chores
@entity63 scored another test century to continue his wonderful form
@entity158 is struggling to stop @entity173 's season unravelling
tourists are *ruining* football 's *atmosphere* with their selfie sticks
