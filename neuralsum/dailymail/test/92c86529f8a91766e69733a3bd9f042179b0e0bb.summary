mr @entity0 , who wore a hearing aid and was described as ' frail ' , arrived after her and the pair bumped into each other in a food aisle			2
mr @entity48 said : ' it appears there was something of a gridlock in the aisle and the defendant could not get past him			0
' there may have been a clash between his basket and her trolley and a few words exchanged			0
' but the upshot was that @entity38 , perhaps out of a sense of frustration , deliberately rammed mr @entity0 with her trolley and the result was to knock him to the floor			1
