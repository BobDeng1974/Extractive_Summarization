by @entity0 published : 19:32 est , 7 december 2013 updated : 19:32 est , 7 december 2013 furious animal - lovers are threatening to boycott the @entity2 after the charity abandoned a free service reuniting owners with missing pets			1
distraught owners who call @entity9 ’s largest animal charity to report lost pets are now being directed to a little - known website where they have to pay to post details of their missing animals			1
until this month , people who reported lost pets or strays to the @entity2 national hotline or online would typically have the pet ’s details passed on to the charity ’s network of local centres and branches			1
furious animal - lovers are threatening to boycott the @entity2 after the charity abandoned a free service reuniting animals with missing pets ( file picture ) but now , callers are referred to the pets located website – run by an animal - lover businesswoman based in @entity33 – which charges £ 12 to log lost pets , though listings for ‘ found ’ pets are free			1
the @entity2 – which has been accused of ignoring the plight of animals while it pursues ‘ naked political campaigns ’ on issues such as fox - hunting – said the change was to free up its cruelty hotline to deal with calls relating to sick , injured or suffering animals			1
but many of the charity ’s supporters are mystified as to why it has entered into the new arrangement when there are numerous pet websites already providing free lost and found services			2
@entity54 , an @entity2 volunteer in @entity55 , said : ' i do n’t see why anyone should spend money on something you can get free			2
we work our socks off to fund raise funds and help people with pets			0
this will give the @entity2 a bad name			2
’ dog - lover @entity68 , 50 , from @entity70 , is threatening to cancel her direct debit to the @entity2			2
she said : ‘ the pets located scheme charges distraught owners for listing their dogs , when there are well - organised sites offering this service for free			1
’ fees : the pets located website where animal lovers are charged to find lost pets critics have posted comments on social networking sites such as @entity87 suggesting the new arrangement must be an @entity2 money - making ploy , a claim the charity has denied			1
@entity92 , from @entity93 , said : ‘ it really does not go down well for the @entity2 to recommend a website which is charging people when they are most vulnerable			2
’ and @entity97 complained on the pets located facebook page : ‘ cashing in on distraught pet owners is disgusting			1
you guys should be ashamed			0
’ the change has also sparked confusion as to why the charity did not approach the @entity9 ’s leading pet matching service , @entity106 , which has reunited 30,000 owners with their pets			2
heartbreak : missing terrier @entity109 - her owner received only nine possible matches at @entity114 @entity106 also traces cats , horses and other animals and has 10,000 volunteers who search for missing pets and help console owners			0
other free sites include @entity122 search @entity9 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , my @entity126 , @entity128 and @entity129			0
@entity130 , 62 , from @entity131 , spent £ 24 hoping pets located could help trace her beloved terrier , @entity109 , who has been missing since september 2011			1
she said : ‘ it ’s a useless website			0
i ’ve never had an email and i do n’t know why the @entity2 is using it			0
it would n’t even let me register all of @entity109 ’s distinctive markings and i got only nine possible matches			0
’ this compared with up to 40 matches on other websites , where no fees were charged			0
@entity143 , 43 , who founded @entity114 and runs a separate telemarketing company in @entity145 , @entity33 , insisted there were no financial ties between her companies and the charity			0
she added : ‘ it is possible someone only received nine matches			0
that could be because the person only asked to be told about close matches or it could be people have not found the dog matching that description			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity2 – which receives around £ 100 million a year in donations – said it had chosen pets located over a year ago as the only national service with ‘ the most efficient website reuniting all animals with their owners , not just dogs or cats ’ .			1
