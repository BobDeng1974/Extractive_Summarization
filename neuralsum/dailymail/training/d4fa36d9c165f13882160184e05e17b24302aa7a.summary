by @entity0 a transgender man in @entity3 who gave birth to three children after beginning to change from female to male can continue to pursue a divorce , a state appeals court said wednesday in reversing a judge who refused to end the marriage			1
a three - judge panel of the @entity12 ruled that @entity14 's marriage to @entity15 in @entity16 in 2003 is considered valid in @entity3 and concluded it was n't a same - sex union			1
last year , a lower court judge denied the divorce request and ruled that @entity3 's ban on same - sex marriages prevented the marriage from being recognized as valid			1
now @entity14 wants to transition to the single life @entity14 , 40 , began to change sex before the marriage but retained female reproductive organs and became pregnant three times with donated sperm when @entity15 was unable to have children			1
the couple eventually moved to @entity3 and sought a divorce a few years later			1
@entity14 was born a woman in @entity16 and as an adult underwent a double - mastectomy and chest reconstruction surgeries , and began testosterone hormone therapy and psychological treatment to become a man			2

family : @entity14 is pictured here in happier times with his family including wife @entity15 , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 the family court judge also found he had no jurisdiction to handle the divorce request because there was insufficient evidence that @entity14 was a man when he got married , even though he had his @entity16 driver 's license and birth certificate changed to say he was a man			1
the @entity3 appeals court ruled that @entity14 's marriage in @entity16 was valid and noted that he did n't withhold his transgender status from officials in @entity16			2
the panel said it was obligated to let people who get their birth certificates changed to reflect a new gender status the rights connected to their amended status - and doing otherwise would run afoul of equal - protection rights protections			0

' i am somewhat surprised that it did get reversed , because your chances are very minimal on getting things reversed , ' said @entity115 , an attorney for @entity15			0
attorney @entity116 , who represents @entity14 , said the ruling will help his client close this chapter of his life , and it brings legal recognition to his marriage			0
' the state of @entity3 has officially recognized him as a man and that his marriage was valid , and because his marriage was valid , his kids were born in wedlock , which is important to him , ' @entity116 said .			0
