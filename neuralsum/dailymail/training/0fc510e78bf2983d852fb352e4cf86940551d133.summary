he denies the accusations against him but has not been able to clear his name because the complaint was ' informal ' mr @entity5 said he was also in line for a prestigious job at a firm as soon as he graduated			1
but it all came crashing down after his ex-girlfriend lodged an ' informal ' sexual harassment complaint against him at @entity3			1
while the process was supposed to be confidential , details of the complaint leaked and @entity5 says he has been unable to clear his name due to the unspecified nature of the accusations			1
writing in the @entity40 , @entity5 said that if the allegations had been lodged on a formal basis , it would have automatically triggered a fact - finding investigation			0
