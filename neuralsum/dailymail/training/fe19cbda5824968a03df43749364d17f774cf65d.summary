by @entity1 reporter published : 09:46 est , 7 march 2013 updated : 17:42 est , 7 march 2013 a @entity3 doctor sent his pregnant patient an email saying that he would call the police and have them force her to the hospital after she refused to give birth to her high - risk child			1
the case is still going on as @entity12 refuses to give in and have a c - section even though that is the way she gave birth to her first four children			1
when mrs @entity12 , 35 , became pregnant with her fifth child , she resolved to have a vaginal birth even though some view that as a more difficult and potentially complicated process after having given birth via caesarean four previous times			1
she brushed those concerns away and stuck to her plan to give birth naturally , but the moment where she got truly upset was when her physician , dr @entity53 , sent her the threatening note in an effort to push her into action			2
' i am deeply concerned that you are contributing to a very high probability that your fetus will die or your child will incur brain damage if born alive			2
at this time , you must come in for delivery , ' dr @entity53 wrote in the letter			2
he is the chairman of the @entity67 's obstetrics and gynecology department , and though he initially agreed to take mrs @entity12 on as a patient and help her towards a vaginal birth , the circumstances have changed			2
' i would hate to move to the most extreme option , which is having law enforcement pick you up at your home and bring you in , but you are leaving the providers of @entity67 / @entity77 no choice , ' he wrote			0
expert : dr @entity53 is the head of obstetrics at the @entity67 hospital and he sent her an email saying he would call police if mrs @entity12 did n't go to the hospital immediately ' in a couple of hours there are going to be cops on my doorstep taking me away from home — in front of my children — to force me into having surgery			2
' instead of sending her speeding out to the hospital , mrs @entity12 got angry and reportedly told the @entity42 that she called a support group called @entity97 for @entity98 because she felt his actions were illegal			0
the group sided with her in spite of the fact that multiple doctors told her that her baby was in distress on tuesday , and that because she had developed gestational diabetes she was at an additionally high risk point in her pregnancy			1
when doctors at the @entity67 hospital told her that she should give birth right then , she determined that their joint concern was unfounded , and felt that it was the wrong time to give birth because no one would be able to watch her 2 - year - old child and her husband was still at work with no way to get to the hospital since she had used the family 's only car			1
the @entity67 would not comment on the issue to @entity124 , saying that they respect patients privacy			0
water views : doctors at @entity67 wanted her to stay and have the baby after an appointment on tuesday but she refused because there would be no one to watch her 2 - year - old child and her husband was unable to get out of work the @entity134 - based advocacy group had a lawyer call the doctor and tell him to stop his threats against mrs @entity12			1
' the threat he was making was both legally and ethically unjustifiable , ' the group 's attorney @entity138 said told @entity124			0
' the problem is not that her doctor recommended that she have a caesarean section ; the problem is that her doctor threatened her with arrest if she did n't have a caesarean section			0
' excited : mrs @entity12 posted a video of the moment that she told her husband that she was pregnant with their fifth child = ms @entity138 said that expectant mothers in @entity3 have extra reason to be nervous about the threat of law enforcement involvement , as two infamous cases stand out as warning signs			1
in the 1990s , a woman named @entity160 wanted to have a @entity161 ( @entity161 ) and wanted to have the child at home with the aid of a midwife			0
because she became dehydrated , ms @entity160 went to a local hospital to get treated for that before returning to her home to have a natural birth			1
once doctors learned of her plans , they sent a sheriff to her home to force her to have a c - section at the hospital			1
another case occurred more recently in 2009 , when @entity178 wanted to ask for a second opinion about whether or not she was going to miscarry as she was experiencing symptoms at the 25th week in the pregnancy			0
rather than provide her with a second opinion , doctors got a court order to keep her on bedrest at the hospital for the rest of the pregnancy			2
she was eventually had a c - section , at which time doctors realized that the child had already died			1
even though mrs @entity12 has been so adamantly opposing having a c - section for the fifth time - repeatedly refusing various doctor 's suggestions and even going against the news that her baby boy is not in an ideal position for a vaginal birth - she went ahead and scheduled one on friday			1
' honestly , i feel abandoned			0
there has to be a level of trust between provider and patient , and that has been betrayed , ' she told the @entity42			0
in light of the legal action , dr @entity53 sent a follow - up email saying that he will not send the police to get her but he remains convinced that ' you and your child are in jeopardy '			0
borderline : @entity220 famously had her fourth c - section with her daughter @entity222 , pushing what many doctors believe is the upper limit for how many caesaraen procedures many women can undergo while the idea of having a natural birth seems like a woman 's right , there are some serious health concerns in this particular situation because of mrs @entity12 's history of having four prior @entity237 operations			1
and the practice is common , since 29.1 per cent of all births in the @entity240 in 2005 were via caesarean			0
the practice of having a @entity243 ( @entity161 ) has dropped significantly in popularity and practice after a damning 1999 study			0
the greatest risk that @entity161 poses is uterine rupture , as the scar tissue that forms around a woman 's womb during a c - section could rip during a natural birth , which could cause ' a catastrophic risk to the mother and baby '			1
because the scar tissue can harden over time , many doctors consider three the ' safe ' upper limit for having c - sections , with four instances happening from time to time but still a rarity			2
one of the most noted instances of the procedure is that of @entity220 who famously had her fourth c - section procedure when she gave birth to her daughter @entity222			1
according to consultant obstetrician and gynecologist @entity267 , a fourth @entity237 — or even a fifth or sixth — is not the automatic health disaster many people assume it to be , although risks do exist			0
' caesarean surgeries become more dangerous for the mother the more surgeries you have ... there is an increasing risks to the baby but the risks to the mother also becomes significant , ' attorney @entity273 told @entity124 .			0

@entity3 mom , 35 , is pregnant with her fifth baby
gave birth to her first four children via c - section but wants a natural birth this time even though multiple doctors said it is a high - risk pregnancy
