@entity2 v @entity0 will be the biggest fight of all time financially and the most significant this century			1
evaluating the greatest ever fights is a complex variable of several factors including not only the quality and excitement of the action but the political , social and cultural undertones , the scale of expectation and outside influences			0
where @entity14 v @entity0 comes to rank among the most important fights in ring history will depend upon what happens that coming night in the @entity19			1
in this , the fourth in a series of 12 fights that shaped boxing history , i look back on one of the greatest sporting events of all time			1
@entity29 @entity32 v @entity30 @entity33 , @entity34 october 30 , 1974 the fight voted the greatest sporting event of the 20th century			1
the fight which crossed oceans and continents			0
the fight which drove boxing through social barriers			0
the fight which put a shadowy @entity40 on the world map			0
the fight which established @entity30 as the most recognisable human being on @entity43			2
the fight which made @entity32 famous in defeat			0
the fight about which millions of words have been written and movies made			1
a photograph taken on october 30 , 1974 , shows @entity30 ( left ) and @entity32 ( right ) @entity48 's @entity32 ( right ) approaches his compatriot @entity30 ( left ) during the iconic @entity29 in 1974 the @entity29 was the brainchild of promotional genius @entity50 backed by the multi-million dollar investment through which @entity34 president @entity53 hoped to excite his people into keeping him in power			1
@entity50 had persuaded @entity30 and @entity32 to sign $ 5million contracts which he could not afford but would talk president @entity53 into bank - rolling			1
@entity59 v @entity30 march 8 , 1971 , @entity60 , @entity61 @entity64 v @entity62 july 4 , 1910 , @entity65 , @entity66 @entity68 v @entity67 june 22 , 1938 , @entity69 , @entity61 as the 25 - year - old world heavyweight champion with enormous punching power @entity32 was odds - on favourite to crush the brilliance of the man they called @entity77 but who , at 32 and diminished by his three - and - a - half - year banishment from the ring for refusing to go to war in @entity81 , was perceived as a fading force			1
@entity30 went to work on @entity32 ’s psyche from the moment the circus arrived in @entity33 , turning up at his training session to mock @entity32 for his size and make fun of his intellect			2
the irritating effect on @entity32 was prolonged after he suffered an eye - cut in sparring , the date of the fight was put back more than a month and @entity50 , fearful of cancellation , insisted they stayed in @entity34 instead of taking a break back in @entity48			2
@entity30 also charmed the local population , who happily took to the streets throughout those weeks chanting ‘ @entity102 ’ – ‘ @entity30 , kill him			0
’ the fight developed into a tactical triumph for @entity30 , albeit a self - punishing one which may have contributed to the subsequent onset of @entity108 ’s which afflicts him now			2
@entity30 ( left ) often found himself against the ropes in a strategy which even surprised his trainer @entity111 @entity30 spent much of his time against the ropes , inviting @entity32 to punch himself out before landing his blow in a strategy which he later entitled ‘ @entity120 ’ – and which came as a surprise to everyone including his fabled trainer @entity118 spent much of his time lolling against the ropes , inviting @entity32 to punch himself out			2
@entity32 duly obliged by throwing hundreds of blows in the first seven rounds			0
@entity30 evaded many of those punches and blocked numerous with his arms but he had to withstand the brute force of those which got through his defences			0
the verbal taunting went on			0
‘ they told me you could punch , @entity32 , ’ he said as @entity32 began to flag			0
‘ is that all you got , @entity32 ? ’ he rasped as @entity32 connected to the @entity30 chin with virtually the last of the punches which had knocked out many a former foe			2
it had not been all negative			0
throughout , @entity30 had peppered the swelling @entity32 face with break - out with lightning combinations and the steamy 4 am heat had contributed to the weakening process			1
@entity32 , the world heavyweight champion , is down on count two after being struck by @entity30 's right - hander @entity30 looks on after he knocked @entity32 to the canvas with the holy mother of all right - handers during the bout come the eighth round , come the coup de grace			1
a succession of right hooks , a two - fisted burst and then a left - hook which straightened up @entity32 to receive the holy mother of all right - handers			0
@entity32 staggered to his feet at the count of nine but referee @entity157 knew he was finished			0
astonishment around the satellite world			2
@entity32 would eventually emerge from denial to become @entity30 ’s great friend , an inspiring @entity164 preacher and the seller of countless top - of - the - range barbecues			1
@entity30 's staff and the referee put their arms around @entity30 after he settled the @entity29 in 1974			1

@entity2 v @entity0 is now just nine days away
