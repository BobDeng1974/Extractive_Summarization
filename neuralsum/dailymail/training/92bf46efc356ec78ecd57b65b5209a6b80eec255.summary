@entity1 , pictured left with his former fiancee @entity48 , with whom he has a son , was dumped by @entity72 by text message on the day of the crash ' it 's bad enough that he has convicted of one drink driving offence but to be convicted three times just shows how volatile and immature this man really is			1
' people like him should stop moaning about their life in the spotlight and work with charities like us so they can see first hand the terrible and tragic effects drink driving can have on people 's lives			1
' my son was killed by a drink driver yet here is this man complaining that he went drink driving because he was under stress due to his love life and being in the public eye			1
' he needs to get his priorities right and he should at the very least have recieved a short prison sentence and a ten year ban to make sure he learns his lesson			2

' i do n't want to mention in open court with the press here , but it was a very distressing thing they both suffered			0
