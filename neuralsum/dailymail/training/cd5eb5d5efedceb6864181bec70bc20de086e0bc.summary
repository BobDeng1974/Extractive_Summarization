an @entity1 actor has embarked on a radical diet for 60 days to highlight the shocking amount of sugar in low - fat supermarket products - and the dramatic effect they can have on your health			1
@entity10 , perhaps best known for his role as a @entity13 drug mule in the second season of @entity15 , spent two months eating so - called ' healthy ' foods such as juice , cereal and sports drinks for a documentary called that @entity21			1
but @entity10 quickly discovered that appearances can be deceiving and before long started to experience some alarming health difficulties such as fatty liver disease and mental instability			1
prior to filming @entity26 had spent three years shunning all sugary products from his diet - and slowly re-introduced them as an experiment			1
on average people are consuming a whopping 40 teaspoons of sugar a day - more than four times the recommended daily intake - but it 's often hidden in places we do n't expect			2
even by cutting out soft drink , confectionery , icecream and other obvious offenders within just a few weeks @entity26 had begun to exhibit signs of fatty liver disease			1
' this is the first time i 've seen that it can be developed in two or three weeks ' , one doctor says , shocked at the results			2
@entity10 said he felt very unwell , was lethargic and very short - tempered on the diet more than six million @entity1 suffer from fatty liver disease , but only one in 1000 of those suffer from it due to alcohol intake			1
he also felt lethargic , slow , said he had a short temper and despite ' eating the same amount of calories as i did before and i 'm not feeling full '			2
but retired @entity72 physicist @entity71 says @entity26 's physical wellbeing and appearance is not the only thing that the high - sugar diet is affecting			2
' your mental function is just unstable , ' he says in the trailer			0
another expert warned that it did n't matter what form the sugar comes in , it can be damaging in a high amount			0
' in any sugar , brown sugar , white sugar , fruit juice concentrate from fruit juice ( they all have an ) equal effect on your health , ' he said			0
@entity95 is most famous for his role in the second season of @entity15 , but has branched out to documentary making ' if i keep going to these levels would i be knocking on the door of obesity ? , ' @entity10 asks a doctor at one point in the film , to which she responds : ' definitely , you have n't got far to go			1
' the documentary has been endorsed by heavyweights such as world - famous chef @entity110 who describes it as ' a definite must - see '			0
@entity113 also makes an appearance in the film saying : ' people on this planet are growing sicker every day , and many scientists now believe that fructose has a role to play			0
' @entity121 warns : ' @entity38 is n't evil , but life is so much better when you get rid of it			0
' the documentary has been endorsed by heavyweights such as world - famous chef @entity110 who describes it as ' a defininte must - see ' doctors said @entity10 was on the road to obesity after just a few weeks of the diet speaking to @entity133 on wednesday morning , @entity10 said ' all the sugars that i was eating were found in perceived healthy foods			1
' ' low fat yoghurts and muesli bars , cereals and fruit juices , sports drinks - these kind of things parents will often give their kids thinking they 're doing the right thing , ' @entity10 told the program			0
the actor added that aside from the fact that hidden sugars were having an impact on physical health - as he put on 10 centimetres of visceral fat around his waist - there was also a potentially detrimental mental consequence too			0
the full documentary will be released in march 2015 .			0
