debate : mr @entity1 said @entity2 did not have a ' vast problem ' with illegal immigration the @entity5 was at war over immigration last night after @entity1 accused the @entity8 of trying to stoke up a ‘ sense of fear ’			1
the @entity11 business secretary said conservative ministers were ‘ obsessing ’ about immigration numbers			1
he dismissed reports that there are now more than a million illegal immigrants in this country , saying : ‘ the idea there ’s some vast hidden army of people is almost certainly wrong			1
’ and he attacked a controversial @entity23 poster campaign urging illegal immigrants to ‘ go home or face arrest ’ , questioning whether the targets of the posters would even understand them			1
mr @entity1 said the @entity11 had not been consulted about the van campaign – and suggested it was a cynical attempt by the @entity31 to stoke up public fears about immigration			1
he said : ‘ it was stupid and it ’s offensive			0
it is designed , apparently , to sort of create a sense of fear in the @entity2 population that we have a vast problem with illegal immigration			1
we have a problem , but it ’s got to be dealt with in a measured way by dealing with the underlying causes			0
’ he questioned whether illegal immigrants would have enough of a ‘ sophisticated grasp of @entity47 ’ to be able to read the posters on the vans at a distance			2
his comments grew an angry response from senior @entity8 last night			0
a source close to home secretary @entity54 said : ‘ @entity1 clearly has no idea how to manage illegal immigration			1
’ the source defended the £ 10,000 poster campaign , pointing out it costs an average of £ 15,000 to deport a single illegal immigrant			0
‘ if we can persuade them to go voluntarily there are huge savings to be made			0
if @entity1 does n’t agree with government policy in this area , it is always open to him to resign			2
’ fellow @entity31 @entity84 said the @entity11 appeared to be ‘ divorced from reality ’ on immigration			2
he added : ‘ it is absolute nonsense to suggest anyone is trying to create a climate of fear			0
all @entity1 is doing is repeating the mistakes of the past by trying to close down a frank , honest and constructive debate about illegal immigration			1
’ mr @entity1 also criticised @entity98 ’s pledge to cut annual net immigration from more than 200,000 to under 100,000 , adding : ‘ obsessing about this net immigration figure is not helpful			2
’ the @entity23 ’s illegal immigration initiative was piloted in six @entity72 boroughs last week but could be rolled out nationally if it proves successful			2
the blunt message has also been displayed in leaflets , posters and messages in local newspapers			0
controversial : adverts urging illegal immigrants to go home were driven around @entity72 on vans , but they have only resulted in a total of 11 migrants leaving the country , according to the @entity23 's own figures shadow home secretary @entity116 branded the poster campaign a ‘ cynical stunt ’ and said there was ‘ complete confusion ’ over whether the billboards represented government policy			1
she added : ‘ with no consultation with local communities the government has simply caused offence with these ill - judged ad vans			0
‘ they seem to be aimed at lost @entity31 voters rather than a sensible strategy to tackle illegal immigration			1
‘ now cabinet ministers are openly disagreeing			0
@entity1 is right – they are stupid – but why then is the government sticking by them , instead of getting the basics right with a proper plan for efficient border enforcement ? ’			0
