by @entity0 the sun unleashed a massive @entity3 solar flare over the weekend which could result in spectacular auroras on @entity5 tomorrow			1
the solar flare peaked at 5:48pm gmt ( 1:48 pm edt ) on saturday march 29 causing a brief radio disturbance while generating a series of coronal mass ejections ( @entity10 )			1
cmes are powerful plasma eruptions near the surface of the sun driven by kinks in the solar magnetic field			1
it is not yet clear where auroras will be seen , but it is thought that people living at higher latitudes will be most likely to spot a light show if one emerges			1
scientists , however , believe it will only deliver a ‘ glancing blow ’ and will not seriously affect communication systems			1
‘ the best - guess forecast calls for minor @entity38 - class storms			2
high - latitude sky watchers should be alert for auroras , ' wrote @entity41			0
watch the @entity3 solar flare in action solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost			1
astronauts are not in immediate danger because of the relatively low orbit of this manned mission			0
they do have to be concerned about cumulative exposure during space walks			0
the charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the @entity5 ’s magnetic field			1
very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies			0
a positive aspect , from an aesthetic point of view , is that the auroras are enhanced			0
geomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents			2
as well as blacking out some radio signals for about an hour over the weekend , the solar flare produced radio signals of its own , according to @entity41			1
‘ the explosion above sunspot @entity74 sent shock waves racing through the @entity78 's atmosphere at speeds as high as 11 million mph ( 4800 km / s ) , ’ it said			2
‘ radio emissions stimulated by those shocks crossed the 93 million mile divide to @entity5 , causing shortwave radio receivers to roar with static			1
’ @entity84 , that contained the flare , was active over the weekend , producing three solar flares in total			1
in addition to the @entity3 solar flare on march 29 , two m - class solar flares erupted from the region on march 28 and march 30			1
solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation			2
harmful radiation from a flare can not pass through @entity5 's atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground			1
however -- when intense enough -- they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where gps and communications signals travel			0
this flare is classified as an @entity106 flare			2
x-class denotes the most intense flares , while the number provides more information about its strength			0
an @entity113 is twice as intense as an @entity114 , an @entity112 is three times as intense			0
plasma from the solar flare will graze @entity5 tomorrow causing a possible geomagnetic storm that will create auroras for high - latitude sky watchers a solar flare occurs when magnetic energy that has built up in the solar atmosphere is suddenly released			1
radiation is emitted across virtually the entire electromagnetic spectrum , from radio waves at the long wavelength end , through optical emission to x-rays and gamma rays at the short wavelength end			0
the amount of energy released is the equivalent of millions of 100 - megaton hydrogen bombs exploding at the same time a flare occurs when magnetic energy that has built up in the solar atmosphere is suddenly released - mostly in the active regions around sunspots			1
their frequency varies from several a day , when the sun is particularly active , to less than one a week during quiet periods			0
earlier this week scientists came a step closer to understanding this powerful phenomenon behind solar flares by witnessing , for the first time , the mechanism behind it			2
footage put together by an international team led by @entity155 researchers showed entangled magnetic field lines looping from the sun ’s surface			0
these magnetic lines slip around each other and lead to an eruption 35 times the size of the @entity5 and an explosive release of magnetic energy into space			2
the discoveries of a gigantic energy build - up bring scientists a step closer to predicting when and where large flares will occur			0
‘ we care about this as during flares we can have @entity10 and sometimes they are sent in our direction , ’ said lead author , dr @entity172 from @entity155			0
‘ human civilisation is nowadays maintained by technology and that technology is vulnerable to space weather			0
' ‘ indeed , coronal mass ejections can damage satellites and therefore have an enormous financial cost			0
’ ‘ they can also threaten airlines by disturbing the @entity5 ’s magnetic field			1
very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies			0

the solar flare peaked at 5:48pm gmt ( 1:48 pm edt ) on march 29
it caused a radio disturbance and sent off a plasma cloud that will *hit* @entity5
scientists said it will only deliver a ‘ glancing blow ' to the planet tomorrow and will not seriously affect communication systems
the aurora may be seen at higher latitudes but it is not entirely clear how far south they could be seen
