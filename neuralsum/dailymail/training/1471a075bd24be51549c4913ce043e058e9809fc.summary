a new email exchange between @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 reveals another example how the producer blasted the actress to the @entity8 studio head			1
in the latest leaked exchange , @entity1 criticises @entity3 's planned remake of the classic @entity12 film @entity13			1
@entity1 had earlier described @entity3 as ' a minimally talented spoiled brat			1
' this time however , @entity3 was involved in the exchange , but was occasionally taken off the chain so @entity1 could comment about her behind her back			1
the newest leak from @entity8 's hacked emails come after the film studio canceled its release of ' @entity22 ' - which depicts the assassination and violent of death of @entity27 leader @entity26 - after hackers threatened a 9/11 - style attack on theaters that showed the film			1
@entity39 summed up the prevailing sentiment when he tweeted : ' the hackers won			1
' @entity43 officials say they believe @entity27 is behind the @entity8 hack attack			1
the hermit state called the end of the film ' an act of war			2
' on wednesday , ' @entity22 ' stars @entity50 and @entity52 were both spotted with bodyguards - a clear indication that they were taking the threats about the movie seriously			1
the exchange about @entity3 , which was obtained by @entity58 , begins with @entity1 and @entity59 discussing the possibility of @entity61 directing the planned remake of @entity13			1
at one stage , it seemed that @entity8 had secured the services of @entity66 for the project , which was later abandoned			2
@entity3 appeared so desperate to work with him that she even said to @entity1 : ' let me know if there is anything i should be doing			1
like getting on a plane and begging @entity66			0
' however , the @entity74 - winning director is fully booked until 2016 and could not take on the project			0
later exchanges discuss what impact @entity3 shaving her hair would have on the movie			2
best of friends : despite was has happened , insiders says @entity3 has been one of @entity59 's biggest supporters as hackers release her work emails @entity13 , like most wealthy @entity85 , shaved her head so as not to get lice and wore a wig			1
@entity1 , @entity59 and @entity3 considered whether the actress should be bald for the film 's big sex scenes			1
@entity3 wrote : ' the one thought i would ask you both is about her " bald "			2
i think that made sense in earlier drafts but if we are saying every time she 's in bed she has no hair or a shaved head it changes the sensuality			0
' i wonder if we should keep it out and discuss as an idea with the director			0
but i worry we could scare off a director			0
' @entity1 replied : ' first i thought bald but then i was sitting at home during the night and i could n't sleep because of it so now i think shaved ; or possibly a fade like @entity112			2
' maybe shaved for @entity113 , bald for @entity115 ? and then curly tendrils for the asp ? what do you think ? ' @entity59 liked the perm idea , noting how good @entity3 looked with one in @entity121 , which she described as ' that @entity123 movie about @entity124			0
' all good : the two looked tense when photographed just days after the first email exchange between @entity59 and @entity1 leaked , in which he called her a ' minimally talented spoiled brat ' @entity1 then takes @entity3 out of the email chain and tells @entity59 : ' kill me now			1
' according to the leaked emails , when the remake plan is abandoned , the studio executives consider filming a @entity138 version of the story based on @entity140 and @entity13 , still with the @entity133 actress playing the leading role			1
@entity1 said : ' we ought to make this with her and [ @entity146 ] @entity145 or [ @entity148 ] @entity147 or [ @entity150 ] @entity149 and go home			0
' @entity3 however responds that she thinks the script , by @entity153 , is almost where it needs to be , and she would like to stay the course			0
@entity1 then removes @entity3 from the email chain again , sending a message to @entity59 : ' she 's seriously out of her mind			1
' @entity59 said she was willing to arrange a meeting between the three of them to sort out any potential problems			0
however , @entity1 replied : ' nooooooo noooooo noooooo please ! not a meeting ! ' earlier , @entity1 had described @entity3 as a ' minimally talented spoiled brat ' in a previously leaked email			1
@entity1 eventually apologized for the comments he made in that email , as well as an allegedly racist exchange he had with @entity59 about president @entity169			1
he said : ' private emails between friends and colleagues written in haste and without much thought or sensitivity , even when the content of them is meant to be in jest , can result in offense where none was intended			0
' i made a series of remarks that were meant only to be funny , but in the cold light of day , they are in fact thoughtless and insensitive — and not funny at all			0
to anybody i ’ve offended , i ’m profoundly and deeply sorry , and i regret and apologize for any injury they might have caused			0
' @entity50 , spotted at @entity189 on wednesday with a bodyguard after threats of a september 11 - style attack on movie theaters that showed the ' the interview ' these latest leaks come as the group claiming responsibility for the hack , the @entity197 , have successfully forced @entity8 to abandon plans to release their move ' @entity22 ' , which featured the assassination of @entity27 dictator @entity26			1
the emails also reveal and exchange between @entity8 execs in which a producer reportedly tells ceo @entity208 not to case @entity210 in major films because the star does n't sell tickets well in overseas markets - because worldwide goers are racist			1
@entity216 pulled the planned @entity218 release of the ' the interview ' after the hackers threatened 9/11 - like terror attacks on cinemas showing the comedy			1
a spokesman for the company admitted the $ 42 million movie is unlikely to be rescheduled : ' @entity216 has no further release plans for the film			2
' @entity8 's decision caused some consternation in @entity35 over what has been viewed as an act of voluntary censorship			1
weighing in : writer @entity234 ( above with @entity59 ) said in a statement , ' the @entity43 succumbed to an unprecedented attack on our most cherished , bedrock principle of free speech dark future : director @entity241 ( above ) said in an interview the movie to not release the movie will have a horrible impact on the film industry writer @entity234 said : ' today the @entity43 succumbed to an unprecedented attack on our most cherished , bedrock principle of free speech by a group of @entity27 terrorists who threatened to kill moviegoers in order to stop the release of a movie			1
' the wishes of the terrorists were fulfilled in part by easily distracted members of the @entity43 press who chose gossip and schadenfreude - fueled reporting over a story with immeasurable consequences for the public – a story that was developing right in front of their eyes			2
my deepest sympathies go out to @entity216 , @entity50 , @entity270 and everyone who worked on @entity22			0
' @entity39 tweeted : ' wow			0
an utter and complete victory for them			0
' he later added ; ' @entity277 at @entity278			0
both of us have never seen or heard of anything like this			0
@entity35 has done @entity283 proud today			0
' @entity284 also weighed in , writing ; ' canceling " @entity22 " seems like a pretty horrible precedent to set			0
' @entity286 kept it brief , saying on @entity288 , ' sad day for creative expression			0
' @entity291 's planned movie on @entity292 was also scrapped in response to the ongoing problems with the hermit state			2
federal government officials have said that @entity27 is behind the attack , as has been assumed for the past two weeks , though they are not expected to formally announce this until later this week			2
authorities are also looking into whether or not someone inside @entity8 helped the hackers			2
@entity302 and sweet : ' sad day for creative expression , ' said @entity286 ( above ) in an interview with the @entity305 , director @entity241 voiced his concern over the situation : ' what do they do when someone says the same thing about the @entity312 movie or @entity313 ? ' there may be credible evidence of imminent violence that i do n’t know about			2
but if they do n’t really have that information , how many movies are they willing not to release ? ' our community is based on freedom of expression			0
are we going to suppress ourselves every time someone posts something online ? it ’s a dark future			0
' former @entity328 presidential candidate @entity327 blasted @entity8 executives : ' no one should kid themselves			0
with the @entity8 collapse @entity43 has lost its first cyberwar			2
this is a very very dangerous precedent			0
' @entity8 should release " the interview " online for free so @entity27 ca n't censor @entity43 creativity -- should have @entity27 language version			1

@entity3 is described as ' out of her mind ' by producer @entity1
@entity3 was determined to continue with her planned remake of @entity13
