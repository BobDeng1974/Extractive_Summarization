she has just been named the @entity2 's top style icon and has barely put a louboutin - shod foot wrong since launching her debut label six seasons ago			1
but can you tell the difference between @entity10 's new budget line , @entity11 , and the high street copycats ? her new boutique will be opening in @entity14 this week , displaying @entity10 @entity10 dresses as well as accessories and denim			1
i ’m not sure how many non-famous people could get away with wearing a leather dress outside of my stomping ground of @entity33 , but this was definitely my favourite			2
fit for a duchess : this lilac dress is a little demure for a girl about town , but @entity41 could pull it off @entity11 ’s crepe - silk lilac dress is so genuinely posh i can easily imagine the @entity41 slipping into it for royal functions			1
but it ’s a little demure for a girl tottering about @entity47 and the fabric was so delicate i creased it just by looking at it			2
realistically , only someone with a ladies ’ maid could rely on this dress as a wardrobe staple			2
for the red carpet : one of these almost - identical dresses is 27 times more expensive than the other after years of red carpet events and premieres ( darling ) i thought i ’d developed a serious case of expensive taste , so i was surprised to find i preferred the cheap dress to @entity10 ’s			1
probably a good thing , because although i party with the stars , i do n’t have the budget of one			2
a wag 's whitemare : this ensemble feels a little @entity10 circa 2006 when she was crowned @entity73 @entity72 i did not feel very posh wearing @entity10 ’s bodycon white dress with a sheer panel			1
in fact , i felt like @entity10 circa 2006 , the year she was crowned @entity73 @entity72 at the @entity77 for wearing outfits so skimpy that her boobs practically fell out			1
by comparison , the @entity81 imitation felt almost luxurious			0
both are the kind of dresses i ’d expect to see worn on @entity86 – or at @entity88 ’s infamously naff @entity87 ’ day			0
loving the @entity89 : these little black dresses will make you feel a million dollars and could bag you a footballer i felt a million dollars in this little black dress			0
so much so , i half - expected a multi-millionaire former footballer and national treasure to materialise and take my arm			1
sadly , even this exquisitely made dress could n’t work miracles			0
but if you want to bag a footballer , remember – @entity101 did so in hotpants , not an lbd			0
@entity103 chic : maybe @entity10 thinks that this apron - inspired look will catch on ? at the risk of getting myself struck off the guestlist for @entity10 ’s launch party , i think she has had a private chef for too long			1
she has clearly forgotten what a dinnerlady looks like , or maybe she thinks ‘ @entity113 ’ will catch on			0
then again , i doubt @entity25 does much washing up – perhaps that ’s why she did n’t notice her dress looks like a tea towel			0
