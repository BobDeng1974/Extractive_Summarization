but her bright smile and glamorous outfit on monday night at the pride of @entity13 awards disguised the dramatic health scare she underwent earlier this year which prompted her weight loss			1
the veteran tv presenter , 73 , was diagnosed with blood poisoning and in hospital for ten days on an oral antibiotic and two intravenous ones after slicing through her left index finger with a knife as she cleaned meat from a lamb bone			1
at the time of the accident , @entity25 believed she had a superficial cut that needed nothing more than a plaster			2
two days later however her hand was three times its normal size , hours later she was feverish and found she had an ‘ ominous weal ’ running up the inside of her left arm almost to her armpit			2
taken to @entity39 by her husband of 15 years , celebrity hairdresser @entity38 , doctors immediately hooked her up to a drip and iv antibiotics			1
in an interview in may miss @entity2 revealed : ‘ it was a bit of a shock as i am pretty healthy in general and had no idea that this sort of thing could happen from a simple nick to the finger			1
‘ doctors said it was just one of those things but that bacterial infections from raw or cooked meat are the worst			2
‘ apparently if someone gets playfully scratched by a cat , they should be careful , as those sorts of wounds can develop into infections			0
@entity2 , pictured with her husband @entity38 , at the pride of @entity13 awards ‘ when i first arrived at hospital i did ask a doctor if my kind of infection could be serious and his reply was that before antibiotics had been discovered , people died of this type of blood poisoning , which was sobering			1
‘ in my right arm , which the iv needle was going onto , i developed cellulitis – an infection under the skin – which needed treating as well			0
’ in order to restore her health @entity25 decided to embark on a no sugar , no carbs diet and also took multivitamins and probiotics			0
she described her new eating plan as a ‘ bit like the @entity86			0
i feel a lot better on that kind of diet as it stabilises blood sugar levels			0
’ last night a spokeswoman for @entity25 said : ‘ @entity2 has always looked after herself well and her message has always been about being healthy , especially as she gets older			1
' she eats well , she takes probiotics and multivitamins and she exercises as well			0
she ’ll do a bit of working out , a bit of walking			0
her health is very important to her			0
