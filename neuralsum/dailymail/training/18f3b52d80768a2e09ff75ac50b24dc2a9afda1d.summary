@entity3 @entity2 was crushed under the bale at the equestrian centre and pony club owned by @entity18 on the @entity19 run by her husband @entity20 near @entity7 , @entity21			1
@entity23 had been provided for horses at the stables in a large hay trough - but this was frequently left empty , @entity22 heard			2
instead it had become common practice for customers to go to the hay stack , five bales high , cut open the black plastic wrapping on the bottom bale , and take hay from there for their horses			1
as more hay was taken it lead to the stack becoming dangerously unstable , the court heard			1
on may 31 , 2011 mrs @entity2 , 45 , was killed by a bail at the stables where her daughter , @entity43 , 12 , kept her horse , @entity44			1
the court heard @entity18 was aware of the practice of taking hay from the bottom bale , but failed to recognise the dangers - with tragic consequences			1
@entity18 , 54 , a leading member locally in the @entity50 , admitted at an earlier hearing a single charge under the @entity52 of failing to ensure the safety of persons not in her employment			2
her husband , aged 55 , admitted the same charge relating to another hay stack , not involved in the fatal accident , on a different part of the farm			2
@entity3 @entity63 was crushed under the bale at the equestrian centre and pony club owned by @entity18 ( left ) on the @entity19 run by her husband @entity20 ( right ) the bales of hay , one of which fell and killed @entity70 passing sentence judge @entity71 said : ' on the 31st of may , 2011 @entity3 @entity63 lost her life at the age of 45 in shocking circumstances , witnessed by her 12 - year - old daughter			1
' the family ’s loss ca n’t be under - estimated			0
' referring to @entity18 he added : ' having known hay was being taken from the bottom stack she failed to recognise it represented a risk			1
' it was a tragically wrong assessment and if proper thought had been applied her conclusions would not have been drawn			0
' he gave @entity18 an eight month jail sentence , suspended for two years , with 200 hours unpaid work and ordered her to pay £ 10,000 in prosecution costs			1
the accident happened at @entity91			0
if the health and safety regulations had been followed the death would not have occurred , the court heard her husband was sentenced to a £ 2,500 fine and ordered to pay the same amount in prosecution costs			0
earlier @entity100 , prosecuting , said the @entity101 , married for 29 years with two adult sons , ran the farm with mr @entity104 taking care of the 450 livestock and his wife running the equestrian centre			2
mr @entity104 had originally stacked 220 bales at the equestrian centre on the farm , with 38 left when the accident happened			2
mr @entity100 said mr @entity104 should have taken a bale from the top of a stack so it could be distributed			0
and mrs @entity18 knew people were carrying on an ' unsafe practice ' by taking hay from a bottom bale and this made her ' highly culpable ' he told the court			1
children had also been seen climbing on the bales and taking hay , he said			2
if the health and safety regulations had been followed the death would not have occurred , the court heard			0
' these failures were systemic and persisted over a considerable period of time , ' he added			0
@entity136 , defending @entity18 , whose deceased father was a local farmer , councillor and magistrate , said in mitigation , her passion was horses and the equestrian centre her ' life ’s work '			1
he said @entity18 did not appreciate the risks of people taking hay from the bail as they did			1
' she got it wrong , and of course we know the consequences of that tragic mistake			0
she is devastated by the loss of life and her appearance before the court today			0
' @entity155 , defending @entity104 , said his offence was not related to the death of @entity158 - and related to the collapse of another stack on another part of the farm after the accident happened			0
the court heard the @entity101 had sold their house in @entity166 for a ' substantial sum ' to build another home on their farm			0
but their lawyers said they were heavily indebted and did not make much money from the farm and riding business so could not pay large fines			0
the family of @entity158 are understood to be suing the @entity101 for damages in the civil courts .			0
