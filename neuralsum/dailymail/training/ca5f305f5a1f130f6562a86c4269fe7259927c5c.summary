by @entity0 published : 12:19 est , 21 january 2013 updated : 18:58 est , 21 january 2013 the number of children being admitted to hospital to be treated for asthma attacks has dropped sharply since the smoking ban came into effect			1
experts believe the law may have made smokers more aware of the dangers of second - hand smoke at home			1
this is despite the fact that the legislation only applies to work and public spaces			0
exposure : experts believe exposing children to less second - hand smoke could reduce asthma attacks researchers at @entity24 found @entity26 hospital admissions for children under 14 for asthma attacks fell by 12.3 per cent in @entity29 in the year after july 2007 , when the ban came in			1
in the two subsequent years , admissions were 3.4 per cent lower			0
the study , published in the journal @entity34 , found that the total fall in the three years to july 2010 was equivalent to 6,802 hospital admissions			2
the drop was found in both boys and girls , in homes across all social classes and in both cities and rural areas			0
admissions for severe child asthma attacks had previously been rising from 2002 by 2.2 per cent a year , peaking at 26,969 admissions in the year before the ban			1
asthma affects approximately one in every 11 children in the country			0
in other research , experts have found that hospital admissions for childhood asthma fell after legislation banning smoking in public spaces was introduced in @entity59 and @entity60 , before the law in @entity29			1
dr @entity62 , of @entity24 ’s @entity63 , said : ‘ previous studies have suggested the smoke - free law led more people to abstain from smoking voluntarily at home and in cars			0
‘ we think exposing children to less second - hand smoke in these settings probably played an important role			0
’ immediately following the ban , experts found a 10 per cent fall in heart attacks in @entity29 and it was suggested that older people who never smoked benefited the most			1
it 's hard to recall now , but smoking was banned in bars and cafes less than six years ago previous studies have shown hospital admissions for childhood asthma fell after smoke - free legislation was introduced in @entity59 and @entity60			1
@entity84 , head of policy and public affairs at @entity87 , said : ' it ’s great to see growing evidence of the positive impact of smoke - free legislation			0
' this is something we campaigned for , so it is particularly encouraging that there has been a fall in children ’s hospital admissions for asthma since its introduction			2
' we have long known that smoking and second hand smoke are harmful - they not only trigger asthma attacks which put children in hospital but can even cause them to develop the condition			1
' we ’ve seen the benefits of reducing second - hand smoke exposure ; now we need to do more to prevent children and young people from taking up smoking by introducing plain packaging for tobacco			0
’ dr @entity113 , chief executive of the @entity114 , said : ' this research is another indication that the smoking ban was a great step towards helping protect children ’s health , as well as making many smokers think more about the harmful effects it has on them			2
' many people think of the ban as just being about smoking in pubs , but this research shows that , with all public places being covered , children have been notable beneficiaries of the legislation			0
' second - hand smoke is still an on - going danger for children , however , and research published since the smoking ban has shown that there are still 300,000 gp visits every year from children as a result of passive smoking			1
' as a society we must keep moving forward in ensuring that we protect our children from passive smoking			2
' the next logical step would be to see a ban on smoking in cars when children are present , as the concentration of smoke caused by smoking within the small enclosed space of a car can be significantly greater than we used to see in pubs before the smoking ban			0
