' @entity0 ' did n't exactly fly for @entity1 on thursday night as just nine million viewers tuned in - less than half of the audience ' @entity3 ' pulled in last year			1
the @entity7 company reported this year 's musical production , starring @entity9 as @entity10 and @entity11 as captain hook , reached 9.1 million viewers			1
in comparison , ' @entity3 ' , which starred @entity14 as @entity15 , reached 18.6 million viewers last year , compelling @entity1 to go back to work getting another musical on the air			1
despite its high ratings , some performances last year were slammed by critics - including @entity23 , who panned for her ' amateur ' acting and @entity26 , as captain @entity27 , who was written off for ' clenched ' singing			1
they missed @entity9 , 26 , enduring a wobbly start to the production as she almost crashed into a wall while attempting to impress @entity42 with his magical flying powers			1
but the actress , who is better known for playing @entity46 in the hit show girls , recovered quickly , cushioning herself against the wall with her hand and shook off the minor mishap			1
the three - hour production also starred @entity11 as a charismatic captain hook - complete with tap - dancing and his inimitable swagger			1
but he was not without his mishaps either , as it appeared he was lip syncing some of the songs , while @entity58 accused the whole cast of taking the fun out of the children 's classic			1
despite the low number of viewers , it appeared to be a hit among many who did tune in , with today anchor @entity69 quipping on friday : ' it was not @entity70			0
@entity72 performance : the 26 - year - old girls star received high praise from viewers on social media for her role as the ' boy who would n't grow up ' in thursday night 's live show on @entity1 we 're hooked : veteran star @entity11 showed off tap - dancing skills with his band of pirates as @entity10 's arch nemesis @entity12 on @entity86 , one viewer , @ joey_aulisio , wrote : ' @entity9 killed it			1
that wooden gator killed it			0
that dog ! great job everyone			0
' another , @ ryansatin , wrote : ' if you 're not watching @entity11 as @entity12 , you are missing out on a truly special moment in tv history			2
' girls co-star @entity100 tweeted : ' @entity9 is about to undertake one of the greatest drag roles in history and we are so proud we could burst			1
' celebrity fans also offered their support			0
@entity107 tweeted : ' i believe in you @entity9 ! ' @entity110 joked : ' @entity111 is crushing this			2
' the @entity114 host - the father of @entity9 - took the night off anchoring duties to watch his daughter 's performance from the wings			1
mr @entity111 told @entity119 : ' we will be watching the broadcast - immediate family only - sequestered in an undisclosed location ... close enough to the production as to burst through the stage door the moment the credits roll			0
' @entity126 , a 22 - year - old woman of @entity128 descent , was plucked from obscurity to play the starring role of native american princess character @entity91 @entity10 with @entity42 and her brothers fly off to @entity133 in the live telecast of the children 's classic however there were grumbles from viewers , as one @entity86 user , @ @entity141 , wrote : ' although @entity9 is singing beautiful , but her @entity143 accent is horrible ! # @entity144 '			1
another fired back : ' chill with the hate people			0
just be thankful its not as awful as @entity14 in @entity149 '			0
@entity150 tweeted : ' @entity11 = @entity151 , no matter what			2
' but she added : ' weird that the ' lost boys ' are grown men			0
' like @entity149 , @entity10 @entity0 ! wisely leaned on @entity156 performers , including five - time @entity158 - nominee @entity157 , who was sadly underused , as mrs @entity42			1
the show also starred @entity160 ( who was in @entity159 ) as @entity91 and a very good @entity161 ( @entity162 ) as @entity42			2
the beefy - armed @entity164 , a @entity158 winner and veteran of last year 's @entity163 , played mr @entity91			2
( in a twist , @entity164 won his @entity158 playing captain hook in the @entity10 play @entity168			1
) @entity42 sings a romantic song expressing her unrequited love for @entity10 in a performance which stayed true to @entity173 's classic novel @entity11 's captain hook character delighted viewers with his drawling dialogue and dancing @entity164 , who also stars in @entity178 , played two characters - the children ’s strict dad mr @entity91 as well as @entity12 ’s right - hand pirate , @entity182 , a character he was far more successful at playing			1
but one of the stand - out performances came from the show ’s second biggest star , @entity186 , despite only being seen onscreen for the last five minutes			0
despite being the first voice we heard as the narrator throughout , @entity186 came out at the very end to play @entity42 after she was all grown up - a mother who was still longing for @entity10 ’s return			2
@entity42 's emotional moment at the end as @entity10 finally returns - and she allows her daughter to follow him to neverland - was one which moved many fans to tears			1
it was also a more culturally sensitive @entity10 , with @entity126 , a 22 - year - old woman of @entity128 descent , portraying the @entity204 princess character @entity91 , and the offensive song @entity205 transformed into @entity206			1
however the biggest reaction went to a rather unexpected cast member - a crazy bright purple - and - blue crocodile , who tormenting captain hook and his pirates throughout			1
