by @entity0 in the battle for supremacy between technology titans @entity5 and @entity4 , the vp of sales for @entity4 's mobile division saw the reaction to the death of @entity11 as the perfect time strike back at @entity5			1
in a document revealed this week as part of the current court battle between @entity5 and @entity4 , @entity16 , head of national sales for @entity4 offered his views as part of an ongoing email chain in 2011			1
@entity4 execs reportedly feared that @entity11 ' death in 2011 could take attention away from the impending launch of its @entity25 now is the time : when @entity11 passed away in 2011 @entity5 fans around the world mourned his loss , but @entity4 , one of the company 's biggest rivals tried to take advantage of the situation attack ! @entity4 executives wanted to come up with a campaign to attack @entity5 's @entity38 just as it was about to launch his holiday @entity41 @entity43 head of sales , @entity16 wrote in an email : ' sorry to continue to push this issue , but i have seen this far too long and i know this is our best opportunity to attack @entity38 ' ' we need to take advantage of this chance , ' wrote @entity53 , then the president and chief executive of @entity55 , according to @entity56			1
mr @entity16 , who was irked by the coverage the @entity38 had received in the wake of @entity11 ' death , replied stating how he wanted to generate some sort of reaction from @entity4			1
in a message dated october 7th , two days after @entity11 passed away : ' unfortunately , @entity11 's [ sic ] passing has led to a huge wave of press coverage of @entity5 's and @entity38 's ' superiority , ' all created by the ' passionate , tireless , perfectionist ... ' the point here is that there is an unintended benefit for @entity5 , since the external messages by 3rd parties are all highlighting and / or supporting the consumer perception that @entity5 products are superior , since @entity11 ' [ sic ] was such a visionary and perfectionist			1
what consumer would n't feel great about purchasing a device developed by such a person			0
' sorry to continue to push this issue , but i have seen this far too long and i know this is our best opportunity to attack @entity38			2
if there is no consensus on the approach i initially proposed , i will stop pushing , but i would like to better understand our strategy so i can align with that , ' he concluded			0
our way of thinking : in a recently released email , a @entity4 executive believed the death of @entity5 co-founder and former ceo @entity11 was the perfect time to attack the @entity38 what a thought : the email , from @entity4 's vice president of sales operations @entity16 , was revealed during the ongoing patent battle between @entity5 and @entity4 at one point , mr @entity16 considered asking @entity106 if they might be able to launch a campaign against @entity5 : ' if it continues to be @entity4 ’s position to avoid attacking @entity5 due to their status as a large customer , can we go to @entity106 and ask them to launch a campaign against @entity5 , based on the many better @entity115 options available in the market for @entity117 [ 2011 ] , ' he wrote			1
@entity16 however appeared not to be sure whether @entity118 ( the latest version of the @entity115 platform ) , which was to be released on october 19 , could face @entity120			0
' seems @entity106 should be asked to carry their own weight in the battle , ' he said			0
' however , we could arrange a co-op arrangement for them if they use [ our ] device prominently in their marketing campaign			0
is @entity118 strong enough to go head to head with @entity120 ? ' the exec concluded his email saying that he believed the campaign was long overdue			2
@entity133 , @entity55 ’s chief marketing officer , then replied that @entity4 will execute the plan			0
' @entity135 , we are going to execute what you are recommending in our holiday [ @entity25 ] campaign , and go head to head with @entity38 , ' he said			2
' we are working on a very aggressive strategy touting our advantages in hardware and software			0
in the process we will demystify the perceived @entity5 advantage ( ecosystem / services ) by showing how consumers can easily switch to @entity115 and have more personalization / more choice by being part of the @entity4 ecosystem			1
more to come soon … best tp , ' @entity133 said			0
dirty tricks : @entity4 called for an attack against the @entity38 just a few days after @entity11 died ready for battle : execs at @entity4 knew that after @entity11 died , there was going to be a lot of positive press for @entity5 and @entity11 which would spill over to the @entity38			1
@entity4 wanted to blunt the impact of all that positive press by pointing out why its phone was better than the @entity38 @entity4 started attacking the @entity38 that winter with their ' @entity165 ' ad campaign in 2012 , which mocked people for standing in line to buy @entity5 products			1
the ads were extremely effective			0
while reviews praised the @entity25 , @entity4 continued to escalate its anti-apple marketing campaign in following years			2
the most effective anti-iphone campaigns followed in 2012 , with @entity4 launching its ' @entity165 ' attack that became viral online			0
an internal email exchange from @entity5 revealed earlier during the trial , showed that @entity5 was quite affected by this particular @entity4 campaign , and even considered changing ad agencies to freshen up @entity38 advertising			1
@entity5 and @entity4 have been waging their latest patent war in a trial that started march 31			1
the two companies have accused each other of copying certain patented features for their own mobile devices			0
@entity16 is one of at least five high - ranking executives from @entity4 's @entity188 mobile business who have left the company or given notice over the past two months			0
neither @entity5 nor @entity4 immediately responded to a request for comment .			2
