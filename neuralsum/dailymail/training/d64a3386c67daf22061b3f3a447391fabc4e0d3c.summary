while the creator says he 's helping users get a spot at in - demand eateries , critics claim the site is ' unethical ' because it makes money off a free service and could damage businesses if bookings are n't sold			1
the service : @entity28 launched the @entity8 website ( pictured ) on july 4 and it currently applies to @entity14 restaurants @entity31 , owner and head chef of @entity35 restaurant @entity33 , said the website is ' disgusting and hurtful to restaurants that already operate on razor thin margins '			1
' an app like that , while not breaking any rules or laws per se , has the potential to be hurtful to small businesses that rely on having a reservation book full of diners that actually show up , ' he said in an email to @entity49			0
' what happens to the reservations that no one winds up buying ? this is a perfect example of tech trying to ' disrupt ' something without thinking of the consequences			0
' i hate this idea			0
' it 's awful and selfish and if it was my restaurant i would check that site everyday to see if my place were listed there so i could delete those reservations			2
' @entity8 creator @entity28 said he developed the website , which applies only to @entity14 restaurants , after waiting 30 minutes for a burrito			1
he said he cancels reservations that are n't purchased four hours in advance and that ' in the interest of ethics and fairness ' , he wants to talk to restaurants about working with them directly			2
@entity76 users have slammed @entity28 as self - interested and ' sleazy '			0
observers have noted the website could make it harder for diners who do n’t want to use @entity8 to get a reservation , and have compared it to apps that allow users to sell street parking			2

' i built this site as an experiment in consumer demand for a particular product , and the jury ’s still out on whether it will work ... , ' the @entity135 history graduate wrote			0
' reservations are n’t free			0
' restaurant tables are limited , in high demand and people wait a good long time as walk - ins to get them			2
' reservations take time and planning to make and the restaurant assumes an opportunity cost from booking them ... backlash : @entity76 users , including @entity148 ( pictured ) , are outraged that startups like @entity8 are capitalizing on services that have always been free backlash : twitter user @entity152 ( pictured ) has labelled startups such as @entity8 ' irresponsible ' and ' sleazy ' backlash : observers and restaurant owners say @entity8 puts businesses in @entity14 at risk if it fails to sell bookings ' what about ethics ? we are talking about an asset that most people do n’t think about having a value			1
... if someone does pay for it willingly , is it really unethical ? ' the consumer has made a choice , the reservation stands , the restaurant gets a table filled as planned , and i have made money for providing the service			0

' selling services that would otherwise be free has becomea trend in the startup world , with several new parking apps allowing users in crowded neighborhoods post when they 're about to leave a spot and charge someone for the opportunity to take it .			0
