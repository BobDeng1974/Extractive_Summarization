by @entity0 @entity2 fully deserves his recall to the @entity5 squad while @entity6 was never going to make it after failing to patch up his differences with coach @entity9 , forward @entity1 said			1
despite some sparkling form for @entity13 champions @entity10 , @entity6 has never been part of @entity16 's plans and was again overlooked when the coach named his provisional 30 - man squad for the tournament in @entity19 on tuesday			1
@entity20 striker @entity1 , who is expected to line up alongside @entity21 and @entity22 in a formidable front line for @entity5 , believed a recall was never going to happen			2
capture the moment : @entity2 is fully deserving of his call - up to the @entity5 @entity28 squad happy to help : the @entity20 defender was given the words of support from @entity1 ' this has been discussed for three years now since the manager was hired for the team and since then we know there was no relationship between them both , ' the 25 - year - old @entity1 said in @entity39 on friday			1
' he did n't call him before so it was n't such a surprise that he was n't called this time as well			0
it would be a very good question for the manager himself to comment , ' he added , trying to avoid the talking point			0
instead , the pony - tailed @entity48 , so frequently mocked by rival @entity50 supporters following some early mistakes upon his arrival at @entity20 at the start of the season , was the surprise inclusion			2
the former @entity59 and @entity60 defender last played for @entity5 in a 1 - 1 home draw against @entity62 in a qualifier in november 2011 but has shown strong form in recent weeks as @entity20 went on to win the @entity50 title on sunday			1
proving people wrong : @entity2 has had major doubters since his move to @entity20 last season while @entity1 is a certain starter for the @entity70 matches against @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 , the 33 - year - old @entity2 will be hoping just to make the slimmed down 23 - man travelling party , although he had support for his cause			2
' it was no surprise that he was called for playing in this @entity28 , i think he has earned his position , ' @entity1 said			0
' he had been criticised , in particular because of the play against @entity21 in the ( @entity83 ) match against @entity84 but it is understandable , he was n't so confident then after starting to play in the @entity87 league			0
' in the last three or four months , he has been playing very well and adapted and i think that is why he was called up and earned his place in the team			0
