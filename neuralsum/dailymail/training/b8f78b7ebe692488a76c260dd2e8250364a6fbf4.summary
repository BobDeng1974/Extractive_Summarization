by @entity0 the brother of 12 - year - old @entity3 victim @entity2 says he has ' compelling new evidence ' and knows where his sibling is buried			1
@entity6 , 56 , claims the evidence has enabled him to narrow down an area the ' size of two football pitches ' on @entity11 , @entity12			1
the body of @entity2 , who was 12 when he was kidnapped and murdered by @entity3 in 1964 , has never been found despite numerous searches			1
new evidence : @entity6 , 56 , claims the evidence has enabled him to narrow down an area the ' size of two football pitches ' on @entity11 , @entity12 tragic : @entity21 's victim @entity2 's body has never been found since his murder in 1964 but mr @entity2 , 56 , said he 'd gathered ' compelling new evidence ' after speaking to @entity24 , the chief prosecution witness in the pair 's murder trial in 1966 , and another source who was close to @entity21			1
he told the @entity29 that photographs of the moor taken by the source ' tied in ' with information provided by @entity24 , who died earlier this year			0
mr @entity2 , who runs a website forum dedicated to finding @entity2 , described the area ' as the width of no more than two football pitches '			1
he added : ' @entity40 and other forum members - of which there are many - are certain than a new official search using this recent evidence could bring @entity2 home			1
' i can not describe what this would mean to my family			0
' @entity2 mother @entity49 , who 'd urged @entity21 to reveal the location of @entity2 's body , died in august , aged 78			1
in september this year mr @entity2 said he was ‘ offended and angered ’ by claims from members of the @entity54 that they may have found killer @entity3 ’s spade on @entity11			1
@entity57 : @entity2 was abducted and murdered by @entity3 , left , and @entity58 , right , in 1964 members of the group claimed to have found it at a spot where they believe @entity2 is buried			1
but @entity2 ’s brother @entity6 said on an internet forum dedicated to finding @entity2 ’s remains : ' this is complete nonsense as is the @entity54 ’s theories and activities			1
' they are to be found all over the internet chasing anybody who they think will listen to them			0
they also post videos claiming to have picked up @entity2 on a ' ghost box ' machine , all of which i find totally disgusting			2
grief : @entity2 's mother @entity3 , pictured on @entity11 above @entity81 , died in august , having never been able to lay her son to rest ' they know my thoughts on their ' findings ' and when they realised , finally , that i could not take them seriously , they got very angry to the point of being abusive			2
' it seems now they , just like the other ' oddballs ' in the news lately , have gone to a newspaper			0
they have seen their moment to jump on the bandwagon with all the recent publicity about the case			0
' this is just another of several spades that have been found on the moor			0
it is not near any real area of interest to anybody but themselves			0
i have spoken about these people with the police and we all agreed their " evidence " was of the sort that did not warrant further consideration - to put it mildly			2
' he added : ' i am and will continue to be offended and angered by these people			0
' it was also claimed earlier this year that @entity21 has passed a letter to his mental health advocate containing details of the burial spot			0
@entity21 is said to have told @entity120 that the letter was only to be opened after his @entity121 launched an investigation and arrested @entity120 on suspicion of preventing the lawful burial of a body			0
but the letter has never been found and detectives believe it may have been a ruse by the killer			0
@entity127 renewed their search to find @entity2 's body in 2003 , including scientists , clinical psychologists , imagery experts , search advisors , geologists , geophysicists , geochemists , archaeologists and anthropologists			1
funeral : mr @entity2 , left , hugs a mourner at his mother @entity49 's funeral after her coffin is carried into @entity144 , in @entity145 , @entity12 in 2009 , it concluded there was no longer any specific information to identify new search areas and therefore the investigation entered , and remains , in a dormant stage			1
@entity152 , head of @entity127 's @entity153 , said : ' as a @entity156 , there is nothing we would have liked more than to draw a close to this dark chapter and of course we are disappointed we have not located @entity2 's remains			2
' however , i would stress that we will never close this case and will always remain open to pursuing any new lines of inquiry that may arise from significant scientific advances or credible and actionable information			1
' ' in the end , only @entity3 knows the whereabouts of @entity2 's body			2
we have always and will continue to hope that one act of humanity on his part will give @entity2 's family some peace			2
' @entity21 and @entity58 were responsible for the murders of five youngsters in the 1960s , sexually torturing their victims before burying their bodies on @entity11			0
they were jailed for life in 1966 for the murders of @entity184 , ten , @entity185 , 12 , and @entity3 , 17			0
they did n't admit to killing @entity2 and another victim @entity187 , 16 , until @entity188 died in prison in 2002 , aged 60			2
torment : many attempts have been made to find the remains of @entity2 on @entity11 , but without success			0

@entity6 , 56 , says he has gathered ' compelling new evidence '
he is certain that new official search using evidence could bring @entity2 home
