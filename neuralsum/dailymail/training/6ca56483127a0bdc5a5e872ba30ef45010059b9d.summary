the @entity1 team are taking no chances with their security even while staying in the luxury @entity4 on man - made @entity5 in @entity7 this week			1
there are 17 security personnel guarding the players even though the hotel in the financial district of @entity7 is already well protected from intruders			1
@entity15 security chief @entity14 had only three assistants among the massive @entity1 party of over 70 who arrived in @entity7 on sunday night			2
checking in : @entity19 and @entity20 arrive at the @entity4 in @entity7 on sunday fully guarded : @entity1 have 17 bodyguards at the @entity4 in @entity7 but they are supported by a six - strong security team from the company who guard @entity25 ; the six have flown to @entity27 purely for their protection role in @entity7			2
in addition , the hotel employs another seven guards to look after the @entity1 party			0
the task force operates in shifts guarding the entrance to the players ’ floors			2
so the chance of @entity7 ’s answer to comedian @entity41 , whom @entity14 bundled away at @entity42 , trying to gatecrash the team rooms is slim indeed			0
@entity44 reacted far better to questions about the spoof @entity47 account @ boringmilner than former @entity51 chief executive @entity50 intended to do about his @entity53 parody @entity47 , @entity54			1
@entity44 amusingly said he wished his foundation @entity47 account had as many followers as the boring one			1
in good spirits : @entity44 was able to joke about his spoof @entity47 account @ boringmilner @entity50 had wanted to tell the media he found @entity54 totally disrespectful until persuaded otherwise by his communications team			1
@entity63 , who is due to make his dramatic t20 return for @entity65 on friday , has given up alcohol for four months			1
@entity63 , renowned as a big boozer from his drunken ashes 2005 celebrations and the 2007 @entity71 pedalo episode , has really cut down his drinking since training to be a boxer			2
sports science advances have pinpointed alcohol as responsible for slowing recovery from soft - tissue injuries			0
taking it seriously : @entity63 quit alcohol four months ago @entity81 is one of the world ’s most popular sportsmen , everywhere it seems apart from @entity7 , where he wants to build a new stadium for his @entity87 franchise			1
not only is there significant opposition from locals but even @entity92 baseball manager @entity91 started swearing this week when asked about @entity81 wanting to bring ‘ soccer ’ to the city			0
hard work : @entity81 coming up against opposition to his plan to build a stadium in @entity7 @entity50 ’s winter base the @entity1 press conferences were held at @entity101 in @entity5 - near the team hotel - whose state - of - the - art gym @entity105 always uses as part of his winter training time in @entity7			2
@entity105 was so engrossed in a work - out there last december that he turned up late for his live interview before he won the 2013 @entity110			0
training camp : @entity105 stays at the @entity113 hotel in @entity7 during the winter this was also the location for the botched award ceremony the year before when @entity117 missed his cue to hand over the third - place trophy to @entity105			0
and another famous tennis player , @entity120 , has been working out at @entity121 this week			0
the @entity1 players settling into their luxury @entity4 will appreciate the facilities and water views			1
but it ’s a 25 - minute taxi ride from @entity7 ’s financial district to the @entity128 party zone			2
and the choice of hotel was connected with keeping players well away from the art deco fleshpots with no plans even for a night out			0
however , music lover @entity134 was delighted to find @entity135 was staying in the @entity1 hotel and the full back had a long chat and a selfie photo with @entity141 frontman			1
music fan : @entity134 took his guitar with him to the @entity71 on tour : @entity135 is staying at the same hotel as the @entity1 squad in @entity7 the second edition of @entity149 ’s video diaries ended abruptly when @entity1 began losing @entity150 last winter			1
@entity151 had to be compensated for the lack of content			0
yet @entity1 sponsors @entity154 have signed up @entity155 for a daily video diary from @entity7			0
however , perhaps fortunately - especially if @entity1 start losing and judging by the content of @entity155 ’s first @entity7 episode - the diary will cease when the team arrive in @entity161 because of @entity163 digital rights .			0

security personnel guarding players at luxury @entity4 in city *'s* financial district
@entity44 laughs off spoof @entity47 account far better than former @entity51 chief executive @entity50
@entity63 has given up alcohol for past four months to make @entity65 comeback possible
