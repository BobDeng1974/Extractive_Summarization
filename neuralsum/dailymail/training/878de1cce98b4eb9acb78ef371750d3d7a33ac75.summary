@entity0 is restoring some of the more traditional ways of doing things and promises that @entity3 will be familiar for users regardless of which version of @entity3 they are now using			1
' @entity3 will deliver the right experience , at the right time			2
' @entity3 will be our most comprehensive platform , ever , ' said mr @entity16			0

@entity0 says its new version of @entity3 will be ' familiar ' and compatible with existing management systems already in use around the world			1
mr @entity16 also announced the launch of the @entity153 , which will allow @entity0 fans and users to get early versions of the new software and become part of the development team by testing @entity3 10 and suggesting improvements			1
industry experts have been having their say on @entity0 's latest operating system , @entity3 10 , which has been announced at an event in @entity165			1
many see the upgrade as being the first steps towards righting the unpopular changes made in the company 's previous desktop software , @entity3 8 , and that is reflected in industry reaction			1
@entity174 , founder of technology website @entity175 said : ' the initial reaction is that @entity0 had introduced some really good features that will appeal to many and fix many of the annoyances of @entity31			1
' it looks like they are doing everything they can to make amends for the mistakes of @entity31 , but with a long lead time and many unanswered questions like release and price , there is still much left to learn			1
' that said it looks to be a good move from the @entity5 based company and one that will benefit many			0
' @entity197 of technology analysts @entity199 also noted the need for @entity0 to regain support after @entity31			1
' @entity3 is the product of a difficult @entity31 launch and a process of refinement based on vocal user feedback			0
@entity0 will hope that this marks a fresh start that will convince developers , enterprise and consumers of its one @entity3 strategy ' , he said			1
' with @entity3 10 @entity0 has re-evaluated its approach to software releases by adopting a web mentality that dovetails with the @entity216 first , mobile first vision under @entity37			1
this open , collaborative approach is critical if @entity0 is to overcome the wave of negative sentiment that has plagued @entity3 8 since launch			1
' the unveiling of @entity3 is notable for its emphasis on enterprise			0
this dialling up of corporate versus consumer functionality is much needed not least because enterprise replacements are driving @entity229 market growth			0
' developers are the lifeblood of any platform so it is critical that @entity0 's ' one @entity3 ' mantra delvers on the promise and re-energises developer engagement			1
' the service will launch tomorrow			0
' we 're inviting our enthusiastic fans to evaluate it with us			0
' we know they 're a vocal bunch			0
' @entity3 10 was confirmed to launch ' later in the year in 2015 '			2
the new software is designed to bring together all of @entity0 's different hardware , such as a the surface tablet ( left ) and the @entity22 ( right ) under the same software			1
across desktop pcs as a whole , only 13.4 % currently run @entity3 8 or @entity250 8.1 , according to research firm @entity251			0
by contrast , it says 51.2 % are powered by @entity253 and 23.9 % by @entity254 , a version that is no longer supported by @entity0			2
for instance , the start menu in @entity3 will appear similar to what 's found in @entity253 , but tiles opening to the side will resemble what 's found in @entity31			0
@entity38 , a @entity0 executive who oversees @entity3 design and evolution , said @entity3 10 will offer ' the familiarity of @entity253 with some of the benefits that exist in @entity31 ' to help business users make the transition			2
@entity38 said that the company was going ' back to basics ' with @entity3 10 , and confirmed that the famous @entity30 menu , which was removed from @entity31 , would be returning			0
' we 're looking to find the balance , so that all the @entity253 users get a familiar experience on the devices they already have , ' he said			0
' it gives the familiarity of @entity253 with some of the elements of @entity31			0
' he said that going from @entity31 to @entity3 is like going from a @entity277 to a @entity278			0
' they do n't have to learn any new way to drive			0
' mr @entity38 also confirmed that @entity3 10 would be compatible with both traditional and touch - based device users like tablets through a new task view with buttons scaled up so that they 're more friendly to those on touchscreen devices			0
users on hybrid devices like the @entity87 tablet will be able to jump between and keyboard and touchscreen modes , with @entity0 demonstrating how the interface will change as you do			1
although the new software wo n't be formally released until next year , analysts already consider its success crucial for @entity0 and new ceo @entity37			1
users can also create multiple desktops to keep things organized the new software represents an attempt to step back from the radical redesign that alienated many @entity229 users when @entity31 was introduced two years ago			2
however , it is not a complete retreat from @entity0 's goal of bridging the gap between pcs and mobile devices : it still has touch - screen functions and strives to create a familiar experience for @entity3 users who switch between desktop computers , tablets and smartphones			1
@entity0 currently has three main systems - @entity31 for traditional computers and tablets , windows phone 8 for cellphones and @entity40 for its gaming console			1
by unifying the underlying systems , software developers will be able to create apps for the various devices more easily			2
consumers will also be able to switch devices more easily and avoid having to buy the same apps multiple times			0
the @entity332 - founded company is pushing to challenge the likes of @entity334 across multiple platforms , but remains the market leader when it comes to desktop computing			2
the company has also launched a @entity340 and @entity3 - powered tablet , the @entity87 , in recent years as they look to challenge the @entity342 and @entity343 , as well as @entity346 's @entity345 platform .			2

@entity0 will show off software for first time on january 21st in @entity350
single app store will hold desktop , phone and tablet apps
claims even thought new software is a radical overhaul , it will be ' familiar '
will launch in fall 2015 - despite initial claims of an earlier release
