by @entity0 published : 10:50 est , 24 september 2012 updated : 02:59 est , 25 september 2012 lied : @entity1 told the little boy 's parents he had been pushed from a fire escape at the @entity6 nursery the owner of a nursery where a child was left critically ill after falling 15 - foot onto concrete from a fire escape lied to his family and said the three - year - old had been pushed			1
@entity14 , now four , had to be put into a coma after suffering a fractured skull when he fell headfirst through a gap in the railings of the staircase at the first - floor nursery in @entity6			1
a court heard the steep staircase was used as an entrance and exit to @entity25 and @entity26 even though the owner knew the fire escape was unsafe , as small children could easily slip through large gaps on either side of the steps			1
@entity6 @entity32 was told that @entity1 had lied to @entity14 's family and to @entity34 about the fall and created a ' fiction ' surrounding it , claiming that the three - year - old was pushed off the steps during a fire drill at the nursery in @entity41			1
@entity1 - who has been ordered to pay out over £ 20,000 - even tried to persuade other members of staff to back up his story as part of his ' utterly cynical ' cover - up after @entity14 plunged headfirst from the top of the fire escape in march last year			1
recorder @entity48 said it was only thanks to ' pure luck ' that a similar accident had not happened before at the nursery			0
' it was , in a hackneyed but accurate phrase , an accident waiting to happen , ' he said			0
' the fact it had not happened before is , in my judgement , pure luck			0
' you tried to persuade two members of staff to uphold this fiction but they have always refused to do so , ' he added			0
the court was told how @entity1 fed his story to @entity14 's distraught mother while she was at the hospital with her critically ill son			1
' mr @entity1 ’s conduct on behalf of the company was as bad as his conduct exposing children to this risk in the first place , ' the judge said			2
critical : @entity14 suffered a fractured skull following the fall at the @entity25 nursery in @entity41 , @entity6 injuries : the swelling on @entity14 's head is clear in this photograph ' you do n't expect to see your child in that condition , especially when they are left at a nursery , a place you trust to keep them safe , ' she said			1
' unsafe ' : @entity93 panels have now been added to the railings on either side of the fire escape leading from the first - floor nursery fined : @entity25 owner @entity1 was ordered to pay out more than £ 20,000 at @entity6 @entity32 @entity99 owner @entity1 admitted one count of breaching his duty as an employer , as well as failing to notify the authorities - in this case @entity105 - within ten days of the incident in march last year			1
the judge fined the nursery £ 16,000 and ordered it to pay costs of £ 7,500 and a £ 15 victim surcharge			2
but @entity14 's mother said she was disappointed by the verdict , and insisted that @entity1 should not be allowed to care for children			1
' doctors have told us the effects of the fall might not show until @entity14 reaches puberty as it could have damaged his pituitary gland at the base of his brain , ' she said			0
' i am disappointed by the verdict in this case and would say this man and his nursery should not be allowed to care for children			0
' prosecutor @entity127 described @entity1 ’s attempt to cover up the incident as ‘ utterly cynical ’			2
' what we have here is a cover up of how the incident occurred and that is an obstruction of the authorities , ' he said			0
' why was he covering it up ? because he recognised the serious nature of the offence			0
' @entity141 , defending , apologised to @entity14 on behalf of the company for the injuries he sustained			0
he said the nursery - owner wrongly believed the fire escape was safe to use following both a fire safety inspection and an @entity34 inspection			2
on the mend : @entity150 with her son @entity14 , now four ( front ) , and his brother @entity149 , nine			0

@entity14 fractured his skull after falling 15ft onto concrete from fire escape outside nursery *building*
nursery owner @entity1 allowed steep staircase to be used despite knowing it was unsafe for children , court was told
owner then lied to three - year - old 's parents in an ' utterly cynical ' cover - up
@entity168 in @entity6 ordered to pay out more than £ 20,000
