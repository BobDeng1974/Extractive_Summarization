' i needed someone that night to tell me to stop playing and bring me to my senses , ' the multi-millionaire told the court			2
' if i had been told to stop , of course i would stop immediately			0
no one ever told me to stop or think about my gambling			0
' mrs @entity38 , who is married to @entity8 foreign minister , @entity40 , had already suffered substantial losses at other casinos when she arrived at @entity3 on the evening of april 3 , the court heard			1
despite allegedly telling staff she did not want to play , just a few hours later she had reached her £ 1.7m cheque - cashing limit and soon afterwards , she was £ 2million down			1
barrister @entity46 told judge @entity47 that mrs @entity38 had made it clear when she arrived that she was ' a gambling addict ' and did not want to play punto banco			1
' the staff paid no regard to her distraught demeanour or what she told them and did nothing to discourage her from gambling or to reflect on the wisdom of further gambling , ' he said			0
' she commenced gambling and , as her losses mounted , staff encouraged her to continue , saying she was going to win and that her facility would be increased to £ 2million			1
' as her gambling continued , staff stood behind her with pre-written cheques which were provided to her until £ 2million was gambled and lost			2
exclusive : mrs @entity38 , the wife of the @entity8 foreign minister , blew her millions at the @entity14 club 's ( above ) punto banco table in just a few hours in april 2012			1

' he added : ' @entity80 failed to take any or any reasonable measures to prevent or mitigate the consequences or aggravation of self - inflicted harm by the assumption of control over her			0
' giving evidence , mrs @entity38 said encouragement had been the ' last thing she needed ' that night			2
mrs @entity38 is married to @entity8 foreign minister , @entity40 , pictured above ' if they had not given me more facilities that night , i would have had to stop playing , ' she told the court			1
' when i began to run out of chips that night and asked for more money , they said i had finished my facility			0
' i asked for more money and they said " yes "			0
i continued to play from the same book and with the same dealer			0
they should have discouraged me , but instead they took advantage of me			0
arrival : the multi-millionaire ( pictured arriving at court ) says staff stood behind her at the table , encouraging her to keep playing the card game			2
this despite them allegedly having been made aware of her addiction ' had it not been for all of the above actions of @entity3 and its employees , i believe that there was a real chance i would not have gambled at @entity3 on the night in question when i lost the £ 2million , or i would have stopped gambling before i lost the £ 2million			1
' @entity124 is the sister game of @entity127 , the high - stakes card game favoured by @entity129			0
it is a game of chance that involves no skill or strategy , with each player 's moves forced by the cards they are dealt			0
the aim is to hold cards with a count of nine or closest to nine			0
you bet that either the hand held by the player ( punto ) or banker ( banco ) will win and place bets on the appropriate area on the table			2
you can also make a ‘ tie ’ bet			0
tens and picture cards and multiples of ten count as zero : for example , 7 + 3 = 0 ; 10 + 4 = 4 ; king + 10 = 0			0
the game 's appeal rests on how the advantage can switch with each new card , lending huge excitement to the action			2
the case reached the @entity20 after @entity3 sued mrs @entity38 for £ 1million , claiming that some of the cheques she had handed over that night were not honoured			1
but mrs @entity38 told the court the casino 's claim should fail because it had wrongly allowed her to gamble on credit , which is illegal			2
she said she had handed over cheques , which were only cashed if she lost , meaning she should be reimbursed with the £ 1million she eventually paid out			0
however , the casino denies mrs @entity38 's accusations and insists that she was not put under any pressure to place her bets			2
@entity177 , defending the club , pointed out that , nine months after she lost the money , mrs @entity38 had honoured £ 1million of the debt without complaint			2
meanwhile , @entity3 ceo , @entity181 , told the court that it is not unusual for a high - stakes gambler to have their cheque - cashing facility increased			1
he added that it was not until months later that the casino had realised that the cheques had not been honoured			0
' she was a very good customer for us , ' he said			0
' there had been a very good history of paying			0
there was no thought in our mind that the cheques were not going to get paid			0
' during her frequent trips to @entity14 , mrs @entity38 has been a regular in the capital 's casinos , often spending hundreds of thousands , and even millions , of pounds in one evening , the court heard			1
court : mrs @entity38 first realised she was a gambling addict in 1999 , @entity14 's @entity20 ( pictured ) heard between 1999 and april 2012 , @entity3 alone had received more than £ 20million in buy - ins from mrs @entity38 , of which she had lost more than £ 7million			1
mrs @entity38 told the court that she had first realised she was a gambling addict in 1999			1
