by @entity0 and @entity1 women carrying devastating inherited conditions yesterday backed the government ’s approval of dna treatment to create babies with three genetic parents – a technique that could let them have healthy children			1
ministers say they will publish draft regulations for @entity13 to become the first country legalising the controversial @entity16 procedure , although it will be up to mps to vote them in			1
the move has sparked an ethical debate , with desperate women who could benefit calling for an urgent change in the law			2
@entity27 's son @entity26 died last week at the age of 21 , after battling the rare hereditary condition @entity30 since the age of four ( pictured aged one with his mother ) however , some groups fear the technology could lead to designer babies			1
but @entity40 , who has lost seven children , said : ‘ we are not changing the colour of eyes and we are not choosing to have boys and girls , we just want a baby to be healthy and survive , that ’s all			1
’ @entity46 , who risks giving any future children @entity49 disease , which affects the brain , nervous system and muscles , said : ‘ to have the option of knowing that your child could live a life free of these devastating diseases and live without this cruel life is something incredible			2
’ the technique involves replacing defective @entity61 in the mother ’s egg with material from a donor egg			1
the resulting healthy child would therefore have genetic material from three parents – two mothers and a father			1
for the first time the so - called ‘ germ line ’ of inherited dna from the mother would be altered which , critics say , would mark a turning point in the ethics of reproductive technology			2
@entity27 ( pictured with son @entity79 ) has lost seven children and believes that the procedure would help babies survive professor dame @entity82 , the government ’s chief medical officer , said the ban on tinkering with the fundamental dna that determines an person ’s make - up , such as facial features and eye colour , will not change			1
but taking a snippet of @entity61 during the proposed process was more like replacing a defective ‘ battery pack ’ in human cells , she said			1
@entity46 said that the option to know your children could survive would be priceless it would affect a tiny amount of dna in mitochondria – the tiny powerhouses inside cells that turn food into energy – which is only passed down by the mother			1
mothers with certain defective dna can pass on mitochondrial diseases			2
if mps approve the regulations , the first patients could be assessed and approved for treatment in 2015			1
it is expected that up to ten healthy babies with three parents each could be born every year to couples who might otherwise face the heartbreak of seeing them severely disabled and dying young			1
sir @entity116 , president of the @entity117 , said : ‘ @entity118 is delighted that the @entity119 is taking steps to ensure techniques which could reduce the number of children born with rare mitochondrial diseases can move closer to being used in the clinic			2
’ @entity126 , chief of the @entity127 , said : ‘ mitochondrial diseases are some of the most debilitating inherited conditions , for which there are few therapies and no cures			0
‘ acknowledging the need for treatments to be proven safe and effective and for the public to feel comfortable with the implications is important , but that caution must not prevent us taking bold steps in the adoption of such potentially life - saving advances			0
’ but @entity141 , of the @entity142 in @entity143 , said the procedure would deliberately create an embryo for ‘ spare parts ’ , adding : ‘ parenthood is about unconditional welcome of children , not manufacture and control			2
couples who do not want to take the risk of passing on mitochondrial disease might want to consider ethical alternatives like adoption			0
’ dr @entity156 , director of @entity157 , said : ‘ it is a disaster that the decision to cross the line that will eventually lead to a eugenic designer baby market should be taken on the basis of a biased and inadequate consultation			0
’ the experience of losing seven children left @entity40 devastated			1
@entity166 died within four days of being born after suffering from diseases caused by defects in her mitochondrial dna			0
mrs @entity40 , 46 , from @entity171 , and her husband @entity172 believe the new preventative technology is ‘ the best way forward ’			1
she believes it ‘ would have made a huge difference ’ to her life and helped with her desperate hope for a healthy child			0
she said : ‘ it ’s quite hard to keep going and trying , but i had to			0
’ when her son @entity79 survived his first week , she dared to hope things would be better			0
but at four and half he was diagnosed with @entity184 ’s disease , a result of mutations within mitochondrial dna that affect the brain and nervous system			0
@entity79 confounded doctors ’ predictions that he would live only a few months and reached his 21st birthday before dying			0
mrs @entity40 said : ‘ @entity79 was my life			1
you live with that pain every day			0
’ for @entity46 , the risk of passing on defective dna and the possibility of having severely disabled children is a real fear			2
miss @entity46 , 24 , is having tests to see if she has @entity49 disease , caused defective mitochondrial dna			0
her mother is a carrier and it led to the death of her maternal aunt			0
miss @entity46 , from @entity208 , said : ‘ this is not about eugenics			0
we are talking about preventing life - threatening diseases			0

ministers say they will publish draft regulations to legalise the technique
the @entity61 treatment creates babies with three genetic parents
@entity40 , who has lost seven children , said that *campaigners* just want to help babies to survive
