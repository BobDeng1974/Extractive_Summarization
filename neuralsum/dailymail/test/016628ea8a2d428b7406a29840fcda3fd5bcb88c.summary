fleece jackets , piles of hay , a fuzzy stuffed animal sloth and a lot of fruit were on @entity7 's shopping list when she became a surrogate mother to a big - eyed , spikey - haired little boy			1
a handful of animal keepers at @entity13 's @entity12 found themselves with a tiny red - headed charge when @entity16 , a @entity18 orangutan , died a few weeks after giving birth			1
now 5 months old , the 14 - inch , 11 - pound @entity20 is starting to crawl			1
about 9,000 people visited the zoo saturday , said @entity36 , the zoo 's community relations coordinator			2
' it was such a larger day ( for attendance ) than we usually have in april , ' she said			0
@entity41 is one of several primate handlers who provided round - the - clock care for the infant , improvising along the way			2
' we lived like an orangutan , ' @entity41 said			0
' orphan : tuah 's parents @entity16 and @entity50 , both passed away last fall just a few weeks after tuah 's birth orangutans spend most of their time in trees			1
a baby orangutan instinctively clings to his mother 's fur while she builds nests and scavenges for food			2
so tuah could n't be swaddled and put in a crib like a human baby ; he needed to hang onto someone , even while sleeping			0
a zoo employee used specialized sewing machines and old fleece jackets to make a vest with strips that simulate an orangutan 's fur			2
the animal keepers took turns wearing the vest and crawling in hay , while tuah held tight to their chests , developing his muscle strength			0
but @entity20 ca n't cling to humans forever			1
that 's where his sister , @entity81 , comes in			1
after tuah 's birth , zookeepers began training @entity84 on maternal duties			1
@entity84 will turn 10 next month and is an eager - to - please orangutan that enjoys learning , @entity41 said			2
' gorillas are a whole other different story , but orangutans are very easy , ' said @entity41 with a laugh			0
she called the species ' insanely intelligent			0
' taken care of : after four months of round - the - clock care from zookeepers and his older sister , an orphaned orangutan baby is ready to meet the public the first step was to teach @entity84 to be gentle with the infant			1
' she was young and spunky , so that was our biggest worry , that she would n't know what was too rough , ' said @entity41			0
they plied @entity84 with rewards			0
the more complicated the task , the higher - value the treat : from the everyday fruit to her favorite grapes and pomegranates to the foods she only gets on special occasions , like jello , granola , graham crackers , applesauce and peanuts			0
when @entity84 had mastered being gentle , zookeepers gave her a stuffed animal to teach her how to pick the baby up , hold it and flip it over			0
the two were introduced when @entity20 was 3 months old , and for the last month , they have lived together full time , @entity41 said			2
@entity84 has adjusted to child - rearing and will retrieve tuah for animal keepers and carry him between exhibits			2
she also helps tuah navigate the ropes and stops him from tripping on toys			0
on saturday , tuah spent a lot of time holding onto the ropes and occasionally wandered up to the glass , giving visitors outside the enclosure an up close glance			0
' he stayed awake and fought off his nap until about 3:30 , ' @entity36 said			0
@entity20 's father was @entity147 , an orangutan who became famous for correctly predicting the @entity149 winner seven years in a row			1
@entity147 died of cancer in september , but officials hope @entity20 inherited his ability			1
' tuah 's going to try it next year , ' @entity41 said			1
lost her parents : @entity20 's father , now dead , gained national fame by correctly picking the @entity149 winner seven straight years is ready to meet the public			1

now 5 months old , the 14 - inch , 11 - pound @entity20 is starting to crawl
tuah was revealed to the public on saturday at @entity13 's @entity12
@entity20 's parents died *shortly* after she was born
@entity20 's father was @entity147 , an orangutan who became famous for correctly predicting the @entity149 winner seven years in a row
once she is ready , tuah 's sister @entity81 will care for her instead of humans
