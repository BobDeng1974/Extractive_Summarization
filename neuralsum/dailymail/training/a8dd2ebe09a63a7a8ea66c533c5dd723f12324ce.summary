problem : mr @entity8 said he had been concerned about the sanitation of the company 's distribution centers claiming they had consistently attracted a high number of rats due to available food waste ' the distribution centres and stores are teaming with vermin and it is the only place i have ever come in to contact with rat urine so there is no where else i could have got the disease , ' he claimed			1

' the equipment @entity2 give us is simply not sufficient , all we have are the overalls and a pair of cloth gloves that soak in all the moisture			2
