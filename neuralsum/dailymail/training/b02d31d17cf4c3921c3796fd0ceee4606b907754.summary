by @entity0 published : 14:44 est , 16 november 2012 updated : 16:47 est , 16 november 2012 thrill seeker : @entity2 poses in his cluster balloon craft before he took it out for a test run in @entity6 an adrenaline junkie soared through the air in a boat attached to hundreds of balloons today as part of a test flight for an ambitious attempt to cross the @entity14			1
@entity2 was cheered on by crowds this at the @entity17 , in @entity6 , as he tested out his new equipment with an early morning flight			1
cramped in a seven foot boat the intrepid adventurer carried out the dry run as he prepares to fulfill his dream of crossing the @entity14 next year			1
accompanied by his co-pilot @entity24 , the adventurer will now fly across @entity6 for 11 hours in the dry run			2
a bystander said : ' everyone stood right next to it holding him down			0
then they said launch and he let the ballast go and off he went - there was no stopping him			0
it went off like a rocket , it was amazing how quickly he lifted off			0
' @entity2 , who had worked through the night with 20 helpers filling the balloons with helium , soared above the crowd and drifted perfectly towards a nearby lake to test the emergency landing procedure			1
the ‘ shake - out ’ test - which will give the team vital information about its capabilities - also included a landing and relaunch manoeuvre on a near by lake , to see if it was able to land safely on water			2
the 38 - year - old then cut away a sand bag weighing the boat down			2
having checked the landings were in order he then ascended into the cloudless sky and tested the boat ’s built - in satellite communication equipment			0
it is not the first time @entity2 has taken to the sky powered solely by balloons , as he first wowed the world in may 2010 when he flew from @entity80 to @entity81 dangling from helium balloons - just like the @entity84 ’ character @entity83			1
teamwork : unlike his last balloon adventure @entity2 will this time be doing it alongside co-pilot @entity24 dream : @entity2 hopes to make it across the @entity14 in his seven boat next year safe landing : @entity2 and co-pilot @entity24 make sure the boat can land efficiently - done so by cutting away at some of the balloons now the daredevil plans to take his ambition a little further with an incredible world - first attempt from @entity100 , @entity101 , to @entity102 , @entity103 in the boat			1
daredevil : he is planning an incredible world - first attempt from @entity100 , @entity101 , to @entity102 , @entity103 , carried by cluster balloons in his little yellow rowing boat @entity2 , backed by a team of four scientists , has been brainstorming potentially life - threatening scenarios he will encounter , and testing them			1
' i always joke and say we are doing this with wind , helium , hope - and testing , ' he said			0
' i do n’t want to be a thousand miles off the coast and find a critical problem that i could have found had i tested better previously			0
' he added : ' what happens if there is unforecast weather or if i ’m at high altitude and i become confused on the lines			0
which lines do i cut ? ' so we have colour - coded them , we labeled them			0
that is a simple scenario of what things we are testing			0
' depending on funding , @entity2 plans to cross the @entity14 next year where he is expected to travel between 2,500 to 3,500miles over three to six days			1
he will float at between 18,000ft - 25,000ft and will net a world record for the highest cluster balloon flight when he climbs above a previous record of 21,600ft			0
he ’ll take oxygen through tubes feeding into his nose between 12,000 and 18,000ft and up to 25,000ft he ’ll wear a full oxygen mask			0
@entity2 will control his altitude by popping individual balloons with a knife to lose height			2
an @entity147 exposure suit will protect him from harsh elements like blistering uv rays from the sun and biting coldness			0
should the adventure fail , @entity2 has already said he will change to a cold water immersion suit that will preserve him if he ditches into the freezing north @entity14			1
the forest of balloons need to lift the craft for @entity2 's test run in @entity6 mapping it out : the thrill seeker and his team of helpers plan their pilot journey in the early hours of this morning ' i ’ll be miles away from any from of rescue and will have to survive at sea			1
' the boat also gives me something sturdy and lightweight to ride while up in the air , so it ’s the logical choice			0
' in history there have been only 29 attempts at ballooning the @entity14 , with five deaths and only eight successful crossings			2
@entity2 has harnessed the huge public interest in his previous adventures , to launch a $ 300,000 appeal to crowd - fund online the expensive helium and special uv resistant balloons he will need for his record - breaking flight			1
those interested in donating or sponsoring @entity2 can do so at : @entity183 helium canisters are laid out as they prepare to blow up the many balloons needed			1
equipment is not cheap and @entity2 is desperately trying to raise funds for the adventure hardwork : a team of helpers are needed to help blow up each of the many balloons needed for his preparation			2

@entity2 carries out test flight in @entity6 in seven foot yellow rowing boat
he hopes he is now prepared to make it across the @entity14 with the aid of just *360* helium filled balloons
