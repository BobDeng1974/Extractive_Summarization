by @entity0 published : 19:14 est , 8 november 2013 updated : 19:14 est , 8 november 2013 this is a problem familiar to every professional party - giver			2
after a night of @entity4 revelries to rival the last days of @entity5 , the exact details of the previous evening ’s events can seem a bit hazy in the cold light of day			0
this seems to have happened to multi-millionaire pr guru @entity11			1
after throwing a lavish bash last weekend at his vast @entity15 home to celebrate his 50th birthday , it appeared to slip his mind that one of the guests was prime minister @entity22			1
party host @entity11 , pictured with his wife @entity23 , is a formidable networker			1
he once threw a @entity25 in the face of an editor who criticised his wife , and smeared chocolate cake on @entity31 's shirt such a lapse of memory would suggest that even by the impressive standards of @entity11 ’s previous extravagant soirees , this was quite some knees - up			1
but it is not every day that one ’s champagne - drinking guests are entertained by rock stars @entity41 and @entity42 with a rendition of @entity44 hit @entity45			2
@entity46 frontman @entity41 also led the celebrity - packed throng in a rendition of @entity49 , while @entity51 ’s former henchman - in - chief @entity50 apparently played the bagpipes			2
@entity22 and @entity53 were at the bash - but it seems their host momentarily forgot it goes without saying that @entity11 and his wife @entity23 ( daughter of media mogul @entity60 ) have a wide circle of friends			1
a trio of chefs — @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 — were among the guests , alongside @entity69 , @entity70 and outdoor adventurer @entity71			0
also there were @entity51 and @entity73 , who are said to have ‘ tripped the light fantastic ’ on the dance floor all night , and the model @entity76			0
mrs @entity73 , who likes a good sing - song , was reported to have performed a duet with @entity80 rocker @entity41			2
one guest told me that the @entity83 hired a professional tattoo artist for the night to give guests free body art. but the @entity88 ’s wife @entity87 , who already has a dolphin tattoo on her ankle , did not take up the offer			1
it was , of course , a family celebration — as any 50th birthday party should be			1
one of @entity11 ’s teenage children sang a @entity96 song , while her siblings showed a fun - poking film of their father			1
according to one guest , @entity11 gave an ‘ unusually humble speech in which he thanked everyone for putting up with him ’			1
the @entity105 - themed bash took place at @entity107 , a 22 - bedroom , @entity110 - listed @entity109 pile , set in 20 acres of @entity112 countryside , which @entity11 and miss @entity23 bought for £ 6 million in 2008 and have spent a fortune doing up			1
the rambling nature of the house may be the reason why @entity11 momentarily forgot that mr @entity22 — who , like his hosts , is a member of the so - called @entity118 set and has a house nearby — was at the party			1
when one broadsheet diary columnist asked @entity11 if the pm had attended , the pr man reportedly replied : ‘ no. please let me know if you would like more explicit clarification			1
’ @entity73 , right , wife of former pm @entity51 , was said to have performed a duet with @entity46 frontman @entity41 , left			0
the @entity80 rocker also sang happy birthday while mr @entity51 's former spin doctor @entity50 played the bagpipes however , the following day an associate clarified not only that mr @entity22 had , in fact , been there , but that chancellor @entity132 was , too			0
the confusion led the veteran political commentator @entity134 to tweet mischievously : ‘ @entity11 “ forgets ” @entity22 was at his 50th			1
’ so why all the intrigue ? part of the sensitivity is the fact that some people have questioned the judgment of the prime minister and mr @entity132 in attending the home of @entity147 ’s daughter at a time when key executives of his newspaper empire are on trial at the @entity153 for phone - hacking			1
a friend of mr @entity22 — himself a former tv pr man , of course — defended his decision to attend , insisting : ‘ @entity22 is an old friend of @entity11			1
he ’s known him for donkey ’s years and @entity22 ’s incredibly loyal			0
it was his friend ’s party , so he naturally he felt he should go			0
’ and who could resist the lure of an invitation to one of the @entity83 ’ hot ‑ ticket events ? the guests included a trio of celebrity chefs - from left , @entity66 , @entity65 and @entity67 the couple ’s joint fortune is in excess of £ 250 million , with @entity176 representing global brands such as @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 and @entity181			0
a previous party took place two years ago when guests included a @entity185 of the political and celebrity worlds , including @entity190 politicians @entity188 and @entity191 and broadcasters @entity192 , @entity194 and @entity195			0
on that occasion , there was a room with a sommelier serving giant bottles of vintage claret			0
one guest told me : ‘ @entity11 is like a @entity205 figure , collecting people and things			1
’ in these straitened , we ’re - all - in - this - together times , politicians might think twice before accepting an invitation to such a grandiloquent event			0
but few can resist the temptation to gawp at the opulence of @entity11 ’s rural retreat			1
' the plutocrat ’s house contains a restored 17th - century chapel , alongside two pools — one with a horse ’s head sculpture — a gym and a vast wine cellar			0
writer and socialite @entity70 , who has dated @entity31 and @entity224 , had one of the lucky invites in the garage , @entity11 keeps a 1963 white @entity229 convertible that he encourages guests to drive around the grounds			2
@entity11 himself claims to have reached a top speed of 140mph			2
he is a voracious collector , and his office in the @entity112 house is decorated with historical documents , including the @entity237 — the 1936 letter from @entity239 relinquishing the throne in order to marry @entity242			0
one visitor to the family ’s @entity245 home says a painting by the @entity250 - @entity249 artist @entity248 hangs in the hallway			0
for his birthday last week , his wife is said to have bought him a present that might not be to everyone ’s taste : a painting called p * * * ing at @entity259 , by 17th - century @entity261 artist @entity260			2
it depicts a man in a coat urinating into a moonlit lake			0
networker mr @entity11 took the ' survival of the fittest ' theory literally - by inviting tv adventurer @entity71 such quirky humour does not come cheap : the last time the picture was offered at auction , in 2010 , it sold for more than £ 361,000			1
@entity11 ’s taste in food is similarly extravagant			2
one recent lunch guest recalls their host , a keen cook , rustling up filet mignon , fettuccine with crab , leeks sautéed in crème fraîche , sautéed sausages in pastry , curried - chicken salad , roast potatoes and broccoli , all washed down with claret ( a @entity289 )			0
such attention to detail has helped @entity11 to become a formidable networker			2
the great - grandson of @entity296 , @entity11 ’s father was the @entity298 mp - turned - broadcaster sir @entity297 , his sister @entity293 is a broadcaster and wife of film director @entity300 , and his uncle was the renowned painter @entity301			1
he and miss @entity23 , who have six children from three marriages , met in 1997			2
their marriage , in 2001 , was a lavish affair at @entity307			0
they have since had two children together			0
the pugnacious @entity11 is a formidable figure in the business world			2
once , he threw a @entity25 in the face of an editor who criticised his wife , and smeared chocolate cake on the shirt of the actor @entity31 ( a former client ) during a row at a @entity245 nightclub three years ago			0
@entity31 allegedly responded by punching him in the face			0
there may not have been any such unpleasantries last weekend at @entity11 ’s 50th birthday party			1
indeed , it seems to have been such a convivial night that there was confusion about whether the prime minister had dropped in and joined the festivities .			0

star - *studded* 50th birthday bash held by ' @entity205 - like ' @entity11
@entity334 guru is married to @entity23 , daughter of media mogul @entity60
but when asked by one columnist if @entity88 attended , he reportedly said ' no '
