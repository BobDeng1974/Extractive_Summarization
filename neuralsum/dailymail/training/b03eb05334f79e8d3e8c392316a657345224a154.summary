by @entity0 published : 05:28 est , 21 january 2013 updated : 17:37 est , 21 january 2013 vice president @entity1 made quite an entrance when his motorcade pulled up to @entity4 on monday morning , sporting some @entity6 - style aviators even though the sun had not fully risen			1
he was accompanied by his wife dr @entity9 , who wore a stunning grey silk dress , and several members of his family			1
though he appeared cool and collected on monday morning , vice president @entity1 made his latest gaffe just last night as he told supporters that he was ' proud to be the @entity16 '			1
four years after making history by becoming the first @entity48 - @entity47 president , @entity37 was due today to kick off his second term with a scaled - back inauguration to reflect the tempered expectations for his next four years in office			1
demure : dr @entity9 wore a grey jacket and matching dress all smiles : @entity1 and @entity56 appear very happy as they greet @entity58 at the church the full look : during their walk after the formal ceremony , viewers were able to glimpse at dr @entity9 's look prepped : she wore her blonde hair loose and dangling pearl earrings but @entity1 's gaffe on saturday could be a premonition for 2016 as he has n't ruled out the possibility that he will run for office after president @entity37 finishes his second term			1
even though he will be just a few days short of his 74th birthday on the next election day , @entity1 has hinted he is considering a run for president			2
because @entity42 is an early battleground in the state - by - state primaries which determine the political parties ' candidates for president , any big event thrown by state officials this weekend was likely to draw at least one or two potential contenders for the @entity86 in 2016			0
following the slip - up , @entity1 , corrected himself , and returned to a favorite line from this fall 's campaign			2
patterned : during the luncheon @entity92 's dress was fully on view , and unlike mrs @entity37 who normally shows her toned arms with sleeveless dresses , mrs @entity9 was the one to opt for a cooler cut this time around sharing a laugh : mrs @entity9 and mr @entity37 had a giggle when they attended the luncheon in @entity102 ' i 'm proud to be vice president of the @entity47 , ' he said , ' but i am prouder to be @entity37 's , president @entity37 's , vice president			1
' @entity1 's unannounced appearance at the ' @entity106 in the @entity108 ' ball in @entity109 was not too surprising			0
aside from any of his own personal political aspirations , the state was also key to the @entity37 - @entity1 team 's victory over republicans @entity114 and @entity115 in the november 6 election			1
looking away but at each other : mr @entity1 ran up to many of the waving crowds and shook a few hands but mrs @entity9 stayed pretty much on course and waved to admirers @entity1 went on to say he had dropped by to thank @entity123 for supporting the @entity125 ticket in the election			2
' i came to say thank you , ' @entity1 told those gathered at the @entity130 , a short walk from the @entity86			0
' just simply thank you			0
' showing appreciation to @entity42 , an industrial and farm state that is home to 3 million people , is an expected courtesy in national politics because of the state 's role in separating contenders from pretenders in each presidential race			0
vice president @entity1 takes the oath of office during the 57th presidential inauguration official swearing - in ceremony at the @entity150 in @entity109 on sunday vice president @entity1 has hinted he could intend to run for president in 2016 , when president @entity37 's second term will come to an end in early 2008 , the results in the @entity42 caucuses convinced many democrats that @entity37 could win the @entity125 nomination over former first lady @entity157 , now @entity37 's secretary of state			1
next to @entity159 , @entity1 is widely seen one of the two top contenders for the @entity125 in the next election cycle			0
also in the crowd at the @entity42 party was @entity166 's @entity125 governor , @entity165			0
mr @entity165 was a frequent surrogate for @entity37 in 2012 and is also seen by many @entity125 as a potential presidential possibility - meaning he could be spending a lot of time with @entity123 during the next three years			2
