mammal - like robots with whiskered touch systems , machines powered by slime and dancing humanoids that can communicate with humans are just a few of the robots invading the @entity8 today			1
the @entity10 conference showcases a wide array of strange machines that not only advance robotics but help scientists understand more about nature ’s living organisms by trying to replicate their functions			1
led by the @entity19 , the event unites technologists from around the globe to explore the future of biomimetic and biohybrid technologies with a focus on future life - like robots			2
the @entity33 anthropomorphic hand has twenty degrees of freedom , force sensors and ultra sensitive touch sensors on the fingertips cutting edge machines in the spotlight include robots that move and sense like animals , biohybrid exhibits that mix biological and artificial parts , including an emotionally - expressive robot controlled by slime mould and the latest biomimetic medical devices that draw their inspiration from the natural world			1
the conference is concerned with the development of future technologies using the principles underlying living systems and the flow of communication signals between living and artificial systems			1
professor @entity60 from the @entity19 ’s @entity61 said : ' these technologies will have a profound effect on many different aspects of our future lives , posing important ethical questions and practical concerns that this event gives us chance to address			0
' scientists at the @entity73 and @entity74 for robotics are showcasing their @entity77 sensor - a group of artificial whiskers modeled on the sensitive hairs on mice			1
each artificial whisker can be moved to explore objects , while a sensor gives a perception of touch many of the robots seek to replicate nature 's sense of touch			1

the technology is based based upon our understanding of how the epidermal layers of the fingertip are deformed during touch the technology is based based upon scientists ' understanding of how the epidermal layers of the fingertip are deformed during touch as is demonstrated on a humanoid robot hand			1
scientists are also excited by the prospect of combining the natural with the artificial			1
biological and artificial sciences are converging as technologists realise that natural and engineered systems share common principles			1
slime mould is used in an installation that includes a robotic head emoting the responses of the mould to external stimuli and a demonstration of the learning abilities of the mould in robot tasks scientists believe the possibility of creating biohybrid machines that combine biological and artificial parts will radically change our technology and blur the boundary between the natural and the artificial			1
in the future we may also find ourselves becoming more ' biohybrid , ' as we become more intimately linked to the machines that serve us			2
one example of a biohybrid machine on display at the exhibition uses ' slime mould ' - the largest single cell visible to the human eye that lives in woods digesting dead leaf and tree material but is also capable of simple learning and memory			2
a quadruped robot mammal called @entity171 by @entity172 is on display that is the most advanced in the world			2
it weights approximately 70 kilogrammes and is around the size of a large dog the mould is used in an installation that includes a robotic head emoting the responses of the slime mould to external stimuli , and a demonstration of the learning abilities of the mould in robot tasks			0
the exhibition also includes a ' living wearable ' made from colour - changing cells , inspired by the skin of a chameleon that changes colour to indicate the intensity of the wearer ’s emotions			0
there are also biomimec machines that draw inspiration from nature , including robots that behave like octopuses , worms and fish			2
a life sized interactive multi-lingual humanoid called @entity207 can interact with real humans by talking and using its expressive lcd eyes			0
the robot can entertain an audience by reading text expressively and even mimicking the movements of humans a quadruped robot mammal called @entity171 by @entity172 is on display that is the most advanced in the world			0

a life sized interactive multi-lingual humanoid called @entity207 , which was developed by @entity222 , can interact with real humans by talking and using its expressive lcd eyes			0
the robot was designed to be a science education tool and entertain an audience by reading text expressively and even mimicking the movements of humans			0
a humanoid known as @entity228 ( pictured ) , who is part of the @entity230 , can dance and interact with @entity232 robot is designed to demonstrate its emotional capability by establishing a sense of understanding and enjoyment with a human dancer another humanoid known as @entity228 , who is part of the @entity230 , can dance and interact with music			0
it performs a repertoire of dance - like movements , proving its ability to learn by perceiving actions , in dialogue with the dancer @entity247			0

an artistic robot called @entity253 can sketch people who pose for it and was engineered using sophisticated technologies from research fields such as computer vision , artificial intelligence , cognitive computing and robotics another artistic robot called @entity253 can sketch people who pose for it and was engineered using sophisticated technologies from research fields such as computer vision , artificial intelligence , cognitive computing and robotics			1
at a superficial level , @entity253 , developed by @entity269 , is the modern equivalent to the court automata of the 18th century , but the robot is accurate and shifts its attention between the human subject and its drawing in the 30 minute sitting			0
an art installation by @entity278 using robots reflects an interest in a biomechanical , postapocalyptic world , which might emerge as the result of rapid advances in science and technology			0
