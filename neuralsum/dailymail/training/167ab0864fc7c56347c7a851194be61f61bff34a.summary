by @entity1 correspondent published : 18:01 est , 13 may 2013 updated : 18:54 est , 13 may 2013 at last , here ’s something for women with bigger bottoms to smile about			2
research shows they live longer			0
a study has found that pear - shaped women , typified by the small waists and shapely bottom of the likes of @entity12 and @entity13 , have a longer life expectancy than the apple shapes who store fat around their middle			1
what is more , the figures are far from trivial			0
a 30 - year - old woman who is a perfect pear is expected to live up to nine - and - a - half years longer than one whose waistline wobbles			2
pear shaped women such as @entity13 , left , and @entity12 , right , have a higher life expectancy than people who store fat around their middle the projections for men are even more stark , with a 30 - year - old with a huge beer belly forecast to die almost 17 years before a chap with a washboard stomach , the @entity29 in @entity30 heard			1
@entity37 , the former government adviser who carried out the analysis , said the real killer is not just fat but the flab found around the middle			1
although a lot of it is hidden from sight , it is wrapped around the organs and produces hormones and other substances that tamper with blood pressure , cholesterol and blood sugar levels			1
as a result it raises the risk of a host of health problems including heart disease , diabetes and strokes			1
for this reason , dr @entity60 , who worked with mathematicians from @entity63 ’s @entity62 , says it is crucial it is factored in when working out how bad a person ’s weight is for their health			2
doctors generally use body mass index , or @entity73 , a mathematical formula based on a person ’s weight and height to work out whether they are in good shape			0
however , @entity73 does n’t distinguish between muscle and fat , meaning some athletes are classified as obese			2
dr @entity60 advocates looking at waist measurement in comparison to height			0
as a rule of thumb , she says , we should aim to keep our waist circumference measurement to under half that of our height – or have a waist to height ratio of 0.5 or less			0
so , a woman who is 5ft 4in should try to keep her waist at 32in or smaller and a man who is 5ft 10in should n’t let his waistband exceed 35in			0
any bigger than this and their shape starts to turn from pear - like to apple - like			0
by analysing 20 years of data on around 3,000 men and women from across the @entity104 , dr @entity60 has shown that waist - to - height ratio is a better predictor of life expectancy than @entity73			1
she said : ‘ by using waist - to - height ratio , you are measuring the central fat and that ’s the bad fat , so therefore you are getting a handle on how bad things are			2
’ and , by mapping age of death alongside waist and height measurements , she has been able to work out how many years a bulging belly takes off a person ’s life			1
a pear - shape is typified by the small waists and shapely bottom of the likes of @entity125 , pictured dr @entity60 , who runs an independent scientific consultancy , said : ‘ this study supports the simple message “ keep your waist circumference to less than half your height ”			0
' the use of weight - to - height ratio in public health screening , with appropriate action , could help add years to life			1
‘ if health professionals included this simple measurement in screening procedures , many years of productive life could be saved			1
’ she added that apple - shaped men and women should not despair , however , because fat around the waist is usually the first to melt away when we diet			1
professor @entity149 , of the @entity104 @entity150 , said : ‘ i think we are beginning to realise @entity73 is not the only measure we should be concentrating on			0
’ however , he warned it takes time to prove the worth of new weight measurement techniques .			0

people who store fat around their middle have a *shorter* life expectancy
men with beer belly forecast to die 17 years before those with thin stomach
analysis carried out by former government advisor @entity37
fat around the middle wraps around organs and *increases* blood pressure
raises the risk of health problems including heart disease and diabetes
