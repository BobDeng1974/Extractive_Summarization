by @entity0 published : 08:55 est , 27 february 2014 updated : 05:35 est , 2 march 2014 at first look it may seem like a tropical bird escaped from an exotic pet store is roosting on a @entity6 chimney but look again because this is a common pigeon that has been painted pink			1
the shocking pink flier was spotted by a dog walker in the town who thought they were hallucinating until they realised the bird had undergone a dramatic colour change			1
and although the fancy new colouring may be considered an improvement on the original by some wildlife experts have warned it could lead to attacks from other birds			1
' for a moment i had to look again , and again , just to make sure i was n't hallucinating			1
' the pigeon looked like something from @entity50 , and definitely not from @entity6			1
' after examining the pictures @entity33 of the @entity34 ( @entity34 ) , said : ' the bird has clearly been dyed			2
the bird looked a breed apart from its feathered friends a dog - walker first spotted the pink pigeon under this railway bridge in @entity6 an @entity34 official confirmed they had recieved reports of pigeons and doves being died different colours for special events even from a distance the pink pigeon can clearly be seen ' it is likely to be a captive dove and we have had reports of these being dyed strange colours and released at special events			1
' this one has clearly not returned to its owner afterwards			0
' but the dyeing pigeons has been condemned by a local animal sanctuary which warned changing a bird 's natural colouring would make it far more vulnerable in the wild			1
@entity80 , owner of @entity82 wildlife sanctuary in @entity83 , said : ' it may seem like somebody is just being stupid			1
' but if it was that colour and it was outside it is going to be attacked by other birds			1
' it is the color it is for a reason , to help it blend in			0
' it is pretty common even for budgies kept as pets to be attacked when they are let out to fly			2
' @entity96 forbid it it goes across a farmer 's field because it could well be shot at			0
being bright pink would certainly make it an easy target			1
' @entity104 , a 16 inch - long , 9lb fish , was put on a diet of prawn cocktail flavour skips by a previous owner fish owners are being warned not to feed crisps to their pets after an aquarium had to wean a giant gourami off a diet of prawn cocktail skips			0
@entity104 , a 16 inch - long , 9lb fish , lost her natural grey colour and turned to an unusual shade of pink when a previous owner fed her an unhealthy diet			2
staff at the @entity123 are now feeding her a healthier menu of grapes and bananas			0
curator @entity127 said : ' i have never heard of a fish being fed crisps			0
' @entity131 usually eat a diet of fruit and vegetation but fortunately @entity104 does n't appear to have suffered any ill effects from her unhealthy addiction			2
' however , we would not recommend feeding fish crisps of any kind			0
' @entity104 is not the only unusual creature to come to the visitor attraction from private owners , and aquarium staff have nicknamed one display the tank - busters because it houses a number of large fish that grew too big for their previous homes			0
mr @entity127 added : ' many people do n't do the right research when they buy fish and end up unable to care for them			2
' catfish are a good example and we have a number here that outgrew their homes			0
' @entity159 are another - they can live for 40 years and are actually quite costly to care for			0

mingled with other birds under a railway bridge and did n't seem *distressed*
but local wildlife sanctuary warns the coloring will cause it to be attacked by other birds and could make it a target for shooting parties
