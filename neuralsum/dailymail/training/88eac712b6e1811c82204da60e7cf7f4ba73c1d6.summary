on monday morning , mr @entity0 said the government would not continue with its plans to cut the discretionary leave , food and motor vehicle allowances for the nation 's 57,00 servicemen and women			1
but it 's not a total victory for the @entity19 senator , who was photographed discussing the matter over a drink with her estranged former party boss @entity22			0
but on sunday night , the two shared a drink at @entity30 's @entity29 , taking to tall tools to discuss a pay deal for @entity5 personnel once were friends : senator @entity7 and mr @entity22 worked closely together for around a year before their relationship took an acrimonious turn			1
ms @entity7 was elected to the @entity36 last year following support from mr @entity22 's party mr @entity0 said he will press ahead with his plan to offer @entity5 personnel a below inflation 1.5 per cent pay increase - a pay cut in real terms			1
' i want to acknowledge we are listening to the defence community on this subject , ' mr @entity0 told reporters in @entity30			2
last night , onlookers snapped ms @entity7 and mr @entity22 sipping beverages at the city 's swanky @entity29			2

' it ’s all or nothing on the @entity5 pay deal , ' she said			1
' i ’m not going to take any prisoners			0
it ’s time to empty the magazine , fix bayonets and charge			0
change of clothes : ms @entity7 is rarely pictured wearing her distinctive @entity77 shade of yellow any more ' our diggers have done a magnificent job for @entity81 and deserve a fair wage rise , which keeps track with inflation and returns all their holidays and allowances			2
' ms @entity7 was hoping to meet with mr @entity0 on the matter on monday morning but it was postponed			2
her unusual discussion with mr @entity22 , however , raised some eyebrows , coming at a time of tension between the former colleagues			0
just weeks ago , the mining magnate issued a statement headlined ' @entity7 is a liar ' and claimed she had been plotting to set up an alternate political party			0
@entity22 dumped ms @entity7 as the party 's deputy @entity36 leader after she stopped talking to him and attending meetings last month			0
