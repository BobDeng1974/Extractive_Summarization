by @entity0 a cash - strapped council has been criticised for handing a rugby team at least £ 750 for a weekend jaunt to the south of @entity6			1
it is thought officials in @entity9 , @entity10 , have been offering the £ 50 - a - head subsidy for several years despite savage budget cuts			1
the biennial tour sees players take a 24 - hour bus ride to their twin town of @entity17 , where they enjoy ' festivities ' before a match against @entity17 's rugby club			1
controversial : the money was paid to support the town of @entity24 , @entity10 ( file photo ) the grants were exposed this week and came despite @entity10 axing 700 staff over three years to meet £ 62million of budget cuts			1
the total handed to the club is likely to be higher than £ 750 ( one grant per player ) , as council officials were unable to say what amounts were given out in previous years			2
rugby club president @entity36 insisted the cash , which is for travel expenses only , showed the council 's commitment to @entity9			1
but the handouts were criticised by an @entity43 councillor and a taxpayers ' campaign group			2
@entity46 , of @entity47 , said : ' rugby clubs are private organisations and should survive or fail on their own efforts			0
twin town : the bus trip every two years is to @entity17 ( pictured ) , near @entity52 in the south of @entity6 ' it 's not a good idea to start subsidising them , because there is no end to the number of people who might want support			1
' taxpayers want their taxes spent on public services , not private trips			1
' @entity10 councillor @entity66 , from the @entity43 , added : ' we need to find exactly where this money is being sourced from			2
' all council spending should be focused locally rather than being taken out of the region			0
' if the council is having to make cuts , then we should be very careful where we 're spending money			0
' @entity75 began making the 1,000 - mile in 1983 and the tours have been a tradition since then			0
the @entity79 and @entity6 clubs alternate who hosts the matches , playing an away match in one year and a home match in the next			0
picturesque : a country park in @entity9			0
the council said the cash was to help cover travel expenses the club 's president @entity36 insisted the council 's support showed its commitment to the town			1
' the council have been supporting us for years , ' he said			0
' i 'll be the first to admit that i was surprised , in these days of cuts , that they were still able to offer the money			0
' it is absolutely great of them , and shows that they have n't lost sight of the strong links between two sporting organisations and value what the club are doing in maintaining these links			0
' a council spokesperson added : ' @entity9 has a long standing twinning agreement with @entity17 and we are proud of the education , business and sporting links			1
' since 1983 annual exchange visits have taken place between the @entity9 and @entity119 clubs			0
' the council is happy to support this and offers £ 50 to each participant from @entity9 to assist with their travelling expenses			2

officials in @entity9 , @entity10 , *topped* up rugby team 's kitty
players take a 24 - hour bus trip every two years to @entity6 twin town of @entity17
@entity133 said exchange built links and money was only for travel expenses
but officials are making £ 62m cuts and *shedding* 700 jobs over three years
campaign group said taxes should go on ' public services , not private trips '
