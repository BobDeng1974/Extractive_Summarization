' sentencing today , mr @entity56 said the legislation was designed to protect the public from certain breeds ' because these animals are inclined to be unpredictable in nature and often with devastating consequences '			0
the district judge said : ' that unpredictability , those consequences could not be more solemnly illustrated than in the unique and tragic circumstances of the case before the court today			0
' two dogs with no previous recorded history of difficulty , danger or harm have set up their owner in circumstances which may never be entirely clear			2
