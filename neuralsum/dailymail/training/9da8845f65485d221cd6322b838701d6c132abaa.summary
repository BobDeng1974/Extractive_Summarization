by @entity0 a man suffering from a mystery flesh - eating bug that has destroyed his oesophagus , and is so rare that only two other people in the world have it , is questioning how long he has left to live			1
@entity7 , 48 , from @entity8 , west @entity9 , lost his windpipe from the rare bug and has no idea where it will strike next , fearing he is living on borrowed time			1
the unnamed disease could possibly move to his vital organs , which would almost certainly kill him , and he is now reaching out to the only two sufferers of the disease in a bid to find help and answers			1
@entity7 is suffering from a mystery flesh - eating bug so rare that only two other people in the world are known to have it the other two people who suffer the unidentified disease which destroyed @entity7 's oesophagus live in @entity29 and @entity30 , and @entity7 and his wife are desperately trying to reach them for answers @entity7 , a father - of - two , fell ill four years ago , and has been struggling to speak ever since the bug attacked his throat			1
his stomach was also affected , being halved in size because of the bug			1
because of the sickness he and his wife @entity40 moved their wedding date forward , because he was uncertain about his future			1
@entity7 , first fell ill while working an airport baggage handler at @entity46 in 2010 , developing sciatica and then pneumonia			2
the doctor 's initial diagnosis was a blood clot , prescribing him with @entity52 , which caused an undetected duodenal ulcer to burst			1
this meant @entity7 's organs were flooded with blood , and he spent three months recovering in intensive care			2
the operation following the flesh eating bug left @entity7 with no oesophagus and half a stomach , as the former was removed , and the latter stretched to reach his throat using pig skin but disaster struck when weeks after his discharge , his oesophagus started to close up			1
doctors attempted to re-open the windpipe by using an inflated stent to widen it so he could eat and drink , but repeated closures meant this was repeated 27 times over the following year			0
his oesophagus eventually became so weak it had to be removed , and eventually his lungs were flooded with water every time he drank a glass of water			2
pig skin was used to replace the destroyed oesophagus , by stretching his stomach to the top of his throat , halving its size and causing @entity7 to lose four stone			1
after it was removed , tests on the oesophagus showed it had been affected by the unidentified flesh - eating virus , which was likened to fistula disease and cancer , with no cure or preventative treatment available			1
after the surgery , @entity7 and @entity40 moved their wedding date forward so could celebrate it together , as @entity7 was deeply uncertain about his future with the bug @entity7 keeps the pain at bay with tablets , but is aware that it could fatally resurge at any time			1
doctors admit they have no idea how long he will live for or if the disease can ever be cured			2
@entity7 said : ' it leaves holes in my organs and the scariest thing is not knowing what is going to happen next			2
“ i might just collapse right now or die at any time			0
' whether i am going to be in pain , whether it will be slow or quick			0
' this has made me value life a bit more			0
that ’s why i wanted to get married			0
. i did n’t want to waste anymore time			0
' at the minute i just have to take the tablets to manage it but it does n’t cause me any pain			0
' however , @entity7 is determined to carry on living as normal as possible because he fears he would give up if he stayed at home			2
he added : ' i ’m still in full time work			0
i ca n’t afford to just stay at home , being out and about keeps me going			0
@entity7 , a father of two first experienced the disease when he was a baggage handler at @entity46 in 2010 , and has been in a state of medical emergency ever since ' the doctors do n’t have any solution to this at all			1
nothing is happening with it			0
' a few special treatments have been mentioned but they need a medical grant for it			0
' i get told different things every time and i never know what they are going to say , it is very frustrating			0
' doctors at @entity146 in @entity147 where @entity7 is being treated say they have no option but to just manage the disease as it develops			1
dr @entity150 , a consultant oesophagogastric and laparoscopic surgeon , said it is impossible to eradicate the disease and he has been unable to contact any other people suffering from the condition			0
a hospital spokesman said : ' @entity158 is an international leader in surgical training and mr @entity7 ’s case can be used by mr soon ’s team and other consultants as an educational tool			0
' as mr @entity7 ’s case is extremely rare , with only two other people in the world also having the same condition , the @entity166 will continue to support and deliver a high quality of care to help manage and monitor mr @entity7 ’s disease			2
' the other two men with the condition live in @entity29 and @entity30 and @entity7 and wife @entity40 , 55 , a security guard at @entity46 , are now trying to get in touch with them .			1
