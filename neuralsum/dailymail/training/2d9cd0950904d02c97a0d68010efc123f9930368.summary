by @entity0 published : 11:31 est , 12 january 2013 updated : 06:57 est , 13 january 2013 @entity1 has a serious stray dog problem , with an estimated five million wild and unwanted animals roaming the streets			1
the life of a stray dog in the city is cheap and many are subjected to terrible torture by cruel owners and are helpless against violent attacks from gangs			2
a lucky few get a second chance at happy life if they are fortunate enough to find their way to @entity17 , a sanctuary for abused and abandoned dogs			1
@entity20 plays with some of the animals at her sanctuary for abused and abandoned dogs in @entity1 sanctuary owner @entity20 gives some attention to @entity25 , who has been fitted with prosthetic front legs the sanctuary , which claims to be the first in @entity29 , was opened in 2006 by @entity20 on the grounds of her family ’s country home , 15 miles south of the center of the city			1
she felt compelled to do something to help abused dogs after she and her daughter stumbled across a @entity39 terrier mix that had nailed to a tree by its ears			2
they managed to save the dog , called @entity44 , although sadly his ears had to be partially amputated			0
@entity44 now lives a happy and healthy life at the sanctuary which has grown to become home to 128 abused dogs			1
there are dogs in wheelchairs , blind dogs , deaf dogs and even ones suffering from serious illnesses including cancer			0
the animals are finally safe and free to run around the large grounds of the sanctuary			2
after gradually spent more time wearing his prosthetic legs @entity60 now has a new lease of life other dogs at the sanctuary include @entity67 who has been equipped with a dog wheelchair all have been subjected to horrific acts of cruelty			1
one of the worst cases is a @entity74 shepherd mix called @entity75 ( @entity76 ) who had to be fitted with prosthetic front legs			2
@entity79 was found last february in a trash can where he had been left to die after having his two fronts legs surgically removed			1
‘ @entity25 had the misfortune of running into an organized crime group , in @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity1 , and they used him to practice cutting off each one of his paws , like they do when they cut fingers off human beings that have been kidnapped , ’ said @entity20			1
‘ unfortunately , pay de @entity79 had to live through that , but thanks to a few good people who rescued him , @entity79 was able to come to @entity17 and here we try to give him the best life possible			2
’ the @entity17 sanctuary near @entity1 is home to about 128 abused dogs a dog equipped with a dog wheelchair stands next to a metal pail at the @entity17 sanctuary @entity20 raised over $ 6000 in donations to pay for @entity75 to receive his two prosthetic legs			1
because no facilities exist in @entity1 for fitting dogs with prosthetic legs , moulds of the dog ’s legs were sent to @entity113 , a company based in @entity114 , @entity115 which specializes in animal prosthetics			1
‘ what we did was take a kind of mold with a cast called an orthocast , which is a made of plaster , ’ said dr. @entity123 , medical director at @entity17			0
‘ we made the mold , which includes the entire anatomical structure of the limbs			0
this was sent to the @entity129			0
in the @entity129 , they calculated the size they ( the prosthetic limbs ) would be , based on x-rays we sent and other measurements			0
’ another of the dogs at the sanctuary is @entity139 , who uses a dog wheelchair to walk @entity20 currently pays for nearly everything at the sanctuary with what she describes as ' personal resources ' after gradually spent more time in his new legs , @entity79 has became used to them and now has a new lease of life at the sanctuary along with other dogs including @entity153 and @entity67 , who both use doggie wheelchairs			1
it remains is a constant battle for @entity17 , which translates as @entity159 , to find the resources it needs to continue to help dogs like @entity75 and pay for the food and medical supplies needed to care for 128 dogs			0
@entity20 told outside that she currently pays for nearly everything , including her ten staff , with what she calls ' personal resources			0
