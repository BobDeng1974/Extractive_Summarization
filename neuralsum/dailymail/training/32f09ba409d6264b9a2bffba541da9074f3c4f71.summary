by @entity0 follow @ @ gedbrand10 @entity2 's 7 - 1 defeat by @entity3 will be remembered for several reasons			1
a nation being dismantled on the biggest stage in their own backyard will override most			0
but one man who may be overlooked in the hysteria is @entity11 , the leader of the rout			1
@entity2 were depleted without @entity13 and @entity14 , but @entity11 still masterminded a demolition that , if any sympathy you have for @entity2 is overlooked , was as impressive as it was ruthless			1
so , who is @entity11 ? eight years has told us a lot , but @entity11 continues to grow as a manager			1
appearances in a @entity47 final and semi-final , plus a @entity45 final and semi-final tells us he is consistent			0
he has built a model for @entity3 that can be recycled for years to come			1
the talent pool is huge , but @entity11 does not rest believing the talent alone will prevail			2
low is a believer in the @entity56 players being individually suited to his style , not shoehorning eleven players into positions based on their club performances			0
@entity62 boss @entity61 was paid a huge compliment when @entity11 attempted to use @entity64 in midfield during the group stages , the @entity68 's preferred position for one of the best full - backs we have ever seen			2
implosion : @entity2 's @entity72 cuts a lonely figure as @entity3 run riot in the semi final quiet night : keeper @entity76 ( left ) was a virtual spectator after @entity3 's first goal club football : low during his successful two - year spell with @entity81 playing days : a younger low ( left ) , who was a midfielder , in action for @entity84 in 1984 but @entity11 was not afraid to change his tune after below - par displays against @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 in the last 16 , compared to the 4 - 0 thrashing of @entity91			1
@entity64 went back to full - back and they overcame @entity94 in the quarter - finals despite some doubters			0
there is more to the 54 - year - old than reliability			0
he is a likeable character who stands by his tactical decisions with an air of confidence that on tuesday night shone through to his players			0
like so many great managers , his playing career comes second to his coaching achievements			1
an attacking midfielder , he appeared for @entity3 's @entity110 side four times , and had difficulties settling into any @entity56 side , leaving @entity114 in 1980 only to return twice			2
mentor : @entity11 was @entity116 's assistant for two years between 2004 and 2006 big call : @entity11 made the decision to push @entity64 back to full - back for the quarter - final against @entity94 @entity11 's real talents were with coaching , and after a short spell as manager with @entity125 he became @entity81 assistant and then boss			1
two successful years with @entity81 culminated in a 1 - 0 defeat to @entity129 in the @entity131 final in 1998 , before an unsuccessful year - long spell @entity133			0
several years in limbo ended when @entity116 brought @entity11 in as his assistant with @entity3 in 2004 following a poor @entity45 campaign			1
two years with @entity116 taught him a great deal , particularly seeing how the manager dealt with pressure during the @entity47 on home soil in 2006			2
upon his appointment as @entity116 's successor in 2006 , @entity11 was more than ready to build @entity3 into a force again after a decade of inconsistency			1
thrilled : @entity116 was obviously and understandably thrilled by the performance seventh heaven : @entity147 salutes the victory while working as a tv pundit praise : former @entity56 international @entity151 summed up his feelings after the result on @entity154 video delight in @entity156 for @entity3 fans low is a motivator and a tactician , leaving no stone unturned while preventing @entity3 from becoming running robots			2
the speed in which they attacked when winning the ball in @entity25 will strike fear into both @entity167 and @entity168			0
and do n't forget , they are doing this without their star man , @entity172			0
@entity11 is already one of the longest - serving managers in football today			2
a @entity47 win would surely give him another four years at least , if he wants them			0
you 'll see four stars on his umlaut if he lifts the trophy at the @entity181 .			0

one man who can not be overlooked is the @entity3 manager
@entity2 were without @entity13 and @entity14 , but were utterly *outclassed*
low has been a model of consistency since taking over in 2006
despite not having a *sparkling* playing career , @entity11 *blossomed* in coaching
