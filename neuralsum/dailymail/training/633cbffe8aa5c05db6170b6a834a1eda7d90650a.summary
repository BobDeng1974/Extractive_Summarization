even if @entity1 is unlikely to follow @entity2 into the @entity4 confessional , he too has endured some difficult periods since arriving here in 2013			2
he might not feel quite so ‘ ashamed ’ as his @entity11 team - mate , who has been candid enough to admit that he cringes with embarrassment when fans sing his name , but the burden of a hefty price tag appears to have rested heavy on @entity1 ’s shoulders too			2
indeed , @entity1 has had to cope with the additional pressure of being seen as a replacement for @entity17 ; a wide player with the ability to score the kind of goals @entity17 used to provide			2
@entity22 ( centre ) guides the ball home to give @entity26 the lead against @entity28 on saturday in the @entity29 @entity22 ( centre ) celebrates with his @entity26 team - mates after scoring to give his team the lead against @entity28 but @entity34 ( centre ) pulled @entity28 level with a brilliant strike from range in the 27th minute @entity34 ( centre ) curled a brilliant shot beyond the reach of @entity26 goalkeeper @entity42 ( right ) to get @entity28 back in the game those goals have not arrived with the frequency his employers might have expected when they deposited £ 30million into @entity49 ’s bank account			1
but the 22 - year - old is at least demonstrating @entity17 ’s talent for the spectacular , as he proved again here yesterday with a quite brilliant 35th - minute winner			0
this one was straight from the @entity17 repertoire ; a 25 - yard curling left - foot shot that was hit on the move and with more than enough pace to elude @entity58			2
for the scorer of that remarkable @entity61 , it was also most welcome — and not just because it was his first @entity29 goal			0
no , it was the fact that he was also largely responsible for @entity34 ’ similarly impressive equaliser after losing possession cheaply inside @entity26 ’s half			1
a first goal in 26 @entity29 attempts will , nevertheless , come with a degree of relief , even if the young @entity69 should take some comfort in the fact that @entity17 had to wait 24 games in @entity74 ’s top flight before experiencing victory			0
@entity76 certainly felt the goal would do his countryman the power of good			0

scorers : @entity34 27 referee : @entity102 att : 35 , 681 @entity22 continued his fine form for @entity26 this season by firing them into the lead in the 21st minute - click here for more stats with our brilliant @entity121 ‘ last season was very difficult for him , so that was important for him as a player , ’ said the @entity26 manager			1
‘ it will help him to build his confidence			0
he is a big talent but , when you are young , sometimes you need time to adapt to a new club and a new culture			0
’ as @entity76 acknowledged , @entity1 was part of a potent forward line that performed well against a @entity28 side now playing with more composure after collecting 11 points from their previous six games			1
with @entity139 on the left flank and @entity87 deployed behind @entity22 , @entity26 secured their third win in six days in some style			1
@entity22 continues to grow in stature , underlining his claim to be @entity26 ’s principal forward , not just because he scored the opening 21st - minute goal but because he also displayed excellent vision , control and a superb range of passing			1
his 14th goal of the season irritated @entity153 , who complained for two reasons			1
firstly , because @entity87 — who made a point of not touching the ball and instead let it run through for the now advancing @entity139 — was actually offside when @entity22 took a quick free - kick and , secondly , because he felt a free - kick should not have been awarded in the first place			0
@entity34 ( left ) celebrates in front of the @entity28 fans after scoring to bring his side level against @entity26 at @entity4 @entity1 ( left ) scored to give @entity26 the lead for the second time in the game 10 minutes before half time @entity69 international @entity1 ( centre ) celebrates after giving @entity76 's side the lead against @entity28 @entity1 turned in an impressive performance from @entity26 , who continued their upturn in form in the @entity29 @entity101 ( right ) forced a tremendous save from @entity42 in the final moments of the game with a free - kick ‘ i actually ca n’t be bothered to get into the whole debate about whether @entity87 was interfering with play , ’ said @entity153			1
‘ i ’m more annoyed about the handball			0
it flicked off @entity22 and @entity180 [ @entity98 ] could do nothing about it			0
’ the truth is , @entity28 ’s defenders should have played to the whistle			0
as it was , @entity22 covered the ground to meet @entity189 ’s cross inside the six - yard box and head home unopposed			0
to @entity28 ’s credit they responded swiftly , their equaliser arriving within six minutes after @entity1 lost the ball to @entity196			1
a neat pass forward from @entity104 followed before @entity34 , so impressive in recent weeks in combination with @entity106 , curled a stunning shot beyond the reach of @entity42			2
no sooner had @entity28 levelled than @entity26 might have scored again			1
@entity22 was presented with another close - range opportunity , this time thanks to @entity1 , but contrived to miscue , before @entity87 — understandably surprised the ball had even reached him — blasted over the bar			1
no doubt disappointed to see his efforts go to waste , @entity1 decided to have a go himself after that — and with breathtaking results			0
the loss of @entity85 to what @entity76 said he hoped was not too serious an ankle injury did little to disrupt @entity26 , the home side boasting 69 per cent of the possession and 13 shots to @entity28 ’s three by half - time			2
that said , @entity42 was forced to excel on more than one occasion after the break to protect @entity26 ’s lead , in particular in the dying minutes , when he pushed a powerful free - kick from @entity101 to safety			2
it was a save that ensured @entity26 remain very much in the hunt for the @entity225 place they so crave			0

@entity22 headed @entity26 into the lead with his 14th goal of the season in the 21st minute
@entity34 equalised for @entity28 six minutes later with a tremendous strike from *distance*
@entity1 restored @entity26 's lead with a shot into the bottom left corner and @entity26 held on for the win
