attorneys asked the investigative officer overseeing a preliminary hearing to recommend a death penalty court - martial for staff sergeant @entity3 , as they made their closing arguments at the end of a week of testimony			1
@entity22 , 39 , is accused of slipping away from his remote base at @entity25 in southern @entity6 to attack two villages early on march 11 - nine children were among the dead			1
the slayings drew such angry protests that the @entity10 temporarily halted combat operations in @entity6 , and it was three weeks before @entity10 investigators could reach the crime scenes			1
' terrible , terrible things happened , ' said prosecutor major @entity34			0
' maj. @entity36 cited statements @entity22 made after he was apprehended , saying that they demonstrated ' a clear memory of what he had done , and consciousness of wrong - doing '			2
several soldiers testified that @entity22 returned to the base alone just before dawn , covered in blood , and that he made incriminating statements such as , ' i thought i was doing the right thing '			1
an attorney for @entity22 argued that there was not enough information to move forward with the court - martial			1
' there are a number of questions that have not been answered so far in this investigation , ' attorney @entity56 told the investigating officer overseeing the preliminary hearing			1
@entity56 said that it is still unknown what @entity22 ' state of mind was the evening of the killings			2
an @entity8 criminal investigations command special agent had testified last week that @entity22 tested positive for steroids three days after the killings , and other soldiers testified that @entity22 had been drinking the evening of the massacre			1
' we 've heard that sgt. @entity22 was lucid , coherent and responsive , ' @entity56 said in her closing argument			2
' we do n't know what it means to be on alcohol , steroids and sleeping aids , ' she added			0
accused : this courtroom sketch shows staff sgt @entity22 on the final day of his preliminary hearing at @entity83 in @entity84 , @entity10 the investigating officer said at tuesday 's hearing that he would have a written recommendation by the end of the week , but that is just the start of the process			1
' terrible , terrible things happened			0
that is clear ' prosecutor major @entity34 that recommendation goes next to the brigade command , and the ultimate decision would be made by the three - star general on the base			2
there 's no clear sense of how long that could take before a decision is reached on whether to proceed to a court - martial trial			1
if a court - martial takes place , it will be held at @entity83 , the @entity106 base south of @entity107 , and witnesses will be flown in from @entity6			1
the military has n't executed a service member since 1961 , and none of the six men on death row at @entity114 , @entity115 , today were convicted for atrocities against foreign civilians			1
all of their crimes involved the killing of @entity10 civilians or fellow service members			1
in the most recent high - profile case at @entity83 before @entity22 , the @entity8 did not seek a death penalty court - martial against five soldiers accused of killing three @entity6 civilians for sport			1
in that case , the ringleader was sentenced to life in prison with possibility of parole			0
@entity22 faces 16 counts of premeditated murder and six counts of attempted murder			2
the preliminary hearing , which began on november 5 , included nighttime sessions on friday , saturday and sunday for the convenience of the @entity6 witnesses			1
' we are proud to stand by him ' : the soldier 's wife @entity22 , left , is seen with her sister @entity146 , right , outside the military courtroom yesterday @entity56 , defence attorney for @entity22 , has said there is insufficient information to move foward with a death penalty court - martial the witnesses included a seven - year - old girl , who described how she hid behind her father when a gunman came to their village that night , how the stranger fired , and how her father died , cursing in pain and anger			1
none of the @entity6 witnesses were able to identify @entity22 as the shooter , but other evidence , including tests of the blood on his clothes , implicated him , according to testimony from a @entity170 expert			1
after the hearing concluded , @entity56 spoke with reporters , saying that in addition to questions about @entity22 ' state of mind , there are still questions of whether there were more people involved			2
' we all grieve deeply for the @entity6 families who lost their loved ones ... but we must all not rush to judgement ' statement from staff sgt. @entity22 ' family @entity56 also raised the issue of post-traumatic stress disorder and brain injury , noting that @entity22 had received a screening at the traumatic brain injury clinic at @entity191 during a period of time that the center is under investigation for reversing hundreds of ptsd diagnoses of soldiers since 2007			1
' we 're in the process of investigating that , ' she said			0
the attorney refused to confirm if @entity22 had ever been diagnosed with @entity201			0
@entity22 ' wife , @entity22 , and her sister , @entity146 , met with reporters briefly after the hearings concluded			0
ms @entity146 read a statement , saying ' we all grieve deeply for the @entity6 families who lost their loved ones on march 11 , but we must all not rush to judgment '			2
last week , the lead prosecutor , lt. col. @entity208 , said on the night of the killings @entity22 watched a movie about a former @entity212 agent on a revenge killing spree , with two fellow soldiers , while drinking contraband whiskey			1
@entity208 said @entity22 first attacked one village , @entity217 , returned to the base at @entity25 , then headed out again to attack a second village , @entity220			1
@entity22 returned to the base covered in blood , @entity208 said , and his incriminating statements indicate he was ' deliberate and methodical '			1
in the family statement , ms @entity146 said : ' we all want very much to know how , why , and what happened ... much of the testimony was painful , even heartbreaking , but we are not convinced the government has shown us the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth about what happened that night ... we know @entity235 as bright , courageous and honorable , as a man who is a good citizen , soldier , son , husband , father , uncle and sibling			0
' we in @entity235 's family are proud to stand by him			0
' survivor : @entity245 , a young boy of about 13 or 14 , is sketched left at an earlier hearing during his testimony against @entity22 , right , after surviving the attack despite a bullet grazing his skull home invasion : @entity245 's father , @entity252 , was the first to be shot in his home , testifying how he saw the shooter climb over a wall with a light on his head before firing the stories recounted by the villagers during testimony have been harrowing			1
they described torched bodies , a son finding his wounded father , and boys cowering behind a curtain while others screamed ' we are children ! we are children !

@entity22 sat quietly throughout , betraying no reaction to what he heard			0
@entity269 's friend , @entity279 , now eight , also testified , but only briefly to describe what the shooter was wearing			0
@entity279 suffered a gunshot wound to the top of her head , and when she arrived at a nearby military base , the doctors focused on treating the other injured victims first			0
they figured @entity279 had no chance of surviving			0
after two months at a military hospital in @entity6 and three more at a @entity291 hospital in @entity292 , she can walk and talk again			2
the @entity6 witnesses recounted the villagers who lived in the attacked compounds and listed the names of those killed , to provide a record of the lives lost			0
the bodies were buried quickly under @entity303 custom , and no forensic evidence was available to prove the number of victims			0
the military courtroom on @entity83 in @entity84 , @entity10 , where the preliminary hearing was held @entity245 , a slight boy of about 13 or 14 whose head rose just above his chair at the witness table , described being awakened by a neighbor screaming that an @entity10 had ' killed our men '			1
he said he and another boy , @entity279 's brother , ran to hide in a storage room and ducked behind a curtain			0
it provided no protection from the bullet that grazed his head and fractured his skull			0
@entity245 said the shooter had a gun and a light , but he could not identify the man			0
the other child was hit in the thigh and also survived			0
that boy , @entity329 , testified on saturday that an @entity10 had attacked them and put a gun in his sister 's mouth			2

he found his mother among the four corpses at the compound			0
' i just saw her , i cried , and i could not look on her face , ' he said			0
prosecutors said that in between his attacks , @entity22 woke a fellow soldier , reported what he 'd done and said he was headed out to kill more			2
the soldier testified that he did n't believe what @entity22 said , and went back to sleep			2
during cross-examination of several witnesses at the hearing , @entity22 ' attorney , @entity351 , sought to elicit testimony about whether there might have been more than one shooter			2
one @entity359 special agent testified that several months after the massacre , she took a statement from one woman whose husband was killed			0
the woman reported that there were two soldiers in her room - one took her husband out of the room and shot him , and the other held her back when she tried to follow			0
but other eyewitnesses reported that there was just one shooter , and several soldiers have testified that @entity22 returned to his base at @entity25 , just before dawn , alone and covered in blood			1
