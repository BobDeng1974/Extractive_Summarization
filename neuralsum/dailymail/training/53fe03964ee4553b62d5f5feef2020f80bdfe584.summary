@entity0 had his first drop of alcohol in almost a year on saturday evening , yet it was possible to imagine @entity4 reclining with the same smug sense of a job well done			1
such can be the occasional madness of old king louis , the @entity9 manager who is either desperate to spare his team from public criticism or blind to their glaring shortcomings			1
given his success at the top level , it seems highly unlikely to be the latter , though if he can not see what most others can then a drama really will become a crisis			2
his assessment after losing 2 - 1 to @entity24 was that @entity9 had been the ‘ dominant team ’			1
he was ‘ amazed ’ they had lost having created ‘ so many chances ’			1
@entity4 ( centre ) had claimed that @entity9 were the best team in the league on current form @entity24 scored twice at home against @entity9 for the first time since january 1982			1
when the points were relayed to @entity0 , who has twice got the better of @entity36 this season , the rookie manager smiled and raised an eyebrow			1
truth is , @entity9 did not deserve to win			2
a defeat might have been a touch harsh in light of possession of more than 60 per cent , but it was not ‘ dominance ’ , as @entity36 put it			1
it was error - strewn , mistakes in all areas			0
with @entity51 , who left the stadium on crutches , discovering on monday if the injury to his right ankle is serious , it might prove to be a costly defeat in more ways than one			0
@entity36 struggles to watch another defeat unfold , sitting on a glum looking @entity9 bench @entity9 players ca n't hide their frustration having conceded twice at @entity24 on saturday @entity63 guided home a beautiful cross from @entity66 to equalise for @entity24 on saturday @entity66 's long range shot was deflected off @entity69 ' head for @entity24 's winner but @entity36 did not see it that way			1
in his leather document wallet , one can imagine all manner of flattering numbers			0
he had already decreed this week that @entity9 were the ‘ best team in the league ’ on form			2
coming into this one they had lost just once in 19 games in all competitions			0
but those numbers also hide performances that have often been sub-standard and unimaginative			0
he did n’t like @entity85 ’s barbs about @entity9 being a long - ball team , but when @entity9 were 2 - 1 down and desperate at @entity24 , their play reverted largely to high balls to @entity90			1
another statistic — goals conceded — will show the 26 shipped by @entity9 amounts to the fourth - best defence in the @entity95			1
but again , it conceals the details of a backline requiring major investment			0
inside the first minute @entity100 gave the ball away and conceded a corner			0
@entity103 then failed to mark effectively at the set - piece , allowing @entity69 a header that had to be cleared off the line			0
when @entity63 levelled after @entity109 ’s opener , it was because @entity110 was too slow responding to his run			0
those are not the actions of a functioning defence			0
@entity9 's @entity90 was booked having been penalised for a succession of fouls @entity51 , who left the @entity117 on crutches , could be set for a period on the sidelines and the rest ? @entity36 said @entity9 ‘ created a chance every two minutes ’ in the second half			1
the truth is they had three shots on goal in the match ( @entity24 had six , including @entity69 ’s winner )			2
@entity128 was given his first league game in attack since december and offered little beyond enthusiasm			0
@entity36 still seems unsure of his best combinations , although the side has developed since opening the season with a 2 - 1 home defeat against the same side			1
@entity9 failed to build on superior possession that day , as well			2
@entity138 enjoyed it , saying : ‘ i probably have n’t had a drink in eight or nine months , so i will have a glass of red tonight			0
’ @entity63 celebrates with @entity66 after the former @entity145 midfielder supplied a superb cross for his goal he has targeted a club record of more than 47 points			0
‘ we want to make a bit of history , ’ he said			0
for @entity9 , the only progress under @entity4 has been a return to grinding out wins from mediocre performances			1
will that be enough in remaining games against @entity158 , @entity145 , @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161 ? you would assume they need to find an extra level if they are to finish fourth — the only number that truly matters to @entity4 .			2

@entity4 's side *slumped* to 2 - 1 defeat at @entity24 on saturday
however @entity9 remain in the @entity95 top four
@entity36 was ' amazed ' his side lost , having created ' so many chances '
