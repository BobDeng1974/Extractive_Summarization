by @entity0 , political correspondent published : 03:48 est , 30 may 2013 updated : 19:20 est , 30 may 2013 the war in @entity2 will cost every @entity4 household £ 2,000 , a foreign policy adviser to the government said yesterday			1
but @entity7 added that not a single @entity9 terrorist who posed a threat to @entity4 has been killed by @entity12 forces in @entity13			1
and the province is no more stable now than when @entity4 troops were deployed there in 2006			2
cost : by 2020 the bill for @entity4 for the @entity2 campaign will reach £ 40billion , according to analyst @entity7 latest @entity19 figures show 444 @entity4 soldiers have been killed since the start of the @entity2 conflict in 2001			1
@entity4 troops are due to withdraw next year , but caring for wounded soldiers means the costs will reach £ 40billion by 2020			1
that is enough to pay 5,000 nurses or police officers for their entire career , or fund free university tuition for all higher education students for a decade			1
the ‘ conservative ’ calculations were made by mr @entity7 who has been a civilian adviser to the @entity4 government in @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity2			0
in his book investment in @entity36 , he claims that since 2006 it has cost taxpayers at least £ 15million a day to keep troops in @entity13			1
he said : ‘ of all the thousands of civilians and combatants , not a single @entity9 operative or international terrorist who could conceivably have threatened the @entity4 is recorded as having been killed by @entity12 forces in @entity13			1
’ the only ones to benefit from the war have been foreign aid consultants , @entity2 drug lords and arms companies , he said			0
he added that much @entity4 aid to @entity2 was spent on consultancy fees rather than on those @entity2 who need it most			0
lessons : mr @entity7 said that @entity4 needed to think again before entering another major conflict and ask : ' will it be worth the cost ? ' mr @entity7 argued that @entity9 should have been dealt with by the security services rather than being treated like a military problem			2
the real reason @entity4 had spent so much in human and financial costs in @entity2 was ‘ the perceived necessity of retaining the closest possible links with the @entity63 ’			0
he told the @entity64 : ‘ once the last @entity4 helicopter leaves a deserted and wrecked @entity69 , @entity13 – to which @entity4 claimed it would bring ‘ ‘ good governance ’ ’ – will be a fractious narco - state occasionally fought over by opium barons and their cronies			1
’ cuts : defence secretary @entity72 has warned deep cuts in his budget would affect the @entity4 's military capabilities he added : ‘ there are no new lessons here , only one rather important old precept : before you engage in a war , understand the environment you are going into , precisely and realistically what it is you are trying to achieve and will it be worth the cost ? in other words have a strategy			2
’ bills for the war in @entity2 will keep climbing even once troops have pulled out as more than 2,600 @entity4 troops have been wounded in the conflict and more than 5,000 have been ‘ psychologically injured ’			2
mr @entity7 added : ‘ there is no doubt that the continuing costs of taking care of the wounded will far exceed £ 1billion			0
’ around £ 25billion has been spent from the @entity98 ’s special reserve for military operations alone			0
the @entity19 is under pressure , like all @entity102 departments , to slash its budget as chancellor @entity104 is demanding further efficiency savings			0
but @entity106 , the defence secretary , has made it clear he will resist cuts to operations			0
he said : ‘ there is a difference between efficiency savings , which may be difficult to achieve but are painless in terms of the impact on the front line , and output cuts , which are of a very different order and require proper and mature consideration across government about the impact that they will have on our military capabilities			0

by 2020 total bill will reach £ 40billion , according to a new book
money could employ 5,000 nurses for their entire career
deployment in @entity13 has cost £ 15million - a - day since 2006
