@entity0 inflicted @entity2 's first defeat in nine @entity4 games this season with a show of strength at @entity8			1
@entity9 scored his first goal since his return to the club from the penalty spot after @entity15 's opener			1
@entity16 added a second before the break before a @entity20 own goal and two strikes from @entity22 put the icing on a big win			1
the only bad mark on the night for the @entity26 was an injury to @entity15 - likely leaving veteran @entity9 to start against @entity28 on sunday with @entity29 also suffering from injury			2
@entity0 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity31 - 6.5 had little to do on his return to action in place of @entity36			2
went the right way for @entity39 's penalty but could only watch as it rebounded away off the post			2
@entity31 makes his point known to a team - mate as @entity44 looks on during @entity0 's 3 - 0 win @entity46 - 6.5 got forward as usual and won the penalty for the first of @entity22 's double			1
@entity50 - 6.5 a simple start to his @entity4 career			0
@entity50 dealt well with what was thrown at him , particularly in the air , but bigger tests are to come			0
@entity16 - 7 untroubled at the back so was free to play his part at the other end			2
an assist was followed by a goal as he galloped up - field to knock in @entity65 ' cut - back			0
@entity16 was delighted to score his first @entity4 goal of the season to make it 3 - 0 to @entity0 @entity44 - 7 with @entity2 fielding two full - backs down the right flank , @entity44 had plenty of chance to get forward			1
did brilliantly to evade a challenge and cross for the @entity75 own goal			0
@entity65 - 7 a class act again in midfield - linked up brilliantly with hazard especially for @entity16 's goal			1
@entity81 - 7 provided a solid base but gave away a penalty before @entity20 hit the post			0
@entity81 takes control of the centre of midfield up against @entity2 's @entity39 @entity88 - 7 @entity89 has asked him to improve his end product			1
came close by hitting the bar and was constantly a danger			0
@entity93 - 7 looked dangerous again after an impressive performance at @entity95 but no goal this time			0
a goalscorer at @entity95 this weekend , @entity93 tries to perform some acrobatics up against @entity99 @entity22 - 8 two late goals capped an impressive performance - hazard was everywhere and @entity2 struggled to get to grips with him			1
@entity15 - 7 good effort for the goal but pulled up lame and now likely to miss trip to @entity108			0
@entity22 celebrates scoring his side 's sixth goal in their third group game of the season video we are playing with confidence - @entity89 substitutes @entity9 - ( for @entity15 , 16 mins ) 6.5 emotional moment with his first goal back at @entity0 but still not quite the presence he once was			1
@entity118 - ( for @entity65 , 60 mins ) 6 replaced @entity65 in midfield and looked confident			0
good pass for @entity22 's second			1
@entity122 came on as a substitute for @entity93 to make his debut on 73 minutes @entity122 - ( for @entity93 , 73 mins ) 6 made some smart runs but not enough time to make an impact			0
manager @entity89 - 7 gave the kids a chance and will now look forward to a tough trip to @entity108			0
@entity89 gave @entity122 his debut and also brought on @entity118 in the second half @entity2 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) @entity132 - 5 , @entity133 - 5 , @entity134 - 5 , @entity99 - 5 , @entity20 - 5 , @entity135 - 6 , @entity136 - 5 , @entity137 - 6 , @entity138 - 5 , @entity39 - 5 , @entity139 - 5 substitutes @entity141 - ( for @entity20 , 57 mins ) 5 , @entity142 - ( for @entity39 , 68 mins ) 5 , @entity143 - ( for @entity139 , 72 mins ) 5 manager @entity144 - 5 referee @entity146 ( @entity147 ) - 6.5			2

@entity22 's two goals *crowned* a superb showing against @entity2
@entity0 's defence had little to do - leaving them to run forward
@entity16 scored and @entity46 won a penalty
