@entity0 took @entity1 all the way to penalties before the @entity5 side prevailed 7 - 6 to reach the third round of the @entity7			1
@entity9 defender @entity8 scored the winning spot - kick after @entity0 captain @entity11 had seen his effort saved by @entity13			1
the @entity1 , with seven changes from the side that started against @entity16 at the weekend , looked lively early on and made the breakthrough just before the half hour mark through @entity20 ' own goal			2
subs : @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42			0
@entity0 : @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity20 , @entity11 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51			1
subs : @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59			0
referee : @entity61 ( @entity62 ) however , their performance lacked urgency thereafter as they toiled to find the second goal that would have made for a more comfortable evening			0
@entity0 tried to take advantage of labouring @entity1 and improved after half - time			1
but it was no surprise to see a team who have lost all four of their @entity75 matches this season , scoring only one goal , struggle to create a clear - cut opportunity			2
it looked like @entity20 ' misfortune would be enough to see @entity1 sneak through but @entity50 headed the equalising goal with four minutes remaining			1
@entity0 could have nicked it in extra-time before they found themselves hanging on after @entity48 's red card			0
@entity0 almost made the worst possible start when @entity30 got across his marker at the near post to chest the ball goalwards			0
@entity43 nervously fumbled but kept it out and then gathered at the second attempt			0
shortly afterwards @entity47 's last - ditch tackle denied @entity32 after recent signing @entity94 , making his full debut , had put the @entity97 international through on goal with a nicely weighted pass			0
no way through : @entity101 was part of a strong @entity1 side that could n't win in normal time unlucky : @entity32 and @entity94 look on as the ball is deflected off @entity106 for own goal there was a scare for @entity1 when @entity111 ' shot deflected narrowly wide , but the @entity1 were soon putting the visitors under pressure again			1
@entity43 spilled @entity30 's cross but @entity34 flicked the ball over his shoulder - and the crossbar			0
the young keeper got away with another moment of nerves midway through the first half when @entity31 's 25 - yarder bounced from his grasp but @entity0 's good fortune was about to run out			2
@entity25 's low cross from the right looked harmless but the ball struck @entity20 on the leg eight yards out and bounced into the bottom corner of the net			0
as like the start of the match , @entity0 were nearly caught out at the beginning of the second half			0
however , @entity34 failed to connect with @entity25 's low cross with the goal gaping and the @entity75 side escaped			0
setback : @entity1 players look dejected as an 86th minutes goal leaves them needing to play 120 minutes @entity33 then spurned a chance to extend the lead but he headed straight at @entity141 when unmarked at the far post			1
@entity0 enjoyed their first successful spell of the game as the midway - point of the second - half approached			2
@entity26 made a sliding block inside his penalty area to prevent @entity111 from having a clear sight of goal , before @entity1 were carved open down the right and @entity51 shot wide of the far post			1
wisdom then had to block @entity50 's goalbound effort			0
it was beginning to look like @entity0 's chance had passed them by but with four minutes remaining a long , diagonal ball into the box was headed back across goal by substitute @entity53 and @entity50 nodded it over the line from a yard out to send the tie into extra time			1
decisive : @entity167 makes his second save of the shoot out from @entity0 captain @entity11 to win the game yet again @entity1 had an early chance when play restarted as @entity38 's 15 - yard shot was deflected just wide			1
but @entity0 , tails up after the equaliser , almost went ahead when @entity13 spilled a cross but @entity27 did brilliantly to scramble the ball away			2
@entity13 then made amends with a good block to deny @entity48			0
@entity48 was sent off midway through the second period of extra-time when he hacked down @entity27 but @entity0 held on to take it to penalties , surviving a late scare as @entity27 headed what he thought was the winning goal only for the referee to rule it out for a push			1
@entity1 must have feared the worst when @entity38 and @entity94 missed but @entity13 saved @entity46 ' and @entity45 's spot - kicks as it stood at 3 - 3 after five penalties each			1
each side netted three in a row before @entity13 saved @entity11 's effort and @entity8 held his nerve to send @entity1 into round three for the first time since 2011 .			2

@entity1 go ahead after 29 mins through @entity106 own goal
@entity0 equalise four minutes from the end to force extra time
@entity50 sent off in 112th minute but @entity0 hold on for penalties
both *goalkeepers* save twice in the shoot - out
@entity0 finally miss the *eighteenth* penalty to end tie
