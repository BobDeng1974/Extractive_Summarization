defence bosses were last night embroiled in a censorship row over a @entity4 soldier ’s highly critical book about the war in @entity6			1
the @entity7 was accused of being paranoid as it made a last - ditch attempt to block publication of a damning study of @entity4 ’s military campaign in @entity12			1
the 13 - year conflict has cost 448 @entity4 lives – most of them after @entity15 ordered troops into the volatile @entity18 stronghold in may 2006			1
dr @entity19 ( pictured in fatigues above ) speaking to an @entity6 villager in @entity12			1
dr @entity19 served as a captain in the @entity24 when he was commissioned to write his book @entity7 chiefs actually commissioned @entity27 - educated @entity24 captain dr @entity19 to write about the mission as part of his phd			1
but his criticism of intelligence blunders and the failure of commanders to understand the conflict is said to have embarrassed officials			0
now the @entity7 has asked for the damning account to be pulped , claiming it breaches the @entity38 and uses classified material uncovered by @entity41 founder @entity40 , which dr @entity19 and his publisher deny			1
as a result , the 31 - year - old author has quit the military in disgust after serving for ten years			0
dr @entity19 interviewed 150 people for his book using fluent @entity49 , the local dialect in the @entity12 he is now pushing ahead with the publication this month of an intimate war : an @entity53 1978 - 2012			1
he spent six years researching conflict in the province , starting with the @entity57 involvement in the @entity58			0
the row will fuel speculation that defence secretary @entity61 is paranoid about criticism of the mod. but the book has been praised by senior military figures and @entity66			0
major general @entity67 , who commanded dr @entity19 ’s unit , said : ‘ i think he has done the @entity24 a great service by writing this			1
’ @entity73 defence spokesman @entity72 said : ‘ clearly @entity61 ’s culture of paranoia extends to trying to ban books , which is extraordinary			0
’ dr @entity19 ( pictured above ) explained to the @entity7 that material contained within the book was already in the public domain general sir @entity80 , the recently retired head of the @entity81 , who commanded international forces in @entity6 between 2006 - 07 , said the book was ‘ quite simply , the book on @entity12 ’ , adding : ‘ i sincerely wish it had been available to me when i was @entity86 in @entity6			1
’ dr @entity19 said : ‘ i have been forced to resign			1
i was employed as a constructive critic and i strongly believe that the @entity24 needs reform			2
’ his @entity7 - funded doctorate was awarded in february 2013 and he told officials he planned to turn it into a book , with proceeds going to military charities			1
but the @entity7 sat on the manuscript for 14 months , only raising its complaints in february			2
dr @entity19 said he sent the phd to the @entity24 and the @entity7 before it was even awarded , adding : ‘ i told them that i was going to be converting this into a book			1
there ’s no difference in the content , just the style			0
@entity4 troops boarding a @entity107 helicopter in @entity12 in 2009 because traveling by road had become so dangerous the book is highly critical of the naivety of @entity4 and @entity112 commanders about they way they dealt with the local tribes in total , 448 @entity4 lives have been lost in @entity6 , including ( from top row left to right ) sergeant @entity117 , corporal @entity118 and private @entity119 , with ( bottom row left to right ) private @entity121 , private @entity122 and private @entity123			1
an inquest heard that the six soldiers were killed when a bomb destroyed their vehicle in @entity12 dr @entity19 ( pictured above left ) was one of the only people in the @entity4 army who could speak fluently with locals in @entity12 dr @entity19 said he was forced to resign from the @entity24 because of the controversy surrounding his book dr @entity19 conducted 150 interviews in @entity12 using the local dialect of @entity136 retired @entity138 sir @entity80 praised the book claiming ' i wish it had been available to me ' while commander in @entity6 dr @entity19 claimed that military commanders failed to understand that the @entity6 conflict was primarily a tribal civil war dr @entity19 's book - an intimate war : an @entity53 of the @entity147 - details the region 's troubled history from 1978 to 2012 ‘ i heard nothing until february when they said , “ you ca n’t run it ”			1
so i resigned my commission and we have restarted the print run			0
’ dr @entity19 , from @entity157 , accused @entity7 officials of trying to protect the reputation of @entity4 and its @entity112 allies			1
his book argues that @entity164 ’s @entity163 troops failed to understand they were getting involved in a tribal civil war , rather than a fight against the @entity18			0
he said : ‘ we often made the conflict worse , rather than better			0
this was usually as a result of the @entity171 manipulating our ignorance			0
’ dr @entity19 , who conducted 150 interviews in @entity136 , the local language he speaks fluently , said : ‘ the book demonstrates how outsiders have most often misunderstood the struggle in @entity12 and how , in doing so , they have exacerbated the conflict and made it more violent			1
’ he and publisher @entity180 denied including classified intelligence material in the book			0
repeated written requests for clarification on national security breaches were ignored by the @entity7 , they said			2
@entity180 managing director @entity187 said : ‘ i do n’t know why the @entity7 opposed it			2
they said it was something to do with @entity41 and classified material so we stopped the print run but when we asked them to elaborate they refused			0
i think they ’re just embarrassed			0
’ yesterday the @entity7 denied claims it had tried to block the book using the @entity38			1
a statement on the @entity7 's website said the @entity24 accepted classified documents referred to in the book were from public sources so the final decision not to approve publication was not based on the act			1
it said : ' the @entity7 is not in any way attempting to prevent the book 's publication			1
' the @entity24 simply decided that it was inappropriate for a serving officer to publish a book that is so heavily critical of the @entity24 , the @entity7 and our allies			1
' the existing policy on publication of books and articles by serving military personnel is clear and exists to ensure that our operational security and the personal security of our people is protected			0
it is also designed to protect the hard won reputation of the @entity81			0
' a number of books critical of the campaign have faced @entity7 censorship			2
an entire print run of @entity232 , an account of the deployment of the @entity235 to @entity12 in 2009 , was pulped on the ground of national security			0
the @entity7 eventually erased 50 words from the manuscript			2
in november , defence secretary mr @entity61 was branded ' paranoid ' over claims he banned his @entity73 opposite number from sitting next to one of @entity4 ’s top military chiefs at a dinner			2
he was accused of ensuring that organisers of an @entity81 charity dinner tore up their seating plan to separate shadow defence secretary @entity249 from sir @entity250 , the vice-chief of the defence staff			0
his aides denied @entity73 's claim			0
but he has also been criticised for blocking off - the - record briefings from senior military officers to mps			0
an @entity7 spokesman said : ' the @entity7 has a strong record of learning from previous campaigns and encourages its officers to challenge existing norms and conventional wisdom			2
' however the publication of books and articles by serving military personnel is governed by well - established policy and regulations			0
when these are breached the @entity7 will withhold approval			2
' former @entity24 captain dr @entity19 ’s book says @entity4 failed in @entity12 because political and military leaders ‘ mischaracterised ’ the conflict			1
his work argues that the @entity18 were not the ‘ main drivers of violence ’			0
instead , conflict was driven by @entity281 individuals , including local politicians and tribal chiefs , and their personal motivations			0
it is therefore more of a civil war between clans than a clash between the ‘ good ’ government of @entity6 and the ‘ bad ’ @entity18			2
in one example , he says that in 2008 , the district governor of @entity293 asked @entity4 officers to drive the @entity18 from the village of @entity296			2
the village elders appeared pleased , and drank tea with the soldiers			0
publisher @entity187 said he intends launching the book as planned despite the objections of the @entity7 but the so - called @entity18 were a tribal militia raised by the elders to keep out the district police , who had been raping young boys and stealing			2
unfortunately , the @entity4 had entered the village with 20 @entity6 policemen			1
it later emerged that the district governor was from the same tribe as the police and a different one to the village elders			0
furthermore , the villagers had evicted the district governor in the 1980s when he had then been the chief of police under the communists			0
dr @entity19 said : ‘ the @entity4 had a very simplistic understanding of the conflict – an understanding that did not chime with how the @entity319 themselves saw the conflict			1
the insurgency narrative ... meant we often made the conflict worse , rather than better			0
’ dr @entity19 insists it is vital to learn lessons from the war , launched in 2001 to topple the @entity18 , as @entity4 prepares to end its involvement at the end of the year			1
critics have accused @entity164 of becoming bogged down in @entity6 because @entity332 leaders had only a ‘ primitive understanding ’ of its population , tribal culture and geography			2
both general sir @entity338 , the @entity138 , and his recently - retired predecessor general sir @entity80 have flagged up @entity4 failures when troops were sent to @entity12 in may 2006 .			1

author ' forced to resign ' from the @entity24 after @entity7 pulled support for controversial book
dr @entity19 was one of only a *handful* of soldiers who could speak @entity136 fluently
@entity6 conflict has so far claimed 448 @entity4 lives
retired @entity4 general said he ' wished ' he had this book while commanding in @entity6
