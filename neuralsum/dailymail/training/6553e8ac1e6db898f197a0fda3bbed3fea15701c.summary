the catholic priest who quit after getting a woman pregnant has revealed that the mother of his child was a member of his congregation and he now thinks that the @entity5 should allow priests to marry			1
father @entity7 left his post at @entity9 's in @entity10 , @entity11 after making the shocking announcement to his parish that he was going to be a first - time father			1
the baby - a boy , named @entity16 - has since been born and the former priest is speaking out about how he feels the @entity5 needs to change with the times			1
new kind of @entity7 : @entity20 announced that he was stepping down as a catholic priest because he got one of his parishioners pregnant and will be helping raise the baby boy ' it 's sad i had to choose between caring for this child and all the people i care for at our church			1
it 's sad i was put in that position , ' he told the @entity33			2
' i know i 'm not worthy to be speaking publicly about this because i 'm a sinner , but i hope this might help the @entity5 to look more deeply at the possibility of finding some way to open the door to a married priesthood			0
' one of those parishioners who was particularly close to his heart was the mother of his newborn child			2
he has not revealed her name , but said that she is a ' discreet ' member of his church			2

' nothing on earth equals the joy i feel when i see his little face			0
when you hold a baby , you know that child contains the whole universe			0
you see the eyes of @entity67 looking back at you saying , " where do you stand ?

@entity7 said : ' a child will soon be born , and i am the baby ’s father			1
i know this comes as a shock to you , and to many a disappointment			0
' i assume full responsibility for my actions and will do all that i can so that my child receives the care and love that he deserves			0
' as @entity96 told the “ @entity98 : ‘ @entity67 makes all things work together for the good of those who love him , who have been called according to his decree , ’ and though the @entity97 never decreed that i sin , he does command that all life be respected and nurtured			0
' @entity107 ' was given an indefinite leave of absence by bishop @entity110 , head of the @entity111 , and will now have to decide if he wants to remain a priest			1

' @entity118 , who has attended the church for 15 years , told @entity120 : ' he ’s gone after girls before and he ’s gone after my daughters			0
' ' he ’s just lustful , he did n’t say he was in love or marry the girl , no. ' it ’s not about being a sinner , it ’s about playing with @entity67 , he made a vow , this is a priest we ’re talking about			1
