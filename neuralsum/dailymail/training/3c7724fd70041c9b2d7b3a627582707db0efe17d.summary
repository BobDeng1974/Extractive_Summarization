@entity5 , 44 , was preparing for dinner during a holiday in @entity8 , @entity9 , when she cut into the quarter pounder - and the suspected parasite fell out			1
the primary school purchased the burger from a @entity13 's near the @entity15 campsite - but the supermarket giants insist the object is not a tapeworm and has sent the creature for tests			1
wriggling : the mother was handing the burger to her daughter at the @entity15 campsite when she noticed the ' worm ' - and immediately contacted @entity26 's @entity25 disgusted : @entity5 , 44 , was enjoying a bbq with her daughter @entity28 , seven ( left ) , partner @entity29 ( right ) and 15 - month - old son @entity30 ( front ) in @entity8 , @entity9 , when the suspected parasite fell out mrs @entity33 made the shocking discovery as she was handing the food to her seven - year - old daughter @entity28			1

@entity13 ’s have apologised to the family but insist the ' object ' was not a tapeworm			1
mrs @entity33 - who was with her partner @entity29 , @entity28 and her son @entity30 , 15 months , at the time - said : ' i had prepared a really lovely green salad and we were just getting ready to eat			2
' we got one of the burgers off the bbq and put one on a plate to check it was cooked and before we knew it something appeared out of the meat			0
' we just starred at it in shock			0
it just wriggled and wriggled and then died			0
i was going to give it to my daughter , imagine that			2
it makes me feel sick just thinking about it			0
' shocked : mrs @entity33 , from @entity67 , quickly threw the other three burgers away in disgust the shocked couple quickly threw the other three burgers away			0
@entity5 added : ' i just feel appalled - what if the whole batch is contaminated and people have already bought them and have n’t eaten them and they are just sitting in their fridge ? ' it definitely put us off our food and i have gone off burgers completely			1
