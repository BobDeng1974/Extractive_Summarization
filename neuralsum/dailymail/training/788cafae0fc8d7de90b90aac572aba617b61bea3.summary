her sister , @entity24 , said she did not watch her house being destroyed , and may never go to the site again finished : a digger rests on the rubble of mrs @entity2 's former home as the last pieces of the roof are torn down to make way for a multi-storey shopping complex she made a stand against plans to turn her street in @entity37 , west @entity22 , into a multi-storey ‘ shopping park ’			1
mrs @entity2 flatly refused to budge from the three - bedroom home she described as ‘ her castle ’ , resisting developers ’ generous offers and hiring a lawyer to fight her case			2
having persuaded all of mrs @entity2 ’s 11 neighbours to sell their homes , the developers eventually applied for a compulsory purchase order from @entity51			1
the order was granted and last friday a wrecking ball flattened her home in @entity55 to make way for a 25,000sq ft @entity8 , a 36,000sq ft @entity57 and a 550 - space car park			1

her sister , @entity24 said : ‘ she was very low on the day that they demolished her house			0

it would be disgraceful if all this has happened for nothing			0
