as @entity1 made his way off at the final whistle , two security guards hurried out of the tunnel and placed a shiny @entity5 on a plinth by the side of the pitch			2
the temptation for @entity11 ’s captain , after this dreamy individual performance , was to be done with it and raise the trophy aloft in front of 4,000 travelling supporters			2
@entity1 dragged the holders through , steering @entity11 in to the fifth round after this hard - working @entity20 team had twice threatened to make a real @entity5 tie of it			1
@entity11 ’s 34 - year - old midfielder had a cigar on out there , playing this fourth round tie as if it were an exhibition match			2
@entity29 ( right ) gave @entity11 the lead inside two minutes with a low strike beyond @entity20 goalkeeper @entity32 @entity29 watches on as @entity32 fails to stop his shot hitting the back of the net early on at the @entity36 @entity37 winger @entity29 ( centre ) celebrates his goal with team - mates @entity40 ( left ) and @entity42 defender @entity43 ( left ) gives @entity29 a hug after the former @entity46 man gave @entity11 the lead against @entity20 @entity20 : stockdale 5.5 ; @entity48 4 ( march 63 , 6 ) , @entity49 6 , @entity50 5 , @entity51 6.5 ; @entity52 6 , @entity53 6.5 , @entity54 7 , @entity55 7 ; @entity56 6.5 ( @entity57 81 , 6 ) ; @entity58 7			1

manager : @entity82 7 man of the match : @entity1 referee : @entity86 7 attendance : 30,278 * match ratings by @entity89 at the @entity36 ‘ if you love football , you love @entity1 , ’ purred @entity11 ’s manager @entity82 and he was right			2
some of his passing was from a future era			0
there were five goals at the @entity36 and it makes sense to start with the best			0
@entity1 , rightly , was responsible for it			0
before the 59th minute , when @entity1 scored their third , this had been a majestic run through of flicks , backheels and turns that you would expect to witness as part of a training ground warm down			0
instead the @entity11 captain was playing for real , starting the move for his volleyed goal with an unfathomable backheeled reverse pass into the feet of @entity74			1
it was a @entity113 ball with bells on , a glance one way to fool the opposition defence ( not difficult with @entity49 and @entity50 at the back ) and a pass in another direction			0
@entity74 , outstanding again up top for @entity11 , responded with a dinked chip into @entity1 ’s field of vision on the edge of the area and he volleyed spectacularly beyond @entity32			1
@entity1 was always one step ahead here , always a fraction quicker to the ball , always able to lift it over the outstretched legs of @entity55 , @entity54 , the @entity20 captain @entity49 or his central defensive partner @entity50			1
the challenge for @entity11 , after keeping @entity66 ’s team at arm ’s length down on the south coast , is to win this trophy for the sixth time in @entity82 ’s spell as manager			0
you can not put it past them , particularly after @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity46 and @entity147 all exited the competition on saturday			0
they are just two games away from another @entity152 semi-final			0
the scoreline suggests something a bit tighter , but truth be told @entity11 had slipped effortlessly through the gears in an impressive opening spell			0
@entity29 scored for the first time in a year , syncing up with @entity160 when the @entity11 right back burst down the right with just over a minute on the clock			1
@entity68 cut back for @entity29 and the @entity11 winger gained a yard or more on @entity165 before he drilled an effort beyond @entity167			1
they scored again when @entity1 drifted in from the left and allowed time and space to pick out @entity72 , unmarked , inside @entity20 ’s penalty area with his first reverse pass			1
midfielder @entity72 ( right ) turns and shoots to make it 2 - 0 while under pressure from @entity20 defender @entity50 @entity72 's goal was his first since returning from a serious knee injury sustained against @entity145 back in october last year @entity179 international @entity72 celebrates in reserved style as his fellow goalscorer @entity29 runs to congratulate him @entity74 ( left ) makes his way over to @entity72 and @entity29 after the @entity185 @entity184 star 's goal in the 24th minute @entity29 scored for @entity11 after a move down @entity20 's left side - click here for more in our @entity189 by the time @entity50 reacted , @entity72 had scored for the first time since his return from injury earlier this month			1
@entity1 had made it , though			0
to underscore the gulf in class there was a moment between @entity11 ’s opening two goals when @entity42 , @entity40 and @entity74 left @entity20 ’s players eating grass as they combed through their defence			1
beyond that @entity29 , who temporarily traded wings with @entity1 , could have had a penalty towards the end of the half when @entity48 raised his hands inside the area			1
for some reason referee @entity86 waved play on , something which became a feature of this @entity5 tie			0
the @entity36 , bursting at the seams with a record attendance of just over 30,000 , had fallen flat			0
those blue and white scarves needed a lift and they got it when @entity20 ’s journeyman forward @entity216 scored five minutes after the break			2
@entity11 failed to clear , with @entity70 ’s awkward , skied clearance making its way over the other side of the penalty area towards @entity68			0
the @entity11 defender failed to deal with it and @entity216 finished sweetly inside @entity67 ’s near post			2
@entity225 on , we thought			0
@entity11 midfielder @entity1 ( right ) smashes home his side 's third goal of the game with a brilliant volley former @entity231 goalkeeper @entity32 dived too late to keep out @entity1 's perfectly executed strike in the 59th minute @entity1 celebrates with @entity29 and @entity43 in front of the @entity235 ' travelling supporters at the @entity36 @entity20 striker @entity58 lashes the ball into the bottom corner to give the hosts some hope in the 50th minute @entity54 ( left ) celebrates with @entity58 as he runs back towards his own half to restart the @entity5 fourth round clash finally the @entity242 stirred , with those @entity20 fans belting out their @entity245 melody as they went after this @entity11 team			1
instead , @entity82 ’s team pulled clear again when @entity1 scored @entity11 ’s third with that volley in the 59th minute in front of their approving fans			1
to their credit @entity20 responded again , scoring for a second time when @entity55 combined with @entity53 to clip his effort beyond the onrushing figure of @entity67 in the 75th minute			1
@entity82 sent for protection , bringing on @entity71 to stretch the @entity20 defence ( again , never difficult ) and adding @entity73 to screening duties in front of @entity11 ’s back four			2
they survived when @entity68 handled , but it was inconceivable for the defender to move his left hand out of the way when @entity265 kicked the ball straight at him			0
the tie was still well within @entity11 ’s grasp and with a little help from @entity1 , they ran down the clock and made sure they are in the draw for the fifth round			2
crazy as it seems but he has only won the @entity5 once since his move to the @entity276 in 2006 , but @entity11 are favourites to retain the @entity5 now			0
after this , the stand - in skipper deserves to get his hands on another @entity20 forward @entity55 chips the ball over @entity11 keeper @entity67 to make it 3 - 2 in the 75th minute @entity55 ( right ) raises his arm in celebration after giving @entity20 hope of a late comeback against the @entity235 @entity40 holds off @entity54 as he plays a pass towards team - mate @entity69 at the @entity36 @entity20 midfielder @entity286 smashes a left - footed shot towards @entity67 's goal during the first half @entity20 defender @entity51 ( left ) , who is on loan from @entity291 , slides in to win the ball from @entity29			1

@entity29 gave @entity11 the lead inside two minutes with a low strike beyond @entity32
@entity72 *doubled* the @entity235 ' *advantage* on 24 minutes after a clever pass from @entity1
@entity58 pulled a goal back for @entity20 following some poor defending by @entity160
@entity1 restored @entity11 's two - goal lead with a fine volley after *exchanging* passes with @entity74
@entity55 gave the hosts hope again when he beat @entity67 with 15 minutes left on the clock
