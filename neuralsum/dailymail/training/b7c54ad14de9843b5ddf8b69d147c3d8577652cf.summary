by @entity0 a tv commercial for a burger has been banned because it encouraged unhealthy eating habits in move that could force food giants to radically change marketing tactics			2
the decision was made because the burger was given to a child who was seen removing the salad before tucking in			1
parents complained that it is difficult enough already to get youngsters to eat healthy salad and greens without a prime time tv commercial suggesting it is okay to push them to the side of the plate			1
@entity20 : an image from the @entity23 advert which has sparked outrage as the child is seen removing salad the commercial for the @entity23 supermarket chain was in breach of a rarely used section of an industry code which states advertisers ‘ must not disparage good dietary practice ’			1
campaigners welcomed the ruling announced today by the @entity35 ( @entity35 ) and called on it take a much tougher stand on the advertising of foods , particularly those loved by children			2
the complaints centred on a tv commercial for @entity45 ’s fourth largest supermarket and featured the chain ’s 100per cent @entity45 beef burgers which were being given to a little girl as a reward			2
the @entity35 said : ‘ a tv ad showed a mother preparing a burger for her daughter , who was talking about her day at school			2
‘ the mother stacked lettuce , tomato and onion on top of the burger and sealed it with the top of the bun			2
she then passed it to her daughter , who had just said ‘ my teacher said i was the best in the whole class ’			0
’ struggle : parents have berated the advert claiming it is already difficult trying to get their children to eat healthily without adverts telling them not to however , it said the girl removed the lettuce , tomato and onion from the bun , putting it on the side of her plate , before smiling broadly as she prepared to take a bite			1
a voice over then stated ‘ @entity82 quarter - pounders			0
love them cheaper ’ over an image of burgers being cooked			0
before being screened the commercial was vetted and approved by the industry body @entity84 , which thought the images and message were entirely harmless			0
it argued that while the girl did take the salad items out of the bun , she ‘ did not look disdainfully at the salad items or make a face that implied she did not like them or would not eat them in the future ’			1
@entity84 said the salad was not thrown away and the girl made no attempt to hide it			2
it suggested the girl had simply taken it out to make eating the burger easier and might , possibly , have eaten it later			2
however , this failed to convince the watchdog			0
it argued that the message given was that the daughter was so eager to eat the burger on its own that she immediately removed the salad , so ‘ choosing the option with less nutritional value ’			1
the @entity35 said : ‘ we noted the girl grabbed all the salad in her hand and dropped it on the side in a careless manner , before placing her hands around the bun , ready to eat and smiling , which we considered suggested she was not going to eat the salad later			1
‘ because we considered the ad placed an emphasis on the burger being the preferable option to the salad , we concluded it condoned poor nutritional habits or an unhealthy lifestyle , especially in children , and that it disparaged good dietary practice			1
’ this rule is very rarely used			0
the last time the @entity35 acted against an advertiser promoting unhealthy foods was in 2012 and involved the @entity128 sweet company			0
at that time it banned a ‘ @entity131 ’ online game for irresponsibly encouraging poor nutritional habits and unhealthy lifestyles in children			0
the use of popular cartoon character , @entity137 , on another section of the website , was also banned			0
@entity140 has been putting pressure on the @entity35 to take a much firmer line on the advertising of foods high in sugar , fat and salt to children			0
campaign co-ordinator , @entity149 welcomed the ruling , saying : ‘ it is one of the first occasions we have seen the @entity35 willing to uphold a complaint for an advert condoning or encouraging poor nutritional habits or an unhealthy lifestyle in children			1
claims : @entity23 insists it has made huge efforts to encourage healthy eating with its own - label food ‘ we hope this is the shape of things to come , with the @entity35 taking a more pro-active approach to protecting children from the mass of high fat , salt , sugar foods marketed at them and encourage healthier eating			1
‘ however , one swallow – in this case an upheld complaint – does not make a summer			0
the wording of the advertising codes is vague and inconsistent ; the rules for non-broadcast advertising are weaker than for tv and contain many loopholes for companies to exploit ; and the complaints process can be hard to navigate and is still too often stacked in favour of the food industry			0
‘ the @entity35 , the government , retailers and manufacturers still have a long way to go properly tackle the obesogenic environment that is helping to make our children ill. ’ @entity23 insisted it has made huge efforts to encourage healthy eating in children , by , for example , improving the recipes of its own - label food			1
it said the commercial was simply a fun representation of the problems that parents have in getting youngsters to eat well			1
a spokesman said : ‘ trying to convince children to eat their fruit and vegetables is something that most parents will identify with			1
our aim with the ad was to reflect this in a humorous and engaging way			0
we ’re disappointed with the @entity35 ’s adjudication			0
