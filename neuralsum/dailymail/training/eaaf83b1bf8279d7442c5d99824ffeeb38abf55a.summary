by @entity0 published : 06:15 est , 23 july 2012 updated : 17:07 est , 23 july 2012 situated in a desirable village and with a large garden and four bedrooms , it would appear an ideal family home			1
but @entity7 and @entity8 have encountered a distinct lack of interest in their property – after five separate out - of - control cars demolished their front garden wall since the property went on the market two years ago			1
the newly retired couple say their house and the stretch of road it lies on have become notorious as an accident black - spot			2
they are lobbying the local council to resurface the road in an attempt to improve drivers ’ grip and prevent further accidents			2
frustrated : @entity30 , 66 , had to repeatedly rebuild his garden wall after five drivers crashed into it in two years			1
his home sits 75 yards from the apex of a sharp bend in the village which is a notorious blackspot although the @entity41 live on a 30mph stretch of road , their home is close to a sharp bend which continually catches drivers out , especially in wet conditions			2
the couple have knocked £ 75,000 off the original £ 350,000 asking price to spark interest in the property , so far to no avail			1
mr @entity30 , 66 , and his 72 - year - old wife said the string of accidents – which included two within a few weeks last august , requiring their garden wall to be rebuilt each time – has cost their insurers £ 15,000			1
mr @entity30 , a former shipbuilder , said he had counted 16 accidents on the road since a car ploughed into the wall outside their home in @entity67 , near @entity68 , @entity69 , in september 2010			1
number one : the first car that smashed into @entity7 's property on the 29th september , 2010 leaving bricks strewn everywhere			0
it happened just months after the couple put their £ 350,000 home on the market number two : the second car that smashed into @entity7 's property on the 4th april , 2011 is pictured dangerously close to the house			1
the accident happened at night and house - buyers have been put off buying the property he said : ‘ it is only a matter of time before someone gets really seriously hurt or killed			0
‘ it would appear the road surface has become so worn that as soon as it starts to rain the grip level of the surface decreases dramatically			0
‘ there will be an accident here where a child gets killed			0
that ’s my big fear			0
‘ i ca n’t sleep at night because every time i hear tyres screeching i am just waiting for the inevitable smash of my wall			2
’ the couple put the property , where they have lived for 18 years , on the market in may 2010			0
but they were forced to take it off four months later following the crash on september 29 , so the wall could be repaired			2
number three : the third car that smashed into @entity7 's property on the 4th august , 2011			0
mr @entity30 and his wife say they ca n't sleep and are afraid there could be a fatality if nothing is done to improve the road 's grip number four : the fourth car that smashed into @entity7 's property on the 26th august , 2011			1
mr @entity30 has had to drop the price of his house by £ 75,000 but it remains unsold due to the problems with the crashes number five : the fifth car that smashed into @entity7 's property on the 4th july , 2012 completely destroys the wall			1
it was driven by a middle - aged driver who lost control of his red @entity135 and careered into the driveway the couple put the house on the market again in november but withdrew it after a crash on april 4 , 2011			0
builders had to repair the couple ’s wall twice in one month after a car crashed through it on august 4 and another car hit it on august 26			1
the latest crash took place on the evening of july 4 this year			0
@entity148 denied the road surface was responsible for the accidents			2
spokesman @entity151 said : ‘ the carriageway surface was inspected last year by a highways team and no issues were found			0
however , in light of concerns raised , we will inspect the area again			0

@entity30 even had to *re-build* his garden wall twice in one month
accidents have cost his insurers £ 15,000 and he fears a fatality is next
mr @entity30 has had to slash the asking price of his home by £ 75,000
