doctors are yet to confirm the cause of his death but believe he may have had a rare reaction to the usually - treatable @entity31			1
many children become infected with the virus but these infections usually cause no symptoms or are indistinguishable from other brief childhood illnesses			0
but in rare cases it can cause complications such as swelling of the brain and heart and problems with the nervous system			0
when doctors told @entity1 ’s parents @entity47 and @entity48 that their son was not going to survive they made the decision that his death should not be in vain and that @entity1 would donate some of his organs for transplant			1
mr @entity1 , a 38 - year - old financial adviser from @entity54 , said : ‘ when the medics were trying to save @entity1 ’s life i asked a doctor what his chances were of surviving and he said we were looking at the worst - case scenario			1
‘ it ’s a scenario which no parent wants to be faced with , but it was at that stage that we discussed organ donation			0
@entity1 was taken by ambulance from @entity68 ( pictured ) to @entity69 , where doctors battled in vain to save his life ‘ we mentioned to the ward matron that we would like him considered for donation because we wanted something positive to come out of this			1
‘ we send @entity1 ’s organs with love to all these people , especially to the little girl who they told us was just days away from dying			1

the funeral of @entity1 , who also leaves a brother @entity120 , two , took place yesterday			2
because the death of a child is often not foreseen , many families do not consider the possibility of organ donation			2

@entity139 , eight , and 14 - year - old @entity140 were gunned down by @entity141 , 36 , in @entity142			1
