by @entity0 published : 08:00 est , 3 february 2014 @entity2 : 08:02 est , 3 february 2014 low gravity could prevent the growth and spread of thyroid cancer cells , scientists claim			1
experimental biologists have studied the spread of the disease using a ‘ vomit comet ’ – an airplane used to simulate microgravity and train astronauts			1
@entity16 researchers subjected thyroid cancer cell cultures to 22 seconds of simulated microgravity using a parabolic flight and found that genes and proteins behaved differently			1
@entity16 scinetists discovered that genes and proteins involved in malignant cell growth , changed in behaviour in microgravity conditions to become less aggressive that they would have been on @entity27			1
a stock picture of magnified cancerous cells from the thyroid are shown cells in the human body normally grow within support structures made up of proteins and carbohydrates , which is how organs and tumours maintain their three - dimensional shapes			2
in lab settings , however , cells grow flat , spreading out in sheets			0
because they do n't duplicate the shapes they normally would make in the body , they do n't behave the way they would in the body , either , which poses problems for scientists who study cancer by examining genetic changes affecting cell growth and development			1
but in space , cells outside a living organism can still form three - dimensional groupings , or aggregates , that resemble what they look like inside the body			0
source : @entity65 scientists from the @entity67 , @entity68 ( @entity69 ) , compared the results of the cancer cells to some that had spent 10 days aboard @entity76 ’s @entity75 spacecraft in 2011			1
they discovered that genes and proteins involved in malignant cell growth become less aggressive that they would have been on @entity27 , @entity77 reported			1
‘ gravity can lead to changes in cell proliferation , differentiation , signalling , and gene expression , ’ they wrote in the study published in in the @entity82 ( @entity83			1
‘ at first glance , gravitational forces seem too small to affect bodies with the size of a cell			0
thus , the initial response to gravity is both puzzling and important for understanding physiological changes in space			0
‘ this also offers a unique environment to study the mechanical response of cells , ’ they added			0
experimental biologists have studied the spread of throid cancer using a ' vomit comet ' ¿ an airplane used to simulate microgravity and train astronauts ( pictured ) while the scientists stopped short of recommending trips into space for cancer sufferers in their study , they think research into how the disease reacts in microgravity environments could unlock secrets of cells ’ behaviour and ultimately lead to better treatments			1
thyroid cancer is the 20th most common cancer in the @entity124 , accounting for almost 1 per cent of all new cases , according to @entity127 ’s 2010 statistics			1
the @entity128 reported there were 60,220 new cases of thyroid cancer in the @entity132 in 2013 and over half - a - million people living with the disease in the country			1
@entity65 explained that space provides ideal conditions for studying cancer cells , as cells in the human body normally grow within support structures made up of proteins and carbohydrates , which is how organs and tumours maintain their three - dimensional shapes			2
in lab settings however , cells grow flat and spread out in sheets			0
because they do n't duplicate the shapes they make in the body , they do n't behave in the same way either , which poses problems for scientists trying to unlock their secrets			0
the aircraft gives its occupants and experiments the effects of weightlessness by following an elliptic flight path relative to the centre of the @entity27			0
the aircraft ( pictured ) and its contents are in free fall at certain points of its flight path however , in space , cells outside a living organism can still form three - dimensional groupings that resemble what they look like inside the body and scientists have been studying the effect of gravity on cells in microgravity conditions since the 1970s			2
experiments on the space shuttles and the space station have shown changes in immune cells , including changes in cell - signaling cytokines , ( small proteins secreted to mediate immunity and inflammation )			2
the research indicates that the immune system is suppressed in microgravity			0
the architecture of cells changes in microgravity , with changes to cell walls , internal organisation and even their basic shapes			0
a series of experiments aboard the @entity205 examined changes to human colon , ovarian and other cancer cells			0
in one investigation , reduced production of cytokines in a human @entity213 ovarian tumour cell line were observed			0
understanding changes in production of these proteins could help researchers comprehend the mechanisms of tumour cell development , @entity65 ’s scientists said .			2
