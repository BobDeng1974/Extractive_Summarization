@entity0 and @entity1 have two of the most talented , and expensively assembled , teams in world football			1
but who would make a combined xi out of the two squads based , not on reputation , but on current form ? allow me to get ahead of the fury of the comments section			1
if you 're @entity14 do you pick @entity15 ? of course you do			2
@entity15 may be the @entity16 , but on current form he does n't make combined xi our combined xi , which has no place for @entity15 , but does feature some of the world 's best players @entity15 has n't scored a league goal from open play in a month , and @entity24 is preferred on the wing did @entity15 have a brilliant first four months of the season ? of course he did ? might he score the winner on sunday ? quite possibly			1
does he deserve to be in a combined xi based on current form			0
no. goalkeeper - @entity29 there are four to choose from			0
@entity32 has barely played and @entity33 continues make mistakes in big games – @entity36 , @entity37 - so that leaves the two @entity1 goalkeepers			2
@entity39 is the league keeper but every time @entity29 plays he impresses and he ’s fresh from a penalty save in midweek			0
@entity29 has not played in the league this season , but he has earned his chance this week right back - @entity45 it ’s a close call between @entity45 and @entity47 but the @entity49 shades it after an aggressive , positive performance in midweek and because for all his much - debated defensive shortcomings @entity47 has actually shown many of the same deficiencies of late			0
@entity45 put in a strong performance against @entity55 , and just shades @entity0 's @entity47 centre back - @entity56 one of the best defenders in @entity58 this season – so much for the poster boy with the pop star wife who was now more interested in playing poker and running his web business than playing football			2
no one has been better than @entity56 , not at @entity1 , not in @entity65 , not anywhere			2
@entity56 , @entity58 's best defender this season , stops @entity68 in the @entity69 centre back - @entity70 he gets in just ahead of @entity72 courtesy of the @entity74 defender having only just come back from injury			0
@entity70 has held together @entity0 ’s defence in his partner ’s absence and is playing like a man who wants and will probably be given a new contract			0
has shown why @entity81 wanted him at the start of the season			0
@entity85 centre back @entity70 has been in excellent form in recent weeks , holding the @entity0 defence together @entity72 ( left ) has returned to fitness , and should start on sunday , but @entity70 just pips him in our team left back - @entity91 a very close call between @entity91 and @entity93			1
@entity94 is the fastest full - back in football			0
the only defender quicker than @entity98 and he showed it on wednesday			0
@entity93 offers @entity0 so much going forward and has improved defensively but @entity94 shades it			0
@entity91 proved against @entity98 that he is the fastest full back in the world , and he makes the xi @entity0 's left back @entity93 has improved his game , and offers plenty going forward , but just misses out right midfield - @entity105 scored against @entity55 and in the league against @entity107 two weeks before			1
the @entity108 is starting to show the sort of form that made him one of @entity65 ’s best midfielders last season			0
@entity105 has been a top performer for @entity1 recently , including his well - taken goal in midweek centre midfield - @entity115 it was bad luck for @entity55 that when injury hit @entity1 before the midweek second leg it probably made them even stronger			2
@entity120 is perhaps the second best holding midfielder in the world , @entity115 , who as @entity122 well knows ( after getting slightly carried away and selecting him as the world 's best player in the @entity126 vote ) , is the best			0
the injury to @entity120 has allowed @entity115 ( left ) to prove again that he is the world 's best left midfield - @entity129 he is not the complete midfielder that many @entity0 supporters seem to believe he is but all the same he is in very special form at the moment and in this team he can play alongside @entity136 , who famously has a dog named after			1
@entity129 is in a rich vein of form for the @entity141 champions recently , and can thrive in a number of positions right forward - @entity136 does there need to be an explanation here ? @entity136 mesmorised @entity55 in midweek with a performance for the ages at the @entity149 @entity136 is currently the best player in the world , on form , and possibly even the greatest of all time centre - forward - @entity153 selecting between @entity153 and @entity154 was one of the toughest choices but in this combined super-team you have @entity136 dropping into midfield so the battering ram that is @entity153 gets in ahead of him			1
@entity153 just edges in ahead of @entity154 to allow for his combination with @entity136 up front left forward - @entity24 it has to be @entity24 or @entity15 or @entity163 so what can you do ? @entity163 and @entity15 both went off in a huff in their last league games , @entity24 scored twice to silence some of the disproportionate criticism he has been on the end off			1
put @entity24 back on the left where he can whip the ball on his favoured foot or just do as he did last season against @entity1 in the @entity175 final and power so far in front of his marker that he can still cut inside and shoot			1
there is also only one player who has scored with a direct free - kick for @entity0 this season ... and it is n’t ronaldo it ’s @entity24			1
total : @entity1 8 @entity0 3 @entity24 gets in ahead of @entity15 after his two goals , complete with great celebration , against @entity187 @entity24 can have a real impact if he is moved back to the left hand side , and starts up front in our team			1

@entity0 travel to the @entity149 to face @entity1 on sunday
@entity1 are top of the league , one point ahead of their great rivals
@entity15 is out of form this year , so misses out on @entity201 team
but @entity136 , @entity24 and @entity153 make up *formidable* front three
