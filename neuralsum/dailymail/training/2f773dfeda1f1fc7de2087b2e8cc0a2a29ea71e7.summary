@entity2 fled his native @entity7 at the age of 12 and won asylum in 1982 after his mp and a local newspaper campaigned for him to stay			1
he claimed at the time he would get ‘ a bullet in the head ’ in @entity7			2
‘ i am terrified of going back			0
i will fight this all the way , ’ he said			0
‘ they will have to handcuff me and drag me to the aircraft			0

in april 2005 , he sold his firm , @entity31 , for £ 8.5million			2
but he was determined to avoid paying a 10 per cent tax on capital gains , equal to around £ 850,000			1
he might have deemed it a small price to pay for his new life			0
instead , the 54 - year - old has waged a long legal battle against accountants @entity39 – for failing to get him out of the tax bill			1
he tried to throw the blame on to @entity43 , a close friend who started working as his accountant as his fashion business grew			0
mr @entity43 , 68 , worked for @entity39 until his recent retirement			0
the @entity47 initially ruled in favour of @entity49 , awarding him more than £ 1million in june last year			0
judge @entity50 said mr @entity43 was ‘ honest , decent and competent ’ , but should have advised @entity49 to take specialist tax advice because he is not domiciled in @entity4			1
this means different rules apply to his assets			0
the judge ’s ruling caused controversy because it seemed to say that accountants have a duty to help their wealthy clients avoid tax			1

if something sounds too good to be true , it probably is			0
’ father - of - two @entity2 was born in @entity99 in 1959 and is a non-domicile , meaning that his official main residence is not in @entity4			1
when he sold his firm in 2005 , he paid £ 200,000 to enter an aggressive tax avoidance scheme recommended by an outside accountancy firm – not by respected @entity39			2
however , when this failed and he had to pay the tax and large amounts of interest , he sued @entity39 because , he said , they should have told him there were better schemes available to him			2
as a non-domicile , he could have avoided paying capital gains tax at all in a ‘ @entity115 ’ scheme			1
he will now have to repay the money he won from @entity39 as well as millions of pounds in legal fees			0
