in a bizarre twist of fate , @entity33 ’s great nephew was researching his family tree - and stumbled across a news release @entity26 had placed online , with @entity33 ’s name on it			0
@entity33 's family have since been handed the documents for the first time in an emotional meeting			2
@entity43 , 51 , began to search for his long - lost relative while caring for his sick grandfather , @entity44 - the surviving brother of @entity33			0
' after searching online , i found some information @entity26 had released about their discovery , for someone with the name private @entity8			1
' the information from the official records ties in with our family so we know it ’s definitely him			0
' although i ’m pleased to make the discovery , i ’m slightly tainted with sadness to think a relative of mine who was fighting for his country died at the young age of 21			2
' i would rather have him with us here today			0
' poignant : the @entity6 of private @entity8 , which was undiscovered for 67 years before being found last november the misplaced letter asks about the private effects and estate of @entity65 , who died aged 21 @entity43 has n’t told his grandfather about the discovery yet due to his health but plans to when his condition improves			1
@entity43 , from @entity71 , @entity72 , said : ' it will be an honour to pass these records on to @entity44 , especially after all these years			0
' i think it would be unsuitable to mention it yet , but as soon as he ’s back on his feet , i will give him the news			0
' i have told my mother , who was @entity8 ’s cousin , and she is pleased we have finally found the final piece of the jigsaw			2
' the paperwork was discovered by @entity85 , who works at the @entity26 depot in @entity87 , @entity72 , while she was cleaning out their packed lost property office			1
@entity85 , 43 , said : ' i found it while i was moving furniture around in the lost property office so it could be painted			1
documents : the @entity6 have now been returned to @entity65 's family after being unearthed last year ' i lifted a heavy cardboard box placed on top of an old metal cabinet and spotted the pristine paperwork perfectly preserved underneath			1
' i could n’t believe my eyes when i opened it and realised the dusty document was the signed last @entity6 of a 21 - year - old soldier			1
' it was sent by the @entity104 and was also accompanied by a formal typed letter to the soldiers ’ parents informing them of his death			0
' the tea - stained letter read : ' i am directed to enclose a certified true copy of a will executed by the late no. 4042611 private @entity114 of the @entity115 in which you are named as the executor			0
' it goes on to ask whether the soldier had any private estate and , if not , his @entity120 savings will be paid out in full to the family			2
@entity85 took it upon herself to discover the young soldier ’s true identity - and found that private @entity8 had tragically died on the bloody battle fields of @entity10 on august 27 , 1944			1
@entity26 worker @entity85 unearthed the letter from a lost property box and was ' almost moved to tears ' by its contents she said : ' it is heart - wrenching to think that this soldier 's poor family would never have received it and maybe got some comfort from it			1
' it was so nice to meet the family and put a face to who this soldier was			0
' it ’s been nearly a year since we tried to find private @entity8 ’s family - i was starting to think we would never find them			1
' the documents were still in their original envelopes unopened , so someone delivering it must have left it on a bus all those years ago			0
' my guess is that it was put to one side by someone in lost property and just got forgotten about as they expected someone to claim it			2
' the accompanying will signed by @entity8 states that he left his entire estate and all possessions to his mother , @entity169			0
official records showed that the soldier , who was from @entity172 , @entity72 , was buried in @entity173 in @entity10 , @entity174 , alongside 15 comrades			2
@entity85 said : ' the saddest thing is that the will is dated june 1944 and only a few months later he was dead with this letter informing his family			0
' it ’s been so nice to give something to private @entity8 ’s family that you can see means so much			1
' it was quite daunting holding on to something that is so crucial to a family , and i ’m so pleased that it is now in the hands of its rightful owners			0
' mr @entity43 does n't believe there to be any estate of any substance left by @entity65 , as he lived with his parents			0
mrs @entity65 died very soon after @entity65 's death , so mr @entity43 does not know whether or not any assets he had were passed on to her - despite the correspondence that never reached her .			2
