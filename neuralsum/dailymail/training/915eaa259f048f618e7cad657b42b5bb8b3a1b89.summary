this brings new weight to the term ' chasing rainbows ' , because chasing this colour spectrum would literally mean running in circles			2
during a recent trip over @entity8 in @entity9 , 46 - year - old aerial photographer @entity6 happened upon a rare natural phenomenon			1
' the pilot and i were on our way back from shooting a grand final @entity16 match in rural @entity17			2
it was raining softy , and the sun was peering through the clouds			0
' as we went through the trailing edge of the rain , the sun was low and setting and the sunlight just created this amazing rainbow			1
it just evolved in front of us			0
' stunning : 46 - year - old aerial photographer @entity6 happened upon the rare natural phenomenon on his way back from shooting an @entity16 match in rural @entity17 think quick : @entity6 took over 50 images for the five minutes it remained a complete full circle rainbow according to @entity35 , the full circle rainbow is ' an observer dependent phenomenon primarily caused by the internal reflection of sunlight by raindrops ' ' i had never heard of it before , not to mention seeing one in person			1
we looked at each other and said ' what the hell is that ? ' @entity6 says he trusted his instincts on how to capture the moment			1
' my experience with this sort of thing is to shoot first , then ask questions			0
i starting snapping like there was no tomorrow			0
' he took over 50 images for the five minutes it remained a complete full circle rainbow			1
' once we reached the beach , a big burst of light came through and the whole thing really lit up			0
then it faded as quickly as it came			0
' ' as soon as i got home , i started researching			0
basically it 's a very rare phenomenon that relies on specific conditions			1
' it needs to be low sun - so early mornings or evenings - and it has to be straight after a storm , with light coming through the rain			2
' when @entity77 uploaded the images online , they spread like wildfire			1
@entity6 received a spate of emails from scientists and astronomers who said they had ' never seen anything like it ' @entity6 ( right ) says he probably would n't attempt to find the circle ranbow a second time due to the exorbitant costs of aerial photography apart from getting media attention from all over the world , @entity6 was also contacted by a wealth of scientists and astronomers - including none other than @entity35			1
' i received a bunch of emails from people in those fields			0
they were so excited , they said they had never seen anything like it			0
' next thing i knew , i got an email from @entity35			1
they wanted to use my image for their @entity109			0
i thought ' why not ? '' according to @entity35 , the full circle rainbow is ' an observer dependent phenomenon primarily caused by the internal reflection of sunlight by raindrops			1
' when asked if thought he would try to chase the rainbow down a second time , @entity77 said ' in the end of the day , aerial photography is n't cheap			2
' it costs $ 1000 every time you want to get up there			0
with how rare these things are and how difficult it would be to replicate the moment , i 'm not sure if i could justify a second time			2
