a germ - killing robot designed to rid a room of dangerous viruses in minutes is being used to keep hospitals @entity4 - free			1
called ' @entity6 ' , the robot works by damaging viral dna using pulses of ultraviolet light			1
it is currently being used in 250 hospitals and health facilities across the @entity13 , including a @entity15 hospital where a patient with the first case of @entity4 diagnosed in @entity13 is being treated			1
it works by using pulses of xenon light to disinfect surfaces in five minutes			1
blasts of light are sent out in a 10ft ( three metre ) radius every 1.5 seconds			1
this can remove @entity4 from surfaces in a room in just two minutes @entity6 was created by @entity20 - based company @entity19			1
the robot rolls around on four wheels and uses xenon , a non-toxic gas , to create the ultraviolet rays needed to destroy viruses			2
@entity4 emerged in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks in @entity39 and near the @entity40 in the @entity41			2
there are several strains , which vary in how dangerous they are to humans , but death rates have reached as high as 90 per cent			0
in the current outbreak it is just over 50 per cent			0
the virus is introduced into humans through direct contact with the blood , organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals including fruit bats , which are eaten as a delicacy			0
symptoms include fever , intense weakness , muscle pain , headache and sore throat followed by vomiting , diarrhoea , rash , impaired kidney and liver function , and in some cases , both internal and external bleeding			0
people are infectious as long as their blood and bodily fluids contain the virus and the incubation period can range between two and 21 days			0
source : @entity75 it blasts 1.5 pulses per second up to ten feet ( three metres ) in every direction to kill viruses including @entity4			1
light that is 25,000 times bright than sunlight is created in each flash			0
the robot was first made available in 2010 and each unit costs £ 65,000 ( $ 104,000 )			1
' our robot ensures the room is safe for the next patient by destroying germs on high - touch surfaces , and in hard to clean nooks and crannies , ' a spokesperson for @entity19 said			1
@entity4 , however , is actually easier to kill than other infectious diseases such as superbugs that mutate and become immune to disinfection			2
it takes just two minutes for the robot to destroy @entity4 on a surface , while other viruses can be eradicated in five minutes			1
such technology , using uv rays to sterilise a room , has been around for decades , but @entity6 speeds up the process by using xenon in place of mercury			2
by comparison , a mercury - based uv machine takes up to an hour to disinfect a room			1
' our mission has always been to eliminate the pathogens that cause the infections that impact the health and lives of millions of patients and their families , and @entity4 is no different , ' @entity111 said in a statement			2
@entity6 costs £ 65,000 ( $ 104,000 ) and is already being used in 250 hospitals across the @entity13 to stop the spread of @entity4			1

the ebola virus ( transmission electron micrograph image shown ) spreads between humans through direct contact with blood , organs or other bodily fluids of infected people			0
although the disease has no cure , modern medical treatment and quick isolation help hugely to bring the death toll down			0
