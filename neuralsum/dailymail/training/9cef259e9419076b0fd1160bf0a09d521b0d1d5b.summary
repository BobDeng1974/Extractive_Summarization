by @entity0 famous composers including @entity2 and @entity3 have written music about clouds			0
but now clouds can create their own piece of music , with help from an @entity11 artist who has engineered a smart piano			1
musical compositions based on the density , speed and shape of the clouds are played on the hi - tech instrument , which relies on a robot to press down the keys			1
a piece of music is composed based on the density , speed and shape of the clouds and is then played on a grand piano which has been modified with mechanical parts ( pictured ) hooked up to a computer @entity29 is often inspired by the elements			1
he previously engineered works of art such as ‘ underwater ’			0
for that installation , he used a @entity36 sensor to collect data about the movements of a river , which was simulated on a grid of ropes including 486 servo motors , hung from the ceiling			0
the motors recreated the rippling motion of the river on the ropes , which when viewed from underneath , looked like the motion of the ocean			0
an art installation called @entity51 records the movement of clouds in the sky , which are then cut into 88 segments by a computer programme called @entity57 , @entity49 reported			1
the segments correspond to keys on the grand piano			2
the computer programme analyses the appearance of the clouds pictured in each of the pieces of the sky , artist @entity29 explained			1
this information is sent to a robot that plays the keys of a grand piano ‘ based on the movements and shapes of the clouds , ’ according to the artist 's blog			1
an art installation called @entity51 uses a camera ( pictured ) to take pictures of the sky			0
from this information , a discordant melody is created it does this by pressing the keys at different speeds and pressures			2
‘ if a dense cloud is detected , the key is pressed hard , ’ he told @entity49			0
‘ if it is a light cloud , the key is barely pressed at all			0
in this way , the intensity and speed at which the piano is played is determined by the intensity , speed , and shape of the clouds			2
’ according to the blog , ‘ the system is set in motion to function as if the clouds are pressing the keys on the piano as they move across the sky and change shape			2
‘ the resulting sound is generated from the unique key patterns created by ethereal forms that build , sweep , fluctuate and dissipate in the sky			0
’ the melodies created are largely discordant but are strangely calming , although a slight squeaking can be heard when the robotic ' fingers ' press piano keys			1
the images are cut into 88 segments ( pictured ) by a computer programme called @entity57 , which analyses the appearance of the clouds pictured in each of the pieces of the sky			1
they correspond to keys on the piano information about the cloud 's appearance is sent to a robotic device ( pictured ) that presses keys on the grand piano ' based on the movements and shapes of the clouds '			1
this means that dense clouds are played loudly and light clouds are quiet @entity51 will go on show at a gallery in @entity137 , @entity138 , next month			1
it is not his first kinetic , robotic work to be exhibited in a gallery , as mr @entity29 is well known for engineering works of art such as ‘ underwater ’			2
for that installation , he used a @entity36 sensor to collect data about the movements of a river , which was simulated on a grid of ropes including 486 servo motors , hung from the ceiling			0
the motors recreated the rippling motion of the river on the ropes , which when viewed from underneath , looked like the motion of the ocean .			0

music is composed based on the density , speed and shape of the clouds
piece is then played by a robotic device *attached* to a grand piano
the instrument was created by @entity11 artist @entity29
image of clouds is cut into sections by a computer programme and information about their movement and composition is analysed
from this , the robot knows how hard to press the piano keys and how fast to play a melody , based on the clouds ' movement across the sky
instrument will be on show in an art gallery in @entity137 , @entity138
