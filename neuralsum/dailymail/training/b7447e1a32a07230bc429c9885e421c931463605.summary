by @entity0 , @entity1 many women worry about feminine hygiene			1
but , in recent years , i 've noticed that more and more of my female patients are coming in and asking if they should be using a special spray or wash to help			1
such products have been around for a long time , but a recent survey by @entity10 market research firm @entity9 found that a quarter of women aged 16 or over had used feminine wipes and / or a feminine wash in the past six months			1
take a look on the shelves of any @entity18 pharmacy and you 'll see products such as @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23			2
the vagina is a perfectly - balanced ecosystem , and the bacteria there play a crucial role , says dr @entity29 these should not be confused with medical products that treat conditions such as thrush and bacterial vaginosis			1
instead , they promise to keep you ' fresh '			0
however , fragrant though they sound , i 'm afraid these products are completely unnecessary and , in my opinion , are exploiting women 's anxieties about their bodies			1
the advertising and packaging of feminine hygiene products play on the impression that women need to be squeaky - clean - otherwise they 'll be more at risk of infection			1
in fact , the opposite is true			0
the vagina is a perfectly - balanced ecosystem , and the bacteria there play a crucial role in gynaecological health			0
the skin cells of the vagina contain high levels of sugar molecules called glycogen , which bacteria break down to produce lactic acid			0
this helps to keep the vagina at the specific , acidic ph range it needs to keep itself clean and healthy , which is about 3.5 to 4.5 - about the same as a tomato ( the rest of your skin has a ph of about 5 to 6 , similar to rainwater )			0
the best thing you can do is to not interfere with this process			0
often , any odour is imagined but , of course , that 's not always the case			2
up to one in six women will be affected by bacterial vaginosis at some point , where the balance of the bacteria in the vagina become disrupted			2
it 's usually symptomless and clears on its own , but if it does cause symptoms - such as odour - the condition can be treated with a straightforward course of antibiotics			2
you can see why women might want to mask the odour - but , actually , that 's the worst thing you can do			2
in his view , ' these new feminine hygiene products just worsen women 's anxiety about their bodies ' studies show women who use scented soaps , bubble baths , or special deodorants , or who douche , are in fact more prone to bacterial vaginosis than others , as these practices can remove naturally protective bacteria			1
the new wave of feminine hygiene products are not designed to be used internally , so i would n't be concerned they could cause bacterial vaginosis			1
however , they do claim to be formulated to ' maintain ' or ' support ' a healthy vaginal ph - and this is misleading			0
as they do n't get anywhere near the inside , i do n't see how they could have any effect on the @entity131 there will be no difference in the ph of a woman using such products and a woman who washes with a normal shower gel - except that one will be lighter of pocket			0
in my view , these new feminine hygiene products just worsen women 's anxiety about their bodies , and are probably a waste of money			1
if a patient of mine is healthy , yet feels paranoid about a smell , i do n't have a problem with her using one - and the act of buying and using it may have a placebo effect , making her feel better about herself			0
but i would not recommend such a product and i always tell women to be a bit careful , as they could have a sensitivity to the ingredients , or even an allergic reaction			0
many feminine hygiene products are marketed as being ' free of preservatives ' , but it 's not possible to guarantee against allergy , as we can not predict what people may be sensitive to			1
over millions of years , this part of the body has adapted its own highly - effective cleaning process			0
as long as you 're showering every day and wearing clean , preferably non-synthetic underwear , this should be enough			0
dr @entity29 is a consultant gynaecologist at @entity170 , in @entity171			1

dr @entity29 says more women are asking about feminine hygiene
female patients want to know if they should use a special spray or wash
he thinks they worsen women 's anxiety and could be ' a waste of money '
and using such products could mean infections go *undiagnosed*
