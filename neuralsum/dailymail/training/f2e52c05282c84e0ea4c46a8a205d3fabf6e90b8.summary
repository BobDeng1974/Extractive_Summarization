@entity0 has said the downfall of her marriage , prompted by her husband 's affair , was that he was ' vulnerable ' to ' hopeful women ' her first husband cheated on her then deserted her			1
but far from feeling bitter , as many women would , @entity0 insists she was partly at fault			1
the veteran politician also blames the split on women who ‘ pinioned ’ @entity12 , saying the philosophy professor succumbed to their charms because he was too ‘ vulnerable ’ to resist			1
@entity0 says her burgeoning career – she was a @entity16 shadow minister at the time – played a part in the collapse of the marriage and urges other women whose husbands leave them to look at themselves with a critical eye			1
she rejected 12 proposals before marrying sir @entity12 , once described as the most brilliant and most important @entity26 moral philosopher of his time , in 1955			1
they had a daughter in 1961 but ten years later he left her for @entity31 , the young wife of a fellow academic			0
she is said to have offered to sacrifice her career as a rising political star if he stayed but to no avail and their divorce was finalised in 1974			2
‘ he [ @entity12 ] was a wonderful man , a brilliant man but he was always a bit … vulnerable , put it that way , ’ said @entity0 , now 84 , yesterday			1
‘ and of course because he was rather good - looking as well as frighteningly clever , he was pinioned by quite a number of – i have to say – hopeful ladies			1
’ the @entity44 added : ‘ i ’d been brought up with the view that if you were going to get married , then you had to be faithful – and you only got divorced in the most extreme circumstances			2
’ her mother , the feminist author @entity48 , initially applauded her decision to marry @entity0 , telling her : ‘ of all the men you might have married , @entity12 obviously has far and away the best mind , and he is also the only one who is capable of putting you before himself			1
’ @entity0 was happy in her second marriage to @entity56 historian @entity55 , who died in 2003 – the same year as sir @entity12			1
but reflecting on what went wrong the first time , more than 40 years ago , she told the @entity59 she had stopped herself being consumed by anger by asking herself : ‘ if your spouse indicates that they feel the time has come to break up , what did i contribute to that ? ’ she said : ‘ you ’ve got to understand how it is that he – who you loved – decided to leave you			0
and if you do n’t begin to understand what you have contributed to it , your life will be destroyed by a sense of vengeance , anger , fury , injustice – and , you know , that ’s not the way to go			0
sir @entity12 left his politician wife for @entity31 ( pictured above , left following his divorce from @entity0 ) ‘ you ’ve got to come to terms with that single question – what did i contribute to this ? and only when you have the answer to that can you actually then seriously think about why you broke up			1
‘ you must n’t kid yourself that you ’re the one who ’s been badly treated – you just have to understand how it happened			0
’ many regarded @entity0 as the woman likely to become @entity26 's first female prime minister a former journalist before entering @entity96 in 1964 , @entity0 rose via the @entity98 in the early 1970s to become secretary of state for education and paymaster general – holding both positions at the same time – as the only woman in @entity102 ’s 1976 @entity98			2
many at the time regarded her , not @entity104 , as the politician most likely to become @entity26 ’s first woman prime minister			2
after losing her seat in 1979 , @entity0 left the @entity16 in 1981 as one of the ‘ @entity110 ’ who founded the @entity110 , before becoming a @entity113 peer in 1993			2
asked if she encountered sexism in @entity96 , or was patronised , she replied : ‘ it was more subtle than that			0
' it was much more being treated as though you were n’t worth listening to			0
‘ that was one of the real problems but , to be fair , people like , not just @entity104 , the usual example but @entity123 even earlier , were quite substantial figures and they stood up for what they believed in and argued the case			0
' they did not fit into the agreeable , supportive woman concept			0
it ’s about being taken seriously and not being treated as an ancillary figure			0
’ meanwhile , a film version of @entity0 ’ mother ’s 1933 book , @entity133 , opens this week			2
miss @entity48 , a pacifist and feminist , was inspired to write it by the deaths of her fiancé , brother and two closest male friends during the @entity141			0
it was adapted for @entity143 in 1979 .			0

@entity0 described former husband as ' brilliant ' and ' wonderful '
she and sir @entity12 divorced following his affair in 1971
the 84 - year - old veteran politician said her career played a part in their split
she also said the philosopher had been ' vulnerable ' to ' hopeful ladies '
