click here to see how @entity1 manged to find the net for their freak opener and all of the other stats that matter from @entity6 progress does n’t need to be pretty all the time			2
thanks to an untidy own goal @entity1 secured vital victory from the first game for two years in which meaningful tournament qualification points were fully expected – and , mercifully , delivered			2
@entity1 utterly bossed the 110th ranked team in the world and fully merited a more emphatic margin of success from their play that was pleasing on the eye for much of the action			0
but a clinical presence deserted the team , particularly @entity24 on his return to @entity6 , and @entity26 was grateful for an inside job			1
the errant leg of @entity29 proved to be the scrappy lock - breaker on 28 minutes			1
there has been plenty of praise from racking up a six game unbeaten run , finding a way to win friendlies and vastly superior displays			0
this was about precious points with the pressure turned on			0
all three were deservedly earned in a 13th game without defeat for the national team at the home of @entity110			0
the cranked up expectations did not persuade @entity26 to stand by the man with the greatest experience of big match demands			2
@entity55 , with only 25 minutes of club football since his substitution in @entity116 , started on the bench as @entity44 stepped in to skipper the side on his international return from injury			1
the @entity123 midfielder could not have complained			0
this was a typical @entity125 day from @entity44			0
he was the driving force , tempo setter and refused to accept the ball dropping into visiting possession , always scrapping successfully to win it back			0
that trademark work from @entity44 was just one aspect of @entity1 ’s play that ensured @entity38 were kept on the back foot virtually from pillar to post			1
he ’s no fan of pernickety @entity138 procedure when points are on the line , either , as demonstrated by his brief spat with the fourth official as a jersey change took a split second or two longer than he liked			0
echoes of ‘ @entity146 , @entity146 ’ were only ever heard at @entity6 at the @entity148 end			0
they were all round the stadium here as the seconds – slowly , obviously - ticked down on victory and the second half nerves were wiped away			0
@entity40 was also excellent on his return from an enforced absence and preferred to @entity51 on the left			0
the scoring hero from @entity159 , @entity160 , formed a three - pronged support act to @entity162 with @entity33 on the right flank and @entity24 in behind			1
@entity164 midfielder @entity33 pounces on the loose ball and puts the full forces of his right boot 's laces through it @entity33 's powerful shot is saved by the right arm of @entity60 ( left ) but bounces off the calf of @entity29 ( no 6 ) @entity38 's @entity173 ( left ) and @entity1 's @entity162 watch as the ball trickles over the line for 1 - 0 as if in slow motion the ball crosses the line at @entity6 as @entity162 ( left ) , lurking in the goal area , begins celebrations @entity1 celebrates the goal with @entity33 , although it was later confirmed to be an own goal @entity1 players crowd around @entity33 after they take the lead in their @entity186 @entity94 qualifying match all the early play was exclusively in the @entity38 half and it was the 15th minute before @entity39 ’s penalty box even saw the football in a visiting attack			1
the only imprint on the game made by sole striker @entity72 was on the thigh of @entity43			0
@entity72 , who plays in @entity195 for @entity196 , was fortunate not to see yellow for his recklessness			0
on the one occasion @entity42 lost his bearings with @entity72 , early in the second half , the striker skied his angled effort			0
indeed , @entity39 could have prepped for the contest by watching @entity203 in what amounted for action against @entity206 on thursday night			0
after a period of adjustment to the surprise of facing a back four , @entity1 started to drag @entity38 from their preferred posts midway through the first half			1
corners and crosses from both sides gave @entity60 woes and their disorganisation in the face of this onslaught told in the as the patience and probing produced the opening goal just before the half - hour			1
a handful for the @entity38 defence down the left , @entity223 's @entity40 ( right ) puts pressure on @entity70 ( left ) @entity1 fans were in fine voice at @entity6 , with many donning the customary tartan as their side took on @entity38 unsurprisingly , it was one of @entity40 ’s delightful deliveries that created the chaos and @entity60 could only force the ball out to the feet of @entity33 on the edge of the area			1
the @entity164 schemer scored a screamer in a 2 - 1 win in @entity241 a year ago , but this was a goal he looked reluctant to claim as his third @entity1 strike			1
that dubious honour landed with luckless @entity29			0
@entity60 found a touch to initially divert @entity33 ’s drive from goal but he pushed on to @entity29 and the ball dribbled over the line			1
@entity33 reacted as if he ’s caught the ghastly bug that now compels players not to celebrate a goal against their former employers			2
as relief rippled through the @entity6 stands at breaching the defensive blockade , the @entity255 were more than happy to make up for @entity33 ’s low key reaction			2
with a confidence - boosting lead , @entity1 ’s play found a flow and @entity26 loved what he saw			1
if only there was a goal at the end of the good work , he could have relaxed just a little			0
@entity55 ’s link play had teed up @entity45 in @entity159 and his touch and hold - up class were seen to great effect			0
@entity1 's @entity160 is brought down by @entity38 's @entity85 in a spirited affair in @entity272 @entity85 made no mistake if halting the progress of @entity45 was his objective with this sliding tackle a smart exchange with @entity33 smoothed @entity24 ’s passage through on the keeper but @entity60 sped out to smother the ball as the @entity282 attacker took a heavy touch			1
it was n’t the only time that @entity24 was unable to bring his scintillating early season form to the table but , as ever , his tireless work rate and determination never gave the @entity38 defenders any peace			1
@entity1 were ferocious in attacking the visitors from all angles before the break but the relentless approach failed to secure a second as a rasping @entity44 shot was deflected inches wide and @entity33 got wayward with two hits from distance			1
@entity32 made an interval switch , introducing @entity63 on the left in an effort to give @entity43 more to think about than his rampaging runs down the flank			0
however , @entity43 robbed the substitute to scamper towards setting up a golden chance for a @entity1 second on 62 minutes			1
he slipped @entity24 in behind the last line and while the movement was ace , the right foot shot made across goal made life too easy for @entity60 ’s considerable frame and the @entity315 man was denied once again by the big keeper			1
anya hurdles yet another sliding from @entity38 's defence , this time @entity319 @entity1 's @entity47 has a chance to make it 2 - 0 with eight minutes left on the clock but @entity60 is well positions to save @entity1 skipper @entity44 embaces @entity33 after they secured maximum points from their @entity186 clash with @entity38 @entity24 ’s frustrations continued			1
@entity45 and @entity55 combined , with the latter ’s creative back heel into the path of @entity24 setting up another sight of goal			1
as @entity60 braced himself for a test , @entity24 screwed a low shot well wide			1
@entity24 , with goals against @entity123 , @entity336 and @entity337 , made way for @entity46 with 10 minutes remaining			2
@entity38 ’s second half set - up was built to menace more on the break			2
their forays up the park fizzled out			0
@entity6 did gasp in horror as the ball dropped to @entity71 16 yards out on one such counter			2
the substitute ’s low dig was dire , five yards wide			1
@entity1 wanted a settling second but @entity47 was denied by a combination of @entity353 and keeper			2
and just to increase the nervous tension , the fourth official ’s hapless fiddling with the substitute board kept the celebrations on tap as @entity49 ’s late introduction was subject to delay			0
the @entity363 man coaxed a couple of free kicks out of the @entity367 referee and held up play long enough for there to be no further dramas			0
a win essential to establishing a foundation from which to launch a bid to beat off @entity374 and @entity375 for an automatic qualifying slot is in the books			2
now for @entity381 where a repeat of another 1 - 0 win from only seven months ago will do just fine .			2

@entity26 's @entity1 claimed their first win in @entity385 against @entity38
@entity1 took the lead with a 28th - minute own goal coming after @entity33 's drive was saved and deflected
@entity38 keeper @entity60 stopped @entity33 's strike but it bounce off @entity29 's leg and dribbled in
@entity44 had a chance to make it two but his side - footed shot from 15 yards was deflected wide
stand - in skipper @entity24 's heavy touch when one - on - one with @entity60 was a *squandered* chance
@entity162 's back - heel found @entity24 again but his shot from eight - yards went wide
@entity71 had @entity38 's best chance after 80 minutes but dragged his shot wide
@entity1 face @entity374 on *tuesday* in @entity381
