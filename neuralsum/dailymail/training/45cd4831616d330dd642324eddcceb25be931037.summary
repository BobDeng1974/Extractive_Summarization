by @entity0 the body of a woman whose daughter promised would be buried beside her late husband has been found four years later - mummified and decaying in her home in @entity6 , @entity7			1
@entity8 found her 98 - year - old mother @entity9 dead in her bed in september 2010 , and told her son that she would be buried in @entity12			1
but now her remains have been found still in that very same same bed , in what police have described as a rubbish - filled ' hoarder house ' on @entity17			1
@entity8 assumed the police would think @entity8 neglected her and that is why she died			2
' for this reason , she bizarrely decided to leave her mother where she had found her , and she remained there until police discovered her gripping an old blanket on june 28			0
they said it was obvious that she had been dead for a very long time			0
police made the gruesome discovery because ms @entity8 's ex-husband , @entity42 , had gained control of the house through the courts , after she had fallen behind on payments			2
acting as a court commissioner , a real estate agent went into the house to find it in awful condition			0
concerned , police searched the house to find it full of rubbish , with clothes stacked in piles in many of the rooms , and mrs @entity9 's remains in one of the bedrooms			1
they also found a pet bird , which was in healthy , cared - for condition			0
ms @entity8 's son @entity64 told police he had moved out of the house four years ago to go to university , and not long after had been told by his mother over the phone that his grandmother had died			1
he said he had not been to the house since , but had been told that his mother 's plan had been to bury mrs @entity9 next to her husband in @entity12			1
sgt. @entity73 told @entity74 that the @entity75 still has not officially identified the body , and the case is still an active death investigation			0
but it is expected the body will soon be announced as mrs @entity9 's			2
he added that there are currently no signs of fraud or any other criminal activity			0
police are also looking into the rough date of death , and also to see whether the body has suffered any broken bones or other damage .			0

@entity9 died aged 98 in her bed in september 2010
her daughter , @entity95 , planned to bury her with husband
but panicked at the state of her ' hoarder ' house and left her in bed
police investigating to see if there are any signs of *wrongdoing*
