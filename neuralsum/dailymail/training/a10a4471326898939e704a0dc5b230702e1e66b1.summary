given what @entity2 has coped with before , the fact he calls the @entity5 job his toughest to date speaks volumes			1
harder than lifting @entity7 from bottom of the @entity9 , six points adrift , to an 11th - placed finish in a limited time			1
harder than reshaping @entity13 from @entity14 also - rans to top - flight heavy hitters , because of expectations			2
‘ just because i ’ve walked in the door does n’t mean this club will stay up , ’ was his stark assessment			2
‘ i think complacency is one of the worst words in the dictionary			2
‘ a lot of those people who are saying it have n’t been involved in trying to do it			2
it ’s a compliment , brilliant , but i ’d rather have it at the end of the season			2
‘ there will be more pressure on the players to perform here than at @entity7			2
and it ’s such a short period			2
you have to give the chairman a lot of credit because he understands how serious the situation is			0
’ @entity2 takes charge of the @entity5 who sit 17th in the @entity9 with 18 points from 20 games currently prime among his tasks is energising the @entity61 , which has been febrile for some time off the back of just four league wins at home in 2014			1
he wants to act decisively in the transfer market and has identified targets to aid a team he watched earn a point at @entity70 on @entity71			1
‘ the one thing i said to them was at times i did n’t think they were positive enough , ’ @entity2 revealed			1
‘ there were times when we broke and had really good opportunities but instead of taking people on they were looking for that pass			0
’ @entity81 and @entity82 will be in the dug - out today for the visit of @entity84 in the @entity85 alongside @entity86 , brought in by @entity87 , who will watch from the stands			1
@entity2 ( left ) watched in the stands as @entity5 drew 1 - 1 away to @entity70 on @entity71 @entity91 striker @entity91 ( left ) could be sold this january transfer window depending on the offer @entity91 ( centre right ) scored @entity5 's equaliser against the @entity70 on @entity71 he is ready to work with technical director @entity96 to bring in players and will be supplied with funds by chairman @entity99			1
‘ i ’ve got one or two in mind who i think can help us but we ’re not down the line with any of them at this moment			0
it ’s a very busy month for coming and going			0
’ peace has previously said @entity91 , scorer of the equaliser at @entity110 , would not be going anywhere this month			0
however , @entity96 opened the door a little with @entity2 now on the scene			1
‘ @entity2 is a totally realistic manager , ’ said @entity96			1
‘ he will work whatever way is best for the club			0
he tries to win matches and if he needs to sell somebody to do something else he will sell			0
@entity91 is worth what some club would pay for him			0
’ even as things stand , @entity5 require a striker of substance , as well as pace and genuine width			1
@entity2 , 56 , insisted he was happy with the structure of @entity5 and his ‘ head coach ’ role - even if his style is very much as manager			1
@entity2 says he has spoken to his sacked predecessor @entity129 about life at @entity5 ‘ you can call me head bottle washer if you want , the title does n’t make a difference , ’ he said			1
‘ as long as i know there are specific areas i ’m in charge of			0
we have to be together to make sure the club stays up			0
‘ i worked with @entity142 at @entity13 for 10 years			0
he was director of football and was never a problem			0
i ’ve known @entity96 20 - odd years - i ’ve no problem			1
’ interestingly , @entity2 spoke to @entity129 after he was sacked to do his homework on the club			1
he also spoke to former head coach @entity146 and admitted comparisons were fair			0
‘ i think @entity146 likes being out working with players			0
we are @entity150 children brought up the right way ! ’ he said			0
‘ you have different principles and ideas on life			0
people talk about three games in six days , but you compare what people go through in life to the players and it is laughable			2
’ the hard work for @entity5 starts now .			1
