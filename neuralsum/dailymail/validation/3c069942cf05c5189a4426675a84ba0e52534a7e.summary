a woman with multiple sclerosis was forced to get out of her power wheelchair and carried on stage to speak at a disability conference			1
speaker @entity5 was hoisted out of her chair and escorted by two people up the four stairs between the floor and the raised stage			1
disability rights advocate @entity12 was at the @entity13 at @entity15 's @entity14 last thursday and was outraged by the oversight			1
speaker @entity5 , who has multiple sclerosis , was forced to get out of her wheelchair and carried by two people on and off the stage ' i thought ' they 're going to pull out a ramp , they obviously planned for this ' , ' she told @entity25			1
' no ramp was forthcoming so the next best thing is they are going to move the table and microphone so she can sit with everyone else , but they did n't do that			0
' they suggested she move out of her chair and be carried on by two people			2
' ms @entity36 - who is a wheelchair - user herself - said it was degrading to see a person in a wheelchair be treated like that			1
' it just removes your agency and your power to move around the world , ' she said			0
' it makes you dependent on someone to give assistance			0
to add further insult , chairs were stacked inside the disabled toilets , preventing people from using it ' it 's not the way you want to be able to be seen			1
it 's not an empowering way to enter a stage			0
' to add further insult , the disabled toilet at the venue had been stacked up with chairs , preventing people in wheelchairs who had to go to the bathroom from using it			1
ms @entity36 said disabled toilets were often seen as secondary storage spaces			1
' to use a toilet is quite crucial and a fundamental right that non-disabled people take for granted , ' she said			2
' it speaks volumes about the space the @entity13 was held in			2
' i mean we do n't even have the right to pee			0
' @entity77 , who is the disability discrimination commissioner at the @entity79 , said she had written to the organisers of the summit			0
disability rights advocate @entity12 was at the @entity13 in @entity15 and said it was a degrading sight to see the @entity14 in @entity15 has apologised for the incident , saying they ' fell short ' of delivering all their duties , and vowed a similar incident would not reoccur			1
' on behalf of @entity88 , i would like to apologise for the incident that took place at the @entity13			2
we fell short of delivering all of the necessary requirements and this is disappointing , ' @entity90 , general manager at @entity88 said			0
' at @entity88 , the comfort and safety of our guests is of paramount importance to us			0
whilst these are isolated incidents , it is nonetheless a lesson learnt			0
' we will ensure every effort is made to further improve the accessibility in our hotel premises , so that such incidents do not re-occur , ' mr @entity101 added			0
but this is not the first controversy the @entity13 has attracted			2
this year , only seven people with a disability were allowed to attend the two - day conference , causing a social media outrage			1
@entity25 has contacted the organisers and @entity14 for comment on the matter .			0
