@entity0 has a knack with strikers			1
it is widely regarded as the hardest part of the game – getting the ball over that painted white line between the goalposts and into the back of the net			0
it is why forwards are the most sought - after , expensive and adored assets in the game			2
@entity15 ( second left ) fires past @entity16 in the @entity18 goal for his first goal in a @entity21 shirt @entity22 ( second left ) grabs @entity23 in celebration after he pulled the @entity21 level at @entity26 's but @entity0 has a history of getting those who have recently signed for him ticking , and @entity15 was yet another example of that when he controlled a pass from @entity33 and finished over @entity18 goalkeeper @entity35 in @entity21 's @entity36 fourth - round win			1
@entity37 had not managed to draw a league goal from the player in his 18 months in north @entity40 , in 11 appearances			0
after signing @entity15 on loan @entity0 insisted that it was not necessarily goals that make a striker and that he can offer the ' chaos factor			1
' but @entity23 grabbed the no 9 shirt and was determined to prove what @entity37 claims to have seen in him			2
in only his second match , he was off the mark			2
at @entity53 , @entity0 had a similar effect on his new recruits			1
@entity56 scored on his debut against @entity58 after his £ 9million move from @entity60 in january of 2012			1
then netted against @entity61 two games later			2
by the end of the campaign he had played 14 games and scored 13 goals			2
@entity0 , pictured at @entity26 's on saturday , seems to have a knack of getting his strikers firing @entity23 and @entity33 ( left ) , both on loan at @entity21 , celebrate in front of their supporters @entity0 had a similar effect on @entity73 ( left ) and @entity56 ( right ) while at @entity53 @entity73 netted 17 in his first season at @entity53 following a move on a free from @entity76 – and he was supposed to have knees made of glass			1
when @entity0 took over at @entity18 in 2009 for his brief spell in charge he made @entity82 one of his first signings			1
the £ 1m man from @entity85 scored on his debut versus @entity87 , had three in his first three and an astounding 37 goals in 59 appearances that year			0
not that he is a new recruit , but @entity90 had two by half - time as @entity21 went 3 - 2 up against @entity18 his first appearance in six weeks and first under @entity0			1
as the half - time whistle blew , the travelling @entity21 supporters were singing their manager 's name : ' @entity97 , super , super @entity98 , super , super @entity98 , super @entity0			1
' by the final whistle , it was even louder			0
@entity23 gees up the @entity21 ' support after netting his first goal in a @entity21 shirt in the @entity36 fourth round @entity23 celebrates after scoring against @entity18 , as @entity21 overcame the @entity18 to progress in the @entity36 @entity23 could 've had more , too			1
his low shot which @entity35 fumbled led to @entity90 's first and he headed narrowly over the bar from a corner			0
@entity37 has compared him to @entity110			0
' up front it 's an instinctive job , ' he said			0
' experience helps a little bit			0
but the belief , the confidence , is more important up front than the experience			0
' when i started to play @entity110 , everybody said : “ why do you start @entity110 , why not buy a striker ? ” we won a championship with him			0
it 's just like that , if we feel they are ready then they play			0
; he was bought from @entity130 for £ 500,000 and sold on to @entity131 for £ 23m after two years			0
@entity23 has shown nothing to back that up at @entity134 , but he has not had the @entity0 effect – until now .			1

@entity0 's first signing as @entity21 manager was @entity15 on loan from @entity134 until the end of the season
in only his second match , @entity23 scored to help @entity21 to *victory*
@entity0 has a knack with strikers , in the past helping @entity56
@entity73 netted 17 in his first season at @entity53 after *injury* *worries*
@entity21 beat @entity18 3 - 2 to progress in the @entity36
