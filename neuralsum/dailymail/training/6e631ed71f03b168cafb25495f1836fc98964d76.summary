by @entity0 last updated at 9:11 am on 26th january 2012 guilty : @entity1 , 23 , fought @entity2 and bit off part of his ear a cousin of celebrity @entity2 winner @entity2 who bit off the ear of the reality star in a bare - knuckle street brawl has been jailed			1
@entity9 , 21 , sank his teeth into the @entity13 star 's ear during a fierce gypsy brawl outside a @entity15 in @entity16			1
the fight between @entity1 and 52 - year - old @entity2 was filmed on a mobile phone and loaded to @entity19 , showing the blood - splattered reality tv star grappling with his cousin in front of rush hour traffic			1
the ' revolting ' brawl in june last year had been sparked by a long - running family feud which saw @entity2 claim he had ' shunned ' by the gypsy community over his celebrity status			1
during the fight , @entity1 's brother @entity29 , 23 , was overheard baying for blood shouting : ' come you dirty @entity2 bast * * d , give it to him @entity9 , give to the dirty tramp , floor the dirty tramp			1
' celebrity big brother winner @entity2 later underwent surgery to have ear sewn back on			1
he himself admitted affray but was given a suspended jail term earlier this month			0
today @entity1 , of @entity42 also admitted affray but was jailed after @entity44 was told he had a history of violence			0
in sentencing @entity1 to 15 months jail , judge @entity47 condemned the ' revolting nature of this family feud '			1
scrap : footage of the fight shows @entity2 , right , grappling with his cousin @entity1 as the gypsy family 's feud boiled over in public shocking : the pair scrapped in broad daylight in front of stunned motorists outside the @entity15 in @entity16 bloodied : @entity2 after part of his ear was bitten off , in an image originally posted to his @entity67 page the judge added : ' whatever the right and wrong of this feud i have to pass sentence regardless of how this incident started			1
' i am prepared to accept that @entity2 may have made the first move but what happened thereafter was that the wrong doing was on the side of @entity9			1
' traffic was held up and members of the public were frightened and @entity2 received the worst injuries , he was bleeding from his face and his ear was badly bitten			2
it 's preposterous to say that this action resulted from self defence			0
' @entity9 has the worst record for violence and furthermore the probation officer recommends a custodial sentence with @entity9 having made it quite clear he was n't prepared to consider unpaid work			0
' @entity2 himself escaped jail when he was handed a 51 - week suspended sentence for the brawl earlier this month the fight was the latest round of a bloody feud between @entity2 and the @entity99 which was sparked by a row at a family funeral			1
in august 2010 a shooting took place at the home of @entity9 's mother after he handed himself in over an earlier bust up with @entity108 at his caravan site			2
then in february 2011 @entity9 was tried and acquitted of causing grievous boldly harm after claiming he acted in self defence			0
four months later @entity9 and 23 - year old @entity29 ran into @entity2 on busy @entity113 street in @entity16 while the tv star was out jogging and the @entity99 were shopping for a birthday present			1
@entity116 , mr @entity117 , said : ' there is and was at the relevant time bad blood between @entity2 on the one hand and @entity9 and @entity29 on the other			1

mr @entity139 added : ' he invited a fight and a fight is what he got			0
the fact that @entity2 received more serious injuries should n't be taken into account , that shows who were the stronger and more fortunate			0
' when one engages in a fight willingly or enters into it one is likely to be injured			0
the fact that he received more injuries than @entity9 is not something that should be held against @entity9 , when both men were prepared to fight each other			2
violence : @entity2 and his cousin were involved in a fight outside a pc world , similar to this one , in @entity16 ' mr @entity2 is a man who has previously made something of a career from himself as being a man who is prepared to use violence			2
' he had used that in the media to his advantage in the tv show @entity174 's @entity173			0
' he said : ‘ when i fight i would bite them , bite their ears , bite their noses and swallow it to permanently disfigure them , i would n't spit it out so it could n't be sewn back on '			0
' it 's as a result of that programme that his career as a celebrity started and he became a person with a certain notoriety in the gypsy community			0
' there has to be a point where these two parties stop acting in this way and i 'm told by @entity9 that this happens today			0
' @entity29 admitted using threatening behaviour and was given a 12 month community order			0
