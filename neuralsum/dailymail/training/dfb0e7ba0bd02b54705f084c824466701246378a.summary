in the day - to - day running of the country the governor - general acts as the country ’s head of state and is appointed by @entity3 on the advice of the @entity5 prime minister			0

he said it was ‘ for the people of @entity7 to decide ’ on the @entity3 ’s role			2
however , @entity91 , professor of constitutional law at @entity93 , said the @entity3 may need to change her role if the @entity15 split			0
he said : ‘ politically , the @entity3 could find herself in difficulties if she received contradictory advice on her royal duties or public utterances on matters of common interest , particularly in foreign or diplomatic matters , where the @entity15 and @entity7 governments might happen to be at loggerheads			2
