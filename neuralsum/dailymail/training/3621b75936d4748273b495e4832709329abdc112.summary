he bought the @entity13 last year with the intention of living upstairs while a friend ran a restaurant downstairs			1
but he wrote to neighbours saying the plan was not financially viable and he would convert the whole building into house			1
former regulars at the pub , in @entity4 , @entity23 , said the conversion would ruin the ‘ strong sense of community ’ on the street , while a local councillor called the move a ‘ tragic loss ’			1
mr @entity1 and his wife @entity31 , a designer , currently live in @entity32 and bought the property with the intention of moving when their three children – aged 15 , 13 and nine - finish school			1

the actor , who famously played @entity42 and @entity43 the slob , said : ‘ i have been a resident of @entity4 since 1988 , my family since 1929			1
’ if the council did not grant permission for the change of use to a home he would consider other options , he said , but warned ‘ every other option would take time and stretch us financially ’			0
he added : ‘ there are two other pubs within 50 yards , four other pubs within 150 yards and six other pubs within 300 yards , we would imagine the council might think the loss of this one not to be too great , the compensation being greater tranquillity			0
’ the pub ’s former landlord @entity61 , who ran it for 32 years before his retirement last year , expressed concern that mr @entity1 ’s plans would change the nature of the street			2
hub of the community : locals have said the permanent closure of the @entity73 1 pub in @entity4 is a ' tragic loss ' to the community he told a local newspaper : ‘ this is a great little street with a sense of community			1
people know each other and everyone would like it to remain a pub. it should not be changed into a house			2
it plays such an important role in the area			0
' where are people going to meet , socialise , hold their celebrations , their wakes ? @entity94 ’s ? @entity95 ? it was a good pub with a good clientele , and it was successful			0
’ the pub has been closed since mr @entity61 retired and local @entity100 said neighbours were hoping it would be reopened under mr @entity1 ’s ownership			0
new neighbours : @entity1 and his wife @entity31 hope to move into the property with their three children not so funny now : @entity1 pictured performing his @entity110 sketch on the tv show @entity1 and chums he said : ‘ since its closure there has been something of a sense of mourning , an unnerving silence and i am sure that i speak for many when i say that we long for some life on the corner			0
’ @entity4 @entity125 councillor @entity124 said : ‘ it is a tragic loss and people will be desperate to save it			2
’ the plans , filed last week , show the building currently has a beer basement , a kitchen and external store			0
the home upstairs , where the former landlord lived , can be reached by a separate entrance			0
the renovation would include creating a garden and extending the back of the building			0
