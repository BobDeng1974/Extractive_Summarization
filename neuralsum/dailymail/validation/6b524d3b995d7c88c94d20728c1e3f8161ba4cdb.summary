an unusual nexus of mining interests , relief work in @entity3 , and a former @entity5 first family is raising new ethics questions that could affect @entity8 's presidential ambitions			1
@entity10 's brother , @entity9 , was a board member of a @entity12 mining company that enjoyed prime access to @entity3 gold deposits in the wake of post-earthquake relief work organized in part by former president @entity10 through the @entity18			1
another board member of the firm , @entity20 , was former @entity3 prime minister @entity21 , who co-chaired the charitable @entity22 with mr. @entity10			1
the revelation , smacking of cronyism and back - room government dealing , is part of a forthcoming book by @entity30 founder @entity29 , whose work exposing the investment ' insider trading ' habits of members of @entity36 caused national outrage in 2011 even though the practice was legal			1
at the time @entity20 's ' gold exploitation permit ' was awarded , according to a press release from the company , it was one of only two firms to get one			2
the @entity3 government had n't issued such a permit in more than 50 years			1
@entity9 , brother of former secretary of state @entity8 , sat on the board of a company that landed a gold mining deal in @entity3 after @entity60 and @entity8 directed millions into post-earthquake relief @entity62 first reported on the investigative nonfiction book 's coming release			1
the january 2010 @entity3 earthquake killed more than 100,000 people and affected more than 3 million			2
that disaster was followed nine months later by a cholera epidemic of historic proportions			0
the @entity18 raised at least $ 36 million to help , according to its website			0
the @entity72 administration pledged $ 3.6 billion			0
' much of the @entity5 assistance is provided by the @entity74 , ' a department of the @entity75 that mrs. @entity8 led at the time , according to the department 's website			1
@entity9 's company got its gold mining rights in december 2012 , according to the @entity20 press release			1
@entity29 's publisher , @entity83 , said in a press release thursday that it ' reveals how the @entity85 went from " dead broke " on leaving the @entity86 to being millionaires , describing in detail the way in which the @entity85 habitually blur the lines between politics , philanthropy , and business			2
' the @entity85 ' family philanthropy came under fire in february for admitting it had accepted money directly from foreign governments including the @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101			0
some of those donations came while mrs. @entity8 was the @entity5 secretary of state			2
@entity103 reported that the terms of @entity9 's gold windfall upset members of @entity3 's senate : the government 's royalties under the deal were pegged at just 2.5 per cent , half the customary rate			1
and @entity20 mining has an option to renew the terms for 25 years			1
@entity83 executive editor @entity115 , son of the famed novelist @entity116 , said in a statement that in @entity29 's book , he ' coins a new term to describe the unique way in which @entity60 and @entity8 tend to mingle their political , personal and philanthropic interests			1
' he calls it ' the @entity125			0
' ' @entity29 ’s exhaustively researched book raises serious questions about the sources of the @entity85 ' sudden wealth , their ethical judgment , and @entity8 's fitness for high public office , ' @entity116 added			1
mrs. @entity8 was @entity5 's first lady and a @entity5 shuhenator before losing the @entity135 presidential nomination to @entity72 in 2008 and joining his administration the following year			2
in addition to howls from the political right about her foundation 's role in attracting donors from among countries with whom she negotiated – $ 500,000 of the @entity18 's @entity3 donations came from the @entity149 government , for example – she is under fire for using a private email address run on her own server , during her years at the @entity75			0
she never had a ' state.gov ' address			0
instead she ran her professional and personal emails through her own internet domain , ' @entity157 , ' creating ethical and possibly legal issues because of the possibility that the @entity75 has not archived all her messages			0
close : @entity10 greeted @entity3 president @entity161 warmly when she arrived for the indutrial ribbon cutting in 2012 @entity10 got an additional black eye this week with the revelation that @entity165 , who served as @entity5 's ambassador to @entity167 for 13 months of her tenure , was ousted after he did somethign similar			2
when @entity165 took over the @entity170 embassy , according to a 2012 inspector general report , he insisted on the installation of a private , commercial internet connection in the bathroom attached to his office so he could communicate with the outside world beyond the reach of the @entity75			0
the @entity179 requires employees of executive branch agencies to keep their emails and make them available for permanent retention			0
the law originally did not explicitly apply to electronic communications ; @entity36 updated it after mrs. @entity8 left her job as @entity5 's top diplomat			1
stories about government higher - ups using private email addresses for government work are nothing new			0
one @entity72 administration official , former @entity194 administrator @entity193 , used an email address with fictitious name attached – ' @entity197			0
' but @entity10 is widely expected to announce a run for the @entity86 next month , putting her conduct under an unforgiving microscope			0
members of @entity36 typically have private email addresses , something that 's not prohibited under federal law for officials in the government 's legislative branch			2
federal law does , however , prohibit them from using their taxpayer - funded ' mail.house.gov ' or ' senate.gov ' addresses for fundraising and other political activity .			0

book *due* out in may describes *alleged* *sweetheart* deal that netted @entity20 mining a gold *concession* that had n't been issued to anyone in 50 years
@entity9 , mrs. @entity8 's brother , sat on the company 's board
another board member co-chaired a relief effort with former president @entity10 following a *devastating* 2010 earthquake
' @entity44 ' is the latest from @entity29 , who turned heads in 2011 with an expose about insider trading by members of @entity36
