' she saw her mother murdered at the age of six , along with her three - year - old brother			1
' she was brought up by her grandparents and managed to find forgiveness for [ her mother 's ] murderer , her mum 's boyfriend			2

her visit resulted in a @entity58 documentary named @entity59 which shed light on the lives of the women working in @entity9 's brothels , the oldest of which has been in operation since 1902			1
' it was very challenging , ' says @entity11 of making the documentary , ' and i joke that i am sure i will end up having some serious therapy sessions about it one day			1
' i think [ visiting the brothels ] makes me realise how lucky i am and that i was dealt a good set of cards at the beginning of my life , which sadly is not the case for everyone			0
' it has also made me realise how amazing some of the women i have met inside the brothels are , who were dealt a bad set of cards at the beginning , and turned things around against all the odds			2

it 's compelling and made all the more so for the painterly quality of the image - an effect , says @entity11 , that she deliberately aimed to achieve			2
' i wanted to make them like the muses of @entity124 paintings , ' she explains			2
' to get the iconic feeling across by using similar lighting to the @entity124 masters , which i hope will get that point across			1
' despite the tragic circumstances of many of her models , @entity11 also hopes that people will find the images as beautiful as she does			2

' some of the women are iconic to me			0
