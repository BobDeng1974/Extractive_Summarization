this haunting image of an empty road leading to an erupting volcano was captured by a photographer who appears to be on the highway to hell			2
the stunning snap was taken on @entity7 , near @entity8 , a small village under threat from volcanic lava flows on @entity12 's main island			1
the road had only just been cleared after being covered by previous flows but the cause of that lava - the @entity18 crater - can still be seen ominously spewing fire in the background			1
highway : this haunting image of an empty road leads to an erupting volcano in the distance on @entity25 , near @entity8 , @entity12 night sky : a red truck comes to a standstill on the highway which had been cleared after being covered by previous lava flows from the @entity18 crater @entity33 store worker and part - time photographer @entity32 took a series of amazing pictures which show the strikingly bright orange of the volcanic explosion glowing against the pitch black night sky			1
despite working full - time , @entity32 and some of his friends often spend nights out in the @entity44 bush photographing this amazing crater			2
in some images the whole night sky above the local town is illuminated by the lava and in others the light produced by the volcano makes it look like an image from another world			1
@entity56 has been fascinated by the @entity18 crater - pronounced ' poo - oo oh - oh ' - which is is a spatter cone in the eastern rift zone of the @entity61 volcano of the @entity44			1

as we headed to the volcano the weather conditions were unfavourable so instead we decided to take pictures of the ocean			0
' we got to the ocean and the weather was still pouring down rain			0
after waiting an hour for the rain to stop we gave up and started heading home			0
on the way back on a rarely travelled road called chain of craters the clouds opened up enough to see the glow of the lava in a distance			2
' we never expected for this to happen and didnt even know that it could be seen so clearly at this location			0
' we pulled over stood in amazement for about 15 minutes			0
we finally grabbed our camera gear out of the truck to capture what we had seen			0
' this was a incredible experience for all of us seeing how the road just heads up to the lava going up the slopes of @entity61			2
' daytime : the amazing crater is seen here during the day with an orange glow illuminating everything in the middle of the @entity44 bush threat : the rocky landscape of @entity8 is seen here , as the striking bright orange volcanic explosion glows against the pitch black night sky stunning : despite working full - time the photographer and his friends often spend nights out in the @entity44 bush photographing this crater @entity146 hue : @entity32 said he pulled over and stood in amazement for about 15 minutes before getting his camera gear out of the truck view : the @entity18 crater is seen through this viewpoint spewing fire in the background which looms over the entire landscape beautiful : residents in the small village are used to the volcano as they are often under threat from volcanic lava flows on @entity12 's main island @entity162 : trees and parched grass line the place where the @entity18 crater erupts and can be seen billowing smoke in the background			1
