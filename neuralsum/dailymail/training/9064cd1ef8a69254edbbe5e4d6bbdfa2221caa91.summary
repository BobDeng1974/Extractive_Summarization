mr @entity8 , a forklift truck driver , said : ‘ i was shocked			0
having guns pointed within an inch of my eyes is not the most fun			0
‘ i had been sitting in bed and i ’d dozed off watching something on telly			2
the next thing i know i ’m being ordered out of bed at gunpoint			0
with miss @entity7 ’s condition worsening the pair were taken to a nearby police station while officers conducted a forensic fingertip search of their flat			1
@entity8 says he was questioned for four hours about the ' firearm ' before being released without charge detectives confirmed during the pair ’s interview that the paramedic believed he had spotted mr @entity59 holding a firearm			0
miss @entity7 said : ‘ the police told us the medic had seen a 10in long black firearm being held by @entity8 as he lay in bed			1

the way i was treated in my own home was very traumatic			0
i already suffer from anxiety and then to suffer the indignity of being arrested for absolutely nothing has just alleviated this			0
