by @entity0 published : 08:32 est , 10 may 2013 updated : 11:08 est , 10 may 2013 a surge of millions of baby eels in the @entity3 this spring has meant local restaurants can serve the delicacy for the first time in years			1
@entity7 catches in the river around @entity9 have been their highest for 30 years - meaning there are enough of the tiny worm - like fish to make their way onto @entity17 menus at cut down prices			1
this year numbers could reach up to 100million - ten times more than last year			1
millions more elver eels have appeared in the @entity3 meaning restaurants can now serve them for the first time in years and at cut - down prices so many have been caught this spring that the city 's elver station had to close for two weeks because its storage tanks were full and it was turning away fishermen trying to sell them			1
in past generations elver eels were a cheap and popular local delicacy			1
but in the 70s and 80s the demand for them in the @entity33 - where they are credited with aphrodisiac qualities - turned them into a luxury as expensive as caviar			1
since the recent surge in numbers prices being paid to the fishermen have dropped from £ 200 a kilo at the start of the season to just £ 85			1
because the @entity17 @entity47 station at @entity48 , near @entity9 , was closed fishermen were selling their catches elsewhere - including to the @entity52 restaurant in @entity53 where chef @entity54 has put them on the menu			1
@entity59 , of @entity17 @entity60 , at his elver station with some of the baby eels he has caught this year he bought two kilos last week and is serving 20gram helpings cooked with bacon and scrambled egg for £ 8.50 a plate			2
' @entity60 are meant to be a critically endangered species but it certainly does n't look like it here , ' said @entity59 of @entity17 @entity60			2
' we have had huge catches such as we have not seen for a couple of decades			0
' i would say the catch has been 20 times larger than it was at the low point four years ago			1
' mr @entity59 's firm sends elvers to countries across @entity76 for re-stocking of rivers - @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 are among the destinations			2
he believes that the numbers caught this year could be enough to keep rivers healthily stocked with eels for six to 10 years			1
so far , 660,000 @entity3 elvers have been donated for re-stocking rivers in this country and that figure will rise at the end of the season , he said			0
the elvers need to be taken out of the @entity3 and relocated because flood barriers are now so effective that they would be unable to reach other streams and tributaries and would perish			2
@entity99 , former chairman of @entity100 and now chairman of the @entity102 , said ' it is just extraordinary how many elvers there have been in the @entity3 this season			0
' he said the precise reasons why there are shortages some years and gluts others can not be explained			2
but the variation of currents in the @entity113 as the elvers are swept from the @entity115 to the @entity3 could be part of the reason			0
' they migrate with the tide and they come up the river in waves			0
there have been tales this year of fifty mile streams of elvers , ' he said			2
mr @entity99 said 330,000 elvers have been released into rivers in @entity130 today another 330,000 are being put into the @entity131 at @entity132			0
one of the reasons why @entity3 elvers are in so much demand for restocking programmes is that the way they are caught - with traditional trough - shaped ' artisan ' nets - does not damage them in the same way as fishing methods elsewhere , said mr @entity99			2
he was not pleased , however , to be told that elvers are back on restaurant menus again			0
' we are not that keen on them being eaten although it is better than them just being wasted if they get stuck in the river , ' he said			0
experts believe the number of elver eels ( pictured ) caught this year could be enough to keep rivers healthily stocked for six to 10 years the worst year for elver catches on the @entity3 was 2009 when about a million were netted			1
the following year it was about 3 million and then in 2011 and 2012 there were 9 - 12 million			1
' this year we could be talking about 100million - ten times last year , ' he said			1
' the @entity17 @entity60 station had 1 - 2 tonnes in one night - that 's four million elvers			0
the catches are the biggest for at least 20 - 30 years			1
' back in the 1970s , when elvers were plentiful , riverside dwellers ate them regularly - and there was an annual @entity168 elver eating contest on the village green at @entity170 on @entity3			0
competitors would sit on a makeshift stage and wolf down a plate of one pound of fried elvers ( half a pound in the ladies contest )			0
but the competion had to be stopped when elvers became scarce and highly expensive			0
now , shoppers in @entity9 have the chance to try the local delicacy cooked the traditional way at the @entity184 restaurant in @entity53 street			0
chef @entity54 said : ' i still had to pay £ 100 a kilo for the ones i bought but it is rare for them to be available to restaurants so we wanted to have some			0
' the elver dishes are just flying out of the door and i shall only be able to serve them for a couple more days before we run out			0

@entity7 eel numbers could reach 100million this year - ten times last year
fishermen say it is the largest *harvest* they *'ve* seen in 30 years
this has meant restaurants can serve the delicacy at reduced prices
