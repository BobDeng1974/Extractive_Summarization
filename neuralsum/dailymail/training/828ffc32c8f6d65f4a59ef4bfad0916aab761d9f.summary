pity the poor deck hands on this monster			0
its bow and stern are half a kilometre apart and you could fit four football pitches onto it			0
now , the world 's largest ' floating facility ' , which is longer than the height of the @entity11 , has taken to the water for the first time			0
@entity15 shipbuilder @entity14 floated the partially built tanker - shaped vessel - named @entity16 - at its southern shipyard in geoje on november 30			1
the 1,601ft - long ( 488m ) floating liquefied natural gas ( @entity21 ) platform can not be described as a ship because it is unable to move under its own steam and must be towed			1
longer than the height of the @entity11 , it has taken to the water , off the coast of @entity15 , for the first time at 242ft wide and 360ft high , it is expected to produce 3.6m tonnes of liquefied natural gas a year - and its storage tanks have a capacity equivalent to approximately 175 @entity38 swimming pools but its specifications are impressive , outstripping the 1,453ft ( 443m ) - tall @entity11 in @entity42			1
once complete , the facility will weigh more than 600,000 tonnes fully loaded , displacing the same amount of water as six of the world 's largest aircraft carriers			0
and at 242ft wide and 360ft high , it is expected to produce 3.6million tonnes of lng a year - and its storage tanks have a capacity equivalent to approximately 175 @entity38 swimming pools			1
commissioned by the @entity54 energy giant @entity53 , the vessel is due to be delivered by september 2016			1
in a press release on its website , @entity53 said @entity16 would operate in a remote basin around 295 miles northeast of @entity58 , a town in @entity59 , for around 25 years			1
it is an all - weather facility designed to withstand the most powerful category - five cyclone			0
which is just as well as it will be producing enough gas to supply a city the size of @entity68			0
the 1,601ft ( 488m ) - long floating liquefied natural gas platform can not be described as a ship because it is unable to move under its own steam and must be towed @entity53 has shied away from offering estimates of @entity16 's likely cost , but analysts say @entity21 could end up less expensive			1
it has put the cost of @entity16 at up to £ 7.7billion ( $ 12.6bn )			0
at 600,000 tonnes with its storage tanks full , @entity16 will be vast , but it takes up just a quarter of the space a land - based lng plant of a similar capacity would occupy because components are stacked on top of each other			1
lng plants need access to the ocean anyway so that @entity50 tankers can load			0
@entity21 eliminates the need for land purchase and reduces environmental objections			0
with cooling water straight from the ocean and gas piped straight into lng tankers , there is no need for long seabed pipelines and jetty construction			0
@entity53 's earliest flng designs were made in the 1990s but ended up shelved because of the economic recession and technical difficulties			2
the company started looking again at the idea in the early 2000s , but it was the discovery of the @entity16 field in 2007 - too small and too remote to develop any other way - that gave the technology its first shot in the real world			2
a final investment decision was taken to go ahead with the @entity16 in 2011			0
its keel was laid in may this year and two giant sections of its hull built on opposite sides of the harbour were joined together in the summer at @entity121			0
we 're gon na need an even bigger boat ? as @entity16 leaves dry dock for the first time , developer @entity53 wants to consolidate its advantage as the first mover in floating liquefied natural gas - an as - yet untried technology for which @entity16 will be the flagship			1
the oil company 's technicians are designing something even larger and tougher than @entity16 , a vessel that will need to last 25 years moored in the @entity137 's ' cyclone alley ' off @entity59 's northwest coast			1
' yes we will move bigger and move into more extreme environments , ' said @entity140 , @entity53 's general manager of integrated gas programmes and innovation			1
' we are designing a larger facility			0
that will be the next car off the rails			0
' @entity16 , which analysts says may cost over £ 7billion ( $ 12bn ) to build , is a potential game changer for the oil and gas industry			2
if it is an economic success , gas fields worldwide that are too far out to sea and too small to develop any other way could become viable for lng production			0
the prototype vessel 's most likely first copy model of similar size will now be for the @entity160 project - another venture for gas off @entity59			1
escalating costs forced backers to dump their original , land - based lng plant plans , and in september this year , they decided to go ahead with @entity53 's @entity21 technology instead			1
' the browse structure will be 90 per cent the same as @entity16 , ' said @entity140 - citing the ' design one , build many ' mantra @entity53 hopes will eventually pay off and placate shareholders worried about the firm 's total $ 45billion - a - year capital spending bill			1
@entity160 's developer , @entity175 , said in october it may use as many as three of the @entity21 vessels that @entity53 is developing along with @entity14 and oil and gas engineers @entity178			1
an even bigger @entity21 plant than the ones to be built for @entity16 and @entity160 could make life more interesting for the competition			2
a wide range of land - based ' wannabe ' lng exporters in @entity188 , @entity189 and east @entity190 all hope to tap the burgeoning @entity193 gas demand in the same way a number of @entity197 and @entity198 - based @entity50 developments will be doing over the coming few years			2
anchored about 125 miles off the @entity197 coast , @entity16 will chill the gas to reduce its volume by a factor of 600 and load it on to specialised lng tankers			2
@entity16 will only produce about 3.6 million tonnes a year ( mtpa ) of lng along with its 5.3 mtpa of liquids and other hydrocarbons - a fraction of some land - based lng plants			0
@entity140 envisages a bigger version could produce far more - giving it economies of scale closer to those to be enjoyed by bigger land - based producing plants such as @entity214 , a 15.6 mtpa plant taking shape on northwest @entity59 's coast to tap offshore gas			2
@entity214 , led by @entity53 's @entity198 - based rival @entity219 , should be producing in early 2015 , well ahead of @entity16 , but it is way over budget and now scheduled to cost £ 31billion ( $ 52bn ) against an original £ 23billion ( $ 37bn )			1
plans for a land - based browse plant were cancelled this year as its likely cost reached £ 27billion ( $ 45bn ) , and the outlook for global gas demand faltered			0
the @entity16 's specifications are impressive , outstripping the 1,453ft ( 443m ) - tall @entity11 in @entity42 ( right )			2

@entity15 shipbuilder @entity14 floated partially built tanker - shaped vessel - *prelude* - at its southern shipyard in geoje
liquefied natural gas platform can not be called a ship as it is unable to move under its own steam and must be towed
@entity241 's storage tanks have a capacity equivalent to approximately 175 @entity38 swimming pools
commissioned by @entity54 energy giant @entity53 , the facility is due to be delivered by september 2016
@entity16 will operate in a remote basin around 295 miles northeast of @entity58 , @entity59 , for around 25 years
