by @entity0 published : 11:48 est , 7 december 2012 updated : 14:16 est , 7 december 2012 the last photography craze to sweep the internet , known as ' planking ' , saw people balancing poker - straight on inanimate , often dangerous , objects			1
but a new craze has gone viral whereby internet users picture themselves doing something even more risky - taking their heads off			2
photographs are beginning to flood the web showing seemingly beheaded people standing beside a detached head			0
the name is derived from the @entity24 craze : @entity26 is not a new craze and is thought to have been performed in front of cameras since the 1920s ouch : people adopt humourous positions to make it appear they have been beheaded with the swift death of ' planking ' and ' owling ' , it was only a matter of time before ' horsemaning ' had its moment once more			1
spurred by historical pictures of people cleverly posing as if they had been beheaded , internet users have flooded sites with their own takes on the concept			1
the craze is a homage to the folklore character , the @entity24			1
the optical trick sees people positioning their bodies so that their head can not be seen			0
another person then positions themselves nearby , making it appear that the head has been detached			0
heads will roll : whether it is going to work , or posing by the @entity56 , tricksters can easily seize the moment for a spot of horsemanning open wider : @entity26 helps this man eat a slice of pizza while lying on his back head on a string : internet users get the opportunity to show off their flexibility , with this woman bending backwards to hide her head the set - up allows people room for improvisation , often with hilarious results			2
but if the savvy photgraphers taking the snaps think they are being wholly original by partaking in the craze , they may want to think again			0
@entity26 dates as far back as the 1920s , when it was a popular way to pose for photographs			0
inventive users often use props such as sofas to perform the trick , but some are slightly darker , placing their headless bodies in machines and under cars			0
it is the latest in a series of trends to take over message boards and forums			2
before ' planking ' , the internet was awash with people ' owling ' , whereby they would sit like the nocturnal bird in unusual positions			1
@entity63 in your hand : other popular photography crazes inlcude ' planking ' and ' owling ' giraffe : one man shows off his take on horsemanning , or perhaps just a very long neck props : people often use sofas and chairs to get in the right positions to take the snaps			1
