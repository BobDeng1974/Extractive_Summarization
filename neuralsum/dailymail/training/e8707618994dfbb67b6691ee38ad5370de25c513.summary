while the wet forecast dampened spirits , it was welcomed by water companies desperate for rainfall			1
showers of hailstone hit several parts of @entity6 and a @entity18 police spokesman advised motorists to adapt their driving after the sudden downpours affecting the east of the county			1
grey skies : clouds gather over a mute swan beside the @entity27 at @entity28 , @entity29 , during sporadic downpours of rain and hailstones gloomy : while the damp forecast will dampen spirits , it will be welcomed by water companies desperate for rainfall @entity37 has not yet come : during the last couple of years @entity6 has had a lot of warm and dry weather in april so these chilly and unsettled conditions have come as something of a surprise during the last couple of years @entity6 has had a lot of warm and dry weather in april so these chilly and unsettled conditions have come as something of a surprise			1
but they are a normal set of circumstances for april and it is the last two years that have been rather unusual			0
a @entity52 spokesperson said ' this is very typical april showers weather and the last few years have been the exception			2
' but anyone hoping for a relaxation of the hosepipe ban will be sadly disappointed , as experts warn it would take more than a month of heavy rain to replenish water levels			1
tonight showers will gradually become lighter and more isolated through the evening , with many areas becoming dry and clear overnight			0
but temperatures look set to fall again , with frost developing , especially in rural parts			0
tomorrow the weather is not expected to be as as heavy and thundery as recent days , with some sunshine breaking through , but it will still be quite cold and maximum temperatures are predicted to peak at 11 Â° @entity71 the weekend looks set to be slightly drier than the past week and the @entity52 have predicted it will be a ' fine and sunny on sunday , although slightly cold as temperatures will only reach @entity75 and @entity76 ( @entity74 )			1
' there were major contrasts in the weather across the country , while parts of the south were covered with hailstone and heavy rain , @entity77 at @entity78 , still managed go ahead			1
lucky escape : today a family escaped unharmed after their house on the @entity91 was struck by lightning force of nature : a small fire broke out , but a hail storm put out the flames before it spread the sun may not have shone in @entity98 but the gathering storm clouds were no deterrent for the ladies of @entity102 , who gathered today for the first day of the world famous race meet			1
paying no heed to the chill in the air , they donned their best outfits for the occasion - the weather was more sociable than seen further down south with many areas hit by hailstone storms and heavy rain			1
the strong thunderstorms across @entity6 resulted in a family running from their home after their house was struck by lightning earlier this afternoon			1
@entity122 and @entity123 and their 14 - year - old daughter @entity124 and @entity123 's daughter @entity126 , along with two dogs , were in the house at @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity91 when lighting hit the roof at around 2.40pm			1
a small fire broke out , but a hail storm put out the flames before it spread			0
mr @entity123 said : ' everyone is safe , everyone is out of the house			2
my daughter @entity124 is in a bit of shock , but she is all right			0
' the electricity came down the tv aerial			0
slates have been blown off the roof and it brought the upstairs ceiling down and the electrics were blown			0
icy fall : a passer by braves a heavy hail shower in @entity154 , @entity155 not quite @entity37 : as bulbs blossom into spring flowers , they are now surrounded by hailstones ' the electricity went off , then flickered and then there was this bang			2
' my daughter started screaming from upstairs , the ceiling came down on top of her , but she was not hurt			0
' they are inspecting the damage , but we certainly wo n't be able to sleep here tonight			0
' @entity172 station manager for the @entity173 said : ' there is severe damage to the roof and inside the property			1
' @entity178 also struck a telegraph pole two fields away , which was dealt with by fire crews from @entity182			1
' a @entity184 spokesman said around 2,300 homes were without power in parts of @entity131 , @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 and @entity191			1
power is expected to be restored in stages by the end of today , the spokesman said			1
@entity52 forecaster @entity196 warned that it will be around a degree colder each day until sunday			0
' the areas facing the biggest risk of showers are the eastern part of @entity203 and @entity204 , ' he added			0
' although this will die away a bit overnight it will be back tomorrow , when there could even be hail			0
white cover : gardens in @entity154 , @entity155 were covered by hail storms heavy rain : a car wheel in a flooded gulley near @entity154 , @entity155 ' the unsettled conditions will continue until next week , when we will start to see bands of rain instead of showers , which means more prolonged wet weather			1
' around 50mm is expected to fall by sunday , which is the same as the total rainfall expected for the whole month			0
but much more rain would be needed to fill rivers and reservoirs and relieve the drought in the @entity227			2
weather experts said that areas affected by drought need more than 400mm of rain to get back to normal levels			1
in @entity204 , ski resorts have been told that they may be able to reopen thanks to a chance of snowfall			0
it is a stark contrast to last april - which was the hottest since 1910 , with temperatures regularly topping 25c ( @entity241 ) - and comes just weeks after a march heatwave that sent scores of @entity244 to the beach			0
mr @entity246 said : ' we 're going to need an awful lot of rain over a great deal of time to solve the drought problem			2
anything is going to help , but it does not look like what we 're going to see over the next few days will be sustainable			0
' days at the races : despite the cold weather the crowd at @entity78 races , @entity102 all donned their traditional bright outfits lucky : compared to the hailstone in the south of the country , the race goers were lucky with their sun , if not chilly weather the @entity266 yesterday warned that drought - afflicted areas , like much of southern of @entity203 , are at higher risk of flash flooding , especially in built - up areas			1
dry , compacted soils mean that rainfall is less easily absorbed into the ground , increasing the likelihood of flooding if the country is hit by storms			2
this was seen in june and july 2007 , when a dry winter and spring were followed by devastating floods , which hit the @entity282 , @entity283 and @entity284			2
the forecast looks bleak for those heading to @entity77 at @entity78 on saturday			1
steady rain is forecast in the @entity102 area over the next few days and conditions on the course are expected to be the muddiest and most difficult since the famous mudbath of 2001 , when @entity292 splashed to victory riding @entity294			1
clerk of the course @entity297 expects the ground to be ' soft ' - but expects the race to go ahead , regardless how muddy it gets			2
he said : ' we 've had at least 13mm of steady drizzle and , looking at the radar , there should be more to come on tuesday with further possible showers on wednesday and thursday			0
' ' the grass is in excellent condition , partly as a result of the warm winter we had , and that makes a difference , as it will help soak up a lot of the moisture , ' he told the @entity315			0
' but the going is already soft in most places on the national course and we 're definitely looking at conditions being on the slow side			0
we 've been aiming to get something between good and good to soft			0
' changing weather : three day weather forecast from friday to sunday lightning flashes during a thunderstorm it has been a while since such widespread outbreaks of thunderstorms , so this is an ideal opportunity to look at lightning and its varieties			1
most people make a distinction between sheet lightning and forked lightning			2
however , sheet lightning is merely a lightning stroke within a cloud or between clouds ( or below the horizon )			2
it is obscured by the clouds themselves , making them diffusely refulgent			0
this is known as cloud - to - cloud lightning , caused by differing electric potential within a cloud or across clouds			2
sometimes it is visible , especially in mature thunder clouds , as a filigree wandering across the underside of the anvil - hence the name ' anvil crawler			0
' the most dangerous , though , is cloud - to - ground lightning , often shortened to @entity178 , caused by the potential between the negatively charged base of the cloud and the positively charged ground			1
ground - to - cloud lightning ( @entity362 ) is rarer , initiated from the ground rather than the cloud , often by a tall building or tower			2
most @entity178 strikes comprise negative strokes ( negative charge in the cloud base transferring to the ground ) but about 5 % are positive strokes , which are more powerful			1
these originate high in the cloud where there can be a strong positive charge ; occasionally this will be in the anvil itself			0
the lightning may hit the ground directly beneath the cloud but can strike below the tenuous edges of the anvil , sometimes more than nine miles ( 15km ) away from the cloud 's centre			1
this can give the appearance of appearing out of nowhere - hence the figurative basis of the metaphorical phrase a bolt from the blue			0

@entity393 , heavy rain and gusts of wind swept across @entity6 today
racing at @entity398 had to be *abandoned* after surfaces became waterlogged , but races at @entity78 still managed to go ahead
@entity402 escaped without injury after lightning hit their @entity173 house
@entity178 struck a telegraph pole leaving 2,300 homes without power on @entity91
bleak *outlook* for ' muddiest @entity77 since 2001 '
more prolonged wet weather to come next week
