the @entity8 midfielder has been in talks with club chiefs about signing an improved deal that will keep him at the @entity13 until 2017 - his current contract ends in 2016 @entity15 understands that @entity5 and @entity3 , who turned 29 in december , are close to finalising terms that will lift his salary to around £ 80,000 - a - week			1
@entity41 , 29 , has approved a new deal that will tie him to the club until the summer of 2017 , while @entity40 , 33 , has agreed a new one - year rolling contract			1
@entity33 revealed after @entity5 ’s victory over @entity50 last weekend that @entity40 had agreed fresh terms and it is believed that @entity41 and now @entity3 are close to following suit			1
however , @entity5 have not yet secured the future of one of their longest - serving players , defender @entity55 , who is out of contract in the summer and has offers on the table from a string of clubs , including @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65			2
@entity3 has been a virtual ever - present in @entity33 ’s team since joining from @entity68 in the summer of 2012 - making 81 appearances and scoring 18 goals			0
he has played principally on the flanks following the £ 42.5million club - record signing of @entity73 last august but his technique , touch and combination play is considered by @entity33 to be crucial to his side ’s style of play			0
@entity81 chiefs , led by contract negotiator @entity82 , have been busy over the last year securing the futures of the club ’s most influential players			0
@entity88 sextet @entity87 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 all signed new deals just over 12 months ago , while goalkeeper @entity95 penned an improved contract earlier in the season			0
not bad ! @entity33 has done well in securing the long - term services of some of his top players crucial : the @entity81 recently managed to tie midfielder @entity87 down to the club for his best years looking ahead : @entity91 is blossoming centrally and out wide for the title chasers different player ! goalscoring @entity90 has been a revelation for @entity5 throughout this campaign 16580 35829 42586 26587 83128 34598			1
