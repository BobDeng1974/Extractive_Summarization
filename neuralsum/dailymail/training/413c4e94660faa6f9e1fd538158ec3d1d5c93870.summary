by @entity0 published : 11:04 est , 15 july 2013 updated : 03:59 est , 16 july 2013 they 're sweet , creamy and cold – just the way a good summer treat should be			2
but summer cooler drinks have been branded ' toxic sugar bombs ' after it was discovered that they contain up to 20 teaspoons of sugar - that 's the equivalent of 31 digestive biscuits			1
an investigation by @entity12 found that summer cooler drinks from coffee giants such as @entity15 and @entity16 contain a worrying amount of sugar			1
@entity20 bomb : an investigation has shown that iced coffees from high street coffee giants contain an alarmingly high amount of sugar they found that a medium @entity27 contains a shocking 81.6 grams of sugar - the same content as in 31 digestive biscuits			1
not only is the sugar content an issue , the drink also contains the recommended daily amount of saturated fat for a woman in just a few sips			1
starbucks are also guilty of packing the sugar into their summer drinks			1
one culprit is the large @entity41 , which contains a staggering 76.2 grams of sugar – that 's more than 18 teaspoons ' worth			1
health warning : @entity15 and @entity16 are amongst the worst culprits with a @entity47 ( @entity48 ) containing a shocking 81.6 grams of sugar - the same content as in 31 digestive biscuits it may appear healthy because it contains fruit in the title but the frappuccino also contains a massive 459 calories because of its cream and full - fat milk content			1
that 's almost as many calories as a @entity60 's @entity59 not so sweet : @entity15 's @entity47 contains the recommended daily amount of saturated fat for a woman in just a few sips the @entity16 peppermint mocha frappuccino in venti with whole milk and whipped cream is 540 calories			2
a spokesman for @entity16 said : ' we promote choice at @entity16 and were one of the first high street food and drink retailers to display calorie content on our menu boards , as part of our commitment to the @entity81 ’s @entity80			1
' all product nutritional information is also easily available on our website to help inform customers ’ choices			0
' @entity86 is one of a range of summer drinks we offer at @entity16 , from indulgent treats like a @entity92 to a @entity93			0
for example , a grande ( medium ) @entity96 contains 17g of sugar and less than 100 calories			1
customers can also customise their drinks to reduce calorie and sugar content - we have a @entity104 , which reduces calories by approximately a third			1
customers can also choose to have a smaller size , skimmed milk , sugar free syrups , and forgo whipped cream			2
' @entity15 's strawberry cooler is an even worse offender - a large size with cream and full fat milk is 653 calories - that 's the same as having a @entity60 's burger and fries			0
meanwhile , @entity120 's whole milk caramel frappe latte is 455 calories , the equivalent to two large glasses of white wine and some pretzels			0
now that brands are under more pressure to display nutritional information on their products , consumers are becoming more savvy to the hidden calories in shop bought coffees			0
with this in mind , anti-obesity ­ campaigners have called for the government to impose limits on calories and sugars			0
dr @entity142 , head of the @entity143 , told the @entity12 that the stance taken by the likes of @entity15 and ­ @entity16 is only contributing to the obesity crisis			0
he told them : ' the nutritional information for these drinks is quite staggering			0
' the ­ combination of one of these beverages with , say , a brownie is actually quite toxic			2
' you ’re looking at a sugar bomb			2
it ’s because of products like this that people are facing an obesity crisis			0
there can be no responsible justification for it			0
' a spokesman for @entity15 told @entity165 : @entity15 takes the nutritional balance of all its food and drink very seriously			0
' we have increased the quality of information available in store and online via our costa nutritional tool and have carried out a lot of work , particularly in the iced drink range to reduce calorie content with the intention to continuing to find ways to reduce fat , calories and sugar levels throughout our product offerings			1
' last year we introduced our iced - lemonades to the range , with the primo size containing less than 100 calories			0
our @entity188 has fewer than @entity189			0
' @entity15 seeks to provide customers with a choice of products across its drink and food ranges , meeting all key health trends ; allowing them to choose lower - calorie options if they so wish as well as a more indulgent occasional treat '			2
the 18 teaspoons of sugar found in the @entity16 iced drink is equivalent to eating : an entire box of six mr @entity202 tarts 11 packs of @entity205 's @entity204 sweets 19 30g servings of @entity208 's @entity207 2 @entity210 bars			1

@entity212 contains same sugar content as 31 digestive biscuits
@entity41 contains more than 18 teaspoons worth of sugar
