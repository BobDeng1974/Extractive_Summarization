why not just get @entity34 to design the next one ? is @entity4 's 50th anniversary edition cover ' over sexualised ' ? ‘ i ’m not sure why adults need a different cover anyway , but who was it who decided that ‘ adult ’ meant ‘ inappropriately sexualised ’ ? ’ @entity43 , an award - winning children ’s author , said : ‘ i ’m not liking the new cover for @entity4 , looks more @entity47 ! ’ fans of the book also commented on the picture on social media			1
