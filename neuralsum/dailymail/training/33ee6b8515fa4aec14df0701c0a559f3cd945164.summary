by @entity0 for @entity1 and @entity2 for @entity3 with spring on the way , most @entity4 are getting a haircut			2
but a shearing has been especially welcome for @entity8 - the sheep who was found wandering the island state of @entity12 with one of the world 's heaviest ever fleeces			1
the gigantic sheep has now shed 23.5kg of wool , enough to make 40 jumpers and just shy of the world record set by another lost sheep ten years ago			1
he is pictured just before it took place after : aah , that 's better ! @entity8 appeared spindly and trembling after his haircut at the hands of @entity34 and mrs @entity35 - with thin legs for an animal that was previously carrying the weight of a seven - year - old child farmers @entity40 and @entity35 found the six - year - old ram in scrubland on sunday and nicknamed him @entity43 after the character from the tv series @entity46 and @entity46			1
' he could n't see very well because of the wool over his face , so i snuck up behind him and grabbed him , ' mr @entity47 told @entity51			2
@entity8 's tag suggests he is from a farm hundreds of kilometres away on @entity12 's east coast , meaning he has been wandering across the state for years			1
' it is the heaviest sheep i 've ever lifted , ' said mr @entity47 's wife @entity35			0
' i just could n't believe it , i just could not believe a sheep could have so much wool			0
' hard work : @entity8 during his haircut in the @entity64 of @entity12			1
he was almost the world 's heaviest gigantic : @entity8 earlier this week			0
farmer @entity47 managed to pounce on him because he could not see also amazing was that @entity8 was able to survive in the wild for so long			0
' usually they get cast and ca n't get up , or they get fly - struck or the hot weather gets to them , ' mr @entity47 said			0
@entity8 's haircut today revealed a trembling , spindly animal under his mass of hair			1
it must have been a shock to the animal , as his fleece has become one of the heaviest ever sheared from a single sheep			1
but it does not beat the world record , which is held by a @entity84 named @entity85			2
the merino shot to international fame in 2004 after he avoided being caught and shorn for six years			0
merinos are normally shorn annually , but @entity85 apparently hid in caves , avoiding muster			0
his fleece weighed an astonishing 27kg , and he was even taken to meet @entity94 's prime minister			2
monstrous : @entity85 's bulk came close to beating the world record set by a @entity94 merino sheep in 2004 celebrity : sadly @entity85 ( pictured ) retains the title			1
he was even taken to see @entity94 's prime minister			0

*colossal* animal was found wandering on @entity12 farm on sunday
today he was finally sheared and came close to entering the record books
his vast fleece is *estimated* to be enough to make 40 woolly jumpers
