by @entity0 published : 04:10 est , 12 august 2013 updated : 14:51 est , 15 august 2013 too busy to boil an egg ? no need to worry , because one supermarket is about to sell ready - to - eat , hard - boiled eggs			1
for carbohydrate - avoiders in a hurry , they might be the perfect answer , but if you 're sitting next to someone on a bus who gets one out , you may not be so sure			0
this week @entity13 will start selling individual , hard - boiled and peeled eggs at 69p each			1
hitting the supermarkets this week : individually - wrapped , ready - peeled hard - boiled eggs will cost 69p each given that a dozen free range eggs at the supermarket cost Â£ 2.92 , or 24.5p each , you are paying more than double for the convenience of someone else having boiled it and peeled it for you			1
but producers @entity24 , who say are sure their low - carb , low - fat , and high protein eggs @entity26 will be a hit			0
and they reckon they 've already tackled the nasty sulphur smell that often accompanies hard - boiled eggs , by packaging them with an absorbency patch to soak it up			1
original @entity24 managing director @entity38 told @entity39 : ' the convenience food market is a huge growth area right now , and we think this will appeal to all sorts of people			0
' our research shows that men who go to the gym like to snack on eggs , as well as people on low carbohydrate diets , and they will also be good for picnics and children 's packed lunches			0
' the eggs will have a shelf - life of up to eight days , similar to egg mayonnaise in sandwiches			0
or you could diy : @entity61 recommends cooking an egg for six to seven minutes if you want it hard - boiled @entity13 buyer @entity64 said the eggs contained just 60 calories each and were a ' brilliant healthy snack '			1
he said : ' the food - to - go market is a destination shop for many customers to @entity13 and being able to offer this unique , single ready - to - eat snacking egg is very exciting			2
' ready - boiled eggs have been tried before - in 2009 the @entity73 launched a two - pack of them for 89p , but the product was criticised for its smell and excess water in the packaging			2
but ms @entity38 reckons that by selling them individually and with the odour absorbency patch , her company has cracked it this time .			0

individually wrapped , boiled and peeled eggs will go on sale at @entity13
producers @entity86 say convenience foods are *soaring*
each egg will be wrapped with an absorbency *pad* to soak up sulphur smell
the 69p eggs will be aimed at gym - goers , busy mums and those on diets
