by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 8 february 2014 updated : 17:02 est , 8 february 2014 it 's just a couple of miles from @entity4 film studios - where movies such as @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 were filmed - and @entity10 has played its own part in showbiz history			1
the @entity16 - born @entity15 tv personalities @entity13 and his wife @entity17 once owned the 19th century , seven - bedroom mansion - which is now on the market for a guide price of £ 3 million			1
@entity13 and @entity17 were household names in the 1950s and 1960s			1
@entity13 is best remembered for @entity22 's on the @entity23 - a precursor to @entity25 's @entity26 - in which he showcased his acerbic wit			2
@entity29 , @entity4 , bought for £ 650,000 by mr @entity30 and mrs @entity31 @entity17 is remembered for regular appearances on the hugely popular @entity34 sunday night panel show what 's my line ? in the couple 's heyday , @entity38 devoted eight pages to an ' at home ' interview with them and their three children			1
the couple spent nine years at @entity29 , in @entity47 , where the garden leads down to @entity49 , which flows into the @entity50			1
in 1959 they sold the house to actor @entity53 and his wife @entity54 , who lived there with their six children			2
@entity53 starred in 40 films , including @entity60 comedies @entity59 ! and the @entity61			2
but he is renowned for the @entity64 - winning 1953 picture @entity62 , in which he starred alongside @entity66			2
he died aged 55 in 1975			2
earlier , the pub down the road from @entity29 was a focus of @entity71 gossip , as it was where trysts between @entity73 and @entity74 were conducted while @entity74 was still married to @entity76			2
' the @entity77 held parties here where they played host to stars such as @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 , ' says current owner @entity84 , 74			2
' we feel very dull in comparison , ' says his wife @entity87 , 67			0
while the central part of the house is @entity91 in style , there are sprawling arts and crafts and @entity96 additions that the @entity97 believe were added by an early architect owner			0
these include a stunning room at the top of the house with stained - glass windows and a vaulted ceiling - now @entity30 's study			1
former resident @entity53 in a scene from the 1949 film @entity59 ! the @entity97 bought the house 16 years ago from a dentist who had bought it from @entity111			1
she had stayed on in the house for several years after @entity53 's death			1
@entity54 is still alive and living in the @entity114 and until recently made twice - yearly pilgrimages to @entity10			1
a devout @entity116 , she built a small - and unconsecrated - chapel in the grounds which still stands today on the acre of land across the creek which is included in the house sale			0
when the @entity97 bought it for £ 650,000 , they had a teenage son and daughter and the house was in need of a lot of work			1
' we were living in @entity132 and had no intention of moving , but a property magazine came through the letterbox and we could n't resist coming to have a look , ' says @entity87 , who used to run her own human resources consultancy			0
three days later they had put in an offer , despite their home not being on the market			0
the couple spent £ 250,000 rewiring , installing a new roof , ripping out the dated bathrooms and moving the kitchen from a small anteroom to the middle of the house , where it now looks over the garden down to the creek			1
they kept one part of the house as a self - contained cottage , which they now let out			0
the couple retained original features , such as the stunning oak panels in the drawing room , and replaced some of the broken sash windows and doors			0
they uncovered original fireplaces , which had been painted or boarded over , and restored some stained - glass windows			0
they had the garden redesigned and landscaped and renovated stone balustrades on the patio			0
' i love to restore things - it was a labour of love , ' says @entity30 , a former accountant who retired a year into the three - year project			1
we hired a builder to do the work for us but i was his apprentice and learnt a lot from him			0
' the warm , comfortable sitting room at @entity10 according to estate agent @entity180 of @entity181 , @entity10 is so unique that there is little to compare it to in the vicinity , although he explains it 's not uncommon to pay a 35 to 40 per cent premium for a waterside property in @entity4			1
he says prices in the area have been pushed up because of a lack of stock , adding : ' traditionally , the beginning of the year is a time to sell , but we have n't seen the usual influx			0
mortgages are a little more difficult to get so perhaps people who want to move are unable to do so and a lot of people are still sitting on the fence			0
' @entity30 and @entity87 are now downsizing and plan to buy something smaller in the area			1
' we feel very rooted here , ' says @entity87			0
' @entity4 is very villagey and has a great sense of community			1
people tend to stay a long time			0
' who do they expect to buy the house next ? ' i 've got an image of a young family who would really enjoy being at @entity29 , ' adds @entity87			0
