a picture may say a thousand words but a picture and a tune together - well , that says at least a thousand more			1
that 's the premise behind the new @entity7 social network , hoping to overtake @entity8 in the popularity stakes			0
@entity10 , invented by 33 - year - old @entity7 marketeer @entity11 , allows users to feature a song with every image that they share , capturing the emotion behind a moment			1
the @entity10 concept is to capture the emotion behind every picture that users share to add emotion to the picture sharing experience the @entity7 social network is growing at a rate of 100,000 new sign - ups a week and so far celebrity users include @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , will.i.am , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34			1
there are also accounts for @entity36 with over 23,000 followers and @entity38 with almost 22,000 followers - although @entity10 could n't officially confirm they 're the real deal			2
at @entity42 , they take celebrity verification very seriously and request passport information before placing a little note symbol next to the username ( which means an account is verified as legit )			0
fashion brands like @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 are also getting in on the act			0
in a perfect example of how music can bring a picture to life , this weekend @entity28 posted an inspiring image of @entity59 , the youngest ever @entity61 peace prize winner , with a stirring backing track of @entity64 's @entity63			2
his previous post of an open fire pizza oven was amusingly accompanied by @entity67 by @entity68			0
the 100,000 new users a week include @entity29 ( left ) , who posted this selfie along with @entity72 's version of the @entity74 national anthem , and @entity28 ( right ) , who uploaded a picture of himself with rapper example , along with one of the rapper 's tracks @entity29 's weekend postings included an image of a lion chilling on its back along with @entity85 's @entity84			1
rather than the slew of selfies and ' i 'm having more fun than you ' snaps that dominate other social networks , @entity10 allows people to share a moment and a feeling			1
to add to the emotional @entity10 experience , when followers respond to posts , they do n't just ' like ' an image but use an ' emotion wheel ' to show if they 're ' inspired ' , ' happy ' or ' dancing ' to the post			1
founder and ceo @entity11 says it was his own picture - music - mash - up moment that inspired the idea			1
' i was walking along the @entity105 in @entity106 , i took a photograph of some autumn leaves and then i went in my @entity110 library and played @entity112 ’s @entity111			0
it was the most incredible feeling , i had goosebumps and i could n’t stop looking at the photo , ' he tells @entity115			0
' that was about three years ago and i remember thinking , " wow , imagine if you could just capture a feeling in a moment "			1
it just felt like the most natural thing in the world , ' says 33 - year - old @entity11			1
he was convinced that someone would come up with the idea - but they did n't , so he decided to create it himself			2
who has the audacity to compete with giants like @entity130 and @entity8 for a slice of the social media action ? someone who was made vice president of @entity135 aged 25 and then went onto head up @entity138 marketing , perhaps			1
left : celebrities like @entity140 are amongst users ; right : @entity142 posted this image of ( left to right ) @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 ahead of the @entity147 when @entity148 wanted to make @entity135 young and fashionable again , @entity11 was her right hand tech man			1
he was part of the team that created fashion firsts such as live - stream catwalk shows and click - and - buy catwalk technology			2
soon sir @entity154 came knocking and poached him to head up marketing for @entity138			1
inspired by his mentor sir @entity156 , @entity11 decided to set up alone and turn his @entity10 idea into reality			1
to help get the idea off the ground he set up a marketing agency , innovate7 , for a little extra cash flow , which now has @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 as clients ,			0
' i love the idea that we can redefine the way people share and discover moments of their lives			2
when you hear a song and you look at a picture you can remember how things smell it awakens all your senses			2
its like redefining the photo album and the mixtape all in one , ' he says			0
' social media allows you to travel through time in a way , as it takes you back to memories and moments – or even looking forward to something			0
' @entity10 is a place where you can capture the magic of your life and share the emotion behind that moment			1
' music is probably the most powerful way to bring all of those feelings to the surface , but there are many layers of @entity200 – whether that ’s touching the emotion wheel , or the memories that a tunepic triggers , ' he adds			2
@entity142 posted these snaps of @entity205 ( left ) and @entity206 ( right ) performing , along with tracks from their concerts so does he think his all singing all dancing version of @entity8 could overtake its big brother ? ' there are incredible social platforms out there , and i would never want to say that we ’re better or that we ’re doing something that they ca n’t do , there ’s space for everyone			0
' i think it would be arrogant for us to assume that we ’re going to be as big as them – but it ’s something that we absolutely dream of			0
i think every great idea has to start with a big ambition and a big dream			0
' we think we are building a social network for tomorrows generation – it ’s the future and it will take time but people seem to love it			0
have you ever met anyone in your life who does n’t like music ? that ’s a pretty great start point			0
' i do n’t think there ’s a single moment in my life where music is n’t relevant , and this is really about allowing people to capture that			1
' it ’s fun , it ’s simple and intuitive , ' he adds			0
@entity10 users can search from over 35 million songs to feature with their images by using keywords and they can also add an array of filters to boost photos			1
an innovative weather filter helps heighten the mood of a moment by adding sunshine , rain , snow , raindrops or a rainbow to a snap			2
with over 500 million pictures uploaded to the internet every day and over 100 million songs downloaded every week , @entity10 could be the perfect marrying of our two biggest online obsessions .			0
