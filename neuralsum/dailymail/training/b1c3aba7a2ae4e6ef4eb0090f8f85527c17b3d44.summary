@entity0 ran the show with a sensational two - goal display to fire @entity3 into the last eight			1
check out his heat map			2
it should have been an impossible act to follow but one very special young man came out to claim the grandest of all @entity10 ’s @entity9 stages as his own			1
@entity0 , 22 , @entity3 ’s £ 37.5million man , elevated himself above @entity11 as the leading scorer at @entity10 2014			1
he did so with two goals at the @entity14 , this vaulting cathedral to a game which is a religion here			2
the first was one of the most wondrously explosive to be seen at this or any major tournament ever contested			0
the second finished a dazzling movement to take his tally here to five and lead his country into a quarter - final on friday against their @entity27 hosts in @entity29			1

ratings by @entity114 at the @entity14 to come upon such a talent is as thrilling in its way as the saving of this @entity9 by the inside of a post from the last kick of the penalty shoot - out			1
this should have been an anti-climax after @entity10 ’s escape from purgatory an hour earlier			0
but at least the next @entity129 double act to come before the global audience did so in an atmosphere of enormous relief and ecstatic celebration which makes carnival in @entity135 seem like a vicarage @entity136			0
had @entity10 gone out , the neutral ramparts of the @entity14 would have been a morgue			0
the protesters would have been returning to the streets in their tens of thousands to remind this government that billions had been squandered on the football instead of the education , health and transportation of the socially deprived majority			0
victory for @entity150 would have signalled the most catastrophic turn - off in sporting history			1
instead , mercifully , attention turned to who would be next up for the hosts of the beautiful game			0
how delightful that it is to be the boys from @entity159			0
crowded out : the @entity88 wall does its job against a @entity0 free - kick flying in : @entity69 ( left ) fights for the ball with @entity88 's @entity164 fearsome : 38 - year - old @entity65 won his 101st cap in the win over @entity88 edged out : @entity97 and his team - mates endured a frustrating evening outclassed : @entity109 saw his side convincingly beaten in rio @entity0 was a 100 - 1 outsider to win the @entity57 behind more well - known players such as @entity172 and neymar.but the @entity32 midfielder struck twice in the last 16 clash with @entity88 and now has five goals in the tournament and leads the race to be the top goal @entity179 is now as short as 2 - 1 to end the @entity9 with the @entity57			1
@entity0 , who plays for @entity180 , and his pals are adding a smiling freshness of their own to the spectacle			1
they were the beauty , though we did not have the beast			0
the new firm of @entity0 , @entity189 and @entity72 were prosecuting the case for @entity3 but there was no @entity192 to protest his innocence			1
in one way he was a loss			0
how can you have heroes without a villain ? but if it was inevitable that @entity192 would succumb to his blood - lust under pressure here , better sooner than later			2
the longer this tournament goes on delivering great football , the quicker he ’ll be forgotten			0
@entity206 was always going to be hastened by the departure of his colleagues			0
@entity3 ’s youngsters had been warned to expect a rough ride from men seething with a misplaced sense of injustice			1
they braced themselves , strengthened by the knowledge that the majority of neutrals were rooting for them			0
party time : @entity32 celebrate wildly in the maracana ... and the night will be a long one in @entity159 down and out : @entity98 and @entity97 look miserable after conceding the second of the game soaking it up : @entity3 players revel in victory after reaching the last eight mr reliable : @entity228 made some solid saves whenever he was called on gutted : @entity230 of @entity88 looks dejected after being defeated by @entity3 @entity192 has darkened not only his own reputation but that of his team and his country			1
there was precious little sympathy for @entity88 as they came out of their bunker of loathing , still accusing everyone they could think of from @entity241 to the @entity243 - speaking media of persecuting their nice @entity192			1
the question was whether they would translate all that self - delusion into a singular act of vengeance			2
yet , @entity88 were pretty much on their best behaviour			1
even as the boos and jeers rained down on them from on high they concentrated on trying to play their football			0
by and large they were n’t very good at it , but players who had felt obliged to join their nation ’s rallying behind the @entity260 seemed to understand the need for some kind of redemption			0
thus it was uneventful until @entity0 struck in the 28th minute , from almost as many yards			2
he chested the ball down with back to goal , then swivelled to complete one devastatingly elegant movement with a volley which thundered down and in off the bar			2
@entity270 fought : @entity0 and @entity66 battle for a loose ball we 've done it : @entity64 shares a moment with keeper @entity228 after another late save high ball : @entity0 of @entity88 goes up for a header against @entity63 and @entity64 10 reasons why @entity279 are backing @entity3 's @entity9 bid belief surged through his team and five minutes into the second half they compiled a different kind of beauty			1
a cleverly constructed move set up @entity66 for a cross which @entity289 headed back for @entity0 to turn home with conviction			2
@entity88 are following their flawed genius home but not in quite the purdah we imagined			2
@entity3 glide on to the next , and so far greatest , challenge of their young lives .			2

@entity0 scores twice - the first a wonderful volley - to see off a @entity88
@entity3 reach the @entity9 quarter - finals for the first time in their history thanks to @entity0 's brace
@entity0 has scored in every round and heads the race to the @entity57 with five goals
