@entity0 has been treating her daughter @entity2 with medicinal marijuana for several months and has seen a dramatic improvement in her condition a @entity7 mother who was treating her two - year - old daughter with medicinal cannabis says the child has just months to live after police raided her supplier who was dobbed in to authorities by @entity16 chief minister @entity15			1
doctors told @entity0 last year that her daughter @entity2 would live only a few months as a result of @entity19 , a rare genetic condition that results in uncontrolled and violent seizures sometimes lasting up to 45 minutes , as well as a range of physical and mental disabilities			1
after months of failed treatment , and on the verge of admitting @entity25 to a palliative care unit , @entity0 bought some liquid medical marijuana from a supplier in @entity29 and snuck it into the hospital and put it into @entity2 's feeding tube			1
the result on the two - year - old 's health was extraordinary			2
' the seizures were less intense , they were n't as long and she was n't having as many of them , ' @entity0 told @entity37			2
' i started her on it without the knowledge of the staff at the hospital … they were quite surprised because they did n't know what was going on			0
the paediatrician commented on how well she was looking			0
' @entity0 describes @entity2 , who is the youngest of her six children and the only one with the rare condition , as a ' cheeky ' girl			1
' she loves cuddles and she loves music , she just loves attention			0
' but @entity0 says it is likely that @entity2 will die in the next few months , after her supply of medicinal cannabis dries up			1
@entity0 has enough medicinal cannabis to last @entity2 for six weeks and no prospect of getting more since her cannabis supplier was raided in february			1
' once [ the cannabis ] is gone the seizures will return , there 's no if and buts about it , there 's a big risk of death , ' she said			2
' i did my own research and everything was so positive			0
one of my friends was giving her child medicinal cannabis , i asked if she could recommend someone			1
' the supplier @entity0 contacted was raided earlier this year after he was dobbed in to authorities by @entity15 , @entity16 chief minister			1
the man had regularly corresponded with ms @entity15 about medicinal cannabis , but she reported him to police after he informed her he was administering marijuana to a child			1
' i felt that there was no other alternative to me but to forward that to child protection and to police , i still think that was the right thing to do despite people raising concerns about it , ' said ms @entity15			0
she added that while she had ' huge empathy ' for parents trying to find ways to alleviate the suffering of their sick children , she was required to forward on the man 's email to police and child services			0
@entity0 only has a six week supply of cannabis left and no way of getting more since her supplier was raided @entity16 chief minister @entity15 said she had ' huge empathy ' for parents wanting to treat their children , but said she was bound to report the cannabis supplier when he informed her he was supplying an illicit drug to a child ' at the end of the day i think i have to operate within the laws that are currently in operation , which are very clear regarding marijuana and also child protection			1
' ms @entity15 has received abuse and death threats on social media for the decision , with people calling her a ' robotic kid killer ' a ' hypocrite ' for whom ' evil is not a strong enough word ' and comparing her to ' @entity138 death camp guards '			0
' [ @entity15 ] would dob a homeless man into police for stealing bread cause stealing is illegal			0
antiquated dinosaur , ' wrote one person			0
but critics are not finding support from @entity0 , who said : ' i can understand where @entity15 's coming from , yet she could have had more compassion regarding the situation			1
' the 60 minutes tv program is airing a story on sunday night about the fact that @entity154 families are being left with no choice but to break the law in order to save their children , while many families in @entity161 do n’t need to go down that avenue as medicinal cannabis is legalised in some states			1
the report reveals that politicians , doctors and patients in @entity154 are shifting their thinking and there 's now a green rush to legalise cannabis for medicine nationwide			0
last week , governments in @entity7 , @entity174 and @entity175 all signalled they would support law reform which would allow chronically - ill patients to take cannabis to relieve their suffering			0
after rejecting a medicinal cannabis trial earlier this month , the @entity175 government has announced it would be prepared to support the findings of an @entity185 inquiry into medicinal cannabis			1
under a private member 's bill to be introduced this month by @entity190 mp @entity189 , terminally - ill people and their carers will be legally able to carry up to 15 grams of cannabis			0
the renewed push to relax the laws comes as a new poll reveals two thirds of @entity154 ’s support the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes			0
however , it ’s unlikely there will be any change to the legislation in @entity205 with the state government and the opposition admitting they have no immediate plans to legalise the drug			0
earlier this month , pregnant mother of one @entity211 was questioned by @entity205 police over the use of cannabis oil to treat her epileptic three - year - old son			2
clinical trials of medicinal cannabis could happen in @entity7 , but premier @entity218 is waiting on details about regulation and supply before making any commitments			1
mr @entity218 indicated his support after meeting @entity224 , a 24 - year - old who in 2010 was told he would only live for a few more months			0
the @entity226 resident began taking cannabis as a pain coping mechanism to help him deal with the disease and has made vast improvements in his health			0
@entity224 , 24 , ( pictured ) was told in 2010 that he only had months to live but began taking cannabis as a pain coping mechanism to help him deal with the disease and has made vast improvements in his health @entity175 mum @entity235 is hopeful the rising groundswell of support for the legalisation of medicinal marijuana could stop her having to obtain illegally from interstate suppliersto help the suffering of her daughter @entity242 , who is just eight			2
‘ i ’m seeing @entity249 for who she really is – i only saw glimpses of her before , ’ ms @entity235 said about the improvement of her daughter , who also suffers from @entity19 , since she started taking the liquid form of cannabis four times a day in february to help control her seizures			1
the family is one of 200 across the country who are forced to import the cannabis from a supplier in @entity258 in @entity7 which is free of charge but the waiting list is sitting at 1,500 with people desperate to get their hands on the drug to relieve chronic pain and aid with seizures			2
@entity242 when she was n't on medicinal cannabis ( left ) and since she has been taking the treatment ( right )			2

@entity0 was going to admit her daughter @entity2 to palliative care last year
@entity2 , two , suffers from @entity19 , a rare *disorder* causing violent seizures
after researching medicinal cannabis @entity0 found a supplier in @entity29 and @entity25 's condition improved dramatically
@entity0 's supplier was raided earlier this year after he was dobbed in by @entity15 , @entity16 chief minister
@entity0 fears her daughter will die after their supply runs out in six weeks
