a former @entity1 ceo who it is claimed fired @entity3 in the 1980s from the company he founded has admitted he made a mistake - and said he wished he had hired him back			1
@entity6 , who clashed with @entity3 during his ten year tenure at the tech giant , said he thought that bringing back @entity3 could have avoided the firm 's disastrous performance in the 1990s			1
' i wish in hindsight i had reached back to @entity3 and told him , ' i want to help you come back to @entity1 , '' @entity6 told @entity14			1
' i wish @entity1 had hired him back sooner rather than later			2
' @entity6 's ten - year career at @entity1 saw some of its least successful products - including an @entity22 forerunner called @entity23 - and is viewed as a decline ahead of its resurgence in recent years			1
@entity6 has previously spoken about his sometimes - fractious relationship with @entity3 , which came to a head in a dispute over the pricing of the @entity32 computer			1
@entity3 wanted it to be cheap to drive sales and interest , while @entity6 wanted to keep the price higher to protect its other products and defend the company 's bottom line			1
@entity6 , who also defended his tenure at the company , said in 2012 : ' [ @entity1 ] was the most profitable computer company in the world - not just personal computers - and @entity1 was the number one selling computer			1
' so the myth that i fired @entity3 was n't true and the myth that i destroyed @entity1 , that was n't true either			1
' @entity6 was finally forced out of @entity1 in 1993 over a dispute about licensing @entity32 's software to other pc makers			1
the board was in favour of letting other computer makers use @entity1 's software , but @entity6 was opposed			1
@entity1 did end up licensing its software , which turned out to be a major mistake			2
by the time @entity1 hired @entity3 back in 1997 , the company was posting giant losses			2
had @entity6 mended his differences with @entity3 sooner and brought him back to @entity1 during his tenure , he says the company would n't have been in such dire straits in the late 1990 's			1
' when @entity3 came back , the first thing he did was to cancel the licensing , ' @entity6 said			2
' at that point , only @entity3 could have revived the business			0
there 's no way i could have ever done the things @entity3 did			0
' @entity6 reserved his biggest compliments for current @entity1 ceo @entity72 , who @entity6 says is ' exactly the right guy ' for the job			1
' i say that without any reservation , ' @entity6 told @entity76			0
' @entity72 is doing a brilliant job			2

he allegedly signed over investments worth $ 25million to his brothers to avoid them being claimed by @entity85			0
@entity6 , who spent ten years at the helm of the tech company , finalized his divorce in 2011 , having claimed their combined worth was just $ 4.8million , @entity86 reported			2
but his ex-wife claims that he had in fact been squirreling away assets more than a decade in advance , after starting an affair with a former @entity1 colleague in 2000			0
according to filings from 2013 seen by @entity97 , @entity6 asked his brothers @entity98 and @entity99 to take on assets for him by starting a joint investment firm called @entity102 - charges @entity6 denies			2
the filing , made in @entity104 , @entity105 , in 2013 , accuses @entity6 of lying to court			0
it then alleges he ' submitted a false financial affidavit			0
and failed to fully and honestly disclose his assets			0
' those assets are later described as ' substantial private equity investments and investments in privately held companies and ventures around the globe '			0
some estimates say that @entity6 is worth as much as $ 200million in total			0
however , a representative for @entity6 refuted the claims			0
he told @entity120 : ' the reality is that this case has been in the court of law for a number of years , and leaking false items to the media in a desire to pressure mr. @entity6 into settling this case is despicable			0
' there is zero truth to these allegations			0
mr. @entity6 is confident this case will result in a full vindication for him			0
