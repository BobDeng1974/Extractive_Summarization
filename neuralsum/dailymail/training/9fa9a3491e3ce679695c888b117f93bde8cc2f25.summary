@entity0 looks ahead to @entity2 's trip to @entity3 on sunday night and their meeting with the @entity6			1
@entity6 quarterback @entity7 is just two shy of breaking @entity9 's all - time record for the most touchdown passes and will be looking to achieve that feat at @entity12 this weekend			1
the 49ers against the @entity6 is a huge game for several reasons			1
the main reason is the fact that @entity7 has the opportunity to surpass @entity9 's record for most touchdown passes thrown by a quarterback			1
at the moment @entity7 has got 506 and needs a couple more to equal the record of 508			1
but if he was to score three touchdowns on sunday night live on @entity25 , then he will become the @entity27 's all - time leading touchdown passer			1
@entity7 has an opportunity to break @entity9 's record for most touchdown passes ever on sunday @entity6 fans celebrate @entity7 's 500th touchdown pass , which he threw against @entity33 @entity7 has got a trio of exceptional receivers in tight end @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38			1
he is the leader of that offense and , if you speak to anyone who knows @entity43 over in the @entity44 , they 'll tell you that he is more like an offensive coordinator or head coach			0
he is a phenomenal @entity47 footballer , not only physically with his ability to throw the ball , but mentally that he knows the game so well			0
in my opinion , he is not the best quarterback ever			0
i think he is exceptional and one of the best we will ever see			0
but if asked me ' which quarterback would you have on their day ? ' i would pick @entity59			2
i know it is a team game and not all down to one man , but @entity59 has won three @entity62 and @entity7 has won one			1
@entity7 would definitely be in my top three , though , and the other one is @entity9			1
when @entity9 was playing , he was so devoted to the @entity65 , @entity66 and even the @entity67			2
manning needs just three more touchdown passes to break @entity9 's record for most touchdown passes the @entity6 quarterback has a number of high - class receivers , including @entity38 ( right ) the @entity75 travel to @entity12 on the back of three straight victories @entity78 at @entity79 , 6pm @entity66 at @entity80 , 6pm @entity81 at @entity82 , 6pm @entity83 at @entity84 , 6pm @entity85 at @entity65 , 6pm @entity86 at @entity87 , 6pm @entity88 at @entity89 , 6pm @entity90 at @entity91 , 6pm @entity92 at @entity93 , 6pm @entity94 at @entity95 , 9.05pm @entity96 at @entity97 , 9.25pm @entity33 at @entity98 , 9.25pm @entity2 at @entity6 , 1.30am the @entity62 defeat by the @entity100 in february is a chip on @entity7 's shoulder that will be eating him away			1
he had such a wonderful season in 2013 , but then to get absolutely destroyed the way he did against the @entity100 will not sit easily for a player like @entity7			2
the @entity100 admitted that they studied @entity7 and everything he does , even where he looks prior to the snap			2
they analysed all his physical movements , body language and just shut him down			0
it 's going to be a tough game for the @entity6 on sunday because one of the surprise packages in the @entity27 on defense this season is the 49ers secondary			1
they lost a couple of star players in the off - season but , so far , they are playing really well and are very difficult to pass against			0
this 49ers defense is quite special			1
if you look at @entity124 and @entity125 , they have got three sacks each this season			0
i have said it before and i will say it again - i think @entity125 is one of the best defensive linemen in the league			0
he is physical , he is strong , he is dominant and whoever you put in front of him is going to face a really tough test			2
@entity59 , who has won three @entity62 in @entity137 , guided the @entity138 to a 27 - 25 win over the @entity67 @entity9 , pictured in action in 1999 , won the @entity62 with the @entity65 in 1997 @entity7 leaves the field after @entity6 's @entity62 crushing by the @entity100 in february on offense , @entity2 's quarterback @entity142 is one of the most agile and mobile in the league			1
i think he is the best of this new breed of quarterbacks			0
with the read option , he does n't mind being hit or tackled , a bit like @entity152 quarterback @entity151			0
@entity142 is like a 12th man on the field because he has the capability to run down the field			2
that is something the @entity6 defense will have to adjust to			2
if @entity161 and @entity162 can contain the outside then it should be easier for the @entity6 defense to keep @entity142 in the pocket			1
but it is always difficult for teams to do that because he is such a good runner of the football			0
the 49ers have got so much talent			0
i tried to read up on what is going on in their locker room and it may just be the way coach @entity178 relays his tactics and speaks to his team			0
@entity6 duo @entity161 and @entity162 chase down @entity67 quarterback @entity181 @entity2 49ers head coach @entity178 ( right ) talks to his quarterback @entity142 @entity183 ( left ) is second on the list of most rushing yards among active players in the @entity27 there is so much talent on that team and @entity142 has thrown 10 touchdowns to six different receivers			1
you ca n't predict where he is going to throw the ball because stats show he is capable of throwing to anyone			0
they have also got @entity183 at running back , who is second on the list of most rushing yards among active players behind only @entity202			0
one thing about the @entity6 is that they always seem to start slow and then pull away			2
against the 49ers , they need to have a really good first half			0
@entity0 presents @entity27 : the @entity207 , mondays at 11.50pm on @entity25			0
this sunday night @entity25 will broadcast live coverage of the @entity75 against the @entity6 .			1

@entity6 host @entity2 49ers in sunday night game
@entity7 closing in on @entity9 's all - time touchdown record
manning is exceptional , but i would still choose @entity59 over him
49ers defense is very strong and will provide a stern test for @entity6
*broncos* must start fast and find a way to contain @entity142
