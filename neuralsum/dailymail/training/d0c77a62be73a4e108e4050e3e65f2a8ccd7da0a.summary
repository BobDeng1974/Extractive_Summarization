hosting a fundraising event for the @entity33 on tuesday , @entity6 said watching her health decline in the five years before her death was ‘ hideous ’			1
he said : ‘ my mother was what the empire was made of			1
so she was quite stoic when she was diagnosed			1
‘ but it is a pretty hideous disease			1
the last few years were hideous			1
‘ first of all , she slowed up , which i guess you are allowed to do in your early 70s			1
but it was quite dramatic			1
‘ this was a woman who was playing football with her grandchildren , reading five books a day and just on top of her game			1
‘ after we first noticed her symptoms , we spent a year and a half going to pillar to post to specialists who did n’t know enough to identify the disease			1
lord @entity6 , chairman of the @entity59 of the @entity23 ( seen here with tv presenter @entity61 ) ‘ it was a big burden on my family and on my father , who was a lot older than her and having to deal with his own frailties as well as become a full - time carer			2

he said : ‘ the @entity5 has been most days of the week including saturdays and sundays five until midnight			2
i mean five in the morning until midnight			2
‘ i have always been very good at being able to structure my time			2
my mother had a huge influence on me			2
my dad was my coach			0
he was a hugely influential figure			0
‘ but my mum was critical in getting me to recognise very early on that although what i was doing was pretty serious , quite selfish and probably to most people pretty obsessive , there actually was more to life than running quickly twice round a track			0
' @entity89 was critical in getting me to recognise very early on that although what i was doing was pretty serious ... there was actually was more to life than running quickly twice round a track			0
' above , @entity6 wins the men 's 1500m at the @entity97 in @entity98 ‘ so she sort of kept the balance there			0
’ he added : ‘ she was a fixture around running tracks			0
' whenever we were racing or training in or around @entity106 , she would end up cooking for the other athletes , including @entity108 and @entity109			0
‘ she was a massive influence on everything i did			0
’ lord @entity6 will take on another high - pressure role next month , when he is elected chairman of the @entity115			0
despite taking just a ‘ few days ’ of holiday since the @entity5 , he denied being addicted to work , saying : ‘ i do n’t think i am a workaholic			0
i prefer to keep busy			0
it is better than the alternative			0
‘ what i am really quite keen to hold on to is a little more weekend time			0
' the thing about the @entity12 is that weekends and weekdays tend to meld into one			0
