mr @entity10 said : ' i love alligators , they 're fascinating animals and i feel very privileged to work with them			1
' when i first started i was n't scared , i loved the rush and excitement of it and did n't even think of the dangers			2
' i get much more nervous doing shows now as i 'm more aware of the dangers involved			2
' during my show i try to get as close to getting bit without actually getting bitten , its about balancing the audiences need for excitement with your own need of safety			2
' we work with some very aggressive alligators at the park and if you 're not careful there 's a chance they could kill you			1
brave : mr @entity10 said : ' when i first started i was n't scared , i loved the rush and excitement of it and did n't even think of the dangers ' ' our most aggressive alligator , @entity80 is extremely dangerous			1
if he 's angry , goes into a feeding response or a death roll if he gets a hold of you , he 's going to rip off your arm			1
' once the alligator locks its jaw on you there 's no way of getting it off , they latch on and clamp onto you with such force there is no way to physically pry open the jaws by yourself			2
' i am dicing with death , i have to be very careful			2
it 's easy to become complacent when you 're working with the alligators every day			1
' but you have to remember that one of those days , that alligator could kill you			2
mr @entity105 explained that he had a call a very close call with @entity80 recently when he cornered him at the alligator park during a show			2
' he had me against a wall and he jumped up at me and tried to bite me in the head			0
if he 'd have got a hold me he 'd have caused some serious damage and possibly even killed me			0
' luckily i jumped out of the way and his jaw slammed shut less than an inch from my skin			0
' he actually grazed my shoulder with his top jaw teeth and left a nice scar to remember the moment by			0
dangerous job : during his routine the daring 24 - year - old hauls the gator from the swamp by its tail and leaps onto its back ' i pulled my shirt over the wound to cover the blood , jumped onto his back , and finished the show			2
that was a pretty hairy moment			0
' i 've been bitten during a show before , i just put my hand behind my back to hide the blood and carried on			0
mr @entity10 said he has always had an interest in animals and grew up catching lizards , snakes and turtles			1
he said : ' i kept a lot of lizards and turtles when i was younger , i was always in the wild as a child			0
