for @entity3 , their magnificent start to the season goes on			1
having won nine of their eleven games in the @entity8 so far , @entity5 's team are unbeaten and top of the table after saturday 's 2 - 1 win over @entity12 at @entity13			1
the @entity3 manager , however , believes a defeat will arrive at some time			1
asked if @entity3 could go through the season unbeaten , he said : ' no chance			1
it 's possible to be champions			2
we want to play for that			2
it 's a good start and we can keep this stability			2
' we can lose tomorrow but my team is still the same			2
one day we will lose but the next game we will win again			1
' we will play badly but we will recover our game because we are a strong team			1
we are a stable team			2
' i have been in the game so long i know the defeat will arrive and the bad moment will arrive			1
we will be ready for that			2
' we believe in everything			2
we are a happy camp			0
we believe in the players			0
' @entity5 paid tribute to midfielders @entity23 and @entity31 as both players played with injuries			1
the @entity3 manager also believes that winning goal scorer @entity55 will benefit from not playing for @entity56 over the coming international break			1
he added : ' i know every player was fantastic and some were brilliant but i give you @entity31 and @entity23 in particular			1
@entity5 was his normal animated self on the touchline at @entity13 @entity3 's players celebrate victory at @entity13 at full time @entity65 appears to use his arm to block @entity68 's effort at goal @entity68 appeals to referee @entity70 for a penalty after @entity65 's apparent block ' they both had injuries but risked everything to play and help			1
maybe i will lose them for a match or two but this game was n't in two or three weeks , it was today			2
' they put themselves there for the team like other players will do in the future because the spirit is fantastic			0
' @entity31 has been in trouble for a while but he knew we needed him			0
@entity23 put himself on the line			1
he ca n't play for @entity56			1
he can go but he will come back			0
' @entity56 have made a good decision with @entity55			1
he is in good condition now			0
when they have him again they will have a good @entity55 and not a bad @entity55			0
' @entity98 tries to clear a @entity100 effort off the line , only to see the goal awarded back in 2004 goal - line technology needed to to rule that @entity65 ( top ) had equalised for @entity3 @entity3 conceded a controversial goal at @entity13 almost ten years ago in the @entity107 , @entity100 's first - half effort being adjudged to be over line at the same end where @entity65 scored			1
@entity5 , for one , is certainly happy that technology is now available to help officials			1
' i 'm happy for everything to help , ' he said			0
' what has happened today is that everybody knows the truth			0
' it 's fantastic for the players and the crowd and the referee			0
it can be hard for him			0
without the technology it can be difficult to make a decision			0
' it 's more difficult to use for other things like penalties			0
sometimes it 's impossible for the referee to give			0
' goal - line technology is simple			2
it costs money but it 's simple			0
you do n't have to stop the game , it 's a decision in seconds			2
you ca n't put a price on the truth			0
' @entity143 can celebrates putting @entity12 ahead after nine minutes with a deflected effort @entity145 stops @entity65 's effort but the ball goes over the line to make it 1 - 1 @entity55 smashes home his 10th goal of the season to make it 2 - 1 to @entity3 after the game , @entity153 posted a picture on @entity156 of @entity3 's players celebrating on the team and is hopeful their form continues			1
' we have seen that everyone has beaten everyone , ' he said			0
' we have had a good run , hopefully we can come back from the international break and continue our form			0
we are proving hard to beat and long may that continue			0
' @entity153 conceded that @entity12 should have been awarded a penalty late on , saying : ' we have had some not go our way , it evens itself out ' .			1

@entity23 was not a 100 per cent fit for the 2 - 1 win over @entity12
@entity5 says he may now be a doubt for @entity177 game on *nov* *22*
@entity23 is part of @entity56 squad for games against @entity182 and @entity183
@entity5 says there is ' no chance ' @entity3 will go unbeaten all season
