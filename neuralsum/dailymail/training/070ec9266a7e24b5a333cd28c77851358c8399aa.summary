by @entity0 published : 10:20 est , 20 november 2013 updated : 10:44 est , 20 november 2013 the @entity1 is set to scrap its second headquarters in @entity3 in order to stop the monthly ' travelling circus ' between @entity6 and @entity7			1
the move , warranted by the four - day sessions in @entity3 every month costs 200 million euros a year			1
with continent - wide recessions and economic struggle , @entity11 leaders are looking to put and end to the vast cost of having two parliamentary bases and use @entity7 , the @entity11 's main seat , as the sole headquarters			2
the @entity1 is set to scrap its second headquarters in @entity3 , pictured , in order to save up to 215 million euros per year in travel an maintenance the move would not only save hundreds of millions in travel but also an additional 12 million spent on maintenance for the @entity3 building which is empty for 300 days of the year			1
however @entity6 is expected to veto the decision when it is taken before national leaders in an attempt to maintain its position as a ' founding state '			0
as it stands , @entity11 law says that the parliament , the only elected body among the @entity11 's institutions and one of increasing clout , must have a four - day session once a month in @entity3			1
that entails 766 members and their staff moving 430 kilometres ( 270 miles ) from @entity42 to the eastern @entity6 city , which is actually closer to @entity44 than to @entity7			0
@entity45 of parliamentary documents must also be shifted and a large number of reporters and lobbyists also have to tag along			0
expensive circus : each month the entire @entity1 moved from @entity7 to @entity3 , pictured , for four - day sessions before moving back again - incurring hundreds of millions in costs per year the monthly move is estimated to cost between 156 million and 204 million euros ( $ 275 million ) a year , but also has an environmental impact that @entity55 and many others find unacceptable at a time of heightened climate awareness			1
roughly 2,400 parliament staff also work in @entity60			0
since the @entity11 's @entity62 treaty came into force in 2009 - giving the @entity1 new powers - a growing number of @entity55 have campaigned against the costly set - up , with the most vocal opponent @entity68 's @entity67			2
‘ over 75 percent of lawmakers want to end the costly and inefficient monthly , four - day trek to @entity3 from our home in the political capital of the @entity11 , ’ said @entity67 , a @entity69			1
@entity6 , however , has defended its right to host the assembly and all the business it brings			0
in the latest of several rulings in @entity6 's favour , the @entity78 last year annulled a @entity1 decision to reduce the number of sessions in @entity3 , saying it is for @entity11 governments to decide changes			1
@entity11 governments must all agree on granting a single seat to the parliament , effectively giving @entity6 a veto on any campaign seeking to put an end to the two - seat arrangement			0
lawmakers still hope to garner enough public support to eventually pressure @entity6 to give in , building on a 2006 petition that was endorsed by more than 1 million @entity11 citizens			0
@entity11 lawmakers argue the parliament has undergone a transformation since it was created as an assembly in 1952 , moving from a consultative body without the power to propose legislation to a house representing a 28 - nation bloc of 500 million and co-legislating with governments			2
‘ the travelling circus between difference workplaces leads to unjustifiable costs and environmental damage that can no longer be explained to the public , ’ @entity106 's @entity105 ( @entity107 ) said in a statement .			0

@entity1 have a four - day session once a month in @entity3
monthly move costs between 150 and 200 million euros every year
