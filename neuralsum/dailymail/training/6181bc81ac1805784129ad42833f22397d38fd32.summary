by @entity0 a @entity2 air stewardess has finally welcomed home her three adopted daughters seven years after she first met the girls in a @entity7 orphanage			1
@entity8 met her daughters in 2008 , but when the @entity7 government cut back on foreign adoptions the family were left in legal limbo			1
it took seven years , 30 trips abroad and a lot of help from senator @entity18 before officials finally allowed ms @entity8 to take the three sisters home last week			1
' i still feel like this is so surreal			2
i mean , i just have to pinch myself			0
when they come in , in the morning and crawl in bed with me			0
i just have goose bumps thinking about it , ' she told @entity34			0
when she first met the children , @entity35 and @entity36 were one - year - olds and their sister @entity40 was a newborn			0
' i just fell in love with them as soon as i saw them			0
i just thought morally , i just ca n't let them go , ' ms @entity8 , who is not married and found the girls through a church adoption group , said			1
the adoption agency ms @entity8 had used estimated that within six to nine months the paperwork would be completed and the girls would be with her in @entity49 , @entity50			1
but the process was massively delayed as developing countries including @entity7 started to restrict foreign adoptions while they tackled problems with fraud and child trafficking			1
family : @entity59 and @entity36 were a year old and their little sister @entity40 was a newborn when @entity8 first met them growing up : by the time the sisters finally arrived at their new home the twins were 8 and @entity40 was 7 in november 2007 , her adoption case was put on hold during a country - wide investigation , and it looked as though she may lose her children			1
while the case was being slowly processed the three sisters were moved between several orphanages and foster homes			2
the constant moving made it hard for ms @entity8 to keep track of them , and also meant that the girls have not had any formal education			2
' they needed a permanent home , ' ms @entity18 , who met @entity7 officials on ms @entity8 ' behalf , said			1
settling in : after living in several orphanages the sisters finally have a permanent place to call home ' it took a little time , but they got to the right place and allowed these children to be adopted			2
' she added : ' a lot of times when you personally meet with the ambassador like i did and you tell the story of these three little girls and this mother who has been trying for seven years , they listen			0
' although the girls , now aged eight and seven , speak only a little @entity103 , they are settling into their new home well			0
they will start school in a couple of weeks and attend summer classes to help them catch up with their new classmates .			0
