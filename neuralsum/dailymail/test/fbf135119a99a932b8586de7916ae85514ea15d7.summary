@entity0 insisted on saturday that @entity1 does not deserve to be ranked alongside @entity2 as the leading fighters of their generation as the two boxers put the finishing touches to their preparations for the @entity9 in @entity10 a week on saturday			1
@entity0 , @entity2 ’s trainer , said he rated super-middleweight star @entity11 and middleweight sensation @entity12 above @entity1 despite the @entity14 ’s unbeaten record and his status as hot favourite for the may 2 showdown against @entity2			1
‘ @entity1 is undefeated so you have to give him a little credit for that , ’ said @entity0 , ‘ but he has picked and chosen his opponents and i do n’t think he ’s fought enough competition to be considered the best			1
you have to fight the best to be the best , i feel			2
he ’s ducked a lot of guys			2
@entity2 's trainer @entity0 says that @entity1 can not be considered best ever @entity0 says that @entity1 has picked and chosen his fights during his career ‘ @entity2 has had some devastating losses in his career but he is a realist			1
he understands that losing is part of the game and if you do n’t think you are going to get knocked out in this sport , you have picked the wrong sport			2
i ’d put @entity11 and @entity35 above @entity1 right now			1
they are very talented guys and very polished boxers			0
’ @entity0 has been vocal in an otherwise low - key and surprisingly respectful build - up to the welterweight showdown next month and knows that his tactics have made the stakes even higher for him			1
but he is adamant @entity2 will spring a surprise in the most eagerly awaited fight for years			1
‘ the fight will be won and lost on the ropes , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ if @entity1 goes to the ropes and tries to rest his legs , he will get beat			1
if he has good movement the entire night and his legs do n’t give out on him , he ’ll probably win			0
it ’s about outscoring him			0
if he sits on the ropes , we can outscore him			0
if he stays in the middle of the ring and boxes all the time he could possibly outscore us			0
’ @entity0 claimed @entity2 is in the best shape of his life , moving faster and punching harder than ever before			1
‘ he trains harder than any fighter i have ever had in my life , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i have had 33 world champions and nobody can touch him for his work ethic			0
‘ this fight can send out a message about what we need to do in boxing			2
when the best fights the best , do you see how big this is ? someone needs to wake up and put the best with the best all the time			0
because when that happens , we have the best sport in the world			0
i do n’t care who likes who , you can still negotiate business			0
@entity0 rates super middleweight @entity11 higher than he does undefeated @entity1 @entity0 , who has trained @entity2 for 15 years , says the @entity78 is in the best shape of his life ‘ it ’s a better fight today than it was five years ago because they were both a lot faster and more mobile five years ago and it might have been more of a boxing match but now they ’re a little bit older , it ’s going to be a better fight			1
‘ i believe @entity2 can win this fight			1
i kind of have to win this fight			2
i ’ve been talking a lot			0
it ’s more important than anything to me			0
it ’s more important to me than getting my girlfriend , @entity87 , back			0
it ’s that big because , i mean , i really like this girl			0
‘ my mother told me , “ you must like her ; you put her christmas tree up for her , you bought her a car and those earrings you bought her cost £ 14,000 each ”			0
‘ after this fight maybe i ’ll try to get her back			2
