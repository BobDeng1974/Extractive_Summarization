many of us may not have the billionaire lifestyle or scientific prowess of @entity5 's @entity4 , but we can now at least get his trademark hi - tech gloves at home			1
laser expert @entity8 created a working @entity4 - style arm and hand that fires beams from the back of the wrist or from the wearer 's palm			1
and in a video , the contraption is shown popping balloons and lighting matches from feet away			1
he posts videos to @entity31 as @entity32			0
his laser gloves and @entity35 / @entity34 are available to order in varying wavelengths			0
earlier this year , mr @entity8 built a laser weapon , inspired by the @entity39 gun			1
the gun is made from aluminium and shoots rounds of 1.4 - watt @entity44 blue lasers			0
the inventor said , although it is only strong enough to pop balloons , it is still too dangerous to be used outside a video shows the rapid - fire weapon popping 26 balloons mounted on a wall			1
eight aa batteries power the laser motor and the gun 's turret is powered by four ball bearings controlled by a mechanism under the gun			2
as the barrel spins , the lasers - powered by lithium - ion batteries - are shot out			1
these range from the blue 405nm - type laser model to one fitted with 445nm , or 650nm			2
he also offers a ' low power green ' version on his website			0
the gadgets are powered by lithium - ion cells and output ranges between @entity71 and @entity72			1
the @entity74 can be fired continuously for up to three minutes before the batteries need to be replaced and can be made for either the left or right hand , or both			0
he has previously built a @entity81 - style web shooter and @entity83 laser glasses			1
other inventions include the @entity86 - inspired @entity85 , consisting of a metal case , screws , and a built - in laser pointer			2
the rechargeable watch has an led watch module and 1,500 - milliwatt laser			2
earlier this year , the same @entity94 inventor built a laser weapon , inspired by the @entity39 gun			2
the gun is made from aluminium and shoots rounds of 1.4 - watt @entity44 blue lasers			0
the inventor said that although it is only strong enough to pop balloons , it is still too dangerous to be used outside			0
a video shows the rapid - fire weapon popping 26 balloons mounted on a wall			1
the gadget ( pictured ) is powered by lithium - ion cells and output ranges between @entity71 and @entity72			1
the @entity74 can be fired continuously for up to three minutes before the batteries need to be replaced and it can be made for either the left or right hand , or both the glove was inspired by @entity4 , also known as @entity4 , played by @entity116 ( pictured ) eight aa batteries power the laser motor and the gun 's turret is powered by four ball bearings controlled by a mechanism under the gun			1
as the barrel spins , the lasers - powered by lithium - ion batteries - are shot out			1
the inventor is obviously fearful his designs will fall into the wrong hands , too , as he states on his website : ' no plans , no schematics , no blueprints '			0
the laser weapon is a taken on the iconic @entity39 gun invented by @entity136 in the 1860s			0
mr @entity8 previously built a @entity81 - style web shooter and @entity83 laser glasses			1
other inventions include the @entity86 - inspired @entity85 , consisting of a metal case , screws , and built - in laser pointer ( shown ) mr @entity8 admitted the watch was a ‘ pain in the a ’ to make because of all the tiny parts , and the total watch took him around 40 hours to complete			1
the watch is pictured popping balloons on a wall the laser watch was inspired by 1964 @entity86 film @entity152			1
in this scene , @entity154 ( played by @entity155 ) ties @entity86 ( @entity157 ) to a table and threatens to cut him using the laser pointer ( pictured ) in a video for reactions , the @entity160 took a look at the science of @entity5 's @entity165			2
@entity4 's original suit , made only of iron , would have weighed around 70kg ( 150lbs ) according to the @entity160 - not very comfortable or easy to move around in			1
he later upgrades it to a gold - titanium alloy , but that would actually make things worse explained the video			0
‘ that suit would probably weigh around 160kg ( 350lbs ) , which might work for the @entity174 but not for @entity4 , ’ said the narrator			0
however , dr @entity175 continued that it is later made of a nickel - titanium alloy called nitinol			0
the @entity160 in @entity179 recently explained the science behind the @entity165 in a video			0
it looked at the composition of @entity4 's suit - said to be a gold - titanium alloy in one of the movies - and @entity185 's shield			2
the video also explained the science behind super-healing abilities this is ‘ strong but light , and can be reformed after taking damage , ’ she said			0
‘ there may also be some graphite reinforced with carbon fibre , which can take a lot of heat - useful if @entity4 does n’t want to singe his feet using those rocket boots			2
’ none of this would work , though , without @entity4 ’s own portable nuclear power station - the @entity205			2
in @entity207 this uses palladium - but we soon learn this is poisoning and killing the character			0
so instead , he creates a new element - and dr @entity175 said this might not be as far - fetched as it seems			0
he uses his own particle accelerator to smash the nuclei of atoms together and make a new type of atom , which is not entirely dissimilar to the experiments taking place at real - life accelerators such as @entity224 .			0

@entity4 - style arm and hand was built by laser expert @entity8

gadget is powered by lithium - ion cells and can be ordered from mr @entity8
