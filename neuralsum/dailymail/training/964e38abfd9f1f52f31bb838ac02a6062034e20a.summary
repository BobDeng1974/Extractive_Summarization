officers were alerted by staff on saturday to new allegations of tampering at the hospital their investigation comes as officers seek to find out who is behind the tampering of saline drips , which resulted in three patients dying and affecting up to 40 others			1
victims @entity40 , 44 , @entity41 , 71 , and @entity42 , 83 , had unlawfully been given insulin			0
but the hospital tried to reassure patients and their families that there was nothing to suggest the two alarming incidents are related			0
a spokesman for @entity4 said : ' we can confirm that an incident relating to the possible contamination of a small quantity of milk took place			1
' the police have been informed and the hospital is helping them with their inquiries			1
' there was no lasting effect for the one patient who tasted a very small amount			1
' a @entity23 spokesman said : ' @entity23 are now investigating this incident but there is nothing at this stage to suggest this is in any way linked to the wider police inquiry currently ongoing at the hospital			2
the deaths of ( from left ) @entity40 , 44 , @entity41 , 71 , and @entity42 , 83 , at @entity4 are still under investigation ' @entity4 is made up of a large community of people and it is unlikely that every incident reported is connected to the concerted and deliberate criminality already being investigated			1
' detectives investigating the tampering of saline solution at the hospital said today that four additional deaths referred to them have been ruled out of their inquiries			1
they revealed that the cases were passed on to them by the coroner when it was announced that all charges in connection with the inquiry had been dropped against nurse @entity92			0
however , police - who have described the investigation as something out of @entity97 - said they are continuing to look at the suspicious deaths of the trio			2
nurse @entity92 was initially arrested as part of the investigation but has since been cleared of all charges a spokesman for @entity23 said : ' we can confirm that the deaths of @entity41 , @entity40 and @entity42 have undergone this same process of review and we can confirm these people have been unlawfully administered insulin			2
' however , we have yet to establish if this has been a significant contributing factor to each of their deaths			2
a number of toxicology and other tests to try and establish causes of death are continuing and may take some weeks to complete			0
' two other patients at the hospital - @entity118 and @entity120 , both aged 84 - were also linked to the inquiry but their deaths were earlier ruled out as not suspicious			1
assistant chief constable @entity122 said : ' the decision to rule out the deaths of these six people ( including @entity118 and @entity120 ) will provide their families with some level of reassurance			2
' they will now be able to continue grieving for their loved ones in the knowledge that they have not been taken from them in suspicious circumstances			0
' i know relatives of the confirmed victims affected and the public in general will be anxious and want answers and we are working as quickly as we can without jeopardising the quality or integrity of the investigation			0
' this is an exceptionally complex and difficult process and one that can not be rushed or completed quickly			0
' should we identify any further deaths that will be investigated by us as part of this investigation , we will , of course , make the relevant announcement once we have spoken to family members			0
' he added that his detectives were presently looking at 30 potential victims of the saline contamination , including ms @entity40 , mr @entity41 and mr @entity42			0
more than 300 people have now been interviewed out of a pool of around 700 - consisting of staff , patients and visitors - who could could have had access to the area during the time the tampering may have taken place .			0
