senate majority leader @entity0 shocked @entity1 by withdrawing support for president @entity4 's minimum wage proposal on tuesday , showing that @entity5 are getting cold feet following a devastating report that predicted massive job losses if the wage floor were to rise			1
but while the @entity11 leader has withdraw the measure from the @entity14 calendar , leading liberals in the @entity16 are preparing an attempt to force a minimum wage vote over the objections of house speaker @entity20 and conservative @entity21			1
raising the minimum wage was expected to be the centerpiece of the @entity4 administration 's 2014 agenda , and @entity27 surrogates planned just a week ago to spend the last days of february arguing in favor of the initiative			1
but @entity0 and @entity4 hit a roadblock on feb. 18 when the nonpartisan @entity31 released a report predicting a loss of 500,000 jobs by 2016 as a consequence of a $ 10.10 minimum wage			1
senate majority leader @entity0 yanked the president 's national minimum wage proposal from the @entity14 calendar this week , admitting defeat -- at least for now executive action : president @entity4 went around @entity42 on feb. 12 to sign an order raising the minimum wage to $ 10.10 for employees of federal contractors , but he 's powerless to do more without backing from lawmakers combined with a labor participation rate at its lowest point since 1978 , @entity49 insiders say the news made all momentum vanish			1
' @entity0 simply ca n't move forward with this idea unless he wants to surrender the @entity14 in november , ' a senior aide to a @entity14 @entity21 told @entity56 on wednesday			2
' there 's just no way he 's going to go down in history as a greater job - killer than he already is			0
' @entity5 already run the risk of losing control of the @entity14 this year , with some prognosticators saying @entity21 will pick up as many as 10 seats , more than the six they need in order to return in 2015 as the majority			1
that scenario would put all of @entity42 in @entity21 hands , turning president @entity4 into an instant lame duck and killing his chances of passing legacy - building legislation during his final two years in office			0
labor unions have lobbied for years to raise the current minimum of $ 7.25 per hour , arguing that a full - time job at that wage puts most earners below the federal government 's poverty line			1
but academic research shows that most minimum wage earners are not heads of households , and few earn the minimum for very long			2
labor unions have organized strikes and demonstrations in @entity90 cities , demanding higher wages for service industry workers , farmhands and other low - paid employees in addition , many organized labor contracts include scores of higher salaries that are indexed to the minimum wage , meaning that they would also rise – winning union leaders plaudits from the rank and file and greater legitimacy at a time when private - sector union membership has dwindled to just 6.7 per cent			2
only 32 of the @entity14 's 55 democrats have signed on to sen. @entity108 's bill , written to carry the president 's minimum wage agenda			1
pressing the issue : @entity16 minority leader @entity112 plans a maneuver to force a minimum wage vote on the @entity16 floor , but needs at least 18 republicans to support her and most democrats who have backed away from @entity0 are facing difficult re-election bids , @entity117 reported on wednesday			1
those vulnerable senators include @entity122 of @entity123 , @entity124 of @entity125 and @entity126 of @entity127			0
the sole liberal contrarian is sen. @entity129 , a red - state @entity130 from @entity132 who leads in the polls but expects a tough fight in november			0
@entity129 , however , has already distanced himself from president @entity4			0
on jan. 29 he told @entity136 that he 's ' not really interested ' in having the president campaign for him			0
' i do n't need him campaigning for me , ' he said			0
' i need him to change some of his policies			0
' @entity21 have jumped on the feb. 18 report as new ammunition in the national fight over jobs , already tilting in their favor because of another @entity31 report that predicted that the @entity146 would trim the equivalent of millions of full - time jobs from the @entity90 economy			1
' you couple that with @entity31 ’s estimate of 2.3 million fewer jobs created under @entity146 and you ’ve got a pretty big hit on an economy that is already suffering from way too much joblessness , ' senate minority leader @entity150 said on tuesday of the minimum wage report			1
' the last thing we need to be doing right now in our country is passing legislation that destroys even more jobs			0
' @entity165 chairman @entity164 told reporters during a hastily planned feb. 18 conference call that employers dissatisfied with a new minimum wage did n't necessarily need to trim jobs			2
instead of eliminating positions in the face of a static salary pool , he argued , company owners should take into account ' the overall benefits for productivity , plus the other margins on which firms can adjust – for example , reduced profits			0
' the wrath of @entity20 : speaker @entity20 would not look kindly on @entity21 who cross the aisle to support a ' discharge petition ' that would overrule him and put @entity4 's minimum wage legislation up for a vote the @entity31 found that as many as 1 million jobs might be lost after a minimum wage hike to $ 10.10 per hour , but determined that its ' central estimate ' was 500,000 jobs @entity0 is putting on a brave face , vowing to bring the bill back in november – perhaps in a lame duck session after the fall election – if members of his own party keep balking			1
but while senators in job - protection mode dither , @entity16 @entity5 led by minority leader @entity112 are planning an unusual maneuver to force a minimum wage vote			1
@entity20 has said he wo n't bring the bill to the floor because fewer than half of the @entity21 in his caucus want it			2
but @entity5 , betting that enough in the @entity21 would favor a vote , are preparing a ' discharge petition			1
' that measure would force a floor vote if at least 218 of the 435 @entity16 members supported it			2
with 199 @entity5 already locked in , 18 republicans would have to join them			0
while there are likely at least that many who would feel pressure from their constituents to vote in favor of a final bill , any @entity21 who supports a @entity11 discharge position would risk the wrath of @entity20 , whose power extends to crucial fundraising help and committee assignments			2
' it 's a nonstarter , ' a @entity16 aide told @entity56 , ' asking for anonymity			0
' if @entity112 wants to force the issue she 's going to be sorely disappointed			0
' ' it will keep the minimum wage in the news for a bit longer , though			0

the majority leader *quietly* pulled the president 's minimum wage bill from the @entity14 calendar on tuesday
action followed a *scathing* @entity31 report predicting the loss of 500,000 jobs if the wage floor rises to $ 10.10 per hour
vulnerable @entity5 have shied away from the proposal , choosing to protect their re-election chance in november
@entity16 @entity5 , meanwhile , are preparing a ' discharge petition ' intended to force @entity21 leaders to bring a minimum wage hike up for a vote
the @entity27 has *insisted* job losses need not follow a wage hike , saying companies can fall back on ' reduced profits ' to make up the costs
