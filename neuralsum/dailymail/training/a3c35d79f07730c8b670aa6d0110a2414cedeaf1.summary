@entity92 international @entity86 ( centre ) celebrates scoring the winner for @entity88 with a fine strike @entity87 - @entity104 ( @entity12 vs @entity29 ) - 7.5 @entity30 at @entity31 @entity104 offered his own thoughtful , considered approach			0

@entity16 salutes the @entity31 faithful after his 55th minute strike put @entity12 firmly in control @entity87 - @entity114 ( @entity7 vs @entity115 ) - 8 @entity116 at the @entity117 stood up to be counted in the absence of @entity7 's usual marksmen			1
