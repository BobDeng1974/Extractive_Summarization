with a sad shake of the head , @entity0 laments that the foreign legion has taken over @entity5 football			1
in his own @entity11 ' heyday — up front alongside @entity7 — the talk on @entity9 was very much centred on ' the @entity12 '			0
the goals of @entity14 and @entity7 , quickly earning them that tag , ultimately captured the league flag for @entity17 's @entity11 in 1994 - 1995 , their first title win in 81 years			1
@entity0 ( right ) , pictured holding the @entity20 trophy with @entity7 , believes there are too many foreign players in @entity24 's top - flight but the @entity5 top - flight scene of 2014 is now all about @entity27 's @entity26 at @entity28 , @entity31 's @entity30 @entity29 and @entity32 of @entity33 and @entity34			1
and @entity14 believes an over reliance on foreign recruits has driven down the standard of local players , rendering this @entity24 side ' underwhelming '			1
a lacerating pitch - side pundit with @entity41 , @entity14 is unconvinced by goalkeeper @entity42 and defender @entity43			1
he also thinks midfielder @entity44 is no @entity45 or @entity46			0
ultimately , though , @entity14 blames the @entity20 and its obsession with overseas talent for the roar of the @entity24 being replaced by a whimper			1
@entity14 is unconvinced that @entity43 ( right ) is good enough to play international football ' @entity5 football is a great watch , it 's box office — but it 's not @entity5 players we are raving about , ' said former @entity55 , @entity28 and @entity56 striker @entity14 , who picked up just one cap for @entity24			1
' on a saturday night , when people watch @entity9 , they talk about @entity26			2
you do n't hear them talking about @entity5 players and i think that is a big problem			0
' @entity5 players are finding it harder to get their chance and that has an effect on the national team			0
' people talk about changing the manager but @entity73 can only work with what is available to him			2
' i do n't think there are enough good @entity5 players and the current @entity24 team is underwhelming			2
' they have issues all over the pitch			0
at the back , i think @entity42 is under pressure			0
i like @entity82 and i think he deserves an opportunity			0
ex-chelsea striker @entity14 thinks it 's a shame that people talk about @entity26 ( right ) and not @entity5 players ' there are also problems at centre - half			1
i do n't believe @entity43 is good enough to play international football			0
' in midfield , they are toying with players to replace @entity45 and @entity46 and bringing in the likes of @entity44 who , to me , is n't an @entity24 player			2
' up front , i still like @entity98			0
i think he has a big effect on the team and that he gets unfair criticism			0
but they need to get @entity104 fit			0
' @entity24 have a lot to do			1
i do n't think they are up with the best teams in the world , not by a long shot			0
' in @entity109 last summer , @entity24 's endured their worst - ever @entity110 , finishing bottom of a group that included @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115			1
under @entity73 , they have won four out of four in an admittedly weak qualifying group and are on the brink of reaching @entity118 2016 in double - quick time			2
@entity14 , pictured during his time as @entity123 manager , believes @entity24 are n't up there with the world 's best but major finals are where @entity24 are judged and @entity14 wants affirmative action in their @entity20 to help restore the national team 's fortunes			1
' at the @entity110 , there was all this stuff about @entity24 in the group of death but i still expected them to qualify			2
' you must hit the ground running in big tournaments			0
@entity24 did n't and it cost them			2
' @entity138 at the @entity139 is trying to sort things out at grass - roots level			0
he gets criticised but at least he is trying to do something about it			0
' but , until there 's a bigger quota of @entity5 players in club sides , it will keep affecting the national team			0
@entity44 ( right ) is n't good enough to replace @entity46 or @entity45 , according to @entity14 ' when clubs name a 25 - man squad , around half should be @entity153			1
that 's the sensible way to address things — but it is n't being addressed			0
' it is against that bleak backdrop that @entity14 believes an @entity24 defeat to @entity159 tonight would represent ' a disaster ' — but ' no surprise '			1
he said : ' this game has more significance for @entity24 than it does for @entity159			1
' i think @entity5 people would expect @entity24 to win but i 'm not so sure they will			2
@entity159 have momentum and are playing with confidence			1
' @entity169 expecting fiery atmosphere in @entity159 @entity0 is a member of the @entity171 of which the @entity172 , @entity173 , is a corporate partner .			1

@entity24 face @entity159 in a *friendly* at @entity177 on *tuesday* night
@entity0 believes that there are too many foreigners playing in the @entity20
the @entity183 striker says the @entity24 have a lot of work to do
clubs should be forced to have half - @entity153 squads , according to @entity14
