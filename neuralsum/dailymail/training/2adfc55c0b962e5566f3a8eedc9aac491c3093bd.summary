by @entity0 moving hospital beds further apart and having fewer patients on wards will prevent the spread of a new breed of superbugs , say experts			1
there should also be large windows for better air circulation as part of a ‘ @entity13 - style makeover ’ to help cut the risk of infection			1
scientists said such measures would buy medics crucial time as they attempt to develop new cures for antibiotic - resistant superbugs			2
hospital beds should be moved further apart to help stop infection in hospitals , say experts ( file picture ) last month the @entity27 warned that the threat was so high patients may soon die from scratches or grazes that become infected			1
professor @entity33 , from @entity34 , told the @entity35 : ' we are talking about returning hospital wards to the type we had 100 years ago			1
‘ in the near future it is possible that a scratch from a rose thorn could become septic			0
‘ without effective antibiotics , septicaemia could easily set in and result in death			0
’ addressing a meeting of the @entity35 in @entity48 last week , which was attended by @entity49 , the chief medical officer , he added : ‘ it is a terrible prospect , but a very real one			2
scientists said such measures would buy medics crucial time as they attempt to develop new cures for antibiotic - resistant superbugs ( file picture ) ‘ we are facing a return to the state of affairs that existed before antibiotics were discovered			1
’ the problem has been caused by the widespread use of antibiotics by doctors – and farmers on livestock - which has led to bacteria evolving so they are immune			0
at the same time , drug companies have developed fewer , new antiobiotics as they are not as profitable as more expensive treatments for diabetes and high blood pressure , for example			0
professor @entity72 , from @entity73 , @entity48 , called on hospitals to employ ‘ old school ’ measures , adding : ‘ we need to hold back the spread of resistant bacteria while finding ways to persuade pharmaceuticals to improve their output of new generations of antibiotics			2
’ although rates of @entity85 and @entity86 in hospitals are at record lows , scientists are deeply concerned about a new breed of antibiotic - resistant superbugs that includes strains of @entity91			1
last month dr @entity92 , assistant director for health security at the @entity27 said : ‘ the world is headed for a post-antibiotic era , in which common infections and minor injuries which have been treatable for decades can once again kill			2
‘ we should anticipate to see many more deaths			0
’ ‘ we are going to see people who have untreatable infections , we cant do anything about them			0
or there will be people who will be treatable but it will take much longer to treat them			0

experts say the steps will prevent the spread of a new breed of superbugs
added that there should be a return to ' @entity13 style ' hospital wards
