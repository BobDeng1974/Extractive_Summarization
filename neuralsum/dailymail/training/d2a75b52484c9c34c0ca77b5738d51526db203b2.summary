data project to harvest confidential information from patients ’ medical files			1
personal details are being posted on @entity47 , emailed to strangers and dumped by the side of the road @entity4 officials are about to begin a pilot project across 265 gp surgeries which involves uploading information from patients medical file onto a computer database			1
eventually it will be rolled out across the country and unless patients object in writing or in person , their data will be automatically harvested			2
@entity4 officials say the @entity91 scheme will unlock a wealth of information that will help expose poor care – such as long waiting times – and may even unlock new treatments			0
but campaigners say the data will be shared too easily with private companies such as insurance firms who could use it to hike up premiums			0
@entity104 , director of @entity30 , said : ‘ the information held in medical records is of huge personal significance and for details to be wrongly disclosed , maliciously accessed or lost is completely unacceptable			1
‘ with an increasing number of people having access to patients ’ information , the threat of data breaches will only get worse			2
‘ urgent action is therefore needed to ensure that medical records are kept safe and the worst data breaches are taken seriously			2
‘ if the government wants to introduce new schemes which will make the public ’s data more accessible , then this must go hand in hand with greater penalties for those who abuse that access			0
‘ this should include the threat of jail time and a criminal record			0
’ yesterday ministers announced they had appointed the first national data guardian tasked with ensuring patients ’ privacy is not breached			2
dame @entity136 will oversee how patients data is used and intervene if there is any cause for concern			0
she has previously written two reports about the benefits of using potentially valuable information whilst maintaining patients trust			0
the government was forced to delay the @entity91 scheme in february following mounting concerns by doctors that patients had been left in the dark			0
it is now being cautiously re-introduced while officials try and make patients aware of what will happen with their records and how to opt out			0
and yesterday ministers promised to give patients better access to their own records enabling them to view test results and order repeat prescriptions on smart phones and laptops			0
health secretary @entity166 pledged that by 2018 , patients will see their entire medical history at the click of a computer button			0
eventually ministers hope that patients will be able to download test results and scans without having to book appointments at surgeries or hospitals			0
@entity177 , of the campaign group @entity179 said : ‘ the @entity91 debacle has shown the serious consequences when proper governance is ignored , or only bolted on once things have already collapsed			1
‘ meaningful sanctions would show these toxic breaches are being taken seriously , but to rebuild trust requires that every patient knows where their information has gone , and why			0
