' we have seen gangs from other areas such as east @entity17 who have been looking at the estate to see if there is scope to move in , so there could be a power struggle			0
' there 's a couple more who we are after who are on a middle level , who are out of our sphere , but we are confident we have got the right people this morning , no problem at all			2
' ' we have unusual gangsters here , they tend to wear school uniforms and ride a bike			0
