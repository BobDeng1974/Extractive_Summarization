' i thought it was nothing serious at first and i told him i would get him some paracetamol but then he got poorly very quickly			0
' initially he was saying " my head hurts , my head hurts " , then he started being sick			0
' his eyes were going back and forward and he was rolling around in pain			0
' he could n’t work his hands			0
' i gave him a glass of water but he threw it over himself as he was so hot			0
' he was so hot i could n’t touch him , then he started to fit			2

the collection raised more than £ 500 and the charity paid tribute to mr @entity0 by presenting a series of prizes in his honour at its annual @entity122 celebration			2
because of the violent nature of a sneeze and the strain it puts on the human body , people can die from a sneeze that triggers a pre-existing condition - such as a blood clot or a fracture			2
however , they can also die from the pressure that builds up in the brain , with no pre-existing conditions , although these cases are incredibly rare			2
one of the only other documented cases happened when a @entity138 father died in 2009 from haemorrhage and a heart attack caused by a violent and heavy sneeze			2
his sneeze caused a subdural haematoma - trauma to the brain , but doctors detected no fractures or trauma caused the sneeze to be worse .			0
