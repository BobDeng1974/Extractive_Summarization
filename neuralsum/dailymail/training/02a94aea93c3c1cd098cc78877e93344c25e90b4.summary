@entity0 scored either side of half - time to lift @entity3 back into contention in @entity5 and see off @entity6			1
@entity7 had given the @entity8 the lead in @entity10 with his country 's first @entity12 goal since 1982			1
but @entity14 responded with a quick equaliser before heading home the winner in the second half			1
relive all the action as it happened below			0
click here for @entity22 's brilliant @entity12 @entity21 @entity6 : @entity23 @entity3 : @entity23 host commentator this match promised little , but delivered a lot			1
it was certainly entertaining , fast and physical ... if not one for the purists			0
you can read @entity32 's take on proceedings with our match report @entity36			0
@entity37 will be here tomorrow for @entity40 v @entity39 at 5pm , and i 'll be back for the two late games @entity43 v @entity44 at 8pm and @entity47 v @entity45 at 11pm			2
in the meantime , adios			0
@entity3 come from behind to get the three points and rise to second place in @entity5 ahead of @entity53 on goal difference			1
@entity0 was the man who made the difference , scoring either side of half - time in @entity10			1
@entity3 play @entity58 in their final group game at the @entity61 on wednesday while @entity6 must beat @entity53 to stand any chance of progression			1
changes galore as @entity3 throw on @entity65 and the experiences @entity67 in an attempt to see this out			1
honduras have brought on @entity71 in an attempt to force an equaliser			2
just six minutes to go and i would n't bet my house on this finishing 2 - 1 , it 's still very open in @entity10			1
honduras throw on @entity79 in an attempt to get back into this game			0
@entity82 is the man who makes way			0
a defeat would not be the end of the road for @entity6 , but they would need a healthy win over @entity53 and hope @entity58 beat @entity3 on wednesday			1
still 20 minutes to get back into this			0
@entity14 again ! @entity3 lead ! the @entity91 come from behind to take the lead in @entity10			1
the warning signs were there for @entity6 from a couple of previous crosses into the box			1
this time , though , another free header for an @entity3 player and @entity14 makes no mistake , guiding the ball into the far corner			1
it will take a big effort from @entity6 now to get back into this			1
another one for @entity6 , and again the right decision			1
costly was offside from the ball played through by @entity109			0
no vociferous protests this time , though , from @entity6 ' players			1
it was a decent shout for @entity3 , but none of their players really appealed for it			1
@entity117 found himself in behind the defence and @entity119 came in at full stretch			0
the @entity6 defender did n't make contact with the ball , and he definitely caught @entity117			1
in other news , @entity125 went into the book			1
that 's about all there is to report from a rather poor first 15 minutes in the second half			2
it 's been nothing like the first			0
both managers must have had a word with their teams because the start of the second half has been far more controlled with both teams looking to keep possession			2
@entity3 still coming forward and moving the ball fast , but so far @entity6 holding firm			1
51 mins played - 1 - 1			0
right , time for the second half in @entity10			1
one change for @entity6 as @entity145 's @entity144 replaces @entity147 's @entity146			1
well that was a pleasant surprise – end to end , toe to toe , stud to stud , call it what you may , it was entertaining stuff			0
honduras have fared better than anticipated and , to give air to one well - worn phrase , this one really could go either way			0
a breath - taking first half full of incident in @entity10			1
there has been good football , mistakes , tough challenges , cards and goals ... everything we need for an enjoyable game			2
having said that , a draw is n't much good to both teams as it will leave them in 3rd and 4th place respectively in this group			2
still , more of the same in the second half please			2
@entity6 though they were back ahead then			2
@entity7 's header came cannoning back off the post to @entity180 , who tapped home from two yards and ran off to celebrate			2
the referee 's whistle went , though , and the goal was ruled out			0
it was the right decision , @entity180 handled the ball , and he was offside for good measure			0
this has been one of the more enjoyable contests i 've seen at this @entity12			0
you can see the fight in both teams desperate for a win and the energy and physicality has made this a gripping game , as well as the mistakes			0
both goals were quite sloppy from the defending teams , but that 's fitting of this game			0
three minutes until half - time			0
that did n't last long			0
a goal from absolutely nothing			0
@entity207 was running with the ball and there seemed to be nothing on			0
@entity207 shot from the edge of the area and it took a deflection before finding @entity0 , who had gambled at the far post and earned himself a tap in			2
@entity6 made a lot of mistakes in the first half hour , but @entity218 makes the most costly one of all and the @entity8 lead			1
@entity218 lost the ball just outside his own penalty area , and @entity7 picked it up before smashing home low and hard past @entity224			2
@entity6 ' first @entity12 goal since 1982 and they 're loving it			1
@entity3 slightly on top , but it 's very hard to tell as this game is so stretched and frenetic			2
@entity6 making a lot of mistakes , but both teams playing with plenty of energy and physicality			2
i would n't bet on another goalless draw in @entity10 on this evidence			2
and @entity0 has blown it			2
just a long ball over the top and the @entity3 striker was played on side by @entity146 , but @entity125 volleyed wide of the far post			1
@entity243 let off for @entity6 and a big warning			2
shock ! within three seconds of kick - off there are three players laid out on the turf after a meaty @entity8 challenge			0
at least if it ’s a spikey affair it will be an improvement on the tedium of 24 hours ago when @entity253 and @entity254 played out a predictable stalemate			0
a real stretched game this one and a lively first 15 minutes			0
not may chances to report so far , but that 's not down to a lack of trying			0
i sense both teams are desperate for a win to push themselves back into contention in this group			0
those of you who bet on the timing of the first card , it came after six minutes			0
@entity6 ' @entity271 the man who goes into the book for a cynical foul just outside the area on @entity0			1
real end - to - end stuff to begin this match as first of all @entity117 's direct running and good cross causes problems for @entity6 goalkeeper @entity281			2
at the other end , @entity7 led the counter attack and his low cross had @entity3 goalkeeper @entity224 scrambling			1
good atmosphere in @entity10 for this one			2
both sets of supporters sense that this is their best chance of a victory			0
@entity3 kick us off in @entity10 ... and @entity6 foul within five seconds			1
this could be a good match to bet on card markets			0
two more passionate national anthems , in keeping with the @entity91 ( central in @entity6 ' case ) theme , completed and we 're ready for kick - off in @entity10			1
real incentive for the winner today to leap into second place ahead of @entity53			1
@entity6 and @entity3 met in a friendly in @entity304 last november and it finished 2 - 2 on that occasion			1
@entity7 scored twice in five minutes for the @entity8 on that occasion , and @entity3 needed an 89th - minute equaliser from @entity0 in @entity308			1
please do n't shut your laptop down after this , but here goes			0
before @entity58 's 5 - 2 win over @entity53 in @entity316 , the previous two games at the venue were @entity317 1 - 5 @entity319 and @entity43 4 - 0 @entity318			1
on the other hand , the only other game to be played in @entity10 finished @entity39 0 - 0 @entity47			2
the late game last night between @entity253 and @entity254 also finished 0 - 0			0
things can only get better			0
in the words of @entity325 - let me explain			0
both these teams played @entity328 in warm - up games in @entity330			0
both actually earned draws that looked very credible back then , that was until @entity328 were eliminated after two straight losses			0
@entity6 : @entity334 , @entity119 , @entity271 , @entity146 , @entity180 , @entity7 , @entity144 , @entity109 , @entity82 , @entity335 , @entity336 @entity3 : @entity224 , @entity337 , @entity338 , @entity207 , @entity339 , @entity340 , @entity218 , @entity117 , @entity14 , @entity341 , @entity125			1
let 's be honest , when the @entity12 fixtures were announced , this is probably the game that most of us decided we would n't stay up for			0
but after @entity58 smashed @entity53 in @entity316 just now , both these teams will feel they are back in the mix for second place in @entity5 kick - off an hour away in @entity10 , team news to follow shortly .			1
