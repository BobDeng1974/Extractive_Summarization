@entity0 has warned television broadcasters to stop messing around @entity3 football fans			1
the @entity5 boss leads his side into a @entity8 semi-final with @entity9 at @entity10 on sunday with a 12.15 kick - off			1
and after a week of turmoil and complaints – from clubs and supporters – over the unhealthy sway television has on kick - off times , @entity0 says the balance of power in the relationship is all wrong			1
@entity0 will take his @entity5 side to @entity10 for the @entity8 semi-final on sunday the match will take place at 12:15 , a time that @entity3 football fans do not agree with ' i think tv is an issue that i do n't like in terms of the kick - off times , ' said the @entity29			1
' it should not be tv that controls football – it should be the opposite			2
' it should be about the supporters and the clubs so that they can make money by getting people into the stands - because that is what we live for			1
' i understand the economics of it are so important and that television takes over and take control			2
' but i do n't like that			0
it 's not the best for people who like football			2
' the @entity51 sparked a furious row this week when they put back the final @entity54 game of the season by 24 hours for broadcast on @entity57 – sparking outright fury from @entity59 and @entity60			0
@entity5 players train at @entity62 in preparation for sunday 's crunch match against @entity9 @entity0 ( right ) believes that teams should have more of a say on kick - off times , rather than broadcasters both capital clubs have lodged formal complaints over the governance of the game , with chief executive @entity73 under pressure ahead of a stormy @entity75 on thursday			1
at the heart of the problem is the growing fury of fans at being messed around with late changes to kick - off dates and times to facilitate broadcasters offering @entity3 football a tiny fraction of the billions paid to @entity87 clubs			1
none of @entity5 's post-split fixtures will be played on a saturday at 3pm , forcing season - ticket holders from @entity91 and @entity87 to cancel or alter their travel plans			1
' there are different traditions in different countries , ' added @entity0			1
' in @entity29 , we had the best time , which is six o'clock on sunday , but now they are doing different times			1
' in the end , you do n't know when games are going on			0
' it 's so hard to plan the weekend with the family and also get to the games			0
' if saturday at 3pm is the best for @entity106 then we should play more at that time			2
a @entity5 scarf displayed outside @entity108 shows fans ' desire for @entity0 to win them the treble this season ' i would also rather play at six in the evening than 12 in the morning			1
' i think football should be played at night because then you get a better atmosphere into the arena			2
' addressing concerns that @entity5 are being affected more than most through large gaps in the stands , @entity0 acknowledged : ' it 's a big problem for us			1
we need supporters to come to the games			2
we need interest and television needs it , as well			2
' if there are no people in the stadiums then it will be more boring to watch			0
' i do n't like it that television is telling us when we are playing			0
we want to set the time ourselves			0
' communication is very important here			0
it 's the same when i am talking with @entity135			0
i want certain things and he wants his things			0
we both put our points across hard and then we compromise			0
' i think it should be the same between the clubs and television			0
there has to be give and take			0
' in this matter , we do n't have much of a say			0
we have to play most of our games at 12 o'clock and that 's not the best for our supporters			1
' supporting the view of @entity60 , @entity59 and @entity54 that the decision to play the final game of the @entity153 season 24 hours after the rest was foolish and contrary to ' sporting integrity ' , @entity0 added : ' in my opinion , in the last two rounds of matches every team should play at the same time so you ca n't play knowing other results			1

@entity5 will play their @entity8 semi-final against @entity9 on sunday
the match kicks off at 12:15 , which has angered @entity3 supporters
@entity5 boss @entity0 believes the club should decide kick - off times
fans believe it is *unfair* for television broadcasters to *dictate* timings when they are offering @entity3 football a fraction of the billions paid in @entity87
