' relax - here even the sharks are friendly			2
' i am given this advice by my guide as , a few steps into the azure waters , i come face to fin with a shark			2
i can only watch in shock as a 5ft - long lemon shark glides within inches of my knees , before veering out to sea			2
welcome to @entity13 , a tiny island off @entity14 so abundant in marine life that you can barely get into the water without standing on it			1
a true slice of heaven : the @entity13 islands are @entity14 at its most picturesque @entity13 is just one of the attractions in the @entity14 state of @entity26 , a small region on the @entity28 coast in the north - east of the country			1
one of the first areas to be settled by the @entity32 in the 16th century , the region is characterised by colonial buildings , multicultural cuisine and an ever - present carnival soundtrack			2
i quickly discover @entity36 , the elegant @entity38 - listed colonial town set high on a hill , five miles up the coast from @entity41 , the state capital			2
its 22 opulent churches and 11 chapels emerge from a verdant froth of palm and banana trees			0
i saunter up steep cobbled streets lined with pastel - painted art galleries and workshops , and spend the sultry evenings sipping drinks in arty bars lit by candles			0
the road between @entity36 and @entity41 is dotted with crumbling sugar mills			0
the 16th century sugar trade founded both cities , though by the end of the 17th @entity59 had become the biggest , most important city in @entity61			0
these days , information technology drives its economy - and its regeneration			0
over the past two years , hip bars , waterfront galleries and trendy restaurants have sprung up			0
with streets of gracious latte - tinted buildings set with @entity72 columns and @entity74 domes , the grand old @entity76 and @entity75 with the oldest synagogue in the @entity78 , the place oozes history and charm			0
but @entity26 is prized by all @entity14 for one thing			1
when i tell a @entity14 friend i 'm going to @entity13 , she shrieks with excitement : ' you are not going to @entity14 , ' she trills			1
' you are going to @entity88			0
' colourful chaos : @entity36 , in @entity26 , is listed as a @entity90 @entity14 has some heavenly beaches , many of them in and around @entity41			1
i stayed in @entity41 's @entity94 district - three miles of pure gold sand so magnificent that the sight of it whisked the fuzz from my jet - lagged brain like a cerebral bikini wax			1
forty - five miles down the coast , past @entity102 , where tropical fish dip and dazzle in natural reef pools close to the palm - shaded shore , the powdery white beaches of @entity105 are fringed by coconut plantations , and mangrove lagoons in which seahorses bob			1
but even these , say the guide books , are eclipsed by the beaches of @entity13 - which is incredible as this tiny island is only six miles long and two miles across			1
its pristine beaches and crystal - clear , marinerich waters are so popular that visitors to this @entity38 - listed @entity122 are limited to 500 a day ( and they are charged an eco-tax )			1
after an hour 's flight from @entity41 , i spend three days discovering @entity13 's 17 beaches			1
to the south , @entity126 has the wow - factor			0
a huge fan of golden sand blasted by wind straight off the @entity28 , this is one of the most important turtle hatching sites in @entity14			1
the @entity134 in the north is even more magical : i sit on pillow - soft sand watching huge seabirds soar on the thermals , then plunge into the rolling surf			0
a short clamber over volcanic rocks and i emerge into @entity142			0
framed by cliffs , the rockpool - dimpled beach is so impossibly pretty , overlooking waters so impossibly blue , it 's hard to believe it is real			1
even harder to believe is the view from the next headland , @entity150 : multiple pods of spinner dolphins leap from the sea , light flashing from their slick bodies like disco balls			0
but nothing comes close to wading into the calm waters of @entity159 , wearing flippers , snorkel and mask			2
and not just because i nearly tread on a shark			0
the shore quickly falls away , and within moments i am swimming over coral reef			0
friendly faces : visitors are assured a warm welcome , whether it is during @entity36 's famous spring carnival ( left ) , or from the lemon sharks @entity173 encountered in the warm waters around @entity13 ( right ) the water in this part of the @entity28 is @entity177 , with visibility up to 165ft			1
i have to force myself not to laugh with pleasure as , through a colourful curtain of tropical fish , i spot a huge octopus puffing along the ocean floor			0
then a giant turtle appears just feet away			0
life 's a beach on @entity13			1
