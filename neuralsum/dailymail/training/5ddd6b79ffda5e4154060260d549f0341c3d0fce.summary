lethal : the first @entity108 of this year got underway in @entity109 , @entity93 , yesterday leap of faith : a runner manages to get out of the way of the charging bulls in @entity99 by jumping up on to the fencing charge : it was the first time that @entity99 's famous encierro took place with bulls that would be used in bullfighting in the arena and , as is often the case in the running of the bulls , one runner was a bit too slow and gored in the leg after being cornered by a bull			1
