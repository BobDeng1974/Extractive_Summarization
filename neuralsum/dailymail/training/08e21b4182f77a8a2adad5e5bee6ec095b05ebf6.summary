desperate : @entity0 was pushed to the brink of suicide by unscrupulous loan sharks easy credit has turned @entity5 into a nation of debtors and we are currently £ 158billion in the red			1
nine million of us have serious financial problems due to personal borrowing , and desperate families are increasingly turning to controversial pay day loans and loan ' sharks ' just to make ends meet			1
@entity0 , a mother - of - four from @entity17 in @entity18 , is one woman whose life has been turned upside down by some ill - thought - out borrowing			1
in december 2000 money was tight for @entity0 and her care worker husband @entity22			1
they borrowed £ 500 from a family friend to help make @entity26 a bit more special for their four children			2
@entity0 , who features on tonight 's @entity30 show ' @entity31 ' , described how @entity32 , an old school friend known to them as ' @entity34 ' first talked them into taking out a small loan : ' he just said that he had someone that could lend us £ 500			1
we went for it , we were never told there would be any interest added at all			0
' we thought we were just paying the £ 500 back			2
we thought he was our friend			0
' soon after christmas @entity32 ' ' contact ' was demanding that double the amount of the original loan was paid back , and with no means of raising the funds the @entity52 family began incurring huge interest charges			2
as the months went by the debt spiralled out of control , and was to end up costing @entity0 her home , her health and almost her life			1
after years of paying off up to £ 1,000 in interest each month , and being no closer to clearing the debt , the threats started and @entity32 suggested that he might have to sell the debt on to people who might damage their home , or even worse , physically attack @entity0 and her family			1
she says : ' i was n't coping very well			0
i had trouble going to sleep			0
the stress was really getting to my health			0
in 2005 i ended up having a stroke			0
' snowball : the mother - of - four ended up paying back over £ 100,000 on a £ 500 loan and her story is featured on @entity30 show ' @entity31 ' @entity0 recovered from the stroke but there was no escaping the debt			1
their ' friend ' was now demanding £ 1200 per month			2
soon they were taking equity out of the house to pay the loan , as well as handing over any extra money that they earned			2
over the next few years @entity0 suffered four more strokes and a brain hemorrhage @entity0 says : ' i actually thought about taking tablets and ending it all			2
i was upstairs with them in my hand			0
' if it had n't been for my youngest shouting up to me just at that point i think i would have taken those tablets			0
' after an incredible eight years of living in fear , and making repayments of £ 128,000 , @entity0 finally broke her silence and told local police			1
it took her three days to describe the extent of the loan sharks extortion			1
when the police arrived at @entity32 ' house they found hi - tech tv and stereo equipment as well as piles of designer clothes and luxury furniture and fittings			0
he had been spending @entity0 's money living the high life whilst her and her family lived in fear			1
money worries : @entity117 and @entity118 are two other debtors who appear in the @entity30 show @entity32 went on trial in august 2009 and after pleading guilty to harassment was sentenced to 51 weeks in prison , suspended for two years , so he never actually faced time in prison			1
he was ordered to pay @entity127 £ 1,500 , which is less than the amount she had been paying him every month before he was held to account			0
she says : ' if i had n't revealed my story to police i would still be paying today			0
he should be in prison			0
i felt like i was in prison for ten years			0
