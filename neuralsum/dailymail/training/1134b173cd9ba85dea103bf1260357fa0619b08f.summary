when i told my daughter that for the first time in her life i would not be going to an office every day , she looked delighted			1
but what she said next astonished me			2
‘ does that mean you can pick me up from school in the afternoons ? ’ now , my daughter is not seven , the age when children come out of class anxiously scanning the waiting crowd for @entity15 or @entity16			1
no , @entity17 is 14			2
@entity18 is pictured here with her daughter @entity17 , 14			1
@entity18 has realised how important it is to @entity17 that she 's there to collect her from school each day the last thing i ’d expect a teenager to want is her mother standing at the school - gates — but my daughter does , seemingly as much as the reception - age kids who hurtle out of school straight into their parent ’s arms			1
i ’ve been turning up to collect her for six weeks , ever since giving up my office - based job in tv to concentrate on writing at home			2
and when i ask why my presence in the playground means so much to her , i receive another startling — and worrying — reply			2
‘ when i see you , mum , ’ she says , ‘ i know that i ’m safe			2
’ it ’s been a startling revelation to realise that my teenage daughter needs me just as much now as she did when she was tiny			1
@entity18 , pictured here with @entity17 as a baby , believes all parents should be taking some time out during their child 's teenage years when she was born , i took a year ’s leave and spent those precious early months bonding with her			1
i felt terrible going back to work and leaving her when she was a toddler — i still vividly remember trying to sneak out of the house so she would n’t notice , hoping to avoid a heart - wrenching crying fit			2
but seeing her now , i suddenly understand with a shudder of anxiety just how difficult life is for teens today , and that it ’s during these later years — not her earliest — that she really requires her mother ’s presence			1
and i do n’t think she is unusual			2
indeed , as well as maternity leave , i believe there should be a period of ‘ time off ’ enshrined in law for the parents of teenagers — we could call it ‘ teenternity leave ’			1
14 per cent of the 340,000 women who go on maternity leave each year find their jobs at threat when they try to return			1
i think all teenage girls and boys would benefit from closer parental guidance during this most delicate of phases			1
i ’ve noticed a number of changes in my daughter in the six weeks since i ’ve been at home			1
she seems happier and calmer			2
her homework gets done with less fuss			2
she eats more tomatoes and fewer crisps			2
she goes to bed at a reasonable hour			0
in other words , everything i ’ve been striving to encourage her to do over the past few years			0
of course , it ’s always been tough being a teenager			0
i remember well the shame of being the only girl in the class still wearing @entity99 sandals , for example			0
but i would n’t want to be a 14 - year - old girl in 2015 for all the money in the world			0
modern teens have it harder than ever			0
the pressure to fit in is so much greater			0
at least when i came home from school in the @entity109 , i could escape from the mean - girl chorus of disapproval			0
but today — thanks to social media — there is no escape from the judgment of others			1
today ’s teenagers do n’t come home from school and spend an hour on the sofa watching @entity120			1
they are too busy sending images of themselves via the online photo - sharing app @entity122 to 50 of their closest friends			0
@entity18 ( right ) thinks modern teens , like @entity17 ( left ) , have it ' harder than ever ' with the constant pressures of social media @entity17 ’s phone is never silent ; it cheeps , rings and bellows all day and all night long			1
at her age i was also in touch with my friends while at home — i used to spend hours on the phone dissecting the events of the day			0
but going through the minutiae of who said what to whom was a good deal less appealing with my brother and father listening in			0
for my daughter ’s generation , there are no such limits			1
as the person who pays her phone bill , i can see that there have been nights where she ’s been texting and ‘ chirpsing ’ ( a kind of digital flirting or chatting up ) way into the small hours , which horrifies me			0
today ’s teens are also not restricted , as we were , to spending time with friends only in the flesh ; you can have a virtual party with all your closest pals on @entity164 — a messaging service — whenever you like			1
worse , you can chat online with perfect strangers at any hour of the day or night			0
@entity18 ( right ) is pictured here with her mother , @entity168 ( left ) and her oldest daughter @entity169 in 1991			1
@entity18 thinks even @entity169 had it easier as a teenager just ten years ago the problem is that if you are feeling a little bit vulnerable , there is no escape from the feeling of being scrutinised			1
of course , plenty of teenagers are supportive of each other , but there are plenty more who fasten on evidence of vulnerability like piranha fish on a gaping wound			0
now that i ’m at home , i realise just how much time my daughter has been spending in this parallel digital universe , and how badly it can affect her self - esteem			1
i also realise how hard it has been for her to come back to an empty house for years with nothing to do before her parents get back from work but bare her soul on social media			1
i have an older daughter , too — ten years older			1
in the space of that decade , teenage life has to my mind become far more difficult			0
she could talk to friends , but there was no shared ‘ space ’ for them to meet virtually			0
there was no teen - only media ; nowhere to swap no - holds - barred opinions without adult supervision			0
but now i ’ve seen what has been going on in my own home , i feel that parents nowadays need to be as vigilant with their teenagers as they are with toddlers			1
it ’s mental harm you must protect against , not physical danger — but both ages require constant attention , and the careful calibration of house rules , as psychotherapist @entity226 points out : ‘ there are two periods in a child ’s life when it is most crucial for parents to set effective boundaries : when they first become physically active and again in adolescence , ’ she says			1
‘ it ’s vital for children to know where the limits are			1
and it ’s equally vital parents learn when to move those boundaries as children gain in competence			1
’ policing a digitally savvy teenager is not easy			0
but after some discussion , my daughter and i have a new common ground			2
we have agreed on a ‘ no screens after 9pm ’ rule , since there is some scientific evidence to show that looking at a computer or phone screen before you go to bed can interfere with the quality of your sleep			0
and after months of complaining that she ca n’t sleep , @entity17 is able to get a good night ’s rest in a bedroom that is not humming with digital chatter			0
@entity18 pictured ( left ) with her mother and sister @entity261			1
@entity18 says at @entity17 's age she was also in touch with her friends while at home spending hours on the phone each day after school still , the only way i can enforce this , and fully remove temptation , is to confiscate the phone every night at 9pm — and lock it away until the morning			1
i also have to unplug the router			0
of course , this means that my own social media addictions are also curtailed at 9pm , but we all sleep better as a result			0
i wo n’t pretend my daughter is always delighted by my new stance			2
there is always ‘ just one more ’ text she has to send			0
but i can stand a bit of door slamming if it means she gets the chance to switch off			0
of course , i would n’t have known any of this had i not made a change to my working patterns			0
and i find that worrying			0
what if i ’d gone on working all hours regardless ? would @entity17 have muddled through ? or would the apparent lack of safety she felt without me have caused real damage ? @entity17 ( right ) says she feels safe when she sees her mum @entity18 ( left ) standing at the school gates each day although teenagers appear to be self - absorbed and self - sufficient , they are just as needy as toddlers			1
they just are n’t as ready or able to show it			0
i would warn any parent of an early adolescent not to underestimate the importance of paying attention to your children , even if it appears that they would far rather talk to their screens			2
we ca n’t disconnect our children or ourselves from the siren call of the digital world , but it is up to us to make sure they have time when they can relax			2
i ’m horrified now at how close i came to missing this crucial window in my daughter ’s life and i say to you — take a look a your child ’s phone bills			2
if they are texting in the small hours , it may be time to spend more time at home			0
i can assure you , you ’ll all sleep better at night .			0

@entity18 realised her daughter needs her as much now as when she was little
she thinks there should be ' teenternity leave ' for all parents
her belief is that closer parental guidance would benefit today 's children
