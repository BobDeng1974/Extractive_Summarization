we 've all inadvertently put our foot in it while trying to be helpful to a fellow human at some point or another , but what 's it like being on the receiving end of this day - in , day - out ? pretty irritating according to a new ask @entity9 thread , which invited members of the disabled community to list all the ways able - bodied people think they are being supportive , but end up being just the opposite			1
' do n't call me an inspiration			2
be your own damn inspiration , ' one user wrote , amid nearly 4,000 comments made in the space of a day			2
do n't say it ! a new ask @entity9 thread invited members of the disabled community to list all the ways able - bodied people think they are being supportive , but end up being just the opposite ( picture posed by models ) ' i do n't want to be your inspiration , i want to be your next door neighbor and i want to be left to my own devices please , ' another wrote			1

' i 'm pretty sure i did n't say " hey , universe , make me handicapped			0
" ' there 's nothing brave or strong about it			1
my strength and courage comes from what i do			0
' many disabled people say it was insulting and patronising to be ' praised ' for doing normal things , like going to university ( picture posed by models ) another user echoed this , stating : ' if anything , i have n't been brave			1
just careless for being in a place that i really should n't have been at the time			0

' [ the ] situation would be similar to seeing someone who looked tired at the bottom of a hill , and offering to carry them up			0

a new @entity9 thread asked disabled people to submit their *pet* *peeves*
