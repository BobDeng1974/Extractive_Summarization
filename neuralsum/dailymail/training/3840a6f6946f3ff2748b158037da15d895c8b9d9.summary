@entity0 , 24 , had planned to meet the woman ’s 15 - year - old daughter , after sending her explicit messages online			1
he was on his way to see the girl , armed with a knuckle duster , a police baton , a book on sex toys and a bottle of vodka , when he was arrested by officers who had been alerted by the mother			2
but despite being warned that @entity0 was ‘ at high risk of reoffending ’ , a judge let him off with a supervision order			2
months after avoiding a jail term , @entity0 contacted another young girl online , posing as a teenager called @entity36			1
he was caught out , but the garage worker has been allowed to walk free by a judge yet again			0
the first victim ’s mother expressed her anger at the ‘ lenient ’ criminal justice system and called for @entity0 to be jailed to protect other children			1
she said he would prey on young girls ‘ again and again ’ if judges only gave him a ‘ slap on the wrist ’			0
using a fake name , @entity0 had tried to lure the woman ’s daughter into meeting him by sending her intimate pictures of himself on @entity3 and offering to buy her presents in return for sex			1
but his plan was foiled when the horrified mother , who can not be named for legal reasons , found the messages and arranged a meeting , pretending to be her daughter			2
the mother , from @entity62 , said : ' i knew he would do it again			2
' the sentence he got was too lenient in the first place			0
' he was supposed to be banned from using the internet but unless somebody is there with him 24/7 it is easy for it to happen again			0
' it makes me realise there there is something wrong with the system for him to go out and do it again			0
he is a very dangerous boy			0
' @entity80 @entity79 heard that despite being subject to the order and three - year community supervision , @entity0 , posing as ‘ @entity83 ’ , contacted the 14 - year - old girl via social media in august			1
he claimed to know her and asked her to send a photo of her bedroom , ‘ to ensure she was on her own ’			0
@entity90 , prosecuting , told the court how @entity0 exchanged messages with the girl for two weeks , before eventually revealing ‘ @entity36 ’ was really a boy and telling her to delete their conversations			2
miss @entity90 said the girl asked if he was ‘ that paedo arrested last year ’ and @entity0 agreed , saying it had been ‘ a mistake ’			1
but the girl told her mother and @entity0 was arrested by police			1
the mother of the 15 - year - old girl ( both are pictured in silhouette to protect their identities ) who was groomed online by @entity0 has said she ' knew he would do it again ' he refused to give officers the password to his phone or computer and to answer their questions			1
miss @entity90 added : ' this was deliberate contact , targeting a young girl , aware of her age and identity , directly flouting the terms of the previous order			2
' @entity0 admitted breaching the order and has remained in custody since his arrest on august 11			2
@entity124 , defending , told the court how @entity0 has a hearing impediment which requires him to lip read , and this may have partly caused his social immaturity			0
mr @entity124 said : ' clearly the behaviour in the original case was more serious than this			0
' but , it has brought about what everyone was trying to avoid , namely the incarceration of this young man for more than two months now			0
' contacting girls younger than him , under the age of 16 , was something of a pre-occupation , but that was because of his inability to form relationships with girls his own age			0
' @entity80 @entity79 heard that despite being the subject of a sexual prevention order , @entity0 posed as ' @entity83 ' to contact the girl on @entity3 recorder @entity152 said as @entity0 has spent more than two months in custody he could impose a three - year community supervision order during which he will undergo intensive sex offender treatment work			1

she said was horrified to overhear her young daughter telling friends she had been to meet a 21 - year - old man she had been speaking to on @entity3 - and then demanded to see the messages between them			1
she spoke of how she was sickened to read the sexually explicit exchanges between her impressionable daughter and @entity0 - who knew the girl was 15 all along			1
the mother intercepted the messages and arranged a meeting with the @entity163			0
he turned up with a car full of weapons and a book about sex and was arrested			0
