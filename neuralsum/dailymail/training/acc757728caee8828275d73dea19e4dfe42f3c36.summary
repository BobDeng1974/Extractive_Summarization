by @entity0 published : 13:14 est , 10 april 2012 updated : 12:52 est , 11 april 2012 @entity1 has abruptly suspended his @entity3 bid , effectively ending the battle for the @entity6 presidential nomination and allowing a victorious @entity7 to focus solely on defeating @entity8 in november			1
the former @entity9 for @entity10 won 11 states but had dropped to a very distant second place in the delegate count			0
he did not mention @entity7 once in a speech in @entity16 , @entity10 , site of the historic @entity18 battle , in which he announced his candidacy was over , fuelling @entity6 fears that there could be continued disunity in the party			1
dropping out : surrounded by his family , former @entity10 senator @entity1 announced on tuesday that he is suspending his campaign for the @entity6 presidential candidacy ' we made a decision over the weekend that , while this presidential race for us is over , for me , and we will suspend our campaign effective today , we are not done fighting , ' he said at a news conference hastily arranged instead of a planned rally			1
@entity34 and @entity35 officially remain in the race but have no hope of denying @entity7 , who now becomes the presumptive @entity6 nominee before being formally anointed at the @entity6 convention in @entity40 in august , which party bosses had feared might degenerate into an ugly fight			1
@entity1 , 53 , had looked like he would be an also - ran for most of the @entity6 campaign but surged to a very narrow – though belatedly announced – victory in first - voting @entity45 in january			1
after a stunning triple win in @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 in february he briefly looked like he could topple @entity7 , 65 , the long - time establishment favourite			1
he displaced @entity51 as the main conservative threat to @entity7 but his failure to win in the battleground states of @entity55 and @entity56 meant his challenge quickly faded			2
when @entity1 suffered three defeats last tuesday in @entity60 , @entity61 and the @entity62 , his presidential hopes for 2012 were all but over			1
emotional : @entity1 embraced his wife @entity63 , who had struggled to contain her tears , after the speech stubborn : @entity1 did not endorse frontrunner @entity7 - or even mention him - in his departure speech his daughter @entity68 , three , who suffers from a rare and usually fatal genetic disorder , was hospitalised on friday , prompting @entity1 to leave the campaign trail			1
in his speech , @entity1 said that @entity72 was ' a passion play ' for his family because of @entity68 ’s illness of @entity68 and @entity75 weekend then became ' a time for prayer and thought ' about his campaign			2
@entity68 , who was also hospitalised in february , returned home yesterday			2
@entity1 opened the press conference on tuesday with news of his daughter , and how consideration for her had been part of his decision to step down			1
he said of @entity68 : ' she is a fighter , she is doing exceptionally well and we are looking forward to spending a lot of great time with her			0
' but it did cause us to think as the role we have is parents in her life			0
this was a time for prayer and thought this weekend			0
we were very concerned about being the best parents we possibly could to our children			0
' referring to his initial prospects and the fact that most commentators had dismissed his chances , @entity1 described his presidential bid as being ' as improbable as any race you ’ll ever see for president '			1
tough competition : it is believed that the move leaves the way open for frontrunner @entity7 to stand almost unopposed to take on president @entity8 later this year family : @entity1 is pictured with his three - year - old daughter @entity68 , who was hospitalised last week for months , @entity1 had pounded @entity7 for being insufficiently conservative and a weak candidate to face @entity8			1
in his speech , he talked of fighting to ensure @entity6 held the @entity111 and won back the @entity9 but did not mention the @entity3			2
' this game is a long , long , long way from over , ' he said			0
just after the announcement , @entity7 issued a somewhat tepid statement : ' @entity1 is an able and worthy competitor , and i congratulate him on the campaign he ran			1
' he has proven himself to be an important voice in our party and in the nation			0
we both recognise that what is most important is putting the failures of the last three years behind us and setting @entity124 back on the path to prosperity			0
' catalyst : during the speech , @entity1 said he was committed to being the best parent to @entity68 he could be fighter : @entity1 's daughter is now out of hospital , where she was being treated for pneumonia @entity1 telephoned @entity7 before his speech to inform him of his decision			1
the former senator ’s spokesman @entity137 later told @entity139 that the @entity7 campaign had asked for a meeting about an endorsement and that @entity1 would be ' open ' to this			1
rival @entity35 congratulated @entity1 on his ' spirited campaign ' , while @entity34 called his fight ' remarkable '			1
@entity51 vowed to remain in the until the convention to give conservatives ' a real choice '			0
although best known as a strong social conservative with outspoken views against abortion and gay marriage , @entity1 also campaigned as a foreign policy hawk and emphasised his blue - collar roots			1
he hinted at sore feelings towards @entity7 , who had defeated him partly with the aid of a huge war chest that enabled him to buy some devastating negative ads. competition : for months , @entity1 had pounded @entity7 for being insufficiently conservative and a weak candidate to face president @entity8 ' we were n't out there trashing anybody … we painted a hopeful , positive vision for our country , ' he said			1
@entity1 also pointed out that he won ' more counties ' that the other @entity6 candidates combined , an indication of his strength among rural voters			1
but despite his wins in 11 states , @entity1 ’s vote tally was 3.2 million votes compared to @entity7 ’s 4.6 million			1
in the one measure that really counted , @entity1 netted 285 convention delegate compared to @entity7 ’s 661 thus far			1
a candidate must get 1,144 delegates to clinch the nomination			2
@entity1 ’s exit came as the @entity7 campaign was preparing to air a barrage of negative ads against him in @entity10			1
it took senior republicans by surprise , though a number had counselled that he had to avoid losing in @entity10 at all costs			0
having begun his candidacy as a second or even third tier prospect , @entity1 is young enough to look forward to being a front - rank contender in 2016 , should @entity7 lose to @entity8 , or 2020			1
rivals : @entity35 ( @entity194 ) congratulated @entity1 on his ' spirited campaign '			2
@entity51 ( r ) called it a ' remarkable ' fight support : @entity1 had enjoyed wins in @entity45 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 during the campaign ' we are not done fighting , ' he said			1
' we are going to continue to fight for those voices …			2
there ’s a lot of greatness , a lot of greatness in this country			0
' his campaign , he emphasised , had begun with a discussion around the family ’s kitchen table and had ended the same way			0
' it was a love affair for me , going from state to state and seeing the differences , but seeing the wonderful , wonderful people of this country , ' he said			0
by ‘ suspending ’ his campaign rather than formally ending it , @entity1 can continue to collect contributions to pay off his campaign debts			1
stepping down ahead of the @entity10 primary in two weeks , which could have proved a humiliating defeat on his home turf , @entity1 has left the campaign at a high point			2
having collected 11 states and thousands of voters , the former @entity10 senator is now well - placed to manipulate his popularity to further his career – whether it be in politics or elsewhere			2
a comparison can perhaps be drawn with @entity236 , the former governor of @entity237 and a candidate in the 2008 @entity6 presidential race , eventually won by @entity240			2
like @entity1 , @entity236 enjoyed early success in @entity45 , followed by wins in @entity243 , @entity244 and @entity245			2
but he bowed out in early march as it became increasingly clear it would be tough to forge a win in @entity249			0
following his campaign , @entity236 has courted controversy yet has also enjoyed success , publishing a @entity253 bestseller and writing another , non-political book			0
in june 2008 , he was hired by @entity256 as a political commentator and contributor for their election coverage			0
he now hosts a weekend show called @entity236 on @entity256			0
other one - time candidates , such as @entity263 , have also enjoyed relative success as talk show hosts and commentators after their failed bids			0
for many other candidates - both those who have enjoyed success and those who have not - returning for later presidential elections is a theme			0
two candidates who took part in the 2008 bid for @entity6 presidential candidate - @entity35 and today 's front - runner @entity7 - returned this year			1
@entity278 sentor @entity240 came back from second place in 2000 to take the candidacy in 2008			0
other names such as @entity282 , @entity283 and @entity284 crop up over more than one year , signalling @entity1 could be back in 2016 - providing @entity7 is not at the helm			1
remaining in politics is an option , as is lobbying			0
looking further back to 2004 - and therefore jumping sides to a @entity290 battle - candidates who bowed out turned towards lobbying			0
@entity293 , a man mentioned as possible vice president in five separate campaign years , was considered a strong candidate when he entered the race , eventually won by @entity298			2
dropping out after finishing in fourth place , he went on to set up a consultancy and lobbying group , and has lobbied on behalf of pharmaceutical companies and @entity304 - to mixed reactions			0
whatever @entity1 decides to do , he has business to attend to first			2
following his announcement on tuesday he immediately appealed to supporters to help pay off his campaign debt			0
' i am planning to do everything in my power to bring a change about in the @entity3 , ' he wrote in a campaign email			0
' but our campaign has debt , and i can not be free to focus on helping defeat him with this burden			0

decision follows @entity1 's three devastating defeats last week
comes just days after seriously - ill daughter was hospitalised
did not endorse another candidate but promised to continue to fight
