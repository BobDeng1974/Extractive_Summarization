@entity5 , 72 , from @entity6 in the @entity7 , was rushed to @entity8 after eye expert @entity9 spotted warning signs during a routine appointment			2
doctors were amazed when later tests gave a systolic blood pressure reading of 254 – people should aim for a blood pressure of below 120/80			1
@entity5 , 72 , went to @entity2 to have his sight tested and was diagnosed with such high blood pressure he could have died systolic blood pressure is the maximum pressure the blood reaches as it is pushed around the body when the heart beats			1
a measurement of more than 140 represents high blood pressure			1
the result was so high that staff at the @entity26 , based at the hospital , thought their machine was faulty , only for a second reading to return identical statistics			2
mr @entity5 said : ‘ at first they thought the machine had broken , so they tried again			2
‘ when they got the same reading , they told me i should have been dead			0
‘ my pressure was that high they were surprised i was still standing			0
it was such a shock - i 'd never had any health problems before			0
mr @entity5 was seen by @entity9 ( left ) who was concerned by his recurring headaches and referred him to @entity8 for tests ‘ i have no doubt that @entity9 saved my life			1
’ mr @entity5 was put on tablets to help lower his blood pressure and has been fine ever since			1
his problems started in october when he started to suffer from recurring headaches and thought his glasses needed to be changed			1
he saw mr @entity9 at @entity2 ' @entity52 branch , in @entity26			0
the optician explained : ‘ mr day 's pressure tests were normal and his prescription had n't changed , but i was n't happy with how he was			2
doctors were amazed to find mr day had a systolic blood pressure reading of 254 - people should aim for a reading below 120			1
this is the pressure the blood is under when it is pumped away from the heart ‘ his body language was wrong and the constant headaches were a concern			2
i also spotted two small splinter haemorrhages near his optic nerve at the back of his eye			0
’ mr @entity9 called the eye centre and staff agreed to see mr day immediately			0
mr @entity5 said : ‘ without that visit and their prompt action i would have almost certainly suffered a stroke and could well have died			0
‘ it 's hard to believe an eye examination can pick these things up			0
i 'm now on tablets and i 've been fine ever since			0
mr @entity5 was put on tablets to help lower his blood pressure and is now in much better health			1
without treatment it is highly likely that he would have had a heart attack or a stroke ‘ i 'm a really chilled out person and do n't get stressed about anything , so hopefully that helped me			0
’ high blood pressure , or hypertension , is dangerous because it puts extra strain on the heart and blood vessels			1
this causes them to become weak and damaged			0
the higher your blood pressure , the greater your risk of health problems is			2
