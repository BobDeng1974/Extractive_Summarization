felines may enjoy the sound of a tin of cat food being prised open , but now they can listen to moggy music too			1
scientists have created the world ’s first keyboard for cats which plays notes at ultrasonic frequencies that cats can hear			1
a team of vets , scientists and sounds artists engineered the electric baby grand piano , which has been used to play the first ever concert for cats , in south east @entity18			1
in this image , musical moggies attend a concert for kitties felines were treated to ultrasonic renditions of @entity33 ’s ‘ @entity32 ’ and the @entity34 ’ ‘ @entity35 ’ as well as the soundtrack to @entity37			1
ultrasound is an oscillating sound pressure wave with a frequency greater than the upper limit of the human hearing range , which is typically around 20,000 hertz ( @entity43 ) for healthy humans			2
the music was played at frequencies of up to @entity50 , the higher ranges of which only cats can aurally appreciate			2
@entity51 ? some cats enjoyed the music so much that they leapt onto the keyboard and wandered over the keys to make their own melodies ( pictured ) feline groovy : cats were treated to ultrasonic renditions of @entity33 ’s ‘ @entity32 ’ and the @entity34 ’ ‘ @entity35 ’ as well as the soundtrack to @entity37 at the concert ( pictured )			1
it was put on as part of a viral protest against countries that it says censor the internet cats can hear ultrasonic frequencies - those that are beyond the upper limit of the human hearing range			1
the average healthy human can hear noises up to @entity71 , whereas cats can hear up to @entity50			2
they can hear 11 octaves - two more than a human and one more than a dog			1
when listening for something , a cat 's ears will swivel in that direction to target within three inches ( 7.5cm ) a sound being made from one yard ( 91cm ) away			0
they use this skill to accurately hunt prey			0
some cats enjoyed the music so much that they leapt onto the keyboard and wandered over the keys to play their own tunes			1
the keyboard has also been designed to play sounds that human ears pick up upon while the ultrasonic sounds are playing , so that pet owners - and the pianist - do n’t get bored			1
‘ a cat ’s hearing really is something to behold , ’ said vet @entity96 said			0
‘ behind those big , pointed , funnel - like ears is an incredibly complex auditory apparatus that can detect a larger range of sounds			2
‘ an impressive 11 octaves , to be precise , which is two octaves more than a human , and one octave more than a dog			1
‘ while research has suggested cats do enjoy music , this keyboard for cats will give felines the opportunity to enjoy their favourite compositions			1
’ the keyboard for cats was made as part of the viral protest , ‘ @entity120 , ’ which campaigns against countries such as @entity122 and @entity123 that it says censor the internet			1
listening to the mew - sic : the songs was played at frequencies of up to 64,000hz ( pictured left ) , the higher ranges of which only cats can aurally appreciate ( right ) an album for cats is available to the public and includes the ultrasonic feline - friendly versions of national anthems belonging to internet - censoring countries			1

@entity158 - @entity157 ( ‘ @entity159 ’ ) the campaign aims to break this censorship and uses cats to front the protest because of their popularity on the internet			2
the keyboard was commissioned by @entity167 which gives access to people being banned from the web			0
the concert was called ‘ protest concerto ’ and the pianist performed the national anthems from each of the internet censoring countries			1
pop songs were also chosen that have been banned by these countries online			0
‘ cats have a vastly superior sense of hearing to humans , ’ said @entity180 , marketing director at @entity167			2
‘ they ’re also known for being intelligent animals with quite discerning personalities			0
‘ if they were human they ’d probably be connoisseurs of classical music and delight in pursuits like poetry , gastronomy and international affairs			2
‘ we felt it was high time the cat ’s superior sensibilities were catered to properly			0
‘ this keyboard for cats is as much an homage to the original internet cat as it is a political statement against internet censorship			2
‘ it ’s one we hope people will want to talk about , share with their friends and use to spread the word that online censorship needs to end now			0
' a cd of ultrasonic music for cats will be available , featuring the national anthems belonging to internet - censoring countries , such as @entity142 , @entity145 , @entity122 , @entity149 and @entity156 , for example			1
