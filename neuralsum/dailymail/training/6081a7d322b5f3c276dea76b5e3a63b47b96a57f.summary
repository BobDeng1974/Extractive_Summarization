by @entity0 published : 11:35 est , 2 september 2013 updated : 12:13 est , 29 october 2013 an £ 11,000 - a - week former @entity3 footballer intervened in a row between his girlfriend and alleged lover and broke a @entity9 reveller ’s cheekbone , a court heard today			1
@entity11 striker @entity10 , 31 , was seeing in @entity12 2011 with girlfriend @entity13 when @entity14 allegedly confronted him at @entity16 ’s restaurant in @entity17 , @entity18			1
miss @entity14 , 48 , claimed she and @entity10 , who now plays for the @entity20 team , had recently met for sex - even describing the brand of boxer shorts he wore and the inside of his home			1
in court : @entity11 footballer @entity10 ( left ) is accused of breaking the jaw of @entity28 ( right ) @entity28 , 42 , who had been dining with his partner @entity30 and some friends at a nearby table , tried to calm down the footballer - but @entity10 lashed out , @entity17 @entity29 was told			1
he allegedly punched mr @entity28 so hard it fractured his cheekbone and damaged his eye socket			1
mr @entity28 ’s injuries were so serious he had to have surgery and now has titanium plates in his face			2
@entity10 - who played for @entity41 in south - east @entity42 at the time and has also been at @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 - is on trial charged with grievous bodily harm			1
opening the case , prosecutor @entity50 said : ‘ this case concerns an unfortunate incident at the end of a long and generally pleasant night in @entity17			0
‘ mr @entity10 , who is a professional footballer , was out with his girlfriend @entity13			1
they ate together at @entity16 ’s restaurant , then went through to the bar to see the @entity12 in			0
‘ mr @entity28 was out with his partner @entity30 and two female friends			2
the two groups had little contact with each other ... everything was perfectly convivial between them			0
‘ in fact none of the parties were responsible for sowing the seeds of tension that night			0
another person , @entity14 , was in the restaurant			2
‘ for reasons best known to herself , she behaved somewhat unpleasantly to mr @entity10 and @entity75 , asserting on more than one occasion , that she had recently had sex with mr @entity10			1
‘ she asserted that she could describe mr @entity10 ’s home to establish the truth of her assertions - it seems she may have correctly identified that brand of boxer shorts			2
‘ understandably this upset @entity75 and caused some tension between her and mr @entity10			2
equally understandably mr @entity10 was keen that miss @entity85 should leave him and miss @entity13 alone			1
location : @entity10 , 31 , was seeing in @entity12 2011 with girlfriend @entity13 when @entity14 allegedly confronted him at @entity16 's restaurant in @entity17 , @entity18 ‘ there is no reason to believe that this was anything other than pure fiction , but miss @entity85 persisted			1
’ jurors heard mr @entity28 tried to step in to calm things down			2
but then @entity10 , of @entity94 , @entity95 , allegedly punched him twice in the head			2
mr @entity50 said : ‘ it is possible that his intervention caused mr @entity10 , who was already upset and angered by miss @entity14 ’s behaviour , to perceive mr @entity28 as somehow associated with her			1
‘ what is absolutely clear , say the prosecution , is that mr @entity28 posed no threat to mr @entity10 whatsoever			1
even if his intervention was unwelcome it could not even begin to justify what he did			0
' ( @entity10 ) @entity10 punched @entity10 ( @entity28 ) @entity28 in the head twice			1
it may be the first blow did not connect but the second certainly did and mr @entity28 was knocked to the floor ' @entity50 , prosecuting ‘ he punched mr @entity28 in the head twice			2
it may be the first blow did not connect but the second certainly did and mr @entity28 was knocked to the floor			2
’ the attack was captured on the restaurant ’s @entity114 and 6ft 4in @entity10 was arrested at the scene			2
in the footage mr @entity28 was seen chatting to @entity10 at the bar after @entity75 walked off			1
some jurors gasped as they watched the video of @entity10 punching mr @entity28 twice after appearing to stumble off his seat			1
in an interview @entity10 told police he thought mr @entity28 was going to hit him			1
mr @entity50 told a jury of eight men and four women : ‘ mr @entity10 ’s case was , as it remains , that he perceived mr @entity28 to pose a threat to him so he hit first in self - defence			1
‘ the law does allow for pre-emptive strikes to be launched in self - defence but the prosecution say that is simply not the truth of what happened here			0
‘ if there can be an explanation of mr @entity10 ’s behaviour , the @entity29 submits it lies in his anger and frustration at what happened earlier in the evening , which was not of mr @entity28 ’s making			1
hearing : @entity17 @entity29 ( pictured ) was told @entity28 , 42 , who had been dining with his partner @entity30 and some friends at a nearby table , tried to calm the footballer down - but @entity10 lashed out ‘ even if that goes someway to explaining why mr @entity10 acted as he did , it can not and does not excuse it			1
’ giving evidence , mr @entity28 said he could not remember anything after 11pm			2
he told jurors : ‘ the next thing i remember is being in @entity156 having a brain scan			0
’ prior to that , he said : ‘ i remember talking to @entity13 outside at about 9pm			2
i asked her for a cigarette			0
‘ she said she had hair extensions and asked if they looked alright			0
she said she was with her partner , who she said was an athlete , and showed me a nice bracelet she was given for @entity166			0
’ ' do you recollect a conversation with mr @entity10 in which you suggested @entity41 were s * * * ? ' @entity169 , defending ' no , i do n’t follow football ' @entity28 @entity10 ’s lawyer @entity169 accused mr @entity28 of antagonising his client prior to the alleged assault at around 1.30am			1
he asked : ‘ do you recollect a conversation with mr @entity10 in which you suggested @entity41 were s * * * ? ’ ‘ no , i do n’t follow football , ’ mr @entity28 answered			1
he continued : ‘ any recollection of asking mr @entity10 to apologise to a woman and threatening him ? ’ ‘ no , ’ mr @entity28 said			1
mr @entity169 asked : ‘ do you know what bottling means ? any recollection of making that threat ? ’ ‘ no , ’ mr @entity28 replied			2
restaurant manager @entity183 said miss @entity14 , 48 , was being very loud in the bar area before tearing into @entity10			1
she said : ‘ the way she was speaking i think she wanted to be heard			0
i do n't know what she was saying exactly			0
striker : @entity10 ( right ) celebrates after scoring for @entity45 in a match against @entity190 in the @entity20 at @entity191 in 2007 ‘ at some point i saw her approach mr @entity10 and @entity13			1
she was very possessive and dominating			0
from what i could see she was going towards him and saying something and then going back			0
‘ she was drunk and being very unpleasant			0
i decided to keep an eye on her as she seemed to want to be the centre of attention and cause problems for people			0
’ ' at some point i saw ( @entity14 ) approach mr @entity10 and @entity13 ( @entity13 )			1
she was very possessive and dominating ' @entity183 , restaurant manager miss @entity183 said the couple began to look irritated and kept asking miss @entity85 to leave them alone			2
when she would n't @entity75 burst into tears and stormed out , the court heard			0
it was when @entity10 was sitting alone that mr @entity28 came over and there was a brief conversation between them			1
the restaurant manager said both men had been drinking but mr @entity28 seemed ' happy and cheerful			0
' she said : ‘ mr @entity28 went to the toilet then made his way to the bar			0
he stopped by mr @entity10			0
there was an exchange of words but very quiet not aggressive			0
‘ and then mr @entity10 punched him on his left cheek			0
that did n't really do anything apart from shock mr @entity28			0
he then gave him another punch and i saw blood and mr @entity28 went down on the floor			0
’ the court heard @entity10 and @entity75 are now no longer together			0
the case , which is expected to last three days , continues			0
