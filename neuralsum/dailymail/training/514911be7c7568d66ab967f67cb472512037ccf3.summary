by @entity0 published : 07:37 est , 19 march 2012 updated : 12:21 est , 19 march 2012 a drug - crazed thug who battered a nursery nurse so badly her own mother failed to recognise her because of her blood - soaked hair has been jailed for 12 years			1
@entity6 was forced to play dead after @entity7 punched the back of her head repeatedly after he pounced as she walked home in @entity11 , @entity12			1
her injuries were so bad her mother did not recognise her when she met her daughter 's ambulance as it reached hospital , especially because the blood had stained her blonde locks a shocking red			1
the 25 - year - old punched her repeatedly for 10 minutes and only stopped beating miss @entity6 , 24 , after a member of the public walked past in the early hours of july 30 last year			1
now and then : @entity6 , left , was so badly beaten that her usual blonde hair was left bright red because she lost so much blood from her head in the attack , right there was so much blood at the scene that when paramedics arrived they initially believed she had been stabbed			1
the judge said in court that if it had not been miss @entity6 who was attacked he would have assaulted another woman that night			1
' i was n’t aware anyone was following me , ' she said			0
' i heard a couple of footsteps and someone put their hand over my mouth from behind			0
when i turned around i realised i did n’t know him and he kept his hand over my mouth and was pinching my nose			0
' it was a struggle at first , i was throwing my arms everywhere and screaming but he had his hand over my mouth			0
' i was face down and he was using my hair to bash my head on the floor really hard			2
i thought that was it , i thought i was going to die			1
thug : @entity7 has been jailed for 12 years after ferociously attacking @entity6 in july last year ' so i thought maybe if i do play dead and stop breathing , he might go away			1
he was listening for my breathing and eventually i let out a gasp , then he kept on banging my head off the floor			2
' i ’m just relieved it ’s over			0
it was never going to be enough no matter what he got			0
' i ’ll just go home and try to get back to normal now			2
' she was rushed to @entity71 in @entity72 , where she had nine stitches to wounds in the back of her head			0
' my hair was exactly the same colour as it is now ( blonde )			1
there was a lot of blood , ' she said			2
' when they opened the ambulance doors my own mum did n’t even recognise me			0
my hair was completely red			1

' @entity7 was jailed for 12 years at @entity91 after he admitted unlawfully and maliciously wounding with intent to cause her grievous bodily harm			1
the court heard he had snorted at least three grams of cocaine and downed booze before launching the unprovoked attack			2
@entity7 was told he would serve at least nine years before being released			1
jailing him judge @entity99 said : ' she was a lady and she was a vulnerable victim			0
it must have been a terrifying incident			0
' this was a horrific offence			0
you went out on the night in question and chose to take with you two grams of cocaine			2
' during the course of that evening you had taken probably over three grams of cocaine			2
you were effectively out of control such that you had no control over your behaviour			0
' she was a lady and she was a vulnerable victim			0
it must have been a terrifying incident , ' judge @entity99 , pictured , said in court ' i can only presume this was a targeted attack			0
not that you targeted miss @entity6 , but that you targeted a girl			1
' the court heard @entity7 targeted her as she walked home in the early hours after a night out with friends in @entity11 , @entity12			1
@entity120 , prosecuting , told the court @entity7 left @entity6 in a pool of blood before ditching his blood - stained pink jumper and trainers in a car park			1
he then made his way across @entity11 and broke into a detached garage at someone ’s home where he stole a pair of golf shoes and a high visibility jacket			2
he was arrested by police at his home the next day after fingerprints found at the garage matched his own			2
mr @entity120 said : ' mr @entity7 had by all accounts consumed a large amount of drugs and alcohol that evening			1
' it was a random , isolated attack			0
she ( miss @entity6 ) thought she was going to die			1
' the bleeding caused her hair to effectively change colour to an almost red because of the amount of blood that had seeped through			1
' the court heard @entity7 claimed he launched a frenzied attack on @entity6 after snorting a bad batch of cocaine			1
@entity154 , defending , said : ‘ @entity7 took with him to the social club two grams of cocaine and he consumed it			1
‘ coupled with the consumption of cocaine was the consumption of a very large amount of alcohol			2
‘ one of the theories for his conduct and behaviour is the cocaine , which he got from a stranger			0
‘ one can hazard a guess that it caused this defendant to behave in a way that he had never behaved when taking cocaine previously			0
‘ what he did has no obvious explanation whatsoever			0
the bizarre behaviour occurred afterwards as well			0
the next recollection of @entity7 is waking up in a farmers field some way away			1
’ mr @entity154 went on to describe @entity7 behaviour as ‘ utterly out of character and totally inexplicable ’ - saying he had a strong network of family and friends who trusted him with their children			1
he added : ‘ he ’s a young man who is prepared to change and change for the better			0
' he has made it plain his absolute disgust at his own conduct that evening			0
' everyone who knows this defendant simply ca n’t believe he as committed an offence of this nature			0
