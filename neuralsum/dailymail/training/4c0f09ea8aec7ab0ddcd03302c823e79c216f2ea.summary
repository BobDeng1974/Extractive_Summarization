' but archaeologists can not do the work on these sites and excavate them because they are so dangerous - they are on the edge of a sea cliff			2
' i take my students to @entity185 every year and we are being told by the archaeologists up there that they are losing sites so fast they can not excavate and document them quick enough			0
' on the east coast around @entity192 the erosion has been going since time immemorial and now we are getting erosion on the west coast			0
