@entity1 striker @entity0 decided against copying @entity2 and celebrated with glee after scoring against former club @entity4			1
unlike @entity2 , who stayed stony - faced after scoring for @entity5 against @entity6 on sunday , @entity0 rushed over to the @entity1 fans arms aloft after sealing a win that took @entity9 's @entity1 up to seventh , only a point outside a play - off position			1
the 27 - year - old was roundly booed by the home fans who remembered he scored only once for them in 18 months after being brought down from @entity15 by @entity16			0
@entity1 striker @entity0 decided against copying @entity2 and celebrated scoring against @entity4 @entity0 rushed over to the @entity1 fans after sealing a win that took @entity9 up to seventh @entity1 moved into seventh position , only a point outside a play - off position , but it 's not so good for @entity4 @entity4 : @entity20 5.5 ; @entity21 6.5 , @entity22 6 , @entity23 6 ; perch 5.5 ; @entity24 5.5 , @entity25 6 , @entity26 5.5 ; @entity27 5.5 ( @entity28 36 ) , @entity29 4.5 ( @entity30 72 6 ) , @entity31 5.5 ( @entity32 64 6 ) unused subs : @entity34 ( @entity35 ) , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 goals : @entity30 ( 82 ) manager : @entity41 6 @entity1 : @entity42 6 ; @entity43 5.5 , @entity44 6 , @entity45 6 , @entity46 6 ; @entity47 6.5 , @entity48 6 ( @entity49 60 5.5 ) , @entity50 5.5 ( @entity51 70 ) ; @entity52 6.5 , @entity0 6 , @entity53 7.5 ( @entity54 90 ) unused subs : @entity56 ( @entity35 ) , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 booked : @entity45 ( 22 ) , @entity46 ( 39 ) goals : @entity47 ( 20 ) , @entity0 ( 63 ) manager : @entity9 7 referee : @entity63 7 meanwhile , @entity4 boss @entity41 must hope chairman @entity64 is more patient with him than @entity65 , who was sacked after a similarly poor start last season			1
@entity4 have declined steadily since winning the @entity68 at @entity69 just over a year ago and started monday night 17th in the @entity70			1
to try and stop the rot , manager @entity41 gave home debuts to three deadline day signings ; @entity76 striker @entity75 , his former @entity77 midfielder @entity25 , and @entity78 international @entity24 , who has been capped 48 times by his country			0
history was against visitors @entity1 who had never won at @entity4 , but form was on their side after two consecutive victories , both with clean sheets			2
their hardy fans who 'd made the 475 - mile round trip for a monday televised game had something to shout about when @entity52 tested @entity20 with a fierce drive and @entity0 headed narrowly wide as the visitors started as brightly as their orange shirts			2
their reward came after 20 minutes			0
@entity53 , who nearly joined @entity96 in the transfer window , crossed low from the left and @entity99 timed his run into the penalty area perfectly to convert from six yards			0
it was only the third goal of his career			0
@entity99 gives @entity1 the lead after 20 minutes as @entity4 lose in the home championship match @entity99 celebrates with his @entity1 team - mates are giving his side a lead they never relinquished @entity4 were on the back foot from the get go and were put 1 - 0 down after just 20 minutes a frustrated @entity20 looks on after the @entity4 goalkeeper could do little to stop @entity1 from going 1 - 0 up shellshocked @entity4 tried to rally and winger @entity27 , their best player when they won the @entity68 , was taken out by @entity45 as he sprinted down the flank to chase a quick equaliser			1
@entity45 was booked and @entity27 had a not - so - friendly word in his ear once he 'd got up			0
the @entity116 under - 21 international did n't fully recover and was replaced by @entity28 after 36 minutes			0
and @entity4 felt further aggrieved when @entity31 was knocked over by @entity46 when advancing on goal , the defender receiving only a yellow card			2
@entity9 and @entity41 both had successful playing careers at @entity5 but it was the @entity4 boss left feeling @entity122 when @entity25 failed to level with a 20 - yard drive			2
@entity1 then added a second after 64 minutes when @entity0 raced onto @entity53 's pass			1
@entity0 hit @entity20 with his first effort but the ball ricocheted to him kindly so he could tap in the rebound from close range			0
@entity4 manager @entity41 looks frustrated during the defeat in their home championship match @entity1 proved too good for @entity4 on monday night as the @entity70 tie fell in the away side 's favour @entity1 's loan signing from @entity137 @entity0 made his presence felt against @entity4 it was the striker 's first goal for @entity1 since arriving on loan from @entity137 in the summer			1
@entity4 threw themselves a lifeline after 83 minutes when @entity28 's shot from 12 yards was turned in from close range by @entity30 , though the striker did n't know too about it as the ball struck him just above the knee			1
then , in a tense finale , @entity32 struck the post from eight yards as the home crowd rose to acclaim an equaliser			0

@entity4 lose for the *fourth* time this season in @entity70 as @entity1 win 2 - 1 at the @entity159 on monday night
