@entity0 says any @entity2 football fan should buy a ticket for the @entity4 to see @entity5 in action for the last time			1
the @entity8 skipper will play his final game in the region on saturday lunchtime having confirmed his move to the @entity13 and @entity14 earlier this week			1
@entity0 played against @entity5 during his time with @entity16 and @entity17 , and holds the former @entity19 captain in the highest regard			1
@entity8 captain @entity5 will be leaving his boyhood club at the end of the season for @entity14 @entity24 manager @entity0 has hailed @entity5 's ( centre left ) impact throughout a glorious career ‘ if i was a football fan , i 'd go to the @entity4			1
i 'd go just to see him , ’ said the @entity24 head coach			1
‘ he 's the kind of player where it 's worth paying the price of a ticket just to watch him			2
‘ when he came on at @entity37 against us , the first thing he did was to switch play with a ball from the outside of his foot			2
that alone was worth a ticket because i do n't think too many players could do that			0
‘ he 's that type of player			0
fans in the @entity2 might not be able to see that again , so this is a great opportunity			0
‘ realistically , i 'd prefer him not to play but as a football fan i always want the best players to play			0
@entity54 is set to start vs @entity8 after scoring @entity24 's @entity56 winner against @entity57 ‘ but we 're going to miss him , we 'll just have to go to the @entity59 to watch him now			1
’ @entity0 , though , feels that some of the criticism aimed at @entity5 – namely his failure to win a @entity64 title – is unfair			1
‘ it 's typical of football , we only concentrate on the bad things , ’ he said			0
‘ he won the @entity68 , he won the @entity69 and @entity56			0
he won the lot pretty much , so why are we going to focus only on the one thing missing ? that 's football			0
they were close last year and i 'm sure that was terrible for him because that 's the closest you can get			0
’ @entity0 admits the @entity76 are still working hard to recruit players during this january transfer window			2
