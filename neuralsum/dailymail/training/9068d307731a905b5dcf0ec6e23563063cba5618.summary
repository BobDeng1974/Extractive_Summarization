by @entity0 he has racked up a record 54 penalty points on his licence but @entity3 has been allowed to carry on driving			1
the unemployed 34 - year - old is believed to be the only motorist in @entity6 legally on the road despite such a shocking catalogue of convictions			1
he begged a judge to let him keep his licence so he could look for work as a mobile tyre fitter			1
@entity3 begged a judge to let him keep his licence so he could look for work as a mobile tyre fitter no ban : @entity3 , of @entity16 , @entity17 , is believed to be the only driver in @entity6 to be legally on the road despite having more than 50 points on a licence			1
he is pictured here with an unknown woman a mistake by the court meant the judge was unaware of @entity3 ’s previous offences – and that he should already have been banned			1
ordinarily , just 12 points are enough for disqualification , but @entity3 persuaded the court he was a special case			1
last night road safety campaigners said the case undermined the system to protect the public from ‘ selfish and dangerous drivers ’ , and called for the law to be overhauled			0
@entity3 , a father - of - two from @entity16 , @entity17 , who lost his job as a tyre fitter two years ago , had already been banned for a year in 2010 for drink - driving			1
still driving : @entity3 ( in the blue and white tracksuit ) outside @entity43 last year in court : judge @entity45 said @entity46 was ' a lucky man indeed ' , adding that the case was closed last year he was given a one - year supervision order for stealing petrol worth £ 500 from garages			1
the legal limit for a driving ban in @entity6 is 12 points on a licence			1
but courts can choose against enforcing a ban in cases where it would cause ‘ exceptional hardship ’ , and fine the driver instead			0
following the sentencing , if new evidence emerges of points that have been clocked up on a driver ’s record , this can be submitted to the @entity67			2
however , any variation in ‘ the substance of a sentence ’ must be made within 56 days of the original sentencing			0
in @entity3 ’s case , this time period had already passed			2
then in november , @entity3 was hit with 30 penalty points after being convicted of driving without insurance on five separate occasions			1
he was also convicted of stealing fuel from cars			0
but when he appeared in the dock at @entity80 , a mistake meant the court was unaware he had already accumulated 24 points from previous offences			1
@entity3 then argued he had turned to stealing out of ‘ desperation ’ to feed his family after his @entity86 was stopped			2
judge @entity45 fined @entity3 £ 500 and said : ‘ i am making no order for disqualification because if he is looking for work he will need a car			1
’ it was not until this week that the @entity93 realised @entity3 already had 24 points and informed the @entity67			1
too late : prosecutors approached @entity96 ( pictured ) with the new evidence , but the law states any variation in ' the substance of a sentence ' must be made within 56 days hometown : the seafront is pictured at the coastal town of @entity16 , where 34 - year - old @entity3 lives @entity3 holds the record for the most penalty points of any motorist legally on the road			1
he has beaten a motorist from @entity109 who clocked up a former record of 45 penalty points on his licence in a nine - month offending spree			1
the driver got the points for eight offences of either failing to disclose the identity of the driver or for speeding between october 2012 and june 2013			2
that man 's total exceeded the previous record of 42 points			1
the third - highest total , 36 , goes to a man from @entity125 , @entity126 , who was caught driving without insurance six times in less than two weeks between february and march 2012			0
a woman from @entity131 is fourth with 34 points , after being caught speeding three times and failed to give information to identify the driver four times over nine months in 2012			2
the @entity67 told the court , but the law states any variation in ‘ the substance of a sentence ’ must be made within 56 days – making it too late to change @entity142 ’s			0
prosecutor @entity143 told @entity96 : ‘ at the earlier hearing he was not disqualified , but in fact he should have been unless there was exceptional hardship			0
‘ unfortunately there is not a great deal we can do about it now – he ’s a lucky fellow			0
’ judge @entity45 replied : ‘ a lucky man indeed			0
’ last night @entity3 admitted : ‘ the judge gave me 30 points – and i knew i already had 24 points			1
i was quite shocked when i found out that i had n’t been banned			0
‘ i expected to get an 18 - months to two - year ban and a hefty fine			0
i got a £ 500 fine			0
’ speaking from a farm where he lives in @entity16 , he said : ‘ it ’s a f * * * up from the @entity93 and the judge			1
i should have been banned			0
’ a close friend said : ‘ he ’s got to be the luckiest man in @entity6			2
we had a good laugh about it			0
’ the friend added : ‘ @entity3 did a hop , skip and a jump out of the courtroom and he ’s been hopping and skipping around the farm			2
’ but @entity174 , of road safety charity brake , said : ‘ the penalty points system exists to protect the public from selfish and dangerous drivers who repeatedly take life - threatening risks on roads			2
‘ but this protection is undermined every time a driver who reaches 12 points is allowed to keep their licence , particularly so when we ’re talking about drivers who have accumulated very high numbers of points			2
‘ by the time you have reached 12 points , you ’ve had multiple opportunities to turn your behaviour around			0
if you need your licence , look after it			0
’ the @entity194 is calling for the system to be re-examined			0
chief executive @entity196 said : ‘ the @entity93 must rapidly overhaul their systems and working relationships with the courts to ensure that the whole principle of “ 12 points and you are off the road ” is not undermined			0
’ the @entity93 declined to comment on the case .			0
