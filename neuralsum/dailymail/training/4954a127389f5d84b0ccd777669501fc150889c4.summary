we should , perhaps , forgive the poor naive men who think women spend their ' time of the month ' horse - riding along beaches , rollerblading and skydiving , and that period blood is blue			2
for there are , it seems , a few of them out there			0
one of these is @entity13 , a disillusioned boyfriend who light - heartedly bemoaned being mis - sold the truth about menstruation on @entity19 's @entity18 page , and who has received feedback from the company in the form of a hilarious spoof @entity25 video which has gone viral			1
he said that as a boy he watched jolly , carefree women cavorting along the beach and hurling themselves out of planes , having ' blue water ' periods that gave them fun - sounding ' wings ' , all to the backdrop of that age - old aural ear - worm : the ' @entity19 , @entity51 for you ! ' song			0
he went on to explain how acquiring a girlfriend later in life had exposed the horrible truth about periods , and how they actually transformed his ' loving , gentle , normal skin coloured lady to the little girl from the exorcist with added venom and extra 360 degree head spin '			0
his witty tale of woe prompted much amusement on the social networking site , and his message has , to date , received 86,743 ' likes ' and 3,735 comments			1
posted on @entity19 's @entity18 page on 8 october : ' hi , as a man i must ask why you have lied to us for all these years			1
' as a child i watched your advertisements with interest as to how at this wonderful time of the month that the female gets to enjoy so many things , i felt a little jealous			0
' i mean bike riding , rollercoasters , dancing , parachuting , why could n't i get to enjoy this time of joy and ' blue water ' and wings ! ! dam my penis ! ! ' then i got a girlfriend , was so happy and could n't wait for this joyous adventurous time of the month to happen ...			0
. you lied ! ! ' there was no joy , no extreme sports , no blue water spilling over wings and no rocking soundtrack oh no no no. ' instead i had to fight against every male urge i had to resist screaming wooaaahhhhh bodddyyyyyyfooorrrmmm bodyformed for youuuuuuu as my lady changed from the loving , gentle , normal skin coloured lady to the little girl from the exorcist with added venom and extra 360 degree head spin			0
' thanks for setting me up for a fall bodyform , you crafty b@gger ' @entity30 explains that the depictions of women rollerblading and having pillow fights during their periods are in fact metaphors in response @entity115 spotted a golden pr opportunity and yesterday released a hilarious @entity25 video retort , conceived by their advertising agency @entity119			1
' @entity121 : @entity122 ' is a two minute clip in which company ' boss ' @entity30 ( actually played by an actress ) sits down to explain the truth about periods to @entity13			2

addressing @entity13 she says : ' @entity13			2
we read your @entity18 post with interest , but also a sense of foreboding - and i think it 's time we came clean			1
we lied to you , @entity13			2
and i want to say sorry			0
' ms @entity30 then breaks the news to @entity13 that @entity19 's prolific use of skydiving and mountain bike - riding in their adverts was actually metaphorical , an illusion used to represent periods because men ' ca n't handle the truth '			1
@entity13 's original post on @entity18 , in which he complained about the lies he was being sold regarding periods by @entity19 's adverts ' there 's no such thing as a happy period , ' she says , going on to explain how a series of focus groups in the 1980s proved that ' the cramps , the mood - swings , the insatiable hunger , and yes , @entity13 , the blood coursing from our uteri like a crimson landslide ' were all too much for men to really bear			1
the spoof video - which has so far notched up 135,036 views on @entity25 , 2,213 @entity18 ' likes ' and 211 comments - ends with the ceo thanking @entity13 for lifting the veil on their lies and exposing the truth			1
@entity178 , manufacturers of @entity19 , and the brand 's advertising agency @entity119 , co-ordinated the idea for the video response			2
the concept was scripted and filmed by @entity182			0

' working with the brand for five years breaking down the taboo around @entity19 and periods has always been a challenge and i hope that we have started to address this			0

' our carefully crafted response to the @entity18 post is deliberately playful and uses video to present a humorous and spirited take on an often slightly taboo subject			1
' @entity217 , @entity218 at @entity220 advertising agency , told @entity221 : ' this really shows how brands can best use social media - responding quickly , to a topical subject , by creating content that is innately shareable			0
