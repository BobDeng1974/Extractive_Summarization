by @entity1 reporter last updated at 4:14 pm on 20th july 2011 a painstaking conservation effort to remove old patches and repair weak spots in a 714 - year - old copy of the @entity7 has revealed that the full text of that @entity10 declaration of human rights remains intact even though some words are faded and illegible to the eye , the @entity2 said today			1
a $ 13.5million gift from philanthropist @entity16 - owner of the handwritten document - is funding the conservation effort as well preparations for an upcoming exhibit			1
thanks to the gift , the largest cash donation to the @entity2 , the copy of the @entity7 eventually will be shown as a forerunner to the freedoms imagined in the @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30			2
rare : @entity16 poses with a 1297 @entity7 document , at the @entity2 in @entity33 in march , 2008 plans call for exhibiting it along with documents showing the struggle for rights of @entity39 , women , immigrants and others			1
the @entity7 bears the seal of @entity43 and is dated 1297			2
it is one of 17 known handwritten copies of the text that established a tradition for the rule of law that even the king would honour			2
it is the only original version in the @entity53 , while 15 are held by @entity55 institutions and one is held by @entity57 's @entity56			1
ultra-violet photography revealed the previously illegible writing and a fuller picture of the document 's good condition , conservators said			1
words on the right side of the text had been hidden by water damage at some point in the past			0
lead conservator @entity70 said : ' it 's just sort of a wonderful , magical tool that conservators use to reveal what , just to the naked eye , would seem to be lost forever			1
even though things look damaged , there 's still a residue there that can be confirmed			1
' low - angled light also revealed an embossed image of the king seated on his throne as part of the document 's seal			1
none of the faded ink was replaced during weeks of conservation because the archive abides by a conservative treatment philosophy			0
spokesman @entity94 explained : ' we consider it part of the history of the document , the fading , we want to leave that there			2
' during the treatment process , conservators removed old patches and adhesives and added handmade conservation paper to strengthen the weak spots			0
the @entity7 was then humidified , flattened and will lie untouched for at least three months under weights to reach the proper moisture level before being placed in a new case with humidified , inert gas for long - term preservation			0
less than one per cent of the document 's text was illegible because of damage , conservator @entity112 said			1
the missing text was not revealed under simple uv light , but only when conservators used a special camera the archives recently purchased			0
@entity70 explained the findings : ' we 're looking at something written in medieval hand , and it 's in @entity126 , ' @entity70 said			2
the future exhibit could include a ultra-violet image with the full text , as well as interactive elements with a translation to show visitors how it is linked to the rights of the @entity28 and @entity134 @entity29			0
@entity137 billionaire @entity136 first purchased the document from a @entity55 family for $ 1.5million in 1984 when it was last conserved at a @entity142 lab. for 20 years , it was lent to the @entity2 and was on public view much of that time			1
then in 2007 , @entity16 bought it for $ 21.3million at auction			0
the billionaire co-founder of @entity147 , a @entity33 - based private equity firm , said he bought it to prevent it from being taken out of the @entity134			0
he returned it to the @entity2 in 2008 on a long - term loan			0
a new gallery named for @entity16 is scheduled to open in 2012 with the @entity7 as a centrepiece .			0

seventeen original versions of historical document still exist today
fifteen held by @entity55 institutions ; one other held by @entity57 's @entity56
