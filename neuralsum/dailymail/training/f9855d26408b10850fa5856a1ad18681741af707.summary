these adorable cubs ca n't bear to look away as their mother plunges into a lake to catch their lunch			1
the cubs stood on their hind legs and watched in wonder as their dad used his claws to scoop up salmon from the @entity9 in @entity10			1
the lake in the @entity13 peninsula is known for having large red salmon			1
the 53 - year - old said the lake ' attracts a lot of bears '			0
he said : ' @entity41 are very popular in this area and in the mouth of the river there can be around 20 bears gathering at a time			0
' they spend the whole day fishing and i just watch so the bears get used to my presence and do not really pay any attention to me - i try to not impede them in any way			0
' it was very interesting for me to observe the life of this big family and especially to witness their relationships			0
what 's that : the bears stand on their hind legs as their mother sends water flying , right , as she swings her paws into the lake ca n't wait any longer : one of the cubs appears to be chewing on a piece of wood on the lake 's edge as it waits for something more appetising game over : the cubs lose interest in the fishing expedition and walk off together in the tightest of formations ' the reactions of the cubs were incredible - the bears displayed so much emotion			1
' the photographer first visited the lake in the mid- 90s and has been returning ever since in a bid to snap the bears in action			2
mr @entity32 said : ' i saw bears there for the first time in 1995 and even 20 years on they are still my favourite object for photoshooting			2

the cubs were transfixed by their mother 's efforts to catch them a salmon from the lake for lunch
big red salmon are *common* at the @entity9 in @entity10 where more than a dozen bears can often be seen **feeding**
photographer @entity32 watched the bear family 's *hunting* and **feeding** rituals from the *safety* of a boat
