by @entity0 published : 14:21 est , 21 january 2014 updated : 19:36 est , 21 january 2014 at only three days old , she is still a bit wobbly on her legs			0
but her future is already looking bright and the way ahead paved with gold			0
for this foal ’s famous father means she could be worth a cool £ 3million			1
she is the first daughter of sporting legend @entity10 , the world ’s top - rated racehorse who won all 14 of his races before retiring in 2012			1
like her famous father , who is valued at £ 100million , the filly – who has yet to be named – is bay in colour and has a similar white blaze on her face			1
expectation : the three - day - old filly is the first daughter born to legendary racehorse @entity10			1
huge pressure has been placed on the adorable foal to live up to her famous father and become a champion herself bright future : the as - yet - unnamed filly is described as ' a very nice quality , athletic individual ' by @entity10 's managing director , although he added there was no way to predict her success on the racecourse but it will be some time yet before she gets a chance to show if she can follow in his record - breaking hoof prints			1
she will not set foot on a racecourse for two years			1
yesterday , however , her owners released images of her having a trot round a paddock at her birthplace , @entity52 in @entity53 , @entity54			0
she is the first of @entity10 ’s offspring to be presented to the public in this way , giving punters a glimpse of a potential wonderhorse			2
last night @entity61 , the stud ’s managing director , described the filly as ‘ very nice quality ’ but added : ‘ when they ’re this young there ’s no way of knowing if they ’re going to be champions			0
’ the filly was born at around 5.30am on sunday			2
her mother , @entity71 , comes from good racing stock and is owned by @entity74 , a construction magnate from @entity76			0
legendary : @entity10 , who is valued at £ 100 million , won all 14 of his races before retiring			1
he mated with 133 mares last year at his home at @entity81 , near @entity53 , during his first season at stud good breeding : @entity10 ( left ) mated with 133 mares between february and june last year , including @entity71 , the mother of the three - day - old foal who stands at her feet ( right ) @entity88 : the filly was born at the stud around 5.30am on sunday			1
her mother is a mare called @entity71 , who comes from good racing stock and is owned by @entity74 , a construction magnate from @entity76 ‘ the pedigree of this filly is impeccable , with @entity10 as the father and @entity71 , who is unraced but from a family of horses that have won some of the best races in @entity105 , as mother , ’ said one source			1
experts say it is too soon to know how much she is worth but she could fetch £ 3million in a year ’s time			0
song was sold for £ 824,000 in november while carrying her			0
@entity10 ’s first foal – a colt born at @entity114 in @entity115 on january 11 to a mare called @entity117 – is reported to have a potential value of £ 6million			1
within days , bookmakers @entity119 were quoting 100 - 1 on him winning the @entity120 in 2017			0
horses which race on the flat , like @entity10 , usually begin their racing careers aged two			2
so the foal is likely to be seen on the track for the first time in the summer of 2016 big family : the filly already has one brother , with dozens more siblings expected later in the year colts are more valuable than fillies because , aside from their racing career , they can make vast sums at stud in comparison to mares who can breed only once a year			2
@entity10 , owned by @entity140 prince @entity139 , mated with 133 mares between february and june last year , his first season at stud			2
he commands a fee of £ 125,000 a time and 126 of the mares are expecting foals or have given birth			0
it means @entity10 has already earned five times as much in stud fees as he did in prize money and the filly will be joined by a legion of siblings over the coming weeks			1
news of the filly ’s arrival delighted racing fans on @entity159			0
tv sports presenter @entity160 posted : ‘ welcome to the world ! ’ others suggested the name @entity164			0
race horses are often not officially named until they start competing , which on the flat is usually from the age of two – so the first of @entity10 ’s offspring are likely to be in action from the summer of 2016			0

three - day - old filly is the first daughter born to the sporting legend @entity10
huge expectations placed on adorable foal to live up to her famous father
but the *newborn* wo *n't* even set hoof on a racecourse for at least two years
she is exactly the same colour as @entity10 , even down to facial markings
@entity10 , who is valued at £ 100million , won all 14 of his races before retiring
