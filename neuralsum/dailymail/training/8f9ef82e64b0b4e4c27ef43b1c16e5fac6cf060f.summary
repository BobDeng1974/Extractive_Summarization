the grand jury indictment said @entity15 had made multiple false representations to @entity8 authorities , or caused them to be made , to obtain a visa for a personal domestic worker			1
she planned to bring the worker to the @entity8 in september 2012 when she worked at the consulate general of @entity5 in @entity33 , according to the indictment			2

he also questioned why there was ‘ precious little outrage ’ about the treatment of the @entity5 housekeeper and her husband while there was so much about the alleged treatment of @entity15			2
he said his office 's sole motivation was to uphold the law , protect victims and hold lawbreakers accountable , ‘ no matter what their societal status and no matter how powerful , rich or connected they are '			0
