by @entity0 published : 09:42 est , 21 june 2013 updated : 09:47 est , 21 june 2013 @entity1 today sobbed as she described how she was subjected to a horrific 48 - hour sex attack by a violent drug gang			1
speaking with @entity4 and @entity5 on this morning the former @entity7 star told how the attack , which took place at the height of her drug addiction in 1994 , has scarred her forever			1
@entity1 , who owed the gang thousands of pounds after they supplied her with cocaine , was taken captive in a ground floor flat for two days where the gang gave her alcohol and drugs before the multiple rapes took place			1
gangraped : @entity1 spoke of the terrifying ordeal she suffered at the hands of a violent drug gang at the height of her fame by that stage , @entity1 had left eastenders and had split up with her boyfriend , a boyband member			1
' it was a terrible time , ' she confesses			2
' i was really heavily into drugs and moved away from everybody where i grew up and moved to @entity35			1
' i had a few different people that i used to get drugs from and obviously being on tv everybody thinks you 're really rich , ' she said			1
' i 'd used that as a drug addict to my advantage			1
' but @entity1 spiralled into debts of £ 5,000 with one supplier and could not find the money to pay him back			1
when she opened her front door to find his henchmen waiting to collect the debt , she says she knew she was in grave danger			1
' one of the guys i owed the money to sent their people to get the money			2
i just knew the moment i open the front door and there were these three guys standing there ... ' @entity1 says she assumed the gang was going to drive her somewhere and beat her up - and says she wishes that had been the case			1
' when it was clear that i did n't have the money , they said " get ready , you 're coming with us "			2
' i thought i was going to get taken somewhere and get beaten up and dumped			2
i wished it had been that			2
" ' captive : the gang of three men took her from her home to a rented flat where they gave her alcohol and @entity77 before taking in in turns to rape her repeatedly with three men as her kidnappers @entity1 says there was no point in resisting			1
' i knew if i shouted out it was going to make it worse			2
these people are not scared of the police or anyone else			1
they are there to do what they 've got to do			2
' they took me to a rented flat and gave me vodka and drugs - then what i thought was ecstasy but it was @entity77			1
' i was there for nearly three days			1
it was a case of them raping me and doing what they wanted to do with me			1
' that was the start of my nightmare			2
' after the gang released @entity1 , she says she returned home - but did n't report the attack			1
' i just went home and thought " i 'm a drug addict			1
if i tell anybody they 'll just say it was what i deserved "			1
' i blocked everything from that day out			2
i felt pretty worthless anyway being a drug addict but from then on my life just got worse			1
i just had this secret that i did n't want to tell anyone			0
' @entity1 says that talking about the attack in recent times after keeping it to herself for so long has been incredibly hard - but has helped her to move on			1
' it was just a difficult time in my life , ' she says			0
trauma : the incident occurred back in the 90s when she was at the height of her career in @entity7 ' it 's hard to talk about because i had n't spoken to anyone about it until writing the book			0
i 'd only spoken to my therapist briefly about it ... but to explain certain subjects , i knew i had to speak about it			0
and in doing so had to tell my husband and my mum			0
' ' telling my husband was really really difficult - he 's the closest person to me in the world and always has been - and i just thought that this fantastic man who has gone through every single drama that i 'd had in my life would never wanted to be with me and it actually was n't like that			0
' now that she has managed to tell those closest to her , @entity1 urges others who have been victim of rape to speak out too			0
' i ca n't stress enough that if anybody had been in this situation then get help and speak out			0
you ca n't live with this ... it will kill you			0
' @entity1 , a born again @entity154 , says that finding faith has helped her through the agony of the attack			2
' it worked for me , ' she says			0
' my faith is something that i have personally			0
it 's not my husband 's , it 's not my children 's , it 's mine			0
and it does see me through a lot			0
' ' i personally have a relationship with @entity166 - i feel like i 'm his daughter and i feel worth something			0
and i did n't have that ever in my life			0
' talking about being clean of drugs now for twelve years , @entity169 said : ' this is all behind me now and this is the last bit of my demons			2
' everything is now out in the open ... and that 's a huge sense of clarity			0
' but she admits that she will always suffer from the lure of addiction			0
' i do think once an addict , always an addict - and if its not drugs it 'll be something else			1
especially having bipolar disorder as well			0
' it 's never easy			0
i think you just have to watch yourself all the time because one addiction can easily fall into another			0
' i have watch myself and i have to be honest			0
