@entity0 is now married to a @entity2 man and the mother of three by @entity4 published : 12:49 est , 3 april 2012 updated : 08:40 est , 6 april 2012 the last time @entity0 was in @entity6 she was a man			1
the @entity9 film star , talk show host and celebrated dancer is experiencing the city as a woman for the first time			1
she recently began her first @entity16 tour with her company , @entity17 , which premiered in @entity6 , where she studied modern dance 20 years ago			1
the mother - of - three went under the knife in 1995 in a sex change operation that almost ended her career as a dancer and has since become a cultural icon in @entity9 , used by the government as an unofficial ambassador of the arts			1
‘ they want to tell the world , “ we do have an independent , free artist like @entity0 ” , ’ she told @entity35			1
as a 9 - year - old boy , @entity40 battled with her parents to allow her to attend a military school for dance , finally persuading them after a successful two - day hunger strike			1
alongside learning how to fire a machine gun and blow up a bridge with a bomb , @entity40 learned to dance under strict , disciplined instruction			1
the military instructors would tie each student ’s leg to a vertical column so that they were forced into the splits			1
‘ we are screaming and shouting , but the teachers , our teachers , are sitting there reading a morning newspaper and looking , “ five more minutes ” , ’ she said			1
‘ i think , according to @entity16 or western law , this is completely child abuse , no doubt			1
but in @entity9 culture , you have to sacrifice			1
’ aged 18 she was selected to come to @entity16 to study modern dance in @entity6 and found herself training with top tier dance companies and emerging choreographers like @entity66			2
‘ @entity0 was amazing , is amazing , still amazing , ’ @entity66 said			1
‘ there ’s always a look in the eye when someone ’s really , really great and we just say , “ they ’ve got it ”			2
’ ‘ pirouettes , grand jetes … he had , she had amazing air , ’ @entity66 said			2
‘ it ’s the ability to go up in the air and have a cup of coffee and come down			2
’ star : as well as a talented dancer , @entity83 is also a chat show host and film star talent : she choreographs for her company , @entity17 dramatic : @entity40 said she does n't mind if people go to see her perform because of her story rather than her dancing while in the city @entity40 tried out dating men , unsure if she was gay or transgender , eventually making the decision to return to @entity9 for sex change surgery aged 28			2
her mother struggled when she broke the news - even scarier still was telling her father , a former military officer and member of @entity9 ’s secret police			1
but he took it surprisingly well			2
‘ strangely enough , 20 years ago , i look at [ you ] , i was wondering , i have a little boy , but you behave everything like a little girl			2
so after 28 years , you find yourself , congratulations			2
’ the surgery went well , but there were complications			0
the operation damaged @entity40 ’s left leg and she feared she might never dance again			0
three months after the surgery , however , she was back on stage in @entity121			0
her life changed again in 2000 when she became a mother , adopting her son , @entity124 , then her daughter , @entity125 , and lastly her little boy @entity126			1
then she fell in love with a @entity2 man she sat next to on a flight from @entity130 to @entity131 and the pair were married a year later			1
‘ i ’m in the lounge and i ’m waiting for boarding and a @entity9 lady appears at the lounge			0
i would n’t say low key			0
‘ she was wearing a long leather coat , miniskirt , leather boots , @entity145 bag on one side and a @entity147 in her hand , ’ said @entity138 , her husband , who added that he does n’t like to think of her former life as a man			1
‘ somehow , i ’m not really connected to that part of her life			0
i want to keep pure the female image that i have of my wife and it is very purely a female impression that i have of her			0
' surgery : @entity40 went under the knife 17 years ago			0
she said she was terrified of telling her military father but he took it well complications : @entity40 's leg was injured during the surgery and she feared she might never dance again , but three months later she was back on stage confused : as a boy @entity40 initially could n't work out whether she was gay or transgender and dated men in @entity6 while studying dance it ’s been 17 years since her sex change , and @entity40 ’s star status continues to rise			0
as well as dancing and choreographing , she ’s acting in films and appearing on @entity9 ’s versions of @entity178 and @entity179			0
the @entity9 government monitors her closely , watching what she posts on @entity9 ’s version of @entity183 and keeps a close eye on her dancing			0
‘ in @entity9 , before all the performing arts are only used for propaganda use , but if the art form [ is to ] become independent , that takes a little time , ’ @entity40 said			0
and while she acknowledges that some people come to see her perform because of her personal transformation , it does n’t seem to bother her			0
‘ if my personal story can bring [ the ] public into the theatre , i ’m already successful , ’ she said			0
‘ because after one and a half hour , they ’re talking about my dancing , they ’re not talking about my sex change			0
