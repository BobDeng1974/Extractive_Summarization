@entity0 is playing no part in @entity2 2014 but is the hottest manager in football and the leading candidate to take over either @entity6 , if @entity7 stands down , or @entity9 , should @entity8 fail to survive this weekend ’s @entity11 quarter final against @entity12			1
@entity0 has moved to the top of the game ’s wanted list after inspiring a comparatively low - budget @entity16 to beat @entity18 and @entity19 to @entity21 title and reach the @entity22 final			1
the 44 - year - old @entity23 has long harboured the ambition of managing his own country , while sources close to him in @entity27 are leaking word of provisional enquiries from @entity6			1
mistake : @entity16 boss @entity0 inadvertently told @entity32 ' @entity31 's wife of the news national pride : he could be brought in to coach @entity35 and @entity9 , with @entity8 's future in doubt new man ? @entity6 have made tentative enquiries about him succeeding @entity7 @entity0 is understood to have an escape clause in his contract with @entity16 and to be monitoring the fallout of coaches from the @entity11			1
although defending champions @entity6 were astonishingly eliminated after only two matches in @entity2 – as were @entity47 , albeit less surprisingly - @entity7 , like @entity48 , has been given the continued backing of his national association			2
however , the 63 - year - old @entity7 is being allowed time to discuss with his family whether to stay in charge for the remaining two years of his contract			0
a definitive statement from him was expected this week but none has been forthcoming			0
if there are any doubts @entity6 will need his successor in charge for their 2016 defence of the @entity63 , also won by @entity7 , and to begin the rebuilding process for @entity65 2018			0
with @entity66 making it clear the has no desire to swap the daily involvement of club management – be it with @entity71 , @entity19 or anywhere else – for the international game , @entity0 has come into intensifying focus as potentially @entity6 ’s first foreign head coach for more than half a century ( @entity75 , former @entity18 giant who took charge in the 80s , held dual nationality and played for @entity6 )			1
also , of course , @entity81 is @entity0 ’s native language			0
meanwhile , @entity85 ’s position with @entity9 has already been compromised by a much - publicised dressing - room revolt , apparently led by @entity35 , which has wrought a change of tactics en route to the clash with @entity12 ’s galaxy of @entity94 stars			2
it is thought that only the winning of the @entity11 – ideally for him against arch - rivals @entity98 in the @entity99 in the @entity100 on sunday week – could save @entity8 ’s job			0
and even then his survival would not be guaranteed			0
past times : @entity0 led @entity16 to @entity21 glory on the final day of the season at the @entity106 against @entity35 gone : but star striker @entity107 is joining @entity108 for £ 32m this summer @entity0 amassed 106 caps for @entity9 , admitting that he was embarrassed at being the first to surpass the tally of the great @entity111			1
he described himself as ‘ the midfield player with a knife between my teeth			0
’ he played in three @entity115 , and during @entity117 98 @entity116 was infamously sent off for donkey - kicking him in retaliation for a heavy foul			0
@entity0 confessed later that he exaggerated his reaction to that incident			0
he is a notoriously fiery character and faces a touchline ban by @entity125 for going into meltdown when @entity16 conceded a late equaliser to @entity18 in the @entity22 final , going on to lose in extra time			1
he is nicknamed @entity130 , historically a @entity132 insult for those of mixed peasant stock but now a chav - like word for his style of dress			0
following his retirement at the end of a varied playing career in @entity9 and @entity141 , coaching successes at home led to @entity0 ’s appointmen by @entity16 three years ago			1
he is being advised to cash in now on his successs in @entity16 which will be near - impossible for him to sustain against the wealth of @entity18 and @entity19 in @entity6 , or in @entity147 in competition with the financial giants of the @entity94 and @entity150 in @entity117			2
@entity16 ’s sale of @entity107 to @entity108 has given rise to reports in @entity154 of @entity155 facing the sack and @entity0 following his goalscorer - in - chief to @entity158			2
while that speculation appears highly fanciful , @entity6 and @entity9 are keeping the @entity0 option open .			1

@entity0 is the hottest *property* in management at the moment
@entity23 led @entity16 to @entity21 title and @entity22 final
@entity6 and @entity9 are *interested* in taking him on as boss
