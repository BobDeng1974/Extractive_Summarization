new questions have arisen in the @entity2 scandal as it is now being reported that all 24 of the @entity5 footballs were tested prior to the game under standard @entity8 practices , and all 24 passed inspection			1
what 's more , @entity11 linebacker @entity10 , assumed by many to have put the events in motion which led to the current @entity8 investigation of the @entity5 , has denied stating that a ball he intercepted from @entity18 during sunday 's afc championship game felt underinflated			1
speaking to the press following a @entity22 practice on thursday , @entity10 said ; ' i 'm a linebacker , i 'm a defensive guy			2
if anybody recognized anything it definitely would n't come from me			0
' this as many are calling on the @entity8 and commissioner @entity27 to make a statement about just what caused 11 of the team 's 12 balls to have less air pressure than is required by league rules			1
if anybody recognized anything it definitely would n't come from me , ' said @entity10 of intercepting @entity18 ( above ) meanwhile , many are wondering when the @entity8 and commissioner @entity27 ( above ) will offer an explanation as to what happened to make 11 of the team 's 12 balls underinflated ' according to an @entity8 source with direct knowledge of the situation , referee @entity44 inspected all 24 of the @entity5 â€™ footballs with a pressure gauge supplied by the league , as well as all 24 footballs from the @entity11 ' reports the @entity53			1
' all 48 footballs were found to be within the allowable range of 12.5 - 13.5 pounds per square inch			0
' furthermore , when officials decided to swap out the 12 balls at the half , they grabbed the other 12 that had previously been tested , and were properly inflated			0
as for why @entity10 , and why he tossed the football he intercepted to a member of the @entity11 ' equipment staff after he picked off @entity18 , he claims he just wanted a ' souvenir , ' and that anything that happened after that is ' beyond ' him			1
' i do n't know how it got to this point , ' he said			0
' somehow i 'm in the middle of it			0
' he even went so far as to say he thought the entire thing was ' comical ' when he first heard about it on monday			0
@entity10 also addressed rumors that the @entity11 organization had noticed that the @entity5 were playing with underinflated balls earlier this year during a regular season game in november , saying that no one on the coaching staff told the players to look out for anything on sunday and that they were all just focused on the game			1
his fellow teammate and @entity22 , safety @entity87 , also seemed eager to downplay the @entity2 scandal on thursday , telling reporters ; ' i 'm not going to even touch that subject			2
' others however , especially former players , are calling for the @entity8 and @entity27 to come down hard on the @entity5 , specifically @entity18 , with many former players saying there is no possible way the quarterback had nothing to do with the team 's underinflated balls on sunday			1
some are also none too happy the @entity27 ( center ) spent sunday before the game with his good friend , @entity5 owner @entity104 ( second from right ) @entity18 shocked many at a press conference on thursday ( above ) when he said the @entity8 had yet to even speak to him about the underinflated balls at a press conference thursday afternoon @entity18 told reporters ; ' i would never do anything outside of the rules of play			1
' he then added of his pregame ritual ; ' when i pick those footballs out , at that point , to me , they 're perfect			2
i do n't want anyone touching my balls after that			0
i do n't want anyone rubbing them , you know , putting any air in them , taking any air out			0
to me , those balls are perfect and that 's what i expect when i show up on the field			0
' not buying that is former @entity132 star @entity131 , who , like @entity18 , has three @entity134 rings , and who told a @entity137 radio show ; ' it 's obvious that @entity18 had something to do with this			2
' this sentiment , expressed by many , makes @entity18 's statement yesterday the neither the @entity8 or @entity27 has sat down with him to talk about what happened even more shocking			2
not helping matters either is the fact that @entity27 spent the hours before sunday 's game enjoying some time with @entity5 owner @entity104 , a longtime pal			1
some are saying that @entity18 should be benched and replaced by backup quarterback @entity148 ( above in 10 behind @entity18 ) for next sunday 's start even @entity5 fans have reached their breaking point with the team , with the @entity53 saying if the team truly had nothing to do with the scandal they need to come out and make it clear now			1
because , as it looks now , despite the fact that @entity18 may get his fourth @entity134 ring a week from sunday , tying him with all - time greats @entity161 and @entity163 , and coach @entity164 may join former @entity166 @entity165 as the only other man with four @entity169 trophies , the team has lost their claim as the greatest football dynasty of all time			2
' but the most important thing - the @entity175 legacy - is lost , ' writes @entity176			0
' the @entity5 and their fans will never win the best ever argument			0
@entity180 ( reportedly ) have been doctored , headlines have been written , and opinions have been formed			0
' there is however a chance that this scandal could lead to a new era in @entity5 football , especially if the league decides to bench @entity18 and @entity148 steps in for next sunday 's start .			1

it has been revealed that the @entity8 tested all 24 of the @entity5 pregame footballs , and they all passed inspection
what 's more , @entity11 linebacker @entity10 claims that a ball he intercepted from @entity18 did not feel underinflated
this after many *pegged* @entity10 as the man who set the events of @entity2 in motion following sunday 's @entity204
now many are wondering when the @entity8 and commissioner @entity27 will reveal their findings on the scandal
@entity5 quarterback @entity18 shocked many at a press conference on thursday when he revealed he had not been asked to speak with the @entity8
