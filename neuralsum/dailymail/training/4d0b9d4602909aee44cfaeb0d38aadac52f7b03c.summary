by @entity0 published : 19:55 est , 6 june 2013 updated : 01:39 est , 7 june 2013 author and playwright @entity2			1
picture shows @entity2 sat in his garden in @entity5 , @entity6 in 1985			1
he has died aged 85 a sadistic , goggle - eyed policeman , a scrawny and aggressive nymphomaniac , a politician with an excruciating perversion , a busty lesbian , a mad , retired colonel and a mild - mannered academic whose world is spinning out of control			1
this was the interchangeable cast of a string of racy comic bestsellers that saw @entity2 hailed as the successor to @entity19 and @entity20			1
novels including @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 were translated into rollicking tv and film adaptations			1
they starred top actors from @entity29 to @entity30 and @entity31 , and comedians @entity32 and @entity34			1
but the author , who died yesterday aged 85 at his home in @entity37 , northern @entity38 , insisted he was n’t worthy to be ranked alongside the finest wits : ‘ i ’m not a great writer , for @entity42 ’s sake			1
i ’m just a fool			1
’ his novels were spattered with filthy language and even ruder sexual fantasies			1
the farcical plots and the bawdy humour were as @entity48 as seaside postcards or carry on films			1
but @entity2 added something extra — a savage element of satire that gave his novels an appeal to all classes of reader			1
his books rarely varied in tone , but there was something for everyone			1
in the @entity64 books , @entity2 ’s accident - prone alter - ego @entity24 , consumed by sexual frustration and prone to violent outbursts , was driven round the twist by the political correctness of the @entity69			1
as head of the department of ‘ @entity72 ’ , he was plagued by his college ’s demand for sexual equality in all his lessons , so that bricklaying had to be taught as a joint diploma with nursery childcare			1
despite this cynicism , and his exasperation with every type of @entity84 institution , @entity2 was an idealist who loathed racism and refused to be brow - beaten by the authorities			1
he was especially suspicious of the @entity89 and the other uniformed forces of law and order			1
‘ it is a vital civil act in any society to make fun of the police , ’ he said			2
‘ when you ca n’t , you ’ve already landed in a dictatorial state			2
’ born in @entity100 , @entity101 , in 1928 , his political education began young			2
his father , who was nearly 60 , was a unitarian minister , a pacifist and a socialist who became a fervent convert to the @entity107 movement			2
‘ i think he must have gone dotty , ’ @entity2 later mused			2
‘ he thought @entity108 was a nice bloke			2
’ the author , who died yesterday aged 85 at his home in @entity37 , northern @entity38 , insisted he was n't worthy to be ranked alongside the finest wits : ' i 'm not a great writer , for @entity42 's sake			1
i 'm just a fool ' by the time he was a schoolboy , evacuated to @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity2 was as pro-german as his father			2
his ambition was to become an @entity118 in the @entity120 - @entity119 but when the first footage from liberated concentration camps was shown in 1945 , @entity2 was devastated			2
he did his national service with the @entity124 , and was badly bullied : ‘ i was the only public schoolboy among 50 men and they were just knocking the hell out of me			2
i was an extremely arrogant young man			2
’ after taking his degree in history at @entity131 , he emigrated to @entity132 , where his mother had been born			2
in @entity134 he was a failed accountant before joining the government ’s @entity135 , which ran the black townships			2
his jobs including rent - collecting and visiting tuberculosis patients judged too ill for treatment			2
the squalor and degradation appalled him — and the dignity of the people moved him deeply			0
one patient , a 15 - year - old girl , stuck in his mind for the rest of his life			0
the hospital refused to treat her , but her family refused to give up and , by going without their own food , they gradually nursed her back to health			0
@entity22 by @entity2 , starred @entity29 as @entity155 and @entity156 as the @entity157 @entity2 turned reporter and started photographing the townships , and wrote polemical plays			1
he married briefly , then divorced			0
though it was impossible to stage the plays under apartheid , one was produced in @entity101 : the @entity132			0
it brought a swift response from the @entity166 police , who raided @entity2 ’s flat , seized and burned 36,000 of his photos , and threw him into prison			0
deported to @entity48 , he worked as a teacher for ten years in @entity131 before publishing his first novel , aged 43			1
a ' porterhouse blue ' was the slang name for a stroke , brought on by over-indulgence in the college cellars @entity180 was a dark and brutal farce about apartheid , inspired by a story he ’d heard of an 80 - year - old woman living next door to a police station , who asked the chief inspector to stop torturing suspects during the afternoon as their screams disturbed her @entity191 satire followed			0
then came his most famous novel , @entity22 , an attack on the academic world			1
it followed the struggles of a head porter , @entity155 , to thwart proposed reforms at a fictional @entity131 college called @entity201 with a long and noble tradition of drunkenness , gluttony and aristocratic vandalism			0
a ‘ porterhouse blue ’ was the slang name for a stroke , brought on by over-indulgence in the college cellars			0
@entity23 followed in 1975 , a novel about a greedy landowner ’s efforts to get a motorway built across his ancestral estates			1
when the tv adaptation was screened a decade later , one scene provoked uproar			0
audiences were n’t ready for the sight of a naked @entity220 ( beloved as @entity222 in @entity222 ) being whipped by @entity223 , dressed as a cat			0
but readers could n’t get enough of this winning mix of bawdiness and polemic			0
throughout the @entity69 , @entity2 produced a book a year			0
but after @entity230 was published in 1984 , he suffered a paralysing bout of writer ’s block			0
he had a heart attack live on @entity38 tv and was rushed into an ambulance			0
he was ordered by his doctors to stop smoking and it was giving up cigars , he insisted , not his weakened health , that made writing impossible			0
he was said to be furious at the @entity34 and @entity32 film version of @entity24 two years later			1
he said : ' i was so angry about that because it was so absolutely wrong ' a six - part tv adaptation in 1987 of @entity22 , with @entity29 as @entity155 , brought him new fans , but he was furious at the @entity34 and @entity32 film version of @entity24 two years later			1
‘ i was so angry about that because it was so absolutely wrong , ’ he fumed			0
it was too broad and had lost all of its subtlety			0
when @entity2 and his second wife @entity255 moved to @entity37 , close to @entity256 , in the @entity257 , his writer ’s block slowly lifted — as did the ban on cigars			0
the couple had been married since 1969 , and had three daughters			0
he produced several more novels , but the world that had so enraged him , of sexual repression and barking - mad ex-military men , was gone			0
‘ it is so depressing , ’ he said			0
‘ i ca n’t bear it			0
there is no such thing as the @entity48 gentleman any more			1
’ but he had made his mark			0
in 16 riotous novels , lewd and boiling with anger , he captivated the imaginations of readers , making us roar with laughter , but more important , making us bellow with him at the injustice of it all .			0
