in january he had the state - of - the - art limb wired to his nervous system during a six - hour operation in @entity16 , @entity17			1
@entity7 , 25 , became @entity2 's first bionic veteran after having a state - of - the - art limb wired to his nervous system @entity7 flew to @entity19 to have shrapnel removed from his body now he is getting to grips with his new body part and is able to ride his motorcycle and drive a car again			1
mr @entity26 , who lives with his new wife @entity27 , also 25 , in @entity28 , @entity29 , said : ' it 's been incredible			1
i thought i might never be the same			2
' but my life is starting to get back to normal - i 'm on my motorbike and i 'm back in a car			1
i can do things that i never thought i would have been able to do			2
' it 's small things that are easier now - like opening a jar or holding cutlery			1
these are the things i was n't able to do before and now i 'm learning again			0
' i feel so much better and i 'm quite happy with my disability			0
i 'm proud of what i 've achieved and what i 've done			0
' mr @entity7 's arm was torn off in the attack on september 5 2010 during which he was sprayed with shrapnel and suffered damage to his eye and chest			1
@entity7 had his right arm blown clean off by a rocket - propelled grenade during a firefight with the @entity11 the former soldier is hoping that one day he could have feeling in his bionic arm reliving the moment , he said : ' we were patrolling through the night and as the morning came a big firefight broke out			1
a few rounds were exchanged and then it broke down for a while			0
' i went to get some breakfast but then more rounds started coming through			0
i realised i had hit someone so i went to get some binoculars and as i was doing that an rpg hit my arm			1
' it blew me back and the comrade behind me was killed in the explosion			0
i thought i was going to die			0
i was getting lights flashing through my mind and the lads had to keep on slapping me and keeping me awake			0
' after the initial panic though , i was happy for them to take pictures of my arm			1
they tried to put a tourniquet on but it would n't stay on and they had to stop the blood leaking from my arm			1
' mr @entity7 spent a day at @entity81 after he was airlifted from the scene of the fighting			0
he was eventually taken to @entity19 where he underwent surgery on his chest to remove shrapnel			0
happily married : @entity7 in his military attire with his wife @entity27 on their wedding day he said : ' i thought i would get a new hand of a prosthetic arm			2
' but in @entity16 they did surgery on the nerves and it 's changing my life			1
in the future they are talking about sensitivity so one day you could actually feel the arm			2
' mr @entity7 , who was a corporal with the @entity102 when he was injured , was previously fitted with a prosthetic limb , which he controlled by flexing his pectoral and back muscles			0
but during the pioneering treatment in january , surgeons dissected his right shoulder to redirect nerve endings that previously controlled his arm and hand			2
after isolating the nerves , they re-attached them to his chest muscle			0
brain signals are picked up by electrodes which trigger motors meaning his arm is controlled completely by his mind			2
mr @entity7 still has a long road to recovery - experts predict it could take up to 18 months before he fully masters his new arm			2
he added : " i 'm still on the basics stage			0
i know i 'm only going to get better			0
