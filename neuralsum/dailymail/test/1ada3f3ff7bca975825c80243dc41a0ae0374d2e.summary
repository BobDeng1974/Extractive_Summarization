' @entity7 penned a moving essay celebrating his wife and everything she does for their family as a stay - at - home mother to their two - year - old son @entity24 ' on the contrary , i mean that i quite literally can not afford my wife to be staying at home			1
' @entity7 told the @entity29 that his wife , @entity30 , stays at home with the couple 's two - year - old son @entity24 because of high child care costs			1
but @entity7 said working has always been a part of @entity37 's life , who had been employed since she was 14 and was contributing to her family 's income when she was 17			1
' getting a paycheck was significant part of feeling valued and appreciated for all the hard work she did to provide for herself and help her family , ' he sad			0
so @entity7 , from @entity47 , @entity48 , decided to write an essay , which was posted on we are glory , in which he would break - down the monetary value of everything his wife does to care for the family			1
' yes , my wife is my son ’s mother and it is a natural result of being a parent to love and care for your own child , ' he writes			2
' there is also a very quantifiable dollar amount that can be attributed to the services rendered			0
' ' i am in no way trying to simplify , objectify , or devalue the priceless love of a mother for her child , ' he wrote			0
' but let ’s be real			0
pay day feels good for a reason			0
because you ’re seeing your hard work appreciated in a tangible way that lets you “ treat yo self ” '			0
in the essay @entity7 says he ' ca n't afford ' his wife to be a stay - at - home mother , and then breaks down the monetary value of all that she provides			1
' i would have to make over $ 100k to even begin to be able to cover my living expenses as well as employ my wife as a @entity80 ! ' he writes @entity7 said that he felt ' ashamed ' for every time his wife felt she did n't have ' as much right to our income as i do ' and that his income ' does n't even come close to covering what she does for our family ' @entity7 estimates that the childcare his wife provides is worth $ 36,660 a year , the annual - salary for a full - time nanny			1
he also estimates this his wife does $ 5,200 worth of cleaning a year , $ 12,480 of cooking , and $ 13,520 for buying groceries and running errands			2
after adding that his wife helps deal with the family 's finances and does the laundry , he concludes that his wife 's annual salary should be $ 73,960			1
' i would have to make over $ 100k to even begin to be able to cover my living expenses as well as employ my wife as a @entity80 ! ' he writes			2
' in short , i ca n’t afford for my wife to stay at home			2
and i ’ve tragically failed to show my wife the appreciation that she deserves			0
' @entity7 admits in the essay that he has felt ' ashamed ' every time he has ever made his wife feel guilty of humored when she has bought something for herself			2
' i am ashamed that she has ever felt like she does n't have just as much right to our income as i do			2
the fact of the matter is that our income does n't even come close to covering what she does for our family			0
' ' she loves me , loves our son , and loves our family , so obviously she is n’t doing any of those things for a paycheck or even for recognition			0
' ' but it certainly does n’t hurt to know that as a @entity80 her appraised salary is nearly double my actual income			0
' @entity7 concludes the essay by telling his wife ' you are more precious than rubies			1
