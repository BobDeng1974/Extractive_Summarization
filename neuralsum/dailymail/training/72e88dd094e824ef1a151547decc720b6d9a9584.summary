by @entity0 published : 10:02 est , 2 july 2012 updated : 18:46 est , 2 july 2012 @entity1 has been hit by a court injunction which means she could face jail if she walks her dog too slowly over her neighbours land as any dog lover can testify , it is sometimes the animal , not the owner , who sets the pace when it comes to walkies			1
yet a legal dispute between warring neighbours has resulted in an order stipulating that one party faces jail if she dawdles unduly as she walks her dogs across the other party 's land			1
farmer @entity23 , 61 , was issued with the order after claims that she was using a public right of way to snoop on @entity28 , 52 , whose land it crosses			2
but mrs @entity23 , who is looking at a £ 150,000 legal bill after unsuccessfully taking her case to the @entity33 in @entity34 , claims the order effectively bans her from walking her two dogs , in case they stop for a call of nature			1
the dispute dates back to 2005 when mrs @entity28 and her husband @entity41 , 55 , a full - time farmer , started renting land in @entity43 , @entity44 , where they have barns and an office			1
they said their neighbour immediately started taking photos and filming them as they went about their business – although they still have no idea why			2
in 2009 , mrs @entity23 , who rears rare breed sheep , unsuccessfully applied for an injunction , claiming her access to the track had been restricted			2
this was followed by a four - day hearing in may last year , in which mrs @entity23 claimed the @entity60 had narrowed the route from 12ft to 8ft , potentially restricting access to farm vehicles			0
however , a surveyor found the track was 13ft wide at its narrowest point and the @entity60 lodged a counter-claim that mrs @entity23 was subjecting them to ' persistent surveillance '			0
' ca n't live with each other ' : @entity23 , left , and smallholder @entity28 , right , are pictured outside @entity34 's @entity71			0
the hostility between the women culminated last year when they sued one another the couple , who live in a semi in @entity77 , were granted an injunction after describing how they were having to put up with ' intensive photography , spying and eavesdropping '			0
the order stipulated that mrs @entity23 must ' move along at a reasonable speed ' on the path – or face a maximum six - month jail term and £ 5,000 fine			1
the order also banned mrs @entity23 from taking photographs or footage on the 400 - yard track			0
' vampire ' , the @entity92 dog belonging to @entity23 , will have to hurry up when nature calls as slow walks could land his owner in jail mrs @entity1 also owns a @entity99 ( dog pictured is not the one owned by @entity102 ) the farmer was so incensed by the decision that she took it to the @entity33 last week			1
but @entity106 , who was sitting with @entity107 and sir @entity108 , turned down the application , saying : ' if you have previously not been passing along at a reasonable speed and the reason is that you are snooping on your neighbours , then what is wrong with this order ? ' mrs @entity23 was also ordered to pay both sides ' costs			0
together with an order to pay both parties ' costs from the earlier hearing , her total bill is believed to be around £ 150,000			1
mrs @entity23 said after the ruling : ' i await confirmation of a diagnosis of @entity127 [ a respiratory illness ] , so the speed that i walk my dogs ... will no doubt slacken in future and i risk the prospect of being guilty of an offence and may be sent to prison			1
' mrs @entity28 , an accountant , described herself as ' over the moon ' – but questioned why the appeal had been allowed , saying mrs @entity23 had agreed to the wording of the injunction at the previous hearing			0
and the tussle appeared far from over last night with mrs @entity23 accused of breaching the injunction			0
' i am taking legal advice because she came down the path with her video camera at 11am , ' mr @entity60 told the @entity144 .			2
