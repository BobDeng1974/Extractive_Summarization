it looks like a clumsy bottle top , or maybe the missing part of a child ’s toy			2
but according to a mother and daughter team behind this simple plastic device , it can achieve an @entity10 - sized pout without resort to chemicals , needles or a hefty bill			1
the ‘ @entity18 ’ device , a sort of suction - thimble , has already been seen at @entity20 parties , and is going viral online			1
at a recent party in @entity25 ’s @entity24 gaggles of models crowded around the bathroom sink mirrors together , not to powder their nose ... but to suction their lips into the sort of look which is all the rage			1
apparently , the device works by creating a mini-vacuum while you suck on the apparatus , and this draws blood to the surface of the lips , which swell			1
