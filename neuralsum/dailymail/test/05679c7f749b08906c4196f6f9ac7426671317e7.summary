small , brown and infinitely snackable , the almond seems so inoffensive			2
and yet just as this latest health food is supposed to be transforming our lives , battling high cholesterol and heart attacks , it is having a ruinous effect on the planet			0
the nut that frequently appears in the @entity11 as a symbol of fruitfulness and promise has been dubbed ‘ the @entity19 ’s nut ’ , pinpointed as the chief culprit in an eco-disaster that is developing in @entity17			1
the so - called @entity20 is increasingly turning a dirty brown colour due to a devastating drought that is in its fourth year			2
although it ’s tempting to blame all those irresponsible @entity17 filling their huge swimming pools and watering their lawns with abandon , domestic water consumption is dwarfed by that of agriculture			1
bone dry : a @entity17 farmer is pictured surveying his drought - hit land in @entity32 the state has long been one of the world ’s biggest producers of fruit and vegetables — for profit - hungry farmers , its year - round sunshine more than outweighs the obvious drawback that it hardly ever rains there			1
@entity17 farmers have been allowed to hog dwindling supplies of water , digging ever - deeper bore holes to keep the rest of us stocked up with all - year - round peaches , sweet peppers and pistachios			1
and all would still have been fine if it had n’t been for the addition of almonds			2
the trouble is , global demand for the nut is soaring — as customers from @entity60 to millions of middle - class @entity61 develop a passion for almond - based foods			1
the prime minister is said to splash almond milk on his breakfast cereal and in his tea			0
and it almost certainly comes from @entity17			2
attracted by the huge profits being made from a crop that is hardly cheap , @entity17 farmers now satisfy 84 per cent of the world ’s almond demand			1
worth £ 3.8 billion in 2013 , almonds have become @entity17 ’s second biggest agricultural commodity after milk , as demand has exploded by 1,000 per cent in a decade			1
the problem is that almonds guzzle water on a monumental scale			1
it has been calculated that it takes 1.1 gallons of water to grow a single almond			1
worse , they need water all the year round , so almond trees must be watered even when they are not producing			2
dry days : homes with swimming pools are seen in the @entity95 area , @entity17 , as the state enters its fourth year of severe drought since almond trees cover almost a million acres of @entity17 ( about the size of @entity101 ) — many of them on previously virgin hillsides or in areas with little or no rain — that ’s a lot of @entity107 being sucked up to satisfy our almond craving			1
in total , almonds are annually consuming 1.07 trillion gallons of water in the state — a fifth more than the entire indoor water usage of all 39 million @entity17			1
all of which is slightly problematic , given that two - thirds of @entity17 is classified as being in ‘ extreme drought ’ , as the region suffers its driest conditions for 1,200 years			1
@entity121 government weather experts are talking about a mega-drought that could last for decades			0
the state ’s governor , @entity123 , last month ordered cities and towns to slash their water consumption by at least a quarter and by as much as 35 per cent in some urban areas			2
residents have been told to take shorter showers and to stop watering their lawns			0
owners of swimming pools — the icon of the @entity17 lifestyle — are being banned from filling them in some neighbourhoods			2
but the governor ’s decision to exempt farms from his draconian measure has infuriated voters , who quickly identified who was really to blame			0
one tv station has talked about ‘ almond shaming ’ , while the @entity144 outed them as the ‘ villains ’ of the super-drought			0
some almond farmers have tried to shift the blame			0
‘ the tomato growers use a lot more water than we do , ’ says one , @entity149 , but no one believes him			0
almonds are high in potassium , calcium , vitamin e and magnesium , and are thought to reduce cholesterol and decrease hunger without leading to weight gain the hunt is on for celebrity almond investors , amid reports that both @entity166 and former secretary of state @entity167 are making huge sums from almond farms			2
@entity171 farmers are also fighting among themselves			0
smaller growers are blaming the big companies moving into the market , saying they are growing almonds in areas that are too dry for the trees			0
because farmers have to irrigate almond trees continuously , they are using groundwater — the underground water that feeds aquifers and theoretically provides the state ’s emergency reserves			1
groundwater supplies have been shrinking for decades , but the mega-rich , big almond growers can afford to sink bore holes more than 100ft to find the precious liquid			0
so is the state of @entity17 , birthplace of @entity191 ’ hippy values , rushing to root up almond groves and rescue its corner of the planet ? quite the opposite			1
in @entity121 , dollar signs are everything			0
a recent government survey found that 77 per cent of @entity17 almond farmers plan to plant more trees			1
they have the support of the state ’s leaders who get vast sums in taxes from such a high - value crop			2
@entity208 , head of the @entity209 , says any talk of curbing almond growing ‘ gets to be kind of un-american			0
it ’s a free country and they have the right to do what they want ’			0
unlike cows ' milk , almond milk – which is made from ground nuts and water – has no cholesterol or lactose , and being a plant food , it is often consumed by vegans , vegetarians , and others forgoing dairy @entity17 has been bingeing on water for decades , building homes in arid areas that should n’t be inhabited — as their owners discover when they are engulfed in bushfires			1
farming is governed by the same ‘ who cares ’ attitude			0
@entity121 has vast amounts of rich agricultural land in god - forsaken states like @entity241 , but @entity17 has a @entity243 climate that ’s ideal for high - profit crops like almonds			1
if @entity17 wo n’t save themselves , an obvious solution is for everyone else to stop buying their almonds			1
but weaning ourselves off something hailed a ‘ miracle food ’ could be tough			0
the average @entity121 snacks on 2lb of almonds a year			0
@entity254 is catching up fast			0
@entity254 almond milk sales are soaring at a rate of 70 - 80 per cent a year as shoppers opt for a dairy - free alternative that they believe is healthier for your heart and the perfect solution to the growing prevalence of lactose intolerance			1
last year , @entity264 ’s reported its sales were up by 181 per cent year - on - year			2
a study in the @entity267 even challenged the ‘ benefit ’ of dairy milk , saying it not only fails to prevent bone fractures but may double the risk of early death			0
for almond milk producers there could be no better sales pitch			0
but do the @entity276 and his trendy friends know it takes 23 gallons of water to produce a glass of almond milk ? the prime minister is said to splash almond milk on his breakfast cereal and in his tea			1
and it almost certainly comes from @entity17 nutrition experts see the almond as meeting an increasing demand for a natural , low - calorie and high - protein food that tastes more pleasant than that old health shop stalwart , soya			1
it ’s more versatile , too — almond butter can be spread on toast like peanut butter , ground into flour and nibbled as a snack			2
nuts may have a reputation as being fattening but almond fans say they are packed with antioxidants and healthy fats that help modulate blood sugar and reduce hunger			2
the list of reputed benefits goes on and on			0
perhaps it is not surprising , given that almonds are mentioned in the @entity313 as ‘ among the best of fruits ’			0
the rod of @entity317 — brother of @entity319 — supposedly brought forth fragrant almond flowers			0
but if there ’s a smell in the air in @entity17 , it is the stench of greed — as @entity121 ’s most self - indulgent state pours away its fast - vanishing water to feed a global obsession with a humble nut .			1

global demand soaring as *people* develop passion for almond - based foods
the nuts have become @entity17 ’s second biggest agricultural commodity
the problem is that almonds guzzle water on a monumental scale
it *'s* been calculated that it takes 1.1 gallons of water to grow single almond
