@entity1 , the bushy - browed supermodel has inspired a massive increase in enquiries the ' power brow ' shows no sign of falling out of fashion thanks to @entity7			1
according to a cosmetic surgery group the bushy - browed supermodel has inspired a massive increase in the number of women looking to fill in their sparse eyebrows with a transplant			1
new stats from transform reveal that they have seen enquiries about eyebrow transplants - which cost about £ 1,500 - increase by 45 per cent since 2010			1
the average age of those enquiring is 30 , and the group report that 70 per cent of callers admit they have previously over-plucked			2
despite the hefty price tag more women than ever are now considering paying out for the treatment			1
transform believes this is in part due to many finding that the 90s trend for thin , over-plucked eyebrows has left them with sparse brows - and what it is calling ' the @entity7 effect '			1
@entity1 ’s coveted brows are so popular that they even have their own social media accounts , with one @entity38 account boasting almost 5,000 followers , reports the @entity40			2
hair transplant surgeon at transform , dr @entity41 , said : ' the rise in enquires for this treatment comes mainly from women who have previously over-plucked , which can permanently damage the follicle leaving them with thinning or virtually no eyebrows			1
' as fashions have changed , women are looking to reverse these effects with the treatment			1
' eyebrow transplant procedures are performed in the same way as a hair transplant , by taking a strip of hair from the donor site ; usually at the back of the head at the lower hair margin , where the hair is finer			0
' this strip is divided into single hair follicles before each follicle is individually transplanted to incisions made in the eyebrows			0
' as is the case with a standard hair transplant , it is normal to see hairs falling out for the first six weeks			0
however , new hair will grow on average between two to three months after the procedure , creating the desired thickening effect			0
' @entity7 walks the runway during the @entity80 show at @entity82 - @entity81 but the follically challenged need not despair if their brows are more @entity86 than @entity7 : we have entered the age of the eyebrow extension			1
the process , @entity91 , involves carefully gluing individual synthetic hairs onto existing fine hairs , or directly onto the skin			0
this latest launch from company @entity96 aims to fill in gaps , add volume and extend the brow line			0
eyebrow extensions can attach to existing hairs or onto skin , @entity103 for people with no brows or no hair at all the salon treatment is aimed at those experiencing age - related hair loss or those who have over-plucked or waxed their brows in the past			1
the process gives a texture and realistic look to brows that pencils and pencils and powders ca n't attain , say @entity96			2
the brow extensions are available in different shades and can be glued on to create the type of arch desired			0
' we do eyebrows to suit the age and shape of each individual customer , ' explains @entity128 , owner and director of @entity96			0
' nobody 's brows are the same , ' she says			1
' people find they have natural gaps , or perhaps they over plucked when they were younger			0
' up until now , the only way to bride the gap was to use powder or a pencil , which gives a flat look			0
but now you can have depth and dimension with the eyebrow extensions			0
' the beauty professional recognises fashion 's influence on modern women 's love of big brows			1
' @entity7 has amazing brows and carries them off beautifully			1
she has given women the license to wear their eyebrows boldly and beautifully without needing them trimmed all the time , ' says @entity128			2
' @entity91 is all about bold and beautiful brows			2
fashions do change but gaps in brows will never be in			2
