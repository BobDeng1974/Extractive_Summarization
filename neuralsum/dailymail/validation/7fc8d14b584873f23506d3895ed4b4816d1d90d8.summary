suspended hundreds of feet in the air amid glistening pillars of ice illuminated with ghostly lights from below , this could easily be a computer - generated scene from the latest sci - fi blockbuster movie			2
but in fact these ethereal photographs were taken in real life , and show extreme sportsman and climber @entity9 , 43 , ascending the @entity12 icefall which is part of a gigantic glacier in @entity14 , @entity15			1
the stunning images were captured by fellow mountaineer and photographer @entity18			1
while the 500ft frozen waterfall is regularly scaled by climbers during daylight , he said he wanted to capture the beauty of the falls by night			1
with bright lights illuminating his efforts from below , mr @entity9 appears to be on the set of a sci - fi movie stunning : mr @entity9 ( pictured ) trained as an apprentice carpenter before falling in love with mountaineering during a ski trip as a teenager			1
he gave up woodwork aged 26 , and has earned his living from climbing ever since he said : ' photography and filming at night is a big challenge because of the lighting			0
the ways to play with the factors of light , time and environment fascinate me endlessly			0
' i had considered for a long time how to work with artificial light , which is normally only possible in a photo studio , in major mountains			0
' the transparency and reflective properties of ice in the sun had often caught my eye			0
with its virtually unlimited number of icefalls , @entity15 seemed like the perfect place to put those ideas into practice			0
' climber mr @entity9 was born in @entity68 , @entity69 , near to @entity70 , which is within sight of the northern @entity72			1
while he trained as a carpenter , he fell in love with mountaineering after a skiing trip as a teenager			0
out of this world : mr @entity18 ( pictured bottom right in both images ) was primarily a climber in the early stages of his career , but began to incorporate photography into his adventures , and took these images during one trip in 2012 frozen solid : for a large part of the year the @entity12 icefall is liquid , but during the winter months the bitterly cold air freezes it solid , allowing climbers to attempt to scale it aged 26 he gave up woodwork , became a professional mountain guide , and has made a living from climbing ever since			1
over the course of a near 20 - year career he has racked up hundreds of climbing hours , making first ascents on all seven continents			2
as well as ice climbing , as demonstrated in these photographs , he also specialises in big - wall climbing - scaling sheer rock faces that usually require more than one day to ascend - and bouldering - climbing without the use of safety harnesses or ropes			0
meanwhile photographer mr @entity18 qualified in mechanical engineering , but moved to @entity69 aged 21 to pursue his passion for mountaineering			2
adventurer : mr @entity18 , who took an expedition to the icefall with mr @entity9 in order to photograph it , is pictured left , and right during a climb starting out purely as a climber , he and a group of friends made two first ascents of peaks in the @entity124 , before he began incorporating photography into his adventures			1
he captured these stunning images of mr @entity9 during a trip to @entity15 in 2012			1
he added : ' during the summer months , water tumbles from the cliff tops			0
come winter , this majestic landscape is transformed as the waters are suspended mid-flow creating icefalls			0
' climbers frequently scale them during daylight hours , but we wanted to capture their full beauty and colour at night			2

stunning images captured by photographer @entity18 as climber @entity9 , 43 , scaled frozen waterfall
the @entity12 fall is liquid for most of the year , but in winter freezes into a 500ft cliff *favoured* by climbers
hundreds of adventurers attempt the climb by day , but very few attempt the ascent at night , as pictured here
