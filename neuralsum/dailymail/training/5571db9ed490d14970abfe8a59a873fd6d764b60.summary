researchers found meeting someone face - to - face after looking at their @entity4 photos increases arousal , which the study linked to social anxiety one of the many benefits of @entity4 is that it can connect people from all over the world - but instead of making us more open , it could be making us socially awkward and anxious			1
researchers from @entity15 studied how people reacted to meeting people face - to - face if they had previously interacted with them online			1
they found that during the face - to - face meeting , the participants experienced an increase in arousal , which the researchers linked to an increase in anxiety			1
' the current tendency for people to use @entity4 to ' lurk ' or ' creep ' on other people 's profiles raised the question of what such activities do to change later face - to - face interactions , particularly among the socially anxious , ' explained the researchers			1
to test this theory , researchers from the @entity37 at @entity38 , led by @entity39 , fitted 26 female students with electrodes that measure @entity44 ( @entity44 )			1
these electrodes are used to measure changes in physiological arousal			2
females were explicitly chosen because they are more likely to be @entity4 users , claim the researchers , and they are more likely to experience greater social anxiety			2
all the participants were asked to complete an @entity53 ( @entity54 ) to test their respective levels of social anxiety			2
the students were later divided into four groups and asked to study and memorise the face of another female student in preparation for a facial recognition task			0
in the first group , participants had to study the other person ’s face on a @entity4 profile page.the second group was asked to study the person 's face while she was in the same room			2
this graph shows the different in anxiety levels among participants			0
people who looked at photos on @entity4 before meeting the person face - to - face , rather than vice versa , suffered an increase in anxiety , according to the skin responses			1
this was especially the case with participants who scored highly in a social anxiety test			2

in the third group , participants were first shown the @entity4 photos before meeting the person face - to - face			1
the fourth group carried out the test the other way round , meeting the student face - to - face before being shown photos on @entity4			1
skin conductance levels were measured at several intervals throughout these tests			0

people who looked at photos on @entity4 before meeting the student face - to - face suffered an increase in arousal , according to the skin responses			1
this was especially the case with participants who scored highly in the social anxiety test			0
the researchers claimed this was due to the fact looking at @entity4 photos gave the participant ’s time to compare themselves to the student			2
this can lead to feeling of inferiority , for example			0
‘ this self - presentation and social comparison concerns that would lead to heightened arousal when the stimulus person is present , ’ wrote the study			0
‘ initial @entity4 exposure may not serve a protective function during a subsequent live exposure , but may lead to an increase in negative arousal			0
’ the findings confirm previous studies that found socially anxious people prefer online interactions			0
however , the study also recognised arousal can be associated with positive emotions and it could be possible encountering someone face - to - face after seeing their photos may lead to an increase in positive feelings alternatively , the change from @entity4 to real life may have led to arousal because the socially anxious participants preferred the relative safety of @entity4 and felt agitated when the switch was made			1
the findings confirm previous studies that found socially anxious people prefer online over face - to - face interactions			1
however , the researchers also recognised that physiological arousal can be associated with positive as well as negative emotions			0
they claim it could be possible that encountering someone face - to - face after seeing their photos on @entity4 may lead to an increase in positive rather than negative arousal			1
a previous exposure , for example , may lead to excitement and even a desire to engage when the live encounter occurs			0
they added , however , that they would have expected to see increases in comfort and relief if this was the case and claimed more research needs to be carried out			0

researchers studied how online interaction *affects* face - to - face meetings
they fitted 26 students with electrodes to measure physiological arousal
students were shown @entity4 photos of a subject before meeting them
during face - to - face meetings , participants suffered an increase in arousal
researchers linked this arousal to an increase in social anxiety
they believe viewing photos leads people to rate themselves against that person , and this can increase anxiety
