by @entity0 for those who savour the spectacle of a manager at bay , @entity1 is providing splendid sport			1
the poor fellow is being scrutinised with sadistic relish			1
are those stress lines on his brow ? does he seem a touch haggard ? has he lost the trust of his players ? is he crumpling under the pressure ? might he be considering something drastic ; resignation , perhaps ? the possibilities are endless			1
this past fortnight has not been kind to @entity23 clubs in the @entity24			2
@entity25 were gently passed to pieces by @entity27			2
what next ? @entity29 players look dejected as @entity30 go 2 - 0 up in @entity31 in midweek where 's the passion ? @entity1 has had his fair share of criticism , but the players deserve there 's too @entity38 , more creditably , were beaten by the reigning champions @entity39 , while @entity40 at least managed a goal in their insipid draw with @entity43			1
but it was @entity29 who commanded most of the shock – horror notices by losing to @entity30			1
while the other results were merely disappointing , @entity29 ’s first - leg performance carried darker overtones			1
this was a defeat which seemed to crystalise all the doubts and suspicions which now surround @entity29			1
for this looked horribly like an exercise in shoulder - shrugging indifference			2
it was the kind of performance that demeaned a major @entity61 club			2
and worse , it damaged the reputation of ‘ the best league in the world ’			2
despite all the evidence to the contrary , that banal title is so often bestowed that it is rarely questioned			2
its supporters insist that no other league can offer such pace , such physical strength , such unstinting , often misguided , effort			2
and then there is the money ; uncounted and uncountable , blissfully bubbling from a tap which is never turned off			2
everything about the @entity78 reeks of extreme wealth , from the gargantuan television contracts to the munificent patronage of sheik and oligarch , the stunning transfer fees , the steepling salaries , the insatiable taste for tacky excess			2
sure , it can not produce the equal of a @entity39 , a @entity27 or a @entity89 , neither can it produce enough capable @entity23 players to mount a credible @entity92 challenge , but no matter			2
the @entity78 makes a lot of ordinary players insanely rich , and it yields a winter ’s worth of @entity97			2
the best in the world ? no contest			2
such is the delusion , one which @entity102 dismissed in a few contemptuous phrases the other evening			2
@entity102 described the notion as ‘ nonsense ’			0
invisible : @entity107 put in an absent performance in @entity109 on tuesday night he said we had been ‘ brainwashed ’ , that it was not ‘ the best league ’ but merely ‘ the best brand ’			0
in other words , the marketing is superb while the football is all too frequently second rate			0
and reality kicks in when our clubs approach the sharp end of a @entity61 campaign			0
which brings us back to the manager of @entity29			1
@entity1 has been in the job for less than a season and he has undoubtedly been disturbed by the discovery that the team he inherited are woefully unfit for purpose			1
@entity130 ’s attempts to influence midfield affairs are as fruitless with @entity29 as they are with @entity132			1
@entity133 is no longer of relevance and as for the likes of @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 , the least said the better			1
off colour : @entity130 was hotly - tipped not so long ago , but has been disappointing overall helpless : @entity30 ' @entity140 skips past @entity133 as the @entity142 looks on @entity143 was anxious to avoid any shadow of blame for his team ’s plight : ‘ my fellow players are sometimes occupying the spaces i want to play in , and when i see that it makes it difficult , ’ he explained			1
then , having missed from 10 yards against @entity30 , he reflected that it was : ‘ a shame because i do n’t get a lot of chances			0
’ @entity156 is reported to be ‘ considering his future ’ in the summer			0
while he is at it , he might give some thought to his recent past			0
clueless : united players look frustrated as @entity163 runs away in celebration at the first goal down and out ? @entity1 slumps back into his seat after @entity30 score their second goal yet we doubt that there will be any serious self - examination from any of these people			1
indeed , @entity172 seemed mildly miffed when it was suggested that @entity29 ’s players might have brought their troubles upon themselves			1
@entity172 , you see , is a famous footballer and just 10 months ago he and his chums won the championship of the best league in the world			0
as such , they are immune from criticism			0
no , if anybody deserves censure for @entity29 ’s abysmal season , then we must turn to the usual suspect , to the man whose ongoing agonies are public property			1
of course @entity1 has made his share of mistakes			1
his pragmatic strategies have often seemed at odds with @entity29 ’s cavalier tradition , his bearing has sometimes appeared dourly disgruntled , while his transfer dealings have been uninspired			1
@entity198 ? @entity172 is usually @entity29 's go - to man , but was poor on tuesday night at @entity30 outstretched : @entity200 is well beaten by @entity202 's shot in the 55th minute to deflate @entity29 flat out : @entity143 lies on the floor after missing @entity29 's best chance of the game late on yet he is a talented , driven man who has taken on a massive task			1
if he is to succeed , he will have to spend vast sums of money and shed a cargo of footballers			0
and he will do so in the knowledge that little or no public blame will be attributed to those under - performing young men , nor to their successors			0
if it should all go wrong then he , the manager , will carry the can			0
such is the nature of the job and @entity1 understood that when he signed his handsome contract			1
he neither seeks nor deserves our sympathy but , as the headlines grow harsher and the @entity223 prattle their doltish abuse , he is entitled to a degree of intelligent understanding			0
it is not a lot to ask , from the best league in the world			0
@entity231 ’s first six months as @entity233 chairman have not been an unqualified success			1
from his opening battle cry — ‘ i do n’t think anyone realistically thinks we are going to win the @entity92 in @entity240 ’ — to his fatuous cut - throat gesture at the announcement of @entity132 ’s @entity92 draw , to his ham - fisted attempts to recruit a so - called ‘ @entity247 ’ , @entity231 has proceeded with the measured tread of a drunk on roller skates			1
but his latest mishap is far more serious			0
not present : @entity231 was presiding over an @entity233 board meeting in @entity250 while @entity252 's funeral was taking place on thursday , when the @entity23 game was gathering in @entity255 to bury one of the noblest , most sublimely gifted men it has ever produced , @entity231 was presiding over an @entity233 board meeting , 218 miles away in @entity250			1
now , it is possible that @entity231 does not understand how much sir @entity252 meant to @entity23 football , nor how rich was his contribution to the nation ’s game			1
if so , then somebody , somewhere should have had the wit to brief him			0
because the chairman of the @entity233 should not have been swapping platitudes with a bunch of blazers			1
he should have been seated in @entity270 to honour sir @entity130			1
it was more than a matter of priorities ; it was a question of duty			0
lining the streets : the hearse carrying sir @entity252 passes @entity255 's @entity278 ground carried in : @entity252 's coffin arrives for his funeral at @entity281 , carried by former @entity283 players @entity284 ( left ) and @entity285 ( centre ) and current star @entity287 @entity289 ’s attempts to endear himself to @entity291 followers have taken another fascinating turn			1
his earlier efforts included firing the successful manager , @entity294 , and changing the club ’s colours from the traditional blue to a ‘ lucky ’ red			0
now , with his club in the bottom three of the @entity78 , the owner has warned supporters not to take him for granted			0
‘ right now , i will stay , ’ he said			0
‘ unless the fans p * * * me off so much , then i may leave			0
’ clearly , the old charmer sees this as an ominous threat			0
he may well be mistaken			0
on the attack : @entity289 launched a tirade against former manager @entity294 ' @entity310 ' : @entity289 said @entity294 only got the club promoted because he went ' beserk ' with the owner 's cash a week ago , in an item on @entity317 , i mentioned two of their former players , @entity318 and @entity321			1
@entity318 was described as a ‘ great ’ player , chamberlain as ‘ a blissfully under - talented winger ’			0
i was attempting to convey my belief that , by comparison with the brilliant @entity318 , everyone who played for @entity317 in that era was ‘ blissfully under - talented ’			0
as many @entity317 fans have pointed out , it was a poor choice of words which was quite unfair to a fine footballer and a much - loved character			0
i have apologised to @entity321 and accepted his affectionate , and very ‘ @entity334 ’ , reprimand			0
famous faces : @entity317 old boys @entity318 ( left ) , @entity321 ( right )			0

@entity1 has inherited a team that is woefully unfit for purpose
the boss has made his fair share of mistakes too , with his pragmatic strategies at odds with @entity29 's tradition
but @entity130 , @entity133 , @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 have *underperformed* , among others
@entity231 should have been at sir @entity252 's funeral , not presiding over an @entity233 board meeting with a bunch of blazers in @entity250
