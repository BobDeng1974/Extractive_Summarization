@entity0 has left the @entity1 in @entity2 following a five - hour hearing on the first day of his appeal case against his four - month ban for biting @entity6 at the @entity7			1
@entity0 refused to answer questions as he left the @entity1 headquarters in the @entity11 city but did stop to sign autographs for waiting fans			2
the @entity15 striker and his legal team are confident the ban from ' all football - related activity ' , handed down by world governing body @entity19 , will be halved			1
this would open the way for @entity22 star @entity0 , 27 , to return after august 25 , potentially making his debut for the @entity25 club at @entity26 on august 31			1
following the hearing , @entity1 issued a statement which read : ' @entity64 ( @entity1 ) has today heard the appeal of @entity0 , @entity15 and the @entity67 @entity66 against @entity19			1
the hearing took place at the @entity1 headquarters in @entity2 , @entity11			2
' the player was present and gave a statement to the @entity1 arbitrators : mr @entity74 , @entity11 ( president ) , professor @entity76 , @entity77 , and dr @entity78 , @entity11			2
' at the end of the hearing , the panel informed the parties that it will issue its decision as soon as possible , probably before the end of next week			0
' the full arbitral award , with the grounds , will follow at a later date and be published by the @entity1			0
' @entity19 imposed the four - month ban from all football , plus a nine - month international ban and a £ 66,000 fine , after the former @entity92 player bit @entity6 on the shoulder during @entity22 's 1 - 0 win on june 24			1
the governing body 's appeal committee have already turned down an appeal against the suspension			0
mobbed : @entity0 is surrounded by photographers and cameramen as he arrives at @entity1 headquarters encouragement : a young @entity15 fan wishes @entity0 well and hopes to see him playing for his side soon waiting game : the press wait for @entity0 to re-emerge from @entity1 after a decision is made what he did @entity0 bit @entity77 defender @entity6 on the shoulder while waiting for a cross during @entity22 's @entity7 match on june 24			1
replays showed @entity0 lunged at @entity6 and bit him before falling to the ground clutching his face			2
the @entity115 later pulled down his shirt to reveal bite marks			0
the punishment on june 26 , @entity19 's @entity119 handed down a four - month ban from all football - related activity as well as a nine - match international suspension and a fine of £ 66,000			1
what are the implications of this ? the four - month ban means @entity0 is unable to play again until october 25			1
after the @entity7 , @entity92 sold him to @entity15 for a fee of £ 75m			2
intriguingly , if the ban is upheld , @entity0 's first match after the ban will be the @entity132 with @entity133 on october 26			2
what if the appeal succeeds ? his legal team believe there is a chance the ban could be halved to just two months , therefore expiring on august 25 instead			1
@entity15 's first match after that date is at @entity26 on august 31			1
incident : @entity0 bit @entity77 defender @entity6 on the shoulder during @entity22 's 1 - 0 win at the @entity7 marked : @entity6 shows the bite marks after @entity0 sunk his teeth into his shoulder but @entity148 , the world players ' union , supports a reduction in @entity0 's punishment at domestic and international level			1
a statement on the organisation 's website read : ' that @entity0 has been trialled and vilified in public , ever since the incident , is a sanction in itself			2
' on the other hand , it has been remarkable to see the response from his fellow professionals and the victim himself , @entity6			0
' many agree the sanctions are excessive			0
this is an important signal for the @entity1 panel to consider			0
' the sanctions are a disproportionate response to the offence			0
' especially the four - month ban from all football - related activity , which is unfair for @entity0 as it infringes his right to work at club level			1
' in the international arena , where the offence was committed , a nine - match ban for @entity22 is also too strong as it effectively equates to a two - year sanction			1
plea of innocence : @entity0 then collapsed to the ground holding his front teeth new signing : @entity92 sold @entity0 to @entity15 for £ 75m after his ban was handed down bearing his teeth : @entity0 later apologised to @entity6 and the ' entire football family ' and promised that there would never again be another incident video if appeal unsuccessful , @entity0 will return for @entity132 ' @entity148 states the educative nature of the sanction mentioned by @entity19 in the ruling can be much better achieved by making it partially conditional , including the obligation for @entity0 to receive treatment			1
' this can be applied on the number of matches but also on the period of the ban			0
the @entity19 appeals committee missed an opportunity to take this into account			0
@entity148 expects that @entity1 will respect these assumptions			0
' @entity0 's lawyer @entity205 , a member of the @entity67 @entity66 's executive , admitted there was little chance of overturning the nine - match international ban , but there was a likelihood of getting the four - month overall ban reduced			1
@entity205 told @entity215 newspaper @entity214 : ' it would be more logical to reduce the sanction by a few months than to reduce the ban concerning international games , because legally it 's easier to contend against the terms of the suspension that forbid him from training and from being at the club , because they violate fundamental rights			0
' the other ban ( the nine - match ban for @entity22 ) is more a question of the level of the punishment			2
' @entity92 sold @entity0 , who scored 31 goals last season , to @entity15 for £ 75m after his @entity19 ban			1
the @entity1 , based in @entity2 , @entity11 , is regarded as the ' @entity233 ' for the sporting world			0
since its establishment by the @entity236 ( @entity236 ) in 1984 , it has resolved thousands of disputes that were unable to be settled by the sport 's own governing body			0
the @entity1 has often been used to settle doping cases but also sponsorship disputes and even the result of competitions			0
