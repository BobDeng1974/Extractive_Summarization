@entity0 became the 12th player to take 300 one - day international wickets as @entity3 eased to a six - wicket victory against @entity5			1
the 36 - year - old , who took an impressive 4 - 18 , is the first @entity7 to pass the landmark and now sits in the esteemed company of greats such as @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13			1
@entity5 required a seventh - wicket partnership of 86 between @entity15 and @entity16 to post a respectable 186 all out , having chosen to bat , but a 19 - ball 42 from @entity19 ensured there would be no shock in @entity22			1
@entity0 became the 12th player to take 300 one - day international wickets @entity0 of @entity3 celebrates taking the wicket of @entity25 of @entity5 at the @entity26 @entity0 celebrates with @entity19 after taking the wicket of @entity25 during the @entity26 match perhaps a mark of the man and an added insight into the where the focus of the team remains , @entity0 said the landmark was something he would think about after the @entity26			1
' right now we are caught up in the middle of a @entity26 , ' he said			0
' we have an important game on friday ( group game against @entity40 ) , and then probably the most important of our careers the following saturday ( quarter - final )			0
' maybe in a month , it will be the time to look back on it			0
i did n't go into the @entity26 thinking about that milestone , i did n't believe i would take this many wickets in this few games			0
' understandably stung from being smashed for a record - breaking 417 runs by @entity50 in @entity51 days earlier , @entity48 chose to bat after calling correctly at the toss			0
@entity5 were made to pay for a choice that signaled a slight naivety within the camp , with their own coaching staff having previously admitted that bowling was the side 's strong suit			2
the newcomers to the @entity26 stage collapsed to 34 - 3 and then 59 - 6 , as @entity0 caused most of the damage after @entity64 had @entity65 trapped lbw for just one			1
@entity19 has developed into an imposing captain , known for his ingenuity and outrageously attacking fields – so his decision to bowl his spinner in just the third over was met with mild surprise			0
the decision was less genius and more to allow @entity3 's opening bowlers , @entity76 and @entity77 , to switch ends			2
the 36 - year - old is the first @entity7 to pass the landmark of 300 odi wickets @entity3 eased to a six - wicket win over @entity5 at the @entity26 on sunday he now sits in the company of greats such as @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 @entity0 of @entity3 speaks at a post-match press conference following their @entity26 win still , @entity0 showed that he 's as accurate in the third over as in the 15th as he struck with his first ball			1
@entity90 lost sight of the ball and saw his off stump disturbed			0
with his opening strike bowlers having switched ends , @entity19 resumed the pace attack , and @entity97 could only send a short ball from @entity77 into the geelful clutches of @entity100			0
@entity76 , struggling with his line and length , was replaced by @entity0 , who took @entity103 by bowling @entity104 for 27 with the first ball of his third over			2
the @entity108 - born spinner was on a roll and had @entity48 ( 6 ) and @entity25 dismissed off consecutive balls			0
@entity48 was caught at slip , while @entity25 was trapped leg before			0
that brought @entity15 to the crease for the hat - trick ball , and the batsman was welcomed by the sight of nine men around his bat , with no fielder outside the circle			0
however , he survived and showed maturity beyond his years in his partnership with @entity16 before departing after a run - a - ball 56 that ended when he top - edged a short and wide bouncer from @entity128 to @entity0 at third man			1
@entity3 's @entity130 gets a handshake from @entity5 's @entity132 ( left ) after the match @entity3 are very much on course to end their @entity26 victory drought @entity16 , undoubtedly @entity5 's best batsman in this tournament , was the anchor of his side 's innings , and he made 54 off 110 balls before falling to @entity139			1
an entertaining cameo from @entity132 ( 16 off 21 ) took @entity5 to 186 , but for the fifth consecutive @entity26 match @entity3 bowled out their opposition			1
the number of orange target t - shirts seemed to double after the resumption of play with the crowd undoubtedly expecting @entity19 to send a few balls into the stand and help them earn a share of the pot of money for the ' one - handed crowd catch ' promotion			2
but @entity19 cleared the rope just once in his innings before being bowled by @entity48 with one that kept a touch low			0
his departure unsurprisingly slowed the run chase , and when @entity162 picked out midwicket off @entity164 for 33 , the @entity5 believed they had a chance			2
two comical run - outs saw @entity100 ( 57 ) and @entity167 ( 19 ) further add to the nerves of the @entity170 crowd , but @entity130 , the birthday boy , held his nerve to steer @entity3 home			1
the same side , the same outcome , the same feeling after the match – @entity3 are very much on course to end their @entity26 victory drought .			1

@entity0 became just the 12th player to take 300 odi wickets
the 36 - year - old is the first @entity7 to pass the landmark
he took 4 - 18 to earn his place among greats such as @entity11
@entity3 eased to a six - wicket victory over @entity5 in @entity22
