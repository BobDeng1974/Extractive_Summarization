@entity1 's slow start to the @entity3 season was due to poor preparation , according to full back @entity5			1
the @entity8 full back , who has once again been a crucial part of @entity1 's defence this season , blamed the champions ' disappointing early - season form on a lack of fitness in the club 's squad			2
but @entity5 insisted that @entity1 , who are on an eight - game winning run in the league , are now back to their best as they hunt down @entity23			1
@entity5 celebrates with @entity24 after helping @entity1 extend their winning run @entity5 claims his team - mates were under - prepared at the start of the season , but are now ready to shine ' from the beginning of the season some of the players were not physically 100 per cent , ' said @entity5			1
' but now we look so much better			0
' it was hard becasue we probably did n't have enough rest and it was n't a very long pre-season , ' added the @entity8 , who played in last summer 's @entity38 final			2
' now i think everyone has improved			0
that 's why we have got better as a team - and we have to keep playing at this level			0
' in the way we want to play , we were lacking some intensity and concentration			0
it cost us a few points			2
' @entity5 hailed @entity1 's team spirit after making it eight wins in a row against @entity53 @entity24 ( right ) opened the scoring with a deflected shot during @entity1 's 3 - 0 defeat of @entity53 however , going into the busy @entity59 period @entity1 , who were once nine points behind leaders @entity23 , are now just three points off top spot			1
city travel to @entity63 on @entity64 hoping to keep the pressure up on the @entity3 's top side			1
and @entity67 believes @entity69 's team are bound to drop points during the festive fixtures			0
the likes of @entity73 made slow starts to the @entity1 title defence , but have started to show their best form ' even if @entity23 are winning games and looking solid , it is normal to have a point of the season where you can lose points			1
' it will be very hard to play on the 26th and 28th within 48 hours of one another			0
