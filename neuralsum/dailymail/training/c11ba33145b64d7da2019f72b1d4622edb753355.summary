by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @entity2 @entity3 became @entity5 ’s club - record signing when he joined for £ 9.5million on deadline day			1
the @entity8 striker penned a three - year deal at the @entity10 but his arrival was somewhat overshadowed by the subsequent scramble to sign @entity14 ’s @entity13			1
so who is @entity3 ? and what will he bring to the @entity17 ? @entity18 tells you more … new arrival : @entity3 completed a £ 9.5m club - record move to @entity5 from @entity23 on deadline day first things first , what are the basics ? well , he only turned 24 last month so his best years should still be ahead of him			1
born in @entity28 on the country ’s coast , he made his debut at 16 with @entity32 in the second tier			0
a transfer to current @entity36 champions @entity35 soon followed and he did n’t hang around there for too long either , moving to @entity38 and @entity23 when still only 18			2
he spent his early months in the youth - team ranks but come the age of 19 he was a regular in the first - team set - up			0
indeed , his first full season produced seven league goals from 21 appearances			0
but his strike - rate dropped and , over the next three seasons , he managed only 10 from 56 outings			0
he contributed only one goal as @entity23 were relegated in 2013			0
last season , however , undoubtedly won him his move to the @entity40 , 14 league goals meaning he signed off with a one - in - two ratio as the @entity63 returned to @entity38 as champions			2
promise : @entity3 has been billed as the next big thing for years but he is yet to fully fulfil his potential but that was @entity71 , is that not a concern ? perhaps , but the season in a lower league appears to have given him the platform to rediscover his form and fitness and at least he arrives full of confidence			1
decent record : @entity3 netted 14 times for @entity23 as they were promoted from @entity71 last season what about at international level ? he ’s competing with former @entity23 team - mate @entity83 and @entity84 for a starting berth , and as a result he was restricted to just 39 minutes at the @entity87			1
but he has 14 caps and seven goals – four of which came in an 8 - 0 win over @entity92 – and in the absence of @entity84 he could be set for a run in the national side			2
prolific : @entity3 's record at international level is impressive , having netted seven times in 14 appearances so what type of player is he ? he ’s 6ft1ins but @entity3 is more pace than power			1
if @entity106 is the targetman at @entity5 , then the new boy will buzz around him , populating the flanks when given license			0
manager @entity109 has already labelled him an ‘ exciting talent ’ who ‘ supporters will enjoy watching ’			0
@entity3 is nicknamed ‘ @entity113 ’ , and @entity109 will certainly be hoping he ’s struck gold			0
quick : @entity3 is more about pace than power and can thrive alongside @entity118 up front for @entity5 will he be a success with @entity5 then ? you ’d argue they have upgraded on @entity123 and saved themselves £ 2m in the process			1
he needs to improve his potency in front of goal but his pace will also create chances for others			0
but , at 24 , time is on his side and we think @entity5 have made a smart investment			2
good deal ? @entity5 have sold @entity123 to @entity137 , signed @entity3 and saved £ 2m in the process			1

@entity3 became @entity5 's club record signing on deadline day
@entity144 striker moved to club from @entity23 for £ 9.5million
@entity3 has an impressive seven goals for @entity8 in 14 appearances
the 24 - year - old scored 14 goals as @entity23 were promoted from @entity71
has pace but yet to fulfil his potential so will hope to thrive at @entity10
