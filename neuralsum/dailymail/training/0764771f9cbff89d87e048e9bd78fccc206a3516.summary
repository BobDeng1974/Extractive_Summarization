by @entity0 climate change is threatening @entity3 landmarks from the @entity4 in @entity5 to the launchpads at @entity8 's @entity7 in @entity9			1
a new study has revealed the full extent of the crisis facing @entity14 's most cherised landmarks - and says almost two dozen are at risk			1
they include @entity19 's historic districts , the @entity20 in @entity21 and an array of @entity8 sites including the @entity7 in @entity24 , @entity9			1
the new report says the @entity4 in @entity5 ( left ) to the launchpads at @entity8 's @entity7 ( right ) are at risk , also named were the @entity27 ( top middle ) , the oldest masonry fort in @entity14 and parts of @entity19 landmarks at risk include the @entity4 and @entity33 in @entity5 , which was the entry point for 14 million immigrants from 1886 to 1924			1
sea level has risen 12 inches ( 30 centimeters ) around @entity38 over the past century , the report said			0
then came @entity39 in 2012 , which flooded most of @entity41 and all of @entity33 , destroying most of their infrastructure and forcing their closure for months			0
@entity5 is now rebuilding electrical systems on the islands ' as much as 20 feet above sea level and designing the heating and air conditioning systems to withstand flooding , ' the report said			0
other sites at risk include the first permanent @entity56 colony in @entity14 at @entity57 in @entity58 , and historic @entity59 , @entity60			1
another is @entity62 , where the first african slaves arrived in 1619 and where 250 years later they were given refuge as ' contraband ' of the @entity66 , a move that paved the way for the abolition of slavery			0
also under threat are the @entity73 in @entity74 , @entity75 with floods , rising sea levels and fires , scientists said on tuesday			0
@entity79 at @entity80 , a report published by the @entity83 - based @entity82 , highlighted more than two dozen sites that potentially face serious natural disasters			1
' the imminent risks to these sites and the artifacts they contain threaten to pull apart the quilt that tells the story of the nation 's heritage and history , ' @entity86 , director of climate impacts at the union , a non-profit organization for science advocacy in @entity83 and the study 's co-author , said in a statement			1
the report is not slated for publication in a scientific journal , said @entity106 , senior climate scientist who co-authored the report			0
it said that reducing carbon emissions could minimize the predicted risks posed by climate change			0
' we must prepare our cherished landmarks for these worsening climate impacts and take steps to make climate resilience a national priority , ' the scientists wrote			2
where could be affected ? ' at the same time , we must work to minimize these risks in the future by reducing the carbon emissions that are causing climate change and its accompanying impacts			0
' the report highlights 30 at - risk locations chosen because the science behind the risks they face is robust , and because together they shine a spotlight on the different kinds of climate impacts already affecting the @entity3 ' cultural heritage , the team said			1
at some sites - such as @entity137 and @entity138 and @entity140 - steps have already been taken to prepare for these growing climate risks			1
at many other sites , such efforts have not yet begun			2
' as these case studies illustrate , climate change is no longer a distant threat for others to worry about , ' the team said			0
' the consequences are already underway , with serious and growing risks to the places and communities we care about			0

' if future generations of @entity3 are to experience the joy and wonder that these extraordinary places engender , we must act now to protect them from the impacts of climate change today and prepare them for expected additional changes tomorrow			0
' we must also take steps to minimize the risks of climate change in the future by taking immediate action to reduce the carbon emissions that are driving up the planet 's temperature			2
' the historic legacy of the @entity3 is at stake			2
' drastic change : the @entity215 in @entity83 one day may only be accessible by boat @entity192 , @entity58 - the first permanent @entity217 colony - could be completely inundated due to rising sea levels , and the nearby @entity62 , ' will become an island unto itself within 70 years , ' @entity86 said			2
in the western @entity3 , rising temperatures have led to an increase in wildfires by melting winter snowpacks earlier , leaving forests drier for longer , the report said			0
among @entity75 's 20 largest fires since 1932 , a dozen have happened since 2002 , the report said			1
an unrelated report published on monday showed that the @entity75 drought has cost thousands of jobs and $ 1.7 billion to farmers in the state 's @entity233			2
governor @entity235 has partly blamed climate change for the drought			0
earlier this months scientists warned that vast glaciers in @entity239 are locked in an irreversible thaw linked to global warming – and created incredible images show the effect the melt would have on some of the @entity3 ’s classic coastal city areas			0
experts say the melt could add 12 feet ( 1.2 to 3.7 meters ) to current sea levels in a few hundred years and the images illustrate the impact this increase would have on cities including @entity253 , @entity19 and @entity254			1
the photographs were developed by @entity257 - based digital artist @entity256 , based on sea level - rise mapping data from @entity260			2
watery @entity19 : this image shows what the city 's @entity262 would look like if sea levels rose by 12 feet , with roads leading to the bay completely submerged soggy playing conditions : @entity269 in @entity254 would need to become a water polo venue , according to @entity256 's digital imaging flooded : the @entity272 would be completely unusable if sea levels rose by 12 feet , with water almost encroaching onto the road next to it @entity277 : @entity279 ' famous coastal hot - spot might only be navigable by canoe in the future , with the beach totally submerged by the waters of the @entity284 road to nowhere : @entity253 's @entity285 is a popular spot for a stroll and a cruise , but in a few hundred years it might be better suited to fishing expeditions in the shocking pictures the @entity215 in @entity83 is surrounded by water , @entity285 in @entity253 looks like it would only be navigable by boat and @entity294 in @entity254 is mostly under water			1
and you 'd need waders to walk around the @entity272 , according to the predictions			0
a @entity8 study looking at 40 years of ground , airplane and satellite data shows the melt is happening faster than scientists had predicted , crossing a critical threshold that has begun a domino - like process			1
some scientists believe that a build - up of man - made greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is affecting wind patterns around @entity239 , driving warmer waters towards the continent			2
@entity315 , from the @entity316 at @entity317 , said : ' although such extreme sea level rise is only likely to occur after several centuries of global warming , these startling images should help @entity3 politicians and the public to understand the scale of the risks created by climate change			0
' alarming : the @entity327 will need more than a few sandbags in the future to keep the water out , if @entity260 is correct @entity254 's @entity294 may one day be completely submerged how @entity254 's @entity294 might one day look from above water sight : @entity333 campus would make for a nice boating lake in the future , apparently soaked : the lush lawn in front of the @entity338 may be lost forever sea - ing is believing : @entity272 's @entity340 may one day be claimed by the ocean			1
