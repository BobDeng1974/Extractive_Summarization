or a timely reminder that , however wildly the oldco / newco debate may still rage in certain quarters , some things never change			0
when these two teams meet , there is invariably only one winner			0
@entity9 chairman @entity8 weighed into the fray at the weekend with his assertion that @entity12 are a ‘ new entity ’			1
on tuesday night at @entity14 , his boys found their opponents just as difficult to beat as any @entity12 side in history ; their wait for a first victory over the @entity21 outfit since april 1930 goes on			1
an early strike by @entity23 , a @entity25 own goal and a late finish by sub @entity27 were enough to take @entity29 ’s team another three points closer to the @entity31 , as they navigated another potentially tricky encounter on a cold night in @entity9 , where men are men — and even the bravest are happy to wear crash helmets			1
there ’s no place quite like it on @entity39			0
@entity27 celebrates scoring the final goal in @entity12 3 - 0 defeat of @entity9 @entity29 's side have moved up to four points behind @entity44 in the @entity46 table the tyre marks on the infield provided a visible reminder , if the well - worn track and the safety fences were n’t enough , of the fact that @entity14 is arguably much more famous for stock - car racing than football ; this might have been one of the few nights when the beautiful game attracted as many as the meat - and - potatoes motorsport action			1
@entity12 were the reason for the bigger than usual crowd , of course			2
if the home punters turned up hoping to see the visitors skid and slide to disaster , the majority flocked to the stadium purely to laud the team expected — still — to win the @entity46 title			2
@entity29 ’s men started the night seven points behind leaders @entity44 , albeit with a game in hand , and here was the perfect opportunity to close that gap and apply some pressure to the @entity79 boys			1
@entity9 were joint - bottom of the table , level on points with @entity84 , and had been conceding at a rate of over two - and - a - half goals per game			1
an open goal for @entity12 , if ever there was , to take one more small step on the journey back to the elite division			2
if that sounds like a stop - gap sort of ambition , supporters have become well accustomed to this new reality by now			0
@entity23 opened the scoring at a venue usually reserved for stock car racing law celebrates his opening goal that kept up @entity12 ' long tradition of winning at @entity9 never mind the fact that this game was taking place 22 years exactly after the @entity108 glories at @entity109			1
the fact that they were still playing in @entity113 ’s premier club competition five years ago to the night , against @entity114 , is neither here nor there			0
@entity12 were here to win and , with @entity44 setting such a brisk pace , any hint of a slip - up would have been reason for concern			1
they needed a quick start			0
that very thing was provided with just minutes on the clock , as the pairing of @entity23 and @entity127 exchanged passes to cut a broad swathe through the inside right channel , the @entity12 midfielder beating goalkeeper @entity132 with a sharp , low finish across goal			2
behind before they had even really got themselves into the game , @entity9 might have crumbled			0
instead , they seemed to discover a swagger belying both the situation and their status			0
from former @entity145 kid @entity143 playing his way out of defence , to the force of nature that is on - loan @entity152 striker @entity151 , the @entity9 actually looked a more than decent side			2
@entity154 forward @entity151 caused @entity155 all sorts of problems , the @entity158 dropping off his marker to pick up the ball and then , invariably , running at him with intent , displaying enough pace to make him dangerous — and more than a few tricks			0
@entity9 's @entity25 hangs his head after deflecting in an own goal for @entity12 ' second @entity12 teammates congratulate @entity127 after his cross was deflected in to make it 2 - 0 with 16 minutes gone , @entity151 left @entity155 for dead on the left , skipped along the bye - line and drilled in a low cross that required a brilliant @entity174 clearance under pressure from @entity176			1
if @entity12 always looked to have the better overall quality in attack , with on - loan @entity181 defender @entity178 forced into a great saving block on @entity183 and @entity143 required to make a similarly important intervention on @entity174 , they also had to defend			2
new @entity187 call - up @entity185 was booked for two ill - timed lunges in the space of minutes , with @entity12 also riding their luck at times			2
this was never more true than just after the half - hour mark , as @entity193 showed a bit of nous on the edge of the box to put @entity176 in one - on - one , the striker ’s left - footed shot scudding past @entity200 — but bouncing off the keeper ’s left post			0
@entity12 came close to making it 2 - 0 just a minute into the second half , a @entity174 corner from the left cleared only as far as @entity207 , whose thumping low drive beat @entity209 but not the vigilant figure of @entity211 , in position at the far post to make a goal - line clearance			1
@entity12 ' @entity185 ( @entity215 ) , who received a @entity187 call - up , is challenged by @entity9 's @entity217 @entity27 completes the routine victory with a late finish from @entity221 's pass the crucial second came from a brilliant finish by ‘ @entity224 ’			1
just not the ‘ @entity224 ’ @entity12 fans might have expected			0
@entity127 ’s deep cross from the right was looking for his strike partner — but the defender got there well ahead of him , his header flying in off the underside of the bar for a truly spectacular own goal			0
the right - back very nearly made amends for his howler within seconds , forcing @entity200 into a full - stretch save with an absolute belter of a free - kick from nearly 30 yards out			0
but , by now , this game was heading in one direction , as @entity12 eased clear of a tiring home side , @entity27 making it 3 - 0 with six minutes remaining as he finished from a neat @entity221 pass .			1

@entity12 moved four points behind @entity44 in the @entity46
@entity9 have not beaten the @entity21 side since april 1930
goals from @entity252 , @entity27 and an own goal from @entity25 completed a 3 - 0 victory for @entity29 's side
