by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 03:31 est , 23 october 2013 updated : 07:12 est , 23 october 2013 warning : prime minister @entity2 said @entity3 had to prove it was protecting children @entity2 today challenged @entity3 to prove that its system protected children after the site was forced to reinstate a ban on beheading videos			1
the prime minister led criticism against the social networking site after it lifted a ban on users posting graphic videos of violent killings			2
the firm yesterday bowed to pressure from child internet protection campaigners by taking down a graphic video of a woman being beheaded in @entity19			1
@entity3 ’s unpublicised change in policy came to light after it refused to remove a 57 - second video showing a young @entity19 woman , her hands tied behind her back and on her knees , being beheaded by a masked man in broad daylight			1
it was posted last week under the title ‘ @entity31 can watch this video ? ’			2
mr @entity2 yesterday condemned @entity3 's ' irresponsible ' actions and demanded the firm ' explain their actions to worried parents			1
’ after the video was removed , the prime minister today welcomed the change of heart but warned youngsters using the site needed to be protected			2
mr @entity2 wrote on @entity42 : ‘ i 'm pleased @entity3 has changed its approach on beheading videos			1
the test is now to ensure their policy is robust in protecting children			0
' @entity3 had said that while the images must not be posted for ‘ sadistic pleasure ’ , they should be available for those who wish to condemn them			1
however , last night it was revealed @entity3 had removed the clip of a woman being beheaded and said it would use a broader set of criteria to determine when gory videos are permitted on the site			1
challenge : the prime minister used rival social media site @entity42 to keep up pressure on @entity3 alert : @entity3 has begun adding warning messages to videos on its website showing decapitations the website had earlier begun adding alerts to videos showing decapitations or other extreme violence , saying : ' warning ! this video contains extremely graphic content and may be upsetting '			1
‘ when we review content that is reported to us , we will take a more holistic look at the context surrounding a violent image or video , ’ a @entity3 spokesman said			1
‘ second , we will consider whether the person posting the content is sharing it responsibly , such as accompanying the video or image with a warning and sharing it with an age - appropriate audience			0
’ terrible : the filmed executions of people like @entity95 would have been allowed to be shown on @entity3 after they quietly lifted a ban - now reintroduced the change underscores a challenge for @entity3 as it seeks to position itself as the go - to online destination where people share up - to - the - minute images and discuss breaking news events			1
the @entity103 firm acknowledged last night that its previous approach , which permitted the video of the woman 's killing in @entity19 to remain on its site , was flawed			1
‘ based on these enhanced standards , we have re-examined recent reports of graphic content and have concluded that this content improperly and irresponsibly glorifies violence			0
for this reason , we have removed it , ’ the company said			0
suicide prevention charities had denounced the original move to lift the ban on beheading videos , warning that the clips were ‘ psychologically destructive ’ to teenagers			2
others accused @entity3 of double standards for allowing footage of beheadings but restricting what breastfeeding mothers can post and demanding women remove pictures of their mastectomy scars			2
after the video of the @entity134 woman being beheaded was posted , @entity3 users reacted with outrage			1
one disgusted viewer commented : ‘ remove this video , too many young innocent minds out there should n’t see this			0
’ another wrote : ‘ this is absolutely horrible , distasteful and needs to be removed ... i ’m very disturbed after seeing a couple of seconds of it			0
’ gruesome videos of people being beheaded are to be allowed on @entity3 once again			1
the social network claims that its users should be able to watch and condemn these videos , but not celebrate them one of @entity3 ’s advertisers , car - sharing companty @entity151 , withdrew its adverts in protest , saying : ‘ we do not condone this type of abhorrent content being circulated on @entity3			1
’ dr @entity158 , of suicide prevention group the @entity159 , said : ‘ it only takes seconds of exposure to such graphic material to leave a permanent trace – particularly in a young person ’s mind			0
’ @entity3 may now allow videos of people being beheaded , but there are a number of subjects and clips it will not allow to be published on in its site			1
@entity3 has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and any explicitly sexual content where a child is involved			0
elsewhere , the site imposes ‘ limitations on the display of nudity ’ but does n’t ban it outright - it depends on the context and circumstance			0
female nipples , as a rule , will be removed but male nipples are allowed			0
a photo was famously removed last year when an elbow was mistaken for a female nipple , before being reinstated			0
breastfeeding images were removed in 2012 , but @entity3 ’s @entity191 now states the site ‘ respects people ’s right to share content of personal importance ’ and makes explicit reference to breastfeeding			2
the pictures are allowed if the child is seen ‘ actively nursing ’ but may be removed if it shows the nipple			0
children playing in the bath are accepted as long as they are not graphic and explicit , while sculpture and art work that depicts the naked body is allowed , but real - life images and similar poses are not			0
another photo famously taken down showed @entity210 holding a teddy bear with her microphone positioned in such a way , between the bear ’s legs , that made it look phallic			0
@entity3 removed it for violating the use of ‘ photos that contain nudity , drug use or violence ’			2
any video that condones violence , threatens or is abusive and bullying towards another person or promotes criminal activity is prohibited			0
any promotion or encouragement of self - mutilation , eating disorders of drug abuse is similarly banned			0
@entity3 does not permit hate speech , especially towards individuals , groups , sex , race , ethnicity , disability or sexual orientation – yet will distinguish between ‘ serious and humorous speech ’ and will allow videos and posts that ‘ challenge ideas , institutions and certain practices			2
’ sharing graphic content for ' sadistic pleasure ' is prohibited , yet if the content is shared in the process of reporting current events it is be allowed as long as it balances ‘ the needs of a diverse community			0
’ @entity3 monitors photos , but also relies on its users to report content they feel should be removed			1
if a photo is under investigation it may be temporarily removed while @entity3 looks into the complaint but will be reinstated if it is found not to have breached the code .			2

@entity3 banned decapitation videos in may *due* to psychological *damage*
in *u-turn* it said users should be able to watch and condemn these videos
*hostage* @entity267 , which has @entity95 's *brother* as *trustee* , slams the move
*pm* : *decision* is ' irresponsible ' and @entity3 should ' address *problem* '
following pressure it has removed gory video of woman being beheaded
