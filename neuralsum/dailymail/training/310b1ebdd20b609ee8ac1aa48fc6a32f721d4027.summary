by @entity1 reporter published : 14:36 est , 7 november 2012 updated : 04:53 est , 8 november 2012 three siblings quarrelling over their late mother 's will are risking spending every penny they were about to inherit in the vicious court battle			1
@entity7 claims that there is no evidence that her mother lacked the mental capacity to change her will and cut her brother , @entity13 , out of her £ 120,000 estate			1
mr @entity13 and his other sister , @entity15 , insist the will is invalid and are fighting mrs @entity7 at the @entity17			1
@entity18 : @entity19 and @entity13 contests their sister @entity7 ' appeal against an earlier ruling their their mother was not of sound mind when she excluded @entity13 from her will their mother @entity26 changed her will in the presence of her daughter @entity29 and a solicitor in january 2007 , two years before she died ; lord @entity31 presiding the case commented on the huge legal costs already run up in the dispute , saying : ‘ there is going to be nothing left in this estate			1
‘ one of the sadnesses about this case is that @entity19 - who was a beneficiary in both wills and was in most need of her mother ’s bounty - gets nothing			1
i mean , it is just appalling			2
’ mrs @entity15 , who died 80 years old in may 2009 , changed her will shortly after moving from her home in @entity47 , @entity48 , to a bungalow which was bought for her by her son , a managing director of a recruitment company			0
the reason why she had excluded her son @entity13 from her will , according to the documents , was that she intended to reward him ‘ lifetime provisions ’ by making improvements to the bungalow			1
@entity60 , challenging the will , gave evidence about their mother ’s deteriorating health , in particular memory loss and confusion			2
an @entity68 psychiatry professor also gave evidence , concluding it was likely mrs @entity15 was suffering from a ‘ moderate ’ disorder of the mind at the time			0
expensive squabble : judges at the @entity17 at the @entity75 have yet to pass judgement on the case , but lamented the fact that there will be little to no money left to inherit due to the legal costs following a hearing at @entity84 in january , the will excluding @entity13 was struck in favour of an earlier document			1
in the first will mrs @entity15 divided her assets equally between her three children and was favoured after a judge found that she ‘ loved all her children very much and in equal measure ’			0
mrs @entity7 , who was also ordered to pay £ 18,000 back into her late mother ’s estate , is now appealing against the ruling			2
her lawyers argue there is no evidence to justify the judge ’s conclusion that mrs @entity15 lacked the mental capacity to make a valid will and approve its contents			0
they also point out that the will was drawn up by an experienced solicitor who described the pensioner as being ‘ compos mentis ’			0
@entity108 , for mrs @entity7 , said : ‘ none of the evidence suggests an inability of mrs @entity15 to appreciate and comprehend the claims to which she ought to give effect in her will			2
’ legal representatives of @entity13 and @entity15 say that the there was ‘ serious falling out ’ between mrs @entity7 and her brother in the background of the creation of the 2007 will			1
their counsel , @entity120 said : ‘ the judge found that @entity122 did not intend to exclude her son from the will			0
' she further found that , if @entity122 had intended to cut her son out of the will , she would have told him			0
’ reserving judgment on @entity129 ’ appeal , @entity126 said it was ‘ of importance ’ because of the rights of older people to have their wishes honoured			0
he added : ‘ when a person , towards the end of their life , makes a will , they ought to have their wishes respected unless it is very clear that it was n’t what they wanted			0
