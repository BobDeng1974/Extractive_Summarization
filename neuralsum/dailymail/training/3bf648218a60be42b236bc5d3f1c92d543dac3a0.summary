@entity0 has been suffering in a dark space in recent times but the former world no 1 believes he can start to see some shafts of light at the end of a long tunnel			1
the @entity9 's confidence has taken something of a battering but he was bathed in smiles on sunday after two eagles helped him conclude his @entity15 campaign with a five - under - par 67			1
@entity0 improved with each passing day at the @entity17 's penultimate event of the season , following a poor opening 74 on thursday and subsequent rounds of 73 and 68			1
@entity0 enjoyed a strong finish to the @entity15 in @entity22 last week but @entity0 has had plenty to ponder during his slump in form in the last two years ' it 's been a bit frustrating lately , ' the 36 - year - old said in a typically understated way on a sun - kissed day by the @entity31			1
' i 've been banging my head against a wall for the last few months			0
it 's tough when you know you are a capable player and it 's not quite happening for you			2
' this game will get to you sometimes but i 'm quietly confident with the work i 've been doing with my coach and it 's starting to pay off , ' added @entity0 , who has slipped to 37th in the world having spent 56 weeks at the top of the rankings in 2011 and 2012			1
@entity0 's year - end world ranking : 2009 - 28 2010 - 9 2011 - 1 2012 - 2 2013 - 17 2014 - ? ( current rank 39 ) ' for three or four months there i was n't really making any birdies and this weekend i 've started to score well			1
it 's a good sign that it 's all starting to come back			2
' having endured the agony of missing out on a place in @entity55 's victorious @entity54 team in @entity56 in september , @entity0 reunited with former coach @entity57 after admitting the radical swing change he underwent with @entity59 had not worked			1
' @entity57 and i are doing meticulous work from 150 yards and in , i 'm trying to again be one of the best in the world from that kind of distance , ' he explained			2
' i 'm never going to be a power player so controlling the ball from 150 yards and in is important for me			0
' any time you 're working on those kind of things it 's always difficult because you really want to go out on the course without many thoughts , ' said the four - time @entity54 player			1
' right now , i 've got a few thoughts out there but every day it seems to be getting a little better			0
' the @entity9 was world no 1 but has been searching for the key to win his elusive first major @entity0 's strengths have always lain in his short game , such as his prowess from bunkers @entity0 is regarded as one of the best players never to have won a major and he is now attempting to focus on the areas of his game which once put him on top of the world			1
' i 'm trying to be very good again at what i 'm usually good at			0
i had got away from that for most of this season , ' said the @entity93 - based @entity9 after finishing in a tie for 32nd position in @entity96 with a six - under tally of 282			1
' i do n't want to concentrate too much on my perceived weaknesses , like my driving and long irons , but try and focus on my strengths			0
' @entity0 , who started his round at the 10th on sunday , received the welcome boost of eagle threes at the 18th and fourth holes			2
' it 's been quite a while since i 've had two eagles in the same round , ' he smiled , ' i do n't generally have too many in a year			0
' i finally hit the fairway at the 18th , which helps , and then had a three - wood from about 270 yards , caught a ridge perfectly and wound up eight feet away			0
' then at the fourth i hit a three - iron to tap - in distance			0
they are nice eagles when you do n't have to stress too much about the putts			0
' it sounds like @entity0 has had more than enough stress to contend with in recent months			2
' you definitely start to have doubts and you do n't have as much confidence over the ball , ' he said			0
' you 've got to build that slowly through good practice and good tournament rounds like today			0

@entity0 believes his form is starting to turn around after tough year
@entity0 was world no 1 in 2011 and 2012 but never won a major
@entity9 is now ranked 39th and was not selected for @entity54
he *blames* fall on trying to change his swing in bid to find more power
but after change of coach @entity0 *insists* he is *refocusing* on his strengths
