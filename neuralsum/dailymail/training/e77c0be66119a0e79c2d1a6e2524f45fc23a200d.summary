@entity0 has been handed a two - match ban for his outburst during saturday ’s 2 - 1 win over @entity4			1
much to the dissatisfaction of @entity7 ’s title rivals the player will now miss only @entity7 ’s home game with @entity10 ’ @entity11 on saturday and the home match with @entity13 three days later			1
he will be available for one of the season ’s title deciders away to @entity17 the following weekend			0
pressure had been put on the @entity20 fa to make an example of @entity0 after he slapped @entity4 defender @entity22 at a corner , then kicked @entity24 , and landed another blow on @entity22			1
@entity0 was sent off after kicking out at @entity4 defender @entity26 ( left ) the @entity7 had previously escaped punishment for throwing a punch at @entity22 @entity0 appears to claim there is nothing wrong as the @entity32 defender goes down clutching his face in a final act of petulance , @entity0 takes a backhand swipe at @entity37 before being shown the red card but match referee @entity39 never saw the first incident and only reported the kick on @entity24 in his match report and not the subsequent striking of @entity22			1
@entity39 ’ match report stated : ‘ in minute 83 the player @entity0 was sent off for the following reason : kicking his rival off the ball ’			2
the @entity20 @entity19 ’s disciplinary committee could have asked @entity39 to elaborate on his report but instead have given @entity0 the minimum punishment for the digression outlined by the referee			2
it was @entity0 ’s ninth career red card and he now has eight more than @entity57 who has never been sent off for @entity58 but was red - carded on his debut for @entity60			0
the @entity62 international still has some way to catch @entity64			0
the @entity7 legend currently coaching the club ’s b - team was sent off 14 times in his career			0
@entity0 can only offer a nonchalant shrug as referee @entity71 shows him the red card @entity0 heads into the dressing room before @entity74 scored to earn @entity7 a 2 - 1 victory @entity0 will miss the chance of facing former @entity77 manager @entity10 ' @entity11 @entity0 apologised for the sending off on social media after for forgiveness for his moment of rashness , saying : ' i apologise to everyone and especially edimar for my thoughtless act in the game today '			1
he is also understood to have said sorry to team - mates in monday ’s training session			0
@entity0 ’s red mist comes at a difficult time for @entity7			1
they lost the opening league game of the year against @entity92 , were knocked out of the cup by @entity17 , have a potential @entity95 transfer ban hanging over them , and an improving @entity58 close on their heels			0
on saturday they will have to cope without their talisman as @entity11 come to the @entity103 having already beaten @entity7 once this season .			2

@entity0 was sent off for *lashing* out at @entity4 defender
@entity7 star will miss games against @entity11 and @entity13
