@entity9 is the fourth member of the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) to be jailed this year after the group issued statements attacking the ruling family over its human rights record and calling for democracy			1

but it can also be used at the discretion of judges as an alternative or in addition to other punishments all powerful : @entity37 is the prime minister and he appoints the government , which includes top princes in the roles of foreign , interior , defence and intelligence ministers and today he issued a scathing attack on the ruling elite who exacted the medieval punishment			1
' i am the proud prisoner @entity49 , ' he said in a statement			1
' i read out to you the motives and causes of my imprisonment : my hatred of injustice , the fabrication of pain and misery , taking advantage of passive attitudes , treating them as if they were fools , and denying them their livelihoods for brutal personal ambition			1
' ' this unjust sentence is an honour and pride to @entity72 and a disgrace and shame to @entity75 , ' the activist â€™s brother , @entity67 , tweeted after learning of the sentence late on thursday			1
under @entity4 's sharia or @entity27 law , flogging is mandatory for a number of moral offences such as adultery or being alone in the company of an unrelated person of the opposite sex			1
but it can also be used at the discretion of judges as an alternative or in addition to other punishments			1

cinemas and music concerts are banned , while many restaurants and even some shopping centres cater to families only , especially on holidays			2
religious police roam streets to make sure no unrelated men and women mix. the @entity4 court system is exclusively controlled @entity110 / @entity109 clerics , and bans the employment of @entity113 citizens , especially as judges			2
@entity4 is the world 's leading country in the use of torture - by - flogging , public beheadings and publically crucifying condemned prisoners			2
@entity120 , @entity121 researcher at @entity122 , added : ' it 's just another troubling instance of @entity4 authorities ' absolute refusal to countenance any activism or criticism of @entity4 policies or human rights abuses			2
' a spokesman for the @entity132 said he could not comment on the report or confirm its accuracy			0
@entity135 - allied @entity4 is ruled by the @entity136 together with powerful clerics from the country 's ultra-conservative @entity139 school of @entity141			0

during the @entity160 in early 2011 , protests were restricted to the @entity162 minority in the @entity164 district of @entity165			0
unrest among the @entity141 majority was avoided after @entity37 pledged $ 110 billion in spending on social benefits and top clerics and tribal leaders said people should back the ruling family			0
foreign analysts say there appears to be little public demand for big political changes in @entity4 now , although they point to evidence on social media of growing frustration at corruption , poverty and poor state services			0
