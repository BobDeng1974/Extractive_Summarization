@entity0 has made a blistering start to life at @entity3 , racking up 18 goals , 10 assists and countless plaudits in his first few months in @entity7			1
the @entity9 's work - rate , creativity and finishing mean he 's a firm favourite with fans at the @entity14 as well as one of the first names on @entity18 's team sheet			2
but his form has tailed off in recent weeks , with @entity0 failing to find the net in february , and the former @entity22 star has now gone seven games without a goal			2
@entity0 has been suffering a bit of a drought since @entity27 returned to fitness @entity0 has not scored a goal for @entity3 in his last seven games , providing just one assist in that time the @entity32 forward has been vital to their form this season , but does not look at his best at the moment a hamstring injury , which ruled @entity0 out of games against @entity39 and @entity40 , seemed to stall his season , but there are also concerns about the 26 - year - old 's role in the team since the return from injury of @entity27			1
@entity32 fans had hoped that when @entity27 and @entity0 , @entity3 's two most expensive players ever , played together , @entity18 's side would find another gear			1
but it appears the two struggle to play together			0
@entity0 has not scored a goal with @entity27 on the pitch since october 1 , and the @entity32 win percentage with their two stars playing together is worryingly far lower than when one is absent			1
while results have picked up since the @entity64 's return from injury , the impact on @entity0 's performances is a concern			2
the @entity9 's barren spell has coincided with @entity27 's comeback , and a move away from the central role in which he was excelling			2
@entity0 celebrates scoring against @entity72 in early january , his last goal for the club the @entity9 has scored 18 times since his move from @entity22 , but none since january 11 @entity0 celebrates after scoring against @entity78 , but he generally struggles when @entity27 plays in the @entity81 - winning playmaker 's absence , @entity0 had been operating as @entity3 's @entity82 , with a license to drift all over the pitch and run at the defence			1
but @entity27 has slotted into that role , with great effect , shunting @entity3 's best player this season out to the left wing			1
the effect has been devastating to @entity0 's game			0
in his first 30 appearances for @entity3 he created 74 chances , at a rate of almost two and a half per game			0
in his last seven , he averages around one and a half a game , with only one assist			0
it is a similar story with his shooting			0
his goalless run is the result of having just 13 shots in seven games , of which only five have been on target			0
@entity0 celebrates with @entity108 , who has recently moved to a deep midfield role , to great effect @entity0 has hit the buffers after storming start to his career in @entity114 @entity27 has been in superb form since coming back from injury and slotting into the @entity82 role @entity27 's playmaking , including both assists in a win over @entity121 , has spurred @entity3 onto a winning run in fact he has managed a shot on target every 102 minutes , a poor return compared with the rest of the season , where he had worked the goalkeeper every 57 minutes			1
it is not just @entity0 's position that has changed with @entity27 's return , but also the shape of the team			1
during @entity0 's best run of scoring form this season , when he notched six times in four games during october and november , the @entity32 had two recognised central midfielders in the side			2
early in the season that was usually @entity142 or @entity143 in the holding role alongside @entity145 or @entity146 , but @entity147 , @entity148 and of course the emerging @entity149 have all been involved more recently			0
this gave @entity0 a platform , whether from the wing or a more central position , to focus on attacking			0
he always works hard off the ball , but he needed to worry less about his positioning defensively			0
@entity149 's emergence as a quality holding midfielder has allowed @entity3 to change their system @entity18 has played @entity27 in the middle , leaving @entity0 to help out in a lightweight midfield @entity18 needs to find a way of getting his two stars to play well together as @entity3 push for a top - four finish since @entity27 returned , @entity108 has moved into a deep - lying midfield role to glorious effect , freeing up @entity27 to drift around the midfield picking his passing			1
both men have benefited , and the @entity32 have won seven of their last eight league games			2
but it has meant that @entity0 has had to be more disciplined , tracking back to help out in a light - weight midfield , and spending more time defending than when he was the main man			0
for now , it is a system that appears to be working - while @entity0 's stats falter , @entity3 have been in decent form since @entity27 's return , the aberration against @entity179 aside			1
but with the race for @entity182 football hotting up , @entity18 will want to start getting the best out of his superstar again , alongside - rather than instead of - @entity27 .			0

@entity0 has not scored a goal for seven games
@entity27 's return to fitness has seen @entity0 moved out to the wing
@entity3 's win percentage falls *drastically* when both their stars play
but system seems to be working , with seven wins from eight league games
@entity18 's side take on @entity201 on *wednesday* night
