the @entity1 @entity0 has offered major news organizations a chance to sit down with @entity4 , the embattled attorney general , for a briefing a q - and - a session about his agency 's intrusive surveillance of reporters , but there is one catch : the entire session must be ' off the record , ' meaning reporters could n't write anything at all about it			1
most of the media outlets invited to the meeting have announced that they 're boycotting it , including the @entity21 and @entity22 - the two whose phone records and emails were secretly seized as part of @entity0 investigations into national security leaks			1
and @entity28 , the communications director for the @entity29 , is angry			1
he tweeted thursday that president @entity30 asked @entity4 ' to review how leak investigations are done but some in the media refuse to meet with him			1
' that , @entity28 said , ' [ k ] ind of forfeits your right [ to ] gripe			1
' cue the outrage , which came equally from journalists on the political right and left			0
@entity28 , the @entity41 spokesman who now flacks for the @entity29 , did n't make any friends in the media on thursday @entity28 started the fracas by slamming the @entity21 , @entity22 , the @entity45 , the @entity46 and other news outlets that refused to attend an ' off the record ' briefing with @entity4 , the embattled attorney general @entity51 , an editorial writer at @entity52 - not this news organization 's print edition in @entity55 , but a daily newspaper in @entity57 , @entity50 - snarked in a tweeted reply that ' forfeits your right ' is ' the motto of this administration			1
' ' oh , and @entity28 , ' @entity51 followed up in a later tweet , ' your rights come from @entity65			2
you can not forfeit them			0
' @entity69 media reporter @entity68 was more succinct			1
' @entity70 , @entity28 , ' he tweeted			1
@entity71 , the executive director of the @entity72 , seemed to take joy in seeing the left - leaning @entity69 cross swords with the @entity75			2
his tweeted response consisted of one long guffaw : ' @entity78			0
' @entity68 ' news organization is among a list of very few that have said they will meet with the attorney general on his terms			2
others include @entity85 , the @entity86 , @entity87 , and the @entity88 and @entity89 , which share a @entity91 bureau chief in common			0
@entity69 's @entity68 , who reports on the media , is on a first - name basis with the top @entity29 communicator but did n't like what he heard @entity97 's @entity96 slapped back , referring to the @entity0 's now - scandalous seizure of phone records and emails from @entity21 and @entity22 journalists ' tv 's @entity102 , ' as he 's introduced each night on the @entity104 ' @entity105 , ' took a break from his daily yuk-fest to launch a serious barb in @entity28 's direction @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , the @entity45 and @entity114 have joined @entity22 and the @entity21 in refusing to attend			1
the @entity86 's agreement to meet with @entity4 has raised eyebrows in the nation 's capital , but @entity46 executive editor @entity119 defended his decision on his newspaper 's media blog			1
' i prefer that any meeting be on the record , ' @entity119 said			0
but ' journalists routinely participate in off - the - record sessions , whether they prefer those conditions or not , and then continue to report on events			0
' i am going to this meeting in order to represent our interests as journalists and to raise our concerns			0
i ’ll also listen to what the attorney general has to say			0
i trust that our journalists will report on this as vigorously as they would any other subject			0
@entity142 , the editorial director at @entity143 and a respected voice inside the @entity91 beltway , took isdue with how @entity28 suggested government should balance the press 's @entity148 protections with national security issues is @entity28 right ? journalists do meet with sources for ' off the record ' conversations all the time ... there 's the rub : reporters set the terms			1
sources ca n't force journalists to listen -- something he thinks an experienced political spokesman should know @entity96 , a @entity165 journalist who is a widely acknowledged master of reporting on political archival videos , connected the @entity0 's request for secret meetings with its equally secretive snooping on the @entity21 and @entity22			2
if @entity4 and his staff want reactions from journalists , he tweeted , ' i suppose they can just find how they feel via subpoenaed email and phone records			1
' the @entity178 's house blogger , @entity177 - a conservative humorist who writes under the pseudonym ' @entity180 , ' was quick to pour salt in @entity28 's wounds			1
' notice how people on both sides of the aisle are pointing out how dumb that is ? ' he wrote			1
' you must be doing all kinds of things right			0
' conservative partisans aplenty complemented journalists from left - leaning outlets like @entity69 and @entity97			1
@entity51 is an editorial writer for that ' other ' @entity52 , the newspaper in @entity57 , @entity50 @entity193 , the @entity194 's principal deputy press secretary , took questions from reporters aboard @entity197 on thursday , and the topic quickly turned to @entity4 's attempted charm offensive aimed at journalists			2
' you can understand that a meeting about concerns journalists have about the @entity148 being off the record is sort of on its face hypocritical , do n’t you ? ' asked one reporter , according to the @entity194 's transcript			2
' no , ' @entity193 replied			0
' i do n’t actually see that			0
... i do n’t think there 's any doubting the seriousness with which the attorney general is pursuing what he has identified and what the president has identified as a genuine priority			2
and we are genuinely interested in the input , the opinion , the advice , the expertise of leaders of prominent media organizations			0
' ' is the president at all concerned that @entity4 is just under so much scrutiny at this point that it might affect his ability to get his job done ? ' the reporter pressed @entity193 ? ' not in the least , ' came his reply			2
@entity235 columnist and commentary magazine editor @entity234 sniped at the @entity29 spokesman 's tweet - grammar , among other thigns the @entity240 took issue with @entity28 and hat - tipped the @entity45 for being among the first to show ' some spine ' in turning the administration down flat but reporters themselves - those who tweet , in any event - saw the @entity194 as hypocritical and @entity28 as foolish			1
' wow , ' @entity22 personality @entity102 , a co-star of the nightly show @entity105 , tweeted at @entity249			0
' it 's hard to believe @entity1 are cynical about politics with people like you around			2
' @entity143 editorial editor director @entity142 , a former @entity21 bureau chief in @entity91 , checked his sarcasm at the door and engaged @entity28 seriously			2
' the balance between security / liberty deserves better than your spin , ' he wrote			0
there 's ' lot of spin on both sides , @entity28 wrote , in the his only tweeted reply to a reporter			1
' are journos not going saying they never meet with subjects off the record ? happens everyday			0
' ' on our terms , ' @entity142 snapped			0
' not the government 's			0
' lorem ipsum dolor ' @entity180 , ' the @entity178 's pseudonymous in - house humor blogger , noted the bi-artisan tsunami and kicked @entity28 while he was down			1
his @entity276 avatar is a nod to president @entity30 's autobiographical confession that he once ate dog meat while growing up			0

' some in the media refuse to meet with ' @entity4 , wrote top @entity29 flack @entity28 . ' kind of forfeits your right [ to ] gripe . '
the do staff ' can just find how [ reporters ] feel via subpoenaed email and phone records , ' snarked one @entity97 journalist
' @entity70 , @entity28 , ' came a reply from @entity69 's top media reporter
' notice how people on both sides of the aisle are pointing out how dumb that is ? ' wrote a @entity178 blogger .
