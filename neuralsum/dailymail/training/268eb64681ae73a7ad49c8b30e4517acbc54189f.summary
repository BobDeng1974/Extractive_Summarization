' it was then , with his back to the suv , and as he was in front of it , that he was run over and crushed , ' the attorney added			0
a difficult situation has been made worse by what she described as a ' perception ' that some people have about the riders who participated in the rally on sunday , said ms @entity233 ' they are not gang members			0
they are not thugs , ' mr @entity325 said			0
' they are @entity329 drivers , plumbers , military reservists , musicians			0
